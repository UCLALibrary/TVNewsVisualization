20110131030048.000|20110131030051.000|TR0|As I said, dramatic developments today.  
20110131030051.000|20110131030053.000|TR0|Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel laureate who 
20110131030053.000|20110131030056.000|TR0|returned to Egypt just on Thursday, 
20110131030056.000|20110131030058.000|TR0|appeared in Liberation Square today, which 
20110131030058.000|20110131030101.000|TR0|is the central point where a lot of the 
20110131030101.000|20110131030103.000|TR0|protests are taking place here in Cairo.  
20110131030103.000|20110131030105.000|TR0|He spoke to the crowd. We'll show you what 
20110131030105.000|20110131030108.000|TR0|that was like in just a moment.
20110131030108.000|20110131030110.000|TR0|
20110131030110.000|20110131030113.000|TR0|The curfew is still in effect.  Though, as 
20110131030113.000|20110131030115.000|TR0|you will see in Liberation Square, people 
20110131030115.000|20110131030118.000|TR0|defied the curfew in order to come out in 
20110131030118.000|20110131030120.000|TR0|large numbers.  Right now, the streets 
20110131030120.000|20110131030123.000|TR0|around downtown Cairo are relatively calm, 
20110131030123.000|20110131030125.000|TR0|pretty empty, except for the heavy 
20110131030125.000|20110131030128.000|TR0|presence of Egyptian soldiers manning 
20110131030128.000|20110131030130.000|TR0|tanks and many of the intersections, many 
20110131030130.000|20110131030132.000|TR0|of the roadblocks.
20110131030132.000|20110131030135.000|TR0|
20110131030135.000|20110131030137.000|TR0|There are also large civilian militias, 
20110131030137.000|20110131030140.000|TR0|just people, ordinary civilians who have 
20110131030140.000|20110131030142.000|TR0|armed themselves with kitchen knives, with 
20110131030142.000|20110131030145.000|TR0|bats, with clubs in order to try to 
20110131030145.000|20110131030147.000|TR0|protect their neighborhood since police 
20110131030147.000|20110131030150.000|TR0|are no longer visible on the streets here 
20110131030150.000|20110131030152.000|TR0|in Cairo.  Though we have gotten a report 
20110131030152.000|20110131030155.000|TR0|from the government that police will be 
20110131030155.000|20110131030157.000|TR0|returning to the streets in a few hours on 
20110131030157.000|20110131030200.000|TR0|Monday.  Whether or not that actually 
20110131030200.000|20110131030202.000|TR0|occurs and what kind of an impact that's 
20110131030202.000|20110131030204.000|TR0|going to have, we're just going to have to 
20110131030204.000|20110131030207.000|TR0|wait and see.
20110131030207.000|20110131030209.000|TR0|
20110131030209.000|20110131030212.000|TR0|Here's what we saw, though, after the 
20110131030212.000|20110131030214.000|TR0|curfew, about three hours after the curfew 
20110131030214.000|20110131030217.000|TR0|went into effect at 4:00 on Sunday.  We 
20110131030217.000|20110131030219.000|TR0|went to Tahrir Square, to Liberation 
20110131030219.000|20110131030222.000|TR0|Square, and here is what we saw.

20110131030246.000|20110131030249.000|TR0|saying that their demands haven't changed, 
20110131030249.000|20110131030251.000|TR0|they want Mubarak out.

20110131030311.000|20110131030313.000|TR0|about this is -- for those of us who have 
20110131030313.000|20110131030316.000|TR0|reported from Egypt over the years is 
20110131030316.000|20110131030318.000|TR0|before, anytime you brought out a camera,

20110131030424.000|20110131030427.000|TR0|heard what he said.  And the noise in the

20110131030538.000|20110131030541.000|TR0| Didn't seem to have much impact, though, 
20110131030541.000|20110131030543.000|TR0|on the crowd.  Again, the crowd is defying

20110131030652.000|20110131030654.000|TR0|
20110131030654.000|20110131030657.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  So what's happening?
20110131030657.000|20110131030659.000|TR0|
20110131030659.000|20110131030702.000|TR0|REGAL:  In English or Arabic?
20110131030702.000|20110131030704.000|TR0|
20110131030704.000|20110131030707.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  English would be great, yes.
20110131030707.000|20110131030709.000|TR0|
20110131030709.000|20110131030712.000|TR0|REGAL:  Now we are trying to make a plan, 
20110131030712.000|20110131030714.000|TR0|strategic plan for -- to close all the 
20110131030714.000|20110131030716.000|TR0|borders of Alexandria and the places where 
20110131030716.000|20110131030719.000|TR0|we are seeing -- the districts where we 
20110131030719.000|20110131030721.000|TR0|are seeing well-structured (INAUDIBLE) and 
20110131030721.000|20110131030724.000|TR0|vehicles and all this stuff we are hearing 
20110131030724.000|20110131030726.000|TR0|in the news.
20110131030726.000|20110131030729.000|TR0|
20110131030729.000|20110131030731.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  To protect the -- to protect 
20110131030731.000|20110131030734.000|TR0|the population, yes?
20110131030734.000|20110131030736.000|TR0|
20110131030736.000|20110131030739.000|TR0|REGAL:  Yes, to protect the population.
20110131030739.000|20110131030741.000|TR0|
20110131030741.000|20110131030743.000|TR0|Now, there are a lot of popular committees 
20110131030743.000|20110131030746.000|TR0|everywhere, as you can see. But we are 
20110131030746.000|20110131030748.000|TR0|trying to close some critical points on 
20110131030748.000|20110131030751.000|TR0|different places on the borders.
20110131030751.000|20110131030753.000|TR0|
20110131030753.000|20110131030756.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  How is it going so far?
20110131030756.000|20110131030758.000|TR0|
20110131030758.000|20110131030801.000|TR0|REGAL:  Well, so far, it's starting to 
20110131030801.000|20110131030803.000|TR0|develop, so we hope we can finish it by 
20110131030803.000|20110131030806.000|TR0|5:00 or 6:00.
20110131030806.000|20110131030808.000|TR0|
20110131030808.000|20110131030810.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  And what about the Army?  Are 
20110131030810.000|20110131030813.000|TR0|they -- are you working with the Army?
20110131030813.000|20110131030815.000|TR0|
20110131030815.000|20110131030818.000|TR0|REGAL:  Yes, the Army is very helpful and 
20110131030818.000|20110131030820.000|TR0|working with us and it's a great 
20110131030820.000|20110131030823.000|TR0|cooperation between the masses and the 
20110131030823.000|20110131030825.000|TR0|Army.
20110131030825.000|20110131030828.000|TR0|
20110131030828.000|20110131030830.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  Do you feel that the Army is 
20110131030830.000|20110131030833.000|TR0|on your side or the president's side at 
20110131030833.000|20110131030835.000|TR0|the moment?
20110131030835.000|20110131030838.000|TR0|
20110131030838.000|20110131030840.000|TR0|REGAL:  Look, I cannot be sure of this.  
20110131030840.000|20110131030842.000|TR0|But what I'm very sure is there is a 
20110131030842.000|20110131030845.000|TR0|strong cooperation between the masses and 
20110131030845.000|20110131030847.000|TR0|the Army.  That's what I can tell it so 
20110131030847.000|20110131030850.000|TR0|far.

20110131030857.000|20110131030900.000|TR0|COOPER:  Nic joins us now from Alexandria.
20110131030900.000|20110131030902.000|TR0|
20110131030902.000|20110131030905.000|TR0|I'm amazed at how brave these people you 
20110131030905.000|20110131030907.000|TR0|spoke to seem to be.  I mean, they don't 
20110131030907.000|20110131030909.000|TR0|seem to be frightened.
20110131030909.000|20110131030912.000|TR0|
20110131030912.000|20110131030914.000|TR0|We are having a problem with Nic's 
20110131030914.000|20110131030917.000|TR0|connection.  We are having a problem with 
20110131030917.000|20110131030919.000|TR0|Nic's connection.  We'll try to link up 
20110131030919.000|20110131030922.000|TR0|with him a little bit later on throughout 
20110131030922.000|20110131030924.000|TR0|this hour.
20110131030924.000|20110131030927.000|TR0|
20110131030927.000|20110131030929.000|TR0|But again, the ability for protesters to 
20110131030929.000|20110131030932.000|TR0|try to communicate and organize, it is a 
20110131030932.000|20110131030934.000|TR0|very difficult thing.  Mohamed ElBaradei, 
20110131030934.000|20110131030936.000|TR0|who returned to this country on Thursday, 
20110131030936.000|20110131030939.000|TR0|said that he is in touch with some of the 
20110131030939.000|20110131030941.000|TR0|protest organizers and in communication 
20110131030941.000|20110131030944.000|TR0|with them, has been working with them and 
20110131030944.000|20110131030946.000|TR0|that they've all agreed on the need to 
20110131030946.000|20110131030949.000|TR0|form some sort of a national unity 
20110131030949.000|20110131030951.000|TR0|government or transitional government if 
20110131030951.000|20110131030954.000|TR0|and when Hosni Mubarak steps down.
20110131030954.000|20110131030956.000|TR0|
20110131030956.000|20110131030959.000|TR0|But again, there is no sign of that.  No 
20110131030959.000|20110131031001.000|TR0|indication that the president of Egypt, 
20110131031001.000|20110131031003.000|TR0|who has been the president for some 30 
20110131031003.000|20110131031006.000|TR0|years now, is willing to do just that.
20110131031006.000|20110131031008.000|TR0|
20110131031008.000|20110131031011.000|TR0|We're going to continue our coverage 
20110131031011.000|20110131031013.000|TR0|throughout this hour.  Let's check in with

20110131031023.000|20110131031026.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:

20110131031031.000|20110131031033.000|TR0|As the protesters are organizing, analysts 
20110131031033.000|20110131031035.000|TR0|are trying to figure out what happens 
20110131031035.000|20110131031038.000|TR0|next.  What would President Mubarak's 
20110131031038.000|20110131031040.000|TR0|departure mean for Egypt's peace with 
20110131031040.000|20110131031043.000|TR0|Israel, for example, and how would U.S. - 
20110131031043.000|20110131031045.000|TR0|Middle East relations be impacted?
20110131031045.000|20110131031048.000|TR0|
20110131031048.000|20110131031050.000|TR0|Samer Shehata is an assistant professor of 
20110131031050.000|20110131031053.000|TR0|Arab politics at Georgetown University 
20110131031053.000|20110131031055.000|TR0|here in Washington.  He is joining us now.
20110131031055.000|20110131031058.000|TR0|
20110131031058.000|20110131031100.000|TR0|How popular is Mohamed ElBaradei in Egypt? 
20110131031100.000|20110131031102.000|TR0| Could he emerge as the next leader if 
20110131031102.000|20110131031105.000|TR0|Mubarak goes down?
20110131031105.000|20110131031107.000|TR0|
20110131031107.000|20110131031110.000|TR0|PROF. SAMER SHEHATA, ARAB POLITICS, 
20110131031110.000|20110131031112.000|TR0|GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY:  He certainly could 
20110131031112.000|20110131031115.000|TR0|emerge.  As far as his popularity, he has 
20110131031115.000|20110131031117.000|TR0|a wide- ranging popularity among 
20110131031117.000|20110131031120.000|TR0|intellectuals, among some elements of the 
20110131031120.000|20110131031122.000|TR0|middle classes.  He's relatively unknown 
20110131031122.000|20110131031125.000|TR0|among broader segments of the society.
20110131031125.000|20110131031127.000|TR0|
20110131031127.000|20110131031129.000|TR0|But something very interesting happened 
20110131031129.000|20110131031132.000|TR0|yesterday.  The Muslim Brotherhood 
20110131031132.000|20110131031134.000|TR0|announced that they were supporting Mr. 
20110131031134.000|20110131031137.000|TR0|Baradei as an interim leader for Egypt.  
20110131031137.000|20110131031139.000|TR0|That, I think, is very, very significant, 
20110131031139.000|20110131031142.000|TR0|because before these events, before last 
20110131031142.000|20110131031144.000|TR0|Tuesday, they were considered the largest 
20110131031144.000|20110131031147.000|TR0|opposition movement.  So I think he is 
20110131031147.000|20110131031149.000|TR0|emerging, certainly, as one of, if not the 
20110131031149.000|20110131031152.000|TR0|most important potential leaders in a 
20110131031152.000|20110131031154.000|TR0|democratic Egypt in the future.
20110131031154.000|20110131031157.000|TR0|
20110131031157.000|20110131031159.000|TR0|BLITZER:  He is well-known to a lot of us. 
20110131031159.000|20110131031201.000|TR0| I've met him on many occasions.  Nobel 
20110131031201.000|20110131031204.000|TR0|Prize winner.  Former head of the 
20110131031204.000|20110131031206.000|TR0|International Atomic Energy Agency.  Would 
20110131031206.000|20110131031209.000|TR0|he -- assuming Mubarak goes down and 
20110131031209.000|20110131031211.000|TR0|everybody seems to think it's only a 
20110131031211.000|20110131031214.000|TR0|matter of time, would he likely emerge?  
20110131031214.000|20110131031216.000|TR0|Would Omar Suleiman, the new vice 
20110131031216.000|20110131031219.000|TR0|president, emerge? Or someone else? 
20110131031219.000|20110131031221.000|TR0|SHEHATA:  Well, it depends how Mr. Mubarak 
20110131031221.000|20110131031224.000|TR0|goes down.  If Mr. Mubarak simply resigns 
20110131031224.000|20110131031226.000|TR0|and then Omar Suleiman takes over as 
20110131031226.000|20110131031228.000|TR0|president.  Mr. Baradei still excluded.  
20110131031228.000|20110131031231.000|TR0|The regime can still try to maintain 
20110131031231.000|20110131031233.000|TR0|itself. Can say that we've made a 
20110131031233.000|20110131031236.000|TR0|concession, we're moving forward.
20110131031236.000|20110131031238.000|TR0|
20110131031238.000|20110131031241.000|TR0|I don't think that would be accepted.  
20110131031241.000|20110131031243.000|TR0|People are calling for the removal of Mr. 
20110131031243.000|20110131031246.000|TR0|Mubarak and a change of regime.  Freedom,

20110131031251.000|20110131031253.000|TR0|So -- however, If the entire regime were 
20110131031253.000|20110131031255.000|TR0|to collapse, if the protest were to 
20110131031255.000|20110131031258.000|TR0|continue and overwhelm the regime as it 
20110131031258.000|20110131031300.000|TR0|were, then I think you would have an 
20110131031300.000|20110131031303.000|TR0|interim government and Mr. Baradei would 
20110131031303.000|20110131031305.000|TR0|certainly be a part of it.
20110131031305.000|20110131031308.000|TR0|
20110131031308.000|20110131031310.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I've heard that Mrs. Mubarak has 
20110131031310.000|20110131031313.000|TR0|already left Egypt, maybe in London, that 
20110131031313.000|20110131031315.000|TR0|Gamal Mubarak, the son, already in London. 
20110131031315.000|20110131031318.000|TR0| I don't know what you've heard but there 
20110131031318.000|20110131031320.000|TR0|are a lot of reports out there that they 
20110131031320.000|20110131031322.000|TR0|have left.  What are you hearing?
20110131031322.000|20110131031325.000|TR0|
20110131031325.000|20110131031327.000|TR0|SHEHATA:  I'm hearing the same thing and 
20110131031327.000|20110131031330.000|TR0|I'm hearing the same thing from multiple 
20110131031330.000|20110131031332.000|TR0|sources, from British sources as well as 
20110131031332.000|20110131031335.000|TR0|Arabic satellite sources, that they are in 
20110131031335.000|20110131031337.000|TR0|London right now.  And we also heard 
20110131031337.000|20110131031340.000|TR0|yesterday and this, I think, was confirmed 
20110131031340.000|20110131031342.000|TR0|that there were 17 or 18 private jets that 
20110131031342.000|20110131031345.000|TR0|departed from Egypt and landed in the 
20110131031345.000|20110131031347.000|TR0|Emirates and they included a number of 
20110131031347.000|20110131031350.000|TR0|very prominent Egyptian businessmen, 
20110131031350.000|20110131031352.000|TR0|including Naguib Sawiris, the 64th richest 
20110131031352.000|20110131031354.000|TR0|man in the world, telecommunications 
20110131031354.000|20110131031357.000|TR0|mogul, as well as Ahmed Ezz, a hated 
20110131031357.000|20110131031359.000|TR0|National Democratic Party figure who 
20110131031359.000|20110131031402.000|TR0|resigned several days ago.
20110131031402.000|20110131031404.000|TR0|
20110131031404.000|20110131031407.000|TR0|BLITZER:  If President Mubarak steps down 
20110131031407.000|20110131031409.000|TR0|and everybody seems to think that's going 
20110131031409.000|20110131031412.000|TR0|to happen, could he stay in Egypt or would 
20110131031412.000|20110131031414.000|TR0|he have to flee, go to London, or go to 
20110131031414.000|20110131031417.000|TR0|the Emirates, go to Saudi Arabia, 
20110131031417.000|20110131031419.000|TR0|someplace else?
20110131031419.000|20110131031421.000|TR0|
20110131031421.000|20110131031424.000|TR0|SHEHATA:  Well, again, it depends on what 
20110131031424.000|20110131031426.000|TR0|happens next.  If Omar Suleiman becomes 
20110131031426.000|20110131031429.000|TR0|president and somehow the regime can 
20110131031429.000|20110131031431.000|TR0|maintain itself, and I don't think that's 
20110131031431.000|20110131031434.000|TR0|a likely scenario, then Mr. Mubarak would 
20110131031434.000|20110131031436.000|TR0|have the cover of Omar Suleiman being 
20110131031436.000|20110131031439.000|TR0|president.  It would be somewhat like -- 
20110131031439.000|20110131031441.000|TR0|and this analogy isn't perfect - a Gerald 
20110131031441.000|20110131031444.000|TR0|Ford - Richard Nixon moment.
20110131031444.000|20110131031446.000|TR0|
20110131031446.000|20110131031448.000|TR0|However, if the protesters continue, and I 
20110131031448.000|20110131031451.000|TR0|think this is more likely, and it 
20110131031451.000|20110131031453.000|TR0|overwhelms the state, then Mr. Mubarak 
20110131031453.000|20110131031456.000|TR0|will have to flee for his life and -- but 
20110131031456.000|20110131031458.000|TR0|the point is that people now are saying 
20110131031458.000|20110131031501.000|TR0|that he needs to be held accountable.  He 
20110131031501.000|20110131031503.000|TR0|needs to be held accountable not only for 
20110131031503.000|20110131031506.000|TR0|30 years of authoritarianism but for the 
20110131031506.000|20110131031508.000|TR0|damage that he has caused Egypt and the 
20110131031508.000|20110131031511.000|TR0|lives that have been lost over the last 
20110131031511.000|20110131031513.000|TR0|few days.

20110131031516.000|20110131031518.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Samer Shehata of Georgetown 
20110131031518.000|20110131031520.000|TR0|University, thanks so much for coming in.
20110131031520.000|20110131031523.000|TR0|
20110131031523.000|20110131031525.000|TR0|SHEHATA:  You're welcome.
20110131031525.000|20110131031528.000|TR0|
20110131031528.000|20110131031530.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I know you're watching this 
20110131031530.000|20110131031533.000|TR0|especially closely because you still have 
20110131031533.000|20110131031535.000|TR0|family, a lot of family in Egypt right 
20110131031535.000|20110131031538.000|TR0|now.  We hope all of them are OK. SHEHATA: 
20110131031538.000|20110131031540.000|TR0| Thank you.
20110131031540.000|20110131031543.000|TR0|
20110131031543.000|20110131031545.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Thanks so much for joining us.
20110131031545.000|20110131031547.000|TR0|
20110131031547.000|20110131031550.000|TR0|Isha, this is a story with a lot of 
20110131031550.000|20110131031552.000|TR0|developments happening right now, and I 
20110131031552.000|20110131031555.000|TR0|know you want to update our viewers on 
20110131031555.000|20110131031557.000|TR0|what we know.
20110131031557.000|20110131031600.000|TR0|
20110131031600.000|20110131031602.000|TR0|ISHA SESAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, 
20110131031602.000|20110131031605.000|TR0|absolutely.  Wolf, thank you.
20110131031605.000|20110131031607.000|TR0|
20110131031607.000|20110131031610.000|TR0|Here is what we know.  For American 
20110131031610.000|20110131031612.000|TR0|citizens who want out of Egypt, help is on 
20110131031612.000|20110131031614.000|TR0|the way.  U.S. State Department says 
20110131031614.000|20110131031617.000|TR0|chartered evacuation flights will start 
20110131031617.000|20110131031619.000|TR0|taking off soon.  Anybody taking one of 
20110131031619.000|20110131031622.000|TR0|those planes will have to reimburse the 
20110131031622.000|20110131031624.000|TR0|cost of their seat.  Several other 
20110131031624.000|20110131031627.000|TR0|governments are also scrambling to get 
20110131031627.000|20110131031629.000|TR0|their people out.  U.S. officials are 
20110131031629.000|20110131031632.000|TR0|monitoring the situation but treading 
20110131031632.000|20110131031634.000|TR0|carefully. Defense Secretary Robert Gates 
20110131031634.000|20110131031637.000|TR0|spent part of his weekend on the phone 
20110131031637.000|20110131031639.000|TR0|with his counterpart in both Egypt and 
20110131031639.000|20110131031641.000|TR0|Israel.  Secretary of State Hillary 
20110131031641.000|20110131031644.000|TR0|Clinton pointed to President Mubarak's 
20110131031644.000|20110131031646.000|TR0|speech a few days ago, saying it's time to 
20110131031646.000|20110131031649.000|TR0|back up his talk of democratic and 
20110131031649.000|20110131031651.000|TR0|economic reform with action.
20110131031651.000|20110131031654.000|TR0|
20110131031654.000|20110131031656.000|TR0|And we've seen the protests recently out 
20110131031656.000|20110131031659.000|TR0|of Tunisia, Yemen and now Egypt.  So, 
20110131031659.000|20110131031701.000|TR0|where could this anti-government sentiment 
20110131031701.000|20110131031704.000|TR0|spread next in the region?  That is the 
20110131031704.000|20110131031706.000|TR0|big question.
20110131031706.000|20110131031709.000|TR0|
20110131031709.000|20110131031711.000|TR0|The next domino could be Syria where a 
20110131031711.000|20110131031713.000|TR0|very restrictive Ba'athist regime has been 
20110131031713.000|20110131031716.000|TR0|in charge for four decades now.  I think 
20110131031716.000|20110131031718.000|TR0|you can bet Syrian leaders are watching 
20110131031718.000|20110131031721.000|TR0|events in Egypt very carefully tonight.
20110131031721.000|20110131031723.000|TR0|
20110131031723.000|20110131031726.000|TR0|Now, back to Anderson in Cairo.

20110131031728.000|20110131031731.000|TR0|COOPER:  Isha, we show a force today by 
20110131031731.000|20110131031733.000|TR0|the Mubarak regime.  Fighter jets flying 
20110131031733.000|20110131031736.000|TR0|low over Liberation Square at the 
20110131031736.000|20110131031738.000|TR0|beginning of curfew around 4:00 this 
20110131031738.000|20110131031740.000|TR0|afternoon.  We'll show you what impact it 
20110131031740.000|20110131031743.000|TR0|had on the protesters in the Square, 
20110131031743.000|20110131031745.000|TR0|probably not the impact President Mubarak 
20110131031745.000|20110131031748.000|TR0|had hoped it would have.

20110131031750.000|20110131031753.000|TR0|Also in the hour ahead, we're going to 
20110131031753.000|20110131031755.000|TR0|look at the roots of this uprising, roots 
20110131031755.000|20110131031758.000|TR0|that started not in Egypt but elsewhere in 
20110131031758.000|20110131031800.000|TR0|the region. We'll explain ahead.

20110131031837.000|20110131031839.000|TR0|Nic Robertson, now we lost communication 
20110131031839.000|20110131031842.000|TR0|with him a short time ago. We've

20110131031852.000|20110131031854.000|TR0|the last 24 hours.  How are they 
20110131031854.000|20110131031857.000|TR0|organizing thing?  How are they handling 
20110131031857.000|20110131031859.000|TR0|this protest, getting the message out 
20110131031859.000|20110131031902.000|TR0|because Facebook, Internet is shut down in

20110131031911.000|20110131031914.000|TR0|students, some of them lawyers, some of 
20110131031914.000|20110131031916.000|TR0|them studying such things as security in 
20110131031916.000|20110131031919.000|TR0|society.  They're reduced to drawing maps 
20110131031919.000|20110131031921.000|TR0|on pieces of paper to try and figure out 
20110131031921.000|20110131031924.000|TR0|who gets to guard which neighborhood, how 
20110131031924.000|20110131031926.000|TR0|long they should be there, those sorts of 
20110131031926.000|20110131031929.000|TR0|things.
20110131031929.000|20110131031931.000|TR0|
20110131031931.000|20110131031933.000|TR0|So they're trying to be effective but the 
20110131031933.000|20110131031936.000|TR0|mechanism, the Internet that they used to 
20110131031936.000|20110131031938.000|TR0|spread the word before to build these 
20110131031938.000|20110131031941.000|TR0|protests and get them out on the streets, 
20110131031941.000|20110131031943.000|TR0|they don't have access to that.  You have 
20110131031943.000|20110131031946.000|TR0|a lot of groups now competing within the 
20110131031946.000|20110131031948.000|TR0|different neighborhoods for sort of 
20110131031948.000|20110131031951.000|TR0|dominance.  You see, you have this sort of 
20110131031951.000|20110131031953.000|TR0|intellectuals, if you will, the students, 
20110131031953.000|20110131031956.000|TR0|you have the Muslim Brotherhood, who you'd 
20110131031956.000|20110131031958.000|TR0|see now corralling the demonstrations, a 
20110131031958.000|20110131032000.000|TR0|bigger presence in the demonstrations.
20110131032000.000|20110131032003.000|TR0|
20110131032003.000|20110131032005.000|TR0|And even one neighborhood, and I show you 
20110131032005.000|20110131032008.000|TR0|this here that we picked up, a flyer, 
20110131032008.000|20110131032010.000|TR0|driving through one of the neighborhoods 
20110131032010.000|20110131032013.000|TR0|past the vigilante group.  They handed 
20110131032013.000|20110131032015.000|TR0|this out to us this evening.  And this is 
20110131032015.000|20110131032018.000|TR0|from a group, an Islamist group more 
20110131032018.000|20110131032020.000|TR0|radical, way more radical than the Muslim 
20110131032020.000|20110131032023.000|TR0|Brotherhood.  They're demanding an Islamic 
20110131032023.000|20110131032025.000|TR0|state in Egypt.  So you have all these 
20110131032025.000|20110131032028.000|TR0|different groups.  And it's quite clear 
20110131032028.000|20110131032030.000|TR0|that over time, a struggle is going to 
20110131032030.000|20110131032032.000|TR0|evolve between them.  Who controls what, 
20110131032032.000|20110131032035.000|TR0|where?  Who has the power?  That is 
20110131032035.000|20110131032037.000|TR0|something that appears to be coming down 
20110131032037.000|20110131032040.000|TR0|the line, Anderson.
20110131032040.000|20110131032042.000|TR0|
20110131032042.000|20110131032045.000|TR0|COOPER:  And President Mubarak has 
20110131032045.000|20110131032047.000|TR0|certainly used concern in the West and 
20110131032047.000|20110131032050.000|TR0|even concern here about Islamic 
20110131032050.000|20110131032052.000|TR0|fundamentalists to his advantage over 
20110131032052.000|20110131032055.000|TR0|these last 30 years as a way to stay in 
20110131032055.000|20110131032057.000|TR0|power.
20110131032057.000|20110131032059.000|TR0|
20110131032059.000|20110131032102.000|TR0|On the streets here though, there has been 
20110131032102.000|20110131032104.000|TR0|an uptick in the involvement of folks from 
20110131032104.000|20110131032107.000|TR0|the Muslim Brotherhood and other 
20110131032107.000|20110131032109.000|TR0|organizations.  It does not seem to have a 
20110131032109.000|20110131032112.000|TR0|very religious cast to it. You see a lot 
20110131032112.000|20110131032114.000|TR0|of young students, a lot of people who are 
20110131032114.000|20110131032117.000|TR0|talking about freedom.  Do you see -- is 
20110131032117.000|20110131032119.000|TR0|that the way it is in Alexandria as well?
20110131032119.000|20110131032122.000|TR0|
20110131032122.000|20110131032124.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  You know, I think what you're 
20110131032124.000|20110131032126.000|TR0|seeing here is the -- what the Muslim 
20110131032126.000|20110131032129.000|TR0|Brotherhood are doing is keeping the 
20110131032129.000|20110131032131.000|TR0|demonstrations peaceful.  They're keeping 
20110131032131.000|20110131032134.000|TR0|-- when the demonstrators are out on the 
20110131032134.000|20110131032136.000|TR0|main roads here, they're keeping one side 
20110131032136.000|20110131032139.000|TR0|of the road open for traffic, keeping the 
20110131032139.000|20110131032141.000|TR0|demonstrators on one side, keeping it 
20110131032141.000|20110131032144.000|TR0|under control.
20110131032144.000|20110131032146.000|TR0|
20110131032146.000|20110131032149.000|TR0|Why is the Muslim Brotherhood doing this?  
20110131032149.000|20110131032151.000|TR0|Well, there really are no sort of strong 
20110131032151.000|20110131032154.000|TR0|opposition groups that have the 
20110131032154.000|20110131032156.000|TR0|organization and influence that they do.  
20110131032156.000|20110131032158.000|TR0|So they are really stepping in to fill a 
20110131032158.000|20110131032201.000|TR0|vacuum.  And they say themselves very 
20110131032201.000|20110131032203.000|TR0|clearly that they are moderate Islamist 
20110131032203.000|20110131032206.000|TR0|group, non-violent.  But, of course, 
20110131032206.000|20110131032208.000|TR0|they're policies in the region are vastly 
20110131032208.000|20110131032211.000|TR0|different from President Hosni Mubarak's.  
20110131032211.000|20110131032213.000|TR0|And they do look at the United States and 
20110131032213.000|20110131032216.000|TR0|they do look at Hosni Mubarak as sort of 
20110131032216.000|20110131032218.000|TR0|being side by side in a policy that keeps, 
20110131032218.000|20110131032221.000|TR0|they feel, the Palestinians down. So, they 
20110131032221.000|20110131032223.000|TR0|are voicing on the streets now.  We're 
20110131032223.000|20110131032225.000|TR0|seeing for the first time today here, very 
20110131032225.000|20110131032228.000|TR0|loudly, really, an anti-U.S. sentiment and 
20110131032228.000|20110131032230.000|TR0|we haven't seen that up to now.  But that 
20110131032230.000|20110131032233.000|TR0|is sort of emerging, Anderson.
20110131032233.000|20110131032235.000|TR0|
20110131032235.000|20110131032238.000|TR0|COOPER:  And you can -- I don't know if 
20110131032238.000|20110131032240.000|TR0|you can hear in the background now, call 
20110131032240.000|20110131032243.000|TR0|to prayers.  It is just after 5:00 a.m. 
20110131032243.000|20110131032245.000|TR0|here, day seven of this uprising.  One of 
20110131032245.000|20110131032248.000|TR0|the more dramatic moments that we talked 
20110131032248.000|20110131032250.000|TR0|about a little bit ago was when F-16 
20110131032250.000|20110131032252.000|TR0|fighter jets flew low over Liberation 
20110131032252.000|20110131032255.000|TR0|Square around 3:00 or 4:00 on Sunday 
20110131032255.000|20110131032257.000|TR0|afternoon.  Our Ivan Watson was actually 
20110131032257.000|20110131032300.000|TR0|there on the ground when they flew over.  
20110131032300.000|20110131032302.000|TR0|Here's what he saw.

20110131032315.000|20110131032317.000|TR0|IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This is 
20110131032317.000|20110131032319.000|TR0|an unmistakable show of military force, 
20110131032319.000|20110131032322.000|TR0|fighter jets flying low over Cairo's 
20110131032322.000|20110131032324.000|TR0|Tahrir Square, Liberation Square, which 
20110131032324.000|20110131032327.000|TR0|has been a symbol of defiance.
20110131032327.000|20110131032329.000|TR0|

20110131032334.000|20110131032337.000|TR0|COOPER:  And Ivan Watson joins us now.  
20110131032337.000|20110131032339.000|TR0|And we said it before, but that did not 
20110131032339.000|20110131032342.000|TR0|have probably the impact or the effect 
20110131032342.000|20110131032344.000|TR0|that whoever ordered those planes to fly 
20110131032344.000|20110131032347.000|TR0|overhead wanted.
20110131032347.000|20110131032349.000|TR0|
20110131032349.000|20110131032351.000|TR0|WATSON:  No.  If anything, people said 
20110131032351.000|20110131032354.000|TR0|they were not going to be intimidated. If 
20110131032354.000|20110131032356.000|TR0|it was a means to try to intimidate 
20110131032356.000|20110131032359.000|TR0|people, though, you know, there were the 
20110131032359.000|20110131032401.000|TR0|soldiers in the Square at the same time, 
20110131032401.000|20110131032404.000|TR0|and the demonstrators were handing out 
20110131032404.000|20110131032406.000|TR0|sandwiches and bananas and tea and taking 
20110131032406.000|20110131032409.000|TR0|photos with them on their tanks.  So, 
20110131032409.000|20110131032411.000|TR0|perhaps getting mixed messages from parts 
20110131032411.000|20110131032414.000|TR0|of the Egyptian military right now.
20110131032414.000|20110131032416.000|TR0|
20110131032416.000|20110131032418.000|TR0|COOPER:  You know, before I came here, you 
20110131032418.000|20110131032421.000|TR0|hear, well, look, there's a curfew at 
20110131032421.000|20110131032423.000|TR0|4:00.  You kind of surmise -- that means 
20110131032423.000|20110131032426.000|TR0|there's an effort to impose that curfew.  
20110131032426.000|20110131032428.000|TR0|It doesn't seem like seeing the soldiers 
20110131032428.000|20110131032431.000|TR0|are really trying to impose the curfew.
20110131032431.000|20110131032433.000|TR0|
20110131032433.000|20110131032436.000|TR0|WATSON:  And they've been -- they've been 
20110131032436.000|20110131032438.000|TR0|a little bit more forceful, I think, and 
20110131032438.000|20110131032441.000|TR0|they were not allowing people to 
20110131032441.000|20110131032443.000|TR0|demonstrate here the way they had done two 
20110131032443.000|20110131032445.000|TR0|days ago, let's say.  But so far, they are 
20110131032445.000|20110131032448.000|TR0|allowing people to move around.
20110131032448.000|20110131032450.000|TR0|
20110131032450.000|20110131032453.000|TR0|I think what's interesting, again, is the 
20110131032453.000|20110131032455.000|TR0|neighborhood watch groups that have sprung 
20110131032455.000|20110131032458.000|TR0|up, who have taken upon themselves to stop 
20110131032458.000|20110131032500.000|TR0|cars, to search them.  And now in the 
20110131032500.000|20110131032503.000|TR0|second vigil night that they're doing 
20110131032503.000|20110131032505.000|TR0|this, they have -- again, these are not 
20110131032505.000|20110131032508.000|TR0|people who are trained to be security 
20110131032508.000|20110131032510.000|TR0|officers.  They're doing things like 
20110131032510.000|20110131032513.000|TR0|setting up their own signal systems, using 
20110131032513.000|20110131032515.000|TR0|whistles, for instance, so that they can 
20110131032515.000|20110131032517.000|TR0|call for help from one block to another.
20110131032517.000|20110131032520.000|TR0|
20110131032520.000|20110131032522.000|TR0|And I was talking to one man who said they

20110131033158.000|20110131033200.000|TR0|We're going to have our continuing 
20110131033200.000|20110131033203.000|TR0|coverage.  When we come back, we'll talk 
20110131033203.000|20110131033205.000|TR0|with Ben Wedeman who is in the 
20110131033205.000|20110131033208.000|TR0|neighborhood.  He actually lives in here 
20110131033208.000|20110131033210.000|TR0|in Cairo, trying to literally protect the 
20110131033210.000|20110131033213.000|TR0|street that he lives in, along with his 
20110131033213.000|20110131033215.000|TR0|neighbors.  He went out on an armed patrol 
20110131033215.000|20110131033218.000|TR0|with his neighbors, something that is 
20110131033218.000|20110131033220.000|TR0|happening on just about every block in 
20110131033220.000|20110131033222.000|TR0|nearly every neighborhood that we have 
20110131033222.000|20110131033225.000|TR0|driven through.  People manning 
20110131033225.000|20110131033227.000|TR0|checkpoints by themselves with knives and 
20110131033227.000|20110131033230.000|TR0|clubs to protect from the concern about 
20110131033230.000|20110131033232.000|TR0|looters.  We'll talk to Ben in his home, 
20110131033232.000|20110131033235.000|TR0|coming up.

20110131033254.000|20110131033257.000|TR0|sight and vision.  One was shot at right

20110131033307.000|20110131033309.000|TR0|COOPER:  One of our reporters, Ben 
20110131033309.000|20110131033312.000|TR0|Wedeman, the best reporter we have in this 
20110131033312.000|20110131033314.000|TR0|region, has been covering this from day 
20110131033314.000|20110131033316.000|TR0|one.  I want to show you -- we're going to 
20110131033316.000|20110131033319.000|TR0|talk to him.  He's actually in his 
20110131033319.000|20110131033321.000|TR0|community, the neighborhood where he lives 
20110131033321.000|20110131033324.000|TR0|in Cairo, concerned about the security of 
20110131033324.000|20110131033326.000|TR0|that neighborhood and actually went out on 
20110131033326.000|20110131033329.000|TR0|patrol with some of his neighbors who have 
20110131033329.000|20110131033331.000|TR0|taken matters into their own hands to 
20110131033331.000|20110131033334.000|TR0|protect the block that they live on.
20110131033334.000|20110131033336.000|TR0|
20110131033336.000|20110131033339.000|TR0|But I just want to show you some of his 
20110131033339.000|20110131033341.000|TR0|reporting from way back on Tuesday.  Seems 
20110131033341.000|20110131033344.000|TR0|like a long time ago, but it was just 
20110131033344.000|20110131033346.000|TR0|seven days now. This is some of what he 
20110131033346.000|20110131033348.000|TR0|saw then.

20110131033358.000|20110131033401.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): This unrest 
20110131033401.000|20110131033403.000|TR0|is obviously going to have to cause some 
20110131033403.000|20110131033406.000|TR0|new calculations, political new 
20110131033406.000|20110131033408.000|TR0|calculations.  Anyway, right now, I'm 
20110131033408.000|20110131033411.000|TR0|overwhelmed with tear gas.

20110131033440.000|20110131033442.000|TR0|
20110131033442.000|20110131033445.000|TR0|Ben, I don't know if that seems like a 
20110131033445.000|20110131033447.000|TR0|long time ago to you or short time ago to 
20110131033447.000|20110131033450.000|TR0|you.  It was just seven days ago.  What 
20110131033450.000|20110131033452.000|TR0|surprises you most about what's happening 
20110131033452.000|20110131033455.000|TR0|right now?
20110131033455.000|20110131033457.000|TR0|
20110131033457.000|20110131033500.000|TR0|WEDEMAN:  The speed of it, Anderson.  It's 
20110131033500.000|20110131033502.000|TR0|been so fast, so dramatic, that really 
20110131033502.000|20110131033505.000|TR0|initially all of us, the press, the 
20110131033505.000|20110131033507.000|TR0|protesters, the government, police, 
20110131033507.000|20110131033510.000|TR0|everyone has been taken utterly by 
20110131033510.000|20110131033512.000|TR0|surprise simply how fast all of this has 
20110131033512.000|20110131033514.000|TR0|happened.  And I was -- in fact, I was 
20110131033514.000|20110131033517.000|TR0|having dinner at somebody's house just 
20110131033517.000|20110131033519.000|TR0|across the street from Tahrir Square the 
20110131033519.000|20110131033522.000|TR0|night before the first protests, and most 
20110131033522.000|20110131033524.000|TR0|of us seem to be of the belief that this 
20110131033524.000|20110131033527.000|TR0|would be a day of some protests, but life 
20110131033527.000|20110131033529.000|TR0|would go on. Life has just completely 
20110131033529.000|20110131033532.000|TR0|changed for everyone in Egypt since then. 
20110131033532.000|20110131033534.000|TR0|And we're slowly starting to digest the 
20110131033534.000|20110131033537.000|TR0|significance of it all.  But it does seem 
20110131033537.000|20110131033539.000|TR0|that we're coming to the end of an era 
20110131033539.000|20110131033541.000|TR0|here in Egypt. Most Egyptians I have 
20110131033541.000|20110131033544.000|TR0|spoken to say it's just impossible for 
20110131033544.000|20110131033546.000|TR0|President Hosni Mubarak to carry under the 
20110131033546.000|20110131033549.000|TR0|pretense that he's the president of all 
20110131033549.000|20110131033551.000|TR0|Egyptians -- Anderson.

20110131033554.000|20110131033556.000|TR0|COOPER:  Uniformed police have been off 
20110131033556.000|20110131033559.000|TR0|the streets.  There is a report that 
20110131033559.000|20110131033601.000|TR0|police may come back tomorrow on Monday on 
20110131033601.000|20110131033604.000|TR0|the streets here.  We're going to have to 
20110131033604.000|20110131033606.000|TR0|wait and see on that.
20110131033606.000|20110131033608.000|TR0|
20110131033608.000|20110131033611.000|TR0|Are the secret police, the plainclothes 
20110131033611.000|20110131033613.000|TR0|police, the ones who roughed you up 
20110131033613.000|20110131033616.000|TR0|several days ago and have roughed up a lot 
20110131033616.000|20110131033618.000|TR0|of people and dragged people away, are 
20110131033618.000|20110131033621.000|TR0|they still out on the streets?
20110131033621.000|20110131033623.000|TR0|
20110131033623.000|20110131033626.000|TR0|WEDEMAN:  It appears they are, although I 
20110131033626.000|20110131033628.000|TR0|think they're keeping a fairly low profile 
20110131033628.000|20110131033631.000|TR0|and aware at this point that Egyptians 
20110131033631.000|20110131033633.000|TR0|have learned that they are powerful, too, 
20110131033633.000|20110131033635.000|TR0|and that they can fight back.
20110131033635.000|20110131033638.000|TR0|
20110131033638.000|20110131033640.000|TR0|In my neighborhood, speaking to my 
20110131033640.000|20110131033643.000|TR0|neighbors, there's a new awareness that 
20110131033643.000|20110131033645.000|TR0|what the police did, ordinary citizens can 
20110131033645.000|20110131033648.000|TR0|do, that is maintain security without the 
20110131033648.000|20110131033650.000|TR0|kind of petty corruption, without the 
20110131033650.000|20110131033653.000|TR0|police brutality that created such a 
20110131033653.000|20110131033655.000|TR0|negative aura around the police.
20110131033655.000|20110131033658.000|TR0|
20110131033658.000|20110131033700.000|TR0|As far as the secret police is concerned, 
20110131033700.000|20110131033703.000|TR0|they're not as apparent on the streets as 
20110131033703.000|20110131033705.000|TR0|before.  But, of course, the worry of many 
20110131033705.000|20110131033707.000|TR0|people is that given the orders, they can 
20110131033707.000|20110131033710.000|TR0|go back and create the same kind of havoc 
20110131033710.000|20110131033712.000|TR0|that we saw them doing during the days of 
20110131033712.000|20110131033715.000|TR0|protest -- Anderson.
20110131033715.000|20110131033717.000|TR0|
20110131033717.000|20110131033720.000|TR0|COOPER:  Just one final question, Ben.  In 
20110131033720.000|20110131033722.000|TR0|the United States, there's concern among 
20110131033722.000|20110131033725.000|TR0|some quarters about Islamists gaining 
20110131033725.000|20110131033727.000|TR0|power, taking control here in Egypt if 
20110131033727.000|20110131033730.000|TR0|Mubarak left.  That is certainly something 
20110131033730.000|20110131033732.000|TR0|President Mubarak has used over his reign 
20110131033732.000|20110131033734.000|TR0|to continue Western -- to support Western 
20110131033734.000|20110131033737.000|TR0|support and to garner support here.  How 
20110131033737.000|20110131033739.000|TR0|realistic is that?  What sort of power do 
20110131033739.000|20110131033742.000|TR0|they have here in and, moving forward if 
20110131033742.000|20110131033744.000|TR0|Mubarak left, what sort of power would 
20110131033744.000|20110131033747.000|TR0|they have?
20110131033747.000|20110131033749.000|TR0|
20110131033749.000|20110131033752.000|TR0|WEDEMAN:  Most Egyptian analysts believe 
20110131033752.000|20110131033754.000|TR0|that if there were free and fair 
20110131033754.000|20110131033757.000|TR0|elections, that the Muslim Brotherhood and 
20110131033757.000|20110131033759.000|TR0|similar groups would win around 30 to 35 
20110131033759.000|20110131033801.000|TR0|percent of the vote.
20110131033801.000|20110131033804.000|TR0|
20110131033804.000|20110131033806.000|TR0|But certainly  not only has the Mubarak 
20110131033806.000|20110131033809.000|TR0|government exaggerated the so- called 
20110131033809.000|20110131033811.000|TR0|Islamic threat in Egypt to the United 
20110131033811.000|20110131033814.000|TR0|States, but they did that to a great 
20110131033814.000|20110131033816.000|TR0|extent with the Egyptian people as well.  
20110131033816.000|20110131033819.000|TR0|Every time elections would come around, 
20110131033819.000|20110131033821.000|TR0|they would send out a message, either you 
20110131033821.000|20110131033824.000|TR0|vote for Mubarak, who will protect secular 
20110131033824.000|20110131033826.000|TR0|liberal Christian Egyptians or you vote 
20110131033826.000|20110131033829.000|TR0|for the Muslim Brotherhood and you will 
20110131033829.000|20110131033831.000|TR0|pay the price.
20110131033831.000|20110131033833.000|TR0|
20110131033833.000|20110131033836.000|TR0|But that sort of blackmail, so to speak, 
20110131033836.000|20110131033838.000|TR0|doesn't really work anymore among ordinary 
20110131033838.000|20110131033841.000|TR0|Egyptians.  They see that the -- that the 
20110131033841.000|20110131033843.000|TR0|Muslim Brotherhood isn't the sort of 
20110131033843.000|20110131033846.000|TR0|threat that President Mubarak and the 
20110131033846.000|20110131033848.000|TR0|government always said it was -- Anderson.
20110131033848.000|20110131033851.000|TR0|
20110131033851.000|20110131033853.000|TR0|COOPER:  Ben, we'll continue to check in 
20110131033853.000|20110131033856.000|TR0|with you.  Now let's go to Wolf in 
20110131033856.000|20110131033858.000|TR0|Washington.
20110131033858.000|20110131033900.000|TR0|
20110131033900.000|20110131033903.000|TR0|Wolf?
20110131033903.000|20110131033905.000|TR0|
20110131033905.000|20110131033908.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Anderson, American diplomacy 
20110131033908.000|20110131033910.000|TR0|right now facing a tough, tough test.  
20110131033910.000|20110131033913.000|TR0|U.S. strategic interests are colliding 
20110131033913.000|20110131033915.000|TR0|with the political uprising fueled by 
20110131033915.000|20110131033918.000|TR0|anger at a U.S.-backed president in Egypt.

20110131033920.000|20110131033923.000|TR0|Nick Burns is an expert at navigating 
20110131033923.000|20110131033925.000|TR0|global crisis.  He's a former U.S. 
20110131033925.000|20110131033927.000|TR0|diplomat, was the undersecretary of state. 
20110131033927.000|20110131033930.000|TR0| He's now a professor at Harvard's Kennedy 
20110131033930.000|20110131033932.000|TR0|School of Government.
20110131033932.000|20110131033935.000|TR0|
20110131033935.000|20110131033937.000|TR0|In terms of -- on a scale of 1 to 10, 
20110131033937.000|20110131033940.000|TR0|Nick, 10 being the worst crisis, where 
20110131033940.000|20110131033942.000|TR0|would you rate this one?
20110131033942.000|20110131033945.000|TR0|
20110131033945.000|20110131033947.000|TR0|NICHOLAS BURNS, FORMER U.S. UNDERSECRETARY 
20110131033947.000|20110131033950.000|TR0|OF STATE:  This is up to 8 or 9 already, 
20110131033950.000|20110131033952.000|TR0|Wolf.  You know, the consequences of 
20110131033952.000|20110131033954.000|TR0|instability in Egypt to the United States 
20110131033954.000|20110131033957.000|TR0|are really, really important.  This 
20110131033957.000|20110131033959.000|TR0|country, I think, is the most important 
20110131033959.000|20110131034002.000|TR0|U.S. partner in the Middle East.
20110131034002.000|20110131034004.000|TR0|
20110131034004.000|20110131034007.000|TR0|And so, as you rightly said, the strategic 
20110131034007.000|20110131034009.000|TR0|interests here of the United States are on 
20110131034009.000|20110131034012.000|TR0|the line.  But, as you know, and as 
20110131034012.000|20110131034014.000|TR0|President Obama and Secretary Clinton have 
20110131034014.000|20110131034017.000|TR0|been saying, we are a democratic country, 
20110131034017.000|20110131034019.000|TR0|we affirm our own democratic values, we 
20110131034019.000|20110131034022.000|TR0|have to support the right of Egyptians for 
20110131034022.000|20110131034024.000|TR0|freedom of speech and assembly, to 
20110131034024.000|20110131034026.000|TR0|demonstrate peacefully.  And so, we've 
20110131034026.000|20110131034029.000|TR0|seen a very difficult balancing act for 
20110131034029.000|20110131034031.000|TR0|the United States over the last seven days.
20110131034031.000|20110131034034.000|TR0|
20110131034034.000|20110131034036.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Should the president of the 
20110131034036.000|20110131034039.000|TR0|United States pick up the phone and call 
20110131034039.000|20110131034041.000|TR0|President Mubarak and say, guess what, 
20110131034041.000|20110131034044.000|TR0|it's over, it's time for you to leave, 
20110131034044.000|20110131034046.000|TR0|begin that process?
20110131034046.000|20110131034049.000|TR0|
20110131034049.000|20110131034051.000|TR0|BURNS:  You know, I thought when President 
20110131034051.000|20110131034053.000|TR0|Obama spoke on Friday night, he got it 
20110131034053.000|20110131034056.000|TR0|just about right.  He made a quite 
20110131034056.000|20110131034058.000|TR0|forceful statement, for change in Egypt, 
20110131034058.000|20110131034101.000|TR0|for the government to open up, to allow 
20110131034101.000|20110131034103.000|TR0|reform, to move forward.  I also thought 
20110131034103.000|20110131034106.000|TR0|it was appropriate for the president the 
20110131034106.000|20110131034108.000|TR0|other night not to call publicly for 
20110131034108.000|20110131034111.000|TR0|President Mubarak to resign.
20110131034111.000|20110131034113.000|TR0|
20110131034113.000|20110131034116.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I'm not saying publicly, I'm 
20110131034116.000|20110131034118.000|TR0|saying -- I'm asking privately. Should the 
20110131034118.000|20110131034120.000|TR0|president tell Mubarak privately it's over?
20110131034120.000|20110131034123.000|TR0|
20110131034123.000|20110131034125.000|TR0|BURNS:  I was just going to say, Wolf, 
20110131034125.000|20110131034128.000|TR0|this is not all about us.  It's really 
20110131034128.000|20110131034130.000|TR0|about the Egyptians.  They're the ones who 
20110131034130.000|20110131034133.000|TR0|have to steer this forward.  I think that 
20110131034133.000|20110131034135.000|TR0|President Mubarak seems to be losing 
20110131034135.000|20110131034138.000|TR0|control of the streets of Alexandria and 
20110131034138.000|20110131034140.000|TR0|Cairo.  The shocking absence of security 
20110131034140.000|20110131034143.000|TR0|forces, the disorder and the mistakes that 
20110131034143.000|20110131034145.000|TR0|President Mubarak made last week in using 
20110131034145.000|20110131034148.000|TR0|excessive force against the demonstrators.
20110131034148.000|20110131034150.000|TR0|
20110131034150.000|20110131034152.000|TR0|So I think it is appropriate at some point 
20110131034152.000|20110131034155.000|TR0|in the next day or two for the U.S. to be 
20110131034155.000|20110131034157.000|TR0|saying privately that the government has 
20110131034157.000|20110131034200.000|TR0|to move forward.  That means that 
20110131034200.000|20110131034202.000|TR0|President Mubarak has to declare publicly, 
20110131034202.000|20110131034205.000|TR0|I think, that he's not going to run in the 
20110131034205.000|20110131034207.000|TR0|September elections nor is his son, Gamal, 
20110131034207.000|20110131034210.000|TR0|that he's going to open up this process to 
20110131034210.000|20110131034212.000|TR0|a truly -- in a truly democratic way to 
20110131034212.000|20110131034215.000|TR0|allow people like Mohamed ElBaradei, whom 
20110131034215.000|20110131034217.000|TR0|you saw on the streets of Cairo today, to 
20110131034217.000|20110131034219.000|TR0|contest these elections. And I think if he 
20110131034219.000|20110131034222.000|TR0|doesn't do that, we're going to see rapid 
20110131034222.000|20110131034224.000|TR0|change on the streets and rapid change 
20110131034224.000|20110131034227.000|TR0|politically in Egypt. BLITZER:  Is it your 
20110131034227.000|20110131034229.000|TR0|sense that the longer he delays that, the 
20110131034229.000|20110131034232.000|TR0|worse potentially it is for everyone?
20110131034232.000|20110131034234.000|TR0|
20110131034234.000|20110131034237.000|TR0|BURNS:  My sense is that President Mubarak 
20110131034237.000|20110131034239.000|TR0|-- President Mubarak is a very serious, 
20110131034239.000|20110131034242.000|TR0|sophisticated, experienced person.  And I 
20110131034242.000|20110131034244.000|TR0|had hoped that he would see the need last 
20110131034244.000|20110131034246.000|TR0|week to allow for a process of reform to 
20110131034246.000|20110131034249.000|TR0|begin.  He hasn't done that.  By 
20110131034249.000|20110131034251.000|TR0|appointing Omar Suleiman as his vice 
20110131034251.000|20110131034254.000|TR0|president is really just more of the same, 
20110131034254.000|20110131034256.000|TR0|it's military power.
20110131034256.000|20110131034259.000|TR0|
20110131034259.000|20110131034301.000|TR0|The military is an important institution 
20110131034301.000|20110131034304.000|TR0|in Egyptian society.  We should hope that 
20110131034304.000|20110131034306.000|TR0|the military will back a period of 
20110131034306.000|20110131034309.000|TR0|transition, a period leading to elections 
20110131034309.000|20110131034311.000|TR0|and hopefully allow for civil society to 
20110131034311.000|20110131034313.000|TR0|grow in Egypt as the country has never 
20110131034313.000|20110131034316.000|TR0|known democracy in its entire history, to 
20110131034316.000|20110131034318.000|TR0|give the Egyptian people a chance in an 
20110131034318.000|20110131034321.000|TR0|orderly, peaceful way towards an election.
20110131034321.000|20110131034323.000|TR0|
20110131034323.000|20110131034326.000|TR0|Wolf, that's the best thing that I can see 
20110131034326.000|20110131034328.000|TR0|happening now, but the government of Egypt 
20110131034328.000|20110131034331.000|TR0|needs to get behind that and make it 
20110131034331.000|20110131034333.000|TR0|absolutely clear that it favors reform.  
20110131034333.000|20110131034336.000|TR0|It has not done that yet, and you see the 
20110131034336.000|20110131034338.000|TR0|crowds growing in the streets of Cairo and 
20110131034338.000|20110131034341.000|TR0|Alexandria.
20110131034341.000|20110131034343.000|TR0|
20110131034343.000|20110131034345.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes, that would be the best-case 
20110131034345.000|20110131034348.000|TR0|scenario if in fact that happens from the 
20110131034348.000|20110131034350.000|TR0|U.S. perspective and from the Egyptian 
20110131034350.000|20110131034353.000|TR0|perspective. But at least as of right now, 
20110131034353.000|20110131034355.000|TR0|everything that President Mubarak is 
20110131034355.000|20110131034358.000|TR0|saying doesn't indicate he is ready to 
20110131034358.000|20110131034400.000|TR0|give up, at least not yet.
20110131034400.000|20110131034403.000|TR0|
20110131034403.000|20110131034405.000|TR0|Nick, thanks very much for joining us.

20110131034417.000|20110131034420.000|TR0|ISHA SESAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, 
20110131034420.000|20110131034422.000|TR0|coming up, a walk through the dangerous 
20110131034422.000|20110131034425.000|TR0|streets of Alexandria and Cairo.  Our CNN 
20110131034425.000|20110131034427.000|TR0|reporters take you straight to the scene 
20110131034427.000|20110131034430.000|TR0|of what is becoming a lawless situation

20110131034628.000|20110131034630.000|TR0|in Abu Zaabal, a gun battle was still 
20110131034630.000|20110131034632.000|TR0|raging inside.  The residents advised us 
20110131034632.000|20110131034635.000|TR0|to leave.  Inmates had escaped, they told 
20110131034635.000|20110131034637.000|TR0|us, and stolen many weapons from the 
20110131034637.000|20110131034640.000|TR0|building's arsenal.

20110131034647.000|20110131034650.000|TR0|the prisoners got out and took all the

20110131034702.000|20110131034704.000|TR0|dead bodies on the premises.  And no

20110131034707.000|20110131034709.000|TR0|enforcement.  We came past half a dozen

20110131035108.000|20110131035110.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Nic Robertson doing some amazing 
20110131035110.000|20110131035113.000|TR0|reporting for us from Alexandria.
20110131035113.000|20110131035115.000|TR0|
20110131035115.000|20110131035117.000|TR0|With Egypt appearing to be on the brink of 
20110131035117.000|20110131035120.000|TR0|new leadership, right now analysts are 
20110131035120.000|20110131035122.000|TR0|trying to connect the dots on how it will 
20110131035122.000|20110131035125.000|TR0|impact the new future if President Mubarak 
20110131035125.000|20110131035127.000|TR0|is out and everyone seems to think he will 
20110131035127.000|20110131035130.000|TR0|be out, it's only a matter of time.  What 
20110131035130.000|20110131035132.000|TR0|will happen to Egypt's peace with Israel, 
20110131035132.000|20110131035135.000|TR0|for example.  If a new president comes in, 
20110131035135.000|20110131035137.000|TR0|how will that affect U.S. relations 
20110131035137.000|20110131035140.000|TR0|throughout the region?
20110131035140.000|20110131035142.000|TR0|
20110131035142.000|20110131035145.000|TR0|Let's discuss with Professor Fouad Ajami  
20110131035145.000|20110131035147.000|TR0|He's professor of Middle East Studies at 
20110131035147.000|20110131035149.000|TR0|the Johns Hopkins University's School of 
20110131035149.000|20110131035152.000|TR0|Advanced International Studies. Professor 
20110131035152.000|20110131035154.000|TR0|Ajami, if the president of the United 
20110131035154.000|20110131035157.000|TR0|States called you right now and said, 
20110131035157.000|20110131035159.000|TR0|Professor Ajami, what should we do, what 
20110131035159.000|20110131035202.000|TR0|would you tell President Obama?
20110131035202.000|20110131035204.000|TR0|
20110131035204.000|20110131035207.000|TR0|PROF. FOUAN AJAMI, MIDDLE EAST STUDIES, 
20110131035207.000|20110131035209.000|TR0|JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV.:  Well, I have a 
20110131035209.000|20110131035212.000|TR0|feeling this president would not call me 
20110131035212.000|20110131035214.000|TR0|because I have been very critical of him.  
20110131035214.000|20110131035216.000|TR0|I think there is something wrong with our 
20110131035216.000|20110131035219.000|TR0|posture toward Egypt.  There is something 
20110131035219.000|20110131035221.000|TR0|wrong with the American inability to 
20110131035221.000|20110131035224.000|TR0|connect with the aspirations of the 
20110131035224.000|20110131035226.000|TR0|Egyptians for a change.  There is 
20110131035226.000|20110131035229.000|TR0|something wrong with our secretary of 
20110131035229.000|20110131035231.000|TR0|state saying that the Egyptian regime is 
20110131035231.000|20110131035234.000|TR0|stable when she knew better.  There is 
20110131035234.000|20110131035236.000|TR0|something wrong with our Vice President 
20110131035236.000|20110131035239.000|TR0|Biden saying that Hosni Mubarak is not a 
20110131035239.000|20110131035241.000|TR0|dictator when every child in Egypt that we 
20110131035241.000|20110131035243.000|TR0|see and every reporter is showing you 
20110131035243.000|20110131035246.000|TR0|insists that Hosni Mubarak is a dictator.
20110131035246.000|20110131035248.000|TR0|
20110131035248.000|20110131035251.000|TR0|So I think there is some real chaos.  Not 
20110131035251.000|20110131035253.000|TR0|only there is chaos on the streets of 
20110131035253.000|20110131035256.000|TR0|Cairo but there's really chaos here on our 
20110131035256.000|20110131035258.000|TR0|end -- what to do about Egypt and how to 
20110131035258.000|20110131035301.000|TR0|understand Egypt.
20110131035301.000|20110131035303.000|TR0|
20110131035303.000|20110131035306.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So what should the U.S. do?
20110131035306.000|20110131035308.000|TR0|
20110131035308.000|20110131035310.000|TR0|AJAMI:  Well, I think, look, it's a long 
20110131035310.000|20110131035313.000|TR0|story and we have come to this -- I mean, 
20110131035313.000|20110131035315.000|TR0|this Egyptian protest is happening without 
20110131035315.000|20110131035318.000|TR0|any inspiration from the United States.
20110131035318.000|20110131035320.000|TR0|
20110131035320.000|20110131035323.000|TR0|I mean, if you really look at what's 
20110131035323.000|20110131035325.000|TR0|happening, not only in Egypt but if you 
20110131035325.000|20110131035328.000|TR0|widen the lens, and you take a look at the 
20110131035328.000|20110131035330.000|TR0|Arab world as a whole, you see that there 
20110131035330.000|20110131035333.000|TR0|is a kind of irrelevance of American power 
20110131035333.000|20110131035335.000|TR0|because, in fact, the message was sent out 
20110131035335.000|20110131035338.000|TR0|early on in the Obama administration, that 
20110131035338.000|20110131035340.000|TR0|we do not interfere in the internal 
20110131035340.000|20110131035342.000|TR0|affairs of this autocracies but we are 
20110131035342.000|20110131035345.000|TR0|invested in these autocracies.
20110131035345.000|20110131035347.000|TR0|
20110131035347.000|20110131035350.000|TR0|Our treasure is invested in Egypt, and we 
20110131035350.000|20110131035352.000|TR0|have this longstanding interest in Egypt, 
20110131035352.000|20110131035355.000|TR0|and we are very timid because we insist 
20110131035355.000|20110131035357.000|TR0|that should the despot fail, should the 
20110131035357.000|20110131035400.000|TR0|despot be removed, should he and his 
20110131035400.000|20110131035402.000|TR0|family leave, we insist that Egypt has no 
20110131035402.000|20110131035405.000|TR0|other option but Islamic fundamentalism.  
20110131035405.000|20110131035407.000|TR0|It's a kind of intellectual poverty, and 
20110131035407.000|20110131035409.000|TR0|it's hard.
20110131035409.000|20110131035412.000|TR0|
20110131035412.000|20110131035414.000|TR0|BLITZER:  If President Mubarak were 
20110131035414.000|20110131035417.000|TR0|watching CNN International right now and 
20110131035417.000|20110131035419.000|TR0|he might be, we don't know if he is, but 
20110131035419.000|20110131035422.000|TR0|look in the camera and talk to President 
20110131035422.000|20110131035424.000|TR0|Mubarak and what would you say to him?
20110131035424.000|20110131035427.000|TR0|
20110131035427.000|20110131035429.000|TR0|AJAMI:  Well, look, President Mubarak had 
20110131035429.000|20110131035432.000|TR0|-- he's been in power, as we all know, 30 
20110131035432.000|20110131035434.000|TR0|years.  I think he had 12 good years.  He 
20110131035434.000|20110131035436.000|TR0|was the son of Egypt.  He was a man who 
20110131035436.000|20110131035439.000|TR0|rose from the Armed Forces.  He cared 
20110131035439.000|20110131035441.000|TR0|about his country.  He was a modest man.  
20110131035441.000|20110131035444.000|TR0|There is a general who was of Mubarak's 
20110131035444.000|20110131035446.000|TR0|generation and Mubarak's class, if you 
20110131035446.000|20110131035449.000|TR0|will, in the military, who described 
20110131035449.000|20110131035451.000|TR0|Mubarak to me as a civil servant with the 
20110131035451.000|20110131035454.000|TR0|rank of president.  This is long gone now.
20110131035454.000|20110131035456.000|TR0|
20110131035456.000|20110131035459.000|TR0|So, 12 good years he rendered service to 
20110131035459.000|20110131035501.000|TR0|the Egyptians, then finally he put 
20110131035501.000|20110131035504.000|TR0|together this unbelievable autocratic 
20110131035504.000|20110131035506.000|TR0|state.  The Ministry of Interior has 1.7 
20110131035506.000|20110131035508.000|TR0|million people working for it.  The whole 
20110131035508.000|20110131035511.000|TR0|treasure of Egypt and the effort of Egypt 
20110131035511.000|20110131035513.000|TR0|and the effort of Mubarak has not been 
20110131035513.000|20110131035516.000|TR0|about developing Egypt, solving the 
20110131035516.000|20110131035518.000|TR0|poverty of Egypt, dealing with the 
20110131035518.000|20110131035521.000|TR0|problems of Egypt.
20110131035521.000|20110131035523.000|TR0|
20110131035523.000|20110131035526.000|TR0|It's been about simply the police state 
20110131035526.000|20110131035528.000|TR0|that he has put together, and there was a 
20110131035528.000|20110131035531.000|TR0|demeaning of Egypt to insist that a son of 
20110131035531.000|20110131035533.000|TR0|his would have to be president.  I mean, 
20110131035533.000|20110131035535.000|TR0|to be tempted to go that dynastic route, 
20110131035535.000|20110131035538.000|TR0|over 80 million people, the pact between 
20110131035538.000|20110131035540.000|TR0|Mubarak and his people has really been 
20110131035540.000|20110131035543.000|TR0|severed and broken.
20110131035543.000|20110131035545.000|TR0|
20110131035545.000|20110131035548.000|TR0|He can only do one thing now for the 
20110131035548.000|20110131035550.000|TR0|Egyptians.  He can simply step aside, as 
20110131035550.000|20110131035553.000|TR0|the Egyptians over and over again, when 
20110131035553.000|20110131035555.000|TR0|you hear, when you see these crowds, 
20110131035555.000|20110131035558.000|TR0|they're saying one word, derhal (ph), 
20110131035558.000|20110131035600.000|TR0|which means just be gone, leave.  And this 
20110131035600.000|20110131035602.000|TR0|is really what -- there is -- the moral 
20110131035602.000|20110131035605.000|TR0|pact of Mubarak is severed.
20110131035605.000|20110131035607.000|TR0|
20110131035607.000|20110131035610.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Tunisia, Egypt, what's next?  
20110131035610.000|20110131035612.000|TR0|The next six months, look ahead for us, 
20110131035612.000|20110131035615.000|TR0|Professor Ajami.  What do you see?
20110131035615.000|20110131035617.000|TR0|
20110131035617.000|20110131035620.000|TR0|AJAMI:  Well, you know, it's very hard.  
20110131035620.000|20110131035622.000|TR0|As someone said, it's hard to predict 
20110131035622.000|20110131035625.000|TR0|particularly the future.  We don't really 
20110131035625.000|20110131035627.000|TR0|know.  We don't even know if this 
20110131035627.000|20110131035629.000|TR0|upheaval, this tsunami that hit the Arab 
20110131035629.000|20110131035632.000|TR0|world -- look a man in Tunisia sets 
20110131035632.000|20110131035634.000|TR0|himself ablaze in a forgotten, forlorn 
20110131035634.000|20110131035637.000|TR0|Tunisian town and then you see the envy of 
20110131035637.000|20110131035639.000|TR0|Tunis, the Tunisia envy, if you will, in 
20110131035639.000|20110131035642.000|TR0|every Arab county.
20110131035642.000|20110131035644.000|TR0|
20110131035644.000|20110131035647.000|TR0|What you have are these decadent regimes, 
20110131035647.000|20110131035649.000|TR0|autocratic regimes ruled by old men, ruled 
20110131035649.000|20110131035652.000|TR0|by people who loot these countries, 
20110131035652.000|20110131035654.000|TR0|whether it's Libya, whether it's Syria, 
20110131035654.000|20110131035657.000|TR0|whether it's Algeria, whether it's 
20110131035657.000|20110131035659.000|TR0|Tunisia, whether it's Egypt.  Those are a 
20110131035659.000|20110131035701.000|TR0|band of regimes ruled by a man at the top 
20110131035701.000|20110131035704.000|TR0|with dynastic ambitions for their 
20110131035704.000|20110131035706.000|TR0|families, an incredible access to the 
20110131035706.000|20110131035709.000|TR0|treasures of the land, and a kind of 
20110131035709.000|20110131035711.000|TR0|cruelty toward the people. And I think the 
20110131035711.000|20110131035714.000|TR0|discrepancy between these young 
20110131035714.000|20110131035716.000|TR0|sophisticated people in the streets and 
20110131035716.000|20110131035719.000|TR0|these old autocrats, we are seeing a 
20110131035719.000|20110131035721.000|TR0|crisis of the civilization in front of us.
20110131035721.000|20110131035724.000|TR0|
20110131035724.000|20110131035726.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Fouad Ajami knows a lot about 
20110131035726.000|20110131035728.000|TR0|the Middle East for disclosure.  He was my 
20110131035728.000|20110131035731.000|TR0|professor of Middle East Studies at Johns 
20110131035731.000|20110131035733.000|TR0|Hopkins University.  Professor, thanks so 
20110131035733.000|20110131035736.000|TR0|much.  We always learn from you and we 
20110131035736.000|20110131035738.000|TR0|hope to be learning for many, many more 
20110131035738.000|20110131035741.000|TR0|years.  Thanks very much for coming.
20110131035741.000|20110131035743.000|TR0|
20110131035743.000|20110131035746.000|TR0|AJAMI:  Thank you very much, Wolf.
20110131035746.000|20110131035748.000|TR0|
20110131035748.000|20110131035751.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Let's go back to Anderson.
20110131035751.000|20110131035753.000|TR0|
20110131035753.000|20110131035755.000|TR0|Anderson, you've been there now, what -- 
20110131035755.000|20110131035758.000|TR0|only a few hours, but give us your biggest 
20110131035758.000|20110131035800.000|TR0|impression.
20110131035800.000|20110131035803.000|TR0|
20110131035803.000|20110131035805.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes.  We flew in this morning.  
20110131035805.000|20110131035808.000|TR0|And it was interesting just flying in, 
20110131035808.000|20110131035810.000|TR0|obviously the airport is congested with 
20110131035810.000|20110131035813.000|TR0|people trying to get out.  It's a little 
20110131035813.000|20110131035815.000|TR0|surreal to me coming into the place that 
20110131035815.000|20110131035818.000|TR0|everyone is trying to leave from.  It's 
20110131035818.000|20110131035820.000|TR0|sort of -- I guess we're all pretty used 
20110131035820.000|20110131035823.000|TR0|to it here at CNN though.
20110131035823.000|20110131035825.000|TR0|
20110131035825.000|20110131035827.000|TR0|But I talked to an American couple there 
20110131035827.000|20110131035830.000|TR0|who had been stuck for 48 hours.  They 
20110131035830.000|20110131035832.000|TR0|were trying to get a flight to India.  
20110131035832.000|20110131035835.000|TR0|Finally, they just gave up.  They were 
20110131035835.000|20110131035837.000|TR0|trying to -- decided to just go back into 
20110131035837.000|20110131035840.000|TR0|the city of Cairo.  Not sure what they are 
20110131035840.000|20110131035842.000|TR0|going to do or how they are going to get 
20110131035842.000|20110131035845.000|TR0|out.
20110131035845.000|20110131035847.000|TR0|
20110131035847.000|20110131035850.000|TR0|We now know the U.S. is going to start 
20110131035850.000|20110131035852.000|TR0|voluntary evacuations of American citizens 
20110131035852.000|20110131035854.000|TR0|on this day, on Monday, but again the 
20110131035854.000|20110131035857.000|TR0|organization is unclear.  And it's really 
20110131035857.000|20110131035859.000|TR0|unclear, Wolf, what's going to happen over 
20110131035859.000|20110131035902.000|TR0|the next couple of hours.  Really, as Ben 
20110131035902.000|20110131035904.000|TR0|Wedeman said earlier, this is happening so 
20110131035904.000|20110131035907.000|TR0|fast, no one can really predict, Wolf.
20110131035907.000|20110131035909.000|TR0|
20110131035909.000|20110131035912.000|TR0|BLITZER:  It's really going to be fluid 
20110131035912.000|20110131035914.000|TR0|and we're going to watch it every step of 
20110131035914.000|20110131035917.000|TR0|the way.
20110131035917.000|20110131035919.000|TR0|
20110131035919.000|20110131035921.000|TR0|Anderson, thanks so much.
20110131035921.000|20110131035924.000|TR0|
