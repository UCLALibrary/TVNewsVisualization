20110131141349.000|20110131141349.000|CC1|TAHRIR SQUARE.                  
20110131141349.000|20110131141351.000|CC1|WHAT ARE YOU SEEING AND HEARING?
20110131141351.000|20110131141353.000|CC1|>> I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE       
20110131141353.000|20110131141358.000|CC1|BECOMING LESS AFRAID.           
20110131141358.000|20110131141359.000|CC1|THERE WAS LESS SHOOTING TODAY   
20110131141359.000|20110131141400.000|CC1|AND YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WENT       
20110131141400.000|20110131141403.000|CC1|YESTERDAY AND CAME BACK AND SO, 
20110131141403.000|20110131141405.000|CC1|I THINK IT'S GATHERING MOMENTUM.
20110131141405.000|20110131141407.000|CC1|I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, EITHER   
20110131141407.000|20110131141411.000|CC1|MUBARAK MANAGES TO CRUSH IT     
20110131141411.000|20110131141412.000|CC1|VIOLENTLY, EITHER THERE'S A     
20110131141412.000|20110131141414.000|CC1|TIANANMEN SQUARE OR HE'S OUT.   
20110131141414.000|20110131141416.000|CC1|HE JUST CANNOT SURVIVE A        
20110131141416.000|20110131141418.000|CC1|SNOWBALLING MOVEMENT.           
20110131141418.000|20110131141420.000|CC1|>> NOW, DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE 
20110131141420.000|20110131141422.000|CC1|BETWEEN THE ARMY AND STATE      
20110131141422.000|20110131141424.000|CC1|POLICE AND HOW THEY'RE BOTH     
20110131141424.000|20110131141428.000|CC1|HANDLING THE PROTESTERS.        
20110131141428.000|20110131141429.000|CC1|>> WELL, THE POLICE ARE REALLY  
20110131141429.000|20110131141431.000|CC1|WIDELY AIDED BOTH BECAUSE OF    
20110131141431.000|20110131141432.000|CC1|THEIR OPPRESSION AND THE WAY    
20110131141432.000|20110131141437.000|CC1|THEY HANDLED THE DEMONSTRATIONS 
20110131141437.000|20110131141437.000|CC1|INITIALLY.                      
20110131141437.000|20110131141438.000|CC1|AND ALSO, JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE 
20110131141438.000|20110131141440.000|CC1|A FORCE THE PEOPLE HAVE A DAILY 
20110131141440.000|20110131141442.000|CC1|INTERACTION WITH AND ARE NOT    
20110131141442.000|20110131141442.000|CC1|HAPPY WITH.                     
20110131141442.000|20110131141446.000|CC1|THE MILITARY IS AN INSTITUTION  
20110131141446.000|20110131141447.000|CC1|THAT IS PRETTY EFFICIENT AND    
20110131141447.000|20110131141449.000|CC1|THAT IS WIDELY RESPECTED AND IT 
20110131141449.000|20110131141451.000|CC1|HAS BEEN QUITE FRIENDLY, THE    
20110131141451.000|20110131141455.000|CC1|SOLDIERS ON TAHRIR SQUARE HAVE  
20110131141455.000|20110131141458.000|CC1|THEIR PHOTOS TAKEN WITH PEOPLE, 
20110131141458.000|20110131141502.000|CC1|THEY LET GRAFFITI IN SOME CASES 
20110131141502.000|20110131141503.000|CC1|BE PAINTED ON THEIR TANKS.      
20110131141503.000|20110131141504.000|CC1|THEY INSIST THAT THERE IS NO WAY
20110131141504.000|20110131141506.000|CC1|THE SOLDIERS WOULD OPEN FIRE.   
20110131141506.000|20110131141509.000|CC1|ON THE OTHER HAND, I REMEMBER   
20110131141509.000|20110131141512.000|CC1|THE SAME THING IN TIANANMEN     
20110131141512.000|20110131141513.000|CC1|SQUARE AND PEOPLE IN INDONESIA  
20110131141513.000|20110131141515.000|CC1|SAYING THE SAME THING IN 1997   
20110131141515.000|20110131141516.000|CC1|AND SO ON.                      
20110131141516.000|20110131141518.000|CC1|IT'S A REFRAIN ONE DOES HERE    
20110131141518.000|20110131141521.000|CC1|UNTIL SOLDIERS DO OPEN FIRE.    
20110131141521.000|20110131141523.000|CC1|>> AND OBVIOUSLY, THE           
20110131141523.000|20110131141525.000|CC1|DEMONSTRATORS ARE NOT           
20110131141525.000|20110131141527.000|CC1|MONOLITHIC, BUT A LOT HAS BEEN  
20110131141527.000|20110131141529.000|CC1|WRITTEN ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE     
20110131141529.000|20110131141531.000|CC1|COMING FROM POLITICALLY.        
20110131141531.000|20110131141534.000|CC1|THEY'RE NOT ENAMORED WITH THE   
20110131141534.000|20110131141535.000|CC1|MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.             
20110131141535.000|20110131141536.000|CC1|IS THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE IN      
20110131141536.000|20110131141536.000|CC1|TALKING TO PEOPLE?              
20110131141536.000|20110131141542.000|CC1|>> I THINK THE PEOPLE IN TAHRIR 
20110131141542.000|20110131141543.000|CC1|SQUARE ARE PRETTY SAVVY AND THEY
20110131141543.000|20110131141544.000|CC1|KNOW THAT AMERICANS ARE         
20110131141544.000|20110131141546.000|CC1|CONCERNED ABOUT PRECISELY THAT  
20110131141546.000|20110131141548.000|CC1|ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S NATURAL  
20110131141548.000|20110131141550.000|CC1|FOR THEM TO TELL US TO SOME     
20110131141550.000|20110131141551.000|CC1|DEGREE WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR AND 
20110131141551.000|20110131141553.000|CC1|THEY MAKE THAT POINT THAT YES,  
20110131141553.000|20110131141554.000|CC1|THERE ARE SOME MUSLIM           
20110131141554.000|20110131141558.000|CC1|BROTHERHOOD PEOPLE ON THE       
20110131141558.000|20110131141559.000|CC1|SQUARE, BUT THERE ARE MINORITIES
20110131141559.000|20110131141601.000|CC1|THAT MOST EGYPTIANS ARE SECULAR 
20110131141601.000|20110131141602.000|CC1|AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE
20110131141602.000|20110131141604.000|CC1|IS A LOT OF PROOF TO THAT.      
20110131141604.000|20110131141605.000|CC1|BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE I THINK THAT 
20110131141605.000|20110131141609.000|CC1|THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO TAHRIR     
20110131141609.000|20110131141611.000|CC1|SQUARE TEND TO BE MORE          
20110131141611.000|20110131141614.000|CC1|URBANIZED, MORE SECULAR THAN    
20110131141614.000|20110131141616.000|CC1|YOUR AVERAGE VILLAGER IN THE    
20110131141616.000|20110131141617.000|CC1|COUNTRY SIDE.                   
20110131141617.000|20110131141621.000|CC1|>> MUBARAK'S THE ULTIMATE       
20110131141621.000|20110131141622.000|CC1|PRAGMATIST WHEN IT CAME TO      
20110131141622.000|20110131141623.000|CC1|ISRAEL, RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE  
20110131141623.000|20110131141624.000|CC1|UNITED STATES.                  
20110131141624.000|20110131141626.000|CC1|IS THAT PRAGMATIC STREAK AT ALL 
20110131141626.000|20110131141628.000|CC1|DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO KICK IN
20110131141628.000|20110131141629.000|CC1|WITH HIM PERSONALLY OVER THE    
20110131141629.000|20110131141632.000|CC1|NEXT WEEK?                      
20110131141632.000|20110131141634.000|CC1|>> WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S A       
20110131141634.000|20110131141637.000|CC1|PRAGMATIST, TRUE, BUT HE'S ALSO 
20110131141637.000|20110131141640.000|CC1|PRETTY STUBBORN AND I THINK THAT
20110131141640.000|20110131141642.000|CC1|YOU KNOW, HE WOULD DESPERATELY  
20110131141642.000|20110131141645.000|CC1|LIKE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY 
20110131141645.000|20110131141647.000|CC1|OF STAYING ON.                  
20110131141647.000|20110131141650.000|CC1|AS I SAID, SEEMS TO ME THAT     
20110131141650.000|20110131141652.000|CC1|UNLESS THERE IS SOME KIND OF A  
20110131141652.000|20110131141653.000|CC1|VIOLENT CRACKDOWN, THERE'S JUST 
20110131141653.000|20110131141655.000|CC1|NO WAY.                         
20110131141655.000|20110131141659.000|CC1|THESE PROTESTS WILL GROW.       
20110131141659.000|20110131141702.000|CC1|EGYPT WILL BE PARALYZED AND HE  
20110131141702.000|20110131141703.000|CC1|WILL BE PUSHED OUT.             
20110131141703.000|20110131141703.000|CC1|SO THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES    
20110131141703.000|20110131141704.000|CC1|DOES HE THEN ORDER THE MILITARY 
20110131141704.000|20110131141706.000|CC1|TO USE VIOLENT FORCE AND IF HE  
20110131141706.000|20110131141709.000|CC1|DOES, DOES THE MILITARY GO AHEAD
20110131141709.000|20110131141710.000|CC1|AND DO THAT?                    
20110131141710.000|20110131141712.000|CC1|NEITHER IS CERTAIN, BUT IT SEEMS
20110131141712.000|20110131141718.000|CC1|TO ME THAT BOTH ARE POSSIBLE.

20110131145752.000|20110131145755.000|CC1|  COPD makes it hard to breathe 
20110131145755.000|20110131145755.000|CC1|   so I wasn't playing much of  
20110131145755.000|20110131145758.000|CC1|     a role in my own life.

20110131145758.000|20110131145800.000|CC1|      I'm breathing better.

20110131145805.000|20110131145806.000|CC1|   ADVAIR is clinically proven

20110131145806.000|20110131145809.000|CC1|         lung function.         
20110131145809.000|20110131145811.000|CC1|  Unlike most COPD medications, 
20110131145811.000|20110131145811.000|CC1|         ADVAIR contains

20110131145819.000|20110131145819.000|CC1|      ADVAIR won't replace

20110131145827.000|20110131145827.000|CC1|        may have a higher

20110131145830.000|20110131145830.000|CC1|    ADVAIR may increase your
