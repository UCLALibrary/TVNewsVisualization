20110131010012.000|20110131010014.000|TR0|DREW GRIFFIN, HOST (voice-over):  It 
20110131010014.000|20110131010017.000|TR0|happened in the dark of night. Greg Taylor 
20110131010017.000|20110131010019.000|TR0|made a wrong turn down a dead end road.  
20110131010019.000|20110131010022.000|TR0|It would end up costing him 17 years in 
20110131010022.000|20110131010025.000|TR0|prison.
20110131010025.000|20110131010027.000|TR0|
20110131010027.000|20110131010030.000|TR0|GREG TAYLOR, FORMER PRISON INMATE:  
20110131010030.000|20110131010032.000|TR0|There's no way I could have committed that 
20110131010032.000|20110131010035.000|TR0|crime.
20110131010035.000|20110131010037.000|TR0|
20110131010037.000|20110131010040.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  A state bureau of investigation 
20110131010040.000|20110131010043.000|TR0|crime lab withheld evidence that could 
20110131010043.000|20110131010045.000|TR0|have set him free.
20110131010045.000|20110131010048.000|TR0|
20110131010048.000|20110131010050.000|TR0|FLOYD BROWN, FORMER PRISON INMATE:  I 
20110131010050.000|20110131010053.000|TR0|ain't murder nobody.
20110131010053.000|20110131010055.000|TR0|
20110131010055.000|20110131010058.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Floyd Brown spent 14 years 
20110131010058.000|20110131010101.000|TR0|locked up for a crime he didn't commit.
20110131010101.000|20110131010103.000|TR0|
20110131010103.000|20110131010106.000|TR0|(On camera):  Was there any evidence 
20110131010106.000|20110131010108.000|TR0|whatsoever linking him to the crime?
20110131010108.000|20110131010111.000|TR0|
20110131010111.000|20110131010113.000|TR0|MIKE KLINKOSUM, FLOYD BROWN'S ATTORNEY:  
20110131010113.000|20110131010116.000|TR0|No.  The only thing that puts Floyd in 
20110131010116.000|20110131010119.000|TR0|this case at all is the fictional 
20110131010119.000|20110131010121.000|TR0|confession.
20110131010121.000|20110131010124.000|TR0|
20110131010124.000|20110131010126.000|TR0|DAVID RUDOLPH, ATTORNEY:  I think over the 
20110131010126.000|20110131010129.000|TR0|last 20 years a culture has developed at 
20110131010129.000|20110131010131.000|TR0|the SBI that basically the ends justify 
20110131010131.000|20110131010134.000|TR0|the means.
20110131010134.000|20110131010137.000|TR0|
20110131010137.000|20110131010139.000|TR0|MANDY LOCKE, REPORTER, THE NEWS AND 
20110131010139.000|20110131010142.000|TR0|OBSERVER OF RALEIGH:  You'd hoped that 
20110131010142.000|20110131010144.000|TR0|these were isolated incidents.  The more 
20110131010144.000|20110131010147.000|TR0|we dug, the more we found that that wasn't 
20110131010147.000|20110131010149.000|TR0|the case.
20110131010149.000|20110131010152.000|TR0|
20110131010152.000|20110131010155.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  You know you never anticipate 
20110131010155.000|20110131010157.000|TR0|anything like this.  You always think that 
20110131010157.000|20110131010200.000|TR0|there's a sense of justice in the world 
20110131010200.000|20110131010202.000|TR0|and that the system works.
20110131010202.000|20110131010205.000|TR0|
20110131010205.000|20110131010207.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  It was September 
20110131010207.000|20110131010210.000|TR0|25th, 1991, in Raleigh, North Carolina, 
20110131010210.000|20110131010213.000|TR0|and Greg Taylor was spiraling down a 
20110131010213.000|20110131010215.000|TR0|destructive path.  A husband and devoted 
20110131010215.000|20110131010218.000|TR0|father with a steady job, he was fighting 
20110131010218.000|20110131010220.000|TR0|a losing battle with crack cocaine.
20110131010220.000|20110131010223.000|TR0|
20110131010223.000|20110131010225.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  I think those two days that kind 
20110131010225.000|20110131010228.000|TR0|of sum it up which was the day before I 
20110131010228.000|20110131010231.000|TR0|was arrested I went to the PTA meeting at 
20110131010231.000|20110131010233.000|TR0|my daughter's school.  Then the next night 
20110131010233.000|20110131010236.000|TR0|I went out partying.
20110131010236.000|20110131010238.000|TR0|
20110131010238.000|20110131010241.000|TR0|BECKY TAYLOR, GREG TAYLOR'S FORMER WIFE:  
20110131010241.000|20110131010243.000|TR0|I met Greg in high school, dated through 
20110131010243.000|20110131010246.000|TR0|college and had got married.
20110131010246.000|20110131010249.000|TR0|
20110131010249.000|20110131010251.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Becky Taylor says their marriage 
20110131010251.000|20110131010254.000|TR0|was on the rocks.
20110131010254.000|20110131010256.000|TR0|
20110131010256.000|20110131010259.000|TR0|B. TAYLOR:  I tried to break up with him 
20110131010259.000|20110131010301.000|TR0|like every three months.  And then he 
20110131010301.000|20110131010304.000|TR0|would get better and then we'd go through 
20110131010304.000|20110131010307.000|TR0|that cycle for years.
20110131010307.000|20110131010309.000|TR0|
20110131010309.000|20110131010312.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  That night the addiction would 
20110131010312.000|20110131010314.000|TR0|get the better of him.  He was watching a 
20110131010314.000|20110131010317.000|TR0|ball game with friends.
20110131010317.000|20110131010319.000|TR0|
20110131010319.000|20110131010322.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  When that baseball game went into 
20110131010322.000|20110131010325.000|TR0|extra innings, something clicked.  I could 
20110131010325.000|20110131010327.000|TR0|go get a couple of rocks and that was all 
20110131010327.000|20110131010330.000|TR0|it took.
20110131010330.000|20110131010332.000|TR0|
20110131010332.000|20110131010335.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  As the game went into extra 
20110131010335.000|20110131010338.000|TR0|innings, Greg hit the street in pursuit of 
20110131010338.000|20110131010340.000|TR0|his next fix.  He found a local dealer.  
20110131010340.000|20110131010343.000|TR0|Johnny Beck.
20110131010343.000|20110131010345.000|TR0|
20110131010345.000|20110131010348.000|TR0|JOHNNY BECK, GREG TAYLOR'S FRIEND:  Greg 
20110131010348.000|20110131010350.000|TR0|picked me up.  I showed him what I had.  
20110131010350.000|20110131010353.000|TR0|And we hung out all night, coming.  
20110131010353.000|20110131010356.000|TR0|Buying.  Buying drugs.  You know, and 
20110131010356.000|20110131010358.000|TR0|stopping getting beer.
20110131010358.000|20110131010401.000|TR0|
20110131010401.000|20110131010403.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  We ended up coming down here.  We 
20110131010403.000|20110131010406.000|TR0|could see that it was dark, it was 
20110131010406.000|20110131010408.000|TR0|secluded and it looked like a pretty good 
20110131010408.000|20110131010411.000|TR0|place to -- you know to stop and get high.
20110131010411.000|20110131010414.000|TR0|
20110131010414.000|20110131010416.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Greg and Johnny Beck spent an 
20110131010416.000|20110131010419.000|TR0|hour getting high in a cul-de- sac.  At 
20110131010419.000|20110131010421.000|TR0|the end of a dirt road.  Then Greg made a 
20110131010421.000|20110131010424.000|TR0|move that would change his life.
20110131010424.000|20110131010426.000|TR0|
20110131010426.000|20110131010429.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  The urge kind of had hit me to 
20110131010429.000|20110131010432.000|TR0|spin around in the mud a little bit on the 
20110131010432.000|20110131010434.000|TR0|way out.  I basically went across the 
20110131010434.000|20110131010437.000|TR0|path.  I might have made it 10 feet before 
20110131010437.000|20110131010439.000|TR0|I bottomed out in a ditch.
20110131010439.000|20110131010442.000|TR0|
20110131010442.000|20110131010444.000|TR0|BECK:  So the truck stopped.  We tried 
20110131010444.000|20110131010447.000|TR0|everything we can to get the truck out.  
20110131010447.000|20110131010450.000|TR0|The truck don't budge.
20110131010450.000|20110131010452.000|TR0|
20110131010452.000|20110131010455.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  It was just almost a relief, you 
20110131010455.000|20110131010457.000|TR0|know, that that truck was stuck, because I 
20110131010457.000|20110131010500.000|TR0|kind of took it as a sign that I don't 
20110131010500.000|20110131010502.000|TR0|need to be driving anymore that night.  
20110131010502.000|20110131010505.000|TR0|So, you know, we just took off walking.
20110131010505.000|20110131010508.000|TR0|
20110131010508.000|20110131010510.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  As they walked back through the 
20110131010510.000|20110131010513.000|TR0|cul-de-sac, they saw what Greg thought was 
20110131010513.000|20110131010515.000|TR0|a roll of carpet.
20110131010515.000|20110131010518.000|TR0|
20110131010518.000|20110131010520.000|TR0|BECK:  I thought it was a mannequin laying 
20110131010520.000|20110131010523.000|TR0|there.
20110131010523.000|20110131010526.000|TR0|
20110131010526.000|20110131010528.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  But I didn't think it was any 
20110131010528.000|20110131010531.000|TR0|mannequin.  I looked back over my shoulder 
20110131010531.000|20110131010533.000|TR0|again.  And this time what caught my eye 
20110131010533.000|20110131010536.000|TR0|was a hand. Said, I think that's a body, 
20110131010536.000|20110131010538.000|TR0|you know, it might even be dead.
20110131010538.000|20110131010541.000|TR0|
20110131010541.000|20110131010544.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Greg was right.  It was the body 
20110131010544.000|20110131010546.000|TR0|of Jacquetta Thomas, a prostitute.  The 
20110131010546.000|20110131010549.000|TR0|two men had stumbled across a gruesome 
20110131010549.000|20110131010551.000|TR0|murder scene. Greg Taylor wanted to call 
20110131010551.000|20110131010554.000|TR0|the police, but Johnny Beck thought that 
20110131010554.000|20110131010556.000|TR0|was just asking for trouble.
20110131010556.000|20110131010559.000|TR0|
20110131010559.000|20110131010602.000|TR0|BECK:  I said, knowing our PD, first thing 
20110131010602.000|20110131010604.000|TR0|they're going to do is accuse us.
20110131010604.000|20110131010607.000|TR0|
20110131010607.000|20110131010609.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  We had drugs on our person.  I 
20110131010609.000|20110131010612.000|TR0|was driving without a license. Had been 
20110131010612.000|20110131010614.000|TR0|consuming alcohol.  You know, so there is 
20110131010614.000|20110131010617.000|TR0|a litany of reasons that I would not want 
20110131010617.000|20110131010620.000|TR0|to talk to the police in general.
20110131010620.000|20110131010622.000|TR0|
20110131010622.000|20110131010625.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  They walked out to the main road 
20110131010625.000|20110131010627.000|TR0|and eventually Greg called his wife.
20110131010627.000|20110131010630.000|TR0|
20110131010630.000|20110131010632.000|TR0|B. TAYLOR:  So I got a call at 6:00.  I 
20110131010632.000|20110131010635.000|TR0|was kind of surprised that he hadn't made 
20110131010635.000|20110131010638.000|TR0|it home.  And he said he'd gotten his 
20110131010638.000|20110131010640.000|TR0|truck stuck and needed me to pick him up, 
20110131010640.000|20110131010643.000|TR0|or he said he just wanted to check on the 
20110131010643.000|20110131010645.000|TR0|truck, and make sure it was still there.
20110131010645.000|20110131010648.000|TR0|
20110131010648.000|20110131010651.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  The truck was there, and so were 
20110131010651.000|20110131010653.000|TR0|the police.
20110131010653.000|20110131010656.000|TR0|
20110131010656.000|20110131010658.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  We pulled up, my wife and I, and 
20110131010658.000|20110131010701.000|TR0|there were, you know, police cars 
20110131010701.000|20110131010703.000|TR0|everywhere.  And I guess the realization 
20110131010703.000|20110131010706.000|TR0|hit me then, it's like oh, yes, we did see 
20110131010706.000|20110131010709.000|TR0|a body down there.
20110131010709.000|20110131010711.000|TR0|
20110131010711.000|20110131010714.000|TR0|B. TAYLOR:  Once he saw the police and saw 
20110131010714.000|20110131010716.000|TR0|that his truck was still there, he 
20110131010716.000|20110131010719.000|TR0|realized sooner or later they're going to 
20110131010719.000|20110131010721.000|TR0|find out it's his truck and come looking 
20110131010721.000|20110131010724.000|TR0|for him so he might as well go talk to 
20110131010724.000|20110131010727.000|TR0|them about anything he saw that could 
20110131010727.000|20110131010729.000|TR0|possibly help.  Still never occurred to 
20110131010729.000|20110131010732.000|TR0|him that they might be looking at him.
20110131010732.000|20110131010734.000|TR0|
20110131010734.000|20110131010737.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Jacquetta Thomas was brutally 
20110131010737.000|20110131010739.000|TR0|beaten, covered in blood.
20110131010739.000|20110131010742.000|TR0|
20110131010742.000|20110131010745.000|TR0|B. TAYLOR:  We've answered every question 
20110131010745.000|20110131010747.000|TR0|the police had and gave them everything 
20110131010747.000|20110131010750.000|TR0|they wanted.  Because, you know there 
20110131010750.000|20110131010752.000|TR0|really wasn't that much.  We could tell, 
20110131010752.000|20110131010755.000|TR0|you know, there's certainly nothing to 
20110131010755.000|20110131010757.000|TR0|hide.
20110131010757.000|20110131010800.000|TR0|
20110131010800.000|20110131010803.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Thinking he had nothing to worry 
20110131010803.000|20110131010805.000|TR0|about, Greg offered hair samples and the 
20110131010805.000|20110131010808.000|TR0|clothing he wore the night before.  He 
20110131010808.000|20110131010810.000|TR0|even said he'd take a polygraph.
20110131010810.000|20110131010813.000|TR0|
20110131010813.000|20110131010815.000|TR0|(On camera):  When in that questioning 
20110131010815.000|20110131010818.000|TR0|which became an interrogation did you 
20110131010818.000|20110131010821.000|TR0|realize, hey, wait a minute, I just came 
20110131010821.000|20110131010823.000|TR0|in here to get my truck.  And they're 
20110131010823.000|20110131010826.000|TR0|looking at me as being involved with that 
20110131010826.000|20110131010828.000|TR0|body.
20110131010828.000|20110131010831.000|TR0|
20110131010831.000|20110131010833.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  Basically he says, I have a 
20110131010833.000|20110131010836.000|TR0|choice whether I want to be a defendant or 
20110131010836.000|20110131010839.000|TR0|a witness.  And to me, that wasn't much of 
20110131010839.000|20110131010841.000|TR0|a choice because I didn't do anything and 
20110131010841.000|20110131010844.000|TR0|I didn't see anything.
20110131010844.000|20110131010846.000|TR0|
20110131010846.000|20110131010849.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  And what were they asking of you?
20110131010849.000|20110131010851.000|TR0|
20110131010851.000|20110131010854.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  Essentially they were asking me 
20110131010854.000|20110131010857.000|TR0|to tell them my co-defendant committed the 
20110131010857.000|20110131010859.000|TR0|crime and they would go easy on me.
20110131010859.000|20110131010902.000|TR0|
20110131010902.000|20110131010904.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  According to 
20110131010904.000|20110131010907.000|TR0|Taylor, the Raleigh police wanted him to 
20110131010907.000|20110131010909.000|TR0|point the finger at Johnny Beck, a known 
20110131010909.000|20110131010912.000|TR0|drug dealer.  He refused.
20110131010912.000|20110131010915.000|TR0|
20110131010915.000|20110131010917.000|TR0|B. TAYLOR:  Sometime in the early evening 
20110131010917.000|20110131010920.000|TR0|Greg called and was just, like, hysterical 
20110131010920.000|20110131010922.000|TR0|saying that, you know, they were charging 
20110131010922.000|20110131010925.000|TR0|him.  And so it's just still unbelievable.
20110131010925.000|20110131010927.000|TR0|
20110131010927.000|20110131010930.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  The charges against Beck were 
20110131010930.000|20110131010933.000|TR0|eventually dropped, but Greg went to 
20110131010933.000|20110131010935.000|TR0|trial.  His mother and stepfather 
20110131010935.000|20110131010938.000|TR0|mortgaged their house to pay for his 
20110131010938.000|20110131010940.000|TR0|defense, but Greg's bad luck continued.  
20110131010940.000|20110131010943.000|TR0|The hotshot attorney they hired resigned 
20110131010943.000|20110131010945.000|TR0|from Greg's case three months before trial 
20110131010945.000|20110131010948.000|TR0|and was disbarred for fraud and 
20110131010948.000|20110131010951.000|TR0|embezzlement, leaving little time for his 
20110131010951.000|20110131010953.000|TR0|new lawyer to prepare.
20110131010953.000|20110131010956.000|TR0|
20110131010956.000|20110131010958.000|TR0|B. TAYLOR:  She said this was the weakest 
20110131010958.000|20110131011001.000|TR0|case he had ever seen in his entire 
20110131011001.000|20110131011003.000|TR0|career.  He was really confident that they 
20110131011003.000|20110131011006.000|TR0|could get it dismissed and so he wasn't 
20110131011006.000|20110131011009.000|TR0|going to present any evidence.

20110131011016.000|20110131011019.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  But the prosecution presented 
20110131011019.000|20110131011022.000|TR0|overwhelming evidence, an eyewitness who 
20110131011022.000|20110131011024.000|TR0|claims to have seen Taylor with the 
20110131011024.000|20110131011027.000|TR0|victim, a dog that picked up the victim's 
20110131011027.000|20110131011029.000|TR0|scent in Taylor's truck.  A jailhouse 
20110131011029.000|20110131011032.000|TR0|snitch who testified that Taylor 
20110131011032.000|20110131011034.000|TR0|confessed.  But perhaps most convincing of 
20110131011034.000|20110131011037.000|TR0|all, scientific evidence showing blood on 
20110131011037.000|20110131011040.000|TR0|Taylor's truck.  It took the jury just two 
20110131011040.000|20110131011042.000|TR0|hours to convict.

20110131011052.000|20110131011055.000|TR0|was -- you know it was definitely a shock.

20110131011058.000|20110131011100.000|TR0|B. TAYLOR:  It was a minimum 20 years with

20110131011131.000|20110131011134.000|TR0|Taylor sat in prison for a murder he 
20110131011134.000|20110131011136.000|TR0|consistently claimed he didn't commit.  
20110131011136.000|20110131011139.000|TR0|For much of that time, he slept here, on

20110131011144.000|20110131011146.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  In the beginning, there was 
20110131011146.000|20110131011149.000|TR0|almost a constant hope.  Then there was 
20110131011149.000|20110131011152.000|TR0|that periodic hope, then there was no hope.

20110131011210.000|20110131011212.000|TR0|of funny that even though I had to be 
20110131011212.000|20110131011215.000|TR0|dependent on the present to survive, at 
20110131011215.000|20110131011217.000|TR0|the same time you wanted to tune it out

20110131011235.000|20110131011238.000|TR0|earned all these degrees and I spent, you 
20110131011238.000|20110131011240.000|TR0|know, all this time studying computers and 
20110131011240.000|20110131011243.000|TR0|electronics and telecommunications and 
20110131011243.000|20110131011246.000|TR0|networking.  And I felt like, OK, if this

20110131011319.000|20110131011322.000|TR0|birthday.  And that first Christmas.  I 
20110131011322.000|20110131011324.000|TR0|can remember thinking when she was 16, you 
20110131011324.000|20110131011327.000|TR0|know that she's driving now.  And I have 
20110131011327.000|20110131011329.000|TR0|to worry about her being on the roads and 
20110131011329.000|20110131011332.000|TR0|whatnot.
20110131011332.000|20110131011335.000|TR0|
20110131011335.000|20110131011337.000|TR0|And when she graduated high school -- and 
20110131011337.000|20110131011340.000|TR0|you just want so much to get out before 
20110131011340.000|20110131011342.000|TR0|the next one but you're sitting there and 
20110131011342.000|20110131011345.000|TR0|you're helpless.

20110131011347.000|20110131011350.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Greg repeatedly appealed his 
20110131011350.000|20110131011353.000|TR0|conviction, going all the way to the 
20110131011353.000|20110131011355.000|TR0|Supreme Court.
20110131011355.000|20110131011358.000|TR0|
20110131011358.000|20110131011400.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  OK.  After my U.S. Supreme Court 
20110131011400.000|20110131011403.000|TR0|appeal was denied, we started pursuing 
20110131011403.000|20110131011405.000|TR0|clemency and retained an attorney out of 
20110131011405.000|20110131011408.000|TR0|Greensboro for that.  The two things he 
20110131011408.000|20110131011411.000|TR0|did, one of them was he gave polygraph to 
20110131011411.000|20110131011413.000|TR0|my co-defendant and myself.  Another thing 
20110131011413.000|20110131011416.000|TR0|he did was file a motion for DNA testing.
20110131011416.000|20110131011418.000|TR0|
20110131011418.000|20110131011421.000|TR0|And of course that motion for DNA testing 
20110131011421.000|20110131011423.000|TR0|was denied and that effectively shut out 
20110131011423.000|20110131011426.000|TR0|any kind of avenues I had through the 
20110131011426.000|20110131011429.000|TR0|courts after that.

20110131011441.000|20110131011444.000|TR0|ACTUAL INNOCENCE:  We get, you know, 
20110131011444.000|20110131011447.000|TR0|750,000 claims a year.  We reject about 95 
20110131011447.000|20110131011449.000|TR0|percent of them.

20110131011452.000|20110131011454.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Mumma runs the North Carolina 
20110131011454.000|20110131011457.000|TR0|Center on Actual Innocence, a last resort 
20110131011457.000|20110131011459.000|TR0|for those who claim they've been wrongly 
20110131011459.000|20110131011502.000|TR0|convicted.
20110131011502.000|20110131011505.000|TR0|
20110131011505.000|20110131011507.000|TR0|MUMMA:  They write us a letter.  We send 
20110131011507.000|20110131011510.000|TR0|them a questionnaire and a release.  So if 
20110131011510.000|20110131011512.000|TR0|they're willing to take the trouble and 
20110131011512.000|20110131011515.000|TR0|I'm pretty sure anybody who's innocent 
20110131011515.000|20110131011517.000|TR0|will take the trouble to fill out that 
20110131011517.000|20110131011520.000|TR0|questionnaire.
20110131011520.000|20110131011523.000|TR0|
20110131011523.000|20110131011525.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Greg wrote her in another 
20110131011525.000|20110131011528.000|TR0|desperate attempt to clear his name.
20110131011528.000|20110131011530.000|TR0|
20110131011530.000|20110131011533.000|TR0|MUMMA:  I was given a summary of Greg's 
20110131011533.000|20110131011535.000|TR0|case that was written by Greg, in his own 
20110131011535.000|20110131011538.000|TR0|words.  And that was incredibly compelling.
20110131011538.000|20110131011541.000|TR0|
20110131011541.000|20110131011543.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (on camera):  Why?
20110131011543.000|20110131011546.000|TR0|
20110131011546.000|20110131011548.000|TR0|MUMMA:  Well, he was offered a plea.  They 
20110131011548.000|20110131011551.000|TR0|came to him and said, all we want is for 
20110131011551.000|20110131011553.000|TR0|you to give us Johnny Beck and you can go 
20110131011553.000|20110131011556.000|TR0|home.  I don't know of any co-defendants 
20110131011556.000|20110131011559.000|TR0|who wouldn't turn on each other if they 
20110131011559.000|20110131011601.000|TR0|were guilty and have sort of chance to go 
20110131011601.000|20110131011604.000|TR0|home.
20110131011604.000|20110131011606.000|TR0|
20110131011606.000|20110131011609.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Why didn't you do it?

20110131011611.000|20110131011614.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  Silly as it sounds, you know, 
20110131011614.000|20110131011617.000|TR0|what told them and the way I put it into 
20110131011617.000|20110131011619.000|TR0|words was that I can still look in the 
20110131011619.000|20110131011622.000|TR0|mirror and you're not taking that away, 
20110131011622.000|20110131011624.000|TR0|too.  You know?  I didn't have anything 
20110131011624.000|20110131011627.000|TR0|else left.  I had already lost my family, 
20110131011627.000|20110131011629.000|TR0|my job, my house.  My daughter. And what 
20110131011629.000|20110131011632.000|TR0|was lying going to get it back?

20110131011635.000|20110131011637.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  Chris Mumma spent 
20110131011637.000|20110131011640.000|TR0|two years investigating Greg's story.
20110131011640.000|20110131011642.000|TR0|
20110131011642.000|20110131011645.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  She's like the answer to my

20110131011648.000|20110131011650.000|TR0|into my life.  I mean I read 833 books in 
20110131011650.000|20110131011653.000|TR0|prison and a whole lot of it was crime 
20110131011653.000|20110131011655.000|TR0|fictions and you got an attorney that 
20110131011655.000|20110131011658.000|TR0|actually digs and does the work and gets 
20110131011658.000|20110131011700.000|TR0|it right.

20110131011703.000|20110131011706.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  She and her team reviewed 
20110131011706.000|20110131011708.000|TR0|documents and the main witness whose 
20110131011708.000|20110131011711.000|TR0|turned out to be less than reliable.  
20110131011711.000|20110131011713.000|TR0|Slowly the state's case unraveled.

20110131011716.000|20110131011718.000|TR0|MUMMA:  You had a jailhouse snitch who 
20110131011718.000|20110131011721.000|TR0|admits that he came forward because he was 
20110131011721.000|20110131011724.000|TR0|hoping to get help with his sentence.  You 
20110131011724.000|20110131011726.000|TR0|have a prostitute who had charges dropped. 
20110131011726.000|20110131011729.000|TR0| You have a dog that was never trained to 
20110131011729.000|20110131011731.000|TR0|do what they said it did.  No fingerprints 
20110131011731.000|20110131011734.000|TR0|from her in the truck.  No fibers on her 
20110131011734.000|20110131011736.000|TR0|from them or on them from her.
20110131011736.000|20110131011739.000|TR0|
20110131011739.000|20110131011742.000|TR0|No blood transfer whatsoever and this was 
20110131011742.000|20110131011744.000|TR0|a bloody scene.  This was -- you know 
20110131011744.000|20110131011747.000|TR0|there was splatter on the street.  And 
20110131011747.000|20110131011749.000|TR0|she's got bloody finger smears on her 
20110131011749.000|20110131011752.000|TR0|arms.  Somebody had blood on them when 
20110131011752.000|20110131011754.000|TR0|they touched her.  So the physical 
20110131011754.000|20110131011757.000|TR0|evidence, it defies science, it defies 
20110131011757.000|20110131011800.000|TR0|common sense.

20110131011807.000|20110131011810.000|TR0|made to get that truck stuck in the ditch, 
20110131011810.000|20110131011812.000|TR0|things that were out of my control, the 
20110131011812.000|20110131011815.000|TR0|tunnel vision on the police, the attorney 
20110131011815.000|20110131011818.000|TR0|I had that went to prison, the jury who 
20110131011818.000|20110131011820.000|TR0|decided there wasn't much to go on but yet 
20110131011820.000|20110131011823.000|TR0|convicted me anyway.

20110131011836.000|20110131011838.000|TR0|Innocence Inquiry Commission.  It was the

20110131011904.000|20110131011906.000|TR0|designed to work was to get around those 
20110131011906.000|20110131011909.000|TR0|procedural blocks, to get around those

20110131011919.000|20110131011922.000|TR0|getting her father back in her life.  He 
20110131011922.000|20110131011924.000|TR0|had missed her graduation, her wedding,

20110131011958.000|20110131012000.000|TR0|records, all the police records, 
20110131012000.000|20110131012003.000|TR0|everything that the defense never had 
20110131012003.000|20110131012006.000|TR0|access to.  And we couldn't get access to. 
20110131012006.000|20110131012008.000|TR0| They could order DNA testing that Greg 
20110131012008.000|20110131012011.000|TR0|was denied previously.  And they did all 
20110131012011.000|20110131012013.000|TR0|that.

20110131012016.000|20110131012019.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  The eight-member 
20110131012019.000|20110131012021.000|TR0|commission voted unanimously that there 
20110131012021.000|20110131012024.000|TR0|was sufficient evidence to prove Greg 
20110131012024.000|20110131012026.000|TR0|Taylor was actually innocent.
20110131012026.000|20110131012029.000|TR0|
20110131012029.000|20110131012031.000|TR0|MUMMA:  So that opened the door for Greg's 
20110131012031.000|20110131012034.000|TR0|case to get back in the courts.
20110131012034.000|20110131012037.000|TR0|
20110131012037.000|20110131012039.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  It meant Greg would have one 
20110131012039.000|20110131012042.000|TR0|last chance to clear his name.
20110131012042.000|20110131012044.000|TR0|
20110131012044.000|20110131012047.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  To the very essence of who you 
20110131012047.000|20110131012049.000|TR0|are, you just hate -- just absolutely hate 
20110131012049.000|20110131012052.000|TR0|being accused of something like this.

20110131012055.000|20110131012057.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  What he was about to find out 
20110131012057.000|20110131012100.000|TR0|would rock the justice system. Evidence 
20110131012100.000|20110131012102.000|TR0|that would have changed everything and had 
20110131012102.000|20110131012105.000|TR0|been buried for 17 years.

20110131012107.000|20110131012110.000|TR0|MUMMA:  We had Greg's innocence in our

20110131012131.000|20110131012133.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  In February, 2010, 
20110131012133.000|20110131012136.000|TR0|Greg Taylor walked into this courtroom 
20110131012136.000|20110131012138.000|TR0|after 17 years in prison.  It was his last 
20110131012138.000|20110131012141.000|TR0|chance to prove his innocence.
20110131012141.000|20110131012143.000|TR0|
20110131012143.000|20110131012146.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  You know, you get let down so 
20110131012146.000|20110131012149.000|TR0|many times in the courts that you just 
20110131012149.000|20110131012151.000|TR0|lose faith in the justice system -- but 
20110131012151.000|20110131012154.000|TR0|yet you still cling to the truth.  I had 
20110131012154.000|20110131012156.000|TR0|no clue, you know, as to how this hearing 
20110131012156.000|20110131012159.000|TR0|was going to turn out.

20110131012201.000|20110131012204.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Convicted of murder and 
20110131012204.000|20110131012207.000|TR0|sentenced to 20 years to life, Greg faced 
20110131012207.000|20110131012209.000|TR0|a three-judge panel empowered to set him 
20110131012209.000|20110131012212.000|TR0|free.  They would consider an unreliable 
20110131012212.000|20110131012214.000|TR0|eyewitness, an inaccurate jailhouse 
20110131012214.000|20110131012217.000|TR0|snitch, an improperly trained forensic 
20110131012217.000|20110131012219.000|TR0|dog.  But there was one more revelation to 
20110131012219.000|20110131012222.000|TR0|come.
20110131012222.000|20110131012225.000|TR0|
20110131012225.000|20110131012227.000|TR0|MUMMA:  We were actually working on a

20110131012230.000|20110131012232.000|TR0|trying to organize all the testimony into 
20110131012232.000|20110131012235.000|TR0|files and organize statements by witness 
20110131012235.000|20110131012237.000|TR0|and things like that.

20110131012240.000|20110131012243.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Chris Mumma, director of the 
20110131012243.000|20110131012245.000|TR0|North Carolina Center on Actual Innocence, 
20110131012245.000|20110131012248.000|TR0|was one of Taylor's attorneys preparing 
20110131012248.000|20110131012250.000|TR0|for the panel she made a stunning 
20110131012250.000|20110131012253.000|TR0|discovery.  A file that had never made it 
20110131012253.000|20110131012255.000|TR0|to trial from the State Bureau of 
20110131012255.000|20110131012258.000|TR0|Investigation, or SBI's crime lab.
20110131012258.000|20110131012301.000|TR0|
20110131012301.000|20110131012303.000|TR0|MUMMA:  We had been there for a good part 
20110131012303.000|20110131012306.000|TR0|of the day going through everything and 
20110131012306.000|20110131012308.000|TR0|found the bench notes.
20110131012308.000|20110131012311.000|TR0|
20110131012311.000|20110131012313.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (on camera):  What are bench notes?
20110131012313.000|20110131012316.000|TR0|
20110131012316.000|20110131012319.000|TR0|MUMMA:  Bench notes are the back-up notes 
20110131012319.000|20110131012321.000|TR0|that go with that final report that's 
20110131012321.000|20110131012324.000|TR0|issued by the lab.  So it's all the actual 
20110131012324.000|20110131012326.000|TR0|test results and what the analyst is 
20110131012326.000|20110131012329.000|TR0|writing down as they're actually doing the 
20110131012329.000|20110131012332.000|TR0|testing before it goes into a nice type 
20110131012332.000|20110131012334.000|TR0|written report.
20110131012334.000|20110131012337.000|TR0|
20110131012337.000|20110131012339.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  The nice type 
20110131012339.000|20110131012342.000|TR0|written report stated there were chemical 
20110131012342.000|20110131012344.000|TR0|indications for the presence of blood on 
20110131012344.000|20110131012347.000|TR0|Greg's truck.  Blood that jurors said was 
20110131012347.000|20110131012350.000|TR0|indisputable evidence of guilt.  But lying 
20110131012350.000|20110131012352.000|TR0|in a box for the 17 years Greg was in 
20110131012352.000|20110131012355.000|TR0|prison was a test the SBI never shared, a 
20110131012355.000|20110131012357.000|TR0|more definitive test that showed the spot 
20110131012357.000|20110131012400.000|TR0|may not have been blood after all.  The 
20110131012400.000|20110131012402.000|TR0|jury never heard it.
20110131012402.000|20110131012405.000|TR0|
20110131012405.000|20110131012408.000|TR0|Chris Mumma now had the document that

20110131012413.000|20110131012415.000|TR0|MUMMA:  We had that they had 
20110131012415.000|20110131012418.000|TR0|misrepresented what was on that truck. We 
20110131012418.000|20110131012420.000|TR0|had Greg's innocence in our hands.

20110131012423.000|20110131012426.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (on camera):  At some point during

20110131012428.000|20110131012431.000|TR0|came to you and said guess what --

20110131012433.000|20110131012436.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  Guess what?  It wasn't blood.  
20110131012436.000|20110131012438.000|TR0|You know it still amazes me when I think 
20110131012438.000|20110131012441.000|TR0|about it, you know, because you just don't 
20110131012441.000|20110131012444.000|TR0|expect, you know, a lab to hide evidence.

20110131012446.000|20110131012449.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  During his original 
20110131012449.000|20110131012451.000|TR0|1993 trial, the prosecution referred to 
20110131012451.000|20110131012454.000|TR0|blood evidence over a dozen times.
20110131012454.000|20110131012456.000|TR0|
20110131012456.000|20110131012459.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  The reason why it kept me in 
20110131012459.000|20110131012502.000|TR0|prison so long is because, you know, the 
20110131012502.000|20110131012504.000|TR0|jury believed that that was the victim's 
20110131012504.000|20110131012507.000|TR0|blood on my truck. You know, the 
20110131012507.000|20110131012509.000|TR0|prosecutor argued that vehemently to the 
20110131012509.000|20110131012512.000|TR0|jury.  The jury bought it.  The jury 
20110131012512.000|20110131012514.000|TR0|convicted me.
20110131012514.000|20110131012517.000|TR0|
20110131012517.000|20110131012520.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Greg's legal team brought the 
20110131012520.000|20110131012522.000|TR0|new evidence before the judges.
20110131012522.000|20110131012525.000|TR0|
20110131012525.000|20110131012527.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  I'm sitting there in the

20110131012548.000|20110131012550.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  In a dramatic moment, Greg's 
20110131012550.000|20110131012553.000|TR0|lawyer asked the SBI agent responsible for 
20110131012553.000|20110131012556.000|TR0|the tests, Duane Deaver, to clarify his

20110131012601.000|20110131012603.000|TR0|DUANE DEAVER, FORMER SBI AGENT:  I can't 
20110131012603.000|20110131012606.000|TR0|say with scientific certainty that that 
20110131012606.000|20110131012608.000|TR0|was blood.
20110131012608.000|20110131012611.000|TR0|
20110131012611.000|20110131012614.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  But that conclusion was never

20110131012639.000|20110131012642.000|TR0|more shocking.  He said what he did was a 
20110131012642.000|20110131012645.000|TR0|sanctioned practice at the SBI.  In fact 
20110131012645.000|20110131012647.000|TR0|it would become written policy a few years 
20110131012647.000|20110131012650.000|TR0|later.

20110131012652.000|20110131012655.000|TR0|MUMMA:  You had an employee who was 
20110131012655.000|20110131012657.000|TR0|following policy.  Now do I think that 
20110131012657.000|20110131012700.000|TR0|employee should have had a conscience?  
20110131012700.000|20110131012703.000|TR0|Yes.  Do I think it should have bothered 
20110131012703.000|20110131012705.000|TR0|him that he wasn't reporting the full 
20110131012705.000|20110131012708.000|TR0|results? Yes.  In the end, is that 
20110131012708.000|20110131012710.000|TR0|ultimately where the responsibility should 
20110131012710.000|20110131012713.000|TR0|fall?  I don't think so.

20110131013326.000|20110131013329.000|TR0|And finally the truth has prevailed.

20110131013331.000|20110131013334.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  But Taylor's case got two of 
20110131013334.000|20110131013336.000|TR0|those reporters wondering.  How deep did 
20110131013336.000|20110131013339.000|TR0|the problems at the SBI go?

20110131013344.000|20110131013347.000|TR0|OF RALEIGH:  We've covered a lot of cases 
20110131013347.000|20110131013349.000|TR0|of prosecutorial or police misconduct and 
20110131013349.000|20110131013352.000|TR0|some of them involve the SBI agents.  And 
20110131013352.000|20110131013354.000|TR0|we've been saving string for years on this 
20110131013354.000|20110131013357.000|TR0|but what really got our attention focused 
20110131013357.000|20110131013359.000|TR0|on the SBI was the case of Greg Taylor.

20110131013402.000|20110131013405.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  "Raleigh News and Observer" 
20110131013405.000|20110131013407.000|TR0|reports Mandy Locke and Joe Neff reviewed 
20110131013407.000|20110131013410.000|TR0|more than 15,000 pages of documents.  In a 
20110131013410.000|20110131013412.000|TR0|month's long investigation of the SBI, 
20110131013412.000|20110131013415.000|TR0|they found SBI agents cut corners, bullied 
20110131013415.000|20110131013417.000|TR0|the vulnerable, and twisted reports and 
20110131013417.000|20110131013420.000|TR0|court testimony.
20110131013420.000|20110131013423.000|TR0|
20110131013423.000|20110131013425.000|TR0|LOCKE:  There was language in their 
20110131013425.000|20110131013428.000|TR0|reports that told lab analysts how to 
20110131013428.000|20110131013430.000|TR0|testify in court in a way that most us 
20110131013430.000|20110131013433.000|TR0|would agree favored the prosecution.  They 
20110131013433.000|20110131013435.000|TR0|were told that a good testimony would 
20110131013435.000|20110131013438.000|TR0|enhance their conviction rate.

20110131013441.000|20110131013443.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Problems with the SBI crime lab 
20110131013443.000|20110131013446.000|TR0|went far deeper than the Taylor case.
20110131013446.000|20110131013448.000|TR0|
20110131013448.000|20110131013451.000|TR0|NEFF:  And in several cases, the work just 
20110131013451.000|20110131013453.000|TR0|seems to be abysmal.  We found that tests 
20110131013453.000|20110131013456.000|TR0|were done but the results were not 
20110131013456.000|20110131013459.000|TR0|reported.  And so the defense never 
20110131013459.000|20110131013501.000|TR0|learned about them.

20110131013504.000|20110131013506.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  In one case that came out at 
20110131013506.000|20110131013509.000|TR0|trial, a lab's test videotaped by the SBI 
20110131013509.000|20110131013511.000|TR0|shows an agent trying to replicate a blood 
20110131013511.000|20110131013514.000|TR0|stain in an effort to prove the 
20110131013514.000|20110131013517.000|TR0|prosecution's case.  Until they get it 
20110131013517.000|20110131013519.000|TR0|right.

20110131013529.000|20110131013532.000|TR0|these agents, A, they had no policy for 
20110131013532.000|20110131013535.000|TR0|over 20 years to guide them, and, B, they 
20110131013535.000|20110131013537.000|TR0|were just running the most bizarre 
20110131013537.000|20110131013540.000|TR0|unscientific experiments to try to put 
20110131013540.000|20110131013542.000|TR0|people in prison for life.

20110131013550.000|20110131013553.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  The agent heard in the video, 
20110131013553.000|20110131013555.000|TR0|Dwayne Deaver, the same agent who failed 
20110131013555.000|20110131013558.000|TR0|to report Greg Taylor's second blood test.
20110131013558.000|20110131013600.000|TR0|
20110131013600.000|20110131013603.000|TR0|LOCKE:  You'd hoped that these were 
20110131013603.000|20110131013605.000|TR0|isolated incidents, but clearly the more 
20110131013605.000|20110131013608.000|TR0|we dug, the more we found that that wasn't 
20110131013608.000|20110131013611.000|TR0|the case.

20110131013613.000|20110131013616.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Because, it turns out, Greg 
20110131013616.000|20110131013618.000|TR0|Taylor wasn't the only innocent person to 
20110131013618.000|20110131013621.000|TR0|spend time behind bars because of the

20110131013629.000|20110131013631.000|TR0|This is Floyd Brown.  A man with the IQ of

20110131013642.000|20110131013644.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Floyd Brown was familiar figure 
20110131013644.000|20110131013647.000|TR0|here in downtown Wadesboro, North 
20110131013647.000|20110131013649.000|TR0|Carolina.  One of those guys you see 
20110131013649.000|20110131013652.000|TR0|hanging around the courthouse in a small 
20110131013652.000|20110131013654.000|TR0|town.  He even became friends with the 
20110131013654.000|20110131013657.000|TR0|clerks there.  Took their paychecks to the 
20110131013657.000|20110131013700.000|TR0|banks for them.  Which is why it was such 
20110131013700.000|20110131013702.000|TR0|a shock when on July 16th, 1993, an SBI

20110131013715.000|20110131013718.000|TR0|Everyone loved Floyd.  They knew he was 
20110131013718.000|20110131013720.000|TR0|slow.  They knew what his intellectual 
20110131013720.000|20110131013723.000|TR0|deficits were.  And to them, he was just a 
20110131013723.000|20110131013725.000|TR0|fixture.
20110131013725.000|20110131013728.000|TR0|
20110131013728.000|20110131013730.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  He had had run-ins 
20110131013730.000|20110131013733.000|TR0|with the police before, mostly for public 
20110131013733.000|20110131013736.000|TR0|drunkenness.  Once for assault.  But now 
20110131013736.000|20110131013738.000|TR0|Floyd was accused of robbing and killing 
20110131013738.000|20110131013741.000|TR0|80-year-old Katherine Lynch here in her 
20110131013741.000|20110131013743.000|TR0|home.  A witness told the SBI that a black

20110131014007.000|20110131014010.000|TR0|"My mama woke me up at 6:00 a.m."  Back 
20110131014010.000|20110131014013.000|TR0|then Floyd could not tell time.  
20110131014013.000|20110131014015.000|TR0|DEANGELUS:  It also said, "I live at this 
20110131014015.000|20110131014018.000|TR0|address."  Well, we know from records at 
20110131014018.000|20110131014020.000|TR0|that time, Floyd's never been able to 
20110131014020.000|20110131014023.000|TR0|recite his address.
20110131014023.000|20110131014025.000|TR0|
20110131014025.000|20110131014028.000|TR0|KLINKOSUM:  If you read the level of 
20110131014028.000|20110131014031.000|TR0|detail, if you read the structure of that 
20110131014031.000|20110131014033.000|TR0|confession, it reads like it's written by 
20110131014033.000|20110131014036.000|TR0|someone investigating a crime scene.
20110131014036.000|20110131014038.000|TR0|
20110131014038.000|20110131014041.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  The confession was 
20110131014041.000|20110131014043.000|TR0|the linchpin of a case with no physical 
20110131014043.000|20110131014046.000|TR0|evidence.

20110131014049.000|20110131014051.000|TR0|(On camera):  Was there any evidence

20110131014054.000|20110131014056.000|TR0|
20110131014056.000|20110131014059.000|TR0|KLINKOSUM:  No.  The only -- the only 
20110131014059.000|20110131014101.000|TR0|thing that puts Floyd in this case at all 
20110131014101.000|20110131014104.000|TR0|is the fictional confession.

20110131014107.000|20110131014109.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  But it was enough

20110131014127.000|20110131014130.000|TR0|
20110131014130.000|20110131014132.000|TR0|BROWN:  No.  I sure didn't.

20110131014213.000|20110131014216.000|TR0|Brown was involuntarily committed here,

20110131014237.000|20110131014239.000|TR0|mental that was wrong with him, it was

20110131014313.000|20110131014315.000|TR0|also entered into a kind of legal limbo, 
20110131014315.000|20110131014318.000|TR0|accused of murder but unable to have his 
20110131014318.000|20110131014320.000|TR0|day in court. Floyd Brown was 
20110131014320.000|20110131014323.000|TR0|developmentally disabled.  He had the mind 
20110131014323.000|20110131014326.000|TR0|of a 7- year-old and was ruled incompetent

20110131014336.000|20110131014338.000|TR0|GRIFFIN (voice-over):  The only evidence 
20110131014338.000|20110131014341.000|TR0|against Floyd was a confession he had 
20110131014341.000|20110131014344.000|TR0|signed misspelling his own name.

20110131014402.000|20110131014404.000|TR0|LOCKE:  His teachers from school and the 
20110131014404.000|20110131014407.000|TR0|doctors at Dorothy Addix believed that he 
20110131014407.000|20110131014409.000|TR0|was incapable of writing that confession.

20110131014608.000|20110131014610.000|TR0|back into the holding cell.  And I 
20110131014610.000|20110131014613.000|TR0|followed him back and I said, where are 
20110131014613.000|20110131014615.000|TR0|you going?  And he said court's over.  I

20110131014829.000|20110131014832.000|TR0|RUDOLPH:  Over the last 20 years a culture 
20110131014832.000|20110131014834.000|TR0|has developed at the SBI that basically

20110131014845.000|20110131014847.000|TR0|whatever evidence they can.  And if they 
20110131014847.000|20110131014850.000|TR0|can't find any, in Floyd's case, they 
20110131014850.000|20110131014852.000|TR0|couldn't, they manufactured it.

20110131014923.000|20110131014926.000|TR0|don't like my attitude at all. I told him 
20110131014926.000|20110131014928.000|TR0|I don't like his neither.  I got mad what 
20110131014928.000|20110131014931.000|TR0|he had did to me, he locked me up for a

20110131014941.000|20110131014944.000|TR0|involvement in the Floyd Brown case, Mark 
20110131014944.000|20110131014946.000|TR0|Isley was promoted.  Now he's under 
20110131014946.000|20110131014949.000|TR0|investigation.  We wanted to ask him about 
20110131014949.000|20110131014951.000|TR0|this, this six-page confession that he

20110131015004.000|20110131015007.000|TR0|LOCKE:  Over the years, Mark Isley climbed 
20110131015007.000|20110131015010.000|TR0|the ladder at the SBI, and today he 
20110131015010.000|20110131015012.000|TR0|supervises other SBI agents in the 
20110131015012.000|20110131015015.000|TR0|Medicaid fraud unit.  And his case wasn't

20110131015338.000|20110131015341.000|TR0|dozen states around the country where the 
20110131015341.000|20110131015343.000|TR0|crime lab reports to the Attorney 
20110131015343.000|20110131015346.000|TR0|General's Office.  Only 11 states have 
20110131015346.000|20110131015348.000|TR0|labs totally independent of law 
20110131015348.000|20110131015351.000|TR0|enforcement.

20110131015353.000|20110131015356.000|TR0|MUMMA:  They should be independent 
20110131015356.000|20110131015359.000|TR0|scientific organizations that are focused 
20110131015359.000|20110131015401.000|TR0|on the truth.  And they can't be under the 
20110131015401.000|20110131015404.000|TR0|control of someone or some organization 
20110131015404.000|20110131015406.000|TR0|that might cause them to be biased in 
20110131015406.000|20110131015409.000|TR0|their reporting.
20110131015409.000|20110131015411.000|TR0|
20110131015411.000|20110131015414.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  That's a lot bluer than it used 
20110131015414.000|20110131015417.000|TR0|to be.
20110131015417.000|20110131015419.000|TR0|
20110131015419.000|20110131015422.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Taylor's exoneration prompted 
20110131015422.000|20110131015424.000|TR0|North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper 
20110131015424.000|20110131015427.000|TR0|to order a massive review of 15,000 SBI 
20110131015427.000|20110131015429.000|TR0|crime lab cases involving blood analysis 
20110131015429.000|20110131015432.000|TR0|from 1987 through 2003.  Former FBI 
20110131015432.000|20110131015435.000|TR0|assistant director Chris Swecker was 
20110131015435.000|20110131015437.000|TR0|brought in to do that review. What he 
20110131015437.000|20110131015440.000|TR0|found was shocking.  Hundreds of cases 
20110131015440.000|20110131015442.000|TR0|like Greg Taylor's.

20110131015445.000|20110131015447.000|TR0|CHRIS SWECKER, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT 
20110131015447.000|20110131015450.000|TR0|DIRECTOR:  There were 200-plus cases, over 
20110131015450.000|20110131015453.000|TR0|230 cases, where reports were not complete 
20110131015453.000|20110131015455.000|TR0|or reports didn't actually correspond to 
20110131015455.000|20110131015458.000|TR0|the laboratory notes or information was 
20110131015458.000|20110131015500.000|TR0|not presented in the report that was in 
20110131015500.000|20110131015503.000|TR0|the laboratory notes as to the results of 
20110131015503.000|20110131015505.000|TR0|the test.
20110131015505.000|20110131015508.000|TR0|
20110131015508.000|20110131015511.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Swecker found the FBI suffered 
20110131015511.000|20110131015513.000|TR0|from a lack of objectivity, citing lab 
20110131015513.000|20110131015516.000|TR0|results that were overstated, misleading 
20110131015516.000|20110131015518.000|TR0|or failed to mention evidence that could 
20110131015518.000|20110131015521.000|TR0|have helped the defense attorneys.
20110131015521.000|20110131015523.000|TR0|
20110131015523.000|20110131015526.000|TR0|SWECKER:  I think a lot of analysts 
20110131015526.000|20110131015529.000|TR0|thought, look, their job is to get up to 
20110131015529.000|20110131015531.000|TR0|speed on this and cross examine me 
20110131015531.000|20110131015534.000|TR0|effectively and they'll draw all this out. 
20110131015534.000|20110131015536.000|TR0| So I don't have to tell them everything 
20110131015536.000|20110131015539.000|TR0|at this point. They can learn that at 
20110131015539.000|20110131015541.000|TR0|trial if they call me to the witness stand.
20110131015541.000|20110131015544.000|TR0|
20110131015544.000|20110131015547.000|TR0|I would reverse the role here for a second 
20110131015547.000|20110131015549.000|TR0|and say, hey, laboratory analysts, what if 
20110131015549.000|20110131015552.000|TR0|you were on trial for your life?  What 
20110131015552.000|20110131015554.000|TR0|would you want to know?

20110131015602.000|20110131015605.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Now just because the SBI 
20110131015605.000|20110131015607.000|TR0|withheld evidence doesn't mean those 
20110131015607.000|20110131015610.000|TR0|defendants were innocent, but they could 
20110131015610.000|20110131015612.000|TR0|have been.  And three of the cases 
20110131015612.000|20110131015615.000|TR0|involved people who have since been 
20110131015615.000|20110131015617.000|TR0|executed.  There are four more on death

20110131015625.000|20110131015628.000|TR0|Chris Swecker's report covers just a 
20110131015628.000|20110131015630.000|TR0|single division of the SBI crime lab, one 
20110131015630.000|20110131015633.000|TR0|that dealt with blood testing.  A full 
20110131015633.000|20110131015636.000|TR0|audit of the entire lab hasn't been done.
20110131015636.000|20110131015638.000|TR0|
20110131015638.000|20110131015641.000|TR0|LOCKE:  We don't know how many Greg 
20110131015641.000|20110131015643.000|TR0|Taylors are out there.  And until the lab 
20110131015643.000|20110131015646.000|TR0|goes about performing an independent audit 
20110131015646.000|20110131015648.000|TR0|of every unit over as many years as would 
20110131015648.000|20110131015651.000|TR0|affect cases of people still alive, we'll 
20110131015651.000|20110131015654.000|TR0|never know.  But we found enough problems 
20110131015654.000|20110131015656.000|TR0|to raise questions about the work in all 
20110131015656.000|20110131015659.000|TR0|of the cases.

20110131015704.000|20110131015706.000|TR0|North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper 
20110131015706.000|20110131015709.000|TR0|called for changes, like a new SBI 
20110131015709.000|20110131015712.000|TR0|director, higher standards and new 
20110131015712.000|20110131015714.000|TR0|certification for SBI scientists.  And 
20110131015714.000|20110131015717.000|TR0|from now on, all lab reports must be 
20110131015717.000|20110131015719.000|TR0|posted online for prosecutors to see and 
20110131015719.000|20110131015722.000|TR0|for defendants to obtain through 
20110131015722.000|20110131015724.000|TR0|discovery.  Cooper described the audit as 
20110131015724.000|20110131015727.000|TR0|troubling.

20110131015732.000|20110131015735.000|TR0|GENERAL:  It describes a practice that 
20110131015735.000|20110131015737.000|TR0|should have been unacceptable then and is 
20110131015737.000|20110131015740.000|TR0|unacceptable now. There's clearly work to 
20110131015740.000|20110131015742.000|TR0|do.
20110131015742.000|20110131015745.000|TR0|
20110131015745.000|20110131015748.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  But neither Cooper nor anyone 
20110131015748.000|20110131015750.000|TR0|else we requested from the DOJ would sit 
20110131015750.000|20110131015753.000|TR0|down and talk with us about what happened 
20110131015753.000|20110131015755.000|TR0|to Greg Taylor or Floyd Brown, saying in a 
20110131015755.000|20110131015758.000|TR0|statement their cases happened in the 
20110131015758.000|20110131015800.000|TR0|1990s when none of the current leadership 
20110131015800.000|20110131015803.000|TR0|was in place, and that significant 
20110131015803.000|20110131015806.000|TR0|improvements have been made since then.

20110131015808.000|20110131015811.000|TR0|Out of prison for a year, Greg Taylor 
20110131015811.000|20110131015813.000|TR0|isn't sure what's next.  For now, he's 
20110131015813.000|20110131015816.000|TR0|living off a $750,000 settlement from the 
20110131015816.000|20110131015818.000|TR0|state.

20110131015821.000|20110131015824.000|TR0|TAYLOR:  One person might say, gosh, 
20110131015824.000|20110131015826.000|TR0|that's a lot of money.  Another person 
20110131015826.000|20110131015829.000|TR0|might say that's a drop in the bucket 
20110131015829.000|20110131015831.000|TR0|compared to what you lived through.  So 
20110131015831.000|20110131015834.000|TR0|what I did is I just broke it down to $5 
20110131015834.000|20110131015836.000|TR0|an hour is what it came to and let people

20110131015857.000|20110131015900.000|TR0|in and he says, woe to those who sent me
