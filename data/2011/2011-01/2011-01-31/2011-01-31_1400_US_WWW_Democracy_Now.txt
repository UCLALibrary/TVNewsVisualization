20110131141516.150|20110131141517.986|TR0|respected. But he lived away too

20110131141527.168|20110131141529.004|TR0|International last night reading 
20110131141529.004|20110131141530.841|TR0|one of Sharif's tweets. Sharif 
20110131141530.841|20110131141532.677|TR0|grew up in Mubarak's Egypt. He 
20110131141532.677|20110131141534.513|TR0|was only three years old when 
20110131141534.513|20110131141536.350|TR0|the current regime came to 
20110131141536.350|20110131141538.186|TR0|power. He comes from a prominent 
20110131141538.186|20110131141540.022|TR0|Egyptian family with a long 
20110131141540.022|20110131141541.859|TR0|history in the arts, literature, 
20110131141541.859|20110131141543.695|TR0|film and politics.

20110131141549.204|20110131141551.041|TR0|ago, but it was not the same 
20110131141551.041|20110131141552.877|TR0|country you grew up in. Describe 
20110131141552.877|20110131141554.713|TR0|your feelings and what you have 
20110131141554.713|20110131141556.550|TR0|found, but start at the airport.

20110131141558.386|20110131141600.222|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Well, 
20110131141600.222|20110131141602.059|TR0|Amy, I've traveled to Egypt 
20110131141602.059|20110131141603.895|TR0|countless times from the United 
20110131141603.895|20110131141605.732|TR0|States after I moved there for 
20110131141605.732|20110131141607.568|TR0|college and then work, and when 
20110131141607.568|20110131141609.404|TR0|my plane from JFK touched down 
20110131141609.404|20110131141611.241|TR0|in Cairo International Airport 
20110131141611.241|20110131141613.077|TR0|on Saturday, the day after the 
20110131141613.077|20110131141614.913|TR0|massive protest where the 
20110131141614.913|20110131141616.750|TR0|protesters beat back the 
20110131141616.750|20110131141618.586|TR0|Interior Ministry, police and 
20110131141618.586|20110131141620.423|TR0|state security forces, I did 
20110131141620.423|20110131141622.259|TR0|land in a different country than 
20110131141622.259|20110131141624.095|TR0|the one I had known my entire 
20110131141624.095|20110131141625.932|TR0|life. Egypt has been reborn. 
20110131141625.932|20110131141627.768|TR0|This is not the Hosni Mubarak's 
20110131141627.768|20110131141629.604|TR0|Egypt anymore. And no matter 
20110131141629.604|20110131141631.441|TR0|what happens next, it will never 
20110131141631.441|20110131141633.277|TR0|be again.
20110131141633.277|20110131141635.114|TR0|
20110131141635.114|20110131141636.950|TR0|This is a unprecedented popular 
20110131141636.950|20110131141638.786|TR0|uprising, the likes of which 
20110131141638.786|20110131141640.623|TR0|myself and many others never 
20110131141640.623|20110131141642.459|TR0|thought they would see under 
20110131141642.459|20110131141644.295|TR0|President Mubarak. They are 
20110131141644.295|20110131141646.132|TR0|taking to the streets, men and 
20110131141646.132|20110131141647.968|TR0|women, rich and poor, all 
20110131141647.968|20110131141649.805|TR0|segments of society. They are 
20110131141649.805|20110131141651.641|TR0|defying the curfew for the past 
20110131141651.641|20110131141653.477|TR0|few days, packing into Tahrir 
20110131141653.477|20110131141655.314|TR0|Square. And their mood is 
20110131141655.314|20110131141657.150|TR0|celebratory, and it's 
20110131141657.150|20110131141658.986|TR0|victorious. They are sure. They 
20110131141658.986|20110131141700.823|TR0|are sure that they will not 
20110131141700.823|20110131141702.659|TR0|leave until Mubarak does. And 
20110131141702.659|20110131141704.496|TR0|they are chanting in the streets 
20110131141704.496|20110131141706.332|TR0|every day.
20110131141706.332|20110131141708.168|TR0|
20110131141708.168|20110131141710.005|TR0|They talk about what has taken 
20110131141710.005|20110131141711.841|TR0|place over the past week with 
20110131141711.841|20110131141713.677|TR0|such pride in what they have 
20110131141713.677|20110131141715.514|TR0|done. Tomorrow marks a week from 
20110131141715.514|20110131141717.350|TR0|the January 25th National Police 
20110131141717.350|20110131141719.187|TR0|Day, when the first protest 
20110131141719.187|20110131141721.023|TR0|began, and culminated on Friday. 
20110131141721.023|20110131141722.859|TR0|Friday was essentially a battle 
20110131141722.859|20110131141724.696|TR0|between the Interior Ministry 
20110131141724.696|20110131141726.532|TR0|and the people, and the people 
20110131141726.532|20110131141728.368|TR0|won. They talk about how they 
20110131141728.368|20110131141730.205|TR0|came up on the bridges leading 
20110131141730.205|20110131141732.041|TR0|to Tahrir, faced off with 
20110131141732.041|20110131141733.877|TR0|hundreds and hundreds of riot 
20110131141733.877|20110131141735.714|TR0|police from the Interior 
20110131141735.714|20110131141737.550|TR0|Ministry, from the state 
20110131141737.550|20110131141739.387|TR0|security forces, and were met 
20110131141739.387|20110131141741.223|TR0|with violence. They talk with 
20110131141741.223|20110131141743.059|TR0|how they walked with their hands 
20110131141743.059|20110131141744.896|TR0|up in the air, showing that they 
20110131141744.896|20110131141746.732|TR0|were coming peacefully, 
20110131141746.732|20110131141748.568|TR0|chanting, "Salmiya! Salmiya!" 
20110131141748.568|20110131141750.405|TR0|which means "Peacefully." And 
20110131141750.405|20110131141752.241|TR0|they were beat down. They were 
20110131141752.241|20110131141754.078|TR0|tear-gassed over and over again.
20110131141754.078|20110131141755.914|TR0|
20110131141755.914|20110131141757.750|TR0|And I'm not talking about, you 
20110131141757.750|20110131141759.587|TR0|know, hardcore activists and 
20110131141759.587|20110131141801.423|TR0|protesters, which have been 
20110131141801.423|20110131141803.259|TR0|taking to the streets 
20110131141803.259|20110131141805.096|TR0|increasingly over the last few 
20110131141805.096|20110131141806.932|TR0|years; I'm talking about people 
20110131141806.932|20110131141808.769|TR0|who had been depoliticized over 
20110131141808.769|20110131141810.605|TR0|the last few years, people from 
20110131141810.605|20110131141812.441|TR0|the middle class, young, the 
20110131141812.441|20110131141814.278|TR0|Facebook generation. What one 
20110131141814.278|20110131141816.114|TR0|person told me, this is the 
20110131141816.114|20110131141817.950|TR0|revolution of the Facebook 
20110131141817.950|20110131141819.787|TR0|generation. They came out in 
20110131141819.787|20110131141821.623|TR0|droves, old and young, and they 
20110131141821.623|20110131141823.460|TR0|took the streets. And what one 
20110131141823.460|20110131141825.296|TR0|person told me was, when they 
20110131141825.296|20110131141827.132|TR0|would be beat down and 
20110131141827.132|20110131141828.969|TR0|tear-gassed, others would come 
20110131141828.969|20110131141830.805|TR0|in and rush the police, and then 
20110131141830.805|20110131141832.641|TR0|they would fall down, and others 
20110131141832.641|20110131141834.478|TR0|would come back after them. And 
20110131141834.478|20110131141836.314|TR0|they said, "We gave each other 
20110131141836.314|20110131141838.151|TR0|courage."
20110131141838.151|20110131141839.987|TR0|
20110131141839.987|20110131141841.823|TR0|And as of 5:30 p.m., the police 
20110131141841.823|20110131141843.660|TR0|completely disappeared, 
20110131141843.660|20110131141845.496|TR0|reportedly on order, from the 
20110131141845.496|20110131141847.332|TR0|streets of Cairo. They were in 
20110131141847.332|20110131141849.169|TR0|full retreat, and they have 
20110131141849.169|20110131141851.005|TR0|disappeared. There is not a 
20110131141851.005|20110131141852.842|TR0|traffic policeman in Cairo. 
20110131141852.842|20110131141854.678|TR0|There's not any police anywhere. 
20110131141854.678|20110131141856.514|TR0|They have come down to the 
20110131141856.514|20110131141858.351|TR0|streets today.
20110131141858.351|20110131141900.187|TR0|
20110131141900.187|20110131141902.023|TR0|But since then, the military 
20110131141902.023|20110131141903.860|TR0|came in. And as many saw the 
20110131141903.860|20110131141905.696|TR0|images on the screens of how the 
20110131141905.696|20110131141907.533|TR0|military was greeted warmly on 
20110131141907.533|20110131141909.369|TR0|the streets of Cairo, you know, 
20110131141909.369|20110131141911.205|TR0|crowds were roaring with 
20110131141911.205|20110131141913.042|TR0|approval as tanks rolled in. And 
20110131141913.042|20110131141914.878|TR0|what's important to understand 
20110131141914.878|20110131141916.714|TR0|is that, you know, over the past 
20110131141916.714|20110131141918.551|TR0|decades, three decades, the 
20110131141918.551|20110131141920.387|TR0|state, the security forces and 
20110131141920.387|20110131141922.224|TR0|the police have been 
20110131141922.224|20110131141924.060|TR0|brutalizing, have been torturing 
20110131141924.060|20110131141925.896|TR0|the Egyptian people, have been 
20110131141925.896|20110131141927.733|TR0|wrongly imprisoning them, have 
20110131141927.733|20110131141929.569|TR0|been corrupt. But the army has 
20110131141929.569|20110131141931.405|TR0|not done this. The army has not 
20110131141931.405|20110131141933.242|TR0|had an interaction with the 
20110131141933.242|20110131141935.078|TR0|civilian population since the 
20110131141935.078|20110131141936.914|TR0|1973 war with Israel. And so, 
20110131141936.914|20110131141938.751|TR0|people trust the army. I've seen 
20110131141938.751|20110131141940.587|TR0|unbelievable scenes in Tahrir 
20110131141940.587|20110131141942.424|TR0|Square, where tanks have been 
20110131141942.424|20110131141944.260|TR0|just covered with people riding 
20110131141944.260|20110131141946.096|TR0|on the turret of the tank and 
20110131141946.096|20110131141947.933|TR0|all over the tanks, chanting. 
20110131141947.933|20110131141949.769|TR0|They pray on the tanks. They 
20110131141949.769|20110131141951.605|TR0|chant, "Al-gysh al-sha'ab yd 
20110131141951.605|20110131141953.442|TR0|wahda," which means "The army, 
20110131141953.442|20110131141955.278|TR0|the people are one hand." And 
20110131141955.278|20110131141957.115|TR0|I've seen soldiers carried on 
20110131141957.115|20110131141958.951|TR0|the shoulders of crowds through 
20110131141958.951|20110131142000.787|TR0|the crowds, chanting, holding 
20110131142000.787|20110131142002.624|TR0|flowers.
20110131142002.624|20110131142004.460|TR0|
20110131142004.460|20110131142006.296|TR0|Now, it remains to be seen what 
20110131142006.296|20110131142008.133|TR0|will happen going forward. 
20110131142008.133|20110131142009.969|TR0|Yesterday in Tahrir, at 4:00, 
20110131142009.969|20110131142011.806|TR0|there's been a 4:00 p.m. curfew 
20110131142011.806|20110131142013.642|TR0|yesterday. Today it's actually 
20110131142013.642|20110131142015.478|TR0|3:00 p.m. I'm talking to you, 
20110131142015.478|20110131142017.315|TR0|and the curfew is now in effect. 
20110131142017.315|20110131142019.151|TR0|I will be going to Tahrir after 
20110131142019.151|20110131142020.987|TR0|this interview. But people are 
20110131142020.987|20110131142022.824|TR0|in defiance of any kind of 
20110131142022.824|20110131142024.660|TR0|authority until Hosni Mubarak 
20110131142024.660|20110131142026.497|TR0|leaves. And yesterday we saw, in 
20110131142026.497|20110131142028.333|TR0|Tahrir, military jets, two 
20110131142028.333|20110131142030.169|TR0|fighter jets, and a helicopter 
20110131142030.169|20110131142032.006|TR0|continually swoop and do 
20110131142032.006|20110131142033.842|TR0|flyovers over Tahrir Square 
20110131142033.842|20110131142035.678|TR0|right at 4:00 p.m., when the 
20110131142035.678|20110131142037.515|TR0|curfew went into effect. And the 
20110131142037.515|20110131142039.351|TR0|jets kept getting louder and 
20110131142039.351|20110131142041.188|TR0|louder as they came lower. And 
20110131142041.188|20110131142043.024|TR0|whether it was an act of 
20110131142043.024|20110131142044.860|TR0|intimidation or not is unclear. 
20110131142044.860|20110131142046.697|TR0|But the crowds did not care. 
20110131142046.697|20110131142048.533|TR0|They waved and whistled and 
20110131142048.533|20110131142050.369|TR0|shouted to the planes as they 
20110131142050.369|20110131142052.206|TR0|passed overhead.
20110131142052.206|20110131142054.042|TR0|
20110131142054.042|20110131142055.879|TR0|There really is an unbelievable 
20110131142055.879|20110131142057.715|TR0|feeling of community now, of 
20110131142057.715|20110131142059.551|TR0|people coming together. I've 
20110131142059.551|20110131142101.388|TR0|never seen Egypt this way. 
20110131142101.388|20110131142103.224|TR0|People are picking up trash in 
20110131142103.224|20110131142105.060|TR0|Tahrir Square. People are 
20110131142105.060|20110131142106.897|TR0|handing out food. People are 
20110131142106.897|20110131142108.733|TR0|helping each other. People are 
20110131142108.733|20110131142110.570|TR0|sleeping in the middle of Tahrir 
20110131142110.570|20110131142112.406|TR0|Square and setting up tents in 
20110131142112.406|20110131142114.242|TR0|the middle of the square. It is 
20110131142114.242|20110131142116.079|TR0|a scene that is very emotional. 
20110131142116.079|20110131142117.915|TR0|It's something that no one 
20110131142117.915|20110131142119.751|TR0|thought could come together. 
20110131142119.751|20110131142121.588|TR0|It's largely leaderless. I mean, 
20110131142121.588|20110131142123.424|TR0|no one - there's no one 
20110131142123.424|20110131142125.260|TR0|organizing group. This is a 
20110131142125.260|20110131142127.097|TR0|popular uprising across all 
20110131142127.097|20110131142128.933|TR0|segments of society. Opposition 
20110131142128.933|20110131142130.770|TR0|groups have come now into the 
20110131142130.770|20110131142132.606|TR0|fold. They are - the Muslim 
20110131142132.606|20110131142134.442|TR0|Brotherhood is here, and other 
20110131142134.442|20110131142136.279|TR0|opposition groups. But people 
20110131142136.279|20110131142138.115|TR0|don't want it coopted. And, you 
20110131142138.115|20110131142139.951|TR0|know, one of the things that I 
20110131142139.951|20110131142141.788|TR0|witnessed that was very moving 
20110131142141.788|20110131142143.624|TR0|was a lot of the Brotherhood 
20110131142143.624|20110131142145.461|TR0|started chanting, "Allah Akbar," 
20110131142145.461|20110131142147.297|TR0|and then - which means "God is 
20110131142147.297|20110131142149.133|TR0|great" in Arabic. And then the 
20110131142149.133|20110131142150.970|TR0|counter chant that was much 
20110131142150.970|20110131142152.806|TR0|louder, reverberating over them, 
20110131142152.806|20110131142154.642|TR0|was to "Muslim, Christian, we 
20110131142154.642|20110131142156.479|TR0|are all Egyptian." And that 
20110131142156.479|20110131142158.315|TR0|really symbolizes what's 
20110131142158.315|20110131142200.152|TR0|happening here in Egypt today.
20110131142200.152|20110131142201.988|TR0|
20110131142201.988|20110131142203.824|TR0|And, you know, Amy, I've seen 
20110131142203.824|20110131142205.661|TR0|some reports - I've had very 
20110131142205.661|20110131142207.497|TR0|little access to any kind of 
20110131142207.497|20110131142209.333|TR0|outside news. They really have 
20110131142209.333|20110131142211.170|TR0|shut down - the internet is 
20110131142211.170|20110131142213.006|TR0|completely shut down here. Cell 
20110131142213.006|20110131142214.843|TR0|phones do work now, and people 
20110131142214.843|20110131142216.679|TR0|are starting to be able to call 
20110131142216.679|20110131142218.515|TR0|each other. There is no texting; 
20110131142218.515|20110131142220.352|TR0|no SMS texting goes out. And 
20110131142220.352|20110131142222.188|TR0|they are very afraid of the 
20110131142222.188|20110131142224.024|TR0|internet, because Facebook was 
20110131142224.024|20110131142225.861|TR0|how they organized this 
20110131142225.861|20110131142227.697|TR0|uprising, to begin with. It was 
20110131142227.697|20110131142229.534|TR0|organized on Facebook. And 
20110131142229.534|20110131142231.370|TR0|there's also mass SMS texting 
20110131142231.370|20110131142233.206|TR0|that is very common here in 
20110131142233.206|20110131142235.043|TR0|Egypt. And so, they've kept that 
20110131142235.043|20110131142236.879|TR0|shut down to try and cut off the 
20110131142236.879|20110131142238.715|TR0|communications from people. But 
20110131142238.715|20110131142240.552|TR0|people in Cairo do not care. 
20110131142240.552|20110131142242.388|TR0|They are going right now - I can 
20110131142242.388|20110131142244.225|TR0|see droves heading to Tahrir. 
20110131142244.225|20110131142246.061|TR0|And what's significant, they go 
20110131142246.061|20110131142247.897|TR0|at the time of the curfew. They 
20110131142247.897|20110131142249.734|TR0|go when the curfew is there, and 
20110131142249.734|20110131142251.570|TR0|that's when they start heading 
20110131142251.570|20110131142253.406|TR0|out.
20110131142253.406|20110131142255.243|TR0|
20110131142255.243|20110131142257.079|TR0|And there's been many reports of 
20110131142257.079|20110131142258.916|TR0|violence, of looting. And I just 
20110131142258.916|20110131142300.752|TR0|want to be very clear about 
20110131142300.752|20110131142302.588|TR0|this, that there was a 
20110131142302.588|20110131142304.425|TR0|significant amount of looting on 
20110131142304.425|20110131142306.261|TR0|Friday after the police 
20110131142306.261|20110131142308.097|TR0|completely disappeared from the 
20110131142308.097|20110131142309.934|TR0|scene. Certain places in 
20110131142309.934|20110131142311.770|TR0|Mohandessin in downtown Cairo 
20110131142311.770|20110131142313.607|TR0|were burned. Banks were burned. 
20110131142313.607|20110131142315.443|TR0|Some shops were looted. And, you 
20110131142315.443|20110131142317.279|TR0|know, there's been reports of 
20110131142317.279|20110131142319.116|TR0|armed gangs coming around and 
20110131142319.116|20110131142320.952|TR0|robbing houses. Some of that did 
20110131142320.952|20110131142322.788|TR0|happen, yes, but what's been 
20110131142322.788|20110131142324.625|TR0|amazing and what's also kind of 
20110131142324.625|20110131142326.461|TR0|another phase of how this is 
20110131142326.461|20110131142328.297|TR0|Egypt coming together in this 
20110131142328.297|20110131142330.134|TR0|popular movement is that people 
20110131142330.134|20110131142331.970|TR0|have taken to the streets and 
20110131142331.970|20110131142333.807|TR0|formed these very efficient 
20110131142333.807|20110131142335.643|TR0|neighborhood watch committees. 
20110131142335.643|20110131142337.479|TR0|Where I live here in Zamalek, 
20110131142337.479|20110131142339.316|TR0|there's groups of men, young and 
20110131142339.316|20110131142341.152|TR0|old, they stand, they form 
20110131142341.152|20110131142342.988|TR0|barricades. They are armed with 
20110131142342.988|20110131142344.825|TR0|metal pipes, some with bats. 
20110131142344.825|20110131142346.661|TR0|Some do have guns. And what they 
20110131142346.661|20110131142348.498|TR0|do is they check people coming 
20110131142348.498|20110131142350.334|TR0|in. They check their IDs. 
20110131142350.334|20110131142352.170|TR0|They're very courteous. They 
20110131142352.170|20110131142354.007|TR0|allow people to go through if 
20110131142354.007|20110131142355.843|TR0|they believe you live in the 
20110131142355.843|20110131142357.679|TR0|neighborhood. They have really - 
20110131142357.679|20110131142359.516|TR0|they're protecting their own. 
20110131142359.516|20110131142401.352|TR0|They're protecting their homes. 
20110131142401.352|20110131142403.189|TR0|They are directing traffic. 
20110131142403.189|20110131142405.025|TR0|Well, the traffic cops are back 
20110131142405.025|20110131142406.861|TR0|in the streets of Cairo today, 
20110131142406.861|20110131142408.698|TR0|but before that, they were 
20110131142408.698|20110131142410.534|TR0|directing traffic. I've never 
20110131142410.534|20110131142412.370|TR0|seen Cairo traffic so smooth. 
20110131142412.370|20110131142414.207|TR0|One former diplomat I spoke with 
20110131142414.207|20110131142416.043|TR0|said, "It's amazing. These 
20110131142416.043|20110131142417.880|TR0|15-year-old kids are doing such 
20110131142417.880|20110131142419.716|TR0|a much better job than our 
20110131142419.716|20110131142421.552|TR0|traffic police."
20110131142421.552|20110131142423.389|TR0|
20110131142423.389|20110131142425.225|TR0|That's the story of what's 
20110131142425.225|20110131142427.061|TR0|happening here. And people are 
20110131142427.061|20110131142428.898|TR0|so fed up with Mubarak, it's 
20110131142428.898|20110131142430.734|TR0|hard to describe. They curse 
20110131142430.734|20110131142432.571|TR0|him. They want him to step down. 
20110131142432.571|20110131142434.407|TR0|And they will not leave the 
20110131142434.407|20110131142436.243|TR0|streets of Cairo, the streets of 
20110131142436.243|20110131142438.080|TR0|Egypt, until he does.
20110131142438.080|20110131142439.916|TR0|
20110131142439.916|20110131142441.752|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We're talking to 
20110131142441.752|20110131142443.589|TR0|Sharif Abdel Kouddous on the 
20110131142443.589|20110131142445.425|TR0|ground in Cairo, who has figured

20110131142447.262|20110131142449.098|TR0|tweets, being seen around the 
20110131142449.098|20110131142450.934|TR0|world. You can go to our website 
20110131142450.934|20110131142452.771|TR0|at democracynow.org, so you can

20110131142454.607|20110131142456.443|TR0|throughout the day, as well as 
20110131142456.443|20110131142458.280|TR0|his blogs each day of what is 
20110131142458.280|20110131142500.116|TR0|happening in Cairo.
20110131142500.116|20110131142501.953|TR0|
20110131142501.953|20110131142503.789|TR0|I wanted to turn now, Sharif, to 
20110131142503.789|20110131142505.625|TR0|the Nobel Peace laureate, the 
20110131142505.625|20110131142507.462|TR0|former head of the IAEA, 
20110131142507.462|20110131142509.298|TR0|International Atomic Energy 
20110131142509.298|20110131142511.134|TR0|Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, who 
20110131142511.134|20110131142512.971|TR0|came into Tahrir Square this 
20110131142512.971|20110131142514.807|TR0|weekend and spoke. Well, on 
20110131142514.807|20110131142516.643|TR0|Sunday, CNN's Fareed Zakaria 
20110131142516.643|20110131142518.480|TR0|questioned ElBaradei about the 
20110131142518.480|20110131142520.316|TR0|Muslim Brotherhood.
20110131142520.316|20110131142522.153|TR0|
20110131142522.153|20110131142523.989|TR0|>> FAREED ZAKARIA: One of the 
20110131142523.989|20110131142525.825|TR0|visions that haunts Americans is 
20110131142525.825|20110131142527.662|TR0|of the Iranian Revolution, where 
20110131142527.662|20110131142529.498|TR0|a dictator, pro-American 
20110131142529.498|20110131142531.334|TR0|dictator, was replaced by an 
20110131142531.334|20110131142533.171|TR0|even worse regime that was even 
20110131142533.171|20110131142535.007|TR0|more anti-American and more 
20110131142535.007|20110131142536.844|TR0|threatening to the region. 
20110131142536.844|20110131142538.680|TR0|People worry about the Muslim 
20110131142538.680|20110131142540.516|TR0|Brotherhood. Are you confident 
20110131142540.516|20110131142542.353|TR0|that a post-Mubarak Egypt will 
20110131142542.353|20110131142544.189|TR0|not give rise to some kind of 
20110131142544.189|20110131142546.025|TR0|Islamic fundamentalist force 
20110131142546.025|20110131142547.862|TR0|that will undermine the 
20110131142547.862|20110131142549.698|TR0|democracy of Egypt?
20110131142549.698|20110131142551.535|TR0|
20110131142551.535|20110131142553.371|TR0|>> MOHAMED ELBARADEI: I am quite 
20110131142553.371|20110131142555.207|TR0|confident of that, Fareed. This 
20110131142555.207|20110131142557.044|TR0|is a myth that was sold by the 
20110131142557.044|20110131142558.880|TR0|Mubarak regime, that it's either 
20110131142558.880|20110131142600.716|TR0|us, the ruthless dictators, or a 
20110131142600.716|20110131142602.553|TR0|Muslim al-Qaeda type. You know, 
20110131142602.553|20110131142604.389|TR0|the Muslim Brotherhood has 
20110131142604.389|20110131142606.226|TR0|nothing to do with the Iranian 
20110131142606.226|20110131142608.062|TR0|model, has nothing to do with 
20110131142608.062|20110131142609.898|TR0|extremism, as we have seen it in 
20110131142609.898|20110131142611.735|TR0|Afghanistan and other places. 
20110131142611.735|20110131142613.571|TR0|The Muslim Brotherhood is a 
20110131142613.571|20110131142615.407|TR0|religiously conservative group. 
20110131142615.407|20110131142617.244|TR0|They are a minority in Egypt. 
20110131142617.244|20110131142619.080|TR0|They are not a majority of the 
20110131142619.080|20110131142620.917|TR0|Egyptian people. But they have a 
20110131142620.917|20110131142622.753|TR0|lot of credibility because all 
20110131142622.753|20110131142624.589|TR0|the other liberal parties have 
20110131142624.589|20110131142626.426|TR0|been smothered for 30 years.
20110131142626.426|20110131142628.262|TR0|
20110131142628.262|20110131142630.098|TR0|They are in favor of a secular 
20110131142630.098|20110131142631.935|TR0|state. They are in favor of 
20110131142631.935|20110131142633.771|TR0|working on the base of a 
20110131142633.771|20110131142635.608|TR0|constitution that have red 
20110131142635.608|20110131142637.444|TR0|lines, that every Egyptian have 
20110131142637.444|20110131142639.280|TR0|the same rights, same 
20110131142639.280|20110131142641.117|TR0|obligation. The state in no way 
20110131142641.117|20110131142642.953|TR0|will be a state based on 
20110131142642.953|20110131142644.789|TR0|religion. And I have been 
20110131142644.789|20110131142646.626|TR0|reaching out to them. We need to 
20110131142646.626|20110131142648.462|TR0|include them. They are part of 
20110131142648.462|20110131142650.299|TR0|the Egyptian society, as much as 
20110131142650.299|20110131142652.135|TR0|the Marxist party here. I think 
20110131142652.135|20110131142653.971|TR0|this myth that has been 
20110131142653.971|20110131142655.808|TR0|perpetuated and sold by the 
20110131142655.808|20110131142657.644|TR0|regime has no - has no iota of 
20110131142657.644|20110131142659.480|TR0|reality. As you know, Fareed, 
20110131142659.480|20110131142701.317|TR0|I've worked with Iranians. I 
20110131142701.317|20110131142703.153|TR0|have worked here. There is 100 
20110131142703.153|20110131142704.990|TR0|percent difference between the 
20110131142704.990|20110131142706.826|TR0|two societies.
20110131142706.826|20110131142708.662|TR0|
20110131142708.662|20110131142710.499|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was Mohamed 
20110131142710.499|20110131142712.335|TR0|ElBaradei speaking on CNN over 
20110131142712.335|20110131142714.171|TR0|the weekend. Sharif Abdel 
20110131142714.171|20110131142716.008|TR0|Kouddous, can you talk about the 
20110131142716.008|20110131142717.844|TR0|role of the Muslim Brotherhood?
20110131142717.844|20110131142719.680|TR0|
20110131142719.680|20110131142721.517|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Well, 
20110131142721.517|20110131142723.353|TR0|first of all, Amy, it's not for 
20110131142723.353|20110131142725.190|TR0|Fareed Zakaria or anyone else to 
20110131142725.190|20110131142727.026|TR0|decide what groups or what 
20110131142727.026|20110131142728.862|TR0|people are palatable to the 
20110131142728.862|20110131142730.699|TR0|United States to lead Egypt. 
20110131142730.699|20110131142732.535|TR0|That is up for Egyptians for 
20110131142732.535|20110131142734.371|TR0|themselves to decide. And so, I 
20110131142734.371|20110131142736.208|TR0|reject the way he asked that 
20110131142736.208|20110131142738.044|TR0|question.
20110131142738.044|20110131142739.881|TR0|
20110131142739.881|20110131142741.717|TR0|But as far as the Muslim 
20110131142741.717|20110131142743.553|TR0|Brotherhood is concerned, 
20110131142743.553|20110131142745.390|TR0|Mohamed ElBaradei did have some 
20110131142745.390|20110131142747.226|TR0|good points. They are a 
20110131142747.226|20110131142749.062|TR0|religious group. They are the 
20110131142749.062|20110131142750.899|TR0|largest opposition group here in 
20110131142750.899|20110131142752.735|TR0|Egypt, which doesn't say much 
20110131142752.735|20110131142754.572|TR0|because of the clampdown on any 
20110131142754.572|20110131142756.408|TR0|kind of opposition and dissent. 
20110131142756.408|20110131142758.244|TR0|They have renounced violence 
20110131142758.244|20110131142800.081|TR0|decades ago. They fulfilled a 
20110131142800.081|20110131142801.917|TR0|lot of the services that the 
20110131142801.917|20110131142803.753|TR0|state abandoned. And so, a lot 
20110131142803.753|20110131142805.590|TR0|of people have gone to - do 
20110131142805.590|20110131142807.426|TR0|support them.
20110131142807.426|20110131142809.263|TR0|
20110131142809.263|20110131142811.099|TR0|But again, they were not the 
20110131142811.099|20110131142812.935|TR0|ones that organized this 
20110131142812.935|20110131142814.772|TR0|uprising. They were not the ones 
20110131142814.772|20110131142816.608|TR0|that were in the streets. They 
20110131142816.608|20110131142818.444|TR0|were not the ones who fill 
20110131142818.444|20110131142820.281|TR0|Tahrir right now. Tahrir is 
20110131142820.281|20110131142822.117|TR0|being filled, and Cairo and 
20110131142822.117|20110131142823.954|TR0|Egypt is being, filled by people 
20110131142823.954|20110131142825.790|TR0|of all segments of society. In 
20110131142825.790|20110131142827.626|TR0|the future, will the Brotherhood 
20110131142827.626|20110131142829.463|TR0|play a part? I'm sure they'll be 
20110131142829.463|20110131142831.299|TR0|a significant force; there is no 
20110131142831.299|20110131142833.135|TR0|question of that. And it is 
20110131142833.135|20110131142834.972|TR0|true, they are different from 
20110131142834.972|20110131142836.808|TR0|the Iranian regime. But again, 
20110131142836.808|20110131142838.645|TR0|whether the Muslim Brotherhood 
20110131142838.645|20110131142840.481|TR0|or anyone else fits the U.S. 
20110131142840.481|20110131142842.317|TR0|model of what democracy should 
20110131142842.317|20110131142844.154|TR0|be like - democracy is for 
20110131142844.154|20110131142845.990|TR0|people to choose for themselves.
20110131142845.990|20110131142847.826|TR0|
20110131142847.826|20110131142849.663|TR0|And the Egyptian people want to 
20110131142849.663|20110131142851.499|TR0|choose for themselves. That's 
20110131142851.499|20110131142853.336|TR0|all they're asking. They're very 
20110131142853.336|20110131142855.172|TR0|politically aware. They're aware 
20110131142855.172|20110131142857.008|TR0|of the U.S. support for the 
20110131142857.008|20110131142858.845|TR0|Mubarak regime for the last 30 
20110131142858.845|20110131142900.681|TR0|years. I've had protesters come 
20110131142900.681|20110131142902.517|TR0|up to me - people come up to me 
20110131142902.517|20110131142904.354|TR0|holding up tear gas canisters, 
20110131142904.354|20110131142906.190|TR0|fired tear gas canisters, 
20110131142906.190|20110131142908.026|TR0|showing me the "Made in U.S.A." 
20110131142908.026|20110131142909.863|TR0|sign, showing me how, you know, 
20110131142909.863|20110131142911.699|TR0|the weapons used against them 
20110131142911.699|20110131142913.536|TR0|were made in the U.S. They 
20110131142913.536|20110131142915.372|TR0|realize this. And all they ask 
20110131142915.372|20110131142917.208|TR0|for - you know, this isn't a big 
20110131142917.208|20110131142919.045|TR0|anti-American rally. You don't 
20110131142919.045|20110131142920.881|TR0|see burning of American flags or 
20110131142920.881|20110131142922.717|TR0|anything like that. All they ask 
20110131142922.717|20110131142924.554|TR0|for is to be left alone to be 
20110131142924.554|20110131142926.390|TR0|able to decide for themselves.
20110131142926.390|20110131142928.227|TR0|
20110131142928.227|20110131142930.063|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Sharif, I'd like 
20110131142930.063|20110131142931.899|TR0|to ask you to stay on the phone. 
20110131142931.899|20110131142933.736|TR0|We're going to be joined by two

20110131143006.790|20110131143008.627|TR0|Kouddous, Democracy Now! senior 
20110131143008.627|20110131143010.463|TR0|producer, is on the ground in 
20110131143010.463|20110131143012.300|TR0|Cairo. Sharif, I wanted to 
20110131143012.300|20110131143014.136|TR0|continue to discuss how - your 
20110131143014.136|20110131143015.972|TR0|feelings as you flew into the 
20110131143015.972|20110131143017.809|TR0|country. You come from one of 
20110131143017.809|20110131143019.645|TR0|the most prominent families in 
20110131143019.645|20110131143021.481|TR0|Egypt, your grandfather one of 
20110131143021.481|20110131143023.318|TR0|the most famous writers, Ihsan 
20110131143023.318|20110131143025.154|TR0|Abdel Quddous. Your 
20110131143025.154|20110131143026.991|TR0|great-grandmother, Rosa al 
20110131143026.991|20110131143028.827|TR0|Youssef, a magazine she founded 
20110131143028.827|20110131143030.663|TR0|still exists today. And your 
20110131143030.663|20110131143032.500|TR0|uncle - you came into Tahrir 
20110131143032.500|20110131143034.336|TR0|Square, where you saw him being 
20110131143034.336|20110131143036.172|TR0|greeted by many. Describe the 
20110131143036.172|20110131143038.009|TR0|scene.
20110131143038.009|20110131143039.845|TR0|
20110131143039.845|20110131143041.682|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Well, 
20110131143041.682|20110131143043.518|TR0|Amy, my uncle is Mohamed Abdel 
20110131143043.518|20110131143045.354|TR0|Quddoos. He's a leading 
20110131143045.354|20110131143047.191|TR0|opposition protester. He's now 
20110131143047.191|20110131143049.027|TR0|head of the Freedom Committee at 
20110131143049.027|20110131143050.863|TR0|the Press Syndicate, and he has 
20110131143050.863|20110131143052.700|TR0|ties to the Muslim Brotherhood 
20110131143052.700|20110131143054.536|TR0|himself. And, Amy, he's been 
20110131143054.536|20110131143056.373|TR0|protesting for years. There's 
20110131143056.373|20110131143058.209|TR0|been a growing movement here in 
20110131143058.209|20110131143100.045|TR0|Egypt of protests, of people 
20110131143100.045|20110131143101.882|TR0|trying to voice their dissent. 
20110131143101.882|20110131143103.718|TR0|But they have been harshly 
20110131143103.718|20110131143105.554|TR0|clamped down on. And what we 
20110131143105.554|20110131143107.391|TR0|typically used to see was people 
20110131143107.391|20110131143109.227|TR0|like my uncle and other 
20110131143109.227|20110131143111.063|TR0|opposition voices speaking in 
20110131143111.063|20110131143112.900|TR0|Tahrir on the steps of the Press 
20110131143112.900|20110131143114.736|TR0|Syndicate, but they would be 
20110131143114.736|20110131143116.573|TR0|about a dozen and then 
20110131143116.573|20110131143118.409|TR0|surrounded by hundreds of 
20110131143118.409|20110131143120.245|TR0|police, and it would be quickly 
20110131143120.245|20110131143122.082|TR0|shut down. They would be 
20110131143122.082|20110131143123.918|TR0|arrested. They would be driven 
20110131143123.918|20110131143125.754|TR0|out into the middle of the 
20110131143125.754|20110131143127.591|TR0|desert and left there, without 
20110131143127.591|20110131143129.427|TR0|their wallet or phone, to find 
20110131143129.427|20110131143131.264|TR0|their way back, which is a 
20110131143131.264|20110131143133.100|TR0|common tactic by the police - 
20110131143133.100|20110131143134.936|TR0|completely shut down. And for 
20110131143134.936|20110131143136.773|TR0|years, my uncle was - his 
20110131143136.773|20110131143138.609|TR0|standard attire, he would leave 
20110131143138.609|20110131143140.445|TR0|the building wearing a suit, 
20110131143140.445|20110131143142.282|TR0|holding a megaphone and a flag 
20110131143142.282|20110131143144.118|TR0|of Egypt in his hand, and he 
20110131143144.118|20110131143145.955|TR0|would go into the streets.
20110131143145.955|20110131143147.791|TR0|
20110131143147.791|20110131143149.627|TR0|And this was - I saw him 
20110131143149.627|20110131143151.464|TR0|yesterday in the square. He was 
20110131143151.464|20110131143153.300|TR0|there with his megaphone and 
20110131143153.300|20110131143155.136|TR0|flag and his suit all crumpled 
20110131143155.136|20110131143156.973|TR0|because he had spent the night 
20110131143156.973|20110131143158.809|TR0|in Tahrir. And I sat down next 
20110131143158.809|20110131143200.646|TR0|to him, and I said, "How are you 
20110131143200.646|20110131143202.482|TR0|feeling now?" And he was 
20110131143202.482|20110131143204.318|TR0|overwhelmed with emotion. He 
20110131143204.318|20110131143206.155|TR0|said, "This is a dream come 
20110131143206.155|20110131143207.991|TR0|true." And he pointed over to 
20110131143207.991|20110131143209.827|TR0|where the Press Syndicate is, 
20110131143209.827|20110131143211.664|TR0|and he said, "You remember when 
20110131143211.664|20110131143213.500|TR0|I used to stand on the steps of 
20110131143213.500|20110131143215.337|TR0|that Press Syndicate to protest? 
20110131143215.337|20110131143217.173|TR0|I would stand alone. Now look at 
20110131143217.173|20110131143219.009|TR0|everyone. They're all here with 
20110131143219.009|20110131143220.846|TR0|me."
20110131143220.846|20110131143222.682|TR0|
20110131143222.682|20110131143224.518|TR0|And he went on to say how this 
20110131143224.518|20110131143226.355|TR0|was not his uprising, it was not 
20110131143226.355|20110131143228.191|TR0|his revolt. He said this was 
20110131143228.191|20110131143230.028|TR0|done by young people. And he's 
20110131143230.028|20110131143231.864|TR0|the one who called it "the 
20110131143231.864|20110131143233.700|TR0|revolution of the Facebook 
20110131143233.700|20110131143235.537|TR0|generation." He said there's 
20110131143235.537|20110131143237.373|TR0|been - he said, "Tunis was the 
20110131143237.373|20110131143239.209|TR0|catalyst and the spark, but it's 
20110131143239.209|20110131143241.046|TR0|been building for so many 
20110131143241.046|20110131143242.882|TR0|years." And he said there's 
20110131143242.882|20110131143244.719|TR0|three similarities between Egypt 
20110131143244.719|20110131143246.555|TR0|and Tunis that he saw. He said 
20110131143246.555|20110131143248.391|TR0|this was organized through 
20110131143248.391|20110131143250.228|TR0|Facebook and was a leaderless 
20110131143250.228|20110131143252.064|TR0|movement - that's one. He said 
20110131143252.064|20110131143253.900|TR0|the president will fall; of 
20110131143253.900|20110131143255.737|TR0|that, he is sure - that's two. 
20110131143255.737|20110131143257.573|TR0|And three, he says the army 
20110131143257.573|20110131143259.409|TR0|supports the people and won't 
20110131143259.409|20110131143301.246|TR0|harm them; of that, he is sure, 
20110131143301.246|20110131143303.082|TR0|too.
20110131143303.082|20110131143304.919|TR0|
20110131143304.919|20110131143306.755|TR0|But it was a very moving scene 
20110131143306.755|20110131143308.591|TR0|being with him there. And the 
20110131143308.591|20110131143310.428|TR0|people in Tahrir, the people who 
20110131143310.428|20110131143312.264|TR0|came out to protest, who 
20110131143312.264|20110131143314.100|TR0|recognized him, his years of 
20110131143314.100|20110131143315.937|TR0|struggle alone - and as I was 
20110131143315.937|20110131143317.773|TR0|talking to him, dozens of people 
20110131143317.773|20110131143319.610|TR0|would come shake his hand, kiss 
20110131143319.610|20110131143321.446|TR0|him hello, take pictures with 
20110131143321.446|20110131143323.282|TR0|him. And they paying tribute to 
20110131143323.282|20110131143325.119|TR0|his years of struggle that have 
20110131143325.119|20110131143326.955|TR0|helped to bring about this mass 
20110131143326.955|20110131143328.791|TR0|uprising in the streets.
20110131143328.791|20110131143330.628|TR0|
20110131143330.628|20110131143332.464|TR0|And just one last thing, Amy, 
20110131143332.464|20110131143334.301|TR0|before you move on. I know -
20110131143334.301|20110131143336.137|TR0|
20110131143336.137|20110131143337.973|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Just one point, 
20110131143337.973|20110131143339.810|TR0|Sharif, just one point -
20110131143339.810|20110131143341.646|TR0|
20110131143341.646|20110131143343.482|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Go 
20110131143343.482|20110131143345.319|TR0|ahead.
20110131143345.319|20110131143347.155|TR0|
20110131143347.155|20110131143348.992|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: In the first few 
20110131143348.992|20110131143350.828|TR0|days of this uprising, he was 
20110131143350.828|20110131143352.664|TR0|one of the first arrested. Is 
20110131143352.664|20110131143354.501|TR0|that right?
20110131143354.501|20110131143356.337|TR0|
20110131143356.337|20110131143358.173|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Oh, 
20110131143358.173|20110131143400.010|TR0|yes. On Tuesday, the first day, 
20110131143400.010|20110131143401.846|TR0|on January 25th, he was on the 
20110131143401.846|20110131143403.683|TR0|steps of the Press Syndicate 
20110131143403.683|20110131143405.519|TR0|with other journalists. They 
20110131143405.519|20110131143407.355|TR0|were protesting. He was arrested 
20110131143407.355|20110131143409.192|TR0|by five plainclothes police 
20110131143409.192|20110131143411.028|TR0|officers. There was a picture of 
20110131143411.028|20110131143412.864|TR0|him being dragged away that was 
20110131143412.864|20110131143414.701|TR0|circulated widely on the 
20110131143414.701|20110131143416.537|TR0|internet and on Facebook. He was 
20110131143416.537|20110131143418.374|TR0|held for several hours at a 
20110131143418.374|20110131143420.210|TR0|police station. When they 
20110131143420.210|20110131143422.046|TR0|realized who he was, they let 
20110131143422.046|20110131143423.883|TR0|him go. He refused to leave 
20110131143423.883|20110131143425.719|TR0|until other students, 20 other 
20110131143425.719|20110131143427.555|TR0|students that were arrested with 
20110131143427.555|20110131143429.392|TR0|him, were let go. And so, he 
20110131143429.392|20110131143431.228|TR0|remained in the prison for about 
20110131143431.228|20110131143433.065|TR0|six more hours, until the 
20110131143433.065|20110131143434.901|TR0|students were let go, as well. 
20110131143434.901|20110131143436.737|TR0|He was also arrested again on 
20110131143436.737|20110131143438.574|TR0|Friday and driven out, in that 
20110131143438.574|20110131143440.410|TR0|same tactic, out into the 
20110131143440.410|20110131143442.246|TR0|desert. But he came back.
20110131143442.246|20110131143444.083|TR0|
20110131143444.083|20110131143445.919|TR0|And one thing, Amy, I think 
20110131143445.919|20110131143447.755|TR0|there's been this fear of the 
20110131143447.755|20110131143449.592|TR0|police force and of the interior 
20110131143449.592|20110131143451.428|TR0|state security forces for so 
20110131143451.428|20110131143453.265|TR0|long. Regardless of what 
20110131143453.265|20110131143455.101|TR0|happens, if they come back in 
20110131143455.101|20110131143456.937|TR0|the streets, if they come back 
20110131143456.937|20110131143458.774|TR0|into power, I don't think the 
20110131143458.774|20110131143500.610|TR0|Egyptian people will ever fear 
20110131143500.610|20110131143502.446|TR0|them in the same way again, 
20110131143502.446|20110131143504.283|TR0|because they went to battle 
20110131143504.283|20110131143506.119|TR0|against them and they won. And I 
20110131143506.119|20110131143507.956|TR0|think they are the ones who will 
20110131143507.956|20110131143509.792|TR0|be afraid of the people now.

20110131143548.356|20110131143550.192|TR0|massive popular rebellion in

20110131143552.029|20110131143553.865|TR0|Professor?
20110131143553.865|20110131143555.701|TR0|
20110131143555.701|20110131143557.538|TR0|>> SAMER SHEHATA: Yes. Well, 
20110131143557.538|20110131143559.374|TR0|it's something that is 
20110131143559.374|20110131143601.210|TR0|incredibly - it's remarkable. 
20110131143601.210|20110131143603.047|TR0|It's something that none of us 
20110131143603.047|20110131143604.883|TR0|expected, if you would have 
20110131143604.883|20110131143606.720|TR0|asked us a month ago. Certainly, 
20110131143606.720|20110131143608.556|TR0|the reasons are long in the 
20110131143608.556|20110131143610.392|TR0|coming. This is a regime that 
20110131143610.392|20110131143612.229|TR0|has been authoritarian from the 
20110131143612.229|20110131143614.065|TR0|very beginning, even before 
20110131143614.065|20110131143615.901|TR0|President Mubarak. It's a regime 
20110131143615.901|20110131143617.738|TR0|that has tried to use the 
20110131143617.738|20110131143619.574|TR0|institutions of democracy in a 
20110131143619.574|20110131143621.411|TR0|facade-like manner to sell 
20110131143621.411|20110131143623.247|TR0|itself as a democracy to the 
20110131143623.247|20110131143625.083|TR0|West, but, of course, it's 
20110131143625.083|20110131143626.920|TR0|nothing close to that.
20110131143626.920|20110131143628.756|TR0|
20110131143628.756|20110131143630.592|TR0|There are also economic reasons 
20110131143630.592|20110131143632.429|TR0|that are underpinning these 
20110131143632.429|20110131143634.265|TR0|protests. As you know, 20 
20110131143634.265|20110131143636.102|TR0|percent of Egyptians live below 
20110131143636.102|20110131143637.938|TR0|poverty, and another 20 percent 
20110131143637.938|20110131143639.774|TR0|of Egyptians live close to the 
20110131143639.774|20110131143641.611|TR0|poverty line. Inflation has been 
20110131143641.611|20110131143643.447|TR0|very high over the last number 
20110131143643.447|20110131143645.283|TR0|of years. Income inequality, 
20110131143645.283|20110131143647.120|TR0|according to the World Bank and 
20110131143647.120|20110131143648.956|TR0|the IMF, has increased, as well.
20110131143648.956|20110131143650.792|TR0|
20110131143650.792|20110131143652.629|TR0|And President Mubarak, I think 
20110131143652.629|20110131143654.465|TR0|it should not be mistaken, is a 
20110131143654.465|20110131143656.302|TR0|dictator. He is a dictator. And 
20110131143656.302|20110131143658.138|TR0|what people are calling for is 
20110131143658.138|20110131143659.974|TR0|not just a change in the 
20110131143659.974|20110131143701.811|TR0|ministers or a new minister of 
20110131143701.811|20110131143703.647|TR0|finance, but a different regime. 
20110131143703.647|20110131143705.483|TR0|They want Mubarak to leave. And 
20110131143705.483|20110131143707.320|TR0|I think it would also not be 
20110131143707.320|20110131143709.156|TR0|acceptable, for all of the 
20110131143709.156|20110131143710.993|TR0|people on the streets, if the 
20110131143710.993|20110131143712.829|TR0|newly appointed vice president 
20110131143712.829|20110131143714.665|TR0|were simply to take over. He is 
20110131143714.665|20110131143716.502|TR0|also part of the regime. And 
20110131143716.502|20110131143718.338|TR0|what they're calling for is a 
20110131143718.338|20110131143720.174|TR0|fundamentally different type of 
20110131143720.174|20110131143722.011|TR0|politics. And I think that 
20110131143722.011|20110131143723.847|TR0|tomorrow, with the calls that 
20110131143723.847|20110131143725.684|TR0|we've heard today for a national 
20110131143725.684|20110131143727.520|TR0|day of protest, a million-person 
20110131143727.520|20110131143729.356|TR0|march tomorrow, hopefully, 
20110131143729.356|20110131143731.193|TR0|hopefully, this regime will come 
20110131143731.193|20110131143733.029|TR0|to an end.
20110131143733.029|20110131143734.865|TR0|
20110131143734.865|20110131143736.702|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20110131143736.702|20110131143738.538|TR0|about how economics - you're a 
20110131143738.538|20110131143740.375|TR0|specialist in labor in Egypt. 
20110131143740.375|20110131143742.211|TR0|The situation in Tunisia, which 
20110131143742.211|20110131143744.047|TR0|seems certainly to have lit the 
20110131143744.047|20110131143745.884|TR0|spark in Egypt, and the 
20110131143745.884|20110131143747.720|TR0|situation in Egypt - what, 40 
20110131143747.720|20110131143749.556|TR0|percent of people are in poverty 
20110131143749.556|20110131143751.393|TR0|in Egypt - how did they feed 
20110131143751.393|20110131143753.229|TR0|into this popular uprising?
20110131143753.229|20110131143755.066|TR0|
20110131143755.066|20110131143756.902|TR0|>> SAMER SHEHATA: Well, that's 
20110131143756.902|20110131143758.738|TR0|certainly correct. I mean, with 
20110131143758.738|20110131143800.575|TR0|regard to the events in Tunisia 
20110131143800.575|20110131143802.411|TR0|and the events in Egypt, I think 
20110131143802.411|20110131143804.247|TR0|that the economic situation, of 
20110131143804.247|20110131143806.084|TR0|course, is far worse in Egypt. 
20110131143806.084|20110131143807.920|TR0|The levels of income in Tunisia 
20110131143807.920|20110131143809.757|TR0|are twice those in Egypt. 
20110131143809.757|20110131143811.593|TR0|Mohamed Bouazizi, the gentleman 
20110131143811.593|20110131143813.429|TR0|who self-immolated himself on 
20110131143813.429|20110131143815.266|TR0|December the 17th, was quite 
20110131143815.266|20110131143817.102|TR0|symptomatic of millions of 
20110131143817.102|20110131143818.938|TR0|people across the Arab world, 
20110131143818.938|20110131143820.775|TR0|even beyond Egypt, in Jordan and 
20110131143820.775|20110131143822.611|TR0|Yemen and Algeria and so on, who 
20110131143822.611|20110131143824.448|TR0|are young, who have some level 
20110131143824.448|20110131143826.284|TR0|of education - in his case, it 
20110131143826.284|20110131143828.120|TR0|was a high school education - 
20110131143828.120|20110131143829.957|TR0|but really who have no realistic 
20110131143829.957|20110131143831.793|TR0|job opportunities or future in 
20110131143831.793|20110131143833.629|TR0|front of them. The figures 
20110131143833.629|20110131143835.466|TR0|regarding unemployment in 
20110131143835.466|20110131143837.302|TR0|Tunisia and Egypt and other 
20110131143837.302|20110131143839.138|TR0|places are very high. In 
20110131143839.138|20110131143840.975|TR0|Tunisia, it was officially 14.7 
20110131143840.975|20110131143842.811|TR0|percent. This is according to 
20110131143842.811|20110131143844.648|TR0|the IMF. And then, if we look at 
20110131143844.648|20110131143846.484|TR0|certain segments of the 
20110131143846.484|20110131143848.320|TR0|population, youth elements in 
20110131143848.320|20110131143850.157|TR0|the population, those below 25 
20110131143850.157|20110131143851.993|TR0|years of age - and, of course, 
20110131143851.993|20110131143853.829|TR0|these are youthful countries, 
20110131143853.829|20110131143855.666|TR0|where half the population is 
20110131143855.666|20110131143857.502|TR0|below the age of 30 - the 
20110131143857.502|20110131143859.339|TR0|percentage of unemployed among 
20110131143859.339|20110131143901.175|TR0|the youth is significantly 
20110131143901.175|20110131143903.011|TR0|higher, three times what the 
20110131143903.011|20110131143904.848|TR0|official rate is. So, in Egypt, 
20110131143904.848|20110131143906.684|TR0|the economic situation is even 
20110131143906.684|20110131143908.520|TR0|worse than Tunisia. Tunisia is 
20110131143908.520|20110131143910.357|TR0|rich in comparison to Egypt.
20110131143910.357|20110131143912.193|TR0|
20110131143912.193|20110131143914.030|TR0|You mentioned the percentage of 
20110131143914.030|20110131143915.866|TR0|people under poverty. But also, 
20110131143915.866|20110131143917.702|TR0|beginning in 2004, of course, 
20110131143917.702|20110131143919.539|TR0|Egypt began implementing 
20110131143919.539|20110131143921.375|TR0|economic reforms called for by 
20110131143921.375|20110131143923.211|TR0|the IMF - or really forced on 
20110131143923.211|20110131143925.048|TR0|them by the IMF and the World 
20110131143925.048|20110131143926.884|TR0|Bank - from the late 1980s and 
20110131143926.884|20110131143928.721|TR0|the early '90s, economic reform 
20110131143928.721|20110131143930.557|TR0|and structural adjustment 
20110131143930.557|20110131143932.393|TR0|programs of privatization, 
20110131143932.393|20110131143934.230|TR0|subsidy cuts, opening up 
20110131143934.230|20110131143936.066|TR0|markets, deregulation and so on. 
20110131143936.066|20110131143937.902|TR0|But the Egyptian government did 
20110131143937.902|20110131143939.739|TR0|it in a very hesitant fashion, 
20110131143939.739|20110131143941.575|TR0|unwillingly at first. But in 
20110131143941.575|20110131143943.412|TR0|2004, something radical 
20110131143943.412|20110131143945.248|TR0|happened, and a new government 
20110131143945.248|20110131143947.084|TR0|was appointed, new ministers 
20110131143947.084|20110131143948.921|TR0|were appointed, who believed 
20110131143948.921|20110131143950.757|TR0|wholeheartedly in the ideas of 
20110131143950.757|20110131143952.593|TR0|the IMF and the World Bank. And 
20110131143952.593|20110131143954.430|TR0|they quite vigorously pursued 
20110131143954.430|20110131143956.266|TR0|these policies. And there was at 
20110131143956.266|20110131143958.103|TR0|one level, at the level of 
20110131143958.103|20110131143959.939|TR0|macroeconomic indicators, 
20110131143959.939|20110131144001.775|TR0|statistics, GDP growth rates, 
20110131144001.775|20110131144003.612|TR0|foreign direct investment and so 
20110131144003.612|20110131144005.448|TR0|on - Egypt seemed to be a 
20110131144005.448|20110131144007.284|TR0|miracle. And this, of course, 
20110131144007.284|20110131144009.121|TR0|was the case with the Tunisian 
20110131144009.121|20110131144010.957|TR0|model earlier. You'll remember 
20110131144010.957|20110131144012.794|TR0|that Jacques Chirac called it 
20110131144012.794|20110131144014.630|TR0|the "economic miracle," and it 
20110131144014.630|20110131144016.466|TR0|was the darling of the IMF and 
20110131144016.466|20110131144018.303|TR0|the World Bank, because it 
20110131144018.303|20110131144020.139|TR0|implemented these types of 
20110131144020.139|20110131144021.975|TR0|reforms earlier. Well, of 
20110131144021.975|20110131144023.812|TR0|course, we saw what happened in 
20110131144023.812|20110131144025.648|TR0|Tunisia. In Egypt also, from 
20110131144025.648|20110131144027.485|TR0|2004 until the present, the 
20110131144027.485|20110131144029.321|TR0|government and its reforms were 
20110131144029.321|20110131144031.157|TR0|applauded in Washington by World 
20110131144031.157|20110131144032.994|TR0|Bank, IMF and U.S. officials. 
20110131144032.994|20110131144034.830|TR0|GDP growth rates were above six 
20110131144034.830|20110131144036.666|TR0|percent in consecutive years. 
20110131144036.666|20110131144038.503|TR0|Egypt received the top reformer 
20110131144038.503|20110131144040.339|TR0|award from the IMF and the World 
20110131144040.339|20110131144042.175|TR0|Bank, tremendous foreign direct 
20110131144042.175|20110131144044.012|TR0|investment.
20110131144044.012|20110131144045.848|TR0|
20110131144045.848|20110131144047.685|TR0|But what all of that masked, 
20110131144047.685|20110131144049.521|TR0|what all of that masked, was 
20110131144049.521|20110131144051.357|TR0|what was going on at the level 
20110131144051.357|20110131144053.194|TR0|of real people and ordinary 
20110131144053.194|20110131144055.030|TR0|lives. Real incomes were 
20110131144055.030|20110131144056.866|TR0|declining as a result of 
20110131144056.866|20110131144058.703|TR0|incredibly high inflation, not 
20110131144058.703|20110131144100.539|TR0|as high as in Zimbabwe or 
20110131144100.539|20110131144102.376|TR0|Venezuela, but inflation rates 
20110131144102.376|20110131144104.212|TR0|of 25, 30 percent, eating away 
20110131144104.212|20110131144106.048|TR0|at people's incomes. Basic 
20110131144106.048|20110131144107.885|TR0|commodities, foodstuffs, prices 
20110131144107.885|20110131144109.721|TR0|were increasing tremendously. In 
20110131144109.721|20110131144111.557|TR0|2008, about 13 or 14 people, 
20110131144111.557|20110131144113.394|TR0|Egyptians, died as a result of 
20110131144113.394|20110131144115.230|TR0|conflicts resulting from them 
20110131144115.230|20110131144117.067|TR0|waiting in long bread queues, 
20110131144117.067|20110131144118.903|TR0|because there wasn't enough 
20110131144118.903|20110131144120.739|TR0|bread, and violence would erupt. 
20110131144120.739|20110131144122.576|TR0|People were waiting in line for 
20110131144122.576|20110131144124.412|TR0|hours to obtain subsidized 
20110131144124.412|20110131144126.248|TR0|bread, which is also one of the 
20110131144126.248|20110131144128.085|TR0|bases of this regime, you see. 
20110131144128.085|20110131144129.921|TR0|It has to do that in order to at 
20110131144129.921|20110131144131.758|TR0|least have some kind of 
20110131144131.758|20110131144133.594|TR0|acquiescence from the public. 
20110131144133.594|20110131144135.430|TR0|So, what these macroeconomic 
20110131144135.430|20110131144137.267|TR0|indicators masked was what 
20110131144137.267|20110131144139.103|TR0|people were experiencing at the 
20110131144139.103|20110131144140.939|TR0|level of everyday life and real 
20110131144140.939|20110131144142.776|TR0|income. As I mentioned, poverty 
20110131144142.776|20110131144144.612|TR0|was increasing. Income 
20110131144144.612|20110131144146.449|TR0|inequality was increasing. And 
20110131144146.449|20110131144148.285|TR0|even corruption was increasing, 
20110131144148.285|20110131144150.121|TR0|according to Transparency 
20110131144150.121|20110131144151.958|TR0|International.
20110131144151.958|20110131144153.794|TR0|
20110131144153.794|20110131144155.630|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20110131144155.630|20110131144157.467|TR0|about what happened this 
20110131144157.467|20110131144159.303|TR0|weekend, that President Mubarak 
20110131144159.303|20110131144201.140|TR0|responded to the mass protests 
20110131144201.140|20110131144202.976|TR0|not by resigning himself, but by 
20110131144202.976|20110131144204.812|TR0|saying he would dissolve the 
20110131144204.812|20110131144206.649|TR0|parliament? He then went on to 
20110131144206.649|20110131144208.485|TR0|talk about one of the so-called 
20110131144208.485|20110131144210.321|TR0|new names, Omar Suleiman, who, 
20110131144210.321|20110131144212.158|TR0|as Jane Mayer points out in a 
20110131144212.158|20110131144213.994|TR0|piece in The New Yorker over the 
20110131144213.994|20110131144215.831|TR0|weekend, is actually not so new 
20110131144215.831|20110131144217.667|TR0|to anyone who has followed the 
20110131144217.667|20110131144219.503|TR0|American policy of renditions 
20110131144219.503|20110131144221.340|TR0|for terror suspects. She writes, 
20110131144221.340|20110131144223.176|TR0|"Since 1993 Suleiman [has] 
20110131144223.176|20110131144225.012|TR0|headed the feared Egyptian 
20110131144225.012|20110131144226.849|TR0|general intelligence service. In 
20110131144226.849|20110131144228.685|TR0|that capacity, he was the 
20110131144228.685|20110131144230.521|TR0|C.I.A.'s point man in Egypt for 
20110131144230.521|20110131144232.358|TR0|renditions -- the covert program 
20110131144232.358|20110131144234.194|TR0|in which the C.I.A. snatched 
20110131144234.194|20110131144236.031|TR0|terror suspects from around the 
20110131144236.031|20110131144237.867|TR0|world and returned them to Egypt 
20110131144237.867|20110131144239.703|TR0|and elsewhere for interrogation, 
20110131144239.703|20110131144241.540|TR0|often under brutal 
20110131144241.540|20110131144243.376|TR0|circumstances. [...] He has 
20110131144243.376|20110131144245.212|TR0|served for years as the main 
20110131144245.212|20110131144247.049|TR0|conduit between the United 
20110131144247.049|20110131144248.885|TR0|States and Mubarak."
20110131144248.885|20110131144250.722|TR0|
20110131144250.722|20110131144252.558|TR0|>> SAMER SHEHATA: Yes. Well, 
20110131144252.558|20110131144254.394|TR0|with regard to what happened 
20110131144254.394|20110131144256.231|TR0|over the weekend and President 
20110131144256.231|20110131144258.067|TR0|Mubarak's speech on Friday, and 
20110131144258.067|20110131144259.903|TR0|then the subsequent events of 
20110131144259.903|20110131144301.740|TR0|appointing a vice president, 
20110131144301.740|20110131144303.576|TR0|these are attempts to save Mr. 
20110131144303.576|20110131144305.413|TR0|Mubarak and to save his regime. 
20110131144305.413|20110131144307.249|TR0|These are steps that fall far 
20110131144307.249|20110131144309.085|TR0|short of what millions of 
20110131144309.085|20110131144310.922|TR0|Egyptians are calling for and 
20110131144310.922|20110131144312.758|TR0|the only thing that's going to 
20110131144312.758|20110131144314.594|TR0|lead this revolution to end, 
20110131144314.594|20110131144316.431|TR0|which is the regime to end and 
20110131144316.431|20110131144318.267|TR0|for a new government with people 
20110131144318.267|20110131144320.104|TR0|unaffiliated with the previous 
20110131144320.104|20110131144321.940|TR0|corrupt and despotic regime to 
20110131144321.940|20110131144323.776|TR0|come to power. So Mubarak was 
20110131144323.776|20110131144325.613|TR0|trying to save himself by 
20110131144325.613|20110131144327.449|TR0|offering some concessions. And 
20110131144327.449|20110131144329.285|TR0|those concessions were, of 
20110131144329.285|20110131144331.122|TR0|course, as you mentioned, 
20110131144331.122|20110131144332.958|TR0|dismissing the parliament and 
20110131144332.958|20110131144334.795|TR0|then appointing a vice 
20110131144334.795|20110131144336.631|TR0|president, something that 
20110131144336.631|20110131144338.467|TR0|Egyptians have been asking for 
20110131144338.467|20110131144340.304|TR0|for 30 years - this is a country 
20110131144340.304|20110131144342.140|TR0|that has been without a vice 
20110131144342.140|20110131144343.976|TR0|president for that long; he's 
20110131144343.976|20110131144345.813|TR0|refused to appoint one - and 
20110131144345.813|20110131144347.649|TR0|then, of course, appointing a 
20110131144347.649|20110131144349.486|TR0|prime minister. It's also 
20110131144349.486|20110131144351.322|TR0|interesting to note that both of 
20110131144351.322|20110131144353.158|TR0|these individuals are military 
20110131144353.158|20110131144354.995|TR0|figures, right? That's also 
20110131144354.995|20110131144356.831|TR0|something that's not very 
20110131144356.831|20110131144358.667|TR0|heartening.
20110131144358.667|20110131144400.504|TR0|
20110131144400.504|20110131144402.340|TR0|And then, with regard to Mr. 
20110131144402.340|20110131144404.177|TR0|Suleiman, of course, it is not 
20110131144404.177|20110131144406.013|TR0|so much feared, the, you know, 
20110131144406.013|20110131144407.849|TR0|Egyptian general intelligence, 
20110131144407.849|20110131144409.686|TR0|but certainly an integral part 
20110131144409.686|20110131144411.522|TR0|of the regime. And he is someone 
20110131144411.522|20110131144413.358|TR0|who, before his appointment, 
20110131144413.358|20110131144415.195|TR0|before his appointment, had some 
20110131144415.195|20110131144417.031|TR0|respect among the Egyptian 
20110131144417.031|20110131144418.868|TR0|people. He's clearly very 
20110131144418.868|20110131144420.704|TR0|intelligent. He has tried to 
20110131144420.704|20110131144422.540|TR0|stay out of the limelight. He  
20110131144422.540|20110131144424.377|TR0|--  there is not known directly 
20110131144424.377|20110131144426.213|TR0|that he has been involved in 
20110131144426.213|20110131144428.049|TR0|corruption, unlike many other of 
20110131144428.049|20110131144429.886|TR0|the previous ministers and so 
20110131144429.886|20110131144431.722|TR0|on. So, before his appointment, 
20110131144431.722|20110131144433.558|TR0|he had some legitimacy. And in 
20110131144433.558|20110131144435.395|TR0|fact, with the rise of Gamal 
20110131144435.395|20110131144437.231|TR0|Mubarak over the last number of 
20110131144437.231|20110131144439.068|TR0|years, many Egyptians were 
20110131144439.068|20110131144440.904|TR0|putting his name forward  --

20110131144444.577|20110131144446.413|TR0|Mubarak.
20110131144446.413|20110131144448.249|TR0|
20110131144448.249|20110131144450.086|TR0|>> SAMER SHEHATA: With the rise 
20110131144450.086|20110131144451.922|TR0|of Gamal Mubarak, the 
20110131144451.922|20110131144453.759|TR0|president's son, into higher 
20110131144453.759|20110131144455.595|TR0|posts in the government, and the 
20110131144455.595|20110131144457.431|TR0|idea that he was going to be 
20110131144457.431|20110131144459.268|TR0|implanted or installed as a 
20110131144459.268|20110131144501.104|TR0|president through farcical 
20110131144501.104|20110131144502.940|TR0|elections in the future, 
20110131144502.940|20110131144504.777|TR0|earlier, people were putting 
20110131144504.777|20110131144506.613|TR0|Omar Suleiman's name up as 
20110131144506.613|20110131144508.450|TR0|someone who would be much more 
20110131144508.450|20110131144510.286|TR0|acceptable. Of course, all of 
20110131144510.286|20110131144512.122|TR0|that has changed now, and Mr. 
20110131144512.122|20110131144513.959|TR0|Suleiman has lost any kind of 
20110131144513.959|20110131144515.795|TR0|legitimacy or credibility he 
20110131144515.795|20110131144517.631|TR0|had, because this is nothing 
20110131144517.631|20110131144519.468|TR0|other than a tactic that the 
20110131144519.468|20110131144521.304|TR0|Mubarak - Mubarak himself is 
20110131144521.304|20110131144523.141|TR0|using to try to hold onto power.
20110131144523.141|20110131144524.977|TR0|
20110131144524.977|20110131144526.813|TR0|With regard to his involvement 
20110131144526.813|20110131144528.650|TR0|in the rendition program and so 
20110131144528.650|20110131144530.486|TR0|on, this is also - not that fact 
20110131144530.486|20110131144532.322|TR0|in particular, but his behavior 
20110131144532.322|20110131144534.159|TR0|and his actions and his views 
20110131144534.159|20110131144535.995|TR0|are also apparent in the 
20110131144535.995|20110131144537.832|TR0|WikiLeaks documents. He is 
20110131144537.832|20110131144539.668|TR0|someone who is clearly not 
20110131144539.668|20110131144541.504|TR0|committed to any conception of 
20110131144541.504|20110131144543.341|TR0|democracy. He says in the 
20110131144543.341|20110131144545.177|TR0|WikiLeaks documents that the 
20110131144545.177|20110131144547.013|TR0|Muslim Brotherhood, of course, 
20110131144547.013|20110131144548.850|TR0|is a very dangerous Islamist 
20110131144548.850|20110131144550.686|TR0|group that needs to be excluded 
20110131144550.686|20110131144552.523|TR0|completely from politics. It's 
20110131144552.523|20110131144554.359|TR0|also clear that he believes that 
20110131144554.359|20110131144556.195|TR0|Egypt should maintain the 
20110131144556.195|20110131144558.032|TR0|blockade of Gaza, creating this 
20110131144558.032|20110131144559.868|TR0|1.5 million open-air prison, as 
20110131144559.868|20110131144601.704|TR0|it were. He is very well known 
20110131144601.704|20110131144603.541|TR0|in the United States, because he 
20110131144603.541|20110131144605.377|TR0|has been coming here regularly. 
20110131144605.377|20110131144607.214|TR0|He has handled, been the point 
20110131144607.214|20110131144609.050|TR0|person for the very important 
20110131144609.050|20110131144610.886|TR0|issues of 
20110131144610.886|20110131144612.723|TR0|Palestinian-Palestinian 
20110131144612.723|20110131144614.559|TR0|relations, Egypt's relationship 
20110131144614.559|20110131144616.395|TR0|with Israel. He is also the 
20110131144616.395|20110131144618.232|TR0|gentleman, the point person for 
20110131144618.232|20110131144620.068|TR0|Egypt's relationship with Sudan 
20110131144620.068|20110131144621.904|TR0|and Omar al-Bashir and so on. 
20110131144621.904|20110131144623.741|TR0|Those types of foreign policy 
20110131144623.741|20110131144625.577|TR0|concerns in Egypt are not 
20110131144625.577|20110131144627.414|TR0|handled by the Foreign Ministry, 
20110131144627.414|20110131144629.250|TR0|but are handled by the security 
20110131144629.250|20110131144631.086|TR0|services.
20110131144631.086|20110131144632.923|TR0|
20110131144632.923|20110131144634.759|TR0|So he would be someone who would 
20110131144634.759|20110131144636.595|TR0|be unacceptable, I think, if 
20110131144636.595|20110131144638.432|TR0|we're genuinely concerned about 
20110131144638.432|20110131144640.268|TR0|the development of democracy. 
20110131144640.268|20110131144642.105|TR0|He's unacceptable if you talk to 
20110131144642.105|20110131144643.941|TR0|and listen to what the millions 
20110131144643.941|20110131144645.777|TR0|of people on Egypt's streets are 
20110131144645.777|20110131144647.614|TR0|saying. He's someone who might 
20110131144647.614|20110131144649.450|TR0|be, unfortunately, acceptable to 
20110131144649.450|20110131144651.286|TR0|capitals abroad. But of course, 
20110131144651.286|20110131144653.123|TR0|as Sharif mentioned, that's not 
20110131144653.123|20110131144654.959|TR0|the primary concern here. The 
20110131144654.959|20110131144656.796|TR0|primary concern here is what 
20110131144656.796|20110131144658.632|TR0|millions of Egyptians want and 
20110131144658.632|20110131144700.468|TR0|deserve, and that is a 
20110131144700.468|20110131144702.305|TR0|government that represents their 
20110131144702.305|20110131144704.141|TR0|interests, a government that is 
20110131144704.141|20110131144705.977|TR0|elected by free and fair 
20110131144705.977|20110131144707.814|TR0|elections.

20110131144715.159|20110131144716.996|TR0|be reassured" if he were chosen. 
20110131144716.996|20110131144718.832|TR0|He is chosen now as the vice 
20110131144718.832|20110131144720.668|TR0|president of Egypt by Mubarak, a 
20110131144720.668|20110131144722.505|TR0|position that hasn't been filled 
20110131144722.505|20110131144724.341|TR0|in many, many years. Samer

20110131144735.359|20110131144737.196|TR0|given Egypt. It has tremendous 
20110131144737.196|20110131144739.032|TR0|power over what Mubarak does 
20110131144739.032|20110131144740.869|TR0|right now, given the tens of 
20110131144740.869|20110131144742.705|TR0|billions of dollars, mainly in 
20110131144742.705|20110131144744.541|TR0|military aid, it's given the

20110131144808.414|20110131144810.250|TR0|examined how the United States 
20110131144810.250|20110131144812.087|TR0|has propped up the flagging 
20110131144812.087|20110131144813.923|TR0|Mubarak regime, largely with

20110131144835.960|20110131144837.796|TR0|doesn't necessarily go to Egypt,

20110131144856.160|20110131144857.996|TR0|all kinds of missiles, for guns, 
20110131144857.996|20110131144859.833|TR0|for tear gas canisters, as was 
20110131144859.833|20110131144901.669|TR0|discussed, a company called 
20110131144901.669|20110131144903.505|TR0|Combined Systems International, 
20110131144903.505|20110131144905.342|TR0|which actually has its name on 
20110131144905.342|20110131144907.178|TR0|the side of the canisters that 
20110131144907.178|20110131144909.014|TR0|have been found on the streets 
20110131144909.014|20110131144910.851|TR0|there. So these companies - for 
20110131144910.851|20110131144912.687|TR0|example, Lockheed Martin has 
20110131144912.687|20110131144914.524|TR0|been the leader in deals worth 
20110131144914.524|20110131144916.360|TR0|$3.8 billion over that period of 
20110131144916.360|20110131144918.196|TR0|the last 10 years; General 
20110131144918.196|20110131144920.033|TR0|Dynamics, $2.5 billion for 
20110131144920.033|20110131144921.869|TR0|tanks; Boeing, $1.7 billion for 
20110131144921.869|20110131144923.705|TR0|missiles, for helicopters; 
20110131144923.705|20110131144925.542|TR0|Raytheon for all manner of 
20110131144925.542|20110131144927.378|TR0|missiles for the armed forces. 
20110131144927.378|20110131144929.215|TR0|So, basically, this is a key 
20110131144929.215|20110131144931.051|TR0|element in propping up the 
20110131144931.051|20110131144932.887|TR0|regime, but a lot of the money, 
20110131144932.887|20110131144934.724|TR0|as you said and Juan Cole 
20110131144934.724|20110131144936.560|TR0|mentioned on this program, is 
20110131144936.560|20110131144938.396|TR0|basically recycled. Taxpayers 
20110131144938.396|20110131144940.233|TR0|could just as easily be giving 
20110131144940.233|20110131144942.069|TR0|it directly to Lockheed Martin 
20110131144942.069|20110131144943.906|TR0|or General Dynamics.
20110131144943.906|20110131144945.742|TR0|
20110131144945.742|20110131144947.578|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, the U.S. has 
20110131144947.578|20110131144949.415|TR0|tremendous power, wields 
20110131144949.415|20110131144951.251|TR0|tremendous power here, right? 
20110131144951.251|20110131144953.087|TR0|And I want to also put this 
20110131144953.087|20110131144954.924|TR0|question to Professor Shehata, 
20110131144954.924|20110131144956.760|TR0|and that is the issue of U.S. 
20110131144956.760|20110131144958.597|TR0|law. I mean, I remember well, in 
20110131144958.597|20110131145000.433|TR0|covering the Indonesian 
20110131145000.433|20110131145002.269|TR0|occupation of East Timor, that 
20110131145002.269|20110131145004.106|TR0|the issue for Indonesia, when 
20110131145004.106|20110131145005.942|TR0|they invaded - this, one of the 
20110131145005.942|20110131145007.778|TR0|worst genocides of the 20th 
20110131145007.778|20110131145009.615|TR0|century - was to get the 
20110131145009.615|20110131145011.451|TR0|approval of the United States, 
20110131145011.451|20110131145013.287|TR0|because otherwise the U.S. would 
20110131145013.287|20110131145015.124|TR0|cut off aid. You can't use U.S. 
20110131145015.124|20110131145016.960|TR0|weapons for offensive acts - at 
20110131145016.960|20110131145018.797|TR0|least, that's the law. And they 
20110131145018.797|20110131145020.633|TR0|illegally invaded East Timor. 
20110131145020.633|20110131145022.469|TR0|What about the Mubarak regime 
20110131145022.469|20110131145024.306|TR0|using these weapons on the 
20110131145024.306|20110131145026.142|TR0|people who are rebelling?
20110131145026.142|20110131145027.978|TR0|
20110131145027.978|20110131145029.815|TR0|>> SAMER SHEHATA: Right. I mean, 
20110131145029.815|20110131145031.651|TR0|it's a very important and timely 
20110131145031.651|20110131145033.488|TR0|question. I should just add that 
20110131145033.488|20110131145035.324|TR0|those planes that were flying 
20110131145035.324|20110131145037.160|TR0|over Tahrir Square, flying low 
20110131145037.160|20110131145038.997|TR0|over the thousands of peaceful 
20110131145038.997|20110131145040.833|TR0|protesters in the center of 
20110131145040.833|20110131145042.669|TR0|Cairo yesterday, appeared to be 
20110131145042.669|20110131145044.506|TR0|F-16s made in the United States 
20110131145044.506|20110131145046.342|TR0|of America. And the tanks on the 
20110131145046.342|20110131145048.179|TR0|streets in Egypt, in Cairo, in 
20110131145048.179|20110131145050.015|TR0|Alexandria and other cities, are 
20110131145050.015|20110131145051.851|TR0|either Abrams tanks or tanks 
20110131145051.851|20110131145053.688|TR0|that are American tanks but made 
20110131145053.688|20110131145055.524|TR0|in Egypt. There's an agreement 
20110131145055.524|20110131145057.360|TR0|that that can take place. And 
20110131145057.360|20110131145059.197|TR0|so, this is very much a serious 
20110131145059.197|20110131145101.033|TR0|issue, and the United States 
20110131145101.033|20110131145102.870|TR0|does have tremendous influence 
20110131145102.870|20110131145104.706|TR0|over President Mubarak.
20110131145104.706|20110131145106.542|TR0|
20110131145106.542|20110131145108.379|TR0|It doesn't seem like he's 
20110131145108.379|20110131145110.215|TR0|listening to the calibrated 
20110131145110.215|20110131145112.051|TR0|change in statements coming out 
20110131145112.051|20110131145113.888|TR0|of Washington, because it seems 
20110131145113.888|20110131145115.724|TR0|now, in the diplomatic language 
20110131145115.724|20110131145117.561|TR0|that's been used, that the 
20110131145117.561|20110131145119.397|TR0|United States is saying it wants 
20110131145119.397|20110131145121.233|TR0|a peaceful transition. They 
20110131145121.233|20110131145123.070|TR0|haven't said explicitly - and 
20110131145123.070|20110131145124.906|TR0|governments don't say this - 
20110131145124.906|20110131145126.742|TR0|"Mubarak has to leave right 
20110131145126.742|20110131145128.579|TR0|now," but I think that's the 
20110131145128.579|20110131145130.415|TR0|implication. I certainly don't 
20110131145130.415|20110131145132.252|TR0|think it's gone far enough, but 
20110131145132.252|20110131145134.088|TR0|right now it doesn't seem like 
20110131145134.088|20110131145135.924|TR0|Mr. Mubarak is really listening 
20110131145135.924|20110131145137.761|TR0|or understands the severity of 
20110131145137.761|20110131145139.597|TR0|the situation or is just 
20110131145139.597|20110131145141.433|TR0|incredibly stubborn and wants to 
20110131145141.433|20110131145143.270|TR0|hold on until the last minute.
20110131145143.270|20110131145145.106|TR0|
20110131145145.106|20110131145146.943|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, the military 
20110131145146.943|20110131145148.779|TR0|weapons that are going, Bill 
20110131145148.779|20110131145150.615|TR0|Hartung, the support that goes 
20110131145150.615|20110131145152.452|TR0|to U.S. corporations, they won't 
20110131145152.452|20110131145154.288|TR0|be pleased with cutting off aid 
20110131145154.288|20110131145156.124|TR0|to Egypt, because it's actually 
20110131145156.124|20110131145157.961|TR0|going to them.
20110131145157.961|20110131145159.797|TR0|
20110131145159.797|20110131145201.633|TR0|>> WILLIAM HARTUNG: Exactly, 
20110131145201.633|20110131145203.470|TR0|because they don't know what a 
20110131145203.470|20110131145205.306|TR0|new regime will want to do. Will 
20110131145205.306|20110131145207.143|TR0|they want to maintain that huge 
20110131145207.143|20110131145208.979|TR0|armed forces that was made in 
20110131145208.979|20110131145210.815|TR0|the U.S.A.? How might they use 
20110131145210.815|20110131145212.652|TR0|those in defense of the country? 
20110131145212.652|20110131145214.488|TR0|So it's unlikely, if you had a 
20110131145214.488|20110131145216.324|TR0|new regime, that they would come 
20110131145216.324|20110131145218.161|TR0|in for big multi-billion-dollar 
20110131145218.161|20110131145219.997|TR0|deals for a bloated military 
20110131145219.997|20110131145221.834|TR0|when there's needs for their own 
20110131145221.834|20110131145223.670|TR0|people.
20110131145223.670|20110131145225.506|TR0|
20110131145225.506|20110131145227.343|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: According to 
20110131145227.343|20110131145229.179|TR0|lists of arms sales 
20110131145229.179|20110131145231.015|TR0|notifications compiled by the

20110131145232.852|20110131145234.688|TR0|Assistance Agency, in the last 
20110131145234.688|20110131145236.525|TR0|decade alone, the Department of 
20110131145236.525|20110131145238.361|TR0|Defense has brokered over $11 
20110131145238.361|20110131145240.197|TR0|billion in U.S. arms offers to 
20110131145240.197|20110131145242.034|TR0|the Egyptian regime on behalf of 
20110131145242.034|20110131145243.870|TR0|weapons manufacturers Lockheed 
20110131145243.870|20110131145245.706|TR0|Martin, General Dynamics, 
20110131145245.706|20110131145247.543|TR0|Boeing, Raytheon and General

20110131145251.216|20110131145253.052|TR0|>> WILLIAM HARTUNG: And that's 
20110131145253.052|20110131145254.888|TR0|just the last little while. In 
20110131145254.888|20110131145256.725|TR0|fact, Mubarak has been getting 
20110131145256.725|20110131145258.561|TR0|$1.3 billion per year, like 
20110131145258.561|20110131145300.397|TR0|clockwork, since the beginning 
20110131145300.397|20110131145302.234|TR0|of his regime. So that's about 
20110131145302.234|20110131145304.070|TR0|$40 billion, that a lot of which 
20110131145304.070|20110131145305.907|TR0|has gone to these companies. So 
20110131145305.907|20110131145307.743|TR0|they, of course - you know, 
20110131145307.743|20110131145309.579|TR0|they've met with lobbyists. 
20110131145309.579|20110131145311.416|TR0|They've met with Egypt over the 
20110131145311.416|20110131145313.252|TR0|years. They've tried to keep the 
20110131145313.252|20110131145315.088|TR0|United States on good terms with 
20110131145315.088|20110131145316.925|TR0|Egypt, because they profit from 
20110131145316.925|20110131145318.761|TR0|this relationship.

20110131145404.670|20110131145406.507|TR0|Welcome to Democracy Now! Your 
20110131145406.507|20110131145408.343|TR0|feelings today in the midst of 
20110131145408.343|20110131145410.180|TR0|this popular rebellion against 
20110131145410.180|20110131145412.016|TR0|the Mubarak regime, calling on 
20110131145412.016|20110131145413.852|TR0|Mubarak to leave? Do you agree?
20110131145413.852|20110131145415.689|TR0|
20110131145415.689|20110131145417.525|TR0|>> NAWAL EL SAADAWI: We are in 
20110131145417.525|20110131145419.361|TR0|the streets every day, people, 
20110131145419.361|20110131145421.198|TR0|children, old people, including 
20110131145421.198|20110131145423.034|TR0|myself. I am now 80 years of 
20110131145423.034|20110131145424.871|TR0|age, suffering of this regime 
20110131145424.871|20110131145426.707|TR0|for half a century. And you 
20110131145426.707|20110131145428.543|TR0|remember, Mubarak is the 
20110131145428.543|20110131145430.380|TR0|continuation of Sadat. And both 
20110131145430.380|20110131145432.216|TR0|Sadat and Mubarak, you know, 
20110131145432.216|20110131145434.052|TR0|their regime worked against the 
20110131145434.052|20110131145435.889|TR0|people, men and women. And they 
20110131145435.889|20110131145437.725|TR0|created this gap between the 
20110131145437.725|20110131145439.562|TR0|poor and rich. They brought the 
20110131145439.562|20110131145441.398|TR0|so-called business class to 
20110131145441.398|20110131145443.234|TR0|govern us. Egypt became an 
20110131145443.234|20110131145445.071|TR0|American colony. And we are 
20110131145445.071|20110131145446.907|TR0|dominated by the U.S. and 
20110131145446.907|20110131145448.743|TR0|Israel. And 80 million people, 
20110131145448.743|20110131145450.580|TR0|men and women, have no say in 
20110131145450.580|20110131145452.416|TR0|the country.
20110131145452.416|20110131145454.253|TR0|
20110131145454.253|20110131145456.089|TR0|And you see today that people in 
20110131145456.089|20110131145457.925|TR0|the streets for six days, and 
20110131145457.925|20110131145459.762|TR0|they told Mubarak to go. He 
20110131145459.762|20110131145501.598|TR0|should have gone, if he respects 
20110131145501.598|20110131145503.434|TR0|the will of the people. That's 
20110131145503.434|20110131145505.271|TR0|democracy. Because what's 
20110131145505.271|20110131145507.107|TR0|democracy? It's to respect the 
20110131145507.107|20110131145508.944|TR0|will of the people. The people 
20110131145508.944|20110131145510.780|TR0|govern themselves. So, really, 
20110131145510.780|20110131145512.616|TR0|we are happy.
20110131145512.616|20110131145514.453|TR0|
20110131145514.453|20110131145516.289|TR0|But what I would like to tell 
20110131145516.289|20110131145518.125|TR0|you, the U.S. government, with 
20110131145518.125|20110131145519.962|TR0|Israel and Saudi Arabia and some 
20110131145519.962|20110131145521.798|TR0|other powers outside the country 
20110131145521.798|20110131145523.635|TR0|and inside the country, they 
20110131145523.635|20110131145525.471|TR0|want to abort this revolution. 
20110131145525.471|20110131145527.307|TR0|And they are creating rumors 
20110131145527.307|20110131145529.144|TR0|that, you know, Egypt is going 
20110131145529.144|20110131145530.980|TR0|to be ruined, to be robbed, and 
20110131145530.980|20110131145532.816|TR0|they are also preventing - we 
20110131145532.816|20110131145534.653|TR0|don't have bread now, and the 
20110131145534.653|20110131145536.489|TR0|shops are using this to raise 
20110131145536.489|20110131145538.326|TR0|the price. So they are trying to 
20110131145538.326|20110131145540.162|TR0|frighten us. They have two 
20110131145540.162|20110131145541.998|TR0|strategies: to frighten the 
20110131145541.998|20110131145543.835|TR0|people, so we say, "Oh, we need 
20110131145543.835|20110131145545.671|TR0|security, we need Mubarak," 
20110131145545.671|20110131145547.507|TR0|because people are living in 
20110131145547.507|20110131145549.344|TR0|fear. But when I go to the 
20110131145549.344|20110131145551.180|TR0|streets, there are no fear, you 
20110131145551.180|20110131145553.016|TR0|know, but when I stay at home 
20110131145553.016|20110131145554.853|TR0|and listen to the media, I feel, 
20110131145554.853|20110131145556.689|TR0|"What's going to happen?" But 
20110131145556.689|20110131145558.526|TR0|when I go to the streets, to 
20110131145558.526|20110131145600.362|TR0|Midan Tahrir, and see the 
20110131145600.362|20110131145602.198|TR0|people, the young people, the 
20110131145602.198|20110131145604.035|TR0|old people, the men, I feel 
20110131145604.035|20110131145605.871|TR0|secure, and I believe that the 
20110131145605.871|20110131145607.707|TR0|revolution succeeded. So, they 
20110131145607.707|20110131145609.544|TR0|are trying to abort the power 
20110131145609.544|20110131145611.380|TR0|outside and inside. But we will 
20110131145611.380|20110131145613.217|TR0|win.

20110131145615.053|20110131145616.889|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And Nawal El 
20110131145616.889|20110131145618.726|TR0|Saadawi, you often hear in the 
20110131145618.726|20110131145620.562|TR0|United States, "Is this going to 
20110131145620.562|20110131145622.398|TR0|be like the Iranian Revolution?" 
20110131145622.398|20110131145624.235|TR0|not talking about throwing out 
20110131145624.235|20110131145626.071|TR0|the dictator so much, but a 
20110131145626.071|20110131145627.908|TR0|fundamentalist revolution. Your 
20110131145627.908|20110131145629.744|TR0|response? Nawal?
20110131145629.744|20110131145631.580|TR0|
20110131145631.580|20110131145633.417|TR0|>> NAWAL EL SAADAWI: They are 
20110131145633.417|20110131145635.253|TR0|frightening us by the Ikhwan 
20110131145635.253|20110131145637.089|TR0|Muslimin, and that if Mubarak  
20110131145637.089|20110131145638.926|TR0|--  they tried for years to tell 
20110131145638.926|20110131145640.762|TR0|us that "Who protects us from 
20110131145640.762|20110131145642.599|TR0|the fundamentalists, like 
20110131145642.599|20110131145644.435|TR0|Khomeini and Iraq? It's 
20110131145644.435|20110131145646.271|TR0|Mubarak." You know, and this is 
20110131145646.271|20110131145648.108|TR0|not true. This revolution, the 
20110131145648.108|20110131145649.944|TR0|young people who started the 
20110131145649.944|20110131145651.780|TR0|revolution and who are 
20110131145651.780|20110131145653.617|TR0|continuing to protect it, they 
20110131145653.617|20110131145655.453|TR0|are not political, ordinary 
20110131145655.453|20110131145657.290|TR0|young men and women. They don't 
20110131145657.290|20110131145659.126|TR0|belong to the right or the left, 
20110131145659.126|20110131145700.962|TR0|or Muslim. There was not a 
20110131145700.962|20110131145702.799|TR0|single Islamic religious slogan 
20110131145702.799|20110131145704.635|TR0|in the streets. Not one. They 
20110131145704.635|20110131145706.471|TR0|were shouting for justice, 
20110131145706.471|20110131145708.308|TR0|equality, freedom, and that 
20110131145708.308|20110131145710.144|TR0|Mubarak and his regime should 
20110131145710.144|20110131145711.981|TR0|go, and we need to change the 
20110131145711.981|20110131145713.817|TR0|system and bring people who are 
20110131145713.817|20110131145715.653|TR0|honest. Egypt is living in 
20110131145715.653|20110131145717.490|TR0|corruption, false elections, 
20110131145717.490|20110131145719.326|TR0|oppression of women, of young 
20110131145719.326|20110131145721.162|TR0|people, unemployment. So the 
20110131145721.162|20110131145722.999|TR0|revolution came, it was too 
20110131145722.999|20110131145724.835|TR0|late. This revolution is too 
20110131145724.835|20110131145726.672|TR0|late, but anyway, it came. So  --

20110131145741.363|20110131145743.199|TR0|I came out from prison with bars
