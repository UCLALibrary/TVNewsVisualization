20110131075614.000|20110131075615.000|CC1|>> WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT
20110131075615.000|20110131075616.000|CC1|HOW NASA OPERATED?              
20110131075616.000|20110131075617.000|CC1|>> THE "COLUMBIA" INVESTIGATION

20110131075637.000|20110131075643.000|CC1|WAY, SACRIFICED ON THE ALTAR.   
20110131075643.000|20110131075645.000|CC1|THE FOAM HIT COMING OFF THE

20110131075648.000|20110131075650.000|CC1|THE MANAGERS WERE TASKED TO LET

20110131075654.000|20110131075657.000|CC1|HOW BAD IS THIS HIT?            
20110131075657.000|20110131075658.000|CC1|THEY WILL ACTUALLY PUT IN A

20110131075700.000|20110131075701.000|CC1|UNDERBELLY OF THE WING, AND IF  
20110131075701.000|20110131075702.000|CC1|THEY HAD DONE THAT, THEY WOULD  
20110131075702.000|20110131075703.000|CC1|HAVE FOUND A HOLE LARGE ENOUGH  
20110131075703.000|20110131075705.000|CC1|TO PUT YOUR HEAD THROUGH BUT    
20110131075705.000|20110131075706.000|CC1|THAT REQUEST WAS OVERTURNED BY  
20110131075706.000|20110131075707.000|CC1|MANAGERS WHO SIMPLY DECLARED IF 
20110131075707.000|20110131075708.000|CC1|IT'S REALLY THAT BAD, THERE'S   
20110131075708.000|20110131075709.000|CC1|NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT, AND 
20110131075709.000|20110131075710.000|CC1|THAT TURNED OFF THE REQUEST.    
20110131075710.000|20110131075716.000|CC1|>> THE ORBITER WAS LARGELY

20110131075717.000|20110131075718.000|CC1|ROCKWELL, CORRECT?              
20110131075718.000|20110131075718.000|CC1|>> THAT'S CORRECT.              
20110131075718.000|20110131075719.000|CC1|ROCKWELL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

20110131075720.000|20110131075721.000|CC1|>> NOW, THERE WERE CERTAINLY    
20110131075721.000|20110131075723.000|CC1|GREAT INTROSPECTION ON THE PART 
20110131075723.000|20110131075724.000|CC1|OF INDUSTRY.                    
20110131075724.000|20110131075725.000|CC1|>> RIGHT.                       
20110131075725.000|20110131075726.000|CC1|>> BUT IN TERMS OF THE          
20110131075726.000|20110131075727.000|CC1|GOVERNMENT, NASA, WHAT DID YOU  
20110131075727.000|20110131075728.000|CC1|FIND?                           
20110131075728.000|20110131075729.000|CC1|>> WELL, IT'S -- I THINK NASA   
20110131075729.000|20110131075730.000|CC1|ALWAYS WENT INTO DUCK-AND-COVER 
20110131075730.000|20110131075731.000|CC1|MODE RIGHT AFTER THE DISASTER   
20110131075731.000|20110131075734.000|CC1|AND IN SOME WAYS THEY DID LEARN 
20110131075734.000|20110131075735.000|CC1|A LOT, DID CHANGE SOME THINGS.  
20110131075735.000|20110131075737.000|CC1|FOR EXAMPLE, THEY PUT AN        
20110131075737.000|20110131075738.000|CC1|ASTRONAUT ON THE TOP OF THE     
20110131075738.000|20110131075742.000|CC1|LAUNCH DECISION CHAIN WHICH WAS 
20110131075742.000|20110131075744.000|CC1|UNPRECEDENTED, BUT THE          
20110131075744.000|20110131075745.000|CC1|TRADITIONAL CULTURE OF SAFETY   
20110131075745.000|20110131075746.000|CC1|FIRST, THAT CAME BACK TO SOME   
20110131075746.000|20110131075748.000|CC1|EXTENT, BUT IT WAS OVERRULED    
20110131075748.000|20110131075749.000|CC1|WHEN A FORMER BUDGET DIRECTOR   
20110131075749.000|20110131075751.000|CC1|WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF NASA AND   
20110131075751.000|20110131075751.000|CC1|WAS PUSHING FOR THE ACCELERATION
20110131075751.000|20110131075752.000|CC1|ONCE AGAIN OF FLIGHTS, FLIGHTS  
20110131075752.000|20110131075753.000|CC1|IN THE ERA THAT BROUGHT

20110131075802.000|20110131075803.000|CC1|WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM TO TAKE

20110131075805.000|20110131075806.000|CC1|>> WELL, WHAT THEY DISCOVER, I  
20110131075806.000|20110131075809.000|CC1|DON'T TELL THEM SO MUCH, BUT    
20110131075809.000|20110131075814.000|CC1|THEY DISCOVER THIS.             
20110131075814.000|20110131075816.000|CC1|WHAT THEY DISCOVER WHEN THEY    
20110131075816.000|20110131075818.000|CC1|STUDY THE "CHALLENGER" SCENARIO 
20110131075818.000|20110131075821.000|CC1|AND "COLUMBIA" AS A FOLLOW-ON,  
20110131075821.000|20110131075822.000|CC1|NUMBER ONE, IT'S REALLY         
20110131075822.000|20110131075823.000|CC1|IMPORTANT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AS 
20110131075823.000|20110131075824.000|CC1|YOU SEE IT, BUT IT'S ALSO VERY  
20110131075824.000|20110131075825.000|CC1|DIFFICULT TO DO SO WHEN YOU'RE A
20110131075825.000|20110131075826.000|CC1|LOWER LEVEL POSITION.           
20110131075826.000|20110131075827.000|CC1|ALL OF THESE YOUNGSTERS WILL    
20110131075827.000|20110131075828.000|CC1|SOME DAY BE IN A HIGHER

20110131075829.000|20110131075831.000|CC1|THEY WILL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 
20110131075831.000|20110131075833.000|CC1|WHEN THEY ARE IN A HIGH LEVEL   
20110131075833.000|20110131075836.000|CC1|POSITION AS AL McDONALD TOLD

20110131075837.000|20110131075838.000|CC1|NEED TO CREATE A CULTURE THAT

20110131075843.000|20110131075843.000|CC1|SPEAK IT FREELY.                
20110131075843.000|20110131075844.000|CC1|THAT'S INCUMBENT ON LEADERS.    
20110131075844.000|20110131075845.000|CC1|>> DOES THAT CULTURE IN BUSINESS
20110131075845.000|20110131075846.000|CC1|EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE   
20110131075846.000|20110131075847.000|CC1|THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT IN     
20110131075847.000|20110131075848.000|CC1|PLACES LIKE JAPAN THEY DO LISTEN
20110131075848.000|20110131075849.000|CC1|TO THE PERSON ON THE FLOOR OF   
20110131075849.000|20110131075850.000|CC1|THE FACTORY?                    
20110131075850.000|20110131075850.000|CC1|>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION      
20110131075850.000|20110131075851.000|CC1|BECAUSE ABSOLUTELY IT DOES      
20110131075851.000|20110131075853.000|CC1|EXIST.                          
20110131075853.000|20110131075853.000|CC1|SADLY IT DIDN'T EXIST IN MANY   
20110131075853.000|20110131075854.000|CC1|PROMINENT CASES LIKE ENRON,     
20110131075854.000|20110131075856.000|CC1|LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, EVEN THE     
20110131075856.000|20110131075857.000|CC1|COUNTRYWIDE MORTGAGE MELTDOWN.

20110131075904.000|20110131075906.000|CC1|MANY ORGANIZATIONS.             
20110131075906.000|20110131075907.000|CC1|IN FACT, I WOULD ARGUE MANY OF
