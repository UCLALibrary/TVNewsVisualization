20110109030007.000|20110109030009.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm CNN's Wolf 
20110109030009.000|20110109030011.000|TR0|Blitzer.  We're here in Washington.  We're 
20110109030011.000|20110109030014.000|TR0|following dramatic developments in Tucson, 
20110109030014.000|20110109030016.000|TR0|Arizona. A killing spree earlier in the 
20110109030016.000|20110109030019.000|TR0|day.  We're  following the breaking news.  
20110109030019.000|20110109030021.000|TR0|We're not leaving this story.
20110109030021.000|20110109030023.000|TR0|
20110109030023.000|20110109030026.000|TR0|DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  All right.  Wolf 
20110109030026.000|20110109030028.000|TR0|Blitzer, thank you. Wolf, stick around.  
20110109030028.000|20110109030031.000|TR0|We're going to need your help during our 
20110109030031.000|20110109030033.000|TR0|coverage.  I'm Don Lemon in at the CNN 
20110109030033.000|20110109030035.000|TR0|mall headquarters in Atlanta. 
20110109030035.000|20110109030038.000|TR0|Investigators in Arizona right  now are 
20110109030038.000|20110109030040.000|TR0|aggressively searching for a second person 
20110109030040.000|20110109030043.000|TR0|in today's mass shooting at a supermarket, 
20110109030043.000|20110109030045.000|TR0|killing a federal judge and critically 
20110109030045.000|20110109030047.000|TR0|wounding a U.S. congresswoman.
20110109030047.000|20110109030050.000|TR0|
20110109030050.000|20110109030052.000|TR0|Democratic representative, Gabrielle 
20110109030052.000|20110109030055.000|TR0|"Gabby" Giffords was meeting with 
20110109030055.000|20110109030057.000|TR0|constituents about noon eastern time, 
20110109030057.000|20110109030059.000|TR0|10:00 A.M. local time, when a gunman 
20110109030059.000|20110109030102.000|TR0|stepped up and began firing at very close 
20110109030102.000|20110109030104.000|TR0|range.  Now despite a bullet passing 
20110109030104.000|20110109030107.000|TR0|through Giffords' brain -- Giffords' 
20110109030107.000|20110109030109.000|TR0|brain, doctors believe that she will 
20110109030109.000|20110109030111.000|TR0|survive this.
20110109030111.000|20110109030114.000|TR0|
20110109030114.000|20110109030116.000|TR0|Six others, however, were not so lucky.  
20110109030116.000|20110109030119.000|TR0|Among them, Federal Judge John M. Roll, 
20110109030119.000|20110109030121.000|TR0|who was about to mark his 20th year on the 
20110109030121.000|20110109030123.000|TR0|bench. Sheriff Clarence Dupnik says Roll 
20110109030123.000|20110109030126.000|TR0|had just attended mass nearby and stopped 
20110109030126.000|20110109030128.000|TR0|by to say hello to Giffords.  The sheriff 
20110109030128.000|20110109030131.000|TR0|said it appeared the gunman was targeting 
20110109030131.000|20110109030133.000|TR0|Giffords and that the judge was simply in 
20110109030133.000|20110109030135.000|TR0|the wrong place at the wrong time.
20110109030135.000|20110109030138.000|TR0|
20110109030138.000|20110109030140.000|TR0|Twelve people, including the 
20110109030140.000|20110109030143.000|TR0|congresswoman, were wounded in that 
20110109030143.000|20110109030145.000|TR0|attack.  Now bystanders tackled the 
20110109030145.000|20110109030147.000|TR0|alleged gunman.  He has been identified as 
20110109030147.000|20110109030150.000|TR0|22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner.  A nine 
20110109030150.000|20110109030152.000|TR0|millimeter handgun was recovered.  A 
20110109030152.000|20110109030155.000|TR0|second individual is now being sought as a 
20110109030155.000|20110109030157.000|TR0|person of interest.
20110109030157.000|20110109030159.000|TR0|
20110109030159.000|20110109030202.000|TR0|Listen to this.

20110109030209.000|20110109030211.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  We're not convinced that he acted 
20110109030211.000|20110109030214.000|TR0|alone.  There is some reason to believe 
20110109030214.000|20110109030216.000|TR0|that he came to this location with another 
20110109030216.000|20110109030219.000|TR0|individual.  And there's reason to believe 
20110109030219.000|20110109030221.000|TR0|that the other individual in some way be 
20110109030221.000|20110109030223.000|TR0|involved.

20110109030231.000|20110109030233.000|TR0|LEMON:  We want to go right to CNN's Ted 
20110109030233.000|20110109030235.000|TR0|Rowlands.  He is in Tucson outside of the 
20110109030235.000|20110109030238.000|TR0|hospital.  Ted, you're hearing stories.  I 
20110109030238.000|20110109030240.000|TR0|just heard you speak with people who are 
20110109030240.000|20110109030243.000|TR0|there and are waiting to hear about their 
20110109030243.000|20110109030245.000|TR0|loved ones and people who had -- but there 
20110109030245.000|20110109030247.000|TR0|were victims of this crime.
20110109030247.000|20110109030250.000|TR0|
20110109030250.000|20110109030252.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, 
20110109030252.000|20110109030255.000|TR0|Don, the scene here, as you might imagine, 
20110109030255.000|20110109030257.000|TR0|is -- is a lot of different emotions, a 
20110109030257.000|20110109030259.000|TR0|lot of people are very somber.  There is a 
20110109030259.000|20110109030302.000|TR0|candlelight vigil outside the hospital.  
20110109030302.000|20110109030304.000|TR0|Inside the hospital, there are a lot of 
20110109030304.000|20110109030307.000|TR0|people that are desperate for news -- 
20110109030307.000|20110109030309.000|TR0|desperate for good news, inside the 
20110109030309.000|20110109030311.000|TR0|hospital.
20110109030311.000|20110109030314.000|TR0|
20110109030314.000|20110109030316.000|TR0|One of the folks that is injured -- there 
20110109030316.000|20110109030319.000|TR0|are 10 of them in total at this facility 
20110109030319.000|20110109030321.000|TR0|-- is the congresswoman.  She is out of 
20110109030321.000|20110109030323.000|TR0|surgery.  She was responding to commands 
20110109030323.000|20110109030326.000|TR0|after surgery.  Doctors here say that is a 
20110109030326.000|20110109030328.000|TR0|great sign.  They are very optimistic 
20110109030328.000|20110109030331.000|TR0|about her recovery.  However, with a -- a 
20110109030331.000|20110109030333.000|TR0|brain injury, she suffered one gunshot 
20110109030333.000|20110109030335.000|TR0|that went through her head, in one side, 
20110109030335.000|20110109030338.000|TR0|out the other, went through her brain. 
20110109030338.000|20110109030340.000|TR0|Swelling is a -- a huge potential problem 
20110109030340.000|20110109030343.000|TR0|being monitored in the IC unit as we speak.
20110109030343.000|20110109030345.000|TR0|
20110109030345.000|20110109030347.000|TR0|Her husband is there, and her parents are 
20110109030347.000|20110109030350.000|TR0|there.  One of the folks that has also 
20110109030350.000|20110109030352.000|TR0|been in the hospital throughout the day is 
20110109030352.000|20110109030355.000|TR0|Steve Farley.  He holds her old state seat 
20110109030355.000|20110109030357.000|TR0|here in Arizona.  And you've been with the 
20110109030357.000|20110109030359.000|TR0|family -- with supporters.  Give us first 
20110109030359.000|20110109030402.000|TR0|the -- what you've -- what you've been 
20110109030402.000|20110109030404.000|TR0|hearing about her condition, again, and -- 
20110109030404.000|20110109030407.000|TR0|and set the scene inside that hospital for 
20110109030407.000|20110109030409.000|TR0|us.
20110109030409.000|20110109030411.000|TR0|
20110109030411.000|20110109030414.000|TR0|STEVE FARLEY:  Well, we're -- we're very 
20110109030414.000|20110109030416.000|TR0|optimistic.  We know that she's a fighter. 
20110109030416.000|20110109030419.000|TR0| Certainly he last campaign proved that 
20110109030419.000|20110109030421.000|TR0|she's a fighter, and we believe she can 
20110109030421.000|20110109030423.000|TR0|come through this with flying colors. In 
20110109030423.000|20110109030426.000|TR0|the hospital, there's a -- a lot of family 
20110109030426.000|20110109030428.000|TR0|members of all the different people who 
20110109030428.000|20110109030431.000|TR0|have been injured, in some case, killed 
20110109030431.000|20110109030433.000|TR0|here. And a lot of what's happening is 
20110109030433.000|20110109030435.000|TR0|we're giving each other support, a lot of 
20110109030435.000|20110109030438.000|TR0|hugging, a lot of quiet contemplation, a 
20110109030438.000|20110109030440.000|TR0|lot of thinking about what this means for 
20110109030440.000|20110109030443.000|TR0|us and our future.  And -- and it's -- 
20110109030443.000|20110109030445.000|TR0|it's about really taking care of those 
20110109030445.000|20110109030447.000|TR0|people that need to be taken care of right 
20110109030447.000|20110109030450.000|TR0|now.
20110109030450.000|20110109030452.000|TR0|
20110109030452.000|20110109030455.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  You have a very complex 
20110109030455.000|20110109030457.000|TR0|situation where the congresswoman 
20110109030457.000|20110109030459.000|TR0|obviously is fighting for her life.  Her 
20110109030459.000|20110109030502.000|TR0|chief of staff injured as well, went 
20110109030502.000|20110109030504.000|TR0|through surgery also in -- in the ICU unit 
20110109030504.000|20110109030507.000|TR0|trying to recover.  And you had another 
20110109030507.000|20110109030509.000|TR0|staffer who died.  A young man that was 
20110109030509.000|20110109030511.000|TR0|killed at -- at the scene.  Give us a 
20110109030511.000|20110109030514.000|TR0|sense of what the people close to the 
20110109030514.000|20110109030516.000|TR0|congresswoman are going through right now 
20110109030516.000|20110109030519.000|TR0|given all of the complexities of the 
20110109030519.000|20110109030521.000|TR0|emotions.
20110109030521.000|20110109030523.000|TR0|
20110109030523.000|20110109030526.000|TR0|FARLEY:  It's been very tough.  I mean, we 
20110109030526.000|20110109030528.000|TR0|-- when we were in there this morning, it 
20110109030528.000|20110109030531.000|TR0|was like a bubble of truth in which we 
20110109030531.000|20110109030533.000|TR0|knew the truth about the conditions of 
20110109030533.000|20110109030535.000|TR0|people but we kept hearing rumors from the 
20110109030535.000|20110109030538.000|TR0|outside of people texting us and saying, 
20110109030538.000|20110109030540.000|TR0|for instance, that the congresswoman had 
20110109030540.000|20110109030543.000|TR0|died.  And it was very disturbing for the 
20110109030543.000|20110109030545.000|TR0|family. And -- and that -- that was -- 
20110109030545.000|20110109030547.000|TR0|that was very difficult at the time. And 
20110109030547.000|20110109030550.000|TR0|we knew the truth.  We even started 
20110109030550.000|20110109030552.000|TR0|doubting ourselves.
20110109030552.000|20110109030555.000|TR0|
20110109030555.000|20110109030557.000|TR0|And -- are coming in and saying we heard 
20110109030557.000|20110109030559.000|TR0|this stuff all over. But it -- it -- it's 
20110109030559.000|20110109030602.000|TR0|hard.  What -- the thing that really comes 
20110109030602.000|20110109030604.000|TR0|over and above this is this spirit of love 
20110109030604.000|20110109030607.000|TR0|that's coming from people.  And it's 
20110109030607.000|20110109030609.000|TR0|people inside and people outside.  And 
20110109030609.000|20110109030611.000|TR0|we've had this vigil here on the lawn in 
20110109030611.000|20110109030614.000|TR0|front of the...
20110109030614.000|20110109030616.000|TR0|
20110109030616.000|20110109030619.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Which has been growing 
20110109030619.000|20110109030621.000|TR0|throughout the day, and -- and really...
20110109030621.000|20110109030623.000|TR0|
20110109030623.000|20110109030626.000|TR0|FARLEY:  It's been growing and I think it 
20110109030626.000|20110109030628.000|TR0|will continue happening as people hear 
20110109030628.000|20110109030631.000|TR0|about it because there is -- Gabby is the 
20110109030631.000|20110109030633.000|TR0|sort of person who inspired love and hope 
20110109030633.000|20110109030635.000|TR0|in all those around her.  And what I was 
20110109030635.000|20110109030638.000|TR0|telling the crowd was that you can't stop 
20110109030638.000|20110109030640.000|TR0|hope with a bullet.  You can't stop love 
20110109030640.000|20110109030643.000|TR0|with a bullet.  And I think the people of 
20110109030643.000|20110109030645.000|TR0|Tucson and the people of Arizona will rise 
20110109030645.000|20110109030647.000|TR0|above this.
20110109030647.000|20110109030650.000|TR0|
20110109030650.000|20110109030652.000|TR0|We are not like this as a people, here or 
20110109030652.000|20110109030655.000|TR0|in the rest of the country.
20110109030655.000|20110109030657.000|TR0|
20110109030657.000|20110109030659.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Your campaign manager was at 
20110109030659.000|20110109030702.000|TR0|the scene of the time of the shooting.  He 
20110109030702.000|20110109030704.000|TR0|also is a nurse and you say he -- he may 
20110109030704.000|20110109030707.000|TR0|have helped save her life.  Explain what 
20110109030707.000|20110109030709.000|TR0|he did and when you saw him, he apparently 
20110109030709.000|20110109030711.000|TR0|was covered in blood.  What happened?
20110109030711.000|20110109030714.000|TR0|
20110109030714.000|20110109030716.000|TR0|FARLEY:  He was staffing that event.  He 
20110109030716.000|20110109030719.000|TR0|was in the back of the room.  The shots 
20110109030719.000|20110109030721.000|TR0|rang out in the front of the room.  He -- 
20110109030721.000|20110109030723.000|TR0|he had said actually that he was giving 
20110109030723.000|20110109030726.000|TR0|out clipboards to people.  One person took 
20110109030726.000|20110109030728.000|TR0|it with a very angry, strange, brusque 
20110109030728.000|20110109030731.000|TR0|way.  And he later saw that person running 
20110109030731.000|20110109030733.000|TR0|away.  So he -- he kind of knew what 
20110109030733.000|20110109030735.000|TR0|happened.  There were people all over on 
20110109030735.000|20110109030738.000|TR0|the floor.  And he went to Gabby's side 
20110109030738.000|20110109030740.000|TR0|and kept pressure on the wound, kept her 
20110109030740.000|20110109030743.000|TR0|talking and active until the ambulance 
20110109030743.000|20110109030745.000|TR0|came about ten minutes later.  And then 
20110109030745.000|20110109030747.000|TR0|rode with her to the hospital and helped 
20110109030747.000|20110109030750.000|TR0|them out along the way in the hospital.
20110109030750.000|20110109030752.000|TR0|
20110109030752.000|20110109030755.000|TR0|And I really think he is a hero who -- who 
20110109030755.000|20110109030757.000|TR0|in many ways saved her life.
20110109030757.000|20110109030759.000|TR0|
20110109030759.000|20110109030802.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Her parents are here.  Her 
20110109030802.000|20110109030804.000|TR0|husband, Mark Kelly, who is an -- a NASA 
20110109030804.000|20110109030807.000|TR0|astronaut, flew from Houston.  He 
20110109030807.000|20110109030809.000|TR0|apparently is also here at her side?
20110109030809.000|20110109030811.000|TR0|
20110109030811.000|20110109030814.000|TR0|FARLEY:  Yes.  He is here.  He got here 
20110109030814.000|20110109030816.000|TR0|mid-afternoon.  So he's here by her side 
20110109030816.000|20110109030819.000|TR0|as well.
20110109030819.000|20110109030821.000|TR0|
20110109030821.000|20110109030823.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  When will you hear an update 
20110109030823.000|20110109030826.000|TR0|and -- and what are the next 24 hours -- 
20110109030826.000|20110109030828.000|TR0|24 to 48 hours entail for her and her 
20110109030828.000|20110109030831.000|TR0|struggle?
20110109030831.000|20110109030833.000|TR0|
20110109030833.000|20110109030835.000|TR0|FARLEY:  Well this type of surgery 
20110109030835.000|20110109030838.000|TR0|obviously takes a while to recover from.  
20110109030838.000|20110109030840.000|TR0|And then it's a while before you find out 
20110109030840.000|20110109030843.000|TR0|details about the prognosis.  But the 
20110109030843.000|20110109030845.000|TR0|surgeon is very optimistic about this, 
20110109030845.000|20110109030847.000|TR0|being able to be a recovery that is -- 
20110109030847.000|20110109030850.000|TR0|that is a good one.  So we'll find out.  
20110109030850.000|20110109030852.000|TR0|There will be different -- there's 
20110109030852.000|20110109030855.000|TR0|different things we'll probably hear 
20110109030855.000|20110109030857.000|TR0|during the night.  But I'm -- I'm really 
20110109030857.000|20110109030859.000|TR0|optimistic that Gabby is a fighter and 
20110109030859.000|20110109030902.000|TR0|she's going to fight through this one for 
20110109030902.000|20110109030904.000|TR0|herself and for all of us.
20110109030904.000|20110109030907.000|TR0|
20110109030907.000|20110109030909.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Steve Farley, thanks for your 
20110109030909.000|20110109030911.000|TR0|insight on what is happening inside that 
20110109030911.000|20110109030914.000|TR0|hospital.
20110109030914.000|20110109030916.000|TR0|
20110109030916.000|20110109030919.000|TR0|Don, this is the same facility where that 
20110109030919.000|20110109030921.000|TR0|9-year-old girl was brought immediately 
20110109030921.000|20110109030923.000|TR0|after the shooting and pronounced dead.  
20110109030923.000|20110109030926.000|TR0|So as you can imagine, a lot of pain 
20110109030926.000|20110109030928.000|TR0|inside and a lot of hope outside here at 
20110109030928.000|20110109030931.000|TR0|this vigil, hoping that the folks that are 
20110109030931.000|20110109030933.000|TR0|still injured will recover.
20110109030933.000|20110109030935.000|TR0|
20110109030935.000|20110109030938.000|TR0|LEMON:  Sad to say, but the reality -- it 
20110109030938.000|20110109030940.000|TR0|is just beginning. Thank you, Ted 
20110109030940.000|20110109030943.000|TR0|Rowlands.  Stand by.  We'll be getting 
20110109030943.000|20110109030945.000|TR0|back to you.
20110109030945.000|20110109030947.000|TR0|
20110109030947.000|20110109030950.000|TR0|I want to go back to Washington now and 
20110109030950.000|20110109030952.000|TR0|CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Wolf, even the 
20110109030952.000|20110109030955.000|TR0|president weighing in on this today.
20110109030955.000|20110109030957.000|TR0|
20110109030957.000|20110109030959.000|TR0|BLITZER:  It -- it really has outraged 
20110109030959.000|20110109031002.000|TR0|everyone from the president and the vice 
20110109031002.000|20110109031004.000|TR0|president on down.  Everyone in 
20110109031004.000|20110109031007.000|TR0|Washington, all the important Democrats, 
20110109031007.000|20110109031009.000|TR0|for sure, and many of the Republicans, 
20110109031009.000|20110109031011.000|TR0|they're all weighing in.  They're 
20110109031011.000|20110109031014.000|TR0|expressing their outrage.
20110109031014.000|20110109031016.000|TR0|
20110109031016.000|20110109031019.000|TR0|She was really beloved here in Washington. 
20110109031019.000|20110109031021.000|TR0| Still is -- Gabrielle Giffords. Everyone 
20110109031021.000|20110109031023.000|TR0|seemed to -- to know her as a fighter and 
20110109031023.000|20110109031026.000|TR0|she's fighting right now for her life.  
20110109031026.000|20110109031028.000|TR0|Earlier, the president made a point of 
20110109031028.000|20110109031031.000|TR0|coming out and speaking to the American 
20110109031031.000|20110109031033.000|TR0|people.
20110109031033.000|20110109031035.000|TR0|
20110109031035.000|20110109031038.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110109031038.000|20110109031040.000|TR0|
20110109031040.000|20110109031043.000|TR0|PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  As many of you 
20110109031043.000|20110109031045.000|TR0|are aware, earlier today, a number of 
20110109031045.000|20110109031047.000|TR0|people were shot in Tucson, Arizona, 
20110109031047.000|20110109031050.000|TR0|including several who were meeting at a 
20110109031050.000|20110109031052.000|TR0|supermarket with their congresswoman, 
20110109031052.000|20110109031055.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.  We are still 
20110109031055.000|20110109031057.000|TR0|assembling all the facts.  But we know 
20110109031057.000|20110109031059.000|TR0|that representative Giffords was one of 
20110109031059.000|20110109031102.000|TR0|the victims.  She is currently at a 
20110109031102.000|20110109031104.000|TR0|hospital in the area.  And she is battling 
20110109031104.000|20110109031107.000|TR0|for her life.
20110109031107.000|20110109031109.000|TR0|
20110109031109.000|20110109031111.000|TR0|We also know that at least five people 
20110109031111.000|20110109031114.000|TR0|lost their lives in this tragedy.  Among 
20110109031114.000|20110109031116.000|TR0|them were a federal judge, John Roll, who 
20110109031116.000|20110109031119.000|TR0|has served America's legal system for 
20110109031119.000|20110109031121.000|TR0|almost 40 years, and a young girl who was 
20110109031121.000|20110109031123.000|TR0|barely 9 years old.
20110109031123.000|20110109031126.000|TR0|
20110109031126.000|20110109031128.000|TR0|I've spoken to Arizona Governor, Jan 
20110109031128.000|20110109031131.000|TR0|Brewer and offered the full resources of 
20110109031131.000|20110109031133.000|TR0|the federal government.  A suspect is 
20110109031133.000|20110109031135.000|TR0|currently in custody but we don't yet know 
20110109031135.000|20110109031138.000|TR0|what provoked this unspeakable act.  A 
20110109031138.000|20110109031140.000|TR0|comprehensive investigation is currently 
20110109031140.000|20110109031143.000|TR0|under way.  And at my direction, Director 
20110109031143.000|20110109031145.000|TR0|Bob Mueller is en route to Arizona to help 
20110109031145.000|20110109031147.000|TR0|coordinate these efforts.
20110109031147.000|20110109031150.000|TR0|
20110109031150.000|20110109031152.000|TR0|I've also spoken to the Democratic and 
20110109031152.000|20110109031155.000|TR0|Republican leaders in the house.  Gabby 
20110109031155.000|20110109031157.000|TR0|Giffords was a friend of mine.  She is not 
20110109031157.000|20110109031159.000|TR0|only an extraordinary public servant, but 
20110109031159.000|20110109031202.000|TR0|she is also somebody who is warm and 
20110109031202.000|20110109031204.000|TR0|caring.  She is well-liked by her 
20110109031204.000|20110109031207.000|TR0|colleagues and well-liked by her 
20110109031207.000|20110109031209.000|TR0|constituents.  Her husband, Mark Kelly, is 
20110109031209.000|20110109031211.000|TR0|a navy captain and one of America's 
20110109031211.000|20110109031214.000|TR0|valiant astronauts.  It's not surprising 
20110109031214.000|20110109031216.000|TR0|that today Gabby was doing what she always 
20110109031216.000|20110109031219.000|TR0|does -- listening to the hopes and 
20110109031219.000|20110109031221.000|TR0|concerns of her neighbors.  That is the 
20110109031221.000|20110109031223.000|TR0|essence of what our democracy is all about.
20110109031223.000|20110109031226.000|TR0|
20110109031226.000|20110109031228.000|TR0|That is why this is more than a tragedy 
20110109031228.000|20110109031231.000|TR0|for those involved.  It is a tragedy for 
20110109031231.000|20110109031233.000|TR0|Arizona, and a tragedy for our entire 
20110109031233.000|20110109031235.000|TR0|country.  What Americans do at times of 
20110109031235.000|20110109031238.000|TR0|tragedy is to come together and support 
20110109031238.000|20110109031240.000|TR0|each other.  And so at this time, I ask 
20110109031240.000|20110109031243.000|TR0|all Americans to join me and Michelle in 
20110109031243.000|20110109031245.000|TR0|keeping all the victims and their 
20110109031245.000|20110109031247.000|TR0|families, including Gabby, in our thoughts 
20110109031247.000|20110109031250.000|TR0|and prayers.
20110109031250.000|20110109031252.000|TR0|
20110109031252.000|20110109031255.000|TR0|Those who have been injured, we are 
20110109031255.000|20110109031257.000|TR0|rooting for them.  And I know Gabby is as 
20110109031257.000|20110109031259.000|TR0|tough as they come.  And I am hopeful that 
20110109031259.000|20110109031302.000|TR0|she is going to pull through.  Obviously 
20110109031302.000|20110109031304.000|TR0|our hearts go out to the family members of 
20110109031304.000|20110109031307.000|TR0|those who -- who have been slain.  We are 
20110109031307.000|20110109031309.000|TR0|going to get to the bottom of this.  And 
20110109031309.000|20110109031311.000|TR0|we're going to get through this.  But in 
20110109031311.000|20110109031314.000|TR0|the meantime, I think all of us need to 
20110109031314.000|20110109031316.000|TR0|make sure that we're offering our thoughts 
20110109031316.000|20110109031319.000|TR0|and prayers to those concerned.
20110109031319.000|20110109031321.000|TR0|
20110109031321.000|20110109031323.000|TR0|Thank you.

20110109031345.000|20110109031347.000|TR0|ordering the Majority Leader, Eric Cantor, 
20110109031347.000|20110109031350.000|TR0|to announce that they're going to suspend,

20110109031402.000|20110109031404.000|TR0|because of what's happened out in Tucson.  
20110109031404.000|20110109031407.000|TR0|Representative Gabrielle Giffords is 
20110109031407.000|20110109031409.000|TR0|relatively new to the capitol but she's 
20110109031409.000|20110109031411.000|TR0|certainly no stranger to public service.  
20110109031411.000|20110109031414.000|TR0|We'll discuss who she is.  That's coming

20110109031440.000|20110109031443.000|TR0|LEMON:  Welcome back to our breaking news. 
20110109031443.000|20110109031445.000|TR0| Some background now on the young 
20110109031445.000|20110109031447.000|TR0|congresswoman who was the object of an 
20110109031447.000|20110109031450.000|TR0|assassination attempt today in Arizona.  
20110109031450.000|20110109031452.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords first went to Capital 
20110109031452.000|20110109031455.000|TR0|Hill in 2007.  The Democrats took control 
20110109031455.000|20110109031457.000|TR0|of both houses of Congress. Now before 
20110109031457.000|20110109031459.000|TR0|being elected to the House, she was a 
20110109031459.000|20110109031502.000|TR0|state representative in Arizona from 2001 
20110109031502.000|20110109031504.000|TR0|to 2003, and a state senator from 2003 to 
20110109031504.000|20110109031507.000|TR0|2005.
20110109031507.000|20110109031509.000|TR0|
20110109031509.000|20110109031511.000|TR0|When she won her state Senate seat at the 
20110109031511.000|20110109031514.000|TR0|age of 32, she was the youngest woman ever 
20110109031514.000|20110109031516.000|TR0|elected to the chamber.  But she didn't 
20110109031516.000|20110109031519.000|TR0|only excel at politics.  She earned a 
20110109031519.000|20110109031521.000|TR0|Fulbright to Mexico in 1996 and has a 
20110109031521.000|20110109031523.000|TR0|Masters in regional planning from Cornell 
20110109031523.000|20110109031526.000|TR0|University.  Her husband, Mark Kelly, is 
20110109031526.000|20110109031528.000|TR0|an astronaut.  They married in 2007.  
20110109031528.000|20110109031531.000|TR0|Kelly is going to be the commander of the 
20110109031531.000|20110109031533.000|TR0|final planned mission in the space shuttle 
20110109031533.000|20110109031535.000|TR0|program.  And Kelly's twin brother is also 
20110109031535.000|20110109031538.000|TR0|an astronaut who is right now on the  
20110109031538.000|20110109031540.000|TR0|international space station.

20110109031647.000|20110109031650.000|TR0|the marine wildlife that's being washed up 
20110109031650.000|20110109031652.000|TR0|onshore.  And to know that particularly 
20110109031652.000|20110109031655.000|TR0|during the spawning season that we may 
20110109031655.000|20110109031657.000|TR0|lose major parts of our Gulf Coast. It is 
20110109031657.000|20110109031659.000|TR0|-- it is really tragic.

20110109031702.000|20110109031704.000|TR0|Again, the accountability, the oversight, 
20110109031704.000|20110109031707.000|TR0|the investigation, all of that really 
20110109031707.000|20110109031709.000|TR0|matters.  But I think in the broader 
20110109031709.000|20110109031711.000|TR0|context, as we've been having very large 
20110109031711.000|20110109031714.000|TR0|discussions about -- about new types of 
20110109031714.000|20110109031716.000|TR0|energy, renewable energy, being able to 
20110109031716.000|20110109031719.000|TR0|pass legislation that transfers our 
20110109031719.000|20110109031721.000|TR0|dependency off of foreign oil and also 
20110109031721.000|20110109031723.000|TR0|hard-to-reach and find oil.  I really I

20110109031735.000|20110109031738.000|TR0|in May.  Arizona governor, Jan Brewer got

20110109031752.000|20110109031755.000|TR0|more than just a colleague, she is 
20110109031755.000|20110109031757.000|TR0|actually a friend.  She has always been a 
20110109031757.000|20110109031759.000|TR0|noble public servant and my thoughts and

20110109031828.000|20110109031831.000|TR0|representative Giffords here with us now.  
20110109031831.000|20110109031833.000|TR0|Doctor Matt Heinz is a state 
20110109031833.000|20110109031835.000|TR0|representative in Arizona.  He joins me 
20110109031835.000|20110109031838.000|TR0|now live from Tucson.
20110109031838.000|20110109031840.000|TR0|
20110109031840.000|20110109031843.000|TR0|Matt, you've been at the hospital, you 
20110109031843.000|20110109031845.000|TR0|have been speaking with friends.  Tell us 
20110109031845.000|20110109031847.000|TR0|what you are hearing there.
20110109031847.000|20110109031850.000|TR0|
20110109031850.000|20110109031852.000|TR0|DR. MATT HEINZ, ARIZONA STATE 
20110109031852.000|20110109031855.000|TR0|REPRESENTATIVE:  Hi, Don.
20110109031855.000|20110109031857.000|TR0|
20110109031857.000|20110109031859.000|TR0|I certainly wish the circumstances were 
20110109031859.000|20110109031902.000|TR0|different.  But, you know, I'm -- I think 
20110109031902.000|20110109031904.000|TR0|we're all thankful that -- that 
20110109031904.000|20110109031907.000|TR0|congresswoman Giffords is alive and is 
20110109031907.000|20110109031909.000|TR0|responding and has -- has made it through 
20110109031909.000|20110109031911.000|TR0|this terrible tragedy.  Of course...
20110109031911.000|20110109031914.000|TR0|
20110109031914.000|20110109031916.000|TR0|LEMON:  Now this -- you don't work at this 
20110109031916.000|20110109031919.000|TR0|hospital.  This -- this is a hospital in 
20110109031919.000|20110109031921.000|TR0|which -- which you were trained.  So you 
20110109031921.000|20110109031923.000|TR0|know a lot of the staff.  You're very 
20110109031923.000|20110109031926.000|TR0|familiar with the hospital.  Can you 
20110109031926.000|20110109031928.000|TR0|describe to us the scene inside the 
20110109031928.000|20110109031931.000|TR0|emergency room, inside the hospital with 
20110109031931.000|20110109031933.000|TR0|people coming in and out to try to figure 
20110109031933.000|20110109031935.000|TR0|out if their loved ones who are there are 
20110109031935.000|20110109031938.000|TR0|even alive?
20110109031938.000|20110109031940.000|TR0|
20110109031940.000|20110109031943.000|TR0|HEINZ:  Well, you know, Don, the -- the -- 
20110109031943.000|20110109031945.000|TR0|I wasn't there when initially everyone -- 
20110109031945.000|20110109031947.000|TR0|when everyone collected on the scene.  
20110109031947.000|20110109031950.000|TR0|But, you know, it -- it's a -- it's a lot 
20110109031950.000|20110109031952.000|TR0|of activity, and -- but it was very 
20110109031952.000|20110109031955.000|TR0|orderly.  A lot of respectful folks 
20110109031955.000|20110109031957.000|TR0|collecting and trying to get information 
20110109031957.000|20110109031959.000|TR0|about their loved ones.  And it was a very 
20110109031959.000|20110109032002.000|TR0|orderly process.  And -- and the staff 
20110109032002.000|20110109032004.000|TR0|here at UMC have been phenomenal.
20110109032004.000|20110109032007.000|TR0|
20110109032007.000|20110109032009.000|TR0|Social services and social workers helping 
20110109032009.000|20110109032011.000|TR0|people to -- to -- through grieving and 
20110109032011.000|20110109032014.000|TR0|through this -- through this very 
20110109032014.000|20110109032016.000|TR0|difficult time for everyone.
20110109032016.000|20110109032019.000|TR0|
20110109032019.000|20110109032021.000|TR0|LEMON:  She's a friend of yours.  She's a 
20110109032021.000|20110109032023.000|TR0|colleague.  You said she helped to -- with 
20110109032023.000|20110109032026.000|TR0|your political career?  And we should note 
20110109032026.000|20110109032028.000|TR0|that you are a doctor, you're a physician 
20110109032028.000|20110109032031.000|TR0|as well.
20110109032031.000|20110109032033.000|TR0|
20110109032033.000|20110109032035.000|TR0|HEINZ:  That's right.  I'm a -- I'm a 
20110109032035.000|20110109032038.000|TR0|internist at a different hospital here in 
20110109032038.000|20110109032040.000|TR0|Tucson.  And I -- you know, I've known 
20110109032040.000|20110109032043.000|TR0|Gabby for five years.  And I actually lost 
20110109032043.000|20110109032045.000|TR0|my first attempts to become a legislator. 
20110109032045.000|20110109032047.000|TR0|And on that very night, she came up to me, 
20110109032047.000|20110109032050.000|TR0|gave me a hug and said, "I know you're 
20110109032050.000|20110109032052.000|TR0|going to do," you know, "I know you're 
20110109032052.000|20110109032055.000|TR0|going to do this again.  And I look 
20110109032055.000|20110109032057.000|TR0|forward to working with you.  And let me 
20110109032057.000|20110109032059.000|TR0|know what I can do to help you out."
20110109032059.000|20110109032102.000|TR0|
20110109032102.000|20110109032104.000|TR0|And she's always been a dear friend, and, 
20110109032104.000|20110109032107.000|TR0|you know, my heart goes out to her family 
20110109032107.000|20110109032109.000|TR0|and all of the families of those who were 
20110109032109.000|20110109032111.000|TR0|tragically injured today and -- and who 
20110109032111.000|20110109032114.000|TR0|lost their lives.
20110109032114.000|20110109032116.000|TR0|
20110109032116.000|20110109032119.000|TR0|LEMON:  A member of her staff lost his 
20110109032119.000|20110109032121.000|TR0|life.  And I understand -- did you -- did 
20110109032121.000|20110109032123.000|TR0|you get a chance to speak to his fiancee 
20110109032123.000|20110109032126.000|TR0|or someone about him at the hospital?
20110109032126.000|20110109032128.000|TR0|
20110109032128.000|20110109032131.000|TR0|HEINZ:  You're talking about -- yes.  
20110109032131.000|20110109032133.000|TR0|You're talking about Gabe Zimmerman.  And 
20110109032133.000|20110109032135.000|TR0|I did.  And, you know, my heart goes out 
20110109032135.000|20110109032138.000|TR0|to -- to her. my heart goes out to his 
20110109032138.000|20110109032140.000|TR0|family.  A tremendous advocate for the 
20110109032140.000|20110109032143.000|TR0|people of Arizona and a tremendous 
20110109032143.000|20110109032145.000|TR0|representative of congresswoman Giffords 
20110109032145.000|20110109032147.000|TR0|we lost today, along with many others.  He 
20110109032147.000|20110109032150.000|TR0|will be missed.
20110109032150.000|20110109032152.000|TR0|
20110109032152.000|20110109032155.000|TR0|LEMON:  The sheriff of Pima county had 
20110109032155.000|20110109032157.000|TR0|some pretty -- pretty staunch things to 
20110109032157.000|20110109032159.000|TR0|say, pretty tough things to say about the 
20110109032159.000|20110109032202.000|TR0|political environment, about why someone 
20110109032202.000|20110109032204.000|TR0|might want to do something like this. 
20110109032204.000|20110109032207.000|TR0|Saying that Arizona had become a hotbed 
20110109032207.000|20110109032209.000|TR0|for bigotry and hate.  As a 
20110109032209.000|20110109032211.000|TR0|representative, do you -- do you 
20110109032211.000|20110109032214.000|TR0|understand where he's coming from? What do 
20110109032214.000|20110109032216.000|TR0|you think of his words?
20110109032216.000|20110109032219.000|TR0|
20110109032219.000|20110109032221.000|TR0|HEINZ:  You know, Don, I -- I heard those 
20110109032221.000|20110109032223.000|TR0|remarks myself.  And I think that he is, 
20110109032223.000|20110109032226.000|TR0|you know, very, very correctly calling 
20110109032226.000|20110109032228.000|TR0|attention to some of the vitriol and some 
20110109032228.000|20110109032231.000|TR0|of the -- the -- the way we're talking 
20110109032231.000|20110109032233.000|TR0|about each other in the political system.  
20110109032233.000|20110109032235.000|TR0|And how for those with troubled minds, 
20110109032235.000|20110109032238.000|TR0|sometimes some of the things that -- that 
20110109032238.000|20110109032240.000|TR0|are said are unfortunately taken in the 
20110109032240.000|20110109032243.000|TR0|wrong way.
20110109032243.000|20110109032245.000|TR0|
20110109032245.000|20110109032247.000|TR0|And these kinds of tragedies can happen.  
20110109032247.000|20110109032250.000|TR0|I think it's a very important discussion 
20110109032250.000|20110109032252.000|TR0|that we have to have as a state and as a 
20110109032252.000|20110109032255.000|TR0|country.
20110109032255.000|20110109032257.000|TR0|
20110109032257.000|20110109032259.000|TR0|LEMON:  Physician and representative Matt 
20110109032259.000|20110109032302.000|TR0|Heinz, thank you very much.

20110109032309.000|20110109032311.000|TR0|LEMON:  We're covering this story from 
20110109032311.000|20110109032314.000|TR0|here in Atlanta and Washington, D.C. as 
20110109032314.000|20110109032316.000|TR0|well, as well as Tucson, Arizona.  I want 
20110109032316.000|20110109032319.000|TR0|to go back to Washington now and my 
20110109032319.000|20110109032321.000|TR0|colleague, Wolf Blitzer.
20110109032321.000|20110109032323.000|TR0|
20110109032323.000|20110109032326.000|TR0|Wolf, it's tough to hear those words.  
20110109032326.000|20110109032328.000|TR0|Every time you hear it, it breaks your 
20110109032328.000|20110109032331.000|TR0|heart.
20110109032331.000|20110109032333.000|TR0|
20110109032333.000|20110109032335.000|TR0|BLITZER:  It breaks your heart, especially 
20110109032335.000|20110109032338.000|TR0|those of us who know her, congresswoman 
20110109032338.000|20110109032340.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.  And a lot of us do 
20110109032340.000|20110109032343.000|TR0|know her and she's an outstanding woman by 
20110109032343.000|20110109032345.000|TR0|all accounts.  This is a story that none 
20110109032345.000|20110109032347.000|TR0|of us really wants to cover but we have no 
20110109032347.000|20110109032350.000|TR0|choice.  We have to cover it.
20110109032350.000|20110109032352.000|TR0|
20110109032352.000|20110109032355.000|TR0|Eighteen people shot, as you know, Don.  
20110109032355.000|20110109032357.000|TR0|Six now confirmed dead. Police do have a 
20110109032357.000|20110109032359.000|TR0|suspect in custody.  So who is this 
20110109032359.000|20110109032402.000|TR0|individual?  How much do we really know 
20110109032402.000|20110109032404.000|TR0|about him?
20110109032404.000|20110109032407.000|TR0|
20110109032407.000|20110109032409.000|TR0|Jeanne Meserve is standing by.  She's 
20110109032409.000|20110109032411.000|TR0|getting new information. We'll join her 
20110109032411.000|20110109032414.000|TR0|after the break.  We'll also tell you 
20110109032414.000|20110109032416.000|TR0|about some of the other victims, including 
20110109032416.000|20110109032419.000|TR0|a beloved federal judge who was murdered 
20110109032419.000|20110109032421.000|TR0|today.  And could this shooting have a 
20110109032421.000|20110109032423.000|TR0|political motive behind it? Gloria Borger 
20110109032423.000|20110109032426.000|TR0|is here.  Jessica Yellin is here.  We're 
20110109032426.000|20110109032428.000|TR0|weighing all of the politics of what's 
20110109032428.000|20110109032431.000|TR0|exploding right now.  Stay with us.  Our 
20110109032431.000|20110109032433.000|TR0|special coverage will continue right after

20110109032443.000|20110109032445.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We're following the breaking 
20110109032445.000|20110109032447.000|TR0|news out of Tucson, Arizona, tonight.  A 
20110109032447.000|20110109032450.000|TR0|mass killing outside a grocery store.  And 
20110109032450.000|20110109032452.000|TR0|at the center of it, the attempted 
20110109032452.000|20110109032455.000|TR0|assassination of United States 
20110109032455.000|20110109032457.000|TR0|congresswoman.
20110109032457.000|20110109032459.000|TR0|
20110109032459.000|20110109032502.000|TR0|Six people are dead, including a federal 
20110109032502.000|20110109032504.000|TR0|judge and a 9-year-old girl.  The 
20110109032504.000|20110109032507.000|TR0|sheriff's office believes congresswoman 
20110109032507.000|20110109032509.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords was, in fact, the 
20110109032509.000|20110109032511.000|TR0|target of the attack.  She was meeting 
20110109032511.000|20110109032514.000|TR0|with constituents outside the store when 
20110109032514.000|20110109032516.000|TR0|it happened.
20110109032516.000|20110109032519.000|TR0|
20110109032519.000|20110109032521.000|TR0|Giffords was shot in the head and is now 
20110109032521.000|20110109032523.000|TR0|listed in critical condition following 
20110109032523.000|20110109032526.000|TR0|surgery.  But her doctor says he's 
20110109032526.000|20110109032528.000|TR0|optimistic about her recovery.  The 
20110109032528.000|20110109032531.000|TR0|federal judge, John Roll, was among the 
20110109032531.000|20110109032533.000|TR0|six people killed.  Authorities say he had 
20110109032533.000|20110109032535.000|TR0|stopped by the congresswoman's event 
20110109032535.000|20110109032538.000|TR0|simply to say hello.
20110109032538.000|20110109032540.000|TR0|
20110109032540.000|20110109032543.000|TR0|Police named 2S-year-old Jared -- Jared 
20110109032543.000|20110109032545.000|TR0|Lee Loughner as the suspected shooter.  
20110109032545.000|20110109032547.000|TR0|This is a picture from his Facebook page 
20110109032547.000|20110109032550.000|TR0|which has since been shut down.  The 
20110109032550.000|20110109032552.000|TR0|sheriff says he may not have acted alone. 
20110109032552.000|20110109032555.000|TR0|And tonight, a manhunt in Tucson is under 
20110109032555.000|20110109032557.000|TR0|way for another so-called person of 
20110109032557.000|20110109032559.000|TR0|interest.  Police say they've also 
20110109032559.000|20110109032602.000|TR0|recovered a Glock nine millimeter handgun.
20110109032602.000|20110109032604.000|TR0|
20110109032604.000|20110109032607.000|TR0|We're learning more about the suspect in 
20110109032607.000|20110109032609.000|TR0|custody -- this Jared Lee Loughner, but 
20110109032609.000|20110109032611.000|TR0|authorities tell CNN he isn't talking to 
20110109032611.000|20110109032614.000|TR0|investigators right now.  He's invoked his 
20110109032614.000|20110109032616.000|TR0|right to remain silent. Let's get some 
20110109032616.000|20110109032619.000|TR0|more from our homeland security 
20110109032619.000|20110109032621.000|TR0|correspondent, Jeanne Meserve.
20110109032621.000|20110109032623.000|TR0|
20110109032623.000|20110109032626.000|TR0|Jeanne, what are you finding out about 
20110109032626.000|20110109032628.000|TR0|Loughner?
20110109032628.000|20110109032631.000|TR0|
20110109032631.000|20110109032633.000|TR0|JEANNE MESERVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110109032633.000|20110109032635.000|TR0|we do know he was 22 years old.  That he 
20110109032635.000|20110109032638.000|TR0|had dropped out of Mountain View high 
20110109032638.000|20110109032640.000|TR0|school or withdrawn from Mountain View 
20110109032640.000|20110109032643.000|TR0|High School in the Marana Unified School 
20110109032643.000|20110109032645.000|TR0|District.  We also believe that he was a 
20110109032645.000|20110109032647.000|TR0|student, according to his Facebook page, 
20110109032647.000|20110109032650.000|TR0|at a local community college.
20110109032650.000|20110109032652.000|TR0|
20110109032652.000|20110109032655.000|TR0|We do know at this hour that according to 
20110109032655.000|20110109032657.000|TR0|a law enforcement source, they are seeking 
20110109032657.000|20110109032659.000|TR0|to get a couple of search warrants, one 
20110109032659.000|20110109032702.000|TR0|for a residence and one for a vehicle.  In 
20110109032702.000|20110109032704.000|TR0|addition, they are on the lookout for this 
20110109032704.000|20110109032707.000|TR0|second individual that you mentioned.
20110109032707.000|20110109032709.000|TR0|
20110109032709.000|20110109032711.000|TR0|Now, we heard the sheriff of Pima county 
20110109032711.000|20110109032714.000|TR0|saying earlier that this was a person of 
20110109032714.000|20110109032716.000|TR0|interest.  And I have spoken to other law 
20110109032716.000|20110109032719.000|TR0|enforcement officials who say they do not 
20110109032719.000|20110109032721.000|TR0|know yet how he is connected or if he is 
20110109032721.000|20110109032723.000|TR0|connected to today's events or to 
20110109032723.000|20110109032726.000|TR0|Loughner.  They do not know if he knew 
20110109032726.000|20110109032728.000|TR0|him.  They do not know if they arrived 
20110109032728.000|20110109032731.000|TR0|with him.
20110109032731.000|20110109032733.000|TR0|
20110109032733.000|20110109032735.000|TR0|I am told by a law enforcement source that 
20110109032735.000|20110109032738.000|TR0|there is a piece of evidence that connects 
20110109032738.000|20110109032740.000|TR0|this individual who the sheriff described 
20110109032740.000|20110109032743.000|TR0|as a white man in his 50s to being nearby 
20110109032743.000|20110109032745.000|TR0|the scenes of the shootings.  But at this 
20110109032745.000|20110109032747.000|TR0|point in time, we do not know exactly what 
20110109032747.000|20110109032750.000|TR0|his role may have been, if he had any role 
20110109032750.000|20110109032752.000|TR0|at all, even if he knew who this 
20110109032752.000|20110109032755.000|TR0|individual, Jared Loughner, is.
20110109032755.000|20110109032757.000|TR0|
20110109032757.000|20110109032759.000|TR0|But they are eagerly seeking him to try 
20110109032759.000|20110109032802.000|TR0|and question him and figure out if there's 
20110109032802.000|20110109032804.000|TR0|any connection there.  In addition, a 
20110109032804.000|20110109032807.000|TR0|little bit of information about the gun.  
20110109032807.000|20110109032809.000|TR0|We have been told by a separate law 
20110109032809.000|20110109032811.000|TR0|enforcement source that the Glock that was 
20110109032811.000|20110109032814.000|TR0|used in his shootings was purchased 
20110109032814.000|20110109032816.000|TR0|legally.  This law enforcement official 
20110109032816.000|20110109032819.000|TR0|didn't know when or where it was bought.  
20110109032819.000|20110109032821.000|TR0|But believed that probably the extended 
20110109032821.000|20110109032823.000|TR0|magazine that he was using that allowed 
20110109032823.000|20110109032826.000|TR0|him to hold so many rounds was probably 
20110109032826.000|20110109032828.000|TR0|purchased separately from the gun in 
20110109032828.000|20110109032831.000|TR0|question.
20110109032831.000|20110109032833.000|TR0|
20110109032833.000|20110109032835.000|TR0|We have been looking at the Youtube 
20110109032835.000|20110109032838.000|TR0|postings of Jared Loughner. Often these 
20110109032838.000|20110109032840.000|TR0|postings give us an insight into an 
20110109032840.000|20110109032843.000|TR0|individual and their state of mind.  He 
20110109032843.000|20110109032845.000|TR0|posted quite a bit on Youtube.  One of the 
20110109032845.000|20110109032847.000|TR0|things he said -- it was the -- the 
20110109032847.000|20110109032850.000|TR0|posting was entitled, "Introduction, Jared 
20110109032850.000|20110109032852.000|TR0|Loughner -- said, "My final thoughts Jared 
20110109032852.000|20110109032855.000|TR0|Lee Loughner."
20110109032855.000|20110109032857.000|TR0|
20110109032857.000|20110109032859.000|TR0|"Most people who read this text forget in 
20110109032859.000|20110109032902.000|TR0|the next two seconds, the population of 
20110109032902.000|20110109032904.000|TR0|dreamers in the United States of America 
20110109032904.000|20110109032907.000|TR0|is less than 5 percent."  There are a 
20110109032907.000|20110109032909.000|TR0|couple of references in these writings to 
20110109032909.000|20110109032911.000|TR0|conscious dreamers.  But a lot of it is 
20110109032911.000|20110109032914.000|TR0|hard for me to make sense of.  It appears 
20110109032914.000|20110109032916.000|TR0|to be an exercise in some points at 
20110109032916.000|20110109032919.000|TR0|deductive reasoning.
20110109032919.000|20110109032921.000|TR0|
20110109032921.000|20110109032923.000|TR0|He's saying if "a equals b, then b equals 
20110109032923.000|20110109032926.000|TR0|c."  A lot of it has to do with the 
20110109032926.000|20110109032928.000|TR0|currency system in the United States.  
20110109032928.000|20110109032931.000|TR0|There's one reference to terrorism.  He 
20110109032931.000|20110109032933.000|TR0|says, "Terrorists, if I define terrorist, 
20110109032933.000|20110109032935.000|TR0|then a terrorist is a person who employs 
20110109032935.000|20110109032938.000|TR0|terror or terrorism especially as a 
20110109032938.000|20110109032940.000|TR0|political weapon.  I define terrorism."
20110109032940.000|20110109032943.000|TR0|
20110109032943.000|20110109032945.000|TR0|We should say these are his writings.  No 
20110109032945.000|20110109032947.000|TR0|official we have talked to has said there 
20110109032947.000|20110109032950.000|TR0|was any nexus at all that they've 
20110109032950.000|20110109032952.000|TR0|discovered thus far between this 
20110109032952.000|20110109032955.000|TR0|individual and anybody who would be an 
20110109032955.000|20110109032957.000|TR0|international terrorist.  In addition, 
20110109032957.000|20110109032959.000|TR0|another excerpt from his Youtube page, 
20110109032959.000|20110109033002.000|TR0|refers to going to a military entrance 
20110109033002.000|20110109033004.000|TR0|processing station in Phoenix.  It says he 
20110109033004.000|20110109033007.000|TR0|got a mini Bible.  "I didn't right a 
20110109033007.000|20110109033009.000|TR0|belief on my Army application and the 
20110109033009.000|20110109033011.000|TR0|recruiter wrote on the application "none."
20110109033011.000|20110109033014.000|TR0|
20110109033014.000|20110109033016.000|TR0|We have received via our colleague Barbara 
20110109033016.000|20110109033019.000|TR0|Starr a statement from the Army that says, 
20110109033019.000|20110109033021.000|TR0|"Indeed he did attempt to enlist in the 
20110109033021.000|20110109033023.000|TR0|army but he was rejected for privacy act

20110109033033.000|20110109033035.000|TR0|BLITZER:  A lot to learn about this 
20110109033035.000|20110109033038.000|TR0|individual, the suspected shooter, Jared 
20110109033038.000|20110109033040.000|TR0|Lee Loughner.  All right, thanks, Jeanne.  
20110109033040.000|20110109033043.000|TR0|We'll get back to you -- we'll get more 
20110109033043.000|20110109033045.000|TR0|information.

20110109033047.000|20110109033050.000|TR0|Police haven't given a possible motive for 
20110109033050.000|20110109033052.000|TR0|these mass killings. But the Pima county 
20110109033052.000|20110109033055.000|TR0|Sheriff, Clarence Dupnik, did place some 
20110109033055.000|20110109033057.000|TR0|blame. He suggested in his word, and I'm 
20110109033057.000|20110109033059.000|TR0|quoting him now, "Vitriol."  That's a 
20110109033059.000|20110109033102.000|TR0|direct quote, "in politics and the media 
20110109033102.000|20110109033104.000|TR0|inflaming the American public to dangerous

20110109033109.000|20110109033111.000|TR0|Let's bring in our senior political 
20110109033111.000|20110109033114.000|TR0|analyst, Gloria Borger, and our national 
20110109033114.000|20110109033116.000|TR0|political correspondent Jessica Yellin.  
20110109033116.000|20110109033119.000|TR0|They're both working this story for us.
20110109033119.000|20110109033121.000|TR0|
20110109033121.000|20110109033123.000|TR0|You know, I've covered a lot of these news 
20110109033123.000|20110109033126.000|TR0|conferences, Jessica. Normally sheriff 
20110109033126.000|20110109033128.000|TR0|comes out, gives us the nuts and bolts.  
20110109033128.000|20110109033131.000|TR0|This was extraordinary what we heard from 
20110109033131.000|20110109033133.000|TR0|this sheriff in Pima county.
20110109033133.000|20110109033135.000|TR0|
20110109033135.000|20110109033138.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's 
20110109033138.000|20110109033140.000|TR0|right.  Because he singled out some of the 
20110109033140.000|20110109033143.000|TR0|political rhetoric as you point out in 
20110109033143.000|20110109033145.000|TR0|creating the environment that allowed this 
20110109033145.000|20110109033147.000|TR0|kind of instance to happen. Even though as 
20110109033147.000|20110109033150.000|TR0|you point out, the suspect is not 
20110109033150.000|20110109033152.000|TR0|cooperating with investigators so we don't 
20110109033152.000|20110109033155.000|TR0|know the motive.
20110109033155.000|20110109033157.000|TR0|
20110109033157.000|20110109033159.000|TR0|President Obama also delivered that 
20110109033159.000|20110109033202.000|TR0|message saying it's partly the political 
20110109033202.000|20110109033204.000|TR0|rhetoric that led to this.  So that's why 
20110109033204.000|20110109033207.000|TR0|we want to bring up one of the themes 
20110109033207.000|20110109033209.000|TR0|that's burning up on the social media 
20110109033209.000|20110109033211.000|TR0|right now.  On Twitter and Facebook there 
20110109033211.000|20110109033214.000|TR0|is a lot of talk in particular about Sarah 
20110109033214.000|20110109033216.000|TR0|Palin.
20110109033216.000|20110109033219.000|TR0|
20110109033219.000|20110109033221.000|TR0|And as you might recall, back in March of 
20110109033221.000|20110109033223.000|TR0|last year when the health care vote was 
20110109033223.000|20110109033226.000|TR0|coming to the floor of the house and when 
20110109033226.000|20110109033228.000|TR0|this was all heating up, Palin tweeted out 
20110109033228.000|20110109033231.000|TR0|a message on twitter saying, "Common sense 
20110109033231.000|20110109033233.000|TR0|conservatives don't retreat, instead 
20110109033233.000|20110109033235.000|TR0|reload.  And she referred folks to her 
20110109033235.000|20110109033238.000|TR0|Facebook page.  On that Facebook page was 
20110109033238.000|20110109033240.000|TR0|a list of Democratic members she was 
20110109033240.000|20110109033243.000|TR0|putting in cross hairs.  And Gabrielle 
20110109033243.000|20110109033245.000|TR0|Giffords was one of those in the cross 
20110109033245.000|20110109033247.000|TR0|hairs.     Now Palin has said that she did 
20110109033247.000|20110109033250.000|TR0|not mean that literally.  It was not meant 
20110109033250.000|20110109033252.000|TR0|to be a violent statement.  She didn't 
20110109033252.000|20110109033255.000|TR0|want anyone to follow through on it.  But 
20110109033255.000|20110109033257.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords was herself asked about 
20110109033257.000|20110109033259.000|TR0|this on television and she said she felt 
20110109033259.000|20110109033302.000|TR0|targeted.  This was Gabrielle Giffords -- 
20110109033302.000|20110109033304.000|TR0|March.

20110109033311.000|20110109033314.000|TR0|GIFFORDS:  We're on Sarah Palin's targeted 
20110109033314.000|20110109033316.000|TR0|list.  But the thing is, the way that she 
20110109033316.000|20110109033319.000|TR0|has it depicted as the cross hairs of a 
20110109033319.000|20110109033321.000|TR0|gun sight over our district.  When people 
20110109033321.000|20110109033323.000|TR0|do that, they've got to realize there's 
20110109033323.000|20110109033326.000|TR0|consequences to that action.

20110109033333.000|20110109033335.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Today Palin posted a statement on 
20110109033335.000|20110109033338.000|TR0|Facebook saying, "My sincere condolences 
20110109033338.000|20110109033340.000|TR0|are offered to the family of 
20110109033340.000|20110109033343.000|TR0|Representative Gabrielle Giffords and  
20110109033343.000|20110109033345.000|TR0|other victims of today's tragic shooting 
20110109033345.000|20110109033347.000|TR0|in Arizona.  On behalf of Todd and my 
20110109033347.000|20110109033350.000|TR0|family, we all pray for the victims and 
20110109033350.000|20110109033352.000|TR0|for their families and for peace and 
20110109033352.000|20110109033355.000|TR0|justice."
20110109033355.000|20110109033357.000|TR0|
20110109033357.000|20110109033359.000|TR0|And I should point out Republican leaders 
20110109033359.000|20110109033402.000|TR0|in Washington have said that this is not a 
20110109033402.000|20110109033404.000|TR0|partisan issue.  This is about violence, 
20110109033404.000|20110109033407.000|TR0|as have some tea party groups.  But 
20110109033407.000|20110109033409.000|TR0|clearly, this is a moment to talk about 
20110109033409.000|20110109033411.000|TR0|our political rhetoric.
20110109033411.000|20110109033414.000|TR0|
20110109033414.000|20110109033416.000|TR0|BLITZER:  It certainly is.  But -- but the 
20110109033416.000|20110109033419.000|TR0|question is, is there any evidence that 
20110109033419.000|20110109033421.000|TR0|the suspected shooter in this particular 
20110109033421.000|20110109033423.000|TR0|case was a Sarah Palin fan, read Sarah 
20110109033423.000|20110109033426.000|TR0|Palin's website...
20110109033426.000|20110109033428.000|TR0|
20110109033428.000|20110109033431.000|TR0|YELLIN:  No, absolutely not.
20110109033431.000|20110109033433.000|TR0|
20110109033433.000|20110109033435.000|TR0|BLITZER:  ... was a member of Facebook, 
20110109033435.000|20110109033438.000|TR0|watched her tweets or anything like that?
20110109033438.000|20110109033440.000|TR0|
20110109033440.000|20110109033443.000|TR0|YELLIN:  None at all.  And there is no 
20110109033443.000|20110109033445.000|TR0|evidence that this was even inspired by 
20110109033445.000|20110109033447.000|TR0|rage over healthcare broadly.  So there is 
20110109033447.000|20110109033450.000|TR0|no overt connection at all between Sarah 
20110109033450.000|20110109033452.000|TR0|Palin, health care and this victim in any 
20110109033452.000|20110109033455.000|TR0|way.
20110109033455.000|20110109033457.000|TR0|
20110109033457.000|20110109033459.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Talk a little bit, Gloria, about 
20110109033459.000|20110109033502.000|TR0|how this is going to impact though...
20110109033502.000|20110109033504.000|TR0|
20110109033504.000|20110109033507.000|TR0|BORGER:  Well...
20110109033507.000|20110109033509.000|TR0|
20110109033509.000|20110109033511.000|TR0|BLITZER:  ... the -- the political 
20110109033511.000|20110109033514.000|TR0|environment here in Washington and indeed 
20110109033514.000|20110109033516.000|TR0|around the country.
20110109033516.000|20110109033519.000|TR0|
20110109033519.000|20110109033521.000|TR0|BORGER:  Well, I think the sheriff kind of 
20110109033521.000|20110109033523.000|TR0|opened the can of worms.  And I think it's 
20110109033523.000|20110109033526.000|TR0|got to change the tone in Washington.  You 
20110109033526.000|20110109033528.000|TR0|know, we all talk about politics.  There's 
20110109033528.000|20110109033531.000|TR0|nothing wrong with being passionate about 
20110109033531.000|20110109033533.000|TR0|your politics.  In fact, it's great to be 
20110109033533.000|20110109033535.000|TR0|passionate about your politics.  That's -- 
20110109033535.000|20110109033538.000|TR0|that's the tradition in this country.     
20110109033538.000|20110109033540.000|TR0|But we've just been through a couple of 
20110109033540.000|20110109033543.000|TR0|really contentious years. And town hall 
20110109033543.000|20110109033545.000|TR0|meetings at which people threaten members 
20110109033545.000|20110109033547.000|TR0|of Congress. There were very heated 
20110109033547.000|20110109033550.000|TR0|arguments.  There were threats to members 
20110109033550.000|20110109033552.000|TR0|of Congress.  There was vandalism at 
20110109033552.000|20110109033555.000|TR0|members of Congress offices.  There are 
20110109033555.000|20110109033557.000|TR0|members now who say, "You know what?  
20110109033557.000|20110109033559.000|TR0|We're not protected when we go home.  And 
20110109033559.000|20110109033602.000|TR0|should that worry us?"  I mean she was 
20110109033602.000|20110109033604.000|TR0|just having a town hall meeting -- a -- a 
20110109033604.000|20110109033607.000|TR0|small group of people.
20110109033607.000|20110109033609.000|TR0|
20110109033609.000|20110109033611.000|TR0|And so I think that we have to have this 
20110109033611.000|20110109033614.000|TR0|conversation about tone, as the president 
20110109033614.000|20110109033616.000|TR0|said.  Not to take the passion out of our 
20110109033616.000|20110109033619.000|TR0|politics, but to maybe lower the decibel 
20110109033619.000|20110109033621.000|TR0|level just a touch as we discuss what we 
20110109033621.000|20110109033623.000|TR0|really care about in this country, whether 
20110109033623.000|20110109033626.000|TR0|it's the healthcare or war or anything 
20110109033626.000|20110109033628.000|TR0|else.
20110109033628.000|20110109033631.000|TR0|
20110109033631.000|20110109033633.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All these sensitive issues.
20110109033633.000|20110109033635.000|TR0|
20110109033635.000|20110109033638.000|TR0|Don Lemon is joining us as well.
20110109033638.000|20110109033640.000|TR0|
20110109033640.000|20110109033643.000|TR0|Don, I know you want to ask these ladies a 
20110109033643.000|20110109033645.000|TR0|question as well.
20110109033645.000|20110109033647.000|TR0|
20110109033647.000|20110109033650.000|TR0|LEMON:  Yes.  This is -- I've been having 
20110109033650.000|20110109033652.000|TR0|this conversation with Dana Bash earlier.  
20110109033652.000|20110109033655.000|TR0|And I want to ask either to Gloria or -- 
20110109033655.000|20110109033657.000|TR0|or Jessica.  The sheriff said vitriol.  He 
20110109033657.000|20110109033659.000|TR0|said -- he spoke "These groups are people 
20110109033659.000|20110109033702.000|TR0|who want to tear down the government."  He 
20110109033702.000|20110109033704.000|TR0|said, "The anger and hatred is outrageous. 
20110109033704.000|20110109033707.000|TR0| Arizona has become the Mecca for 
20110109033707.000|20110109033709.000|TR0|prejudice and bigotry.
20110109033709.000|20110109033711.000|TR0|
20110109033711.000|20110109033714.000|TR0|I've been watching social media all day, 
20110109033714.000|20110109033716.000|TR0|guys.  And there is this sense that the 
20110109033716.000|20110109033719.000|TR0|media and we here, journalists, are 
20110109033719.000|20110109033721.000|TR0|dancing around this when the motive is in 
20110109033721.000|20110109033723.000|TR0|that Youtube page.  And they believe that 
20110109033723.000|20110109033726.000|TR0|it is connected and that the sheriff is 
20110109033726.000|20110109033728.000|TR0|right.  And if you heard the 
20110109033728.000|20110109033731.000|TR0|representative who's on who knows Gabby, 
20110109033731.000|20110109033733.000|TR0|he says -- and he's also a doctor -- he 
20110109033733.000|20110109033735.000|TR0|believes that the sheriff is right.
20110109033735.000|20110109033738.000|TR0|
20110109033738.000|20110109033740.000|TR0|So what gives here?  Gloria, Jessica, 
20110109033740.000|20110109033743.000|TR0|either one?
20110109033743.000|20110109033745.000|TR0|
20110109033745.000|20110109033747.000|TR0|BORGER:  Well, you know, it's hard for me 
20110109033747.000|20110109033750.000|TR0|honestly to -- to answer that because I 
20110109033750.000|20110109033752.000|TR0|can't decipher the Youtube page.  There 
20110109033752.000|20110109033755.000|TR0|are parts of it that talk about being 
20110109033755.000|20110109033757.000|TR0|anti-government, as -- as you -- as you 
20110109033757.000|20110109033759.000|TR0|know.  But it's very hard to decipher 
20110109033759.000|20110109033802.000|TR0|where this person is coming from.  
20110109033802.000|20110109033804.000|TR0|Obviously the sheriff knows a lot more 
20110109033804.000|20110109033807.000|TR0|about it than we do.
20110109033807.000|20110109033809.000|TR0|
20110109033809.000|20110109033811.000|TR0|YELLIN:  It's not clear, Don, if this 
20110109033811.000|20110109033814.000|TR0|person, the suspect was far left, far 
20110109033814.000|20110109033816.000|TR0|right, just plain old mentally unstable.  
20110109033816.000|20110109033819.000|TR0|But one of the things the sheriff did say 
20110109033819.000|20110109033821.000|TR0|is that Arizona itself has become ground 
20110109033821.000|20110109033823.000|TR0|zero, in his view, for some of this 
20110109033823.000|20110109033826.000|TR0|political rhetoric.  And I've spent some 
20110109033826.000|20110109033828.000|TR0|time there, for example, covering the 
20110109033828.000|20110109033831.000|TR0|immigration wars.
20110109033831.000|20110109033833.000|TR0|
20110109033833.000|20110109033835.000|TR0|And the kind of tension you sense there, 
20110109033835.000|20110109033838.000|TR0|it is -- there is something different.  
20110109033838.000|20110109033840.000|TR0|It's not that if you feel -- there's just 
20110109033840.000|20110109033843.000|TR0|so much anger in it.  And I think that's 
20110109033843.000|20110109033845.000|TR0|what he's referring to, because it is just 
20110109033845.000|20110109033847.000|TR0|so personal and it feels overheated.       
20110109033847.000|20110109033850.000|TR0|BORGER:  And people feel their lives are 
20110109033850.000|20110109033852.000|TR0|threatened in the immigration debate, very 
20110109033852.000|20110109033855.000|TR0|seriously.  We heard that in the 
20110109033855.000|20110109033857.000|TR0|governor's race.  And so Arizona may well 
20110109033857.000|20110109033859.000|TR0|be ground zero for that.  And it's a very, 
20110109033859.000|20110109033902.000|TR0|very tough political environment that she 
20110109033902.000|20110109033904.000|TR0|went through.  Every Democratic candidate 
20110109033904.000|20110109033907.000|TR0|in that state had a tough time.  And she 
20110109033907.000|20110109033909.000|TR0|managed to win, being very well-liked, but 
20110109033909.000|20110109033911.000|TR0|still really, really tough feelings about 
20110109033911.000|20110109033914.000|TR0|that immigration issue.
20110109033914.000|20110109033916.000|TR0|
20110109033916.000|20110109033919.000|TR0|LEMON:  Wolf, you hear words like tear 
20110109033919.000|20110109033921.000|TR0|down our government. We've heard, take 
20110109033921.000|20110109033923.000|TR0|back our government, we want smaller 
20110109033923.000|20110109033926.000|TR0|government. Maybe people are putting two 
20110109033926.000|20110109033928.000|TR0|and two together and believing that that 
20110109033928.000|20110109033931.000|TR0|may be the motivation, and somehow it's 
20110109033931.000|20110109033933.000|TR0|possibly connected to the Tea Party or 
20110109033933.000|20110109033935.000|TR0|something like that.
20110109033935.000|20110109033938.000|TR0|
20110109033938.000|20110109033940.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yeah, we don't know what the 
20110109033940.000|20110109033943.000|TR0|motivation was.  We'll know a lot more, I 
20110109033943.000|20110109033945.000|TR0|guarantee you, in the next 24 hours.  And 
20110109033945.000|20110109033947.000|TR0|the police, you heard the sheriff say 
20110109033947.000|20110109033950.000|TR0|they're looking for what they describe as 
20110109033950.000|20110109033952.000|TR0|a person of interest, someone who may be 
20110109033952.000|20110109033955.000|TR0|an accomplice, who may know more.
20110109033955.000|20110109033957.000|TR0|
20110109033957.000|20110109033959.000|TR0|I just want to point out, though, that on 
20110109033959.000|20110109034002.000|TR0|his website, on his Facebook page, among 
20110109034002.000|20110109034004.000|TR0|his favorite books, Don, one book is the 
20110109034004.000|20110109034007.000|TR0|"Communist Manifesto."  And another is 
20110109034007.000|20110109034009.000|TR0|Hitler's "Mein Kampf."  So this guy has 
20110109034009.000|20110109034011.000|TR0|got from the far, far left, from the far, 
20110109034011.000|20110109034014.000|TR0|far right.  He's got a lot of favorite 
20110109034014.000|20110109034016.000|TR0|books out there.  And he's got a lot of 
20110109034016.000|20110109034019.000|TR0|weird books and a lot of rambling that is 
20110109034019.000|20110109034021.000|TR0|simply -- has no meaning to anybody who is 
20110109034021.000|20110109034023.000|TR0|trying to read it.
20110109034023.000|20110109034026.000|TR0|
20110109034026.000|20110109034028.000|TR0|So obviously this is an individual, as the 
20110109034028.000|20110109034031.000|TR0|sheriff says, who's tormented, got some 
20110109034031.000|20110109034033.000|TR0|severe mental problems.  But he does have, 
20110109034033.000|20110109034035.000|TR0|Don, according to the sheriff, a criminal 
20110109034035.000|20110109034038.000|TR0|record as well.  That raises questions, 
20110109034038.000|20110109034040.000|TR0|someone with a mental record and a 
20110109034040.000|20110109034043.000|TR0|criminal record can go into a gun store, 
20110109034043.000|20110109034045.000|TR0|buy a semiautomatic gun and go ahead and 
20110109034045.000|20110109034047.000|TR0|allegedly start killing these kinds of 
20110109034047.000|20110109034050.000|TR0|people.  I'm sure there are going to be a 
20110109034050.000|20110109034052.000|TR0|lot of questions in Arizona about that as 
20110109034052.000|20110109034055.000|TR0|well.
20110109034055.000|20110109034057.000|TR0|
20110109034057.000|20110109034059.000|TR0|LEMON:  If someone is unstable, really, it 
20110109034059.000|20110109034102.000|TR0|makes no sense.  Maybe trying to make 
20110109034102.000|20110109034104.000|TR0|sense of it is nonsensical, because he 
20110109034104.000|20110109034107.000|TR0|just -- as the sheriff says, he believes 
20110109034107.000|20110109034109.000|TR0|this young man has some mental issues.
20110109034109.000|20110109034111.000|TR0|

20110109034316.000|20110109034319.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL 
20110109034319.000|20110109034321.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  They might say something 
20110109034321.000|20110109034323.000|TR0|like raise two fingers or something like 
20110109034323.000|20110109034326.000|TR0|that to really get an idea, is she able to 
20110109034326.000|20110109034328.000|TR0|hear?  Is she able to process that 
20110109034328.000|20110109034331.000|TR0|information and then able to execute a 
20110109034331.000|20110109034333.000|TR0|command based on that.
20110109034333.000|20110109034335.000|TR0|
20110109034335.000|20110109034338.000|TR0|Obviously, if she can do all those things 
20110109034338.000|20110109034340.000|TR0|-- it tells you a lot, if someone can 
20110109034340.000|20110109034343.000|TR0|follow commands.  It's one of the first 
20110109034343.000|20110109034345.000|TR0|things you check when someone comes out of 
20110109034345.000|20110109034347.000|TR0|the operating room.  So they go there -- 
20110109034347.000|20110109034350.000|TR0|she goes to the hospital, probably got a 
20110109034350.000|20110109034352.000|TR0|CT scan.  Goes to the operating room, has 
20110109034352.000|20110109034355.000|TR0|the surgery.  And now everyone's sort of 
20110109034355.000|20110109034357.000|TR0|trying to figure out how well is she going 
20110109034357.000|20110109034359.000|TR0|to do?  Well, that obeying commands thing 
20110109034359.000|20110109034402.000|TR0|is a very important and good sign in the 
20110109034402.000|20110109034404.000|TR0|initial aftermath.

20110109034411.000|20110109034414.000|TR0|LEMON:  If anyone should know, it's Dr. 
20110109034414.000|20110109034416.000|TR0|Sanjay Gupta.  He is a neurosurgeon.  Wolf 
20110109034416.000|20110109034419.000|TR0|Blitzer, I heard you having a conversation 
20110109034419.000|20110109034421.000|TR0|with Sanjay earlier.  And doctors, 
20110109034421.000|20110109034423.000|TR0|especially surgeons, they don't like to 
20110109034423.000|20110109034426.000|TR0|give it away.  They sort of hedge a little 
20110109034426.000|20110109034428.000|TR0|bit, not to give people false hope.
20110109034428.000|20110109034431.000|TR0|
20110109034431.000|20110109034433.000|TR0|BLITZER:  This surgeon, Dr. Rhee, was very 
20110109034433.000|20110109034435.000|TR0|upbeat, relatively speaking.  He said 
20110109034435.000|20110109034438.000|TR0|under the circumstances, he's about as 
20110109034438.000|20110109034440.000|TR0|optimistic as you can get about her 
20110109034440.000|20110109034443.000|TR0|eventual recovery.  It's almost a miracle, 
20110109034443.000|20110109034445.000|TR0|I must say.  If a bullet goes through part 
20110109034445.000|20110109034447.000|TR0|of the brain, and goes in the head and out 
20110109034447.000|20110109034450.000|TR0|of the head, and they managed to keep her 
20110109034450.000|20110109034452.000|TR0|alive 00 she's alive and apparently she's 
20110109034452.000|20110109034455.000|TR0|responding.  As Sanjay pointed out, that 
20110109034455.000|20110109034457.000|TR0|is very, very encouraging.
20110109034457.000|20110109034459.000|TR0|
20110109034459.000|20110109034502.000|TR0|We're all, of course, praying for her.  
20110109034502.000|20110109034504.000|TR0|We're praying for all of the others who 
20110109034504.000|20110109034507.000|TR0|were seriously injured.  Many of them are 
20110109034507.000|20110109034509.000|TR0|in critical condition right now.  This 
20110109034509.000|20110109034511.000|TR0|alleged shooter simply opening up fire at 
20110109034511.000|20110109034514.000|TR0|point-blank range and going boom, boom, 
20110109034514.000|20110109034516.000|TR0|boom, boom.
20110109034516.000|20110109034519.000|TR0|
20110109034519.000|20110109034521.000|TR0|You heard one of the eye witnesses say it 
20110109034521.000|20110109034523.000|TR0|sounded like firecrackers.  One sound, one 
20110109034523.000|20110109034526.000|TR0|crack right after another.  What a 
20110109034526.000|20110109034528.000|TR0|shocking story.  Let's hope for the best.
20110109034528.000|20110109034531.000|TR0|
20110109034531.000|20110109034533.000|TR0|But Sanjay is a neurosurgeon.  He knows 
20110109034533.000|20110109034535.000|TR0|what he's talking about. So far so good.  
20110109034535.000|20110109034538.000|TR0|Let's hope she survives.  Not so good for 
20110109034538.000|20110109034540.000|TR0|some of the others, including the Federal 
20110109034540.000|20110109034543.000|TR0|Judge John Roll who passed away, this 
20110109034543.000|20110109034545.000|TR0|nine-year-old who died, and we were also 
20110109034545.000|20110109034547.000|TR0|told one of the other victims a senior 
20110109034547.000|20110109034550.000|TR0|aide to the congresswoman, Gabe Zimmerman, 
20110109034550.000|20110109034552.000|TR0|was shot and killed as well.
20110109034552.000|20110109034555.000|TR0|
20110109034555.000|20110109034557.000|TR0|Don, stand by.  We're going to have much 
20110109034557.000|20110109034559.000|TR0|more on this beloved federal judge who was 
20110109034559.000|20110109034602.000|TR0|among the victims killed in Tucson.  Who 
20110109034602.000|20110109034604.000|TR0|was he? Who were some of the other victims 
20110109034604.000|20110109034607.000|TR0|as well?  More information is coming in on 
20110109034607.000|20110109034609.000|TR0|that.  Our breaking news coverage here at

20110109034621.000|20110109034623.000|TR0|the latest coming out of Tucson, Arizona.  
20110109034623.000|20110109034626.000|TR0|That's where a U.S. congresswoman is now 
20110109034626.000|20110109034628.000|TR0|hospitalized after being critically 
20110109034628.000|20110109034631.000|TR0|wounded in the head at a gathering of 
20110109034631.000|20110109034633.000|TR0|constituents outside a supermarket.  She's 
20110109034633.000|20110109034635.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat, just 
20110109034635.000|20110109034638.000|TR0|beginning her third term here in 
20110109034638.000|20110109034640.000|TR0|Washington on Capitol Hill.
20110109034640.000|20110109034643.000|TR0|
20110109034643.000|20110109034645.000|TR0|Before that, she served in the Arizona 
20110109034645.000|20110109034647.000|TR0|House and Senate.  She's married to an 
20110109034647.000|20110109034650.000|TR0|astronaut, Mark Kelly.  Seventeen other 
20110109034650.000|20110109034652.000|TR0|people were shot in the same attack, six 
20110109034652.000|20110109034655.000|TR0|are dead.  We'll have more about them in a 
20110109034655.000|20110109034657.000|TR0|moment.
20110109034657.000|20110109034659.000|TR0|
20110109034659.000|20110109034702.000|TR0|But investigators say they believe 
20110109034702.000|20110109034704.000|TR0|Giffords was the primary target, which 
20110109034704.000|20110109034707.000|TR0|makes this an attempted assassination.  A 
20110109034707.000|20110109034709.000|TR0|suspect is being held, 22-year-old Jared 
20110109034709.000|20110109034711.000|TR0|Lee Loughner.  And a nine millimeter Glock 
20110109034711.000|20110109034714.000|TR0|semiautomatic handgun has been recovered.

20110109034716.000|20110109034719.000|TR0|Police are looking for one other person 
20110109034719.000|20110109034721.000|TR0|who's described as a person of interest.  
20110109034721.000|20110109034723.000|TR0|The shooting happened about 10:10 a.m. 
20110109034723.000|20110109034726.000|TR0|this morning, Tucson time, just after noon 
20110109034726.000|20110109034728.000|TR0|eastern, 12:10 eastern, during an outdoor 
20110109034728.000|20110109034731.000|TR0|town meeting event at a Tucson shopping

20110109034752.000|20110109034755.000|TR0|SHOOTING SCENE:  There is a sense of sort 
20110109034755.000|20110109034757.000|TR0|of unreality.  And to be honest, I froze 
20110109034757.000|20110109034759.000|TR0|for probably a second, just not quite 
20110109034759.000|20110109034802.000|TR0|understanding what was going on.  He 
20110109034802.000|20110109034804.000|TR0|continued to fire sort of rapidly, really 
20110109034804.000|20110109034807.000|TR0|at point-blank range.  And the way things 
20110109034807.000|20110109034809.000|TR0|are set up, people really had no route to 
20110109034809.000|20110109034811.000|TR0|escape.

20110109034821.000|20110109034823.000|TR0|when he saw what was going on, he himself 
20110109034823.000|20110109034826.000|TR0|hid behind a column.  Then he dropped -- 
20110109034826.000|20110109034828.000|TR0|once a couple of other people grabbed the 
20110109034828.000|20110109034831.000|TR0|alleged shooter, brought him down, he 
20110109034831.000|20110109034833.000|TR0|joined in, held that shooter down as well, 
20110109034833.000|20110109034835.000|TR0|before he then started to help some of 
20110109034835.000|20110109034838.000|TR0|those who were severely injured.  Dr.

20110109034847.000|20110109034850.000|TR0|with this shooter who simply opened fire 
20110109034850.000|20110109034852.000|TR0|and started killing people.

20110109034857.000|20110109034859.000|TR0|that interview that you did with that 
20110109034859.000|20110109034902.000|TR0|young man and he said the scene wasn't as 
20110109034902.000|20110109034904.000|TR0|chaotic as you would think it would be.  
20110109034904.000|20110109034907.000|TR0|People were fairly calm, and even a woman 
20110109034907.000|20110109034909.000|TR0|jumped in to help and to pull the magazine 
20110109034909.000|20110109034911.000|TR0|out of the gun.  So unbelievable.  
20110109034911.000|20110109034914.000|TR0|Unbelievable.

20110109034926.000|20110109034928.000|TR0|You know, Wolf, among those six fatalities 
20110109034928.000|20110109034931.000|TR0|today, a federal judge.  John Roll 
20110109034931.000|20110109034933.000|TR0|presided over the U.S. District Court for 
20110109034933.000|20110109034935.000|TR0|the District of Arizona.  This was someone 
20110109034935.000|20110109034938.000|TR0|who really worked his way up from the 
20110109034938.000|20110109034940.000|TR0|bottom of the legal ladder.  He started 
20110109034940.000|20110109034943.000|TR0|his career as a bailiff in a county court.

20110109034947.000|20110109034950.000|TR0|a routine event was Congresswoman 
20110109034950.000|20110109034952.000|TR0|Giffords' director of community outreach, 
20110109034952.000|20110109034955.000|TR0|Gabe Zimmerman.  He specialized in the

20110109034957.000|20110109034959.000|TR0|others were gunned down.  He was 30 years

20110109035031.000|20110109035033.000|TR0|council and was invited to Giffords' event

20110109035055.000|20110109035057.000|TR0|coverage.  Here's where things stand right 
20110109035057.000|20110109035059.000|TR0|now: six people are dead and 12 wounded 
20110109035059.000|20110109035102.000|TR0|after a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona.  
20110109035102.000|20110109035104.000|TR0|Among the five people in critical 
20110109035104.000|20110109035107.000|TR0|condition tonight, Arizona Congresswoman 
20110109035107.000|20110109035109.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.
20110109035109.000|20110109035111.000|TR0|
20110109035111.000|20110109035114.000|TR0|Doctors say a single bullet passed through 
20110109035114.000|20110109035116.000|TR0|her brain.  However, they are cautiously 
20110109035116.000|20110109035119.000|TR0|optimistic because Giffords was able to 
20110109035119.000|20110109035121.000|TR0|follow commands when she came out of 
20110109035121.000|20110109035123.000|TR0|anesthesia after that surgery. Giffords's 
20110109035123.000|20110109035126.000|TR0|husband, NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, is at 
20110109035126.000|20110109035128.000|TR0|her side.       The shooting happened this 
20110109035128.000|20110109035131.000|TR0|morning while Giffords was meeting with 
20110109035131.000|20110109035133.000|TR0|constituents at a Tucson shopping center.  
20110109035133.000|20110109035135.000|TR0|The alleged gunman is in custody.  
20110109035135.000|20110109035138.000|TR0|Onlookers attacked him at the scene.  He 
20110109035138.000|20110109035140.000|TR0|is identified as 22-year-old Jared Lee 
20110109035140.000|20110109035143.000|TR0|Loughner.

20110109035238.000|20110109035240.000|TR0|outside immediately.  I didn't actually 
20110109035240.000|20110109035243.000|TR0|see a vehicle or any people fleeing.  I 
20110109035243.000|20110109035245.000|TR0|just saw people running, screaming towards

20110109035257.000|20110109035259.000|TR0|those three choppers and they loaded 
20110109035259.000|20110109035302.000|TR0|people into them as soon as they could and 
20110109035302.000|20110109035304.000|TR0|got those 12 injured victims off and to 
20110109035304.000|20110109035307.000|TR0|the hospital.  We are told that Gabrielle

20110109035455.000|20110109035457.000|TR0|natural and it's human.  I'm not a 
20110109035457.000|20110109035459.000|TR0|psychologist.  I'm a journalist who just 
20110109035459.000|20110109035502.000|TR0|spent two years of his life exploring the 
20110109035502.000|20110109035504.000|TR0|experiences of mass murder survivors and 
20110109035504.000|20110109035507.000|TR0|their would-be killers.  And let me assure 
20110109035507.000|20110109035509.000|TR0|you, nobody wants to know the answers to 
20110109035509.000|20110109035511.000|TR0|that question more tonight than the

20110109035523.000|20110109035526.000|TR0|to have to be patient.  Nothing I've seen 
20110109035526.000|20110109035528.000|TR0|yet suggests that Jared Lee Loughner isn't 
20110109035528.000|20110109035531.000|TR0|well within the profile of the typical 
20110109035531.000|20110109035533.000|TR0|mass murderer in our American experience, 
20110109035533.000|20110109035535.000|TR0|sadly to say.
20110109035535.000|20110109035538.000|TR0|
20110109035538.000|20110109035540.000|TR0|He's -- so far, the bits of evidence -- 
20110109035540.000|20110109035543.000|TR0|all intriguing that we're seeing suggest 
20110109035543.000|20110109035545.000|TR0|he's a garden variety mass murderer.
20110109035545.000|20110109035547.000|TR0|
20110109035547.000|20110109035550.000|TR0|LEMON:  We listened to a press conference 
20110109035550.000|20110109035552.000|TR0|with the sheriff in Pima County.  And he 
20110109035552.000|20110109035555.000|TR0|says obviously this young man has mental 
20110109035555.000|20110109035557.000|TR0|issues. And people with mental issues are 
20110109035557.000|20110109035559.000|TR0|more susceptible to vitriol.  Does that 
20110109035559.000|20110109035602.000|TR0|fit the profile?
20110109035602.000|20110109035604.000|TR0|
20110109035604.000|20110109035607.000|TR0|FRANSCELL:  Sure.  I don't know about the 
20110109035607.000|20110109035609.000|TR0|last part about they're susceptible to the 
20110109035609.000|20110109035611.000|TR0|vitriol.  I think somebody's trying to 
20110109035611.000|20110109035614.000|TR0|imprint the political cauldron in Arizona 
20110109035614.000|20110109035616.000|TR0|on this.  We don't yet know -- we really 
20110109035616.000|20110109035619.000|TR0|don't know if that's the case.
20110109035619.000|20110109035621.000|TR0|
20110109035621.000|20110109035623.000|TR0|I think it's possible.  I think the highly 
20110109035623.000|20110109035626.000|TR0|charged political atmosphere could be the 
20110109035626.000|20110109035628.000|TR0|crucible in which it was galvanized.  But 
20110109035628.000|20110109035631.000|TR0|it's -- just strikes me as unlikely the 
20110109035631.000|20110109035633.000|TR0|cause of the attack.
20110109035633.000|20110109035635.000|TR0|
20110109035635.000|20110109035638.000|TR0|LEMON:  And it's import to point out too.  
20110109035638.000|20110109035640.000|TR0|We mentioned that and we talked about it.  
20110109035640.000|20110109035643.000|TR0|I talked about it with Wolf and our 
20110109035643.000|20110109035645.000|TR0|political players there in Washington 
20110109035645.000|20110109035647.000|TR0|because the sheriff mentioned it at that 
20110109035647.000|20110109035650.000|TR0|press conference.  He brought to it light 
20110109035650.000|20110109035652.000|TR0|and mentioned it twice.  He was very 
20110109035652.000|20110109035655.000|TR0|vehement about it.
20110109035655.000|20110109035657.000|TR0|
20110109035657.000|20110109035659.000|TR0|So, listen, I want to ask you: many times 
20110109035659.000|20110109035702.000|TR0|when things like this happen, the gunman 
20110109035702.000|20110109035704.000|TR0|will turn the gun on himself.  So does it 
20110109035704.000|20110109035707.000|TR0|mean anything that Loughner didn't kill 
20110109035707.000|20110109035709.000|TR0|himself?
20110109035709.000|20110109035711.000|TR0|
20110109035711.000|20110109035714.000|TR0|FRANSCELL:  Yes.  It means something.  We 
20110109035714.000|20110109035716.000|TR0|don't know what yet. But it does mean 
20110109035716.000|20110109035719.000|TR0|something.  The typical American mass 
20110109035719.000|20110109035721.000|TR0|murder has given no thought to an escape.  
20110109035721.000|20110109035723.000|TR0|He probably doesn't even care about an 
20110109035723.000|20110109035726.000|TR0|escape and often anticipates being killed 
20110109035726.000|20110109035728.000|TR0|or killing himself.
20110109035728.000|20110109035731.000|TR0|
20110109035731.000|20110109035733.000|TR0|We have darn few examples of mass 
20110109035733.000|20110109035735.000|TR0|murderers surviving the crime and being 
20110109035735.000|20110109035738.000|TR0|around for us to ask questions.  So that's 
20110109035738.000|20110109035740.000|TR0|valuable.
20110109035740.000|20110109035743.000|TR0|
20110109035743.000|20110109035745.000|TR0|LEMON:  Ron, I want you to listen to 
20110109035745.000|20110109035747.000|TR0|someone who was there, who witnessed this. 
20110109035747.000|20110109035750.000|TR0| His name is Dr. Steven Rayle.  And then 
20110109035750.000|20110109035752.000|TR0|we'll talk about it.
20110109035752.000|20110109035755.000|TR0|
20110109035755.000|20110109035757.000|TR0|FRANSCELL:  OK.
20110109035757.000|20110109035759.000|TR0|
20110109035759.000|20110109035802.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110109035802.000|20110109035804.000|TR0|
20110109035804.000|20110109035807.000|TR0|RAYLE:  There is a sense of sort of 
20110109035807.000|20110109035809.000|TR0|unreality.  And to be honest, I froze for 
20110109035809.000|20110109035811.000|TR0|probably a second, just not quite 
20110109035811.000|20110109035814.000|TR0|understanding what was going on.  He 
20110109035814.000|20110109035816.000|TR0|continued to fire sort of rapidly, really 
20110109035816.000|20110109035819.000|TR0|at point-blank range.  And the way things 
20110109035819.000|20110109035821.000|TR0|are set up, people really had no route to 
20110109035821.000|20110109035823.000|TR0|escape.
20110109035823.000|20110109035826.000|TR0|
20110109035826.000|20110109035828.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110109035828.000|20110109035831.000|TR0|
20110109035831.000|20110109035833.000|TR0|LEMON:  He is talking about witnessing it. 
20110109035833.000|20110109035835.000|TR0| He's talking about helping out.  Is this 
20110109035835.000|20110109035838.000|TR0|typical of people who survive these kinds 
20110109035838.000|20110109035840.000|TR0|of things to jump in and help out?  And as 
20110109035840.000|20110109035843.000|TR0|he said during that same interview, it was 
20110109035843.000|20110109035845.000|TR0|not as chaotic as you might think?
20110109035845.000|20110109035847.000|TR0|
20110109035847.000|20110109035850.000|TR0|FRANSCELL:  Absolutely.  We could take 
20110109035850.000|20110109035852.000|TR0|that comment and drop it into any account 
20110109035852.000|20110109035855.000|TR0|from almost all of the modern mass murders 
20110109035855.000|20110109035857.000|TR0|that we've -- we've endured here.  The 
20110109035857.000|20110109035859.000|TR0|Lukey's Cafeteria Massacre in Colleen, 
20110109035859.000|20110109035902.000|TR0|Texas, in 1991 -- many of the witnesses' 
20110109035902.000|20110109035904.000|TR0|statements were like that.  A truck 
20110109035904.000|20110109035907.000|TR0|crashes through a window and the immediate 
20110109035907.000|20110109035909.000|TR0|-- the immediate thought through most 
20110109035909.000|20110109035911.000|TR0|minds was that someone had had a heart 
20110109035911.000|20110109035914.000|TR0|attack and veered off -- out of the 
20110109035914.000|20110109035916.000|TR0|parking lot into the restaurant.
20110109035916.000|20110109035919.000|TR0|
20110109035919.000|20110109035921.000|TR0|And people were getting up to rush to the 
20110109035921.000|20110109035923.000|TR0|aid of the driver.  One of those people 
20110109035923.000|20110109035926.000|TR0|was the first to die.

20110109035928.000|20110109035931.000|TR0|LEMON:  Ron Franscell, thank you very 
20110109035931.000|20110109035933.000|TR0|much.  We appreciate you joining us this 
20110109035933.000|20110109035935.000|TR0|evening on CNN.
