20110109020026.000|20110109020029.000|TR0|specifically Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110109020029.000|20110109020032.000|TR0|Giffords.  Stand by with us for a moment, 
20110109020032.000|20110109020034.000|TR0|if you can.

20110109020037.000|20110109020040.000|TR0|I just want to tell our viewers, we're 
20110109020040.000|20110109020043.000|TR0|continuing our CNN Special Coverage, a 
20110109020043.000|20110109020045.000|TR0|congresswoman has been shot.  There's been 
20110109020045.000|20110109020048.000|TR0|a killing spree in Arizona.  Six people 
20110109020048.000|20110109020051.000|TR0|are dead and at least 13 others are 
20110109020051.000|20110109020054.000|TR0|wounded. I want to bring you up to date on 
20110109020054.000|20110109020057.000|TR0|a the very newest details from a news 
20110109020057.000|20110109020059.000|TR0|conference in Tucson, just a few moments 
20110109020059.000|20110109020102.000|TR0|ago.
20110109020102.000|20110109020105.000|TR0|
20110109020105.000|20110109020108.000|TR0|The Pima County sheriff says investigators 
20110109020108.000|20110109020110.000|TR0|believe that Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110109020110.000|20110109020113.000|TR0|Giffords was in fact the target of the 
20110109020113.000|20110109020116.000|TR0|mass shooting outside a Tucson 
20110109020116.000|20110109020119.000|TR0|supermarket.  In other words and 
20110109020119.000|20110109020122.000|TR0|assassination attempt was made on a member 
20110109020122.000|20110109020124.000|TR0|of the United States Congress today.  
20110109020124.000|20110109020127.000|TR0|Giffords was shot through the brain but 
20110109020127.000|20110109020130.000|TR0|came through surgery and doctors now say 
20110109020130.000|20110109020133.000|TR0|they're, quote, "very optimistic" about 
20110109020133.000|20110109020135.000|TR0|her recovery.
20110109020135.000|20110109020138.000|TR0|
20110109020138.000|20110109020141.000|TR0|The sheriff also says he's not convinced 
20110109020141.000|20110109020144.000|TR0|the suspect in custody acted alone.  
20110109020144.000|20110109020147.000|TR0|Authorities are looking for what they 
20110109020147.000|20110109020149.000|TR0|described as a person of interest, who may 
20110109020149.000|20110109020152.000|TR0|have accompanied Jared Lee Loughner to the 
20110109020152.000|20110109020155.000|TR0|gathering.  Here is the sheriff only 
20110109020155.000|20110109020158.000|TR0|moments ago.

20110109020209.000|20110109020212.000|TR0|ARIZONA:  Well, he has kind of a trouble 
20110109020212.000|20110109020214.000|TR0|past, I can tell you that.  And we're not 
20110109020214.000|20110109020217.000|TR0|convinced that he acted alone.  There's 
20110109020217.000|20110109020220.000|TR0|some reason to believe that he came to 
20110109020220.000|20110109020223.000|TR0|this location with another individual.  
20110109020223.000|20110109020225.000|TR0|And there's reason to believe that the 
20110109020225.000|20110109020228.000|TR0|other individual in some way may be 
20110109020228.000|20110109020231.000|TR0|involved.

20110109020239.000|20110109020242.000|TR0|BLITZER:  You heard that from the sheriff 
20110109020242.000|20110109020245.000|TR0|right there.  Let's go to the scene.  Ted 
20110109020245.000|20110109020248.000|TR0|Rowlands is over at the University Medical 
20110109020248.000|20110109020250.000|TR0|Center, in Tucson.  That is where 
20110109020250.000|20110109020253.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords underwent hours of 
20110109020253.000|20110109020256.000|TR0|surgery today.
20110109020256.000|20110109020259.000|TR0|
20110109020259.000|20110109020302.000|TR0|What's the latest?
20110109020302.000|20110109020304.000|TR0|
20110109020304.000|20110109020307.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110109020307.000|20110109020310.000|TR0|Wolf, the very latest is they are 
20110109020310.000|20110109020313.000|TR0|cautiously optimistic, the doctors that 
20110109020313.000|20110109020315.000|TR0|performed that surgery. She came out of 
20110109020315.000|20110109020318.000|TR0|surgery at about 1:15 this afternoon and 
20110109020318.000|20110109020321.000|TR0|following the procedure, as she was coming 
20110109020321.000|20110109020324.000|TR0|out of the anesthesia, she was able to 
20110109020324.000|20110109020327.000|TR0|follow commands.  So they were telling her 
20110109020327.000|20110109020329.000|TR0|to do certain things, she wasn't 
20110109020329.000|20110109020332.000|TR0|necessarily speaking, but she was 
20110109020332.000|20110109020335.000|TR0|receiving those commands and following 
20110109020335.000|20110109020338.000|TR0|them.  So they're very encouraged by that, 
20110109020338.000|20110109020340.000|TR0|but the next 24 hours are critical because 
20110109020340.000|20110109020343.000|TR0|of the possibility of brain swelling, etc 
20110109020343.000|20110109020346.000|TR0|cetera.  They are watching her very 
20110109020346.000|20110109020349.000|TR0|closely.  She's still in critical 
20110109020349.000|20110109020352.000|TR0|condition, one of 10 patients brought 
20110109020352.000|20110109020354.000|TR0|here.  Five in critical, five in serious 
20110109020354.000|20110109020357.000|TR0|condition.
20110109020357.000|20110109020400.000|TR0|
20110109020400.000|20110109020403.000|TR0|This is also the facility where that 
20110109020403.000|20110109020405.000|TR0|nine-year-old girl was brought. She later 
20110109020405.000|20110109020408.000|TR0|died, here at the facility, after a short 
20110109020408.000|20110109020411.000|TR0|period of time. As you can see out the 
20110109020411.000|20110109020414.000|TR0|hospital, here, there are hundreds of 
20110109020414.000|20110109020417.000|TR0|people. A lot of them with candles here 
20110109020417.000|20110109020419.000|TR0|that are just standing vigil, and there's 
20110109020419.000|20110109020422.000|TR0|a photograph of the congresswoman.  And a 
20110109020422.000|20110109020425.000|TR0|lot of these people know her, a lot of 
20110109020425.000|20110109020428.000|TR0|people work with her, and a lot of them 
20110109020428.000|20110109020430.000|TR0|were constituents or people in the 
20110109020430.000|20110109020433.000|TR0|community.
20110109020433.000|20110109020436.000|TR0|
20110109020436.000|20110109020439.000|TR0|One of the people who knows the family 
20110109020439.000|20110109020442.000|TR0|quite well is John Wesley Miller.
20110109020442.000|20110109020444.000|TR0|
20110109020444.000|20110109020447.000|TR0|John, you have been inside the hospital 
20110109020447.000|20110109020450.000|TR0|all day with friends and family members.  
20110109020450.000|20110109020453.000|TR0|We have been briefed that she's doing 
20110109020453.000|20110109020455.000|TR0|well, that she came out of surgery well.  
20110109020455.000|20110109020458.000|TR0|What have you heard from the doctors 
20110109020458.000|20110109020501.000|TR0|during the briefings that were giving you?
20110109020501.000|20110109020504.000|TR0|
20110109020504.000|20110109020507.000|TR0|JOHN WESLEY MILLER, REP. GIFFORDS FAMILY 
20110109020507.000|20110109020509.000|TR0|FRIEND:  They were very happy with the 
20110109020509.000|20110109020512.000|TR0|surgery they were able to do.  She was 
20110109020512.000|20110109020515.000|TR0|responding to commands, I don't know 
20110109020515.000|20110109020518.000|TR0|exactly what they were.  But we're 
20110109020518.000|20110109020521.000|TR0|optimistic, we're hopeful.  And we're 
20110109020521.000|20110109020523.000|TR0|asking for everyone that's watching this 
20110109020523.000|20110109020526.000|TR0|to please pray for Gabby.  She's a 
20110109020526.000|20110109020529.000|TR0|wonderful, wonderful young lady.  I love 
20110109020529.000|20110109020532.000|TR0|her like a daughter.
20110109020532.000|20110109020534.000|TR0|
20110109020534.000|20110109020537.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Set the scene inside the 
20110109020537.000|20110109020540.000|TR0|hospital.  You say you were in a room with 
20110109020540.000|20110109020543.000|TR0|other family members, and you say you have 
20110109020543.000|20110109020546.000|TR0|been crying all day.  Pretty emotional in 
20110109020546.000|20110109020548.000|TR0|there?
20110109020548.000|20110109020551.000|TR0|
20110109020551.000|20110109020554.000|TR0|MILLER:  Very, very.  I mean it's such a 
20110109020554.000|20110109020557.000|TR0|shock to think that someone could want to 
20110109020557.000|20110109020559.000|TR0|harm such a beautiful person, inside and 
20110109020559.000|20110109020602.000|TR0|out.  Gabby is just a treasure of Tucson 
20110109020602.000|20110109020605.000|TR0|and our community.  She's done so much to 
20110109020605.000|20110109020608.000|TR0|help us, to help our economy, to help us 
20110109020608.000|20110109020611.000|TR0|to learn how to utilize solar energy, 
20110109020611.000|20110109020613.000|TR0|she's pro-business.  I'm a Republican for 
20110109020613.000|20110109020616.000|TR0|Gabby Giffords, so I just love her.
20110109020616.000|20110109020619.000|TR0|
20110109020619.000|20110109020622.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Her husband, her parents, who 
20110109020622.000|20110109020624.000|TR0|you know quite well are at her side.  What 
20110109020624.000|20110109020627.000|TR0|are you thinking?  And what goes through 
20110109020627.000|20110109020630.000|TR0|you and the family at this time over the 
20110109020630.000|20110109020633.000|TR0|next 24 hours?  Is everybody pretty 
20110109020633.000|20110109020636.000|TR0|optimistic because of the good news that's 
20110109020636.000|20110109020638.000|TR0|been reported?
20110109020638.000|20110109020641.000|TR0|
20110109020641.000|20110109020644.000|TR0|MILLER:  Yes.  Everyone that I know here 
20110109020644.000|20110109020647.000|TR0|and I have probably seen 1,000 people here 
20110109020647.000|20110109020649.000|TR0|today, extremely optimistic; we're all 
20110109020649.000|20110109020652.000|TR0|praying for her, she won't give up.  We 
20110109020652.000|20110109020655.000|TR0|know that.  She's a fighter.  She's a 
20110109020655.000|20110109020658.000|TR0|wonderful, wonderful person.
20110109020658.000|20110109020701.000|TR0|
20110109020701.000|20110109020703.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Thank you, sir.  And I'm sure a 
20110109020703.000|20110109020706.000|TR0|lot of people will be praying for her.  
20110109020706.000|20110109020709.000|TR0|Appreciate it.
20110109020709.000|20110109020712.000|TR0|
20110109020712.000|20110109020714.000|TR0|Again, Wolf, it is fairly optimistic, the 
20110109020714.000|20110109020717.000|TR0|mood out here because of the update that 
20110109020717.000|20110109020720.000|TR0|the hospital gave a few hours ago.  But 
20110109020720.000|20110109020723.000|TR0|clearly she has a long way to go here in 
20110109020723.000|20110109020726.000|TR0|her recovery.  Doctors have said they are 
20110109020726.000|20110109020728.000|TR0|not quite sure-you know, they don't want 
20110109020728.000|20110109020731.000|TR0|to speculate on what kind of recovery 
20110109020731.000|20110109020734.000|TR0|they're talking about, but the mood here 
20110109020734.000|20110109020737.000|TR0|somber, but I would say somewhat 
20110109020737.000|20110109020739.000|TR0|optimistic.
20110109020739.000|20110109020742.000|TR0|
20110109020742.000|20110109020745.000|TR0|BLITZER:  As far as she's concerned, Ted, 
20110109020745.000|20110109020748.000|TR0|but there's still, as we have been 
20110109020748.000|20110109020751.000|TR0|reporting, 13 others who were wounded, 
20110109020751.000|20110109020753.000|TR0|some of them in very, very critical 
20110109020753.000|20110109020756.000|TR0|condition.  Six confirmed dead, are we 
20110109020756.000|20110109020759.000|TR0|expecting any formal briefing from 
20110109020759.000|20110109020802.000|TR0|hospital authorities, from the surgeons, 
20110109020802.000|20110109020804.000|TR0|the doctors any time soon?  Have they told 
20110109020804.000|20110109020807.000|TR0|you, Ted?
20110109020807.000|20110109020810.000|TR0|
20110109020810.000|20110109020813.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  They haven't scheduled any 
20110109020813.000|20110109020816.000|TR0|updates, if you will, like they had before 
20110109020816.000|20110109020818.000|TR0|with a full press conference.  However we 
20110109020818.000|20110109020821.000|TR0|are in contact with the liaison with the 
20110109020821.000|20110109020824.000|TR0|hospital and are getting updates from that 
20110109020824.000|20110109020827.000|TR0|individual as there's any change.  At this 
20110109020827.000|20110109020829.000|TR0|point within the last hour or so, there 
20110109020829.000|20110109020832.000|TR0|has not been any significant change, not 
20110109020832.000|20110109020835.000|TR0|only in the congresswoman's condition, or 
20110109020835.000|20110109020838.000|TR0|in any of the other patients' condition. 
20110109020838.000|20110109020841.000|TR0|There are now five in critical and five in 
20110109020841.000|20110109020843.000|TR0|serious condition.  The critical patients 
20110109020843.000|20110109020846.000|TR0|here in the ICU unit here in the hospital, 
20110109020846.000|20110109020849.000|TR0|and that is also where the congresswoman 
20110109020849.000|20110109020852.000|TR0|is.
20110109020852.000|20110109020854.000|TR0|
20110109020854.000|20110109020857.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  Ted, we'll stay in 
20110109020857.000|20110109020900.000|TR0|close touch with you.  Stay in close 
20110109020900.000|20110109020903.000|TR0|touch.  You've got some more individuals 
20110109020903.000|20110109020906.000|TR0|who have been inside the hospital with the 
20110109020906.000|20110109020908.000|TR0|family, we would love to hear from them as 
20110109020908.000|20110109020911.000|TR0|well.
20110109020911.000|20110109020914.000|TR0|
20110109020914.000|20110109020917.000|TR0|We're just learning that the new house 
20110109020917.000|20110109020919.000|TR0|Speaker John Boehner will speak at 8:30 
20110109020919.000|20110109020922.000|TR0|a.m. Eastern tomorrow morning, he's 
20110109020922.000|20110109020925.000|TR0|already through -- the new majority leader 
20110109020925.000|20110109020928.000|TR0|in the House, Eric Cantor, announced, they 
20110109020928.000|20110109020931.000|TR0|are going to forego substantive 
20110109020931.000|20110109020933.000|TR0|controversial legislation next week, 
20110109020933.000|20110109020936.000|TR0|scheduled- they had schedule to vote to 
20110109020936.000|20110109020939.000|TR0|repeal the health care law for next 
20110109020939.000|20110109020942.000|TR0|Wednesday.  That's now been put on hold 
20110109020942.000|20110109020944.000|TR0|pending what's going on as a result of 
20110109020944.000|20110109020947.000|TR0|this assassination attempt, according to 
20110109020947.000|20110109020950.000|TR0|the sheriff, assassination attempt against 
20110109020950.000|20110109020953.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.
20110109020953.000|20110109020956.000|TR0|
20110109020956.000|20110109020958.000|TR0|We're going to continue our conversation 
20110109020958.000|20110109021001.000|TR0|with Doctor Steven Rayle.  He was at the 
20110109021001.000|20110109021004.000|TR0|scene, an eyewitness.  He was among those 
20110109021004.000|20110109021007.000|TR0|involved in holding the shooter down, 
20110109021007.000|20110109021010.000|TR0|after 19 individuals were shot.  We're 
20110109021010.000|20110109021012.000|TR0|going to get his eyewitness account of 
20110109021012.000|20110109021015.000|TR0|what happened and how he specifically got 
20110109021015.000|20110109021018.000|TR0|involved in dealing with the wounds to 
20110109021018.000|20110109021021.000|TR0|some of those who survived.
20110109021021.000|20110109021023.000|TR0|
20110109021023.000|20110109021026.000|TR0|Our conversation with Doctor Steven Rayle 
20110109021026.000|20110109021029.000|TR0|will continue right after this.
20110109021029.000|20110109021032.000|TR0|
20110109021032.000|20110109021035.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110109021035.000|20110109021037.000|TR0|
20110109021037.000|20110109021040.000|TR0|BLITZER:  A killing spree in Tucson, 
20110109021040.000|20110109021043.000|TR0|Arizona today; 19 victims, six confirmed 
20110109021043.000|20110109021046.000|TR0|dead, 13 injured, many of them critically 
20110109021046.000|20110109021048.000|TR0|injured, including Democratic 
20110109021048.000|20110109021051.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was 
20110109021051.000|20110109021054.000|TR0|just reelected to her third term only in 
20110109021054.000|20110109021057.000|TR0|November.
20110109021057.000|20110109021100.000|TR0|
20110109021100.000|20110109021102.000|TR0|Joining us once again on the phone from 
20110109021102.000|20110109021105.000|TR0|Phoenix, is Doctor Steven Rayle.  He was 
20110109021105.000|20110109021108.000|TR0|at the scene, he had gone to the event 
20110109021108.000|20110109021111.000|TR0|outside a Safeway in Tucson, wanted to 
20110109021111.000|20110109021113.000|TR0|meet the congresswoman for the first time, 
20110109021113.000|20110109021116.000|TR0|happened to be there when the shootings 
20110109021116.000|20110109021119.000|TR0|started.  He was among those who helped 
20110109021119.000|20110109021122.000|TR0|subdue the shooter in this case.
20110109021122.000|20110109021125.000|TR0|
20110109021125.000|20110109021127.000|TR0|Dr. Rayle, walk us through what happened.  
20110109021127.000|20110109021130.000|TR0|You're on the ground, you're holding down 
20110109021130.000|20110109021133.000|TR0|the shooter, you're waiting for law 
20110109021133.000|20110109021136.000|TR0|enforcement to arrive.  You're waiting for 
20110109021136.000|20110109021138.000|TR0|ambulances to arrive.  But you start 
20110109021138.000|20110109021141.000|TR0|helping to treat some of the victims.  
20110109021141.000|20110109021144.000|TR0|Tell us what happened.
20110109021144.000|20110109021147.000|TR0|
20110109021147.000|20110109021150.000|TR0|RAYLE:  Well, Wolf, in treating gunshot 
20110109021150.000|20110109021152.000|TR0|wound victims it's basically, you know, 
20110109021152.000|20110109021155.000|TR0|stopping the hemorrhage and getting EMS 
20110109021155.000|20110109021158.000|TR0|there as soon as possible.  That's 
20110109021158.000|20110109021201.000|TR0|basically the treatment.  There's not much 
20110109021201.000|20110109021203.000|TR0|else you can do.  Those who had actually 
20110109021203.000|20110109021206.000|TR0|stopped breathing, or had no pulse where 
20110109021206.000|20110109021209.000|TR0|CPR was initiated, it was pretty evident 
20110109021209.000|20110109021212.000|TR0|that very, very quickly, I think about 
20110109021212.000|20110109021215.000|TR0|three people looked to be mortally wounded 
20110109021215.000|20110109021217.000|TR0|if not dead already.  We did CPR on those.
20110109021217.000|20110109021220.000|TR0|
20110109021220.000|20110109021223.000|TR0|You know the scene was not as chaotic as 
20110109021223.000|20110109021226.000|TR0|you would think.  I mean it was 
20110109021226.000|20110109021228.000|TR0|disorganized.  When the shooting happened, 
20110109021228.000|20110109021231.000|TR0|there was not a lot of screams.  Basically 
20110109021231.000|20110109021234.000|TR0|so many people were shot, most of the 
20110109021234.000|20110109021237.000|TR0|people that were there were shot.  So 
20110109021237.000|20110109021240.000|TR0|those who were around close by, or right 
20110109021240.000|20110109021242.000|TR0|there like myself, who was not struck 
20110109021242.000|20110109021245.000|TR0|began to render aid.  But again, there's 
20110109021245.000|20110109021248.000|TR0|not a lot you can do.  It's just trying to 
20110109021248.000|20110109021251.000|TR0|stem the hemorrhage and give them any kind 
20110109021251.000|20110109021253.000|TR0|of support.
20110109021253.000|20110109021256.000|TR0|
20110109021256.000|20110109021259.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Congresswoman Giffords was shot 
20110109021259.000|20110109021302.000|TR0|point blank right into the head, the 
20110109021302.000|20110109021305.000|TR0|bullet went through her brain.  Did you 
20110109021305.000|20110109021307.000|TR0|see her lying on the ground?
20110109021307.000|20110109021310.000|TR0|
20110109021310.000|20110109021313.000|TR0|RAYLE:  I did.  I went and briefly checked 
20110109021313.000|20110109021316.000|TR0|on her.  She was being held up by one of 
20110109021316.000|20110109021318.000|TR0|her staffers, she was in a half sitting up 
20110109021318.000|20110109021321.000|TR0|position.  Her face was covered by a 
20110109021321.000|20110109021324.000|TR0|jacket.  She had blood on her face.  I 
20110109021324.000|20110109021327.000|TR0|could see that she was conscious and she 
20110109021327.000|20110109021330.000|TR0|was moving her hands and fingers and arm.  
20110109021330.000|20110109021332.000|TR0|So I was encouraged that she, you know, 
20110109021332.000|20110109021335.000|TR0|had not been fatally shot, at least 
20110109021335.000|20110109021338.000|TR0|immediately.  However, some of the other 
20110109021338.000|20110109021341.000|TR0|people definitely were shot, you know, and 
20110109021341.000|20110109021343.000|TR0|were fatally wounded.
20110109021343.000|20110109021346.000|TR0|
20110109021346.000|20110109021349.000|TR0|BLITZER:  How long did it take 
20110109021349.000|20110109021352.000|TR0|approximately for ambulances and emergency 
20110109021352.000|20110109021355.000|TR0|medical personnel to reach the scene?
20110109021355.000|20110109021357.000|TR0|
20110109021357.000|20110109021400.000|TR0|RAYLE:  You know, Wolf.  The medical -- 
20110109021400.000|20110109021403.000|TR0|the sheriffs, were there and it was at 
20110109021403.000|20110109021406.000|TR0|least another -- at least another 10, 
20110109021406.000|20110109021408.000|TR0|maybe 15 minutes, before any medical help 
20110109021408.000|20110109021411.000|TR0|arrived.  And people were asking where's 
20110109021411.000|20110109021414.000|TR0|the ambulance?  Where are they?  And I 
20110109021414.000|20110109021417.000|TR0|don't know.  I mean, again, I'm an 
20110109021417.000|20110109021420.000|TR0|emergency -- I was an emergency room 
20110109021420.000|20110109021422.000|TR0|physician.  And, you know, EMS are golden. 
20110109021422.000|20110109021425.000|TR0| I don't know where the holdup was, 
20110109021425.000|20110109021428.000|TR0|somehow in the communication.  Because the 
20110109021428.000|20110109021431.000|TR0|sheriff was there well before.  And, you 
20110109021431.000|20110109021433.000|TR0|know, once EMS got there, of course they 
20110109021433.000|20110109021436.000|TR0|took charge of the scene. But whatever 
20110109021436.000|20110109021439.000|TR0|caused that delay, I'm just wondering if, 
20110109021439.000|20110109021442.000|TR0|you know, lives could have been possibly 
20110109021442.000|20110109021445.000|TR0|saved during that delay.
20110109021445.000|20110109021447.000|TR0|
20110109021447.000|20110109021450.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And just tell us what you 
20110109021450.000|20110109021453.000|TR0|specifically were doing when you saw 
20110109021453.000|20110109021456.000|TR0|somebody lying on the ground, a bullet 
20110109021456.000|20110109021458.000|TR0|wound, you were trying to stop the 
20110109021458.000|20110109021501.000|TR0|bleeding?  Was that what you were doing?
20110109021501.000|20110109021504.000|TR0|
20110109021504.000|20110109021507.000|TR0|RAYLE:  I did nothing heroic, whatsoever.  
20110109021507.000|20110109021510.000|TR0|I mean, I was one of a number of people 
20110109021510.000|20110109021512.000|TR0|who were doing the same thing as I was, 
20110109021512.000|20110109021515.000|TR0|basically trying to render aid to these 
20110109021515.000|20110109021518.000|TR0|people that were stricken.  And, you know, 
20110109021518.000|20110109021521.000|TR0|having done emergency medicine, I was 
20110109021521.000|20110109021524.000|TR0|trying to get a sense of who, you know, 
20110109021524.000|20110109021526.000|TR0|triaging, who the attention should be 
20110109021526.000|20110109021529.000|TR0|focused on, who was already-I know one 
20110109021529.000|20110109021532.000|TR0|woman was asking for an AED, which in this 
20110109021532.000|20110109021535.000|TR0|case really won't do anything.  It's worth 
20110109021535.000|20110109021537.000|TR0|trying.  But, you know, again, with a 
20110109021537.000|20110109021540.000|TR0|trauma of a gunshot victim whose heart has 
20110109021540.000|20110109021543.000|TR0|stopped, it's really not going to be much 
20110109021543.000|20110109021546.000|TR0|hope, especially if EMS is not directly on 
20110109021546.000|20110109021549.000|TR0|the scene.
20110109021549.000|20110109021551.000|TR0|
20110109021551.000|20110109021554.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Tell our viewers what an AED is.
20110109021554.000|20110109021557.000|TR0|
20110109021557.000|20110109021600.000|TR0|RAYLE:  It's an automatic external 
20110109021600.000|20110109021602.000|TR0|defibrillator. So that is something that 
20110109021602.000|20110109021605.000|TR0|oftentimes is kept in public places, that 
20110109021605.000|20110109021608.000|TR0|can defibrillate the heart.  But if-
20110109021608.000|20110109021611.000|TR0|
20110109021611.000|20110109021614.000|TR0|BLITZER:  In case the heart stops.
20110109021614.000|20110109021616.000|TR0|
20110109021616.000|20110109021619.000|TR0|RAYLE:  In case the heart stops.  Again if 
20110109021619.000|20110109021622.000|TR0|someone has hemorrhaged to the point, or 
20110109021622.000|20110109021625.000|TR0|depending on where they're shot, it's a 
20110109021625.000|20110109021627.000|TR0|trauma victim and their heart stops within 
20110109021627.000|20110109021630.000|TR0|mens of the event, it's pretty much a 
20110109021630.000|20110109021633.000|TR0|foregone thing that they can be revived.  
20110109021633.000|20110109021636.000|TR0|Although, we always try. And people were 
20110109021636.000|20110109021639.000|TR0|doing CPR on people who were-I could tell 
20110109021639.000|20110109021641.000|TR0|were obviously too far gone.
20110109021641.000|20110109021644.000|TR0|
20110109021644.000|20110109021647.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And it really wasn't a very big 
20110109021647.000|20110109021650.000|TR0|crowd that had assembled at this meet and 
20110109021650.000|20110109021652.000|TR0|greet that she organized outside the 
20110109021652.000|20110109021655.000|TR0|Safeway. Approximately how many people do 
20110109021655.000|20110109021658.000|TR0|you believe were there?
20110109021658.000|20110109021701.000|TR0|
20110109021701.000|20110109021704.000|TR0|RAYLE:  There were probably 20 to 25, I 
20110109021704.000|20110109021706.000|TR0|think, were there.  So most of the people 
20110109021706.000|20110109021709.000|TR0|there got shot.
20110109021709.000|20110109021712.000|TR0|
20110109021712.000|20110109021715.000|TR0|BLITZER:  By the way, I just want to point 
20110109021715.000|20110109021717.000|TR0|out that the sheriff now says he misspoke, 
20110109021717.000|20110109021720.000|TR0|18 is the correct number of individuals 
20110109021720.000|20110109021723.000|TR0|that were shot.  Six of those 18 are 
20110109021723.000|20110109021726.000|TR0|confirmed dead.  Originally at the news 
20110109021726.000|20110109021729.000|TR0|conference he said 19 victims.  But they 
20110109021729.000|20110109021731.000|TR0|have now corrected it to 18. So what you 
20110109021731.000|20110109021734.000|TR0|are saying is that 20, 25 people were 
20110109021734.000|20110109021737.000|TR0|there and 18 of them were shot by this 
20110109021737.000|20110109021740.000|TR0|individual.  You're just very, very lucky, 
20110109021740.000|20110109021742.000|TR0|doctor, that you weren't one of them.
20110109021742.000|20110109021745.000|TR0|
20110109021745.000|20110109021748.000|TR0|RAYLE:  I believe so.  He started shooting 
20110109021748.000|20110109021751.000|TR0|and I-again, I froze for a second and then 
20110109021751.000|20110109021754.000|TR0|I jumped behind this concrete post and 
20110109021754.000|20110109021756.000|TR0|played dead for a moment.  But it wasn't 
20110109021756.000|20110109021759.000|TR0|one of those things where he was walking 
20110109021759.000|20110109021802.000|TR0|around picking out people to shoot.  He 
20110109021802.000|20110109021805.000|TR0|was just spraying gun fire and people were 
20110109021805.000|20110109021807.000|TR0|at close enough range that he was taking 
20110109021807.000|20110109021810.000|TR0|them out pretty effectively.
20110109021810.000|20110109021813.000|TR0|
20110109021813.000|20110109021816.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We also heard the sheriff 
20110109021816.000|20110109021819.000|TR0|say-and I want to be precise, Clarence 
20110109021819.000|20110109021821.000|TR0|Dupnik, he's the sheriff of Pima County, 
20110109021821.000|20110109021824.000|TR0|say that he doesn't necessarily believe 
20110109021824.000|20110109021827.000|TR0|this individual acted alone.  That there 
20110109021827.000|20110109021830.000|TR0|was a second person who was there with 
20110109021830.000|20110109021832.000|TR0|him, that is on the loose right now, he's 
20110109021832.000|20110109021835.000|TR0|at large, he's described as a person of 
20110109021835.000|20110109021838.000|TR0|interest.  Did you see a second person 
20110109021838.000|20110109021841.000|TR0|associated with this shooter?
20110109021841.000|20110109021844.000|TR0|
20110109021844.000|20110109021846.000|TR0|RAYLE:  I did not.  I mean this is just 
20110109021846.000|20110109021849.000|TR0|speculation, but I can't imagine the 
20110109021849.000|20110109021852.000|TR0|shooter would have expected to run -- 
20110109021852.000|20110109021855.000|TR0|there was nowhere for him to run.  I would 
20110109021855.000|20110109021857.000|TR0|have expected that there was somebody 
20110109021857.000|20110109021900.000|TR0|waiting for him in a car, or maybe he had 
20110109021900.000|20110109021903.000|TR0|his own car, but he didn't get away.
20110109021903.000|20110109021906.000|TR0|
20110109021906.000|20110109021909.000|TR0|I did hear-the man who had parked next to 
20110109021909.000|20110109021911.000|TR0|me was pulling in to the shopping center 
20110109021911.000|20110109021914.000|TR0|at the same time this was going down.  And 
20110109021914.000|20110109021917.000|TR0|he said that as they were pulling in, as 
20110109021917.000|20110109021920.000|TR0|the shooting was happening, at the very 
20110109021920.000|20110109021922.000|TR0|far end of the shopping center, there was 
20110109021922.000|20110109021925.000|TR0|a young man who looked to be at the same 
20110109021925.000|20110109021928.000|TR0|age as the shooter who was running as if 
20110109021928.000|20110109021931.000|TR0|for his life away.  And continued to run 
20110109021931.000|20110109021934.000|TR0|away from the shopping center.  And this 
20110109021934.000|20110109021936.000|TR0|would have been someone who -- he was 
20110109021936.000|20110109021939.000|TR0|wearing like a white shirt and dark pants, 
20110109021939.000|20110109021942.000|TR0|the man's wife actually commented to her 
20110109021942.000|20110109021945.000|TR0|husband saying oh, I wonder what he just 
20110109021945.000|20110109021947.000|TR0|stole, he's really running.
20110109021947.000|20110109021950.000|TR0|
20110109021950.000|20110109021953.000|TR0|So I can imagine that this young man 
20110109021953.000|20110109021956.000|TR0|somehow was a part of this.  And, you 
20110109021956.000|20110109021959.000|TR0|know, by the time the police got there, he 
20110109021959.000|20110109022001.000|TR0|was long gone.
20110109022001.000|20110109022004.000|TR0|
20110109022004.000|20110109022007.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Doctor Steven Rayle is a Tucson 
20110109022007.000|20110109022010.000|TR0|doctor who wanted to meet this 
20110109022010.000|20110109022013.000|TR0|congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, went to 
20110109022013.000|20110109022015.000|TR0|the event this morning.  And we're hearing 
20110109022015.000|20110109022018.000|TR0|his eyewitness account.
20110109022018.000|20110109022021.000|TR0|
20110109022021.000|20110109022024.000|TR0|Doctor if you can stay with us, I want to 
20110109022024.000|20110109022026.000|TR0|continue this conversation. Donna Brazile 
20110109022026.000|20110109022029.000|TR0|is here, Roland Martin is here.  We're 
20110109022029.000|20110109022032.000|TR0|getting other information coming in as 
20110109022032.000|20110109022035.000|TR0|well.  Doctor Rayle, stand by our coverage 
20110109022035.000|20110109022038.000|TR0|will continue right after this.

20110109022046.000|20110109022049.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We're following the breaking 
20110109022049.000|20110109022051.000|TR0|news, a horrible story out of Tucson, 
20110109022051.000|20110109022054.000|TR0|Arizona today, 18 individuals shot, six 
20110109022054.000|20110109022057.000|TR0|killed in a shooting spree over at a 
20110109022057.000|20110109022100.000|TR0|Safeway, at a shopping center.  
20110109022100.000|20110109022103.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords among 
20110109022103.000|20110109022105.000|TR0|those shot; she is in critical condition. 
20110109022105.000|20110109022108.000|TR0|Her doctors are cautiously optimistic that 
20110109022108.000|20110109022111.000|TR0|she will survive.

20110109022114.000|20110109022116.000|TR0|The sheriff in Pima County, in Tucson, 
20110109022116.000|20110109022119.000|TR0|Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, spoke out just a 
20110109022119.000|20110109022122.000|TR0|while ago and he blamed some of the 
20110109022122.000|20110109022125.000|TR0|political rhetoric out there for causing 
20110109022125.000|20110109022128.000|TR0|crazy people to respond.  Listen to this.

20110109022139.000|20110109022141.000|TR0|ARIZONA:  People tend to poo- poo this 
20110109022141.000|20110109022144.000|TR0|business about all the vitriol that we 
20110109022144.000|20110109022147.000|TR0|hear inflaming the American public by 
20110109022147.000|20110109022150.000|TR0|people who make a living off of doing 
20110109022150.000|20110109022153.000|TR0|that.  But that may be free speech, but 
20110109022153.000|20110109022155.000|TR0|it's not without consequences.

20110109022204.000|20110109022206.000|TR0|BLITZER:  He went on to say that Arizona, 
20110109022206.000|20110109022209.000|TR0|in his words, "has become sort of a 
20110109022209.000|20110109022212.000|TR0|capital, we have become Mecca for 
20110109022212.000|20110109022215.000|TR0|prejudice and bigotry. There's reason to 
20110109022215.000|20110109022218.000|TR0|believe that this individual may have had 
20110109022218.000|20110109022220.000|TR0|a mental issue.  And I think that people 
20110109022220.000|20110109022223.000|TR0|who are unbalanced are especially 
20110109022223.000|20110109022226.000|TR0|susceptible to vitriol."  That's the 
20110109022226.000|20110109022229.000|TR0|Sheriff of Pima County.

20110109022234.000|20110109022237.000|TR0|here, our CNN contributors.
20110109022237.000|20110109022240.000|TR0|
20110109022240.000|20110109022243.000|TR0|Donna, first of all, Congresswoman 
20110109022243.000|20110109022245.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords, you know her. You know 
20110109022245.000|20110109022248.000|TR0|her quite well.  And by all accounts 
20110109022248.000|20110109022251.000|TR0|beloved here in Washington by Democrats 
20110109022251.000|20110109022254.000|TR0|and Republicans.
20110109022254.000|20110109022256.000|TR0|
20110109022256.000|20110109022259.000|TR0|DONNA BRAZILE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  She's a 
20110109022259.000|20110109022302.000|TR0|terrific lawmaker, Wolf.  She goes home 
20110109022302.000|20110109022305.000|TR0|every weekend, she enjoys having these 
20110109022305.000|20110109022308.000|TR0|"Congress On Your Corner" where basically 
20110109022308.000|20110109022310.000|TR0|members of the public line up to come and 
20110109022310.000|20110109022313.000|TR0|talk to their member of Congress.  She is 
20110109022313.000|20110109022316.000|TR0|such a wonderful person to work with, the 
20110109022316.000|20110109022319.000|TR0|people love her on Capitol Hill.  And let 
20110109022319.000|20110109022321.000|TR0|me tell you, she is the co-chair of the 
20110109022321.000|20110109022324.000|TR0|Motorcycle Caucus up on Capitol Hill, the 
20110109022324.000|20110109022327.000|TR0|Motorcycle Safety Caucus.  So she's 
20110109022327.000|20110109022330.000|TR0|constantly talking to people across the 
20110109022330.000|20110109022333.000|TR0|political divide, and she's one person who 
20110109022333.000|20110109022335.000|TR0|believes that as a lawmaker, you got to go 
20110109022335.000|20110109022338.000|TR0|out there, you got to meet with your 
20110109022338.000|20110109022341.000|TR0|constituents.  And that's clearly one of 
20110109022341.000|20110109022344.000|TR0|the reasons why she left Washington to go 
20110109022344.000|20110109022346.000|TR0|home and continue to serve her 
20110109022346.000|20110109022349.000|TR0|constituents.
20110109022349.000|20110109022352.000|TR0|
20110109022352.000|20110109022355.000|TR0|BLITZER:  You Roland, just spent some time 
20110109022355.000|20110109022358.000|TR0|with her and her husband?
20110109022358.000|20110109022400.000|TR0|
20110109022400.000|20110109022403.000|TR0|ROLAND MARTIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  I did 
20110109022403.000|20110109022406.000|TR0|some time with her and her husband.  And 
20110109022406.000|20110109022409.000|TR0|opportunity to talk with them, share with 
20110109022409.000|20110109022411.000|TR0|them.  Just a really pleasant woman.  I 
20110109022411.000|20110109022414.000|TR0|mean, someone who-she's always smiling, 
20110109022414.000|20110109022417.000|TR0|she's always upbeat.  I think people also 
20110109022417.000|20110109022420.000|TR0|forget that members of Congress are real 
20110109022420.000|20110109022423.000|TR0|people, they have families.  I mean, her 
20110109022423.000|20110109022425.000|TR0|husband, Commander Kelly, he's the only 
20110109022425.000|20110109022428.000|TR0|active military spouse of all of the 
20110109022428.000|20110109022431.000|TR0|United States Congress.  I had a chance to 
20110109022431.000|20110109022434.000|TR0|meet his daughter as well. And so here are 
20110109022434.000|20110109022436.000|TR0|folks who choose public service.  Here a 
20110109022436.000|20110109022439.000|TR0|guy in the military, astronaut, folks who 
20110109022439.000|20110109022442.000|TR0|truly believe in where this country is 
20110109022442.000|20110109022445.000|TR0|going.
20110109022445.000|20110109022448.000|TR0|
20110109022448.000|20110109022450.000|TR0|And so when the sheriff talks about the 
20110109022450.000|20110109022453.000|TR0|level of rhetoric that we're hearing, that 
20110109022453.000|20110109022456.000|TR0|frankly has been ratcheted, I believe, 
20110109022456.000|20110109022459.000|TR0|since the election of President Barack 
20110109022459.000|20110109022501.000|TR0|Obama.  When you listen to these people 
20110109022501.000|20110109022504.000|TR0|talk about the end days, end of the world, 
20110109022504.000|20110109022507.000|TR0|how this country is being destroyed, and 
20110109022507.000|20110109022510.000|TR0|the whole sense of destruction.  The 
20110109022510.000|20110109022513.000|TR0|sheriff is right. There are consequences 
20110109022513.000|20110109022515.000|TR0|to what you say.  And it has gotten so 
20110109022515.000|20110109022518.000|TR0|overheated that it's stunningly 
20110109022518.000|20110109022521.000|TR0|unbelievable.  And I think the individuals 
20110109022521.000|20110109022524.000|TR0|who say this on television and radio have 
20110109022524.000|20110109022527.000|TR0|to understand that there are people out 
20110109022527.000|20110109022529.000|TR0|there who listen to them, who believe what 
20110109022529.000|20110109022532.000|TR0|they say.  And they don't parse politics, 
20110109022532.000|20110109022535.000|TR0|they simply see what they consider to be 
20110109022535.000|20110109022538.000|TR0|evil and good.  And so for this to be, 
20110109022538.000|20110109022540.000|TR0|this political assassination, and not just 
20110109022540.000|20110109022543.000|TR0|her, a federal judge is dead, a child is 
20110109022543.000|20110109022546.000|TR0|dead, others are dead.  Aids shot as well. 
20110109022546.000|20110109022549.000|TR0| This is a scary thought for any member of 
20110109022549.000|20110109022552.000|TR0|Congress.
20110109022552.000|20110109022554.000|TR0|
20110109022554.000|20110109022557.000|TR0|BLITZER:  A nine-year-old child is dead.  
20110109022557.000|20110109022600.000|TR0|Gabe Zimmerman, a long-time aid to 
20110109022600.000|20110109022603.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords is dead, as well.
20110109022603.000|20110109022605.000|TR0|
20110109022605.000|20110109022608.000|TR0|Tom Fuentes is our CNN contributor, a 
20110109022608.000|20110109022611.000|TR0|former assistant director of the FBI.
20110109022611.000|20110109022614.000|TR0|
20110109022614.000|20110109022617.000|TR0|The sheriff minced no words there in 
20110109022617.000|20110109022619.000|TR0|talking about vitriol and the impact it 
20110109022619.000|20110109022622.000|TR0|could have on unstable individuals out 
20110109022622.000|20110109022625.000|TR0|there.  You have spent a career in law 
20110109022625.000|20110109022628.000|TR0|enforcement, Tom, when you heard the 
20110109022628.000|20110109022630.000|TR0|sheriff say that, what did you think?
20110109022630.000|20110109022633.000|TR0|
20110109022633.000|20110109022636.000|TR0|TOM FUENTES, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  I was a 
20110109022636.000|20110109022639.000|TR0|little bit surprised that he was as 
20110109022639.000|20110109022642.000|TR0|emotional as he was about that.  And I 
20110109022642.000|20110109022644.000|TR0|think this makes a very important point.  
20110109022644.000|20110109022647.000|TR0|You know, when CNN or other media cover 
20110109022647.000|20110109022650.000|TR0|the public statements made by public 
20110109022650.000|20110109022653.000|TR0|officials or radio or television 
20110109022653.000|20110109022655.000|TR0|personalities that are hateful that talk 
20110109022655.000|20110109022658.000|TR0|about taking violent action, or very close 
20110109022658.000|20110109022701.000|TR0|to violent rhetoric, they don't realize, 
20110109022701.000|20110109022704.000|TR0|we just attribute that to they're exciting 
20110109022704.000|20110109022707.000|TR0|their base.  Oh, this is just part of 
20110109022707.000|20110109022709.000|TR0|their political discourse.
20110109022709.000|20110109022712.000|TR0|
20110109022712.000|20110109022715.000|TR0|And law enforcement executives out there 
20110109022715.000|20110109022718.000|TR0|know, like this sheriff, that it also 
20110109022718.000|20110109022720.000|TR0|excites the lunatic fringe.  And 
20110109022720.000|20110109022723.000|TR0|unfortunately in this country, and 
20110109022723.000|20110109022726.000|TR0|actually throughout the world, but in this 
20110109022726.000|20110109022729.000|TR0|country, we have no shortage of mentally 
20110109022729.000|20110109022732.000|TR0|unbalanced people.  And it seems, in case 
20110109022732.000|20110109022734.000|TR0|after case, they have no trouble obtaining 
20110109022734.000|20110109022737.000|TR0|firearms, so when they go over the edge 
20110109022737.000|20110109022740.000|TR0|and go public, and try to initiate an 
20110109022740.000|20110109022743.000|TR0|attack, this is what happens.
20110109022743.000|20110109022745.000|TR0|
20110109022745.000|20110109022748.000|TR0|In this case it was a very emotional 
20110109022748.000|20110109022751.000|TR0|response by a very frustrated, hurt 
20110109022751.000|20110109022754.000|TR0|sheriff that was in pain because of what's 
20110109022754.000|20110109022757.000|TR0|happened to his community, and to friends 
20110109022757.000|20110109022759.000|TR0|of his, such as the congresswoman and the 
20110109022759.000|20110109022802.000|TR0|judge and others.
20110109022802.000|20110109022805.000|TR0|
20110109022805.000|20110109022808.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Tom, we heard the sheriff say, 
20110109022808.000|20110109022810.000|TR0|pointblank that this individual had mental 
20110109022810.000|20110109022813.000|TR0|issues, had a criminal record, yet now we 
20110109022813.000|20110109022816.000|TR0|have confirmed here at CNN that this 
20110109022816.000|20110109022819.000|TR0|individual, Jared Lee Loughner, who is the 
20110109022819.000|20110109022822.000|TR0|suspected shooter in this case, 22 years 
20110109022822.000|20110109022824.000|TR0|old, legally purchased this Glock 19 
20110109022824.000|20110109022827.000|TR0|semi-automatic pistol only the other day 
20110109022827.000|20110109022830.000|TR0|in Arizona.
20110109022830.000|20110109022833.000|TR0|
20110109022833.000|20110109022835.000|TR0|The question to you is: is that normal 
20110109022835.000|20110109022838.000|TR0|that someone could buy a semiautomatic 
20110109022838.000|20110109022841.000|TR0|weapon in Arizona even though they have a 
20110109022841.000|20110109022844.000|TR0|criminal background and a history of 
20110109022844.000|20110109022847.000|TR0|mental illness as the sheriff says this 
20110109022847.000|20110109022849.000|TR0|individual has?
20110109022849.000|20110109022852.000|TR0|
20110109022852.000|20110109022855.000|TR0|TOM FUENTES, FORMER ASST. FBI DIRECTOR:  I 
20110109022855.000|20110109022858.000|TR0|think my comment to that would be" what's 
20110109022858.000|20110109022900.000|TR0|new?  I mean, we've seen this in other 
20110109022900.000|20110109022903.000|TR0|cases as well. The Virginia Tech massacre, 
20110109022903.000|20110109022906.000|TR0|that individual went into a Roanoke, 
20110109022906.000|20110109022909.000|TR0|Virginia gun shop and had no trouble 
20110109022909.000|20110109022912.000|TR0|obtaining the firearms and the ammunition 
20110109022912.000|20110109022914.000|TR0|even though he had been diagnosed as 
20110109022914.000|20110109022917.000|TR0|mentally unstable.
20110109022917.000|20110109022920.000|TR0|
20110109022920.000|20110109022923.000|TR0|BLITZER:  But I don't believe that 
20110109022923.000|20110109022925.000|TR0|individual had a criminal background.  In 
20110109022925.000|20110109022928.000|TR0|this particular case, the sheriff says the 
20110109022928.000|20110109022931.000|TR0|individual had a criminal record.
20110109022931.000|20110109022934.000|TR0|
20110109022934.000|20110109022937.000|TR0|FUENTES:  Well, I don't know whether 
20110109022937.000|20110109022939.000|TR0|that's prohibited by Arizona law to 
20110109022939.000|20110109022942.000|TR0|prevent him.  But I'm just saying that 
20110109022942.000|20110109022945.000|TR0|individuals who are very unstable 
20110109022945.000|20110109022948.000|TR0|apparently have no trouble obtaining a 
20110109022948.000|20110109022950.000|TR0|firearm and using it.
20110109022950.000|20110109022953.000|TR0|
20110109022953.000|20110109022956.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And I want to bring Donna in, 
20110109022956.000|20110109022959.000|TR0|because we don't know -- we see the 
20110109022959.000|20110109023002.000|TR0|rambling, the statements of this 
20110109023002.000|20110109023004.000|TR0|individual, the suspected shooter, Jared 
20110109023004.000|20110109023007.000|TR0|Lee Loughner, made on the Internet.  We 
20110109023007.000|20110109023010.000|TR0|don't know if he's from the lunatic right 
20110109023010.000|20110109023013.000|TR0|or from the lunatic left.  We just see a 
20110109023013.000|20110109023016.000|TR0|bunch of crazy words that are there.
20110109023016.000|20110109023018.000|TR0|
20110109023018.000|20110109023021.000|TR0|So, we have no idea whom they have 
20110109023021.000|20110109023024.000|TR0|motivated him, where he was coming from, 
20110109023024.000|20110109023027.000|TR0|if he was -- in fact, he's still alive, 
20110109023027.000|20110109023029.000|TR0|he's in the in place custody.  The sheriff 
20110109023029.000|20110109023032.000|TR0|says he's taken his rights -- he's invoked 
20110109023032.000|20110109023035.000|TR0|his rights, he's not cooperating with the 
20110109023035.000|20110109023038.000|TR0|investigation.  So, we don't know what his 
20110109023038.000|20110109023041.000|TR0|politics.
20110109023041.000|20110109023043.000|TR0|
20110109023043.000|20110109023046.000|TR0|DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I 
20110109023046.000|20110109023049.000|TR0|think it's too soon to draw any 
20110109023049.000|20110109023052.000|TR0|conclusions about the suspect or suspects 
20110109023052.000|20110109023054.000|TR0|out there.  I think everyone at this time 
20110109023054.000|20110109023057.000|TR0|is praying for the congresswoman, praying 
20110109023057.000|20110109023100.000|TR0|for those who have been injured, praying 
20110109023100.000|20110109023103.000|TR0|for those who have been killed. And I 
20110109023103.000|20110109023106.000|TR0|think in the coming days, we'll have -- 
20110109023106.000|20110109023108.000|TR0|we'll have a lot of discussion about the 
20110109023108.000|20110109023111.000|TR0|heated political rhetoric and what role 
20110109023111.000|20110109023114.000|TR0|that might have played and the gun laws.
20110109023114.000|20110109023117.000|TR0|
20110109023117.000|20110109023119.000|TR0|But, for now, I think everyone is just 
20110109023119.000|20110109023122.000|TR0|focused on the healing that needs to take 
20110109023122.000|20110109023125.000|TR0|place there in Tucson. ROLAND MARTIN, CNN 
20110109023125.000|20110109023128.000|TR0|CONTRIBUTOR:  But we cannot forget the 
20110109023128.000|20110109023131.000|TR0|fact that even she talked about the death 
20110109023131.000|20110109023133.000|TR0|threats, she talked about her office being 
20110109023133.000|20110109023136.000|TR0|attacked.  When you talk about, you know, 
20110109023136.000|20110109023139.000|TR0|this whole notion of, I think it's Sarah 
20110109023139.000|20110109023142.000|TR0|Palin's Web page, where there was a scope, 
20110109023142.000|20110109023144.000|TR0|he was one of the members targeted for 
20110109023144.000|20110109023147.000|TR0|defeat.  She just had a very difficult 
20110109023147.000|20110109023150.000|TR0|re-election campaign.
20110109023150.000|20110109023153.000|TR0|
20110109023153.000|20110109023156.000|TR0|And so, when you're talking about a member 
20110109023156.000|20110109023158.000|TR0|of Congress, when you say, wait a minute, 
20110109023158.000|20110109023201.000|TR0|I'm getting death threats because I'm 
20110109023201.000|20110109023204.000|TR0|taking a political position?  What does 
20110109023204.000|20110109023207.000|TR0|that say about our country when that is 
20110109023207.000|20110109023209.000|TR0|happening?  And also as the sheriff said, 
20110109023209.000|20110109023212.000|TR0|who's then going to want to serve?  Who's 
20110109023212.000|20110109023215.000|TR0|then want to -- who's going to want to 
20110109023215.000|20110109023218.000|TR0|step out there and put their life on the 
20110109023218.000|20110109023221.000|TR0|line solely for the purpose of saying I 
20110109023221.000|20110109023223.000|TR0|want to represent the constituents.
20110109023223.000|20110109023226.000|TR0|
20110109023226.000|20110109023229.000|TR0|That's -- I mean, this is so much broader 
20110109023229.000|20110109023232.000|TR0|than just in terms of the immediate 
20110109023232.000|20110109023234.000|TR0|impact.  The chilling effect on political 
20110109023234.000|20110109023237.000|TR0|officials all across this country, 
20110109023237.000|20110109023240.000|TR0|congressional, local, and state as well.
20110109023240.000|20110109023243.000|TR0|
20110109023243.000|20110109023246.000|TR0|BRAZILE:  But as Americans, we should all 
20110109023246.000|20110109023248.000|TR0|work to restore civility in the public 
20110109023248.000|20110109023251.000|TR0|space, because that's what's missing today 
20110109023251.000|20110109023254.000|TR0|in al of our conversations.
20110109023254.000|20110109023257.000|TR0|
20110109023257.000|20110109023259.000|TR0|MARTIN:  Yes, agree or disagree.

20110109023302.000|20110109023305.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, guys, stand by 
20110109023305.000|20110109023308.000|TR0|because we're going to continue our

20110109023316.000|20110109023319.000|TR0|We're going to go back to Dr. Steven Riley 
20110109023319.000|20110109023322.000|TR0|(ph), who was an eyewitness.  He was at 
20110109023322.000|20110109023324.000|TR0|the scene when the shooting took place.  
20110109023324.000|20110109023327.000|TR0|He was involved in subduing the shooter, 
20110109023327.000|20110109023330.000|TR0|and then he was involved in helping save 
20110109023330.000|20110109023333.000|TR0|lives at this shopping center outside of

20110109023409.000|20110109023412.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Jeanne Meserve is here.  She's 
20110109023412.000|20110109023414.000|TR0|getting new information on the suspected 
20110109023414.000|20110109023417.000|TR0|shooter in this case.

20110109023420.000|20110109023423.000|TR0|Jeanne, what are you learning?

20110109023426.000|20110109023428.000|TR0|JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY 
20110109023428.000|20110109023431.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, we've been 
20110109023431.000|20110109023434.000|TR0|asking a lot of questions about this 
20110109023434.000|20110109023437.000|TR0|second shooter that we heard the sheriff 
20110109023437.000|20110109023439.000|TR0|reference.  According to a law enforcement 
20110109023439.000|20110109023442.000|TR0|source who we've been spoken to, officials 
20110109023442.000|20110109023445.000|TR0|don't really know if this individual who 
20110109023445.000|20110109023448.000|TR0|they are looking for knew Loughner or had 
20110109023448.000|20110109023451.000|TR0|any connection with him.  This law 
20110109023451.000|20110109023453.000|TR0|enforcement sources says they do have a 
20110109023453.000|20110109023456.000|TR0|piece of evidence that places him near 
20110109023456.000|20110109023459.000|TR0|that store where the shootings took place. 
20110109023459.000|20110109023502.000|TR0| But at this point in time, they're 
20110109023502.000|20110109023505.000|TR0|talking to witnesses who were there to see 
20110109023505.000|20110109023507.000|TR0|if there's a connection between the two 
20110109023507.000|20110109023510.000|TR0|and, of course, obviously, trying to 
20110109023510.000|20110109023513.000|TR0|pursue this individual.
20110109023513.000|20110109023516.000|TR0|
20110109023516.000|20110109023518.000|TR0|In addition, according to this law 
20110109023518.000|20110109023521.000|TR0|enforcement source, they are seeking 
20110109023521.000|20110109023524.000|TR0|search warrants at this hour for both a 
20110109023524.000|20110109023527.000|TR0|residence and a vehicle.  At this point in 
20110109023527.000|20110109023530.000|TR0|them, they don't have them in hand, but 
20110109023530.000|20110109023532.000|TR0|they're trying to get those, of course, as 
20110109023532.000|20110109023535.000|TR0|quickly as they can. Meanwhile, evidence 
20110109023535.000|20110109023538.000|TR0|technicians are still working that scene 
20110109023538.000|20110109023541.000|TR0|trying to get more.
20110109023541.000|20110109023543.000|TR0|
20110109023543.000|20110109023546.000|TR0|We've talked to a separate law enforcement 
20110109023546.000|20110109023549.000|TR0|source who tells us that Glock that was 
20110109023549.000|20110109023552.000|TR0|used by Loughner in these shootings was 
20110109023552.000|20110109023555.000|TR0|obtained legally.  It is the opinion of 
20110109023555.000|20110109023557.000|TR0|this law enforcement source that he likely 
20110109023557.000|20110109023600.000|TR0|bought the extended magazine that we've 
20110109023600.000|20110109023603.000|TR0|heard talked about separately from the gun 
20110109023603.000|20110109023606.000|TR0|itself.
20110109023606.000|20110109023608.000|TR0|
20110109023608.000|20110109023611.000|TR0|In addition, this law enforcement source 
20110109023611.000|20110109023614.000|TR0|tells us that the suspect had purchased 
20110109023614.000|20110109023617.000|TR0|another gun a few years ago, but law 
20110109023617.000|20110109023620.000|TR0|enforcement at this point in time doesn't 
20110109023620.000|20110109023622.000|TR0|know if he still had it in his possession.
20110109023622.000|20110109023625.000|TR0|
20110109023625.000|20110109023628.000|TR0|And moving on, to YouTube, which, as you 
20110109023628.000|20110109023631.000|TR0|know, is often a window into the minds of 
20110109023631.000|20110109023633.000|TR0|individuals in these kinds of cases.  This 
20110109023633.000|20110109023636.000|TR0|-- there are YouTube postings by someone 
20110109023636.000|20110109023639.000|TR0|by the name of Jared Loughner.  We believe 
20110109023639.000|20110109023642.000|TR0|it is the same individual because we were 
20110109023642.000|20110109023645.000|TR0|referenced to these pages by law 
20110109023645.000|20110109023647.000|TR0|enforcement and they were taken down after 
20110109023647.000|20110109023650.000|TR0|he was named as a suspect.
20110109023650.000|20110109023653.000|TR0|
20110109023653.000|20110109023656.000|TR0|In one of them, I'd like to read to you, 
20110109023656.000|20110109023658.000|TR0|it's called "Introduction Jared Loughner." 
20110109023658.000|20110109023701.000|TR0| It starts saying, "My final thoughts.  
20110109023701.000|20110109023704.000|TR0|Jared Lee Loughner, most people who read 
20110109023704.000|20110109023707.000|TR0|this text forget that in the next two 
20110109023707.000|20110109023710.000|TR0|seconds, the population of dreamers in the 
20110109023710.000|20110109023712.000|TR0|United States of America is less than 5 
20110109023712.000|20110109023715.000|TR0|percent."
20110109023715.000|20110109023718.000|TR0|
20110109023718.000|20110109023721.000|TR0|He then goes on to ramble at length about 
20110109023721.000|20110109023723.000|TR0|the government and about currency and any 
20110109023723.000|20110109023726.000|TR0|number of other subjects.  But a second 
20110109023726.000|20110109023729.000|TR0|posting in here that's kind of 
20110109023729.000|20110109023732.000|TR0|interesting.  He talks about going to a 
20110109023732.000|20110109023735.000|TR0|military entrance processing station known 
20110109023735.000|20110109023737.000|TR0|as MEPS in Phoenix.  It said he received a 
20110109023737.000|20110109023740.000|TR0|mini-Bible before the test.  "I didn't 
20110109023740.000|20110109023743.000|TR0|write a belief on my Army application and 
20110109023743.000|20110109023746.000|TR0|the recruiter wrote on the application, 
20110109023746.000|20110109023748.000|TR0|'none.'"
20110109023748.000|20110109023751.000|TR0|
20110109023751.000|20110109023754.000|TR0|Now, our Barbara Starr has spoken to the 
20110109023754.000|20110109023757.000|TR0|U.S. Army, and they have given us a 
20110109023757.000|20110109023800.000|TR0|statement.  The Army has confirmed that 
20110109023800.000|20110109023802.000|TR0|the suspect was never in the Army.  He 
20110109023802.000|20110109023805.000|TR0|attempted to enlist in the Army but was 
20110109023805.000|20110109023808.000|TR0|rejected for service.  In accordance with 
20110109023808.000|20110109023811.000|TR0|the Privacy Act, we will not discuss 
20110109023811.000|20110109023813.000|TR0|exactly why he was rejected.
20110109023813.000|20110109023816.000|TR0|
20110109023816.000|20110109023819.000|TR0|And then a third YouTube posting from this 
20110109023819.000|20110109023822.000|TR0|individual, Jared Loughner, which is kind 
20110109023822.000|20110109023825.000|TR0|of interesting, in which he references 
20110109023825.000|20110109023827.000|TR0|specifically the district, the 
20110109023827.000|20110109023830.000|TR0|congressional district where 
20110109023830.000|20110109023833.000|TR0|Representative Giffords served.  It says, 
20110109023833.000|20110109023836.000|TR0|"The majority of people who reside in 
20110109023836.000|20110109023838.000|TR0|district 8 are illiterate, hilarious.  I 
20110109023838.000|20110109023841.000|TR0|don't control your English grammar 
20110109023841.000|20110109023844.000|TR0|structure, but you control your English 
20110109023844.000|20110109023847.000|TR0|grammar structure."  And then he goes on 
20110109023847.000|20110109023850.000|TR0|and on and on.
20110109023850.000|20110109023852.000|TR0|
20110109023852.000|20110109023855.000|TR0|Another interesting thing that we've come 
20110109023855.000|20110109023858.000|TR0|across here is his postings of his 
20110109023858.000|20110109023901.000|TR0|favorite books, Wolf.  It's an interesting 
20110109023901.000|20110109023903.000|TR0|collection.  It includes some political 
20110109023903.000|20110109023906.000|TR0|tracks, including "Mein Kampf," and "The 
20110109023906.000|20110109023909.000|TR0|Communist Manifesto."  But also a lot of 
20110109023909.000|20110109023912.000|TR0|fantasy here and a lot of other political 
20110109023912.000|20110109023915.000|TR0|books like "Animal Farm," "Fahrenheit 
20110109023915.000|20110109023917.000|TR0|451."  But in there also, "Peter Pan," 
20110109023917.000|20110109023920.000|TR0|"Alice in Wonderland," "Wizard of Oz," 
20110109023920.000|20110109023923.000|TR0|things that you might not expect a young 
20110109023923.000|20110109023926.000|TR0|man of 22 years old have posted as his 
20110109023926.000|20110109023928.000|TR0|favorite books, Wolf.
20110109023928.000|20110109023931.000|TR0|
20110109023931.000|20110109023934.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So, in going through all the 
20110109023934.000|20110109023937.000|TR0|rambling, the books, the favorite books, 
20110109023937.000|20110109023940.000|TR0|the documents, whatever, does it look like 
20110109023940.000|20110109023942.000|TR0|he was a lunatic from the extreme left or 
20110109023942.000|20110109023945.000|TR0|from the extreme right?  If you're -- 
20110109023945.000|20110109023948.000|TR0|you've got "The Communist Manifesto" in 
20110109023948.000|20110109023951.000|TR0|there and you got "Mein Kampf" in there, 
20110109023951.000|20110109023953.000|TR0|you're spanning the entire political 
20110109023953.000|20110109023956.000|TR0|spectrum, if you will.
20110109023956.000|20110109023959.000|TR0|
20110109023959.000|20110109024002.000|TR0|MESERVE:  You know, I'm reluctant to use 
20110109024002.000|20110109024005.000|TR0|the word lunatic.  We did hear the sheriff 
20110109024005.000|20110109024007.000|TR0|said that this was a man who he thought 
20110109024007.000|20110109024010.000|TR0|had some mental issues.  These writings 
20110109024010.000|20110109024013.000|TR0|would seem to reflect that.  But as to 
20110109024013.000|20110109024016.000|TR0|what edge of the political spectrum they 
20110109024016.000|20110109024019.000|TR0|come from, they're so jumbled.  Quite 
20110109024019.000|20110109024021.000|TR0|frankly, it's very hard to tell.  But he 
20110109024021.000|20110109024024.000|TR0|does express his dissatisfaction with the 
20110109024024.000|20110109024027.000|TR0|police, with the Constitution, and with 
20110109024027.000|20110109024030.000|TR0|district 8, this specific district at --
20110109024030.000|20110109024032.000|TR0|
20110109024032.000|20110109024035.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I wonder, Gabrielle Giffords is 
20110109024035.000|20110109024038.000|TR0|Jewish, is there anything anti-Semitic in 
20110109024038.000|20110109024041.000|TR0|there other than "Mein Kampf," and the 
20110109024041.000|20110109024044.000|TR0|references to Hitler or anything that 
20110109024044.000|20110109024046.000|TR0|would suggest an anti-Semitic motive there?
20110109024046.000|20110109024049.000|TR0|
20110109024049.000|20110109024052.000|TR0|MESERVE:  I have not come across that, 
20110109024052.000|20110109024055.000|TR0|Wolf.  I will read this again and look 
20110109024055.000|20110109024057.000|TR0|again.  But I haven't seen that.
20110109024057.000|20110109024100.000|TR0|
20110109024100.000|20110109024103.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Jeanne, thanks very, very much.
20110109024103.000|20110109024106.000|TR0|
20110109024106.000|20110109024109.000|TR0|Ted Rowlands is over at the hospital at 
20110109024109.000|20110109024111.000|TR0|the University Medical Center in Tucson, 
20110109024111.000|20110109024114.000|TR0|where Congresswoman Giffords underwent 
20110109024114.000|20110109024117.000|TR0|hours of surgery today.
20110109024117.000|20110109024120.000|TR0|
20110109024120.000|20110109024122.000|TR0|You're getting more information, Ted.  
20110109024122.000|20110109024125.000|TR0|Update our viewers.
20110109024125.000|20110109024128.000|TR0|
20110109024128.000|20110109024131.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110109024131.000|20110109024134.000|TR0|Wolf, we've been talking to people who 
20110109024134.000|20110109024136.000|TR0|have been here all day, friends and family 
20110109024136.000|20110109024139.000|TR0|of the congresswoman and people that have 
20110109024139.000|20110109024142.000|TR0|been inside the hospital, one of those 
20110109024142.000|20110109024145.000|TR0|people is Steve Farley.  He actually holds 
20110109024145.000|20110109024147.000|TR0|the seat that Gabrielle gave up when she 
20110109024147.000|20110109024150.000|TR0|went to national politics here locally.
20110109024150.000|20110109024153.000|TR0|
20110109024153.000|20110109024156.000|TR0|You've been in the hospital.  Paint the 
20110109024156.000|20110109024159.000|TR0|picture for us upstairs.  You said there 
20110109024159.000|20110109024201.000|TR0|was one point when this morning, the 
20110109024201.000|20110109024204.000|TR0|national media and local media were 
20110109024204.000|20110109024207.000|TR0|reporting that she had died.  And you were 
20110109024207.000|20110109024210.000|TR0|right there with her and she was still 
20110109024210.000|20110109024212.000|TR0|alive.  But it was so overwhelming you 
20110109024212.000|20110109024215.000|TR0|said that you almost started to not 
20110109024215.000|20110109024218.000|TR0|believe yourselves?
20110109024218.000|20110109024221.000|TR0|
20110109024221.000|20110109024224.000|TR0|STEVE FARLEY, ARIZONA STATE HOUSE:  We 
20110109024224.000|20110109024226.000|TR0|were inside basically a bubble of truth 
20110109024226.000|20110109024229.000|TR0|where everyone on the outside was just 
20110109024229.000|20110109024232.000|TR0|scrambling for anything.  And it was very 
20110109024232.000|20110109024235.000|TR0|disturbing to the family when they start 
20110109024235.000|20110109024237.000|TR0|to hear text messages and voice-mails 
20110109024237.000|20110109024240.000|TR0|coming in saying that she died. And we 
20110109024240.000|20110109024243.000|TR0|know we just talked to the surgeons and 
20110109024243.000|20110109024246.000|TR0|there was not a problem at that point.
20110109024246.000|20110109024249.000|TR0|
20110109024249.000|20110109024251.000|TR0|So, it was a tough situation.  People did 
20110109024251.000|20110109024254.000|TR0|not know what's going on. We did know what 
20110109024254.000|20110109024257.000|TR0|was going on there, because everyone else 
20110109024257.000|20110109024300.000|TR0|is outside didn't know.  It's been tough.
20110109024300.000|20110109024302.000|TR0|
20110109024302.000|20110109024305.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  What can you tell us the latest 
20110109024305.000|20110109024308.000|TR0|you've heard in terms of her condition and 
20110109024308.000|20110109024311.000|TR0|the condition of the others that have been 
20110109024311.000|20110109024314.000|TR0|injured?
20110109024314.000|20110109024316.000|TR0|
20110109024316.000|20110109024319.000|TR0|FARLEY:  Well, in terms of the condition, 
20110109024319.000|20110109024322.000|TR0|I'm not necessarily qualified to say 
20110109024322.000|20110109024325.000|TR0|what's going on there.  But the biggest 
20110109024325.000|20110109024327.000|TR0|issue that I would want people to 
20110109024327.000|20110109024330.000|TR0|understand is that this is not how Arizona 
20110109024330.000|20110109024333.000|TR0|is.
20110109024333.000|20110109024336.000|TR0|
20110109024336.000|20110109024339.000|TR0|I just spoke to a group of people who are 
20110109024339.000|20110109024341.000|TR0|here on vigil and I told them that what 
20110109024341.000|20110109024344.000|TR0|I've been comforting myself with and 
20110109024344.000|20110109024347.000|TR0|others this morning is saying I just -- 
20110109024347.000|20110109024350.000|TR0|came to me and said that you can't stop 
20110109024350.000|20110109024352.000|TR0|hope with a bullet.  You can't stop love 
20110109024352.000|20110109024355.000|TR0|with a bullet.  And Gabby is somebody 
20110109024355.000|20110109024358.000|TR0|filled with such hope and such love for 
20110109024358.000|20110109024401.000|TR0|the future of our country, of our state.
20110109024401.000|20110109024404.000|TR0|
20110109024404.000|20110109024406.000|TR0|The people who are all gathered here 
20110109024406.000|20110109024409.000|TR0|tonight, they're all friends and by 
20110109024409.000|20110109024412.000|TR0|extension, they're family.  We are all 
20110109024412.000|20110109024415.000|TR0|family, that's the kind of person Gabby 
20110109024415.000|20110109024417.000|TR0|is.  We know she is going to pull through. 
20110109024417.000|20110109024420.000|TR0| We just know that.
20110109024420.000|20110109024423.000|TR0|
20110109024423.000|20110109024426.000|TR0|And it's been -- it's been -- the family 
20110109024426.000|20110109024429.000|TR0|in there, the pain has been going through. 
20110109024429.000|20110109024431.000|TR0| We have this great faith and hope that we 
20110109024431.000|20110109024434.000|TR0|can come out of this on the other side as 
20110109024434.000|20110109024437.000|TR0|a changed state.
20110109024437.000|20110109024440.000|TR0|
20110109024440.000|20110109024442.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  She was not the only part of 
20110109024442.000|20110109024445.000|TR0|the team that is in this hospital now.  
20110109024445.000|20110109024448.000|TR0|She lost a member of her team as well, a 
20110109024448.000|20110109024451.000|TR0|young man who was part of the local 
20110109024451.000|20110109024454.000|TR0|outreach program here.  Talk a little bit 
20110109024454.000|20110109024456.000|TR0|about Gabe Zimmerman who did die.
20110109024456.000|20110109024459.000|TR0|
20110109024459.000|20110109024502.000|TR0|FARLEY:  Gabe Zimmerman was a friend of 
20110109024502.000|20110109024505.000|TR0|mine.  He was a friend of so many people 
20110109024505.000|20110109024508.000|TR0|in the Tucson area.  He was so empathetic, 
20110109024508.000|20110109024510.000|TR0|one of the kindest individuals I have ever 
20110109024510.000|20110109024513.000|TR0|met.  He's a brilliant, great strategist, 
20110109024513.000|20110109024516.000|TR0|just always knew what to do and always 
20110109024516.000|20110109024519.000|TR0|there -- such a hard worker and a huge 
20110109024519.000|20110109024521.000|TR0|rising star here in Tucson.
20110109024521.000|20110109024524.000|TR0|
20110109024524.000|20110109024527.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  And his fiance is in the 
20110109024527.000|20110109024530.000|TR0|hospital?
20110109024530.000|20110109024533.000|TR0|
20110109024533.000|20110109024535.000|TR0|FARLEY:  His fiancee is in the hospital.  
20110109024535.000|20110109024538.000|TR0|It is such an absolute senseless tragedy 
20110109024538.000|20110109024541.000|TR0|that somebody that young and somebody that 
20110109024541.000|20110109024544.000|TR0|promising to be cut down in the prime of 
20110109024544.000|20110109024546.000|TR0|his life, it's hard to be even put that in 
20110109024546.000|20110109024549.000|TR0|words.
20110109024549.000|20110109024552.000|TR0|
20110109024552.000|20110109024555.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Your campaign director was at 
20110109024555.000|20110109024558.000|TR0|that scene at the time.  And you say when 
20110109024558.000|20110109024600.000|TR0|he arrived, he was covered in blood and he 
20110109024600.000|20110109024603.000|TR0|actually put pressure on the 
20110109024603.000|20110109024606.000|TR0|congresswoman's head to help stop the 
20110109024606.000|20110109024609.000|TR0|bleeding.  Tell us what he told you and 
20110109024609.000|20110109024611.000|TR0|what you saw.
20110109024611.000|20110109024614.000|TR0|
20110109024614.000|20110109024617.000|TR0|FARLEY:  Daniel is an amazing person, he's 
20110109024617.000|20110109024620.000|TR0|my campaign manager, he's also a trained 
20110109024620.000|20110109024623.000|TR0|nurse.  He was interning for Gabby and 
20110109024623.000|20110109024625.000|TR0|staffing that event.  He said that when he 
20110109024625.000|20110109024628.000|TR0|was in the back of the room, he heard 
20110109024628.000|20110109024631.000|TR0|shots in the front, he rushed to see what 
20110109024631.000|20110109024634.000|TR0|had happened, and saw that Gabby was on 
20110109024634.000|20110109024636.000|TR0|the floor.  He was able to use his nurse 
20110109024636.000|20110109024639.000|TR0|training and snapped right into it and was 
20110109024639.000|20110109024642.000|TR0|able to apply pressure to the wound and 
20110109024642.000|20110109024645.000|TR0|keep her active and alert until the 
20110109024645.000|20110109024648.000|TR0|ambulance came, about 10 minutes he said.  
20110109024648.000|20110109024650.000|TR0|And then he rode with her in the ambulance 
20110109024650.000|20110109024653.000|TR0|to the hospital.
20110109024653.000|20110109024656.000|TR0|
20110109024656.000|20110109024659.000|TR0|And I just really think he's one of the 
20110109024659.000|20110109024701.000|TR0|heroes here, because I think it's possible 
20110109024701.000|20110109024704.000|TR0|that that swift thinking and his training 
20110109024704.000|20110109024707.000|TR0|could have helped to save her life. 
20110109024707.000|20110109024710.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Tell us what it's like up 
20110109024710.000|20110109024713.000|TR0|there.  She's not the only one. There are 
20110109024713.000|20110109024715.000|TR0|other family members and I understand that 
20110109024715.000|20110109024718.000|TR0|they're in separate rooms getting updates. 
20110109024718.000|20110109024721.000|TR0| What is it like right now inside that 
20110109024721.000|20110109024724.000|TR0|hospital?
20110109024724.000|20110109024726.000|TR0|
20110109024726.000|20110109024729.000|TR0|FARLEY:  Well, everyone's very tense.  
20110109024729.000|20110109024732.000|TR0|Some of them know that their loved ones 
20110109024732.000|20110109024735.000|TR0|have passed unfortunately.  And other ones 
20110109024735.000|20110109024738.000|TR0|are waiting and seeing what happens after 
20110109024738.000|20110109024740.000|TR0|surgeries.
20110109024740.000|20110109024743.000|TR0|
20110109024743.000|20110109024746.000|TR0|Right now, everyone's just supporting each 
20110109024746.000|20110109024749.000|TR0|other.  There's a lot of hugging.  There's 
20110109024749.000|20110109024751.000|TR0|a lot of just listening.  A lot of quiet 
20110109024751.000|20110109024754.000|TR0|contemplation and people are coming in who 
20110109024754.000|20110109024757.000|TR0|know the different family members and it 
20110109024757.000|20110109024800.000|TR0|really is important to emphasize that this 
20110109024800.000|20110109024803.000|TR0|isn't just about Gabby, it's about all the 
20110109024803.000|20110109024805.000|TR0|other people who were there at the time 
20110109024805.000|20110109024808.000|TR0|and how much this community can come 
20110109024808.000|20110109024811.000|TR0|together in a time of crisis.
20110109024811.000|20110109024814.000|TR0|
20110109024814.000|20110109024816.000|TR0|We know we do that here in Tucson and we 
20110109024816.000|20110109024819.000|TR0|do that very well.  The question is: can 
20110109024819.000|20110109024822.000|TR0|we come together as a state and can we 
20110109024822.000|20110109024825.000|TR0|come together as a country, and sort of 
20110109024825.000|20110109024828.000|TR0|put this harsh hyper rhetoric that has 
20110109024828.000|20110109024830.000|TR0|caused people who are a little unhinged in 
20110109024830.000|20110109024833.000|TR0|the first place to go over the edge.  Can 
20110109024833.000|20110109024836.000|TR0|we put that sort of rhetoric behind us and 
20110109024836.000|20110109024839.000|TR0|come together and be one country again?
20110109024839.000|20110109024841.000|TR0|
20110109024841.000|20110109024844.000|TR0|And I believe that we can.  I think this 
20110109024844.000|20110109024847.000|TR0|is one of those moments where there's a 
20110109024847.000|20110109024850.000|TR0|before and an after, and the after is what 
20110109024850.000|20110109024853.000|TR0|we have to work together and build 
20110109024853.000|20110109024855.000|TR0|towards.  And I believe that the spirit 
20110109024855.000|20110109024858.000|TR0|here tonight in the vigil, the spirit 
20110109024858.000|20110109024901.000|TR0|there waiting among the family and the 
20110109024901.000|20110109024904.000|TR0|friends knows that we will -- we are 
20110109024904.000|20110109024906.000|TR0|determined to move forward and change the 
20110109024906.000|20110109024909.000|TR0|game now.  This country is something that 
20110109024909.000|20110109024912.000|TR0|deserves no less than the politics that 
20110109024912.000|20110109024915.000|TR0|rises above violence.
20110109024915.000|20110109024918.000|TR0|
20110109024918.000|20110109024920.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Are you expecting more updates 
20110109024920.000|20110109024923.000|TR0|tonight on her condition? Have you been 
20110109024923.000|20110109024926.000|TR0|told what to expect over the next 24, 48 
20110109024926.000|20110109024929.000|TR0|hours?
20110109024929.000|20110109024931.000|TR0|
20110109024931.000|20110109024934.000|TR0|FARLEY:  We have heard that the prognosis 
20110109024934.000|20110109024937.000|TR0|is pretty good, but there's a lot of other 
20110109024937.000|20110109024940.000|TR0|tests to be done and we'll see how she 
20110109024940.000|20110109024943.000|TR0|responds as she comes out of the surgery.  
20110109024943.000|20110109024945.000|TR0|But we're going to be staying and holding 
20110109024945.000|20110109024948.000|TR0|vigil and doing what we can to help the 
20110109024948.000|20110109024951.000|TR0|other people who are there who are 
20110109024951.000|20110109024954.000|TR0|suffering.  This is going to take a lot of 
20110109024954.000|20110109024956.000|TR0|people coming together and help each other 
20110109024956.000|20110109024959.000|TR0|recover from this more.  But I believe 
20110109024959.000|20110109025002.000|TR0|that we can recover from this more 
20110109025002.000|20110109025005.000|TR0|strongly.
20110109025005.000|20110109025008.000|TR0|
20110109025008.000|20110109025010.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  We also believe that her chief 
20110109025010.000|20110109025013.000|TR0|of staff was injured and underwent surgery 
20110109025013.000|20110109025016.000|TR0|and has come out of surgery, is still in 
20110109025016.000|20110109025019.000|TR0|critical. But can you update us?
20110109025019.000|20110109025022.000|TR0|
20110109025022.000|20110109025024.000|TR0|FARLEY:  As far as I know, Ron Barber is 
20110109025024.000|20110109025027.000|TR0|her chief of staff, another incredible 
20110109025027.000|20110109025030.000|TR0|individual that I have known for many 
20110109025030.000|20110109025033.000|TR0|years, is going to have a very good 
20110109025033.000|20110109025035.000|TR0|prognosis.  He's come out of surgery 
20110109025035.000|20110109025038.000|TR0|successfully and it's going to be 
20110109025038.000|20110109025041.000|TR0|difficult but he's going to be coming 
20110109025041.000|20110109025044.000|TR0|back.  And things look pretty good for Ron.
20110109025044.000|20110109025047.000|TR0|
20110109025047.000|20110109025049.000|TR0|Additionally, there's another one of her 
20110109025049.000|20110109025052.000|TR0|staffer that people may know, Pam Simon 
20110109025052.000|20110109025055.000|TR0|who was also was seriously injured.  And 
20110109025055.000|20110109025058.000|TR0|from what I have heard, she's doing fairly 
20110109025058.000|20110109025100.000|TR0|well at this point as well.  So, pass on 
20110109025100.000|20110109025103.000|TR0|to her friends.
20110109025103.000|20110109025106.000|TR0|
20110109025106.000|20110109025109.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:   So, Steve Farley, one of the 
20110109025109.000|20110109025112.000|TR0|many people here, Wolf, at this vigil and 
20110109025112.000|20110109025114.000|TR0|inside the hospital, just waiting word for 
20110109025114.000|20110109025117.000|TR0|all of the victims, not only as he said, 
20110109025117.000|20110109025120.000|TR0|the congresswoman but her staff members 
20110109025120.000|20110109025123.000|TR0|and the other victims that have been 
20110109025123.000|20110109025125.000|TR0|brought here.  Again, 10 total injured, 
20110109025125.000|20110109025128.000|TR0|five in critical condition, five in 
20110109025128.000|20110109025131.000|TR0|serious, those five in critical include 
20110109025131.000|20110109025134.000|TR0|the congresswoman who's in the ICU unit -- 
20110109025134.000|20110109025137.000|TR0|Wolf.
20110109025137.000|20110109025139.000|TR0|
20110109025139.000|20110109025142.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes, eighteen people altogether 
20110109025142.000|20110109025145.000|TR0|shot in this incident, six confirmed dead. 
20110109025145.000|20110109025148.000|TR0| We're watching all of this very closely.
20110109025148.000|20110109025150.000|TR0|
20110109025150.000|20110109025153.000|TR0|Ted, thank you so much.  Don't go too far 
20110109025153.000|20110109025156.000|TR0|away, we're going to check back with you, 
20110109025156.000|20110109025159.000|TR0|we're going to continue our coverage.  
20110109025159.000|20110109025202.000|TR0|We're going to speak with an eyewitness of 
20110109025202.000|20110109025204.000|TR0|what happened right after this.
20110109025204.000|20110109025207.000|TR0|
20110109025207.000|20110109025210.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110109025210.000|20110109025213.000|TR0|
20110109025213.000|20110109025215.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We're continuing our coverage of 
20110109025215.000|20110109025218.000|TR0|the shooting spree in Tucson, Arizona, 18 
20110109025218.000|20110109025221.000|TR0|people shot, six confirmed dead.  The 
20110109025221.000|20110109025224.000|TR0|others, many of them are in very critical 
20110109025224.000|20110109025227.000|TR0|condition, including Congresswoman 
20110109025227.000|20110109025229.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.  She was the initial 
20110109025229.000|20110109025232.000|TR0|target, according to the local sheriff of 
20110109025232.000|20110109025235.000|TR0|this assassination attempt.
20110109025235.000|20110109025238.000|TR0|
20110109025238.000|20110109025240.000|TR0|Joining us now is Joe Zamudio.  He's an 
20110109025240.000|20110109025243.000|TR0|eyewitness.  He was there at the scene.
20110109025243.000|20110109025246.000|TR0|
20110109025246.000|20110109025249.000|TR0|Joe, thanks very much.  Tell us where you 
20110109025249.000|20110109025252.000|TR0|were when you came upon this meet and 
20110109025252.000|20110109025254.000|TR0|greet.  We were told about 20 or 30 people 
20110109025254.000|20110109025257.000|TR0|had come out to meet Congresswoman 
20110109025257.000|20110109025300.000|TR0|Giffords outside this Safeway in Tucson.
20110109025300.000|20110109025303.000|TR0|
20110109025303.000|20110109025305.000|TR0|JOE ZAMUDIO, EYEWITNESS TO TUCSON 
20110109025305.000|20110109025308.000|TR0|SHOOTINGS:  It was just a normal Saturday. 
20110109025308.000|20110109025311.000|TR0| You know, I woke up and I had breakfast 
20110109025311.000|20110109025314.000|TR0|with my mom.  I was planning on watching 
20110109025314.000|20110109025317.000|TR0|football.
20110109025317.000|20110109025319.000|TR0|
20110109025319.000|20110109025322.000|TR0|I didn't plan on this.  It was a horrible 
20110109025322.000|20110109025325.000|TR0|thing.  I walked out and I went into the 
20110109025325.000|20110109025328.000|TR0|Walgreens to buy cigarettes and inside at 
20110109025328.000|20110109025330.000|TR0|the counter, I heard the gunshots.  And it 
20110109025330.000|20110109025333.000|TR0|was like fireworks almost.  It was pop, 
20110109025333.000|20110109025336.000|TR0|pop, pop, real fast.  And then --
20110109025336.000|20110109025339.000|TR0|
20110109025339.000|20110109025342.000|TR0|BLITZER:  What did you do?
20110109025342.000|20110109025344.000|TR0|
20110109025344.000|20110109025347.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  As I said -- I said to the girl 
20110109025347.000|20110109025350.000|TR0|behind the counter, I said, is that -- 
20110109025350.000|20110109025353.000|TR0|because I was going to say, is that 
20110109025353.000|20110109025355.000|TR0|fireworks?  But I knew it was a gun.  I've 
20110109025355.000|20110109025358.000|TR0|been raised around guns all of my life.  
20110109025358.000|20110109025401.000|TR0|And I knew it was gun, and I carry a gun 
20110109025401.000|20110109025404.000|TR0|for my own protection.  And I had it with 
20110109025404.000|20110109025407.000|TR0|me.
20110109025407.000|20110109025409.000|TR0|
20110109025409.000|20110109025412.000|TR0|So, I ran back outside and there was a man 
20110109025412.000|20110109025415.000|TR0|with a camera who said, shooter, shooter, 
20110109025415.000|20110109025418.000|TR0|get down.  And I ran towards the noise and 
20110109025418.000|20110109025420.000|TR0|that was after the last gunshot.  At that 
20110109025420.000|20110109025423.000|TR0|point, another gentleman we spoke with, 
20110109025423.000|20110109025426.000|TR0|another gentleman and a lady were 
20110109025426.000|20110109025429.000|TR0|wrestling with -- I don't know what his 
20110109025429.000|20110109025432.000|TR0|name is, the guy, the shooter.
20110109025432.000|20110109025434.000|TR0|
20110109025434.000|20110109025437.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Jared Lee Loughner is the 
20110109025437.000|20110109025440.000|TR0|suspected shooter in the case.
20110109025440.000|20110109025443.000|TR0|
20110109025443.000|20110109025445.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  Yes. BLITZER:  So, you ran 
20110109025445.000|20110109025448.000|TR0|toward -- you ran toward the suspect?
20110109025448.000|20110109025451.000|TR0|
20110109025451.000|20110109025454.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  I ran towards them.  Yes, and 
20110109025454.000|20110109025457.000|TR0|they had taken the gun from him.  He was 
20110109025457.000|20110109025459.000|TR0|struggling with them.  I went over there, 
20110109025459.000|20110109025502.000|TR0|I'd pinned him down to the ground and 
20110109025502.000|20110109025505.000|TR0|waited with him until the police came.
20110109025505.000|20110109025508.000|TR0|
20110109025508.000|20110109025511.000|TR0|It was just ridiculous.  He had -- the gun 
20110109025511.000|20110109025513.000|TR0|was empty -- when you finish firing a 
20110109025513.000|20110109025516.000|TR0|semiautomatic like that, the top stays 
20110109025516.000|20110109025519.000|TR0|back, it was cocked off.  It was locked 
20110109025519.000|20110109025522.000|TR0|open.  And he was out of bullets but he 
20110109025522.000|20110109025524.000|TR0|had another extended magazine that he was 
20110109025524.000|20110109025527.000|TR0|trying to load into the gun that the woman 
20110109025527.000|20110109025530.000|TR0|was able to wrestle away from him.
20110109025530.000|20110109025533.000|TR0|
20110109025533.000|20110109025536.000|TR0|And he was going to keep shooting.  It was 
20110109025536.000|20110109025538.000|TR0|not over.  He was -- he just ran out of 
20110109025538.000|20110109025541.000|TR0|bullets.
20110109025541.000|20110109025544.000|TR0|
20110109025544.000|20110109025547.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So, how long did you -- how long 
20110109025547.000|20110109025549.000|TR0|were you on him holding him down?
20110109025549.000|20110109025552.000|TR0|
20110109025552.000|20110109025555.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  Oh, I don't know, not more than 
20110109025555.000|20110109025558.000|TR0|five minutes.  Probably about like three 
20110109025558.000|20110109025601.000|TR0|or four.  It seemed like a really long 
20110109025601.000|20110109025603.000|TR0|time at first. But I checked my phone 
20110109025603.000|20110109025606.000|TR0|afterwards because I was calling 911.  And 
20110109025606.000|20110109025609.000|TR0|it couldn't have been more than five 
20110109025609.000|20110109025612.000|TR0|minutes, three minutes, four minutes maybe.
20110109025612.000|20110109025614.000|TR0|
20110109025614.000|20110109025617.000|TR0|The first sheriff's department officer 
20110109025617.000|20110109025620.000|TR0|showed up.  And when he got there, we 
20110109025620.000|20110109025623.000|TR0|said, we've got him, he's right here, 
20110109025623.000|20110109025626.000|TR0|here's the shooter. He came and put him in 
20110109025626.000|20110109025628.000|TR0|cuffs.
20110109025628.000|20110109025631.000|TR0|
20110109025631.000|20110109025634.000|TR0|Almost immediately, there was two or three 
20110109025634.000|20110109025637.000|TR0|more deputies there.  They searched him in 
20110109025637.000|20110109025639.000|TR0|my presence.  I saw them pulled two more 
20110109025639.000|20110109025642.000|TR0|magazines out of his pocket and a pocket 
20110109025642.000|20110109025645.000|TR0|knife.  I mean, he was ready for war.  He 
20110109025645.000|20110109025648.000|TR0|wasn't playing around.  And --
20110109025648.000|20110109025651.000|TR0|
20110109025651.000|20110109025653.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Did he say anything during these 
20110109025653.000|20110109025656.000|TR0|five minutes --
20110109025656.000|20110109025659.000|TR0|
20110109025659.000|20110109025702.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  The only thing -- the only thing 
20110109025702.000|20110109025704.000|TR0|he said was, my arm, ow, my arm.  They had 
20110109025704.000|20110109025707.000|TR0|his arm wrenched back, which I'm really 
20110109025707.000|20110109025710.000|TR0|glad.  I didn't know he had a knife in his 
20110109025710.000|20110109025713.000|TR0|pocket.  I mean, I had a gun and if he had 
20110109025713.000|20110109025716.000|TR0|been reloaded or something, I would have 
20110109025716.000|20110109025718.000|TR0|pulled it on him.
20110109025718.000|20110109025721.000|TR0|
20110109025721.000|20110109025724.000|TR0|But I wasn't -- I wasn't trying to go that 
20110109025724.000|20110109025727.000|TR0|place and scare anyone if it wasn't 
20110109025727.000|20110109025729.000|TR0|necessary.  But I didn't know he had a 
20110109025729.000|20110109025732.000|TR0|knife on him.  He could have hurt us there 
20110109025732.000|20110109025735.000|TR0|holding him down.  It was just scary.
20110109025735.000|20110109025738.000|TR0|
20110109025738.000|20110109025741.000|TR0|And, you know, he said, ow, my heart -- I 
20110109025741.000|20110109025743.000|TR0|didn't care, we just kept holding him 
20110109025743.000|20110109025746.000|TR0|there.  His basically expressionless, it 
20110109025746.000|20110109025749.000|TR0|was blank, he was callus almost.
20110109025749.000|20110109025752.000|TR0|
20110109025752.000|20110109025754.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Did you get a chance to see some 
20110109025754.000|20110109025757.000|TR0|of the wounded?  And some of the
20110109025757.000|20110109025800.000|TR0|
20110109025800.000|20110109025803.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  They were everywhere.
20110109025803.000|20110109025806.000|TR0|
20110109025806.000|20110109025808.000|TR0|BLITZER:  They were very close, I take it.
20110109025808.000|20110109025811.000|TR0|
20110109025811.000|20110109025814.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  They were -- it was right there. 
20110109025814.000|20110109025817.000|TR0| I mean, between the entrance to that 
20110109025817.000|20110109025819.000|TR0|Walgreens and that Safeway isn't more than 
20110109025819.000|20110109025822.000|TR0|50 feet or so.  And between there was the 
20110109025822.000|20110109025825.000|TR0|whole thing set up and then he started 
20110109025825.000|20110109025828.000|TR0|near the Safeway.  But he ended up where 
20110109025828.000|20110109025831.000|TR0|they caught him was closer to the 
20110109025831.000|20110109025833.000|TR0|Walgreens.  And that's where we pinned him 
20110109025833.000|20110109025836.000|TR0|down, right there.
20110109025836.000|20110109025839.000|TR0|
20110109025839.000|20110109025842.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Did you see the -- did you see 
20110109025842.000|20110109025844.000|TR0|the Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords?
20110109025844.000|20110109025847.000|TR0|
20110109025847.000|20110109025850.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  From a distance.  Her head was 
20110109025850.000|20110109025853.000|TR0|covered.  Like they said, they were, I 
20110109025853.000|20110109025856.000|TR0|think, trying to stop the bleeding, I'm 
20110109025856.000|20110109025858.000|TR0|not sure.  But she -- there was a lot of 
20110109025858.000|20110109025901.000|TR0|people bleeding and the people crying.  I 
20110109025901.000|20110109025904.000|TR0|saw -- I saw too much bleeding.  I saw 
20110109025904.000|20110109025907.000|TR0|people I know were dead.
20110109025907.000|20110109025909.000|TR0|
20110109025909.000|20110109025912.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Joe --
20110109025912.000|20110109025915.000|TR0|
20110109025915.000|20110109025918.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  It was horrible.
20110109025918.000|20110109025921.000|TR0|
20110109025921.000|20110109025923.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Joe, if you can, I want you to 
20110109025923.000|20110109025926.000|TR0|stay with us because we have more
