20110128220007.000|20110128220009.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, HOST:  Thanks very much.
20110128220009.000|20110128220011.000|TR0|
20110128220011.000|20110128220014.000|TR0|Happening now, breaking news -- the unrest 
20110128220014.000|20110128220016.000|TR0|in Egypt exploding in violence.  Police 
20110128220016.000|20110128220018.000|TR0|and protesters clashing in a haze of tear 
20110128220018.000|20110128220021.000|TR0|gas and flames.  The future of this 
20110128220021.000|20110128220023.000|TR0|critical U.S. ally very uncertain right 
20110128220023.000|20110128220025.000|TR0|now.  We're bringing you these historic 
20110128220025.000|20110128220028.000|TR0|developments -- the revolt live and 
20110128220028.000|20110128220030.000|TR0|global, as only CNN can.
20110128220030.000|20110128220032.000|TR0|
20110128220032.000|20110128220035.000|TR0|President Obama is keeping a very close 
20110128220035.000|20110128220037.000|TR0|watch on the situation in Egypt.  
20110128220037.000|20110128220039.000|TR0|Administration officials are choosing 
20110128220039.000|20110128220042.000|TR0|their words very carefully.  A lot of 
20110128220042.000|20110128220044.000|TR0|questions about how much pressure they're 
20110128220044.000|20110128220046.000|TR0|willing to put on Egypt's embattled 
20110128220046.000|20110128220049.000|TR0|President Mubarak.
20110128220049.000|20110128220051.000|TR0|
20110128220051.000|20110128220053.000|TR0|Americans have an enormous stake in what's 
20110128220053.000|20110128220056.000|TR0|happening in the Middle East right now.  
20110128220056.000|20110128220058.000|TR0|We're taking a much closer look at just 
20110128220058.000|20110128220100.000|TR0|how much the U.S. has invested in Egypt's 
20110128220100.000|20110128220103.000|TR0|government, in Egypt's military.
20110128220103.000|20110128220105.000|TR0|
20110128220105.000|20110128220107.000|TR0|We want to welcome our viewers in the 
20110128220107.000|20110128220110.000|TR0|United States and around the world.
20110128220110.000|20110128220112.000|TR0|
20110128220112.000|20110128220114.000|TR0|I'm Wolf Blitzer.  You're in THE SITUATION 
20110128220114.000|20110128220117.000|TR0|ROOM.
20110128220117.000|20110128220119.000|TR0|
20110128220119.000|20110128220121.000|TR0|ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN breaking news.
20110128220121.000|20110128220124.000|TR0|
20110128220124.000|20110128220126.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  It's just after 
20110128220126.000|20110128220128.000|TR0|midnight in Egypt right now, where a 
20110128220128.000|20110128220131.000|TR0|pillar of power in the Middle East could 
20110128220131.000|20110128220133.000|TR0|be on the brink of collapse.  The uprising 
20110128220133.000|20110128220135.000|TR0|against President Hosni Mubarak reaching 
20110128220135.000|20110128220138.000|TR0|new levels of intensity and violence over 
20110128220138.000|20110128220140.000|TR0|the past few hours.  We're following this 
20110128220140.000|20110128220142.000|TR0|breaking story playing out across Egypt.
20110128220142.000|20110128220145.000|TR0|
20110128220145.000|20110128220147.000|TR0|Thousands and thousands of demonstrators 
20110128220147.000|20110128220149.000|TR0|poured into the streets of major cities 
20110128220149.000|20110128220152.000|TR0|across the country.  They were met by 
20110128220152.000|20110128220154.000|TR0|armored vehicles and riot police firing 
20110128220154.000|20110128220156.000|TR0|tear gas, water cannon and even guns.  The 
20110128220156.000|20110128220159.000|TR0|headquarters of Egypt's ruling party was 
20110128220159.000|20110128220201.000|TR0|burned, reportedly by demonstrators.  We 
20110128220201.000|20110128220203.000|TR0|have not seen President Mubarak all day.  
20110128220203.000|20110128220206.000|TR0|Repeat -- we have not seen President 
20110128220206.000|20110128220208.000|TR0|Mubarak all day..  And just a short while 
20110128220208.000|20110128220210.000|TR0|ago, the White House said President Obama 
20110128220210.000|20110128220213.000|TR0|has not spoken with the Egyptian 
20110128220213.000|20110128220215.000|TR0|president, either.
20110128220215.000|20110128220217.000|TR0|
20110128220217.000|20110128220220.000|TR0|Let's go to CNN's Fred Pleitgen.
20110128220220.000|20110128220222.000|TR0|
20110128220222.000|20110128220224.000|TR0|He's on the scene for us in Cairo, 
20110128220224.000|20110128220227.000|TR0|watching all of these historic 
20110128220227.000|20110128220229.000|TR0|developments unfold -- Fred, first of all, 
20110128220229.000|20110128220231.000|TR0|give our viewers the very latest.
20110128220231.000|20110128220234.000|TR0|
20110128220234.000|20110128220236.000|TR0|It's just after midnight in Cairo.
20110128220236.000|20110128220238.000|TR0|
20110128220238.000|20110128220241.000|TR0|What's going on?
20110128220241.000|20110128220243.000|TR0|
20110128220243.000|20110128220245.000|TR0|FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL 
20110128220245.000|20110128220248.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, there still are a 
20110128220248.000|20110128220250.000|TR0|lot of people on the streets, Wolf, here 
20110128220250.000|20110128220253.000|TR0|in Cairo. They're still chanting, as you 
20110128220253.000|20110128220255.000|TR0|-- as you said.  The headquarters of the 
20110128220255.000|20110128220257.000|TR0|ruling party was burned by protesters.  It 
20110128220257.000|20110128220300.000|TR0|was also looted.  We've been seeing cars 
20110128220300.000|20110128220302.000|TR0|driving around in the streets with all 
20110128220302.000|20110128220304.000|TR0|sorts of office chairs on them.
20110128220304.000|20110128220307.000|TR0|
20110128220307.000|20110128220309.000|TR0|There was massive rioting here throughout 
20110128220309.000|20110128220311.000|TR0|the day, the police using tear gas, 
20110128220311.000|20110128220314.000|TR0|demonstrators telling us that they were 
20110128220314.000|20110128220316.000|TR0|also live firing at some of the stages.  
20110128220316.000|20110128220318.000|TR0|They were showing us empty shell casings.
20110128220318.000|20110128220321.000|TR0|
20110128220321.000|20110128220323.000|TR0|We were actually in some of the protests, 
20110128220323.000|20110128220325.000|TR0|where the police appeared to be firing 
20110128220325.000|20110128220328.000|TR0|live rounds our way and the demonstrators' 
20110128220328.000|20110128220330.000|TR0|way. And we also got into a lot of melee.  
20110128220330.000|20110128220332.000|TR0|We were caught in tear gas exchanges.
20110128220332.000|20110128220335.000|TR0|
20110128220335.000|20110128220337.000|TR0|So certainly, it's been a very, very busy 
20110128220337.000|20110128220339.000|TR0|-- a very violent day here on the streets 
20110128220339.000|20110128220342.000|TR0|of Cairo.  But I can tell you one thing.  
20110128220342.000|20110128220344.000|TR0|The people, they were always telling me 
20110128220344.000|20110128220346.000|TR0|they're not going to give up, they're not 
20110128220346.000|20110128220349.000|TR0|going to let up.  And there were -- there 
20110128220349.000|20110128220351.000|TR0|were also stages of the game when they 
20110128220351.000|20110128220353.000|TR0|were beating back the -- the police forces.
20110128220353.000|20110128220356.000|TR0|
20110128220356.000|20110128220358.000|TR0|And now that it's nighttime, the police 
20110128220358.000|20110128220400.000|TR0|have absolutely disappeared off the 
20110128220400.000|20110128220403.000|TR0|streets of Cairo.  The army has taken its 
20110128220403.000|20110128220405.000|TR0|place. The army is here.  The army is 
20110128220405.000|20110128220407.000|TR0|shielding key government institutions 
20110128220407.000|20110128220410.000|TR0|like, for instance, the information 
20110128220410.000|20110128220412.000|TR0|ministry, which is right next to our 
20110128220412.000|20110128220414.000|TR0|office; of course, not shielding the party 
20110128220414.000|20110128220417.000|TR0|headquarters of President Mubarak.
20110128220417.000|20110128220419.000|TR0|
20110128220419.000|20110128220421.000|TR0|And there are many people here in this 
20110128220421.000|20110128220424.000|TR0|country who question whether Hosni Mubarak 
20110128220424.000|20110128220426.000|TR0|will, indeed, be the president of this 
20110128220426.000|20110128220428.000|TR0|country before dawn tomorrow -- Wolf.
20110128220428.000|20110128220431.000|TR0|
20110128220431.000|20110128220433.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Because there's a lot of rumors 
20110128220433.000|20110128220435.000|TR0|flying around Egypt, here in Washington, 
20110128220435.000|20110128220438.000|TR0|as you know, Fred, that the -- the 
20110128220438.000|20110128220440.000|TR0|Egyptian president's wife is already 
20110128220440.000|20110128220442.000|TR0|outside of Egypt, maybe in London; his 
20110128220442.000|20110128220445.000|TR0|son, Gamal, who is the heir apparent, he's 
20110128220445.000|20110128220447.000|TR0|already outside of Egypt. And we don't 
20110128220447.000|20110128220449.000|TR0|know what's -- what the status is of the 
20110128220449.000|20110128220452.000|TR0|Egyptian president, Mubarak.
20110128220452.000|20110128220454.000|TR0|
20110128220454.000|20110128220456.000|TR0|But there has been a statement on Egyptian 
20110128220456.000|20110128220459.000|TR0|television saying get ready for, quote, "a 
20110128220459.000|20110128220501.000|TR0|major announcement."
20110128220501.000|20110128220503.000|TR0|
20110128220503.000|20110128220506.000|TR0|Do we have any more information on that?
20110128220506.000|20110128220508.000|TR0|
20110128220508.000|20110128220510.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Yes.  Yes.  We're -- we're 
20110128220510.000|20110128220513.000|TR0|getting that from Egyptian television, as 
20110128220513.000|20110128220515.000|TR0|well; also from other Egyptian TV or 
20110128220515.000|20110128220517.000|TR0|etcetera, saying that there is going to be 
20110128220517.000|20110128220520.000|TR0|a major announcement by the speaker of 
20110128220520.000|20110128220522.000|TR0|parliament of this country.
20110128220522.000|20110128220524.000|TR0|
20110128220524.000|20110128220527.000|TR0|And now one of the things that we have to 
20110128220527.000|20110128220529.000|TR0|note is that if the president were to step 
20110128220529.000|20110128220531.000|TR0|down, the speaker of parliament would, in 
20110128220531.000|20110128220534.000|TR0|fact, assume powers.
20110128220534.000|20110128220536.000|TR0|
20110128220536.000|20110128220539.000|TR0|So right now we're still waiting on that 
20110128220539.000|20110128220541.000|TR0|statement.  The national TV network is 
20110128220541.000|20110128220543.000|TR0|saying that it's going to come.  We're not 
20110128220543.000|20110128220546.000|TR0|exactly sure when that is going to be the 
20110128220546.000|20110128220548.000|TR0|case.  They keep saying it's soon, it's 
20110128220548.000|20110128220550.000|TR0|soon.  But they're not saying when that's 
20110128220550.000|20110128220553.000|TR0|going to be.  And you said one interesting 
20110128220553.000|20110128220555.000|TR0|thing before, the people here have not 
20110128220555.000|20110128220557.000|TR0|heard from Hosni Mubarak all day 
20110128220557.000|20110128220600.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) with the protesters.  And the 
20110128220600.000|20110128220602.000|TR0|thing that they keep asking here is, what 
20110128220602.000|20110128220604.000|TR0|did Mubarak say?
20110128220604.000|20110128220607.000|TR0|
20110128220607.000|20110128220609.000|TR0|What did Mubarak say?
20110128220609.000|20110128220611.000|TR0|
20110128220611.000|20110128220614.000|TR0|And I keep telling them, I don't know.  He 
20110128220614.000|20110128220616.000|TR0|hasn't said anything yet.  And I think 
20110128220616.000|20110128220618.000|TR0|it's something that's really unprecedented 
20110128220618.000|20110128220621.000|TR0|here for this country, where there seems 
20110128220621.000|20110128220623.000|TR0|to be a complete meltdown within the 
20110128220623.000|20110128220625.000|TR0|government here in this country, which is 
20110128220625.000|20110128220628.000|TR0|so strong and so repressive on the people 
20110128220628.000|20110128220630.000|TR0|here, that it's really something where 
20110128220630.000|20110128220632.000|TR0|they found a new freedom.
20110128220632.000|20110128220635.000|TR0|
20110128220635.000|20110128220637.000|TR0|And this is something that's really 
20110128220637.000|20110128220639.000|TR0|emboldened the protesters, as well, where 
20110128220639.000|20110128220642.000|TR0|they have seen that the -- the security 
20110128220642.000|20110128220644.000|TR0|forces are not invisible.  The president 
20110128220644.000|20110128220646.000|TR0|is absolutely silent.  This is really 
20110128220646.000|20110128220649.000|TR0|making the protesters who are on the 
20110128220649.000|20110128220651.000|TR0|streets here feel even stronger and more 
20110128220651.000|20110128220653.000|TR0|resilient -- Wolf.
20110128220653.000|20110128220656.000|TR0|
20110128220656.000|20110128220658.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Fred, I want you to stand by and 
20110128220658.000|20110128220700.000|TR0|listen to this, because joining us on the 
20110128220700.000|20110128220703.000|TR0|phone right now -- he's one of our CNN 
20110128220703.000|20110128220705.000|TR0|iReporters who witnessed the clashes 
20110128220705.000|20110128220707.000|TR0|firsthand just outside his hotel balcony 
20110128220707.000|20110128220710.000|TR0|in Cairo.  We're talking to Kristian on 
20110128220710.000|20110128220712.000|TR0|the phone.  And for safety purposes, we're 
20110128220712.000|20110128220714.000|TR0|only going to use his first name.
20110128220714.000|20110128220717.000|TR0|
20110128220717.000|20110128220719.000|TR0|Kristian, tell our viewers here in the 
20110128220719.000|20110128220721.000|TR0|United States and around the world what 
20110128220721.000|20110128220724.000|TR0|you eyewitnessed today.
20110128220724.000|20110128220726.000|TR0|
20110128220726.000|20110128220728.000|TR0|And you're just a regular tourist there.
20110128220728.000|20110128220731.000|TR0|
20110128220731.000|20110128220733.000|TR0|KRISTIAN, WITNESS TO EGYPT REVOLT (via 
20110128220733.000|20110128220735.000|TR0|telephone):  OK.  Yes.  I was watching 
20110128220735.000|20110128220738.000|TR0|from the hotel balcony the -- the scenes 
20110128220738.000|20110128220740.000|TR0|just outside the hotel, which is on the 
20110128220740.000|20110128220742.000|TR0|Nile.  And, yes, at -- at around about 
20110128220742.000|20110128220745.000|TR0|2:00 there was -- during the morning there 
20110128220745.000|20110128220747.000|TR0|was a lot of police that had built up -- 
20110128220747.000|20110128220749.000|TR0|riot police -- on the bridge and the 
20110128220749.000|20110128220752.000|TR0|surrounding square. And there was no 
20110128220752.000|20110128220754.000|TR0|protesters until after prayer.
20110128220754.000|20110128220756.000|TR0|
20110128220756.000|20110128220759.000|TR0|And then at -- at some point before 2:00, 
20110128220759.000|20110128220801.000|TR0|one could hear chants from -- from a 
20110128220801.000|20110128220803.000|TR0|distance -- "Allah Akbar!" "God is Great!" 
20110128220803.000|20110128220806.000|TR0|And it starts to get louder and louder.  
20110128220806.000|20110128220808.000|TR0|And then suddenly, behind a really tall 
20110128220808.000|20110128220810.000|TR0|building, I see like a huge crowd of 
20110128220810.000|20110128220813.000|TR0|demonstrators.  And you just -- you know, 
20110128220813.000|20110128220815.000|TR0|you don't see the end of the line.  It's 
20110128220815.000|20110128220818.000|TR0|just -- it's just so many demonstrators -- 
20110128220818.000|20110128220820.000|TR0|thousands of them.  And there's about 300 
20110128220820.000|20110128220822.000|TR0|or 400 riot police guarding the entrance 
20110128220822.000|20110128220825.000|TR0|to -- on the bridge, watching them all.
20110128220825.000|20110128220827.000|TR0|
20110128220827.000|20110128220829.000|TR0|So, yes.  And then they -- yes, they -- 
20110128220829.000|20110128220832.000|TR0|they met each other then and the 
20110128220832.000|20110128220834.000|TR0|demonstrators were just -- the -- they 
20110128220834.000|20110128220836.000|TR0|went up to the riot police.  And they -- 
20110128220836.000|20110128220839.000|TR0|yes, they were just -- they were -- they 
20110128220839.000|20110128220841.000|TR0|were shouting things at the police and the 
20110128220841.000|20110128220843.000|TR0|police were shouting back.  And, yes.  
20110128220843.000|20110128220846.000|TR0|Then it started with tear gas and the 
20110128220846.000|20110128220848.000|TR0|police hitting the protesters and so on.
20110128220848.000|20110128220850.000|TR0|
20110128220850.000|20110128220853.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And you were close enough to -- 
20110128220853.000|20110128220855.000|TR0|to be affected by that tear gas that was 
20110128220855.000|20110128220857.000|TR0|shot, isn't that right?
20110128220857.000|20110128220900.000|TR0|
20110128220900.000|20110128220902.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  Yes, that -- that was correct.  
20110128220902.000|20110128220904.000|TR0|Well, the tear gas went into the crowds.  
20110128220904.000|20110128220907.000|TR0|So they -- they shot a lot of tear gas, 
20110128220907.000|20110128220909.000|TR0|actually.  So that the -- the crowds went 
20110128220909.000|20110128220911.000|TR0|back, like up to 100 meters back.  And 
20110128220911.000|20110128220914.000|TR0|they still started shooting a lot of tear 
20110128220914.000|20110128220916.000|TR0|gas, even when there were not protesters 
20110128220916.000|20110128220918.000|TR0|near the police.
20110128220918.000|20110128220921.000|TR0|
20110128220921.000|20110128220923.000|TR0|Just the amount of tear gas that they shot 
20110128220923.000|20110128220925.000|TR0|went up into the air and it blew up to the 
20110128220925.000|20110128220928.000|TR0|hotel.  So I -- I got it from my window..  
20110128220928.000|20110128220930.000|TR0|So if the window was open, you got the 
20110128220930.000|20110128220932.000|TR0|tear gas into the room.  And it was very 
20110128220932.000|20110128220935.000|TR0|strong stuff.
20110128220935.000|20110128220937.000|TR0|
20110128220937.000|20110128220939.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And you saw one demonstrator 
20110128220939.000|20110128220942.000|TR0|being taken away by an ambulance.
20110128220942.000|20110128220944.000|TR0|
20110128220944.000|20110128220946.000|TR0|What happened?
20110128220946.000|20110128220949.000|TR0|
20110128220949.000|20110128220951.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  Yes.  I'm not sure if it was an 
20110128220951.000|20110128220953.000|TR0|ambulance or if it was just a civilian 
20110128220953.000|20110128220956.000|TR0|van.  But, yes, I saw a few people helping 
20110128220956.000|20110128220958.000|TR0|-- helping this person who looked 
20110128220958.000|20110128221000.000|TR0|unconscious or injured of some sort and 
20110128221000.000|20110128221003.000|TR0|putting him into a van, and, yes, taking 
20110128221003.000|20110128221005.000|TR0|him away.
20110128221005.000|20110128221007.000|TR0|
20110128221007.000|20110128221010.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Now, Kristian, do you --
20110128221010.000|20110128221012.000|TR0|
20110128221012.000|20110128221014.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  (INAUDIBLE).
20110128221014.000|20110128221017.000|TR0|
20110128221017.000|20110128221019.000|TR0|BLITZER: -- are you trying to get out of 
20110128221019.000|20110128221021.000|TR0|Egypt right now?
20110128221021.000|20110128221024.000|TR0|
20110128221024.000|20110128221026.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  Well, (INAUDIBLE) --
20110128221026.000|20110128221028.000|TR0|
20110128221028.000|20110128221031.000|TR0|BLITZER:  What are the opportunities to 
20110128221031.000|20110128221033.000|TR0|get to the airport and get on a flight?
20110128221033.000|20110128221035.000|TR0|
20110128221035.000|20110128221038.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  At the moment, I'm not sure 
20110128221038.000|20110128221040.000|TR0|what the situation is in terms of travel.  
20110128221040.000|20110128221042.000|TR0|But I've heard reports that the airport, 
20110128221042.000|20110128221045.000|TR0|some flights have been cancelled, quite a 
20110128221045.000|20110128221047.000|TR0|lot of flights.  So I don't know. It's 
20110128221047.000|20110128221049.000|TR0|quite hard to get information, actually, 
20110128221049.000|20110128221052.000|TR0|because, you know, the mobile network is 
20110128221052.000|20110128221054.000|TR0|not working.  The mobile networks are shut 
20110128221054.000|20110128221056.000|TR0|off.  And the Internet is -- is very slow. 
20110128221056.000|20110128221059.000|TR0| I have Internet access, but it's -- it's 
20110128221059.000|20110128221101.000|TR0|not so fast.  And most people don't have 
20110128221101.000|20110128221104.000|TR0|Internet access.  And it's quite hard to 
20110128221104.000|20110128221106.000|TR0|get in contact with -- with different 
20110128221106.000|20110128221108.000|TR0|persons.
20110128221108.000|20110128221111.000|TR0|
20110128221111.000|20110128221113.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So are you going to stay, at 
20110128221113.000|20110128221115.000|TR0|least for now, in Cairo?
20110128221115.000|20110128221118.000|TR0|
20110128221118.000|20110128221120.000|TR0|Do you feel safe?
20110128221120.000|20110128221122.000|TR0|
20110128221122.000|20110128221125.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  Well, I --
20110128221125.000|20110128221127.000|TR0|
20110128221127.000|20110128221129.000|TR0|BLITZER:  How do you feel about that?
20110128221129.000|20110128221132.000|TR0|
20110128221132.000|20110128221134.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  I feel safe, yes.  I think I -- 
20110128221134.000|20110128221136.000|TR0|I -- I feel already -- I feel for the 
20110128221136.000|20110128221139.000|TR0|people on the streets and the Egyptians, 
20110128221139.000|20110128221141.000|TR0|because they are the ones who are having 
20110128221141.000|20110128221143.000|TR0|the -- hard time.  I mean I'm -- I'm a 
20110128221143.000|20110128221146.000|TR0|foreigner.  I'm a tourist.  So I'm, you 
20110128221146.000|20110128221148.000|TR0|know, I feel safe in the -- in the hotel.  
20110128221148.000|20110128221150.000|TR0|It's just not a problem for me.
20110128221150.000|20110128221153.000|TR0|
20110128221153.000|20110128221155.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So you're going to stay, at 
20110128221155.000|20110128221157.000|TR0|least for now, and you're not going to try 
20110128221157.000|20110128221200.000|TR0|to just scramble, get over to the airport 
20110128221200.000|20110128221202.000|TR0|and get on any flight that -- that might 
20110128221202.000|20110128221204.000|TR0|be leaving Egypt, is that what I'm hearing 
20110128221204.000|20110128221207.000|TR0|from you, Kristian?
20110128221207.000|20110128221209.000|TR0|
20110128221209.000|20110128221211.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  Yes.  I will sit tight for the 
20110128221211.000|20110128221214.000|TR0|-- for the next while. But I will look at 
20110128221214.000|20110128221216.000|TR0|the opportunity to -- to fly out, of 
20110128221216.000|20110128221218.000|TR0|course.  And I'll see -- see what's 
20110128221218.000|20110128221221.000|TR0|happening.  I'll watch the situation as it 
20110128221221.000|20110128221223.000|TR0|comes, yes.
20110128221223.000|20110128221225.000|TR0|
20110128221225.000|20110128221228.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is Fred Pleitgen still with us?
20110128221228.000|20110128221230.000|TR0|
20110128221230.000|20110128221232.000|TR0|Fred is our reporter on the scene -- Fred, 
20110128221232.000|20110128221235.000|TR0|are you there?
20110128221235.000|20110128221237.000|TR0|
20110128221237.000|20110128221239.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Yes, I'm still here, Wolf, and 
20110128221239.000|20110128221242.000|TR0|--
20110128221242.000|20110128221244.000|TR0|
20110128221244.000|20110128221246.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, Fred --
20110128221246.000|20110128221249.000|TR0|
20110128221249.000|20110128221251.000|TR0|PLEITGEN: -- it was interesting to hear 
20110128221251.000|20110128221253.000|TR0|what --
20110128221253.000|20110128221256.000|TR0|
20110128221256.000|20110128221258.000|TR0|BLITZER: -- I don't --
20110128221258.000|20110128221300.000|TR0|
20110128221300.000|20110128221303.000|TR0|PLEITGEN: -- what --
20110128221303.000|20110128221305.000|TR0|
20110128221305.000|20110128221307.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I don't know if you want to ask 
20110128221307.000|20110128221310.000|TR0|--
20110128221310.000|20110128221312.000|TR0|
20110128221312.000|20110128221314.000|TR0|PLEITGEN: -- what Kristian was saying 
20110128221314.000|20110128221317.000|TR0|because I've (INAUDIBLE) very little of --
20110128221317.000|20110128221319.000|TR0|
20110128221319.000|20110128221321.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I don't know if you want to ask 
20110128221321.000|20110128221324.000|TR0|Kristian a question. But go ahead and ask 
20110128221324.000|20110128221326.000|TR0|Kristian a question, if you have a 
20110128221326.000|20110128221328.000|TR0|question for him.
20110128221328.000|20110128221331.000|TR0|
20110128221331.000|20110128221333.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Well, I thought it -- I thought 
20110128221333.000|20110128221335.000|TR0|it was very interesting what he had to 
20110128221335.000|20110128221338.000|TR0|say, because one of the things obviously, 
20110128221338.000|20110128221340.000|TR0|that he's been experiencing that we've 
20110128221340.000|20110128221343.000|TR0|been experiencing, as well, is the fact 
20110128221343.000|20110128221345.000|TR0|that there's no Internet here right now.  
20110128221345.000|20110128221347.000|TR0|There's no cell phone service right now.  
20110128221347.000|20110128221350.000|TR0|And you can see how the government has 
20110128221350.000|20110128221352.000|TR0|been trying to stop people from 
20110128221352.000|20110128221354.000|TR0|communicating.
20110128221354.000|20110128221357.000|TR0|
20110128221357.000|20110128221359.000|TR0|The question that I have for Kristian is 
20110128221359.000|20110128221401.000|TR0|that we've been hearing that -- that 
20110128221401.000|20110128221404.000|TR0|tourists here in Egypt have been held up 
20110128221404.000|20110128221406.000|TR0|by security forces and security forces 
20110128221406.000|20110128221408.000|TR0|have been trying to take cameras away from 
20110128221408.000|20110128221411.000|TR0|tourists, as well, to try and stop people 
20110128221411.000|20110128221413.000|TR0|from taking pictures and getting, really, 
20110128221413.000|20110128221415.000|TR0|what's going on here out to the wider 
20110128221415.000|20110128221418.000|TR0|public, because, you know, our own Ben 
20110128221418.000|20110128221420.000|TR0|Wedeman had his camera taken away today 
20110128221420.000|20110128221422.000|TR0|and broken by Egyptian security forces.  
20110128221422.000|20110128221425.000|TR0|They tried to stop us from filming.  They 
20110128221425.000|20110128221427.000|TR0|-- they -- they used tear gas on a lot of 
20110128221427.000|20110128221429.000|TR0|television crews.
20110128221429.000|20110128221432.000|TR0|
20110128221432.000|20110128221434.000|TR0|Has Kristian had any -- any similar thing 
20110128221434.000|20110128221436.000|TR0|happen to him, where security forces have 
20110128221436.000|20110128221439.000|TR0|harassed him or anything like that?
20110128221439.000|20110128221441.000|TR0|
20110128221441.000|20110128221443.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Go ahead, Kristian.     
20110128221443.000|20110128221446.000|TR0|KRISTIAN:  Well, I arrived to the hotel 
20110128221446.000|20110128221448.000|TR0|last night.  And I saw the buildup of a 
20110128221448.000|20110128221450.000|TR0|lot of trucks, police trucks.  And when I 
20110128221450.000|20110128221453.000|TR0|-- when I checked into the hotel, at that 
20110128221453.000|20110128221455.000|TR0|time, they weren't confiscating cameras or 
20110128221455.000|20110128221457.000|TR0|anything like that.  It was just security 
20110128221457.000|20110128221500.000|TR0|checks.  So I stayed in the hotel the 
20110128221500.000|20110128221502.000|TR0|whole time, pretty much.  So I haven't -- 
20110128221502.000|20110128221504.000|TR0|I haven't left the hotel.  And I haven't 
20110128221504.000|20110128221507.000|TR0|left the hotel with any of my -- my stuff. 
20110128221507.000|20110128221509.000|TR0| So I mean maybe they were doing that 
20110128221509.000|20110128221511.000|TR0|today, but I haven't experienced it.  So, 
20110128221511.000|20110128221514.000|TR0|no.
20110128221514.000|20110128221516.000|TR0|
20110128221516.000|20110128221518.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, Kristian, here's a 
20110128221518.000|20110128221521.000|TR0|little piece of advice.
20110128221521.000|20110128221523.000|TR0|
20110128221523.000|20110128221525.000|TR0|Don't leave the hotel, at least for now.  
20110128221525.000|20110128221528.000|TR0|Stay put.  I'm sure you'll be fine, as 
20110128221528.000|20110128221530.000|TR0|long as you're in there.  We'll stay in 
20110128221530.000|20110128221532.000|TR0|close touch with you.
20110128221532.000|20110128221535.000|TR0|
20110128221535.000|20110128221537.000|TR0|And Kristian is one of our iReporters.  He 
20110128221537.000|20110128221539.000|TR0|was a -- he's a tourist vacationing in 
20110128221539.000|20110128221542.000|TR0|Cairo, by chance.  And he was an 
20110128221542.000|20110128221544.000|TR0|eyewitness to what he saw.
20110128221544.000|20110128221546.000|TR0|
20110128221546.000|20110128221549.000|TR0|Fred Pleitgen, don't go away.  We're going 
20110128221549.000|20110128221551.000|TR0|to be in close touch with you, as well.
20110128221551.000|20110128221553.000|TR0|
20110128221553.000|20110128221556.000|TR0|President Obama, right now, is walking a 
20110128221556.000|20110128221558.000|TR0|very, very fine line in the U.S. response 
20110128221558.000|20110128221600.000|TR0|to this violence and unrest in Egypt right 
20110128221600.000|20110128221603.000|TR0|now. We're going to try to get to the 
20110128221603.000|20110128221605.000|TR0|bottom of why he hasn't spoken with the 
20110128221605.000|20110128221607.000|TR0|Egyptian president.
20110128221607.000|20110128221610.000|TR0|
20110128221610.000|20110128221612.000|TR0|Where is Hosni Mubarak right now?
20110128221612.000|20110128221614.000|TR0|
20110128221614.000|20110128221617.000|TR0|Is he in Cairo?
20110128221617.000|20110128221619.000|TR0|
20110128221619.000|20110128221621.000|TR0|Is he still in Egypt?
20110128221621.000|20110128221624.000|TR0|
20110128221624.000|20110128221626.000|TR0|Is he getting ready to leave the country?
20110128221626.000|20110128221629.000|TR0|
20110128221629.000|20110128221631.000|TR0|These are questions we may be knowing -- 
20110128221631.000|20110128221633.000|TR0|we may be getting some answers to very, 
20110128221633.000|20110128221636.000|TR0|very soon.
20110128221636.000|20110128221638.000|TR0|
20110128221638.000|20110128221640.000|TR0|And Americans are demonstrating support 
20110128221640.000|20110128221643.000|TR0|for the protesters in Egypt.  But there's 
20110128221643.000|20110128221645.000|TR0|now talk that U.S. financial support for 
20110128221645.000|20110128221647.000|TR0|that country -- billions and billions of 
20110128221647.000|20110128221650.000|TR0|dollars every single year -- could be in 
20110128221650.000|20110128221652.000|TR0|jeopardy.
20110128221652.000|20110128221654.000|TR0|
20110128221654.000|20110128221657.000|TR0|And as we go to break, amazing video from 
20110128221657.000|20110128221659.000|TR0|earlier.
20110128221659.000|20110128221701.000|TR0|

20110128221704.000|20110128221706.000|TR0|
20110128221706.000|20110128221708.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  It's 12:15 a.m. now 
20110128221708.000|20110128221711.000|TR0|in Cairo.  Egyptian television just 
20110128221711.000|20110128221713.000|TR0|reporting that they are expecting a major 
20110128221713.000|20110128221715.000|TR0|statement from the Egyptian president, 
20110128221715.000|20110128221718.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak, to the people of Egypt.
20110128221718.000|20110128221720.000|TR0|
20110128221720.000|20110128221722.000|TR0|We'll believe it when we see it, because 
20110128221722.000|20110128221725.000|TR0|we've been hearing rumors all day that 
20110128221725.000|20110128221727.000|TR0|President Mubarak was going to be speaking 
20110128221727.000|20110128221729.000|TR0|on Egyptian television to the Egyptian 
20110128221729.000|20110128221732.000|TR0|people.  So far, he's been a no show.  
20110128221732.000|20110128221734.000|TR0|We'll see if in fact this happens.     But 
20110128221734.000|20110128221736.000|TR0|Egyptian television just moments ago 
20110128221736.000|20110128221739.000|TR0|saying we will be hearing from the 
20110128221739.000|20110128221741.000|TR0|Egyptian leader shortly.  Let's see if 
20110128221741.000|20110128221743.000|TR0|that actually happens or if we hear from 
20110128221743.000|20110128221746.000|TR0|someone else.  It's after midnight, as 
20110128221746.000|20110128221748.000|TR0|I've been pointing out, already in Cairo.
20110128221748.000|20110128221750.000|TR0|
20110128221750.000|20110128221753.000|TR0|The breaking news out of Egypt is forcing 
20110128221753.000|20110128221755.000|TR0|the Obama administration to rethink its 
20110128221755.000|20110128221757.000|TR0|relationship with one of its most 
20110128221757.000|20110128221800.000|TR0|important allies in the entire world.  The

20110128221835.000|20110128221837.000|TR0|why President Obama is getting frequent 
20110128221837.000|20110128221839.000|TR0|updates beginning with a memo put together 
20110128221839.000|20110128221842.000|TR0|overnight by his national security adviser 
20110128221842.000|20110128221844.000|TR0|Tom Donilon, and then that usual daily

20110128221846.000|20110128221849.000|TR0|usually focuses on a whole host of issues

20110128221851.000|20110128221853.000|TR0|in Egypt.  We're told that that lasted for 
20110128221853.000|20110128221856.000|TR0|about 40 minutes.

20110128221858.000|20110128221900.000|TR0|The White House is trying not to take any 
20110128221900.000|20110128221903.000|TR0|sides in this unrest, but it's a very 
20110128221903.000|20110128221905.000|TR0|difficult balancing act from one of the 
20110128221905.000|20110128221908.000|TR0|U.S.' key allies.

20110128221931.000|20110128221933.000|TR0|translator): -- in a very specific 
20110128221933.000|20110128221936.000|TR0|situation.  We all honestly should stand 
20110128221936.000|20110128221938.000|TR0|with each other for this country.
20110128221938.000|20110128221940.000|TR0|
20110128221940.000|20110128221943.000|TR0|I saw the demonstrations at first and what 
20110128221943.000|20110128221945.000|TR0|it wanted.  I told the government to give 
20110128221945.000|20110128221947.000|TR0|-- to give them -- to give them the space 
20110128221947.000|20110128221950.000|TR0|to tell what they want and what they need.
20110128221950.000|20110128221952.000|TR0|
20110128221952.000|20110128221954.000|TR0|After that -- after that, I was so sorry 
20110128221954.000|20110128221957.000|TR0|for what happened with the injured 
20110128221957.000|20110128221959.000|TR0|demonstrators and the officers.  The 
20110128221959.000|20110128222001.000|TR0|government did what it was asked, and it 
20110128222001.000|20110128222004.000|TR0|was obvious -- it was obvious that the 
20110128222004.000|20110128222006.000|TR0|armed forces worked with our youth and 
20110128222006.000|20110128222008.000|TR0|protected it, and respected them to be 
20110128222008.000|20110128222011.000|TR0|peaceful in their demonstration under the 
20110128222011.000|20110128222013.000|TR0|law and before it transferred into chaos 
20110128222013.000|20110128222015.000|TR0|and threatened the law and the life of 
20110128222015.000|20110128222018.000|TR0|every citizen.
20110128222018.000|20110128222020.000|TR0|
20110128222020.000|20110128222022.000|TR0|These demonstrations and what we saw 
20110128222022.000|20110128222025.000|TR0|before that in the years before, it 
20110128222025.000|20110128222027.000|TR0|shouldn't have happened before -- it 
20110128222027.000|20110128222029.000|TR0|shouldn't have happened due to the big 
20110128222029.000|20110128222032.000|TR0|gaps of freedom that were given.       As 
20110128222032.000|20110128222034.000|TR0|the president of this country and with all 
20110128222034.000|20110128222036.000|TR0|the constitution -- with all the power 
20110128222036.000|20110128222039.000|TR0|that the constitution gave me, I assure 
20110128222039.000|20110128222041.000|TR0|you that he's working for -- that I'm 
20110128222041.000|20110128222043.000|TR0|working for the people and giving freedoms 
20110128222043.000|20110128222046.000|TR0|of opinion, as long as you're respecting 
20110128222046.000|20110128222048.000|TR0|the law.
20110128222048.000|20110128222050.000|TR0|
20110128222050.000|20110128222053.000|TR0|There's a very little line between freedom 
20110128222053.000|20110128222055.000|TR0|and chaos.  I am absolutely on the side of 
20110128222055.000|20110128222057.000|TR0|the freedom of the each citizen, and at 
20110128222057.000|20110128222100.000|TR0|the same time I am on the side of the 
20110128222100.000|20110128222102.000|TR0|security of Egypt and I would not let 
20110128222102.000|20110128222104.000|TR0|anything dangerous happen that would 
20110128222104.000|20110128222107.000|TR0|threaten the peace and the law and the 
20110128222107.000|20110128222109.000|TR0|future of the country.
20110128222109.000|20110128222111.000|TR0|
20110128222111.000|20110128222114.000|TR0|Egypt is the biggest region in its -- in 
20110128222114.000|20110128222116.000|TR0|its region -- in its area, and it's under 
20110128222116.000|20110128222118.000|TR0|the law of its constitution, we have to be 
20110128222118.000|20110128222121.000|TR0|careful of anything that would allow 
20110128222121.000|20110128222123.000|TR0|chaos.  No democracy would be there if we 
20110128222123.000|20110128222125.000|TR0|allow chaos.

20110128222128.000|20110128222130.000|TR0|These demonstrations wanted to -- wanted 
20110128222130.000|20110128222132.000|TR0|to speak about their opinion to give more 
20110128222132.000|20110128222135.000|TR0|job opportunities and to lower the prices 
20110128222135.000|20110128222137.000|TR0|and to fight -- and to fight the poor.
20110128222137.000|20110128222139.000|TR0|
20110128222139.000|20110128222142.000|TR0|I know -- I know all that these things, 
20110128222142.000|20110128222144.000|TR0|these issues that the people are asking.  
20110128222144.000|20110128222146.000|TR0|I've never been separated from it, and I 
20110128222146.000|20110128222149.000|TR0|work for it every day.  But what we are 
20110128222149.000|20110128222151.000|TR0|facing as a problem and what we have as 
20110128222151.000|20110128222154.000|TR0|goal goals, terrorism is not going to 
20110128222154.000|20110128222156.000|TR0|allow it to happen.  But communication and 
20110128222156.000|20110128222158.000|TR0|talking will allow it to happen -- to be 
20110128222158.000|20110128222201.000|TR0|achieved.

20110128222203.000|20110128222205.000|TR0|It's not going to be allowed that things 
20110128222205.000|20110128222208.000|TR0|will be robbed and stolen and fires set.  
20110128222208.000|20110128222210.000|TR0|You won't shake my opinion that the 
20110128222210.000|20110128222212.000|TR0|economy needs to be fixed, the society 
20110128222212.000|20110128222215.000|TR0|needs to be fixed for a better Egyptian 
20110128222215.000|20110128222217.000|TR0|society and a Democratic one to be open to 
20110128222217.000|20110128222219.000|TR0|the world.

20110128222222.000|20110128222224.000|TR0|I'll always be on the side of the poor.  
20110128222224.000|20110128222226.000|TR0|And I'm convinced that economy is not to 
20110128222226.000|20110128222229.000|TR0|be kept for only the economists, and I am 
20110128222229.000|20110128222231.000|TR0|with bettering the economy.

20110128222245.000|20110128222247.000|TR0|In these demonstrations, the chaos and the 
20110128222247.000|20110128222250.000|TR0|fires is a plan -- is a plan to actually 
20110128222250.000|20110128222252.000|TR0|wreck the security.  Every Egyptian should 
20110128222252.000|20110128222254.000|TR0|care for the -- for the head of the 
20110128222254.000|20110128222257.000|TR0|country, not with causing fires or 
20110128222257.000|20110128222259.000|TR0|wrecking private and public businesses.  
20110128222259.000|20110128222301.000|TR0|But things will actually get to a solution 
20110128222301.000|20110128222304.000|TR0|in the future by communication and

20110128222311.000|20110128222313.000|TR0|as a president, but as an Egyptian.  I 
20110128222313.000|20110128222315.000|TR0|spent war and peace in this country, very 
20110128222315.000|20110128222318.000|TR0|hard times. We overcame it, we were united 
20110128222318.000|20110128222320.000|TR0|as people.  But when we knew our way and 
20110128222320.000|20110128222322.000|TR0|we set our goals, the road that we chose 
20110128222322.000|20110128222325.000|TR0|to fix is not to be ignored.

20110128222332.000|20110128222334.000|TR0|for make new job opportunities and raise 
20110128222334.000|20110128222336.000|TR0|the economy and develop and to stand by

20110128222339.000|20110128222341.000|TR0|salaries, this is what's going to make our 
20110128222341.000|20110128222343.000|TR0|future and we can't do that unless we are

20110128222348.000|20110128222350.000|TR0|We need to build on what we already have

20110128222353.000|20110128222355.000|TR0|in the past few days puts -- puts fear in

20110128222409.000|20110128222411.000|TR0|live in the citizen or to let them tell us 
20110128222411.000|20110128222414.000|TR0|what's going to happen in the future.
20110128222414.000|20110128222416.000|TR0|
20110128222416.000|20110128222418.000|TR0|I ask the government to resign today, and 
20110128222418.000|20110128222421.000|TR0|I will tell the new government from 
20110128222421.000|20110128222423.000|TR0|tomorrow in very specific goals to work 
20110128222423.000|20110128222425.000|TR0|with the current situation.
20110128222425.000|20110128222428.000|TR0|
20110128222428.000|20110128222430.000|TR0|I would say again, I will not be easy to 
20110128222430.000|20110128222433.000|TR0|take any -- to decide anything unless it's 
20110128222433.000|20110128222435.000|TR0|for the Egyptians.  And I will protect 
20110128222435.000|20110128222437.000|TR0|Egypt.  I took oath to protect Egypt and 
20110128222437.000|20110128222440.000|TR0|everybody.
20110128222440.000|20110128222442.000|TR0|
20110128222442.000|20110128222444.000|TR0|God have mercy.
20110128222444.000|20110128222447.000|TR0|
20110128222447.000|20110128222449.000|TR0|BLITZER:  There you heard it, the Egyptian 
20110128222449.000|20110128222451.000|TR0|President Hosni Mubarak calling for calm, 
20110128222451.000|20110128222454.000|TR0|saying he's forced the government to 
20110128222454.000|20110128222456.000|TR0|resign, he'll appoint a new government, he 
20110128222456.000|20110128222458.000|TR0|says, tomorrow.  He says the folks at 
20110128222458.000|20110128222501.000|TR0|Egypt have to obey the law otherwise there 
20110128222501.000|20110128222503.000|TR0|will be a disaster.
20110128222503.000|20110128222505.000|TR0|
20110128222505.000|20110128222508.000|TR0|But he gave no indication whatsoever that 
20110128222508.000|20110128222510.000|TR0|he was at all ready to leave the country, 
20110128222510.000|20110128222512.000|TR0|to abandon his presidency.  He says that 
20110128222512.000|20110128222515.000|TR0|he has a responsibility by the Egyptian 
20110128222515.000|20110128222517.000|TR0|constitution to maintain law and order 
20110128222517.000|20110128222519.000|TR0|right now, so he says he is staying put.
20110128222519.000|20110128222522.000|TR0|
20110128222522.000|20110128222524.000|TR0|Let's bring in our own Fareed Zakaria, 
20110128222524.000|20110128222526.000|TR0|he's watching all of this unfold he's been 
20110128222526.000|20110128222529.000|TR0|a student of what's happening in the 
20110128222529.000|20110128222531.000|TR0|Middle East and Egypt for a long time.
20110128222531.000|20110128222533.000|TR0|
20110128222533.000|20110128222536.000|TR0|I think it's fair to say, Fareed, that the 
20110128222536.000|20110128222538.000|TR0|Egyptian president was defiant in these 
20110128222538.000|20110128222540.000|TR0|brief remarks to the Egyptian people.
20110128222540.000|20110128222543.000|TR0|
20110128222543.000|20110128222545.000|TR0|FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST, "FAREED ZAKARIA 
20110128222545.000|20110128222547.000|TR0|GPS":  He was very tough, Wolf.  I think 
20110128222547.000|20110128222550.000|TR0|that the Egyptian government, Mubarak 
20110128222550.000|20110128222552.000|TR0|particularly, has made the decision that 
20110128222552.000|20110128222554.000|TR0|the Egyptian state can hold.
20110128222554.000|20110128222557.000|TR0|
20110128222557.000|20110128222559.000|TR0|Remember, this is one of the oldest states 
20110128222559.000|20110128222601.000|TR0|in the world.  This is the pharaoh's 
20110128222601.000|20110128222604.000|TR0|government, almost a continuous line of 
20110128222604.000|20110128222606.000|TR0|administration, very powerful army, 
20110128222606.000|20110128222608.000|TR0|largest in the Middle East.  And Mubarak 
20110128222608.000|20110128222611.000|TR0|has decided that in the end he can 
20110128222611.000|20110128222613.000|TR0|prevail, so he does not need to make any 
20110128222613.000|20110128222615.000|TR0|preemptive concessions.
20110128222615.000|20110128222618.000|TR0|
20110128222618.000|20110128222620.000|TR0|I think it might prove to be a 
20110128222620.000|20110128222622.000|TR0|miscalculation, but that is clearly 
20110128222622.000|20110128222625.000|TR0|Mubarak's judgment.
20110128222625.000|20110128222627.000|TR0|
20110128222627.000|20110128222629.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So what can we expect in the 
20110128222629.000|20110128222632.000|TR0|next few days?  More of these riots and 
20110128222632.000|20110128222634.000|TR0|demonstrations?  Will these words by 
20110128222634.000|20110128222636.000|TR0|President Mubarak have any calming effect 
20110128222636.000|20110128222639.000|TR0|on the street?
20110128222639.000|20110128222641.000|TR0|
20110128222641.000|20110128222643.000|TR0|ZAKARIA:  Well, in passing, he mentioned 
20110128222643.000|20110128222646.000|TR0|that he was going to dismiss the entire 
20110128222646.000|20110128222648.000|TR0|government.  I assume there now the 
20110128222648.000|20110128222650.000|TR0|government, the prime minister and the 
20110128222650.000|20110128222653.000|TR0|ministers serve at his pleasure, so if he 
20110128222653.000|20110128222655.000|TR0|dismisses them he will simply appoint a 
20110128222655.000|20110128222657.000|TR0|new slate.
20110128222657.000|20110128222700.000|TR0|
20110128222700.000|20110128222702.000|TR0|It is possible that he will try to find 
20110128222702.000|20110128222704.000|TR0|figures who have some more popular appeal, 
20110128222704.000|20110128222707.000|TR0|but, you know, my sense is that the 
20110128222707.000|20110128222709.000|TR0|Egyptian political life has been frozen 
20110128222709.000|20110128222711.000|TR0|for decades.  I mean, Mubarak has been in 
20110128222711.000|20110128222714.000|TR0|power for 28 years, martial law has 
20110128222714.000|20110128222716.000|TR0|existed for 30 years.  So it's very 
20110128222716.000|20110128222719.000|TR0|difficult to understand how he would make 
20110128222719.000|20110128222721.000|TR0|that decision without some kind of 
20110128222721.000|20110128222723.000|TR0|political process in which you broaden 
20110128222723.000|20110128222726.000|TR0|people and consulted with them.
20110128222726.000|20110128222728.000|TR0|
20110128222728.000|20110128222730.000|TR0|I don't know whom he would appoint.  If 
20110128222730.000|20110128222733.000|TR0|it's a reshuffling of the deck, I don't 
20110128222733.000|20110128222735.000|TR0|know whether it would work.
20110128222735.000|20110128222737.000|TR0|
20110128222737.000|20110128222740.000|TR0|The odd thing, of course, is many of the 
20110128222740.000|20110128222742.000|TR0|people in his government, the prime 
20110128222742.000|20110128222744.000|TR0|minister, the trade minister, the finance 
20110128222744.000|20110128222747.000|TR0|minister, these are young reformers who 
20110128222747.000|20110128222749.000|TR0|have reasonably clean records. The problem 
20110128222749.000|20110128222751.000|TR0|the Egyptian public has is with Mubarak, 
20110128222751.000|20110128222754.000|TR0|not with his government.
20110128222754.000|20110128222756.000|TR0|
20110128222756.000|20110128222758.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes.  Fareed, hold on for one 
20110128222758.000|20110128222801.000|TR0|moment.  Don't go away.
20110128222801.000|20110128222803.000|TR0|
20110128222803.000|20110128222805.000|TR0|Fred Pleitgen is our man on the scene in 
20110128222805.000|20110128222808.000|TR0|Cairo right now.
20110128222808.000|20110128222810.000|TR0|
20110128222810.000|20110128222812.000|TR0|Fred, tell us what's going on, because I 
20110128222812.000|20110128222815.000|TR0|understand some protesters are really 
20110128222815.000|20110128222817.000|TR0|close to you.
20110128222817.000|20110128222819.000|TR0|
20110128222819.000|20110128222822.000|TR0|FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL 
20110128222822.000|20110128222824.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. They're really close 
20110128222824.000|20110128222826.000|TR0|to us.  You can see them right now sort of 
20110128222826.000|20110128222829.000|TR0|in front of our building.
20110128222829.000|20110128222831.000|TR0|
20110128222831.000|20110128222833.000|TR0|What they're doing, Wolf, is making their 
20110128222833.000|20110128222836.000|TR0|way to the Information Ministry right now, 
20110128222836.000|20110128222838.000|TR0|and as you can see, the people there are 
20110128222838.000|20110128222840.000|TR0|quite angry.  They have been chanting 
20110128222840.000|20110128222843.000|TR0|things like "We want him out!  We want him 
20110128222843.000|20110128222845.000|TR0|out!  We want a change!"
20110128222845.000|20110128222847.000|TR0|
20110128222847.000|20110128222850.000|TR0|They came by here.  And, of course, these 
20110128222850.000|20110128222852.000|TR0|people came by here just really a couple 
20110128222852.000|20110128222854.000|TR0|of seconds after Mubarak's speech was 
20110128222854.000|20110128222857.000|TR0|over.  So, clearly, he didn't persuade the 
20110128222857.000|20110128222859.000|TR0|people that you're seeing here very close 
20110128222859.000|20110128222901.000|TR0|to our office building with the words that 
20110128222901.000|20110128222904.000|TR0|he was saying.  And they are clearly, from 
20110128222904.000|20110128222906.000|TR0|what we're hearing up here, are clearly 
20110128222906.000|20110128222908.000|TR0|calling for him to step down.
20110128222908.000|20110128222911.000|TR0|
20110128222911.000|20110128222913.000|TR0|As you can see, right now I would say it's 
20110128222913.000|20110128222915.000|TR0|a couple of hundred people.  There's more 
20110128222915.000|20110128222918.000|TR0|people sort of filing down the streets.
20110128222918.000|20110128222920.000|TR0|
20110128222920.000|20110128222922.000|TR0|If we can sort of pan the other way, right 
20110128222922.000|20110128222925.000|TR0|now the group of people are getting a 
20110128222925.000|20110128222927.000|TR0|little bit smaller, but certainly there 
20110128222927.000|20110128222929.000|TR0|will be more to come.  They are also 
20110128222929.000|20110128222932.000|TR0|conglomerating here in this area.
20110128222932.000|20110128222934.000|TR0|
20110128222934.000|20110128222936.000|TR0|It's one of the buildings, Wolf, here in 
20110128222936.000|20110128222939.000|TR0|downtown Cairo where the military stepped 
20110128222939.000|20110128222941.000|TR0|in after the police clearly wasn't capable 
20110128222941.000|20110128222943.000|TR0|of dealing with the situation, and where 
20110128222943.000|20110128222946.000|TR0|the military sort of calmed the situation 
20110128222946.000|20110128222948.000|TR0|down as things were getting out of control 
20110128222948.000|20110128222950.000|TR0|here.  But now you can clearly see more 
20110128222950.000|20110128222953.000|TR0|and more people sort of filing towards 
20110128222953.000|20110128222955.000|TR0|this area, clearly not happy with what 
20110128222955.000|20110128222957.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak said.       And it's really 
20110128222957.000|20110128223000.000|TR0|something I've been seeing the whole day, 
20110128223000.000|20110128223002.000|TR0|is that protesters that I've been speaking 
20110128223002.000|20110128223005.000|TR0|to have been telling me they want this 
20110128223005.000|20110128223007.000|TR0|government, they want Hosni Mubarak to 
20110128223007.000|20110128223009.000|TR0|step down.  They want him to step aside.  
20110128223009.000|20110128223012.000|TR0|They felt that it's time for a change.
20110128223012.000|20110128223014.000|TR0|
20110128223014.000|20110128223016.000|TR0|They didn't have enough social freedom, 
20110128223016.000|20110128223019.000|TR0|enough economic opportunities, so clearly 
20110128223019.000|20110128223021.000|TR0|very, very unhappy people who were not 
20110128223021.000|20110128223023.000|TR0|made any more happy by what they just 
20110128223023.000|20110128223026.000|TR0|heard from the Egyptian president, even 
20110128223026.000|20110128223028.000|TR0|though, of course, he did announce that he 
20110128223028.000|20110128223030.000|TR0|had asked the government to resign.  And 
20110128223030.000|20110128223033.000|TR0|one of the things that has been a demand 
20110128223033.000|20110128223035.000|TR0|of the protesters so far was that the 
20110128223035.000|20110128223037.000|TR0|interior minister resign.  So one of those 
20110128223037.000|20110128223040.000|TR0|demands seemingly were met.
20110128223040.000|20110128223042.000|TR0|
20110128223042.000|20110128223044.000|TR0|And now you can see those people -- I 
20110128223044.000|20110128223047.000|TR0|don't know how well you can see it -- are 
20110128223047.000|20110128223049.000|TR0|moving towards the building of the 
20110128223049.000|20110128223051.000|TR0|Information Ministry. They had tried to 
20110128223051.000|20110128223054.000|TR0|storm that building before.  Apparently, 
20110128223054.000|20110128223056.000|TR0|they got into some of the rooms.
20110128223056.000|20110128223058.000|TR0|
20110128223058.000|20110128223101.000|TR0|But clearly the situation, Wolf, I was 
20110128223101.000|20110128223103.000|TR0|telling you before it was getting more and 
20110128223103.000|20110128223105.000|TR0|more quiet.  Now there are more and more 
20110128223105.000|20110128223108.000|TR0|people filing into the streets of the 
20110128223108.000|20110128223110.000|TR0|Egyptian capital again -- Wolf.
20110128223110.000|20110128223112.000|TR0|
20110128223112.000|20110128223115.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes.  I suspect most of the 
20110128223115.000|20110128223117.000|TR0|Egyptian population, at least those who 
20110128223117.000|20110128223119.000|TR0|were watching television, obviously, were 
20110128223119.000|20110128223122.000|TR0|watching Mubarak, and this may have 
20110128223122.000|20110128223124.000|TR0|ignited more of the negative reaction.
20110128223124.000|20110128223126.000|TR0|
20110128223126.000|20110128223129.000|TR0|Earlier in the day, Fred, I take it they 
20110128223129.000|20110128223131.000|TR0|went ahead and ransacked, they looted the 
20110128223131.000|20110128223133.000|TR0|chief political party headquarters of 
20110128223133.000|20110128223136.000|TR0|President Mubarak.  And now you say they 
20110128223136.000|20110128223138.000|TR0|are going after the Information Ministry, 
20110128223138.000|20110128223140.000|TR0|which is in charge of state television, 
20110128223140.000|20110128223143.000|TR0|all of the newspapers, and all of that.  
20110128223143.000|20110128223145.000|TR0|So it looks like they are really going 
20110128223145.000|20110128223147.000|TR0|after some of the pillars of the entire 
20110128223147.000|20110128223150.000|TR0|Mubarak regime.
20110128223150.000|20110128223152.000|TR0|
20110128223152.000|20110128223154.000|TR0|Is that a fair assessment, Fred?
20110128223154.000|20110128223157.000|TR0|
20110128223157.000|20110128223159.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  It is an absolutely fair 
20110128223159.000|20110128223201.000|TR0|assessment, Wolf, and it's not only one of 
20110128223201.000|20110128223204.000|TR0|the pillars of the Mubarak regime, it's 
20110128223204.000|20110128223206.000|TR0|also one of the most hated pillars of the 
20110128223206.000|20110128223208.000|TR0|Mubarak regime.  There's many people here 
20110128223208.000|20110128223211.000|TR0|in Cairo and even Egypt who would like to 
20110128223211.000|20110128223213.000|TR0|loot that building and burn it down.
20110128223213.000|20110128223215.000|TR0|
20110128223215.000|20110128223218.000|TR0|It is one where I've seen the people in 
20110128223218.000|20110128223220.000|TR0|front of that building simply chanting, 
20110128223220.000|20110128223222.000|TR0|"It's a sham!  It's a sham!"  Of course, 
20110128223222.000|20110128223225.000|TR0|referring to the information that is 
20110128223225.000|20110128223227.000|TR0|coming out regularly of the Information 
20110128223227.000|20110128223229.000|TR0|Ministry and, of course, from state media 
20110128223229.000|20110128223232.000|TR0|here in Egypt.  So certainly this is a 
20110128223232.000|20110128223234.000|TR0|place that really ignites people.
20110128223234.000|20110128223236.000|TR0|
20110128223236.000|20110128223239.000|TR0|It was even worse earlier in the day, when 
20110128223239.000|20110128223241.000|TR0|you had the police surrounding that 
20110128223241.000|20110128223244.000|TR0|building, when you had the police trying 
20110128223244.000|20110128223246.000|TR0|to fend off the protesters using, of 
20110128223246.000|20110128223248.000|TR0|course, tear gas, using batons.  And the 
20110128223248.000|20110128223251.000|TR0|protesters told us in some cases even 
20110128223251.000|20110128223253.000|TR0|using live ammunition and, of course, 
20110128223253.000|20110128223255.000|TR0|rubber bullets.
20110128223255.000|20110128223258.000|TR0|
20110128223258.000|20110128223300.000|TR0|The police themselves are also a lightning 
20110128223300.000|20110128223302.000|TR0|rod at this point in time here in this 
20110128223302.000|20110128223305.000|TR0|country.  A lot of people here have been 
20110128223305.000|20110128223307.000|TR0|mistreated by policemen in their lives.  A 
20110128223307.000|20110128223309.000|TR0|lot of people fear the police forces. And 
20110128223309.000|20110128223312.000|TR0|so certainly though the police defending 
20110128223312.000|20110128223314.000|TR0|the Information Ministry was certainly 
20110128223314.000|20110128223316.000|TR0|something that ignited a lot of anger 
20110128223316.000|20110128223319.000|TR0|throughout the day, but now you can really 
20110128223319.000|20110128223321.000|TR0|see that once that that speech ended, 
20110128223321.000|20110128223323.000|TR0|people have begun filing, coming down the 
20110128223323.000|20110128223326.000|TR0|streets, chanting anti- Mubarak slogans, 
20110128223326.000|20110128223328.000|TR0|calling for Hosni Mubarak to step down.
20110128223328.000|20110128223330.000|TR0|
20110128223330.000|20110128223333.000|TR0|And you can see more and more people are 
20110128223333.000|20110128223335.000|TR0|coming this way.  I mean, it seems like 
20110128223335.000|20110128223337.000|TR0|it's a trickle of people right now, but 
20110128223337.000|20110128223340.000|TR0|once they get to the Information Ministry, 
20110128223340.000|20110128223342.000|TR0|it really turns out to be quite a big 
20110128223342.000|20110128223344.000|TR0|crowd.  And right now I would say it's 
20110128223344.000|20110128223347.000|TR0|about maybe 300, 400 people there right 
20110128223347.000|20110128223349.000|TR0|now, but we are expecting more and more 
20110128223349.000|20110128223351.000|TR0|people to come in, more and more cars now 
20110128223351.000|20110128223354.000|TR0|coming in as well.
20110128223354.000|20110128223356.000|TR0|
20110128223356.000|20110128223358.000|TR0|And, you know, one of the things that 
20110128223358.000|20110128223401.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak said in his speech there is 
20110128223401.000|20110128223403.000|TR0|that he couldn't let chaos and lawlessness 
20110128223403.000|20110128223405.000|TR0|prevail here in this country.  I have to 
20110128223405.000|20110128223408.000|TR0|say, one of the things that I noticed at 
20110128223408.000|20110128223410.000|TR0|the demonstrations today is that people, 
20110128223410.000|20110128223412.000|TR0|by and large, were not ransacking or 
20110128223412.000|20110128223415.000|TR0|destroying private people's property.
20110128223415.000|20110128223417.000|TR0|
20110128223417.000|20110128223419.000|TR0|There were cars going through the 
20110128223419.000|20110128223422.000|TR0|demonstrations.  The demonstrators always 
20110128223422.000|20110128223424.000|TR0|went to the side and let them through.  It 
20110128223424.000|20110128223426.000|TR0|was really anger at government 
20110128223426.000|20110128223429.000|TR0|institutions, anger at the police force, 
20110128223429.000|20110128223431.000|TR0|anger, of course, at buildings like the 
20110128223431.000|20110128223433.000|TR0|one that's occupied by the national party 
20110128223433.000|20110128223436.000|TR0|that people are venting at and that, of 
20110128223436.000|20110128223438.000|TR0|course, then were set on fire and looted.
20110128223438.000|20110128223440.000|TR0|
20110128223440.000|20110128223443.000|TR0|So, it really isn't the case that there is 
20110128223443.000|20110128223445.000|TR0|large chaos here in the city.  It is 
20110128223445.000|20110128223447.000|TR0|something that is fairly directed at 
20110128223447.000|20110128223450.000|TR0|government institutions, even though, of 
20110128223450.000|20110128223452.000|TR0|course, for the larger part of the day 
20110128223452.000|20110128223454.000|TR0|there were some pretty intense street 
20110128223454.000|20110128223457.000|TR0|battles here in downtown Cairo -- Wolf.
20110128223457.000|20110128223459.000|TR0|
20110128223459.000|20110128223501.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, Fred.  Hold on a 
20110128223501.000|20110128223504.000|TR0|movement.  Don't go away. I want to bring 
20110128223504.000|20110128223506.000|TR0|Fareed Zakaria back into this conversation.
20110128223506.000|20110128223508.000|TR0|
20110128223508.000|20110128223511.000|TR0|Fareed, these protesters, they hate the 
20110128223511.000|20110128223513.000|TR0|police.  That's why they are going after 
20110128223513.000|20110128223515.000|TR0|the interior minister.  They hate the 
20110128223515.000|20110128223518.000|TR0|interior minister, which is in charge of 
20110128223518.000|20110128223520.000|TR0|the police.
20110128223520.000|20110128223522.000|TR0|
20110128223522.000|20110128223525.000|TR0|The key question is, what happens with the 
20110128223525.000|20110128223527.000|TR0|powerful Egyptian army?  Because a lot of 
20110128223527.000|20110128223530.000|TR0|folks in Egypt respect the army.  And I 
20110128223530.000|20110128223532.000|TR0|think the decisive element in who leads 
20110128223532.000|20110128223534.000|TR0|and who doesn't lead will be where the 
20110128223534.000|20110128223537.000|TR0|army in the end decides to stand.
20110128223537.000|20110128223539.000|TR0|
20110128223539.000|20110128223541.000|TR0|What do you think the Egyptian army is 
20110128223541.000|20110128223544.000|TR0|going to do?
20110128223544.000|20110128223546.000|TR0|
20110128223546.000|20110128223548.000|TR0|ZAKARIA:  Well, my sense, Wolf, first of 
20110128223548.000|20110128223551.000|TR0|all, you're absolutely right.  The key 
20110128223551.000|20110128223553.000|TR0|here is how the Egyptian army decides to 
20110128223553.000|20110128223555.000|TR0|go.
20110128223555.000|20110128223558.000|TR0|
20110128223558.000|20110128223600.000|TR0|My guess is that Mubarak consulted very 
20110128223600.000|20110128223602.000|TR0|closely with them. Remember, he is a 
20110128223602.000|20110128223605.000|TR0|former army officer himself.  And my sense 
20110128223605.000|20110128223607.000|TR0|is that they would have agreed with his 
20110128223607.000|20110128223609.000|TR0|position.
20110128223609.000|20110128223612.000|TR0|
20110128223612.000|20110128223614.000|TR0|Also remember they have curfews everywhere 
20110128223614.000|20110128223616.000|TR0|in Egypt.  My guess is those would have to 
20110128223616.000|20110128223619.000|TR0|be enforced with some help from the army.
20110128223619.000|20110128223621.000|TR0|
20110128223621.000|20110128223623.000|TR0|So it seems at this stage as though the 
20110128223623.000|20110128223626.000|TR0|army is deciding to back the Mubarak 
20110128223626.000|20110128223628.000|TR0|regime.  In other words, they are not 
20110128223628.000|20110128223630.000|TR0|doing what they did in Tunisia.  And for 
20110128223630.000|20110128223633.000|TR0|that reason, perhaps Mubarak has decided 
20110128223633.000|20110128223635.000|TR0|to be as tough as he's been.
20110128223635.000|20110128223637.000|TR0|
20110128223637.000|20110128223640.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Because if he has the support of 
20110128223640.000|20110128223642.000|TR0|the military, obviously that would be 
20110128223642.000|20110128223644.000|TR0|very, very significant.
20110128223644.000|20110128223647.000|TR0|
20110128223647.000|20110128223649.000|TR0|There has been a curfew imposed tonight, 
20110128223649.000|20110128223651.000|TR0|but now it's well after midnight.  It's 
20110128223651.000|20110128223654.000|TR0|after 12:30 a.m. in Cairo.  You see these 
20110128223654.000|20110128223656.000|TR0|hundreds of people gathering now as if 
20110128223656.000|20110128223658.000|TR0|they have been energized by President 
20110128223658.000|20110128223701.000|TR0|Mubarak's address to the nation on 
20110128223701.000|20110128223703.000|TR0|Egyptian state television.  It looks like 
20110128223703.000|20110128223705.000|TR0|they don't care about this curfew and the 
20110128223705.000|20110128223708.000|TR0|risks to themselves that this would entail.
20110128223708.000|20110128223710.000|TR0|
20110128223710.000|20110128223712.000|TR0|ZAKARIA:  Precisely.  I think they are 
20110128223712.000|20110128223715.000|TR0|gambling, probably correctly, that the 
20110128223715.000|20110128223717.000|TR0|army or the police is not going to shoot 
20110128223717.000|20110128223719.000|TR0|and is not going to try to disperse it  
20110128223719.000|20110128223722.000|TR0|Remember, as you pointed out, it's a few 
20110128223722.000|20110128223724.000|TR0|hundred people in Cairo.  The question 
20110128223724.000|20110128223726.000|TR0|really is, is this going to morph, is this 
20110128223726.000|20110128223729.000|TR0|going to grow?
20110128223729.000|20110128223731.000|TR0|
20110128223731.000|20110128223733.000|TR0|Clearly, the regime is making a 
20110128223733.000|20110128223736.000|TR0|calculation that says perhaps you'll have 
20110128223736.000|20110128223738.000|TR0|a few hundred, maybe a few thousand people 
20110128223738.000|20110128223740.000|TR0|in Cairo, but it's not going to engulf all 
20110128223740.000|20110128223743.000|TR0|of Egypt.  I'm still surprised that 
20110128223743.000|20110128223745.000|TR0|Mubarak did not try to offer more 
20110128223745.000|20110128223747.000|TR0|concessions, more of a political process 
20110128223747.000|20110128223750.000|TR0|forward.  Perhaps that will come later, 
20110128223750.000|20110128223752.000|TR0|but right now it seems as though they 
20110128223752.000|20110128223754.000|TR0|think they can ride the wave of these few 
20110128223754.000|20110128223757.000|TR0|hundred people demonstrating in front of 
20110128223757.000|20110128223759.000|TR0|the Information Ministry.
20110128223759.000|20110128223801.000|TR0|
20110128223801.000|20110128223804.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I agree, Fareed, because the 
20110128223804.000|20110128223806.000|TR0|only concession he really made, if in fact 
20110128223806.000|20110128223809.000|TR0|it is a concession, he said he's asked the 
20110128223809.000|20110128223811.000|TR0|government to resign today, and there will 
20110128223811.000|20110128223813.000|TR0|be a new government named tomorrow. But 
20110128223813.000|20110128223816.000|TR0|if, as you point out, if this is simply a 
20110128223816.000|20110128223818.000|TR0|reshuffling of the deck, that's not going 
20110128223818.000|20110128223820.000|TR0|to satisfy the demonstrators out there, 
20110128223820.000|20110128223823.000|TR0|because their anger isn't necessarily at 
20110128223823.000|20110128223825.000|TR0|who the finance minister is or the prime 
20110128223825.000|20110128223827.000|TR0|minister, for that matter, their anger is 
20110128223827.000|20110128223830.000|TR0|at the president, President Mubarak.
20110128223830.000|20110128223832.000|TR0|
20110128223832.000|20110128223834.000|TR0|ZAKARIA:  In a sense this all began, Wolf, 
20110128223834.000|20110128223837.000|TR0|when Egyptians began to realize over the 
20110128223837.000|20110128223839.000|TR0|past year that Hosni Mubarak intended to 
20110128223839.000|20110128223841.000|TR0|run one more time for a term in office.  
20110128223841.000|20110128223844.000|TR0|In other words, at 82, he was going to run 
20110128223844.000|20110128223846.000|TR0|again.  And that told them that the 
20110128223846.000|20110128223848.000|TR0|political system was going to be frozen 
20110128223848.000|20110128223851.000|TR0|for the next five years, perhaps for the 
20110128223851.000|20110128223853.000|TR0|next decade. And that I think made them 
20110128223853.000|20110128223855.000|TR0|think there was no hope for any kind of 
20110128223855.000|20110128223858.000|TR0|evolutionary change in Egypt, and thus 
20110128223858.000|20110128223900.000|TR0|they turned to more active measures, 
20110128223900.000|20110128223902.000|TR0|inspired, of course, by the Tunisian 
20110128223902.000|20110128223905.000|TR0|revolt.
20110128223905.000|20110128223907.000|TR0|
20110128223907.000|20110128223909.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Fareed, hold on a second, 
20110128223909.000|20110128223912.000|TR0|because Nic Robertson, our senior 
20110128223912.000|20110128223914.000|TR0|correspondent, is also in Egypt right now. 
20110128223914.000|20110128223916.000|TR0| I want to bring him into this 
20110128223916.000|20110128223919.000|TR0|conversation.
20110128223919.000|20110128223921.000|TR0|
20110128223921.000|20110128223923.000|TR0|Nic, you've been to Egypt many times over 
20110128223923.000|20110128223926.000|TR0|the years.  It looks like what started off 
20110128223926.000|20110128223928.000|TR0|in Tunisia has been spreading around the 
20110128223928.000|20110128223930.000|TR0|region, but the stakes in Egypt are 
20110128223930.000|20110128223933.000|TR0|enormous right now.
20110128223933.000|20110128223935.000|TR0|
20110128223935.000|20110128223937.000|TR0|Tell our viewers what you've seen, for 
20110128223937.000|20110128223940.000|TR0|example, over the past few hours.       
20110128223940.000|20110128223942.000|TR0|NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL 
20110128223942.000|20110128223944.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, I think the 
20110128223944.000|20110128223947.000|TR0|stakes have just got hugely higher, 
20110128223947.000|20110128223949.000|TR0|President Mubarak taking this position.  
20110128223949.000|20110128223951.000|TR0|It is the antithesis, the complete 
20110128223951.000|20110128223954.000|TR0|opposite of what everyone has been calling 
20110128223954.000|20110128223956.000|TR0|for.
20110128223956.000|20110128223958.000|TR0|
20110128223958.000|20110128224001.000|TR0|But what he appears to be setting the 
20110128224001.000|20110128224003.000|TR0|stage for now, a few hours ago we saw the 
20110128224003.000|20110128224005.000|TR0|army come on to the streets here, and 
20110128224005.000|20110128224008.000|TR0|everyone met them with rounds of applause, 
20110128224008.000|20110128224010.000|TR0|clapping and cheering them.  The army told 
20110128224010.000|20110128224012.000|TR0|them that they were there to protect the 
20110128224012.000|20110128224015.000|TR0|people.  The people accepted that.  They 
20110128224015.000|20110128224017.000|TR0|were happy.  They trusted the army.
20110128224017.000|20110128224019.000|TR0|
20110128224019.000|20110128224022.000|TR0|But when I talked to people just an hour 
20110128224022.000|20110128224024.000|TR0|ago, and I said, "Well, is the army here 
20110128224024.000|20110128224026.000|TR0|to support President Mubarak?"  They told 
20110128224026.000|20110128224029.000|TR0|me no, we hope not.  We hope that they are 
20110128224029.000|20110128224031.000|TR0|here for us, not President Mubarak.
20110128224031.000|20110128224033.000|TR0|
20110128224033.000|20110128224036.000|TR0|They are now going to realize the army 
20110128224036.000|20110128224038.000|TR0|that has essentially come on the streets 
20110128224038.000|20110128224040.000|TR0|by stealth, replacing the police who were 
20110128224040.000|20110128224043.000|TR0|defeated, and are now sitting at the 
20110128224043.000|20110128224045.000|TR0|street corners here, are going to be the 
20110128224045.000|20110128224047.000|TR0|force to be reckoned with tomorrow, 
20110128224047.000|20110128224050.000|TR0|because the demonstrators say they will 
20110128224050.000|20110128224052.000|TR0|come back and take on the institutions 
20110128224052.000|20110128224055.000|TR0|here, as we've seen them burning them in 
20110128224055.000|20110128224057.000|TR0|Cairo and Alexandria and other places.  
20110128224057.000|20110128224059.000|TR0|They will take on those institutions until 
20110128224059.000|20110128224102.000|TR0|President Mubarak is forced out, and 
20110128224102.000|20110128224104.000|TR0|that's going to mean taking on the army.
20110128224104.000|20110128224106.000|TR0|
20110128224106.000|20110128224109.000|TR0|Many of the police stations in this city, 
20110128224109.000|20110128224111.000|TR0|Alexandria, have been destroyed through 
20110128224111.000|20110128224113.000|TR0|the day, we've been told.  We haven't seen 
20110128224113.000|20110128224116.000|TR0|them all ourselves, but that's what local 
20110128224116.000|20110128224118.000|TR0|people are telling us here.
20110128224118.000|20110128224120.000|TR0|
20110128224120.000|20110128224123.000|TR0|This is a very big challenge and a very 
20110128224123.000|20110128224125.000|TR0|dangerous one now, to pit the army against 
20110128224125.000|20110128224127.000|TR0|the people.  Which side will the army go?  
20110128224127.000|20110128224130.000|TR0|We saw the police step back from that 
20110128224130.000|20110128224132.000|TR0|challenge today, chased off the streets, a 
20110128224132.000|20110128224134.000|TR0|power vacuum.  It's a very dangerous 
20110128224134.000|20110128224137.000|TR0|situation we enter tomorrow -- Wolf.
20110128224137.000|20110128224139.000|TR0|
20110128224139.000|20110128224141.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is that curfew in Alexandria, 
20110128224141.000|20110128224144.000|TR0|now approaching 1:00 a.m. over there, is 
20110128224144.000|20110128224146.000|TR0|that curfew holding?  Are people off the 
20110128224146.000|20110128224148.000|TR0|streets, Nic, or are people defying the 
20110128224148.000|20110128224151.000|TR0|order for a curfew?
20110128224151.000|20110128224153.000|TR0|
20110128224153.000|20110128224155.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  I think people here really 
20110128224155.000|20110128224158.000|TR0|don't care about the curfew.  They -- when 
20110128224158.000|20110128224200.000|TR0|the army arrived, it was several hours 
20110128224200.000|20110128224202.000|TR0|after the curfew.  They were still out on 
20110128224202.000|20110128224205.000|TR0|the streets here in the thousands. And 
20110128224205.000|20110128224207.000|TR0|even many hours after the curfew, with the 
20110128224207.000|20110128224209.000|TR0|army in place, I saw families coming down, 
20110128224209.000|20110128224212.000|TR0|a middle-aged man and his wife and two 
20110128224212.000|20110128224214.000|TR0|young daughters and two young sons, just 
20110128224214.000|20110128224216.000|TR0|come to look at the army and see what they 
20110128224216.000|20110128224219.000|TR0|were doing.
20110128224219.000|20110128224221.000|TR0|
20110128224221.000|20110128224223.000|TR0|They were inquisitive.  They heard the 
20110128224223.000|20110128224226.000|TR0|army were out there to protect them, so 
20110128224226.000|20110128224228.000|TR0|people certainly don't feel that they have 
20110128224228.000|20110128224230.000|TR0|to oblige by a curfew.  There were several 
20110128224230.000|20110128224233.000|TR0|hours here where there wasn't any sense of 
20110128224233.000|20110128224235.000|TR0|security.
20110128224235.000|20110128224237.000|TR0|
20110128224237.000|20110128224240.000|TR0|Another man put it to me this way, Wolf.  
20110128224240.000|20110128224242.000|TR0|He said, "Look, with the police completely 
20110128224242.000|20110128224244.000|TR0|gone, many police stations destroyed, the 
20110128224244.000|20110128224247.000|TR0|police beaten off the streets, beaten into 
20110128224247.000|20110128224249.000|TR0|retreat, there's no one to provide 
20110128224249.000|20110128224251.000|TR0|security.  People can loot houses.  Common 
20110128224251.000|20110128224254.000|TR0|thugs, common criminals can do what they 
20110128224254.000|20110128224256.000|TR0|want to do."  He said, "The army is here 
20110128224256.000|20110128224258.000|TR0|to look after us."
20110128224258.000|20110128224301.000|TR0|
20110128224301.000|20110128224303.000|TR0|They will stop that happening.  They will 
20110128224303.000|20110128224305.000|TR0|keep security.
20110128224305.000|20110128224308.000|TR0|
20110128224308.000|20110128224310.000|TR0|So the army came on to the streets trusted 
20110128224310.000|20110128224312.000|TR0|by the people.  They certainly haven't 
20110128224312.000|20110128224315.000|TR0|scared the people off the streets.
20110128224315.000|20110128224317.000|TR0|
20110128224317.000|20110128224319.000|TR0|However, President Mubarak's speech is 
20110128224319.000|20110128224322.000|TR0|going to change all that, because their 
20110128224322.000|20110128224324.000|TR0|challenge is to get rid of the president.  
20110128224324.000|20110128224326.000|TR0|He's called the army on the streets.  The 
20110128224326.000|20110128224329.000|TR0|army are there.  That will be the 
20110128224329.000|20110128224331.000|TR0|challenge to all the demonstrators 
20110128224331.000|20110128224334.000|TR0|tomorrow, to remove the army as well as 
20110128224334.000|20110128224336.000|TR0|they did with the police force.
20110128224336.000|20110128224338.000|TR0|
20110128224338.000|20110128224341.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Hold on, Nic, because Fred 
20110128224341.000|20110128224343.000|TR0|Pleitgen -- you're in Alexandria, where 
20110128224343.000|20110128224345.000|TR0|there's been a lot of turmoil, obviously.  
20110128224345.000|20110128224348.000|TR0|Fred Pleitgen is in Cairo.  Look what's 
20110128224348.000|20110128224350.000|TR0|happening.  These are live pictures you're 
20110128224350.000|20110128224352.000|TR0|seeing outside the balcony where he is.
20110128224352.000|20110128224355.000|TR0|
20110128224355.000|20110128224357.000|TR0|It looks like the chanting is getting more 
20110128224357.000|20110128224359.000|TR0|intense, Fred.  Are more people showing up?
20110128224359.000|20110128224402.000|TR0|
20110128224402.000|20110128224404.000|TR0|(CHANTING)
20110128224404.000|20110128224406.000|TR0|
20110128224406.000|20110128224409.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Yes, there are people actually 
20110128224409.000|20110128224411.000|TR0|-- they seem to be conglomerating in front 
20110128224411.000|20110128224413.000|TR0|of our building here, chanting things.  
20110128224413.000|20110128224416.000|TR0|What we heard from them before is they 
20110128224416.000|20110128224418.000|TR0|were saying, "Get out!  Get out!  We don't 
20110128224418.000|20110128224420.000|TR0|want him!  We don't want him!"
20110128224420.000|20110128224423.000|TR0|
20110128224423.000|20110128224425.000|TR0|Then they were saying, "Gamal" -- which 
20110128224425.000|20110128224427.000|TR0|is, of course, Hosni Mubarak's son -- 
20110128224427.000|20110128224430.000|TR0|"tell your dad that we hate him!"  So, 
20110128224430.000|20110128224432.000|TR0|certainly also people calling on Hosni 
20110128224432.000|20110128224434.000|TR0|Mubarak to step down.  Clearly not very 
20110128224434.000|20110128224437.000|TR0|happy with what they heard in that speech 
20110128224437.000|20110128224439.000|TR0|just a couple of minutes ago.
20110128224439.000|20110128224441.000|TR0|
20110128224441.000|20110128224444.000|TR0|And it really is the same situation as 
20110128224444.000|20110128224446.000|TR0|with what Nic was just talking about, 
20110128224446.000|20110128224448.000|TR0|where people really just don't care about 
20110128224448.000|20110128224451.000|TR0|the curfew. I mean, it's not being 
20110128224451.000|20110128224453.000|TR0|enforced.
20110128224453.000|20110128224455.000|TR0|
20110128224455.000|20110128224458.000|TR0|As you can see there's cars on the street 
20110128224458.000|20110128224500.000|TR0|here, people chanting. And really, these 
20110128224500.000|20110128224502.000|TR0|are -- if you look at these people, Wolf, 
20110128224502.000|20110128224505.000|TR0|these are ordinary people.
20110128224505.000|20110128224507.000|TR0|
20110128224507.000|20110128224509.000|TR0|We saw, you know, fathers with their 
20110128224509.000|20110128224512.000|TR0|children.  We saw husbands and wives.  
20110128224512.000|20110128224514.000|TR0|These are not hard-core, violent 
20110128224514.000|20110128224516.000|TR0|demonstrators.  These are regular people, 
20110128224516.000|20110128224519.000|TR0|sort of a snapshot, if you will, of 
20110128224519.000|20110128224521.000|TR0|Egyptian society, a very broad part of 
20110128224521.000|20110128224523.000|TR0|Egyptian society that keeps coming here.
20110128224523.000|20110128224526.000|TR0|
20110128224526.000|20110128224528.000|TR0|Right now they started chanting in front 
20110128224528.000|20110128224530.000|TR0|of our building. There's even more people 
20110128224530.000|20110128224533.000|TR0|now coming down to in front of the 
20110128224533.000|20110128224535.000|TR0|Information Ministry.  So clearly that 
20110128224535.000|20110128224537.000|TR0|speech that we saw by Hosni Mubarak did 
20110128224537.000|20110128224540.000|TR0|more to incite more anger here than it 
20110128224540.000|20110128224542.000|TR0|would have to calm people down.
20110128224542.000|20110128224544.000|TR0|
20110128224544.000|20110128224547.000|TR0|And I think a lot of people -- you know, 
20110128224547.000|20110128224549.000|TR0|Egyptians that we've been talking to, who 
20110128224549.000|20110128224551.000|TR0|heard that speech, said they simply 
20110128224551.000|20110128224554.000|TR0|couldn't believe what was going on, that 
20110128224554.000|20110128224556.000|TR0|they felt that Hosni Mubarak clearly 
20110128224556.000|20110128224558.000|TR0|didn't know what the situation was on the 
20110128224558.000|20110128224601.000|TR0|streets, didn't know what the people 
20110128224601.000|20110128224603.000|TR0|really wanted, and was clearly living in a 
20110128224603.000|20110128224605.000|TR0|world of his own, if you will -- Wolf.
20110128224605.000|20110128224608.000|TR0|
20110128224608.000|20110128224610.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is there any evidence that 
20110128224610.000|20110128224612.000|TR0|police or military are anywhere near these 
20110128224612.000|20110128224615.000|TR0|protesters, Fred?
20110128224615.000|20110128224617.000|TR0|
20110128224617.000|20110128224620.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Well, the military is.  The 
20110128224620.000|20110128224622.000|TR0|military is really stationary, surrounding 
20110128224622.000|20110128224624.000|TR0|the Information Ministry.  The military is 
20110128224624.000|20110128224627.000|TR0|shielding installations; however, it's not 
20110128224627.000|20110128224629.000|TR0|stopping people from protesting or doing 
20110128224629.000|20110128224631.000|TR0|anything.
20110128224631.000|20110128224634.000|TR0|
20110128224634.000|20110128224636.000|TR0|Right now you can see down here there's 
20110128224636.000|20110128224638.000|TR0|people chanting.  The police, for their 
20110128224638.000|20110128224641.000|TR0|part, Wolf, have absolutely and completely 
20110128224641.000|20110128224643.000|TR0|disappeared off the streets.
20110128224643.000|20110128224645.000|TR0|
20110128224645.000|20110128224648.000|TR0|Now, we do have to say the police, more 
20110128224648.000|20110128224650.000|TR0|than stopping the protests, they were 
20110128224650.000|20110128224652.000|TR0|really inciting even more anger.  That's 
20110128224652.000|20110128224655.000|TR0|because they are so unpopular.  The people 
20110128224655.000|20110128224657.000|TR0|hate the police force so much because 
20110128224657.000|20110128224659.000|TR0|there is so much police brutality here in 
20110128224659.000|20110128224702.000|TR0|this country.
20110128224702.000|20110128224704.000|TR0|
20110128224704.000|20110128224706.000|TR0|You can see more and more people coming 
20110128224706.000|20110128224709.000|TR0|here, honking their horns, chanting.  
20110128224709.000|20110128224711.000|TR0|There's more people down the street.
20110128224711.000|20110128224713.000|TR0|
20110128224713.000|20110128224716.000|TR0|So the military is shielding key 
20110128224716.000|20110128224718.000|TR0|installations, like, for instance, the 
20110128224718.000|20110128224720.000|TR0|Egyptian Museum, also, but also like the 
20110128224720.000|20110128224723.000|TR0|Information Ministry, to stop those from 
20110128224723.000|20110128224725.000|TR0|being taken over and from being destroyed. 
20110128224725.000|20110128224727.000|TR0| But they are not stopping people from 
20110128224727.000|20110128224730.000|TR0|going out here in the streets, they're not 
20110128224730.000|20110128224732.000|TR0|in any way enforcing a curfew here on 
20110128224732.000|20110128224734.000|TR0|these people.  So, really, they are not 
20110128224734.000|20110128224737.000|TR0|doing anything to stop the political 
20110128224737.000|20110128224739.000|TR0|momentum that these demonstrations have 
20110128224739.000|20110128224741.000|TR0|--Wolf.
20110128224741.000|20110128224744.000|TR0|
20110128224744.000|20110128224746.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Fred, hold on a second.  I want 
20110128224746.000|20110128224748.000|TR0|to go back to Nic Robertson.  He's in 
20110128224748.000|20110128224751.000|TR0|Alexandria for us.
20110128224751.000|20110128224753.000|TR0|
20110128224753.000|20110128224755.000|TR0|Nic, it sounds like what's happening in 
20110128224755.000|20110128224758.000|TR0|Cairo is very similar to what's happening 
20110128224758.000|20110128224800.000|TR0|in Alexandria, where you are.  The police 
20110128224800.000|20110128224802.000|TR0|have basically disappeared.  There's a 
20110128224802.000|20110128224805.000|TR0|military presence, but people are still -- 
20110128224805.000|20110128224807.000|TR0|have been in fact mobilized by the speech 
20110128224807.000|20110128224809.000|TR0|that President Mubarak gave, and, if 
20110128224809.000|20110128224812.000|TR0|anything, it's even making matters more 
20110128224812.000|20110128224814.000|TR0|intense.
20110128224814.000|20110128224816.000|TR0|
20110128224816.000|20110128224819.000|TR0|But go ahead and give me your assessment.
20110128224819.000|20110128224821.000|TR0|
20110128224821.000|20110128224823.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  I have yet to go outside on 
20110128224823.000|20110128224826.000|TR0|the streets and check.  A part of our team 
20110128224826.000|20110128224828.000|TR0|are out there looking right now.  I hope 
20110128224828.000|20110128224830.000|TR0|to hear back from them.
20110128224830.000|20110128224833.000|TR0|
20110128224833.000|20110128224835.000|TR0|But what Fred has been talking about in 
20110128224835.000|20110128224837.000|TR0|Cairo is absolutely reflected here.  When 
20110128224837.000|20110128224840.000|TR0|he talked about the demonstrators opening 
20110128224840.000|20110128224842.000|TR0|up to let the civilian traffic go through, 
20110128224842.000|20110128224844.000|TR0|yet smashing the police vehicles and 
20110128224844.000|20110128224847.000|TR0|burning the police vehicles, that's the 
20110128224847.000|20110128224849.000|TR0|newer image of what we've seen here in 
20110128224849.000|20110128224851.000|TR0|Alexandria as well, a crowd that knows the 
20110128224851.000|20110128224854.000|TR0|limits of what it wants to do, a challenge 
20110128224854.000|20110128224856.000|TR0|to the security institutions of the 
20110128224856.000|20110128224859.000|TR0|country.
20110128224859.000|20110128224901.000|TR0|
20110128224901.000|20110128224903.000|TR0|Again, to come back to the army, who are 
20110128224903.000|20110128224906.000|TR0|on the street corners here, if they are 
20110128224906.000|20110128224908.000|TR0|going to be enforcing the writ of 
20110128224908.000|20110128224910.000|TR0|President Mubarak, as will appear to be 
20110128224910.000|20110128224913.000|TR0|the case, because President Mubarak is not 
20110128224913.000|20110128224915.000|TR0|backing down, that is going to raise a 
20110128224915.000|20110128224917.000|TR0|challenge.  And I think you can expect to 
20110128224917.000|20110128224920.000|TR0|see here in Alexandria, as you are seeing 
20110128224920.000|20110128224922.000|TR0|in Cairo, more people coming back out on 
20110128224922.000|20110128224924.000|TR0|the streets, galvanized by the speech.
20110128224924.000|20110128224927.000|TR0|
20110128224927.000|20110128224929.000|TR0|I mean, when you're not here, it's hard to 
20110128224929.000|20110128224931.000|TR0|imagine, but people have been absolutely 
20110128224931.000|20110128224934.000|TR0|living, if you will, on the edge of their 
20110128224934.000|20110128224936.000|TR0|chairs. Not just the tens of thousands on 
20110128224936.000|20110128224938.000|TR0|the streets, the millions who are sitting 
20110128224938.000|20110128224941.000|TR0|in their homes, waiting to see what 
20110128224941.000|20110128224943.000|TR0|President Mubarak is going to do.
20110128224943.000|20110128224945.000|TR0|
20110128224945.000|20110128224948.000|TR0|They have never seen anything like what's 
20110128224948.000|20110128224950.000|TR0|happening today, never imagined in their 
20110128224950.000|20110128224952.000|TR0|wildest dreams, and they want this man 
20110128224952.000|20110128224955.000|TR0|gone.  And they have been sitting there 
20110128224955.000|20110128224957.000|TR0|waiting to see if the next announcement 
20110128224957.000|20110128224959.000|TR0|coming on state television was going to be 
20110128224959.000|20110128225002.000|TR0|him stepping down or he was truly leaving 
20110128225002.000|20110128225004.000|TR0|the country.
20110128225004.000|20110128225006.000|TR0|
20110128225006.000|20110128225009.000|TR0|And what have they seen?  As far as they 
20110128225009.000|20110128225011.000|TR0|can see, he's tried to dodge the 
20110128225011.000|20110128225013.000|TR0|responsibility, fire his government, talk 
20110128225013.000|20110128225016.000|TR0|in the way that was talked in the past 
20110128225016.000|20110128225018.000|TR0|about understanding the people's plight, 
20110128225018.000|20110128225020.000|TR0|helping them with their economy, helping 
20110128225020.000|20110128225023.000|TR0|their social situation, looking after the 
20110128225023.000|20110128225025.000|TR0|poor.
20110128225025.000|20110128225027.000|TR0|
20110128225027.000|20110128225030.000|TR0|They have heard it all before.  They don't 
20110128225030.000|20110128225032.000|TR0|believe it.  So this is a country that was 
20110128225032.000|20110128225034.000|TR0|expecting something else.
20110128225034.000|20110128225037.000|TR0|
20110128225037.000|20110128225039.000|TR0|It's a huge amount of excitement and 
20110128225039.000|20110128225041.000|TR0|expectation.  This will be a huge 
20110128225041.000|20110128225044.000|TR0|disappointment, and it will motivate 
20110128225044.000|20110128225046.000|TR0|people back out on the streets again 
20110128225046.000|20110128225048.000|TR0|tonight, and very likely again, as we've 
20110128225048.000|20110128225051.000|TR0|heard people tell us, through the days to 
20110128225051.000|20110128225053.000|TR0|come -- Wolf.
20110128225053.000|20110128225055.000|TR0|
20110128225055.000|20110128225058.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, Nic.  Don't go away.
20110128225058.000|20110128225100.000|TR0|
20110128225100.000|20110128225102.000|TR0|Nic is in Alexandria.  We're going to get 
20110128225102.000|20110128225105.000|TR0|a report on what's happening there.
20110128225105.000|20110128225107.000|TR0|
20110128225107.000|20110128225109.000|TR0|It's approaching 1:00 a.m. in Egypt right 
20110128225109.000|20110128225112.000|TR0|now.
20110128225112.000|20110128225114.000|TR0|
20110128225114.000|20110128225116.000|TR0|Fred Pleitgen is in Cairo.  We've got our 
20110128225116.000|20110128225119.000|TR0|other reporters on the scene as well.
20110128225119.000|20110128225121.000|TR0|
20110128225121.000|20110128225123.000|TR0|We're also going to check in on what's 
20110128225123.000|20110128225126.000|TR0|going on in Israel right now.  Israel and 
20110128225126.000|20110128225128.000|TR0|Egypt have had a peace treaty since 1979.  
20110128225128.000|20110128225130.000|TR0|Will that peace treaty be a casualty of 
20110128225130.000|20110128225133.000|TR0|what's going on right now?
20110128225133.000|20110128225135.000|TR0|
20110128225135.000|20110128225137.000|TR0|We'll check in with our correspondents in 
20110128225137.000|20110128225140.000|TR0|Israel as well.  We'll go the White House.
20110128225140.000|20110128225142.000|TR0|
20110128225142.000|20110128225145.000|TR0|Much more of the breaking news coverage.  
20110128225145.000|20110128225147.000|TR0|History unfolding live, right here in THE 
20110128225147.000|20110128225149.000|TR0|SITUATION ROOM.
20110128225149.000|20110128225152.000|TR0|
20110128225152.000|20110128225154.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110128225154.000|20110128225156.000|TR0|
20110128225156.000|20110128225159.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  Just to reset for a 
20110128225159.000|20110128225201.000|TR0|moment, we just heard the Egyptian 
20110128225201.000|20110128225203.000|TR0|president defiantly say he's in charge.  
20110128225203.000|20110128225206.000|TR0|He's asked the government to resign, but 
20110128225206.000|20110128225208.000|TR0|he is staying in power.  He will create a 
20110128225208.000|20110128225210.000|TR0|new government.  Tomorrow he says there's 
20110128225210.000|20110128225213.000|TR0|no doubt, though, that, as of right now, 
20110128225213.000|20110128225215.000|TR0|the situation is very, very tense in Egypt.
20110128225215.000|20110128225217.000|TR0|
20110128225217.000|20110128225220.000|TR0|No one is watching this more closely than 
20110128225220.000|20110128225222.000|TR0|Egypt's neighbor in Israel, where the 
20110128225222.000|20110128225224.000|TR0|stakes are enormous for what's going on.
20110128225224.000|20110128225227.000|TR0|
20110128225227.000|20110128225229.000|TR0|Kevin Flower is our Jerusalem bureau chief.
20110128225229.000|20110128225231.000|TR0|
20110128225231.000|20110128225234.000|TR0|What are the Israelis saying, the 
20110128225234.000|20110128225236.000|TR0|government of Prime Minister Netanyahu?  
20110128225236.000|20110128225238.000|TR0|Because at stake right now is this peace 
20110128225238.000|20110128225241.000|TR0|treaty between Israel and Egypt which was 
20110128225241.000|20110128225243.000|TR0|signed back in 1979.
20110128225243.000|20110128225245.000|TR0|
20110128225245.000|20110128225248.000|TR0|KEVIN FLOWER, CNN JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF:  
20110128225248.000|20110128225250.000|TR0|Well, that's right, Wolf.  But the silence 
20110128225250.000|20110128225252.000|TR0|right now from Jerusalem is deafening.  We 
20110128225252.000|20110128225255.000|TR0|are hearing nothing officially from the 
20110128225255.000|20110128225257.000|TR0|Israeli prime minister's office, from the 
20110128225257.000|20110128225259.000|TR0|foreign ministry.
20110128225259.000|20110128225302.000|TR0|
20110128225302.000|20110128225304.000|TR0|Rest assured that all government officials 
20110128225304.000|20110128225306.000|TR0|are watching these events in Egypt, in 
20110128225306.000|20110128225309.000|TR0|Cairo, very closely.  But no official 
20110128225309.000|20110128225311.000|TR0|reaction at this point.
20110128225311.000|20110128225313.000|TR0|
20110128225313.000|20110128225316.000|TR0|And as you said, this relationship between 
20110128225316.000|20110128225318.000|TR0|Israel and Egypt is a very, very important 
20110128225318.000|20110128225320.000|TR0|to Israel.  Egypt is its most important 
20110128225320.000|20110128225323.000|TR0|ally in the region.
20110128225323.000|20110128225325.000|TR0|
20110128225325.000|20110128225327.000|TR0|They signed that peace deal 30 years ago.  
20110128225327.000|20110128225330.000|TR0|And while a lot of people describe this as 
20110128225330.000|20110128225332.000|TR0|a cold peace between the two countries, 
20110128225332.000|20110128225334.000|TR0|the fact is, is that there is a lot of 
20110128225334.000|20110128225337.000|TR0|security cooperation that goes on.
20110128225337.000|20110128225339.000|TR0|
20110128225339.000|20110128225341.000|TR0|Egypt has been a primary factor, a 
20110128225341.000|20110128225344.000|TR0|facilitator in trying to get talks with 
20110128225344.000|20110128225346.000|TR0|the Palestinians started over the course 
20110128225346.000|20110128225348.000|TR0|of the years, trying to make that process 
20110128225348.000|20110128225351.000|TR0|successful.  So Israeli officials are 
20110128225351.000|20110128225353.000|TR0|going to be looking at all of this with 
20110128225353.000|20110128225355.000|TR0|great concern, and more concern tonight 
20110128225355.000|20110128225358.000|TR0|after that speech from Hosni Mubarak, as 
20110128225358.000|20110128225400.000|TR0|to just which direction this is going to 
20110128225400.000|20110128225402.000|TR0|go.
20110128225402.000|20110128225405.000|TR0|
20110128225405.000|20110128225407.000|TR0|They do not want to see a regime change in 
20110128225407.000|20110128225409.000|TR0|Egypt.  Israel does not want to see a 
20110128225409.000|20110128225412.000|TR0|revolution take place on its southern 
20110128225412.000|20110128225414.000|TR0|border, in the most important country in

20110128225419.000|20110128225421.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Because as they say, and they've 
20110128225421.000|20110128225424.000|TR0|said for many, many years in describing 
20110128225424.000|20110128225426.000|TR0|that relationship between Israel and 
20110128225426.000|20110128225428.000|TR0|Egypt, it may be a cold peace, but that's 
20110128225428.000|20110128225431.000|TR0|certainly a lot better than a hot war, 
20110128225431.000|20110128225433.000|TR0|especially when you consider the fact 
20110128225433.000|20110128225435.000|TR0|there are 80 million people in Egypt, a 
20110128225435.000|20110128225438.000|TR0|huge military, potentially an enormous 
20110128225438.000|20110128225440.000|TR0|threat to Israel, if in fact they abandon 
20110128225440.000|20110128225442.000|TR0|the peace treaty and move in different 
20110128225442.000|20110128225445.000|TR0|direction, if the next government, whoever 
20110128225445.000|20110128225447.000|TR0|were to take over after Mubarak, assuming 
20110128225447.000|20110128225449.000|TR0|someone else takes over, he doesn't remain 
20110128225449.000|20110128225452.000|TR0|in power, the stakes for Israeli would be 
20110128225452.000|20110128225454.000|TR0|enormous.
20110128225454.000|20110128225456.000|TR0|
20110128225456.000|20110128225459.000|TR0|I assume the government, the prime 
20110128225459.000|20110128225501.000|TR0|minister in Israel, told everyone just 
20110128225501.000|20110128225503.000|TR0|shut up right now, because they're afraid 
20110128225503.000|20110128225506.000|TR0|anything Israel might say could make the 
20110128225506.000|20110128225508.000|TR0|situation, as bad as it is for Israel 
20110128225508.000|20110128225510.000|TR0|right now, even worse.  Is that right?
20110128225510.000|20110128225513.000|TR0|
20110128225513.000|20110128225515.000|TR0|FLOWER:  That's absolutely right.  And 
20110128225515.000|20110128225517.000|TR0|this happens on occasion for extremely 
20110128225517.000|20110128225520.000|TR0|sensitive issues, but this is a huge issue 
20110128225520.000|20110128225522.000|TR0|for Israel.
20110128225522.000|20110128225524.000|TR0|
20110128225524.000|20110128225527.000|TR0|The prime minister's office, the prime 
20110128225527.000|20110128225529.000|TR0|minister directing ministers not to say 
20110128225529.000|20110128225531.000|TR0|anything publicly.  It will be interesting 
20110128225531.000|20110128225534.000|TR0|to see if that holds, because Israeli 
20110128225534.000|20110128225536.000|TR0|ministers are not known for biting their 
20110128225536.000|20110128225538.000|TR0|-- keeping their tongue all the time.  But 
20110128225538.000|20110128225541.000|TR0|we are into the Friday/Saturday Sabbath, 
20110128225541.000|20110128225543.000|TR0|so likely that we will hear something 
20110128225543.000|20110128225545.000|TR0|officially from this government at the end 
20110128225545.000|20110128225548.000|TR0|of the day tomorrow, but quite possible 
20110128225548.000|20110128225550.000|TR0|we'll hear from some ministers or some 
20110128225550.000|20110128225552.000|TR0|officials tomorrow in some capacity --

20110128225639.000|20110128225641.000|TR0|BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, the 
20110128225641.000|20110128225644.000|TR0|spirit of civil protest not confined to 
20110128225644.000|20110128225646.000|TR0|the Egyptian street.  You have a group of 
20110128225646.000|20110128225648.000|TR0|Egyptian- Americans here in front of the 
20110128225648.000|20110128225651.000|TR0|White House chanting that Mubarak -- that 
20110128225651.000|20110128225653.000|TR0|he must go.  They're trying to bring their 
20110128225653.000|20110128225655.000|TR0|own pressure to bear on the Obama 
20110128225655.000|20110128225658.000|TR0|administration to ratchet up its own 
20110128225658.000|20110128225700.000|TR0|pressure on President Mubarak in Egypt.
20110128225700.000|20110128225702.000|TR0|
20110128225702.000|20110128225705.000|TR0|I'm joined by Mr. Saad Ibrahim.  Mr. 
20110128225705.000|20110128225707.000|TR0|Ibrahim was imprisoned three times, he 
20110128225707.000|20110128225710.000|TR0|says, by the Mubarak regime over the last 
20110128225710.000|20110128225712.000|TR0|several years.  He is now a professor at 
20110128225712.000|20110128225714.000|TR0|Drew University.
20110128225714.000|20110128225717.000|TR0|

20110128225721.000|20110128225724.000|TR0|Mubarak to reform, to embrace reform.  Is 
20110128225724.000|20110128225726.000|TR0|that enough for you?

20110128225728.000|20110128225731.000|TR0|PROF. SAAD IBRAHIM, DREW UNIVERSITY:  Of

20110128225733.000|20110128225735.000|TR0|late and too late (ph).  I think now they 
20110128225735.000|20110128225738.000|TR0|should probably ask him to leave 
20110128225738.000|20110128225740.000|TR0|peacefully as Ben Ali left Tunisia, and 
20110128225740.000|20110128225742.000|TR0|let the different people determine their

20110128225752.000|20110128225754.000|TR0|IBRAHIM:  They have many qualified people 
20110128225754.000|20110128225756.000|TR0|who can take over.
20110128225756.000|20110128225759.000|TR0|
20110128225759.000|20110128225801.000|TR0|TODD:  I want to ask about that.  There is 
20110128225801.000|20110128225803.000|TR0|a question as to if not Mubarak, who else? 
20110128225803.000|20110128225806.000|TR0| Who fills that void?
20110128225806.000|20110128225808.000|TR0|
20110128225808.000|20110128225810.000|TR0|Mr. ElBaradei might be a bit of an 
20110128225810.000|20110128225813.000|TR0|unknown.  Is he the one to take over, do 
20110128225813.000|20110128225815.000|TR0|you think?  Or is there something or 
20110128225815.000|20110128225817.000|TR0|someone else who should fill Mubarak's 
20110128225817.000|20110128225820.000|TR0|place immediately?
20110128225820.000|20110128225822.000|TR0|
20110128225822.000|20110128225824.000|TR0|IBRAHIM:  We have institutional guards to 
20110128225824.000|20110128225827.000|TR0|fill in if the president is removed or if 
20110128225827.000|20110128225829.000|TR0|he dies.  And those institutional measures 
20110128225829.000|20110128225831.000|TR0|should be brought to bear.  And of course 
20110128225831.000|20110128225834.000|TR0|we have hundreds of qualified Egyptians.  
20110128225834.000|20110128225836.000|TR0|And if you know ElBaradei's name, he's one 
20110128225836.000|20110128225838.000|TR0|of several.
20110128225838.000|20110128225841.000|TR0|

20110128225859.000|20110128225902.000|TR0|So a lot of Egyptian-Americans here 
20110128225902.000|20110128225904.000|TR0|voicing solidarity with the protesters in 
20110128225904.000|20110128225906.000|TR0|Egypt.  We had one young lady tell us that 
20110128225906.000|20110128225909.000|TR0|there's not only a concern here for what's 
20110128225909.000|20110128225911.000|TR0|going on there socially and politically, 
20110128225911.000|20110128225913.000|TR0|but there are people here legitimately 
20110128225913.000|20110128225916.000|TR0|worried about their loved ones.

20110128225923.000|20110128225925.000|TR0|way or not.  As you know, social media and 
20110128225925.000|20110128225927.000|TR0|other forms of communication have been cut 
20110128225927.000|20110128225930.000|TR0|off there.  So, in addition to some 
20110128225930.000|20110128225932.000|TR0|political concerns here among this crowd, 
20110128225932.000|20110128225934.000|TR0|some real personal and family concerns as
