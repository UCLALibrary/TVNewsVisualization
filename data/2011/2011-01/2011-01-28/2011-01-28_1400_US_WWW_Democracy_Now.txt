20110128141506.044|20110128141507.879|TR0|services have also reported that 
20110128141507.879|20110128141509.713|TR0|1,000 activists were arrested 
20110128141509.713|20110128141511.548|TR0|last night, and 149 have been 
20110128141511.548|20110128141513.382|TR0|charged with attempting to 
20110128141513.382|20110128141515.216|TR0|overthrow the government. 
20110128141515.216|20110128141517.051|TR0|Egyptian authorities have also 
20110128141517.051|20110128141518.885|TR0|arrested 20 members of the 
20110128141518.885|20110128141520.720|TR0|Muslim Brotherhood, including 
20110128141520.720|20110128141522.554|TR0|two of its most senior members.

20110128141524.389|20110128141526.223|TR0|For the past three days, cities 
20110128141526.223|20110128141528.058|TR0|across Egypt have witnessed 
20110128141528.058|20110128141529.892|TR0|unprecedented protests against 
20110128141529.892|20110128141531.727|TR0|the 30-year rule of President 
20110128141531.727|20110128141533.561|TR0|Hosni Mubarak. At least seven 
20110128141533.561|20110128141535.396|TR0|people have died and up to 1,200 
20110128141535.396|20110128141537.230|TR0|have been arrested since the 
20110128141537.230|20110128141539.064|TR0|protests began. Human Rights 
20110128141539.064|20110128141540.899|TR0|Watch said Egyptian police have 
20110128141540.899|20110128141542.733|TR0|escalated the use of force 
20110128141542.733|20110128141544.568|TR0|against largely peaceful 
20110128141544.568|20110128141546.402|TR0|demonstrations, calling it, 
20110128141546.402|20110128141548.237|TR0|quote, "wholly unacceptable and 
20110128141548.237|20110128141550.071|TR0|disproportionate."
20110128141550.071|20110128141551.906|TR0|
20110128141551.906|20110128141553.740|TR0|We go now to Cairo, where we're 
20110128141553.740|20110128141555.575|TR0|joined on the line by Ahmad 
20110128141555.575|20110128141557.409|TR0|Shokr. He's an editor at the 
20110128141557.409|20110128141559.244|TR0|Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry 
20110128141559.244|20110128141601.078|TR0|Al-Youm. It's very difficult to 
20110128141601.078|20110128141602.912|TR0|get through to Cairo right now. 
20110128141602.912|20110128141604.747|TR0|He's joining us from a hotel in 
20110128141604.747|20110128141606.581|TR0|downtown Cairo near Tahrir 
20110128141606.581|20110128141608.416|TR0|Square.
20110128141608.416|20110128141610.250|TR0|
20110128141610.250|20110128141612.085|TR0|Ahmad Shokr, thank you for 
20110128141612.085|20110128141613.919|TR0|joining us. Can you describe 
20110128141613.919|20110128141615.754|TR0|what is happening right now in 
20110128141615.754|20110128141617.588|TR0|Cairo?
20110128141617.588|20110128141619.423|TR0|
20110128141619.423|20110128141621.257|TR0|>> AHMAD SHOKR: Thank you. I'm 
20110128141621.257|20110128141623.092|TR0|glad to be here.
20110128141623.092|20110128141624.926|TR0|
20110128141624.926|20110128141626.760|TR0|Well, the scenes right now are 
20110128141626.760|20110128141628.595|TR0|quite remarkable. Literally, 
20110128141628.595|20110128141630.429|TR0|tens of thousands are taking to 
20110128141630.429|20110128141632.264|TR0|the streets amidst a huge 
20110128141632.264|20110128141634.098|TR0|security presence. I'm standing 
20110128141634.098|20110128141635.933|TR0|in front of a demonstration of 
20110128141635.933|20110128141637.767|TR0|at least a few thousand people 
20110128141637.767|20110128141639.602|TR0|who have taken over one of the 
20110128141639.602|20110128141641.436|TR0|main bridges in Cairo, calling 
20110128141641.436|20110128141643.271|TR0|for the ouster of Hosni 
20110128141643.271|20110128141645.105|TR0|Mubarak's regime. They have 
20110128141645.105|20110128141646.940|TR0|raised their hands, stating that 
20110128141646.940|20110128141648.774|TR0|they're peaceful protesters, but 
20110128141648.774|20110128141650.608|TR0|have been met by a shower of 
20110128141650.608|20110128141652.443|TR0|rubber bullets and tear gas.
20110128141652.443|20110128141654.277|TR0|
20110128141654.277|20110128141656.112|TR0|This is the scene in many 
20110128141656.112|20110128141657.946|TR0|different parts of the capital 
20110128141657.946|20110128141659.781|TR0|today, and this is happening in 
20110128141659.781|20110128141701.615|TR0|several Egyptian cities, as we 
20110128141701.615|20110128141703.450|TR0|speak. There were major 
20110128141703.450|20110128141705.284|TR0|demonstrations planned to take 
20110128141705.284|20110128141707.119|TR0|place after Friday noon prayers 
20110128141707.119|20110128141708.953|TR0|today. And most major mosques in 
20110128141708.953|20110128141710.788|TR0|Cairo have been shut down by the 
20110128141710.788|20110128141712.622|TR0|government. Tahrir Square, which 
20110128141712.622|20110128141714.456|TR0|was the site of a very large 
20110128141714.456|20110128141716.291|TR0|demonstration on Tuesday of 
20110128141716.291|20110128141718.125|TR0|about 15,000 people, has been 
20110128141718.125|20110128141719.960|TR0|completely blocked off by 
20110128141719.960|20110128141721.794|TR0|security forces.
20110128141721.794|20110128141723.629|TR0|
20110128141723.629|20110128141725.463|TR0|Egyptians woke up today to find 
20110128141725.463|20110128141727.298|TR0|that their internet and mobile 
20110128141727.298|20110128141729.132|TR0|and SMS services have been 
20110128141729.132|20110128141730.967|TR0|blocked, as well. And so, Egypt 
20110128141730.967|20110128141732.801|TR0|is effectively disconnected from 
20110128141732.801|20110128141734.636|TR0|the digital world right now, in 
20110128141734.636|20110128141736.470|TR0|an attempt by the government to 
20110128141736.470|20110128141738.304|TR0|prevent communication about the 
20110128141738.304|20110128141740.139|TR0|protests. Vodafone, one of the 
20110128141740.139|20110128141741.973|TR0|three mobile service companies 
20110128141741.973|20110128141743.808|TR0|in Egypt, has reportedly 
20110128141743.808|20110128141745.642|TR0|confirmed that this was done 
20110128141745.642|20110128141747.477|TR0|under orders of Egyptian 
20110128141747.477|20110128141749.311|TR0|authorities.
20110128141749.311|20110128141751.146|TR0|
20110128141751.146|20110128141752.980|TR0|And so, protesters are, like I 
20110128141752.980|20110128141754.815|TR0|said, now all over the country 
20110128141754.815|20110128141756.649|TR0|on the streets. They're being 
20110128141756.649|20110128141758.483|TR0|violently dispersed with tear 
20110128141758.483|20110128141800.318|TR0|gas, and they're facing off with 
20110128141800.318|20110128141802.152|TR0|thousands of Central Security 
20110128141802.152|20110128141803.987|TR0|police. There's reports that 
20110128141803.987|20110128141805.821|TR0|journalists have been attacked. 
20110128141805.821|20110128141807.656|TR0|Al Jazeera has reported an 
20110128141807.656|20110128141809.490|TR0|attack on one of its own 
20110128141809.490|20110128141811.325|TR0|journalists. A BBC correspondent 
20110128141811.325|20110128141813.159|TR0|apparently has been injured.
20110128141813.159|20110128141814.994|TR0|
20110128141814.994|20110128141816.828|TR0|Reform advocate Mohamed 
20110128141816.828|20110128141818.663|TR0|ElBaradei, the former head of 
20110128141818.663|20110128141820.497|TR0|the International Atomic Energy 
20110128141820.497|20110128141822.331|TR0|Agency, has reportedly been 
20110128141822.331|20110128141824.166|TR0|surrounded at a mosque, where he 
20110128141824.166|20110128141826.000|TR0|intended to pray and then lead a 
20110128141826.000|20110128141827.835|TR0|march afterwards. There were 
20110128141827.835|20110128141829.669|TR0|reports earlier that he has been 
20110128141829.669|20110128141831.504|TR0|arrested, but as far as I 
20110128141831.504|20110128141833.338|TR0|understand right now, he has 
20110128141833.338|20110128141835.173|TR0|just been surrounded by security 
20110128141835.173|20110128141837.007|TR0|and prevented from - of course, 
20110128141837.007|20110128141838.842|TR0|Baradei has been encouraging 
20110128141838.842|20110128141840.676|TR0|people to take to the streets. I 
20110128141840.676|20110128141842.511|TR0|an interview with The Guardian 
20110128141842.511|20110128141844.345|TR0|yesterday, he stated that the 
20110128141844.345|20110128141846.179|TR0|regime is on its last legs - 
20110128141846.179|20110128141848.014|TR0|again, very, very strong words 
20110128141848.014|20110128141849.848|TR0|from the reform advocate, 
20110128141849.848|20110128141851.683|TR0|stronger than we've heard from 
20110128141851.683|20110128141853.517|TR0|him in the past few months.
20110128141853.517|20110128141855.352|TR0|
20110128141855.352|20110128141857.186|TR0|So, the country is really in a 
20110128141857.186|20110128141859.021|TR0|state of upheaval amidst a 
20110128141859.021|20110128141900.855|TR0|massive security clampdown. And 
20110128141900.855|20110128141902.690|TR0|this is incredibly significant 
20110128141902.690|20110128141904.524|TR0|because these are the largest 
20110128141904.524|20110128141906.359|TR0|mass rallies that have happened 
20110128141906.359|20110128141908.193|TR0|in Egypt over the course of 
20110128141908.193|20110128141910.027|TR0|Mubarak's 30-year rule. This is 
20110128141910.027|20110128141911.862|TR0|definitely the largest, the 
20110128141911.862|20110128141913.696|TR0|biggest political challenge that 
20110128141913.696|20110128141915.531|TR0|the regime has yet to see from 
20110128141915.531|20110128141917.365|TR0|the streets.
20110128141917.365|20110128141919.200|TR0|
20110128141919.200|20110128141921.034|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Ahmad Shokr, I 
20110128141921.034|20110128141922.869|TR0|wanted to ask you about reports 
20110128141922.869|20110128141924.703|TR0|that CNN - well, listening to 
20110128141924.703|20110128141926.538|TR0|Ben Wedeman, he said his own 
20110128141926.538|20110128141928.372|TR0|camera was taken, was cracked by 
20110128141928.372|20110128141930.207|TR0|Egyptian forces, also possibly 
20110128141930.207|20110128141932.041|TR0|that as many as 20 people were 
20110128141932.041|20110128141933.875|TR0|killed in Suez. What reports do 
20110128141933.875|20110128141935.710|TR0|you have, and what is the 
20110128141935.710|20110128141937.544|TR0|significance of Suez in this 
20110128141937.544|20110128141939.379|TR0|mass protest in Egypt?
20110128141939.379|20110128141941.213|TR0|
20110128141941.213|20110128141943.048|TR0|>> AHMAD SHOKR: There have been 
20110128141943.048|20110128141944.882|TR0|violent clashes happening in 
20110128141944.882|20110128141946.717|TR0|Suez, perhaps more than any 
20110128141946.717|20110128141948.551|TR0|other city in the country for 
20110128141948.551|20110128141950.386|TR0|the past two days. The last 
20110128141950.386|20110128141952.220|TR0|reports I heard were that, I 
20110128141952.220|20110128141954.055|TR0|believe, five or six people had 
20110128141954.055|20110128141955.889|TR0|been killed, though it's been 
20110128141955.889|20110128141957.723|TR0|very difficult to get 
20110128141957.723|20110128141959.558|TR0|information today because of the 
20110128141959.558|20110128142001.392|TR0|clampdown on mobile phones and 
20110128142001.392|20110128142003.227|TR0|internet. So I don't know what 
20110128142003.227|20110128142005.061|TR0|the latest is out of Suez, but 
20110128142005.061|20110128142006.896|TR0|there definitely have been 
20110128142006.896|20110128142008.730|TR0|serious clashes happening in 
20110128142008.730|20110128142010.565|TR0|Suez for the past two days.
20110128142010.565|20110128142012.399|TR0|
20110128142012.399|20110128142014.234|TR0|And like I said, the response of 
20110128142014.234|20110128142016.068|TR0|the security has really been 
20110128142016.068|20110128142017.903|TR0|quite violent. I think on 
20110128142017.903|20110128142019.737|TR0|Tuesday, when the demonstrations 
20110128142019.737|20110128142021.571|TR0|started, there were a few hours 
20110128142021.571|20110128142023.406|TR0|of leniency in the beginning, 
20110128142023.406|20110128142025.240|TR0|perhaps to gauge how big these 
20110128142025.240|20110128142027.075|TR0|demonstrations actually would be 
20110128142027.075|20110128142028.909|TR0|and whether the tremendous 
20110128142028.909|20110128142030.744|TR0|amount of support that they 
20110128142030.744|20110128142032.578|TR0|received on Facebook would 
20110128142032.578|20110128142034.413|TR0|actually translate into bodies 
20110128142034.413|20110128142036.247|TR0|on the streets. But since 
20110128142036.247|20110128142038.082|TR0|Wednesday night, the response 
20110128142038.082|20110128142039.916|TR0|has been very violent. Police 
20110128142039.916|20110128142041.751|TR0|have been using tear gas and 
20110128142041.751|20110128142043.585|TR0|rubber bullets as a first 
20110128142043.585|20110128142045.419|TR0|resort. Many people that I know 
20110128142045.419|20110128142047.254|TR0|personally have been beaten, 
20110128142047.254|20110128142049.088|TR0|have been detained. Over a 
20110128142049.088|20110128142050.923|TR0|thousand people have been 
20110128142050.923|20110128142052.757|TR0|detained. Journalists are being 
20110128142052.757|20110128142054.592|TR0|attacked. International 
20110128142054.592|20110128142056.426|TR0|organizations like Amnesty and 
20110128142056.426|20110128142058.261|TR0|Human Rights Watch have 
20110128142058.261|20110128142100.095|TR0|condemned what is going on. The 
20110128142100.095|20110128142101.930|TR0|Committee to Protect Journalists 
20110128142101.930|20110128142103.764|TR0|has condemned what is going on. 
20110128142103.764|20110128142105.599|TR0|And so, the situation right now 
20110128142105.599|20110128142107.433|TR0|is really quite violent.
20110128142107.433|20110128142109.267|TR0|
20110128142109.267|20110128142111.102|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: And 
20110128142111.102|20110128142112.936|TR0|Ahmad Shokr, there were reports 
20110128142112.936|20110128142114.771|TR0|on Arabic wire news services 
20110128142114.771|20110128142116.605|TR0|that the Egyptian forces had 
20110128142116.605|20110128142118.440|TR0|deployed special elite 
20110128142118.440|20110128142120.274|TR0|operations forces across key 
20110128142120.274|20110128142122.109|TR0|locations in Cairo and elsewhere 
20110128142122.109|20110128142123.943|TR0|and also that people were 
20110128142123.943|20110128142125.778|TR0|rounded up last night, including 
20110128142125.778|20110128142127.612|TR0|members of the Muslim 
20110128142127.612|20110128142129.447|TR0|Brotherhood. What have you heard?
20110128142129.447|20110128142131.281|TR0|
20110128142131.281|20110128142133.115|TR0|>> AHMAD SHOKR: Again, I've 
20110128142133.115|20110128142134.950|TR0|heard those same reports. It's 
20110128142134.950|20110128142136.784|TR0|difficult to get a very accurate 
20110128142136.784|20110128142138.619|TR0|sense of what's going on, again, 
20110128142138.619|20110128142140.453|TR0|because of the blockage of 
20110128142140.453|20110128142142.288|TR0|information. But I have 
20110128142142.288|20110128142144.122|TR0|certainly heard that leaders 
20110128142144.122|20110128142145.957|TR0|from the Muslim Brotherhood, 
20110128142145.957|20110128142147.791|TR0|which is effectively a banned 
20110128142147.791|20110128142149.626|TR0|political - banned, but 
20110128142149.626|20110128142151.460|TR0|tolerated, political 
20110128142151.460|20110128142153.295|TR0|organization in Egypt, which 
20110128142153.295|20110128142155.129|TR0|announced it would fully support 
20110128142155.129|20110128142156.963|TR0|the protests today. There are 
20110128142156.963|20110128142158.798|TR0|reports that their key leaders 
20110128142158.798|20110128142200.632|TR0|have been arrested in different 
20110128142200.632|20110128142202.467|TR0|parts of the country.
20110128142202.467|20110128142204.301|TR0|
20110128142204.301|20110128142206.136|TR0|And, I mean, the security 
20110128142206.136|20110128142207.970|TR0|presence right now in Cairo, 
20110128142207.970|20110128142209.805|TR0|where I am, is quite massive. 
20110128142209.805|20110128142211.639|TR0|There appear to be Central 
20110128142211.639|20110128142213.474|TR0|Security, and there does appear 
20110128142213.474|20110128142215.308|TR0|to be special forces, as well, 
20110128142215.308|20110128142217.142|TR0|although, like I said, it's 
20110128142217.142|20110128142218.977|TR0|difficult to confirm these 
20110128142218.977|20110128142220.811|TR0|reports. And as I'm speaking, 
20110128142220.811|20110128142222.646|TR0|there is actually a very violent 
20110128142222.646|20110128142224.480|TR0|clash that's happening right now 
20110128142224.480|20110128142226.315|TR0|between the protesters on the 
20110128142226.315|20110128142228.149|TR0|bridge, who are being showered 
20110128142228.149|20110128142229.984|TR0|with tear gas canisters - I 
20110128142229.984|20110128142231.818|TR0|mean, literally, looking out 
20110128142231.818|20110128142233.653|TR0|onto the city, you know, what 
20110128142233.653|20110128142235.487|TR0|one sees are just the clamoring 
20110128142235.487|20110128142237.322|TR0|protests all over different 
20110128142237.322|20110128142239.156|TR0|parts of the downtown core, 
20110128142239.156|20110128142240.990|TR0|covered with clouds and clouds 
20110128142240.990|20110128142242.825|TR0|of tear gas and black smoke.
20110128142242.825|20110128142244.659|TR0|
20110128142244.659|20110128142246.494|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Ahmad Shokr, can 
20110128142246.494|20110128142248.328|TR0|you explain what people in the 
20110128142248.328|20110128142250.163|TR0|streets, what are they calling 
20110128142250.163|20110128142251.997|TR0|for exactly?
20110128142251.997|20110128142253.832|TR0|
20110128142253.832|20110128142255.666|TR0|>> AHMAD SHOKR: Well, I mean, 
20110128142255.666|20110128142257.501|TR0|there's a variety of grievances 
20110128142257.501|20110128142259.335|TR0|that are being expressed in 
20110128142259.335|20110128142301.170|TR0|these protests. You know, people 
20110128142301.170|20110128142303.004|TR0|are fed up about a lot of 
20110128142303.004|20110128142304.838|TR0|things. People are fed up about 
20110128142304.838|20110128142306.673|TR0|the emergency law, the state of 
20110128142306.673|20110128142308.507|TR0|emergency that has prevailed in 
20110128142308.507|20110128142310.342|TR0|Egypt for the past 30 years. 
20110128142310.342|20110128142312.176|TR0|They're fed up with corruption. 
20110128142312.176|20110128142314.011|TR0|They're fed up with unemployment 
20110128142314.011|20110128142315.845|TR0|and with the deteriorating 
20110128142315.845|20110128142317.680|TR0|economic situation of the 
20110128142317.680|20110128142319.514|TR0|country. You know, people - 
20110128142319.514|20110128142321.349|TR0|there's been a movement in Egypt 
20110128142321.349|20110128142323.183|TR0|for the past couple of years to 
20110128142323.183|20110128142325.018|TR0|demand a national minimum wage, 
20110128142325.018|20110128142326.852|TR0|which currently sits at a 
20110128142326.852|20110128142328.686|TR0|pathetic 35 pounds a month, 
20110128142328.686|20110128142330.521|TR0|which is roughly the equivalent 
20110128142330.521|20110128142332.355|TR0|of seven or eight U.S. dollars. 
20110128142332.355|20110128142334.190|TR0|So there's a variety of 
20110128142334.190|20110128142336.024|TR0|grievances that are being 
20110128142336.024|20110128142337.859|TR0|brought to the streets. But 
20110128142337.859|20110128142339.693|TR0|gauging by people's chants and 
20110128142339.693|20110128142341.528|TR0|conversations with people on the 
20110128142341.528|20110128142343.362|TR0|street, the unifying - the 
20110128142343.362|20110128142345.197|TR0|unifying demand, the common 
20110128142345.197|20110128142347.031|TR0|demand that's being articulated 
20110128142347.031|20110128142348.866|TR0|right now, is that people want 
20110128142348.866|20110128142350.700|TR0|the regime ousted. I mean, 
20110128142350.700|20110128142352.534|TR0|that's sort of become the slogan 
20110128142352.534|20110128142354.369|TR0|of these protests over the past 
20110128142354.369|20110128142356.203|TR0|few days that people have been 
20110128142356.203|20110128142358.038|TR0|chanting over and over, that 
20110128142358.038|20110128142359.872|TR0|they want the regime ousted. 
20110128142359.872|20110128142401.707|TR0|They are fed up, and they want a 
20110128142401.707|20110128142403.541|TR0|new government.
20110128142403.541|20110128142405.376|TR0|
20110128142405.376|20110128142407.210|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Ahmad 
20110128142407.210|20110128142409.045|TR0|Shokr, what's very interesting 
20110128142409.045|20110128142410.879|TR0|also is that these protests are 
20110128142410.879|20110128142412.714|TR0|largely leaderless. Can you 
20110128142412.714|20110128142414.548|TR0|explain who is organizing the 
20110128142414.548|20110128142416.382|TR0|protests, why it began on 
20110128142416.382|20110128142418.217|TR0|January 25th, which is National 
20110128142418.217|20110128142420.051|TR0|Police Day, and who is really at 
20110128142420.051|20110128142421.886|TR0|the forefront of what's going 
20110128142421.886|20110128142423.720|TR0|on? Who are the people in the 
20110128142423.720|20110128142425.555|TR0|streets?
20110128142425.555|20110128142427.389|TR0|
20110128142427.389|20110128142429.224|TR0|>> AHMAD SHOKR: Well, the people 
20110128142429.224|20110128142431.058|TR0|who initiated the protest call 
20110128142431.058|20110128142432.893|TR0|are largely a group of youth 
20110128142432.893|20110128142434.727|TR0|activists that have been 
20110128142434.727|20110128142436.562|TR0|organizing through social media, 
20110128142436.562|20110128142438.396|TR0|mostly through Facebook. They 
20110128142438.396|20110128142440.230|TR0|started a Facebook page to call 
20110128142440.230|20110128142442.065|TR0|for this demonstration, which 
20110128142442.065|20110128142443.899|TR0|immediately received just an 
20110128142443.899|20110128142445.734|TR0|outpouring of support. Tens of 
20110128142445.734|20110128142447.568|TR0|thousands of people signed up 
20110128142447.568|20110128142449.403|TR0|and expressed support for the 
20110128142449.403|20110128142451.237|TR0|demonstration, inspired largely 
20110128142451.237|20110128142453.072|TR0|by the events of Tunisia a few 
20110128142453.072|20110128142454.906|TR0|weeks ago. So this was a 
20110128142454.906|20110128142456.741|TR0|youth-led spontaneous movement 
20110128142456.741|20110128142458.575|TR0|that's being fueled by the anger 
20110128142458.575|20110128142500.410|TR0|of young people across Egypt at 
20110128142500.410|20110128142502.244|TR0|all of the things that I listed 
20110128142502.244|20110128142504.078|TR0|before.
20110128142504.078|20110128142505.913|TR0|
20110128142505.913|20110128142507.747|TR0|But what we're seeing right now 
20110128142507.747|20110128142509.582|TR0|is very interesting. We're 
20110128142509.582|20110128142511.416|TR0|seeing all kinds of different 
20110128142511.416|20110128142513.251|TR0|groups coming out. We're seeing 
20110128142513.251|20110128142515.085|TR0|workers. We're seeing opposition 
20110128142515.085|20110128142516.920|TR0|political parties, who had at 
20110128142516.920|20110128142518.754|TR0|first been reluctant to support 
20110128142518.754|20110128142520.589|TR0|these protests, coming out in 
20110128142520.589|20110128142522.423|TR0|full force. And so, I think what 
20110128142522.423|20110128142524.258|TR0|we're witnessing is a 
20110128142524.258|20110128142526.092|TR0|transformation from what started 
20110128142526.092|20110128142527.926|TR0|as a youth-led movement, a 
20110128142527.926|20110128142529.761|TR0|movement of Egyptian young 
20110128142529.761|20110128142531.595|TR0|people demanding change, to a 
20110128142531.595|20110128142533.430|TR0|popular uprising.
20110128142533.430|20110128142535.264|TR0|
20110128142535.264|20110128142537.099|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Ahmad Shokr, 
20110128142537.099|20110128142538.933|TR0|describe the access people have 
20110128142538.933|20110128142540.768|TR0|to each other. Of course, you 
20110128142540.768|20110128142542.602|TR0|have just the mass protests in 
20110128142542.602|20110128142544.437|TR0|the streets, but the whole issue 
20110128142544.437|20110128142546.271|TR0|of Facebook and, well, social 
20110128142546.271|20110128142548.106|TR0|media altogether, Twitter. The 
20110128142548.106|20110128142549.940|TR0|internet itself is down, and yet 
20110128142549.940|20110128142551.774|TR0|there is a part of an internal 
20110128142551.774|20110128142553.609|TR0|system that can't be taken down, 
20110128142553.609|20110128142555.443|TR0|or the regime will be taking 
20110128142555.443|20110128142557.278|TR0|down the banks, altogether.
20110128142557.278|20110128142559.112|TR0|
20110128142559.112|20110128142600.947|TR0|>> AHMAD SHOKR: Yes. The 
20110128142600.947|20110128142602.781|TR0|internet has been completely 
20110128142602.781|20110128142604.616|TR0|down as of last night. The state 
20110128142604.616|20110128142606.450|TR0|has been interfering with access 
20110128142606.450|20110128142608.285|TR0|to both Facebook and Twitter for 
20110128142608.285|20110128142610.119|TR0|the past three days. And 
20110128142610.119|20110128142611.954|TR0|protesters have been finding 
20110128142611.954|20110128142613.788|TR0|ways to get around internet 
20110128142613.788|20110128142615.622|TR0|blockage, through using proxies 
20110128142615.622|20110128142617.457|TR0|and things like that. But today, 
20110128142617.457|20110128142619.291|TR0|I imagine, it's very difficult 
20110128142619.291|20110128142621.126|TR0|to access the internet. I mean, 
20110128142621.126|20110128142622.960|TR0|it's been completely shut down 
20110128142622.960|20110128142624.795|TR0|around the country. I think 
20110128142624.795|20110128142626.629|TR0|there's a handful of providers 
20110128142626.629|20110128142628.464|TR0|that are still operating. But 
20110128142628.464|20110128142630.298|TR0|most people do not have access 
20110128142630.298|20110128142632.133|TR0|to internet, do not have access 
20110128142632.133|20110128142633.967|TR0|to cell phones or text 
20110128142633.967|20110128142635.801|TR0|messaging. I believe the only 
20110128142635.801|20110128142637.636|TR0|channel of communication are in 
20110128142637.636|20110128142639.470|TR0|fact land lines. But much of 
20110128142639.470|20110128142641.305|TR0|what's happening on the streets 
20110128142641.305|20110128142643.139|TR0|right now has been planned for 
20110128142643.139|20110128142644.974|TR0|the past few days. People - many 
20110128142644.974|20110128142646.808|TR0|people intended to join protests 
20110128142646.808|20110128142648.643|TR0|after Friday prayers. And I also 
20110128142648.643|20110128142650.477|TR0|think there's a lot of 
20110128142650.477|20110128142652.312|TR0|spontaneity that's fueling this. 
20110128142652.312|20110128142654.146|TR0|It really is a spontaneous mass 
20110128142654.146|20110128142655.981|TR0|revolt that we're seeing on the 
20110128142655.981|20110128142657.815|TR0|streets right now.
20110128142657.815|20110128142659.649|TR0|
20110128142659.649|20110128142701.484|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Ahmad, 
20110128142701.484|20110128142703.318|TR0|what effect has the uprising in 
20110128142703.318|20110128142705.153|TR0|Tunisia that led to the ouster 
20110128142705.153|20110128142706.987|TR0|of President Ben Ali had on 
20110128142706.987|20110128142708.822|TR0|protests in Egypt?
20110128142708.822|20110128142710.656|TR0|
20110128142710.656|20110128142712.491|TR0|>> AHMAD SHOKR: Well, I think 
20110128142712.491|20110128142714.325|TR0|it's left people really 
20110128142714.325|20110128142716.160|TR0|inspired. And it's - you know, 
20110128142716.160|20110128142717.994|TR0|many people, for the first time, 
20110128142717.994|20110128142719.829|TR0|believe that revolution is 
20110128142719.829|20110128142721.663|TR0|possible, that political change 
20110128142721.663|20110128142723.497|TR0|from the street is something 
20110128142723.497|20110128142725.332|TR0|that can happen. You know, of 
20110128142725.332|20110128142727.166|TR0|course, there's many differences 
20110128142727.166|20110128142729.001|TR0|between Egypt and Tunisia, 
20110128142729.001|20110128142730.835|TR0|differences in the composition 
20110128142730.835|20110128142732.670|TR0|of the respective societies, of 
20110128142732.670|20110128142734.504|TR0|the regimes. Of course, the 
20110128142734.504|20110128142736.339|TR0|military and security forces in 
20110128142736.339|20110128142738.173|TR0|Egypt are much larger and much 
20110128142738.173|20110128142740.008|TR0|better equipped and better 
20110128142740.008|20110128142741.842|TR0|funded than they were in 
20110128142741.842|20110128142743.677|TR0|Tunisia. So, of course, there 
20110128142743.677|20110128142745.511|TR0|are differences, and a 
20110128142745.511|20110128142747.345|TR0|replication of Tunisian-style 
20110128142747.345|20110128142749.180|TR0|events in Egypt is still a 
20110128142749.180|20110128142751.014|TR0|question. But there's no doubt 
20110128142751.014|20110128142752.849|TR0|that people have definitely been 
20110128142752.849|20110128142754.683|TR0|incredibly inspired. I mean, 
20110128142754.683|20110128142756.518|TR0|people that I know personally, 
20110128142756.518|20110128142758.352|TR0|who just a few weeks ago would 
20110128142758.352|20110128142800.187|TR0|have never thought to set foot 
20110128142800.187|20110128142802.021|TR0|in a demonstration, who were, 
20110128142802.021|20110128142803.856|TR0|for the most part, completely 
20110128142803.856|20110128142805.690|TR0|depoliticized, are taking to the 
20110128142805.690|20110128142807.525|TR0|streets, are fired up and 
20110128142807.525|20110128142809.359|TR0|believe that being on the 
20110128142809.359|20110128142811.193|TR0|streets and calling for change 
20110128142811.193|20110128142813.028|TR0|can actually do something, can 
20110128142813.028|20110128142814.862|TR0|actually make a difference right 
20110128142814.862|20110128142816.697|TR0|now.
20110128142816.697|20110128142818.531|TR0|
20110128142818.531|20110128142820.366|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Ahmad, I've got 
20110128142820.366|20110128142822.200|TR0|two questions. I'd like you to 
20110128142822.200|20110128142824.035|TR0|end by once again describing 
20110128142824.035|20110128142825.869|TR0|what you're seeing as you 
20110128142825.869|20110128142827.704|TR0|overlook Tahrir Square and to 
20110128142827.704|20110128142829.538|TR0|talk about the significance of 
20110128142829.538|20110128142831.373|TR0|the square. But first, the role 
20110128142831.373|20110128142833.207|TR0|of the United States in shoring 
20110128142833.207|20110128142835.041|TR0|up the Mubarak regime. This is 
20110128142835.041|20110128142836.876|TR0|the place President Obama chose 
20110128142836.876|20110128142838.710|TR0|to give his address to the 
20110128142838.710|20110128142840.545|TR0|Muslim world, in Cairo. Egypt is 
20110128142840.545|20110128142842.379|TR0|the second-largest recipient of 
20110128142842.379|20110128142844.214|TR0|U.S. aid, well over $2 billion a 
20110128142844.214|20110128142846.048|TR0|year. How do Egyptians see the 
20110128142846.048|20110128142847.883|TR0|United States? And has Mubarak 
20110128142847.883|20110128142849.717|TR0|said anything at this point?
20110128142849.717|20110128142851.552|TR0|
20110128142851.552|20110128142853.386|TR0|>> AHMAD SHOKR: Well, I mean, 
20110128142853.386|20110128142855.221|TR0|like you said, Amy, the United 
20110128142855.221|20110128142857.055|TR0|States has long been a chief 
20110128142857.055|20110128142858.889|TR0|supporter of Egypt, financially, 
20110128142858.889|20110128142900.724|TR0|politically, militarily. And 
20110128142900.724|20110128142902.558|TR0|then they really see Egypt as 
20110128142902.558|20110128142904.393|TR0|central to their interests in 
20110128142904.393|20110128142906.227|TR0|the region and to preserving the 
20110128142906.227|20110128142908.062|TR0|status quo and stability, using 
20110128142908.062|20110128142909.896|TR0|their language, in the Middle 
20110128142909.896|20110128142911.731|TR0|East. And, you know, most 
20110128142911.731|20110128142913.565|TR0|Egyptians on the streets are 
20110128142913.565|20110128142915.400|TR0|well aware of this, are well 
20110128142915.400|20110128142917.234|TR0|aware that the authoritarian 
20110128142917.234|20110128142919.069|TR0|regime that they live under is 
20110128142919.069|20110128142920.903|TR0|propped up by the government of 
20110128142920.903|20110128142922.737|TR0|the United States, and are, I 
20110128142922.737|20110128142924.572|TR0|mean, obviously not happy about 
20110128142924.572|20110128142926.406|TR0|that.
20110128142926.406|20110128142928.241|TR0|
20110128142928.241|20110128142930.075|TR0|Now, Secretary of State Clinton 
20110128142930.075|20110128142931.910|TR0|made a statement a couple of 
20110128142931.910|20110128142933.744|TR0|days ago about reform in Egypt 
20110128142933.744|20110128142935.579|TR0|being imperative, about the

20110128142946.585|20110128142948.420|TR0|right now - again, right before 
20110128142948.420|20110128142950.254|TR0|me - is the complete opposite. 
20110128142950.254|20110128142952.089|TR0|We see a violent, violent 
20110128142952.089|20110128142953.923|TR0|dispersal of protesters, who are 
20110128142953.923|20110128142955.758|TR0|marching in the streets, who are 
20110128142955.758|20110128142957.592|TR0|telling riot police that they 
20110128142957.592|20110128142959.427|TR0|want to march peacefully, and 
20110128142959.427|20110128143001.261|TR0|they've been completely blocked 
20110128143001.261|20110128143003.096|TR0|off from getting to Tahrir 
20110128143003.096|20110128143004.930|TR0|Square, which is the central 
20110128143004.930|20110128143006.765|TR0|square of Cairo.

20110128143008.599|20110128143010.433|TR0|Now, just to clarify, I'm 
20110128143010.433|20110128143012.268|TR0|actually not looking at Tahrir 
20110128143012.268|20110128143014.102|TR0|Square right now. I'm looking at 
20110128143014.102|20110128143015.937|TR0|one of the main bridges in Cairo 
20110128143015.937|20110128143017.771|TR0|that leads into the square. So, 
20110128143017.771|20110128143019.606|TR0|the square is completely covered 
20110128143019.606|20110128143021.440|TR0|with Central Security forces, 
20110128143021.440|20110128143023.275|TR0|and they're blocking any

20110128143025.109|20110128143026.944|TR0|there, which is what these 
20110128143026.944|20110128143028.778|TR0|people on the bridge are trying 
20110128143028.778|20110128143030.613|TR0|to do. And as I speak, the 
20110128143030.613|20110128143032.447|TR0|clashes are still going on. 
20110128143032.447|20110128143034.281|TR0|There's tear gas canisters being 
20110128143034.281|20110128143036.116|TR0|fired. The tear gas has covered 
20110128143036.116|20110128143037.950|TR0|the whole area. And it's still 
20110128143037.950|20110128143039.785|TR0|going on in front of me right

20110128143315.714|20110128143317.548|TR0|seen, in the last three decades, 
20110128143317.548|20110128143319.383|TR0|a series of Arab nationalist 
20110128143319.383|20110128143321.217|TR0|regimes, relatively secular, 
20110128143321.217|20110128143323.052|TR0|which have become increasingly 
20110128143323.052|20110128143324.886|TR0|sclerotic. These were 
20110128143324.886|20110128143326.721|TR0|postcolonial societies, 
20110128143326.721|20110128143328.555|TR0|societies that had been under 
20110128143328.555|20110128143330.390|TR0|Western dominance often, which - 
20110128143330.390|20110128143332.224|TR0|and that dominance was opposed 
20110128143332.224|20110128143334.059|TR0|by nationalist movements, led by 
20110128143334.059|20110128143335.893|TR0|legends like Habib Bourguiba in 
20110128143335.893|20110128143337.728|TR0|Tunisia or Gamal Abdel Nasser in 
20110128143337.728|20110128143339.562|TR0|Egypt. And they were wildly 
20110128143339.562|20110128143341.396|TR0|popular in their day, because 
20110128143341.396|20110128143343.231|TR0|they were throwing off the West. 
20110128143343.231|20110128143345.065|TR0|But as time went on, the regimes 
20110128143345.065|20110128143346.900|TR0|that were set up became 
20110128143346.900|20110128143348.734|TR0|dominated by a kind of state 
20110128143348.734|20110128143350.569|TR0|elite, a relatively small group 
20110128143350.569|20110128143352.403|TR0|of people that benefited from 
20110128143352.403|20110128143354.238|TR0|state power, from the large 
20110128143354.238|20110128143356.072|TR0|public sector, from the throwing

20110128143429.092|20110128143430.927|TR0|power?
20110128143430.927|20110128143432.761|TR0|
20110128143432.761|20110128143434.596|TR0|>> JUAN COLE: Hosni Mubarak is a 
20110128143434.596|20110128143436.430|TR0|former air force chief of staff 
20110128143436.430|20110128143438.265|TR0|and general. He was trained in 
20110128143438.265|20110128143440.099|TR0|Moscow. He speaks good Russian. 
20110128143440.099|20110128143441.934|TR0|And he is the third in the 
20110128143441.934|20110128143443.768|TR0|series of military leaders of 
20110128143443.768|20110128143445.603|TR0|Egypt since 1952, or you could 
20110128143445.603|20110128143447.437|TR0|say the fourth, in some ways. In 
20110128143447.437|20110128143449.272|TR0|any case, they've all been 
20110128143449.272|20110128143451.106|TR0|military men. They've all come 
20110128143451.106|20110128143452.940|TR0|out of the military. They're 
20110128143452.940|20110128143454.775|TR0|backed by the existing military. 
20110128143454.775|20110128143456.609|TR0|And that's - so Egypt is a 
20110128143456.609|20110128143458.444|TR0|Praetorian regime, and this is 
20110128143458.444|20110128143500.278|TR0|sometimes forgotten now because 
20110128143500.278|20110128143502.113|TR0|Mubarak wears business suits and 
20110128143502.113|20110128143503.947|TR0|there's an elected parliament, 
20110128143503.947|20110128143505.782|TR0|although the elections are 
20110128143505.782|20110128143507.616|TR0|widely believed not to be on the 
20110128143507.616|20110128143509.451|TR0|up and up.
20110128143509.451|20110128143511.285|TR0|
20110128143511.285|20110128143513.120|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Juan Cole, I 
20110128143513.120|20110128143514.954|TR0|wanted to ask you about the U.S. 
20110128143514.954|20110128143516.788|TR0|role in the shoring up of 
20110128143516.788|20110128143518.623|TR0|Mubarak over these 30 years, the 
20110128143518.623|20110128143520.457|TR0|same question that I put to 
20110128143520.457|20110128143522.292|TR0|Ahmad Shokr, the more than $2 
20110128143522.292|20110128143524.126|TR0|billion, second-largest 
20110128143524.126|20110128143525.961|TR0|recipient of U.S. foreign aid 
20110128143525.961|20110128143527.795|TR0|next to Israel, and what that 
20110128143527.795|20110128143529.630|TR0|means - President Obama's speech 
20110128143529.630|20110128143531.464|TR0|there, what the U.S. 
20110128143531.464|20110128143533.299|TR0|relationship is, and if the U.S. 
20110128143533.299|20110128143535.133|TR0|said to Mubarak that they would 
20110128143535.133|20110128143536.967|TR0|withdraw aid, what you think he 
20110128143536.967|20110128143538.802|TR0|would do.
20110128143538.802|20110128143540.636|TR0|
20110128143540.636|20110128143542.471|TR0|>> JUAN COLE: Well, I think the 
20110128143542.471|20110128143544.305|TR0|U.S. aid is nice for the 
20110128143544.305|20110128143546.140|TR0|Egyptian elite to have. I don't 
20110128143546.140|20110128143547.974|TR0|think it's essential to them. It 
20110128143547.974|20110128143549.809|TR0|should be remembered that the 
20110128143549.809|20110128143551.643|TR0|U.S. aid is a little bit of a 
20110128143551.643|20110128143553.478|TR0|shell game, because Congress 
20110128143553.478|20110128143555.312|TR0|typically directs that all of 
20110128143555.312|20110128143557.147|TR0|the materiel come from the 
20110128143557.147|20110128143558.981|TR0|United States. So it's actually 
20110128143558.981|20110128143600.815|TR0|aid to U.S. corporations, and 
20110128143600.815|20110128143602.650|TR0|then the Egyptians get some of 
20110128143602.650|20110128143604.484|TR0|it in the form of goods and so 
20110128143604.484|20110128143606.319|TR0|forth, military weaponry, which 
20110128143606.319|20110128143608.153|TR0|they mostly don't need.
20110128143608.153|20110128143609.988|TR0|
20110128143609.988|20110128143611.822|TR0|I think the U.S. aid was 
20110128143611.822|20110128143613.657|TR0|initiated because Egypt made a 
20110128143613.657|20110128143615.491|TR0|peace treaty with Israel. It's 
20110128143615.491|20110128143617.326|TR0|Congress's way of more or less 
20110128143617.326|20110128143619.160|TR0|bribing Egypt to remain on good 
20110128143619.160|20110128143620.995|TR0|terms with Israel. A lot of it 
20110128143620.995|20110128143622.829|TR0|is military aid, so that the 
20110128143622.829|20110128143624.663|TR0|Egyptian military remains 
20110128143624.663|20110128143626.498|TR0|relatively strong. But that 
20110128143626.498|20110128143628.332|TR0|military has taken itself out of 
20110128143628.332|20110128143630.167|TR0|the game of Middle East 
20110128143630.167|20110128143632.001|TR0|politics. In some ways, it's 
20110128143632.001|20110128143633.836|TR0|been absent from the great 
20110128143633.836|20110128143635.670|TR0|struggles - the Gaza war, the 
20110128143635.670|20110128143637.505|TR0|Lebanon war. Egypt kind of 
20110128143637.505|20110128143639.339|TR0|stands off and says, "Well, 
20110128143639.339|20110128143641.174|TR0|that's really too bad. They 
20110128143641.174|20110128143643.008|TR0|shouldn't be fighting like that."
20110128143643.008|20110128143644.843|TR0|
20110128143644.843|20110128143646.677|TR0|So, in contrast to the kind of 
20110128143646.677|20110128143648.511|TR0|muscular nationalism of the 
20110128143648.511|20110128143650.346|TR0|1960s, when Gamal Abdel Nasser 
20110128143650.346|20110128143652.180|TR0|made Egypt the center of the 
20110128143652.180|20110128143654.015|TR0|Arab world and in some ways also 
20110128143654.015|20110128143655.849|TR0|of Africa, now Egypt is - you 
20110128143655.849|20110128143657.684|TR0|know, its regime really has been 
20110128143657.684|20110128143659.518|TR0|taking a quiet bribe to turn 
20110128143659.518|20110128143701.353|TR0|inward, to concentrate on 
20110128143701.353|20110128143703.187|TR0|building up its tourist 
20110128143703.187|20110128143705.022|TR0|industry. And it has had some 
20110128143705.022|20110128143706.856|TR0|success in fostering economic 
20110128143706.856|20110128143708.691|TR0|growth in the past 10 years, 
20110128143708.691|20110128143710.525|TR0|although it's the kind of growth 
20110128143710.525|20110128143712.359|TR0|such that a lot of the increased 
20110128143712.359|20110128143714.194|TR0|revenue is going to the elites, 
20110128143714.194|20110128143716.028|TR0|in any case.

20110128143717.863|20110128143719.697|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Juan 
20110128143719.697|20110128143721.532|TR0|Cole, I want to play what 
20110128143721.532|20110128143723.366|TR0|President Obama had to say 
20110128143723.366|20110128143725.201|TR0|yesterday about the situation in 
20110128143725.201|20110128143727.035|TR0|Egypt. He made his first 
20110128143727.035|20110128143728.870|TR0|comments in response to a 
20110128143728.870|20110128143730.704|TR0|question about Egypt during a 
20110128143730.704|20110128143732.539|TR0|live YouTube interview. Take a 
20110128143732.539|20110128143734.373|TR0|listen.
20110128143734.373|20110128143736.207|TR0|
20110128143736.207|20110128143738.042|TR0|>> PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's 
20110128143738.042|20110128143739.876|TR0|my main hope right now is, is 
20110128143739.876|20110128143741.711|TR0|that violence is not the answer 
20110128143741.711|20110128143743.545|TR0|in solving these problems in 
20110128143743.545|20110128143745.380|TR0|Egypt. So the government has to 
20110128143745.380|20110128143747.214|TR0|be careful about not resorting 
20110128143747.214|20110128143749.049|TR0|to violence, and the people on 
20110128143749.049|20110128143750.883|TR0|the streets have to be careful 
20110128143750.883|20110128143752.718|TR0|about not resorting to violence. 
20110128143752.718|20110128143754.552|TR0|And I think that it is very 
20110128143754.552|20110128143756.387|TR0|important that people have 
20110128143756.387|20110128143758.221|TR0|mechanisms in order to express 
20110128143758.221|20110128143800.055|TR0|legitimate grievances. As I said 
20110128143800.055|20110128143801.890|TR0|in my State of the Union speech, 
20110128143801.890|20110128143803.724|TR0|there are certain core values 
20110128143803.724|20110128143805.559|TR0|that we believe in as Americans 
20110128143805.559|20110128143807.393|TR0|that we believe are universal - 
20110128143807.393|20110128143809.228|TR0|freedom of speech, freedom of 
20110128143809.228|20110128143811.062|TR0|expression, people being able to 
20110128143811.062|20110128143812.897|TR0|use social networking or any 
20110128143812.897|20110128143814.731|TR0|other mechanisms to communicate 
20110128143814.731|20110128143816.566|TR0|with each other and express 
20110128143816.566|20110128143818.400|TR0|their concerns. And that, I 
20110128143818.400|20110128143820.235|TR0|think, is no less true in the 
20110128143820.235|20110128143822.069|TR0|Arab world than it is here in 
20110128143822.069|20110128143823.903|TR0|the United States.

20110128143838.579|20110128143840.414|TR0|made the comment in an interview

20110128143845.917|20110128143847.751|TR0|Look, Mubarak has been an ally 
20110128143847.751|20110128143849.586|TR0|of ours in a number of things 
20110128143849.586|20110128143851.420|TR0|that he's been very responsible

20110128143918.937|20110128143920.772|TR0|wanting to define a dictator not 
20110128143920.772|20110128143922.606|TR0|with regard to domestic policy, 
20110128143922.606|20110128143924.441|TR0|but with regard to the 
20110128143924.441|20110128143926.275|TR0|responsible role the regime 
20110128143926.275|20110128143928.110|TR0|plays in the international world 
20110128143928.110|20110128143929.944|TR0|system, you know, from 
20110128143929.944|20110128143931.779|TR0|Washington's point of view. But 
20110128143931.779|20110128143933.613|TR0|certainly, from the point of 
20110128143933.613|20110128143935.447|TR0|view of human rights activists 
20110128143935.447|20110128143937.282|TR0|in Egypt, there are strong 
20110128143937.282|20110128143939.116|TR0|dictatorial tendencies in the 
20110128143939.116|20110128143940.951|TR0|Egyptian government. It's seen a 
20110128143940.951|20110128143942.785|TR0|lot of phony elections. It's 
20110128143942.785|20110128143944.620|TR0|used repressive techniques.
20110128143944.620|20110128143946.454|TR0|
20110128143946.454|20110128143948.289|TR0|In some instances, those 
20110128143948.289|20110128143950.123|TR0|repressive techniques have been 
20110128143950.123|20110128143951.958|TR0|directed against radical 
20110128143951.958|20110128143953.792|TR0|movements. The Egyptian Islamic 
20110128143953.792|20110128143955.626|TR0|Jihad of Ayman al-Zawahiri was 
20110128143955.626|20110128143957.461|TR0|active in Egypt in the 1980s and 
20110128143957.461|20110128143959.295|TR0|'90s, blowing up things, 
20110128143959.295|20110128144001.130|TR0|shooting down tourists and 
20110128144001.130|20110128144002.964|TR0|others. And these same secret 
20110128144002.964|20110128144004.799|TR0|police were deployed at that 
20110128144004.799|20110128144006.633|TR0|time to track them down, arrest 
20110128144006.633|20110128144008.468|TR0|them, and really to eradicate 
20110128144008.468|20110128144010.302|TR0|them from the scene in Egypt.
20110128144010.302|20110128144012.137|TR0|
20110128144012.137|20110128144013.971|TR0|And this is one of the things 
20110128144013.971|20110128144015.806|TR0|that drives this regime's 
20110128144015.806|20110128144017.640|TR0|repressiveness, is that it is 
20110128144017.640|20110128144019.474|TR0|afraid of Muslim fundamentalist 
20110128144019.474|20110128144021.309|TR0|movements. Whether they are 
20110128144021.309|20110128144023.143|TR0|radical - and there have been a 
20110128144023.143|20110128144024.978|TR0|number of important radical 
20110128144024.978|20110128144026.812|TR0|movements in Egypt that have 
20110128144026.812|20110128144028.647|TR0|resorted to violence - or 
20110128144028.647|20110128144030.481|TR0|whether they are social and 
20110128144030.481|20110128144032.316|TR0|political, as with the large and 
20110128144032.316|20110128144034.150|TR0|important Muslim Brotherhood 
20110128144034.150|20110128144035.985|TR0|movement, the regime is very 
20110128144035.985|20110128144037.819|TR0|afraid - and this comes out from 
20110128144037.819|20110128144039.654|TR0|U.S. cables that have been 
20110128144039.654|20110128144041.488|TR0|released by WikiLeaks - that the 
20110128144041.488|20110128144043.322|TR0|Muslim Brotherhood will find a 
20110128144043.322|20110128144045.157|TR0|way to take over. And, you know, 
20110128144045.157|20110128144046.991|TR0|when Khomeini overthrew the Shah 
20110128144046.991|20110128144048.826|TR0|in Iran in 1979, the first thing 
20110128144048.826|20110128144050.660|TR0|they did was execute a lot of 
20110128144050.660|20110128144052.495|TR0|the generals. And the generals 
20110128144052.495|20110128144054.329|TR0|in Egypt are bound and 
20110128144054.329|20110128144056.164|TR0|determined that a similar fate 
20110128144056.164|20110128144057.998|TR0|does not await them.
20110128144057.998|20110128144059.833|TR0|
20110128144059.833|20110128144101.667|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Professor Cole, 
20110128144101.667|20110128144103.502|TR0|a confidential diplomatic cable, 
20110128144103.502|20110128144105.336|TR0|that was released by WikiLeaks 
20110128144105.336|20110128144107.170|TR0|in the latest release, was 
20110128144107.170|20110128144109.005|TR0|signed by the American 
20110128144109.005|20110128144110.839|TR0|ambassador to Egypt, Margaret 
20110128144110.839|20110128144112.674|TR0|Scobey, advising Secretary of 
20110128144112.674|20110128144114.508|TR0|State Hillary Clinton to avoid 
20110128144114.508|20110128144116.343|TR0|mentioning the name of the 
20110128144116.343|20110128144118.177|TR0|opposition leader Ayman Nour 
20110128144118.177|20110128144120.012|TR0|during her 2009 meeting with 
20110128144120.012|20110128144121.846|TR0|Mubarak, even though Nour's 
20110128144121.846|20110128144123.681|TR0|imprisonment in 2005 had been 
20110128144123.681|20110128144125.515|TR0|condemned worldwide, not least 
20110128144125.515|20110128144127.350|TR0|by the Bush administration. 
20110128144127.350|20110128144129.184|TR0|Sharif just reported that Al 
20110128144129.184|20110128144131.018|TR0|Jazeera is saying that Ayman 
20110128144131.018|20110128144132.853|TR0|Nour was just attacked, hit in 
20110128144132.853|20110128144134.687|TR0|the head with a rock and now in 
20110128144134.687|20110128144136.522|TR0|hospital. Can you talk about the 
20110128144136.522|20110128144138.356|TR0|significance of this leaked memo 
20110128144138.356|20110128144140.191|TR0|and the significance of Ayman 
20110128144140.191|20110128144142.025|TR0|Nour himself?
20110128144142.025|20110128144143.860|TR0|
20110128144143.860|20110128144145.694|TR0|>> JUAN COLE: Well, Nour, at 
20110128144145.694|20110128144147.529|TR0|that time that the memo was 
20110128144147.529|20110128144149.363|TR0|written, had just been released 
20110128144149.363|20110128144151.198|TR0|from prison by Mubarak, and he 
20110128144151.198|20110128144153.032|TR0|leads a relatively small 
20110128144153.032|20110128144154.866|TR0|middle-class reform movement. 
20110128144154.866|20110128144156.701|TR0|And he did dare to challenge 
20110128144156.701|20110128144158.535|TR0|Mubarak in the 2005 presidential 
20110128144158.535|20110128144200.370|TR0|elections. And as you say, the 
20110128144200.370|20110128144202.204|TR0|Bush administration put pressure 
20110128144202.204|20110128144204.039|TR0|on Hosni Mubarak to open up 
20110128144204.039|20110128144205.873|TR0|those elections. The elections 
20110128144205.873|20110128144207.708|TR0|for president in Egypt prior to 
20110128144207.708|20110128144209.542|TR0|that had been largely symbolic. 
20110128144209.542|20110128144211.377|TR0|They had been a kind of 
20110128144211.377|20110128144213.211|TR0|referendum. And of course, in a 
20110128144213.211|20110128144215.046|TR0|referendum, you can't really 
20110128144215.046|20110128144216.880|TR0|lose. So, Mubarak responded to 
20110128144216.880|20110128144218.714|TR0|this pressure by having the 
20110128144218.714|20110128144220.549|TR0|constitution changed so that a 
20110128144220.549|20110128144222.383|TR0|number of people could run for 
20110128144222.383|20110128144224.218|TR0|president, not just him. And 
20110128144224.218|20110128144226.052|TR0|Ayman Nour was one of the ones 
20110128144226.052|20110128144227.887|TR0|who ran, but he had been in 
20110128144227.887|20110128144229.721|TR0|prison. And Mubarak let him out 
20110128144229.721|20110128144231.556|TR0|of prison, let him run. He got 
20110128144231.556|20110128144233.390|TR0|seven percent of the vote. And 
20110128144233.390|20110128144235.225|TR0|then Mubarak promptly jailed him 
20110128144235.225|20110128144237.059|TR0|again after he lost the 
20110128144237.059|20110128144238.894|TR0|election. So, Mubarak's response 
20110128144238.894|20110128144240.728|TR0|to American pressure at that 
20110128144240.728|20110128144242.562|TR0|time really made a mockery of 
20110128144242.562|20110128144244.397|TR0|it. And so, when he let Ayman 
20110128144244.397|20110128144246.231|TR0|Nour out of prison shortly 
20110128144246.231|20110128144248.066|TR0|before Hillary Clinton's visit, 
20110128144248.066|20110128144249.900|TR0|he was concerned that the 
20110128144249.900|20110128144251.735|TR0|Americans not draw attention to 
20110128144251.735|20110128144253.569|TR0|this opposition figure, and he 
20110128144253.569|20110128144255.404|TR0|requested that no mention be 
20110128144255.404|20110128144257.238|TR0|made.
20110128144257.238|20110128144259.073|TR0|
20110128144259.073|20110128144300.907|TR0|And the Americans, you know, are 
20110128144300.907|20110128144302.742|TR0|in a difficult position in some 
20110128144302.742|20110128144304.576|TR0|ways in Egypt. On the one hand, 
20110128144304.576|20110128144306.410|TR0|you know, the State Department 
20110128144306.410|20110128144308.245|TR0|does do human rights reports. It 
20110128144308.245|20110128144310.079|TR0|does support a widening of civil 
20110128144310.079|20110128144311.914|TR0|liberties in these countries. On 
20110128144311.914|20110128144313.748|TR0|the other hand, Egypt is a 
20110128144313.748|20110128144315.583|TR0|central ally of the United 
20110128144315.583|20110128144317.417|TR0|States, and the U.S. would 
20110128144317.417|20110128144319.252|TR0|certainly be very unhappy to see 
20110128144319.252|20110128144321.086|TR0|it replaced by a Muslim 
20110128144321.086|20110128144322.921|TR0|Brotherhood regime that would 
20110128144322.921|20110128144324.755|TR0|abrogate the Camp David Accords, 
20110128144324.755|20110128144326.590|TR0|would adopt a hostile posture 
20110128144326.590|20110128144328.424|TR0|towards Israel possibly, would 
20110128144328.424|20110128144330.258|TR0|cease military cooperation with 
20110128144330.258|20110128144332.093|TR0|the United States. So, the U.S. 
20110128144332.093|20110128144333.927|TR0|is trying to navigate between 
20110128144333.927|20110128144335.762|TR0|the shoals of these various 
20110128144335.762|20110128144337.596|TR0|dilemmas.

20110128144436.299|20110128144438.133|TR0|has sparked both domestic and

20110128144503.816|20110128144505.650|TR0|>> ANJALI KAMAT: Dr. Binayak Sen 
20110128144505.650|20110128144507.485|TR0|is world-renowned as a physician 
20110128144507.485|20110128144509.319|TR0|who dedicated his life to 
20110128144509.319|20110128144511.154|TR0|working among some of India's 
20110128144511.154|20110128144512.988|TR0|poorest communities. But now 
20110128144512.988|20110128144514.823|TR0|he's the country's best-known 
20110128144514.823|20110128144516.657|TR0|political prisoner, convicted of 
20110128144516.657|20110128144518.492|TR0|sedition and criminal 
20110128144518.492|20110128144520.326|TR0|conspiracy. In December, a trial 
20110128144520.326|20110128144522.161|TR0|judge found him guilty of 
20110128144522.161|20110128144523.995|TR0|supporting an outlawed group of 
20110128144523.995|20110128144525.829|TR0|Maoists, or Naxalites. I met 
20110128144525.829|20110128144527.664|TR0|Binayak Sen's wife, Ilina Sen, 
20110128144527.664|20110128144529.498|TR0|at their home in Raipur. She 
20110128144529.498|20110128144531.333|TR0|called the trial a "sham" and 
20110128144531.333|20110128144533.167|TR0|emphasized the lack of any 
20110128144533.167|20110128144535.002|TR0|credible evidence against him.

20110128144536.836|20110128144538.671|TR0|>> ILINA SEN: The prosecution 
20110128144538.671|20110128144540.505|TR0|has not produced evidence, 
20110128144540.505|20110128144542.340|TR0|Anjali. It has produced many 
20110128144542.340|20110128144544.174|TR0|allegations. And then they've 
20110128144544.174|20110128144546.009|TR0|clung to straws, you know, to 
20110128144546.009|20110128144547.843|TR0|prove those allegations. And 
20110128144547.843|20110128144549.677|TR0|some of those allegations and 
20110128144549.677|20110128144551.512|TR0|some of those straws are absurd, 
20110128144551.512|20110128144553.346|TR0|and they do not really prove the 
20110128144553.346|20110128144555.181|TR0|allegations. So, very little 
20110128144555.181|20110128144557.015|TR0|hard evidence. So, if Binayak 
20110128144557.015|20110128144558.850|TR0|was a Maoist supporter, there 
20110128144558.850|20110128144600.684|TR0|would be something on record.

20110128144602.519|20110128144604.353|TR0|>> ANJALI KAMAT: But when the

20110128144613.525|20110128144615.360|TR0|severity of the danger posed by 
20110128144615.360|20110128144617.194|TR0|Maoists. The armed rebels do 
20110128144617.194|20110128144619.029|TR0|have an active presence in the 
20110128144619.029|20110128144620.863|TR0|dense southern forests of the 
20110128144620.863|20110128144622.698|TR0|central Indian state of 
20110128144622.698|20110128144624.532|TR0|Chhattisgarh. This is also where 
20110128144624.532|20110128144626.367|TR0|Binayak Sen and his family have 
20110128144626.367|20110128144628.201|TR0|lived for nearly 30 years, 
20110128144628.201|20110128144630.036|TR0|addressing the public health 
20110128144630.036|20110128144631.870|TR0|needs of the tribal or adivasi

20110128144633.705|20110128144635.539|TR0|near-famine conditions. Ilina 
20110128144635.539|20110128144637.373|TR0|Sen says that if the Maoists 
20110128144637.373|20110128144639.208|TR0|have gained a foothold in this 
20110128144639.208|20110128144641.042|TR0|region, it's because of the long 
20110128144641.042|20110128144642.877|TR0|history of neglect and abuse by 
20110128144642.877|20110128144644.711|TR0|the state.

20110128144646.546|20110128144648.380|TR0|>> ILINA SEN: I think people 
20110128144648.380|20110128144650.215|TR0|turn to the Maoists as a last 
20110128144650.215|20110128144652.049|TR0|resort, because these areas were 
20110128144652.049|20110128144653.884|TR0|areas for a long time where the 
20110128144653.884|20110128144655.718|TR0|government was completely 
20110128144655.718|20110128144657.553|TR0|absent. And in a history of 60 
20110128144657.553|20110128144659.387|TR0|years, and then this was where 
20110128144659.387|20110128144701.221|TR0|governance was not there. And if 
20110128144701.221|20110128144703.056|TR0|the government was there, it was 
20110128144703.056|20110128144704.890|TR0|in the role of an exploiter. 
20110128144704.890|20110128144706.725|TR0|People who took bribes, people 
20110128144706.725|20110128144708.559|TR0|who demanded bribes, demanded

20110128144710.394|20110128144712.228|TR0|oppressed by that. So, the fact 
20110128144712.228|20110128144714.063|TR0|that there was not a sensitive 
20110128144714.063|20110128144715.897|TR0|governance in that area did a 
20110128144715.897|20110128144717.732|TR0|lot to drive people into the

20110128144728.738|20110128144730.573|TR0|campaigns here escalated after 
20110128144730.573|20110128144732.407|TR0|two Naxalite factions merged in 
20110128144732.407|20110128144734.242|TR0|2004. Five years later, they 
20110128144734.242|20110128144736.076|TR0|were banned as a terrorist

20110128145408.651|20110128145410.485|TR0|obviously shaken by the kind of 
20110128145410.485|20110128145412.320|TR0|judgment that - because the 
20110128145412.320|20110128145414.154|TR0|lower judiciary cannot be 
20110128145414.154|20110128145415.989|TR0|exempt. I appreciate the fact 
20110128145415.989|20110128145417.823|TR0|that in the Indian judicial 
20110128145417.823|20110128145419.658|TR0|system there is recourse to 
20110128145419.658|20110128145421.492|TR0|appeal, unlike in the Maoist 
20110128145421.492|20110128145423.327|TR0|judicial system, because there 
20110128145423.327|20110128145425.161|TR0|you have the janata sarkar and 
20110128145425.161|20110128145426.995|TR0|the jan adalats. And the jan 
20110128145426.995|20110128145428.830|TR0|adalat takes a decision, might 
20110128145428.830|20110128145430.664|TR0|decide to behead you, and it's 
20110128145430.664|20110128145432.499|TR0|instantly carried out. So there 
20110128145432.499|20110128145434.333|TR0|is no room for appeal, no room 
20110128145434.333|20110128145436.168|TR0|for recourse. That is something 
20110128145436.168|20110128145438.002|TR0|that is not tenable. I don't buy 
20110128145438.002|20110128145439.837|TR0|that. I don't support that. So 
20110128145439.837|20110128145441.671|TR0|the fact that the Indian - 
20110128145441.671|20110128145443.506|TR0|Indian judiciary leaves room for 
20110128145443.506|20110128145445.340|TR0|appeal, but I think there is 
20110128145445.340|20110128145447.175|TR0|widespread, you know, scope for

20110128145511.023|20110128145512.857|TR0|mean, in Chhattisgarh the 
20110128145512.857|20110128145514.691|TR0|numbers are huge. I mean, in

20110128145516.526|20110128145518.360|TR0|around 700 adivasi under trials

20110128145520.195|20110128145522.029|TR0|And because the whole atmosphere 
20110128145522.029|20110128145523.864|TR0|is so loaded, you can just call
