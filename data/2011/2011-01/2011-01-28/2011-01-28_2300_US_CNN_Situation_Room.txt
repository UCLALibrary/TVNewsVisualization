20110128230007.000|20110128230009.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, HOST:  And you're in THE 
20110128230009.000|20110128230011.000|TR0|SITUATION ROOM.
20110128230011.000|20110128230013.000|TR0|
20110128230013.000|20110128230015.000|TR0|Happening now, breaking news.  Egypt's 
20110128230015.000|20110128230017.000|TR0|president breaks his silence as his 
20110128230017.000|20110128230019.000|TR0|country reels from days of violent 
20110128230019.000|20110128230021.000|TR0|protests demanding his resignation.  But 
20110128230021.000|20110128230024.000|TR0|what he said just a little while ago is 
20110128230024.000|20110128230026.000|TR0|only fueling the outrage.
20110128230026.000|20110128230028.000|TR0|
20110128230028.000|20110128230030.000|TR0|Also, did President Obama plant a seed for 
20110128230030.000|20110128230032.000|TR0|this uprising with his speech in Cairo?  
20110128230032.000|20110128230034.000|TR0|We're going to play some of that for you.  
20110128230034.000|20110128230036.000|TR0|You be the judge.
20110128230036.000|20110128230038.000|TR0|
20110128230038.000|20110128230041.000|TR0|Plus, the Pentagon in emergency mode right 
20110128230041.000|20110128230043.000|TR0|now over the situation in Egypt.  Why the 
20110128230043.000|20110128230045.000|TR0|U.S. military is deeply concerned about 
20110128230045.000|20110128230047.000|TR0|what could happen if the Egyptian 
20110128230047.000|20110128230049.000|TR0|government of President Mubarak falls.
20110128230049.000|20110128230051.000|TR0|
20110128230051.000|20110128230053.000|TR0|We want to welcome our viewers in the

20110128230104.000|20110128230106.000|TR0|After several days of chaos across Egypt, 
20110128230106.000|20110128230108.000|TR0|the country's longtime president who 
20110128230108.000|20110128230110.000|TR0|protesters want out of power finally came 
20110128230110.000|20110128230113.000|TR0|out to address the nation.  His message: 
20110128230113.000|20110128230115.000|TR0|let's start over.  You saw it live only 
20110128230115.000|20110128230117.000|TR0|moments ago, right here on CNN.  President 
20110128230117.000|20110128230119.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak ordering the government to 
20110128230119.000|20110128230121.000|TR0|resign.

20110128230127.000|20110128230130.000|TR0|HOSNI MUBARAK, EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT (through 
20110128230130.000|20110128230132.000|TR0|translator):  I take responsibility for 
20110128230132.000|20110128230134.000|TR0|the security of this country and the 
20110128230134.000|20110128230136.000|TR0|citizens.  I will not let this happen.  I 
20110128230136.000|20110128230138.000|TR0|will not let fear to live in the citizen 
20110128230138.000|20110128230140.000|TR0|or to let them tell us what's going to 
20110128230140.000|20110128230142.000|TR0|happen in the future.
20110128230142.000|20110128230145.000|TR0|
20110128230145.000|20110128230147.000|TR0|I ask the government to resign today, and 
20110128230147.000|20110128230149.000|TR0|I will tell the new government from 
20110128230149.000|20110128230151.000|TR0|tomorrow in very specific goals to work 
20110128230151.000|20110128230153.000|TR0|with the current situation.
20110128230153.000|20110128230155.000|TR0|
20110128230155.000|20110128230157.000|TR0|I would say again, I will not be easy to 
20110128230157.000|20110128230159.000|TR0|take any -- to decide anything unless it's 
20110128230159.000|20110128230202.000|TR0|for the Egyptians.

20110128230208.000|20110128230210.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  But he says 
20110128230210.000|20110128230212.000|TR0|he's staying put.  He's not going anywhere 
20110128230212.000|20110128230214.000|TR0|-- the statement comes a day of -- full of 
20110128230214.000|20110128230217.000|TR0|violence across Egypt.  It's been massive 
20110128230217.000|20110128230219.000|TR0|out there.       A military vehicle seen 
20110128230219.000|20110128230221.000|TR0|rolling through a crowd of protesters in 
20110128230221.000|20110128230223.000|TR0|Suez, where one person was reported 
20110128230223.000|20110128230225.000|TR0|killed.  In Cairo, look at this, sent to 
20110128230225.000|20110128230227.000|TR0|us by one our CNN iReporters, thousands of 
20110128230227.000|20110128230229.000|TR0|people marching along the Nile River 
20110128230229.000|20110128230231.000|TR0|bombarded with tear gas by police, some of 
20110128230231.000|20110128230234.000|TR0|them throwing the canisters right back at 
20110128230234.000|20110128230236.000|TR0|them.
20110128230236.000|20110128230238.000|TR0|
20110128230238.000|20110128230240.000|TR0|And in another part of the capital, the 
20110128230240.000|20110128230242.000|TR0|headquarters of President Mubarak's ruling 
20110128230242.000|20110128230244.000|TR0|party burned and looted.  Right now people 
20110128230244.000|20110128230246.000|TR0|are pouring onto the streets of Cairo, 
20110128230246.000|20110128230248.000|TR0|saying they want President Mubarak out 
20110128230248.000|20110128230251.000|TR0|despite an official curfew.
20110128230251.000|20110128230253.000|TR0|
20110128230253.000|20110128230255.000|TR0|Let's go straight to Cairo.  CNN's Fred 
20110128230255.000|20110128230257.000|TR0|Pleitgen is on the ground for us.
20110128230257.000|20110128230259.000|TR0|
20110128230259.000|20110128230301.000|TR0|Fred, all right, set the scene.  What is 
20110128230301.000|20110128230303.000|TR0|going on right now? It's after 1:00 a.m. 
20110128230303.000|20110128230306.000|TR0|in Cairo.
20110128230306.000|20110128230308.000|TR0|
20110128230308.000|20110128230310.000|TR0|FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN BERLIN BUREAU 
20110128230310.000|20110128230312.000|TR0|CHIEF:  Well, it's after 1:00 a.m. in 
20110128230312.000|20110128230314.000|TR0|Cairo, Wolf.  You're absolutely right.
20110128230314.000|20110128230316.000|TR0|
20110128230316.000|20110128230318.000|TR0|But there's no sign that the curfew that 
20110128230318.000|20110128230320.000|TR0|is in place and has been in place since 
20110128230320.000|20110128230323.000|TR0|actually 6:00 p.m. is in any way being 
20110128230323.000|20110128230325.000|TR0|enforced. People are still conglomerating 
20110128230325.000|20110128230327.000|TR0|in front of Information Ministry, which we 
20110128230327.000|20110128230329.000|TR0|were talking about just a couple of 
20110128230329.000|20110128230331.000|TR0|minutes ago.
20110128230331.000|20110128230333.000|TR0|
20110128230333.000|20110128230335.000|TR0|I would say that right now If I look over 
20110128230335.000|20110128230338.000|TR0|there's still a couple hundred people 
20110128230338.000|20110128230340.000|TR0|there.  They're still chanting slogans.  
20110128230340.000|20110128230342.000|TR0|And they're clearly very, very angry at 
20110128230342.000|20110128230344.000|TR0|what they have just heard President 
20110128230344.000|20110128230346.000|TR0|Mubarak say.
20110128230346.000|20110128230348.000|TR0|
20110128230348.000|20110128230350.000|TR0|People here have been telling me that they 
20110128230350.000|20110128230352.000|TR0|would really him to take responsibility, 
20110128230352.000|20110128230355.000|TR0|that they want him to step down.  But 
20110128230355.000|20110128230357.000|TR0|essentially what he told meantime, today 
20110128230357.000|20110128230359.000|TR0|in his speech is that -- we just heard -- 
20110128230359.000|20110128230401.000|TR0|I am taking responsibility, but everyone 
20110128230401.000|20110128230403.000|TR0|else is stepping down.
20110128230403.000|20110128230405.000|TR0|
20110128230405.000|20110128230407.000|TR0|And that's clearly not what the people 
20110128230407.000|20110128230409.000|TR0|wanted to hear.  It's clearly not the case 
20110128230409.000|20110128230412.000|TR0|that they believe that there will be a new 
20110128230412.000|20110128230414.000|TR0|beginning with them or that the country 
20110128230414.000|20110128230416.000|TR0|can in any way be better with him.  The 
20110128230416.000|20110128230418.000|TR0|other thing that he said is that he wanted 
20110128230418.000|20110128230420.000|TR0|Egypt to be an open society.  Well, as you 
20110128230420.000|20110128230422.000|TR0|know, today they shut down the Internet 
20110128230422.000|20110128230424.000|TR0|here.  They shut down cell phone services 
20110128230424.000|20110128230427.000|TR0|here.
20110128230427.000|20110128230429.000|TR0|
20110128230429.000|20110128230431.000|TR0|And they obviously beat up on the 
20110128230431.000|20110128230433.000|TR0|demonstrators that were in the streets 
20110128230433.000|20110128230435.000|TR0|here.  So clearly people not buying the 
20110128230435.000|20110128230437.000|TR0|message that he just sent in his speech, 
20110128230437.000|20110128230439.000|TR0|people very, very angry.  And it's really 
20110128230439.000|20110128230441.000|TR0|something, Wolf, that they have been 
20110128230441.000|20110128230444.000|TR0|telling me throughout the day, that they 
20110128230444.000|20110128230446.000|TR0|want a new beginning, that they want 
20110128230446.000|20110128230448.000|TR0|change here in this country.
20110128230448.000|20110128230450.000|TR0|
20110128230450.000|20110128230452.000|TR0|And they were also quite frankly talking 
20110128230452.000|20110128230454.000|TR0|very much about America. They said that 
20110128230454.000|20110128230456.000|TR0|they love America.  People told me they 
20110128230456.000|20110128230459.000|TR0|really like America.  But they felt that 
20110128230459.000|20110128230501.000|TR0|America was backing the wrong horse in 
20110128230501.000|20110128230503.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak.  They say they want to make 
20110128230503.000|20110128230505.000|TR0|their own decisions.
20110128230505.000|20110128230507.000|TR0|
20110128230507.000|20110128230509.000|TR0|As you know, the movement that has been 
20110128230509.000|20110128230511.000|TR0|going on here in Egypt is not one that has 
20110128230511.000|20110128230513.000|TR0|had any religious sort of backdrop.  It's 
20110128230513.000|20110128230516.000|TR0|not an Islamist movement.  This was really 
20110128230516.000|20110128230518.000|TR0|a large swathe of the Egyptian society 
20110128230518.000|20110128230520.000|TR0|that was organizing via Twitter and 
20110128230520.000|20110128230522.000|TR0|Facebook.  And they said that quite 
20110128230522.000|20110128230524.000|TR0|frankly now they want to choose their own 
20110128230524.000|20110128230526.000|TR0|leaders without any intervention from 
20110128230526.000|20110128230528.000|TR0|anywhere else -- Wolf.

20110128230530.000|20110128230533.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Normally there are thousands and 
20110128230533.000|20110128230535.000|TR0|thousands of tourists in Cairo, elsewhere 
20110128230535.000|20110128230537.000|TR0|in Egypt.  It's a very popular place for 
20110128230537.000|20110128230539.000|TR0|European, for American tourists, for 
20110128230539.000|20110128230541.000|TR0|tourists from all over the world.  Are 
20110128230541.000|20110128230543.000|TR0|they out?  Are they still there?  What's 
20110128230543.000|20110128230545.000|TR0|going on?  How safe are these folks?
20110128230545.000|20110128230548.000|TR0|
20110128230548.000|20110128230550.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Well, many of them are still 
20110128230550.000|20110128230552.000|TR0|here.  You're absolutely right.  There's a 
20110128230552.000|20110128230554.000|TR0|lot of tourists obviously here in Cairo.  
20110128230554.000|20110128230556.000|TR0|In the area around Cairo, of course, 
20110128230556.000|20110128230558.000|TR0|there's the Pyramids.  And then if go 
20110128230558.000|20110128230600.000|TR0|further towards the east, towards the 
20110128230600.000|20110128230602.000|TR0|Sinai, you have the Red Sea and all the 
20110128230602.000|20110128230605.000|TR0|resorts there.  So yes there's millions of 
20110128230605.000|20110128230607.000|TR0|tourists if you will here in this country, 
20110128230607.000|20110128230609.000|TR0|a very popular tourist destination.
20110128230609.000|20110128230611.000|TR0|
20110128230611.000|20110128230613.000|TR0|Most of tourists are of course here.  I'm 
20110128230613.000|20110128230615.000|TR0|many of them will be trying to get out of 
20110128230615.000|20110128230617.000|TR0|the country at this point.  We don't have 
20110128230617.000|20110128230620.000|TR0|any reports that tourists have been harmed 
20110128230620.000|20110128230622.000|TR0|in any way, shape or form.  But one of the 
20110128230622.000|20110128230624.000|TR0|things that we have heard is that at least 
20110128230624.000|20110128230626.000|TR0|in some hotels the security staff there 
20110128230626.000|20110128230628.000|TR0|and police around the hotels were trying 
20110128230628.000|20110128230630.000|TR0|to confiscate cameras, you know, even 
20110128230630.000|20110128230632.000|TR0|small personal cameras from people out of 
20110128230632.000|20110128230634.000|TR0|fear that they would show what was going 
20110128230634.000|20110128230637.000|TR0|on.
20110128230637.000|20110128230639.000|TR0|
20110128230639.000|20110128230641.000|TR0|One of our crew got its camera taken away. 
20110128230641.000|20110128230643.000|TR0| Another crew that we had trying to get 
20110128230643.000|20110128230645.000|TR0|into a hotel here almost got its camera 
20110128230645.000|20110128230647.000|TR0|away.  It was a very, very close call.  So 
20110128230647.000|20110128230649.000|TR0|clearly the security forces have been 
20110128230649.000|20110128230651.000|TR0|clamping down.  And of course the tourists 
20110128230651.000|20110128230654.000|TR0|have not been spared of that.
20110128230654.000|20110128230656.000|TR0|
20110128230656.000|20110128230658.000|TR0|However, there are no reports that any of 
20110128230658.000|20110128230700.000|TR0|them have been harmed, but there are still 
20110128230700.000|20110128230702.000|TR0|-- I can tell you from the experiences 
20110128230702.000|20110128230704.000|TR0|that I have gained through the past couple 
20110128230704.000|20110128230706.000|TR0|days, there are still a lot of tourists 
20110128230706.000|20110128230709.000|TR0|both here in Cairo as well as in other 
20110128230709.000|20110128230711.000|TR0|places in Egypt.  And clearly a lot of 
20110128230711.000|20110128230713.000|TR0|them want to leave, but a lot of them 
20110128230713.000|20110128230715.000|TR0|haven't been able to leave so far, Wolf.
20110128230715.000|20110128230717.000|TR0|
20110128230717.000|20110128230719.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I have heard some reports that 
20110128230719.000|20110128230721.000|TR0|some flights, international flights in and 
20110128230721.000|20110128230723.000|TR0|out of Egypt have been canceled.  What do 
20110128230723.000|20110128230726.000|TR0|you know about that, if anything, Fred?
20110128230726.000|20110128230728.000|TR0|
20110128230728.000|20110128230730.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Well, we have sort of been 
20110128230730.000|20110128230732.000|TR0|hearing rumors from the airport.
20110128230732.000|20110128230734.000|TR0|
20110128230734.000|20110128230736.000|TR0|For a short while, there was people saying 
20110128230736.000|20110128230738.000|TR0|that the airport would be closed for 
20110128230738.000|20110128230741.000|TR0|several hours.  Some were saying 12 hours. 
20110128230741.000|20110128230743.000|TR0| Others were saying that several 
20110128230743.000|20110128230745.000|TR0|international flights had been canceled.  
20110128230745.000|20110128230747.000|TR0|It's really hard to get any confirmation 
20110128230747.000|20110128230749.000|TR0|of any of that.
20110128230749.000|20110128230751.000|TR0|
20110128230751.000|20110128230753.000|TR0|But certainly right now it seems that a 
20110128230753.000|20110128230755.000|TR0|lot of things are up in the air here.  But 
20110128230755.000|20110128230758.000|TR0|it is also the case, Wolf, that most 
20110128230758.000|20110128230800.000|TR0|things here in Egypt are still functioning 
20110128230800.000|20110128230802.000|TR0|quite well.  We have been traveling the 
20110128230802.000|20110128230804.000|TR0|country over the past couple of days and 
20110128230804.000|20110128230806.000|TR0|the ports and the airports have been 
20110128230806.000|20110128230808.000|TR0|functioning quite normally.       And it 
20110128230808.000|20110128230810.000|TR0|wouldn't surprise me if these things 
20110128230810.000|20110128230812.000|TR0|actually still kept functioning, 
20110128230812.000|20110128230815.000|TR0|especially now that at least nominally 
20110128230815.000|20110128230817.000|TR0|this government is still in place.  And 
20110128230817.000|20110128230819.000|TR0|really what we always have to take note of 
20110128230819.000|20110128230821.000|TR0|is that these protests in no way were ever 
20110128230821.000|20110128230823.000|TR0|directed at foreigners, at tourists or at 
20110128230823.000|20110128230825.000|TR0|anything else but the government.
20110128230825.000|20110128230827.000|TR0|
20110128230827.000|20110128230830.000|TR0|And they really in only very rare cases 
20110128230830.000|20110128230832.000|TR0|affected anything else but government 
20110128230832.000|20110128230834.000|TR0|institutions or been directed at 
20110128230834.000|20110128230836.000|TR0|government institutions.  So clearly, most 
20110128230836.000|20110128230838.000|TR0|of public life in Egypt, if you will, is 
20110128230838.000|20110128230840.000|TR0|still functioning, even though of course 
20110128230840.000|20110128230842.000|TR0|the people are showing this great 
20110128230842.000|20110128230844.000|TR0|discontent with their leadership hat this 
20110128230844.000|20110128230847.000|TR0|point in time, Wolf.
20110128230847.000|20110128230849.000|TR0|
20110128230849.000|20110128230851.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, stand by, Fred, 
20110128230851.000|20110128230853.000|TR0|because we're going to be checking back 
20110128230853.000|20110128230855.000|TR0|with you.

20110128230857.000|20110128230859.000|TR0|The State Department here in Washington is 
20110128230859.000|20110128230902.000|TR0|warning all Americans about the situation 
20110128230902.000|20110128230904.000|TR0|in Egypt, urging against travel there and 
20110128230904.000|20110128230906.000|TR0|is telling Americans already in Egypt to 
20110128230906.000|20110128230908.000|TR0|stay put and use caution.

20110128230923.000|20110128230925.000|TR0|STATE:  We are deeply concerned about the 
20110128230925.000|20110128230927.000|TR0|use of violence by Egyptian police and 
20110128230927.000|20110128230929.000|TR0|security forces against protesters, and we 
20110128230929.000|20110128230931.000|TR0|call on the Egyptian government to do 
20110128230931.000|20110128230933.000|TR0|everything in its power to restrain the 
20110128230933.000|20110128230936.000|TR0|security forces.
20110128230936.000|20110128230938.000|TR0|
20110128230938.000|20110128230940.000|TR0|At the same time, protesters should also 
20110128230940.000|20110128230942.000|TR0|refrain from violence and express 
20110128230942.000|20110128230944.000|TR0|themselves peacefully.
20110128230944.000|20110128230946.000|TR0|
20110128230946.000|20110128230948.000|TR0|The Egyptian government has a real 
20110128230948.000|20110128230951.000|TR0|opportunity in the face of this very clear 
20110128230951.000|20110128230953.000|TR0|demonstration of opposition to begin a 
20110128230953.000|20110128230955.000|TR0|process that will truly respond to the 
20110128230955.000|20110128230957.000|TR0|aspirations of the people of Egypt.  We 
20110128230957.000|20110128230959.000|TR0|think that moment needs to be seized and 
20110128230959.000|20110128231001.000|TR0|we are hoping that it is.

20110128231010.000|20110128231012.000|TR0|national security analyst Peter Bergen, 
20110128231012.000|20110128231014.000|TR0|along with journalist and author Robin 
20110128231014.000|20110128231016.000|TR0|Wright. She's covered the Middle East for 
20110128231016.000|20110128231018.000|TR0|a long time.  We're going to continue 
20110128231018.000|20110128231020.000|TR0|showing our viewers these dramatic live 
20110128231020.000|20110128231023.000|TR0|pictures, some taped pictures of what's 
20110128231023.000|20110128231025.000|TR0|been happening in Cairo, Alexander, Suez, 
20110128231025.000|20110128231027.000|TR0|elsewhere in Egypt.

20110128231029.000|20110128231031.000|TR0|But we just heard a little while ago from 
20110128231031.000|20110128231033.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak defiantly saying, you know 
20110128231033.000|20110128231035.000|TR0|what, I'm in charge.  I will have a new 
20110128231035.000|20110128231037.000|TR0|government tomorrow.  But there has to be 
20110128231037.000|20110128231040.000|TR0|law and order.

20110128231050.000|20110128231052.000|TR0|continue to see protests.       The fact 
20110128231052.000|20110128231054.000|TR0|is President Mubarak did the same thing 
20110128231054.000|20110128231057.000|TR0|that President Ben Ali did in Tunisia.  
20110128231057.000|20110128231059.000|TR0|Very -- at the end of the day, he had to 
20110128231059.000|20110128231101.000|TR0|say, look, there have been problems.  I'm 
20110128231101.000|20110128231103.000|TR0|going to fire the government and we're 
20110128231103.000|20110128231105.000|TR0|going to start anew.
20110128231105.000|20110128231107.000|TR0|
20110128231107.000|20110128231109.000|TR0|And it's too late to do that.  The status 
20110128231109.000|20110128231112.000|TR0|quo in Egypt is finished.  From now on, 
20110128231112.000|20110128231114.000|TR0|you either have to see dramatic change or 
20110128231114.000|20110128231116.000|TR0|this marks the beginning of the end of the 
20110128231116.000|20110128231118.000|TR0|Mubarak...
20110128231118.000|20110128231120.000|TR0|
20110128231120.000|20110128231122.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Even if the military stays loyal 
20110128231122.000|20110128231124.000|TR0|to Mubarak?
20110128231124.000|20110128231126.000|TR0|
20110128231126.000|20110128231129.000|TR0|WRIGHT:  The military is different from 
20110128231129.000|20110128231131.000|TR0|the security forces.  The military has a 
20110128231131.000|20110128231133.000|TR0|long history of being from the people.  
20110128231133.000|20110128231135.000|TR0|And they are seen as heroes.  The security 
20110128231135.000|20110128231137.000|TR0|forces are seen as the instrument of the 
20110128231137.000|20110128231139.000|TR0|regime in clamping down on opposition.
20110128231139.000|20110128231141.000|TR0|
20110128231141.000|20110128231144.000|TR0|And I think the military has deployed in 
20110128231144.000|20110128231146.000|TR0|the streets but it has not yet fired at 
20110128231146.000|20110128231148.000|TR0|the people.  And that will be what is the 
20110128231148.000|20110128231150.000|TR0|key in the days ahead, if they side with 
20110128231150.000|20110128231152.000|TR0|Mubarak and try to clamp down on the 
20110128231152.000|20110128231154.000|TR0|unrest or if they refuse to fire.
20110128231154.000|20110128231156.000|TR0|
20110128231156.000|20110128231158.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is it only a matter of time, 
20110128231158.000|20110128231201.000|TR0|days maybe, that Mubarak is forced out?
20110128231201.000|20110128231203.000|TR0|
20110128231203.000|20110128231205.000|TR0|PETER BERGEN, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST:  Yes, 
20110128231205.000|20110128231207.000|TR0|I Mean, revolutionaries are inherently 
20110128231207.000|20110128231209.000|TR0|revolutionary and very difficult to 
20110128231209.000|20110128231211.000|TR0|predict.
20110128231211.000|20110128231213.000|TR0|
20110128231213.000|20110128231215.000|TR0|And it would have been hard to predict, 
20110128231215.000|20110128231218.000|TR0|for instance, that Ceausescu would fall so 
20110128231218.000|20110128231220.000|TR0|quickly if you had gone back a month 
20110128231220.000|20110128231222.000|TR0|before.
20110128231222.000|20110128231224.000|TR0|
20110128231224.000|20110128231226.000|TR0|BLITZER:  In Romania.
20110128231226.000|20110128231228.000|TR0|
20110128231228.000|20110128231230.000|TR0|BERGEN:  In Romania.
20110128231230.000|20110128231233.000|TR0|
20110128231233.000|20110128231235.000|TR0|Just as the 1979 revolution spread like a 
20110128231235.000|20110128231237.000|TR0|contagion, we're seeing some of that in 
20110128231237.000|20110128231239.000|TR0|the Middle East.  In fact, we saw that in 
20110128231239.000|20110128231241.000|TR0|1848 in Europe, where you had a similar 
20110128231241.000|20110128231243.000|TR0|kind of mirroring effect in different 
20110128231243.000|20110128231245.000|TR0|countries.  But Mubarak, he's been a 
20110128231245.000|20110128231247.000|TR0|survivor.  I think to count him out 
20110128231247.000|20110128231250.000|TR0|immediately I think would be premature.
20110128231250.000|20110128231252.000|TR0|
20110128231252.000|20110128231254.000|TR0|As Robin indicated, it's not really clear 
20110128231254.000|20110128231256.000|TR0|where the military stands right now.  In 
20110128231256.000|20110128231258.000|TR0|Egypt, when you travel there, the people 
20110128231258.000|20110128231300.000|TR0|like the military.  They don't criticize 
20110128231300.000|20110128231302.000|TR0|the military.  So clearly whatever the 
20110128231302.000|20110128231305.000|TR0|military decides is what will probably 
20110128231305.000|20110128231307.000|TR0|happen.
20110128231307.000|20110128231309.000|TR0|
20110128231309.000|20110128231311.000|TR0|And the worst thing that a regime can do 
20110128231311.000|20110128231313.000|TR0|-- if the military starts shooting, then 
20110128231313.000|20110128231315.000|TR0|we know the answer.  If they don't shoot, 
20110128231315.000|20110128231317.000|TR0|then there's the other answer.
20110128231317.000|20110128231319.000|TR0|
20110128231319.000|20110128231322.000|TR0|WRIGHT:  But the U.S. -- but the Mubarak 
20110128231322.000|20110128231324.000|TR0|regime has lost not only the support of 
20110128231324.000|20110128231326.000|TR0|its own people.  It's losing the support 
20110128231326.000|20110128231328.000|TR0|of its allies.
20110128231328.000|20110128231330.000|TR0|
20110128231330.000|20110128231332.000|TR0|And the statement both out of the White 
20110128231332.000|20110128231334.000|TR0|House and the State Department today was 
20110128231334.000|20110128231336.000|TR0|really very stunning, saying that these 
20110128231336.000|20110128231339.000|TR0|grievances must be addressed immediately, 
20110128231339.000|20110128231341.000|TR0|that the government can't use restraint 
20110128231341.000|20110128231343.000|TR0|against its people, that it had to give 
20110128231343.000|20110128231345.000|TR0|freedom of the press and the restore the 
20110128231345.000|20110128231347.000|TR0|instruments that have allowed these people 
20110128231347.000|20110128231349.000|TR0|to mobilize.
20110128231349.000|20110128231351.000|TR0|
20110128231351.000|20110128231354.000|TR0|This is why with the economic problems 
20110128231354.000|20110128231356.000|TR0|Egypt faces, with tourism, which it 
20110128231356.000|20110128231358.000|TR0|depends on, with airlines now saying 
20110128231358.000|20110128231400.000|TR0|they're not going to fly in and with the 
20110128231400.000|20110128231402.000|TR0|stock market beginning to go down in the 
20110128231402.000|20110128231404.000|TR0|run-up to these protests, that there are a 
20110128231404.000|20110128231406.000|TR0|lot of other factors that will come into 
20110128231406.000|20110128231408.000|TR0|play as well.
20110128231408.000|20110128231411.000|TR0|
20110128231411.000|20110128231413.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And, quickly, Peter, the key 
20110128231413.000|20110128231415.000|TR0|question is, if Mubarak goes down, who 
20110128231415.000|20110128231417.000|TR0|replaces him?
20110128231417.000|20110128231419.000|TR0|
20110128231419.000|20110128231421.000|TR0|BERGEN:  Well, he's made it -- his whole 
20110128231421.000|20110128231423.000|TR0|career to make sure that there is not 
20110128231423.000|20110128231426.000|TR0|anybody...
20110128231426.000|20110128231428.000|TR0|
20110128231428.000|20110128231430.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110128231430.000|20110128231432.000|TR0|
20110128231432.000|20110128231434.000|TR0|BLITZER:  He wanted his son Gamal, but 
20110128231434.000|20110128231436.000|TR0|we're now told he's out of the country, as 
20110128231436.000|20110128231438.000|TR0|is Mubarak's wife, maybe in London.  We're 
20110128231438.000|20110128231440.000|TR0|not sure about that.  But those are the 
20110128231440.000|20110128231443.000|TR0|widespread reports out there.
20110128231443.000|20110128231445.000|TR0|
20110128231445.000|20110128231447.000|TR0|BERGEN:  Obviously, Gamal will no longer 
20110128231447.000|20110128231449.000|TR0|become the president of Egypt, as was the 
20110128231449.000|20110128231451.000|TR0|plan.  The Muslim Brotherhood obviously 
20110128231451.000|20110128231453.000|TR0|has a role to play.  If there were 
20110128231453.000|20110128231455.000|TR0|elections tomorrow, they would do pretty 
20110128231455.000|20110128231457.000|TR0|well, maybe get a third of the vote.  
20110128231457.000|20110128231500.000|TR0|They're the largest force politically 
20110128231500.000|20110128231502.000|TR0|organized.  There are smaller liberal 
20110128231502.000|20110128231504.000|TR0|secular parties, but they don't have 
20110128231504.000|20110128231506.000|TR0|anything of the same pull as the Muslim 
20110128231506.000|20110128231508.000|TR0|Brotherhood.
20110128231508.000|20110128231510.000|TR0|
20110128231510.000|20110128231512.000|TR0|BLITZER:  What do you think, Robin?
20110128231512.000|20110128231515.000|TR0|
20110128231515.000|20110128231517.000|TR0|WRIGHT:  I don't think the Muslim 
20110128231517.000|20110128231519.000|TR0|Brotherhood is a player.
20110128231519.000|20110128231521.000|TR0|

20110128231525.000|20110128231527.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is not a player?
20110128231527.000|20110128231529.000|TR0|
20110128231529.000|20110128231532.000|TR0|WRIGHT:  Not a player in terms of who 
20110128231532.000|20110128231534.000|TR0|fills the vacuum.  They do have only about 
20110128231534.000|20110128231536.000|TR0|a third maximum of the support of the 
20110128231536.000|20110128231538.000|TR0|people.
20110128231538.000|20110128231540.000|TR0|
20110128231540.000|20110128231542.000|TR0|And what so striking about all these 
20110128231542.000|20110128231544.000|TR0|upheavals is that they're non-ideological 
20110128231544.000|20110128231547.000|TR0|and that the traditional opposition 
20110128231547.000|20110128231549.000|TR0|groups, be they secular or religious, have 
20110128231549.000|20110128231551.000|TR0|attached themselves onto this body of 
20110128231551.000|20110128231553.000|TR0|people after the fact, after they 
20110128231553.000|20110128231555.000|TR0|initiated it.

20110128231644.000|20110128231646.000|TR0|BLITZER:  These were the scenes earlier in 
20110128231646.000|20110128231648.000|TR0|the day in Cairo. Today, similar scenes in 
20110128231648.000|20110128231650.000|TR0|Alexandria and Suez.

20110128231653.000|20110128231655.000|TR0|Elsewhere in Egypt, the protests 
20110128231655.000|20110128231657.000|TR0|escalating, the hatred of the Egyptian 
20110128231657.000|20110128231659.000|TR0|president evident by these protesters, 
20110128231659.000|20110128231701.000|TR0|thousands of them taking to the streets.

20110128231703.000|20110128231705.000|TR0|The White House reaction to the breaking 
20110128231705.000|20110128231708.000|TR0|news in Egypt, a senior administration 
20110128231708.000|20110128231710.000|TR0|official reacting to President Mubarak's 
20110128231710.000|20110128231712.000|TR0|speech just a little while ago calling it 
20110128231712.000|20110128231714.000|TR0|-- and I'm quoting now -- "hardly 
20110128231714.000|20110128231716.000|TR0|conciliatory and highly disappointing," 
20110128231716.000|20110128231718.000|TR0|that from a senior U.S. official.  The 
20110128231718.000|20110128231720.000|TR0|official adding, "It's clear Mubarak 
20110128231720.000|20110128231722.000|TR0|thinks he can ride this out" and says -- 
20110128231722.000|20110128231725.000|TR0|quote -- "We're not so sure that is the 
20110128231725.000|20110128231727.000|TR0|right assumption" -- blunt talk from a 
20110128231727.000|20110128231729.000|TR0|senior Obama administration official.

20110128231731.000|20110128231733.000|TR0|Let's get some more now on the political 
20110128231733.000|20110128231735.000|TR0|implications of all of this.
20110128231735.000|20110128231737.000|TR0|
20110128231737.000|20110128231739.000|TR0|Our chief political correspondent Candy 
20110128231739.000|20110128231742.000|TR0|Crowley is here in THE SITUATION ROOM.
20110128231742.000|20110128231744.000|TR0|
20110128231744.000|20110128231746.000|TR0|Candy, I will play a little clip of what 
20110128231746.000|20110128231748.000|TR0|the president said in Cairo, that big 
20110128231748.000|20110128231750.000|TR0|speech he gave back in June of 2009.  
20110128231750.000|20110128231752.000|TR0|Listen to this.
20110128231752.000|20110128231754.000|TR0|
20110128231754.000|20110128231757.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, JUNE 4, 2009)
20110128231757.000|20110128231759.000|TR0|
20110128231759.000|20110128231801.000|TR0|OBAMA:  So no matter where it takes hold, 
20110128231801.000|20110128231803.000|TR0|government of the people and by the 
20110128231803.000|20110128231805.000|TR0|people, sets a single standard for all who 
20110128231805.000|20110128231807.000|TR0|would hold power.  You must maintain power 
20110128231807.000|20110128231809.000|TR0|through consent, not coercion.
20110128231809.000|20110128231811.000|TR0|
20110128231811.000|20110128231814.000|TR0|You must respect the rights of minorities 
20110128231814.000|20110128231816.000|TR0|and participate with a spirit of tolerance 
20110128231816.000|20110128231818.000|TR0|and compromise.  You must place the 
20110128231818.000|20110128231820.000|TR0|interests of your people and the 
20110128231820.000|20110128231822.000|TR0|legitimate workings of the political 
20110128231822.000|20110128231824.000|TR0|process above your party.  Without these 
20110128231824.000|20110128231826.000|TR0|ingredients, elections alone do not make 
20110128231826.000|20110128231829.000|TR0|true democracies.

20110128231835.000|20110128231837.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So some people are looking at 
20110128231837.000|20110128231839.000|TR0|that speech, Candy, and saying, you know 
20110128231839.000|20110128231841.000|TR0|what, he may have planted a seed as to 
20110128231841.000|20110128231843.000|TR0|what's going on right now.
20110128231843.000|20110128231846.000|TR0|
20110128231846.000|20110128231848.000|TR0|CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110128231848.000|20110128231850.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, he certainly grabbed 
20110128231850.000|20110128231852.000|TR0|hold of what was going on there, because 
20110128231852.000|20110128231854.000|TR0|this is not particularly new.
20110128231854.000|20110128231856.000|TR0|
20110128231856.000|20110128231858.000|TR0|Obviously, the level of it is.  But we 
20110128231858.000|20110128231900.000|TR0|have long known that there was unrest in 
20110128231900.000|20110128231903.000|TR0|Egypt, because this is an authoritarian, 
20110128231903.000|20110128231905.000|TR0|very often repressive government.  And 
20110128231905.000|20110128231907.000|TR0|remember that the president had in that 
20110128231907.000|20110128231909.000|TR0|room with him dissidents.  They had 
20110128231909.000|20110128231911.000|TR0|invited in members of Labor.  They had 
20110128231911.000|20110128231913.000|TR0|invited in members of the Brotherhood of 
20110128231913.000|20110128231915.000|TR0|Muslims.       So they were quite aware of 
20110128231915.000|20110128231918.000|TR0|what was going on, and they were speaking 
20110128231918.000|20110128231920.000|TR0|to two different places.  They were 
20110128231920.000|20110128231922.000|TR0|speaking to the street and they were 
20110128231922.000|20110128231924.000|TR0|speaking to the halls of power in Cairo.  
20110128231924.000|20110128231926.000|TR0|So it wasn't exactly prescient, but it 
20110128231926.000|20110128231928.000|TR0|certainly did frame what was going on in 
20110128231928.000|20110128231930.000|TR0|Cairo at that time and what is going on 
20110128231930.000|20110128231932.000|TR0|quite visibly right now.
20110128231932.000|20110128231935.000|TR0|
20110128231935.000|20110128231937.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We're expecting, by the way, 
20110128231937.000|20110128231939.000|TR0|President Obama to be making a statement 
20110128231939.000|20110128231941.000|TR0|momentarily.  We have just been told by 
20110128231941.000|20110128231943.000|TR0|the White House that the president will 
20110128231943.000|20110128231945.000|TR0|speak on this very crisis right now within 
20110128231945.000|20110128231947.000|TR0|the next five minutes or so.  We expect to 
20110128231947.000|20110128231950.000|TR0|hear from the president so we will of 
20110128231950.000|20110128231952.000|TR0|course bring that to our viewers here in 
20110128231952.000|20110128231954.000|TR0|the United States and around the world.
20110128231954.000|20110128231956.000|TR0|
20110128231956.000|20110128231958.000|TR0|We will get his reaction to what is going 
20110128231958.000|20110128232000.000|TR0|on.  It sort of reminds me, and you 
20110128232000.000|20110128232002.000|TR0|remember this well, during the political 
20110128232002.000|20110128232004.000|TR0|campaign in 2008, when Hillary Clinton was 
20110128232004.000|20110128232007.000|TR0|running for the Democratic nomination.  
20110128232007.000|20110128232009.000|TR0|She wondered about that 3:00 a.m. phone 
20110128232009.000|20110128232011.000|TR0|call.  Who do you want to be taking that 
20110128232011.000|20110128232013.000|TR0|phone call?
20110128232013.000|20110128232015.000|TR0|
20110128232015.000|20110128232017.000|TR0|This is one of those game changers in the 
20110128232017.000|20110128232019.000|TR0|world right now, potentially, what is 
20110128232019.000|20110128232021.000|TR0|going on in Egypt.
20110128232021.000|20110128232024.000|TR0|
20110128232024.000|20110128232026.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  In the world, yes, and less 
20110128232026.000|20110128232028.000|TR0|about internal U.S. politics more about 
20110128232028.000|20110128232030.000|TR0|global politics, because, look, this is a 
20110128232030.000|20110128232032.000|TR0|problem in Egypt and in other countries, 
20110128232032.000|20110128232034.000|TR0|Jordan, Saudi Arabia.
20110128232034.000|20110128232036.000|TR0|
20110128232036.000|20110128232039.000|TR0|You have these leaders who are not exactly 
20110128232039.000|20110128232041.000|TR0|bastions of democracy, but who nonetheless 
20110128232041.000|20110128232043.000|TR0|are helpful to the United States.  Hosni 
20110128232043.000|20110128232045.000|TR0|Mubarak has kept a cold peace with Israel 
20110128232045.000|20110128232047.000|TR0|for decades.  He has been the conduit 
20110128232047.000|20110128232049.000|TR0|through which we talk to other less 
20110128232049.000|20110128232051.000|TR0|friendly Arab nations.  He has also been 
20110128232051.000|20110128232053.000|TR0|helpful in the war on terrorism.
20110128232053.000|20110128232056.000|TR0|
20110128232056.000|20110128232058.000|TR0|So you make a deal with who can help you 
20110128232058.000|20110128232100.000|TR0|and who can protect the United States.  
20110128232100.000|20110128232102.000|TR0|And for decades, that has been Hosni 
20110128232102.000|20110128232104.000|TR0|Mubarak.  Now, when you see these sort of 
20110128232104.000|20110128232106.000|TR0|things in the street, and you understand 
20110128232106.000|20110128232108.000|TR0|that these passions that you have known 
20110128232108.000|20110128232111.000|TR0|were simmering have now boiled over, you 
20110128232111.000|20110128232113.000|TR0|pretty much have to look at what will be a 
20110128232113.000|20110128232115.000|TR0|new reality in Egypt.
20110128232115.000|20110128232117.000|TR0|
20110128232117.000|20110128232119.000|TR0|And what are you going to -- who is next?  
20110128232119.000|20110128232121.000|TR0|And that's really the big question, 
20110128232121.000|20110128232123.000|TR0|because if Hosni Mubarak goes, who then 
20110128232123.000|20110128232125.000|TR0|comes in, and who can play that role?  
20110128232125.000|20110128232128.000|TR0|And, look, Egypt has also been very strong 
20110128232128.000|20110128232130.000|TR0|anti-Iran.  So I imagine that there's 
20110128232130.000|20110128232132.000|TR0|probably no one happier at this point than 
20110128232132.000|20110128232134.000|TR0|the leadership in Iran looking at what's 
20110128232134.000|20110128232136.000|TR0|going on.
20110128232136.000|20110128232138.000|TR0|
20110128232138.000|20110128232140.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And we're waiting for president 
20110128232140.000|20110128232142.000|TR0|of the United States to speak.  This is a 
20110128232142.000|20110128232145.000|TR0|serious moment for the president of the 
20110128232145.000|20110128232147.000|TR0|United States to show leadership.
20110128232147.000|20110128232149.000|TR0|
20110128232149.000|20110128232151.000|TR0|But I suspect that a lot of U.S. officials 
20110128232151.000|20110128232153.000|TR0|think it also underscores the limits of 
20110128232153.000|20110128232155.000|TR0|U.S. power, how much influence the United 
20110128232155.000|20110128232157.000|TR0|States can have in affecting what happens 
20110128232157.000|20110128232200.000|TR0|on the streets of the major cities of 
20110128232200.000|20110128232202.000|TR0|Egypt.
20110128232202.000|20110128232204.000|TR0|
20110128232204.000|20110128232206.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  Exactly.       And I think 
20110128232206.000|20110128232208.000|TR0|that's why you have seen -- everyone say, 
20110128232208.000|20110128232210.000|TR0|well, why hasn't the president spoken so 
20110128232210.000|20110128232212.000|TR0|far?  This has been going on for a couple 
20110128232212.000|20110128232214.000|TR0|days.  Because you have got to wait and 
20110128232214.000|20110128232217.000|TR0|see what happens.  You cannot control 
20110128232217.000|20110128232219.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak and you cannot control 
20110128232219.000|20110128232221.000|TR0|what's going on in the streets of Cairo 
20110128232221.000|20110128232223.000|TR0|and Alexandria and elsewhere.
20110128232223.000|20110128232225.000|TR0|
20110128232225.000|20110128232227.000|TR0|So, the fact of the matter is the U.S. has 
20110128232227.000|20110128232229.000|TR0|to maneuver around what's happening, 
20110128232229.000|20110128232232.000|TR0|because it really can't shape what's 
20110128232232.000|20110128232234.000|TR0|happening. Certainly it sent messages to 
20110128232234.000|20110128232236.000|TR0|Mubarak over the course of the last couple 
20110128232236.000|20110128232238.000|TR0|of days about let this remain peaceful and 
20110128232238.000|20110128232240.000|TR0|that kind of thing.
20110128232240.000|20110128232242.000|TR0|
20110128232242.000|20110128232244.000|TR0|But the fact of the matter is that you 
20110128232244.000|20110128232246.000|TR0|cannot control the kind of passion that 
20110128232246.000|20110128232249.000|TR0|you're seeing now.  You have got to try to 
20110128232249.000|20110128232251.000|TR0|shape it, so that on the other end of it, 
20110128232251.000|20110128232253.000|TR0|the U.S. comes out in a palatable position.
20110128232253.000|20110128232255.000|TR0|
20110128232255.000|20110128232257.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And President Mubarak was at the 
20110128232257.000|20110128232259.000|TR0|White House not that long ago, a few 
20110128232259.000|20110128232301.000|TR0|months ago.  And they had what U.S. 
20110128232301.000|20110128232303.000|TR0|officials described as very good meetings, 
20110128232303.000|20110128232306.000|TR0|but obviously not necessarily perfect 
20110128232306.000|20110128232308.000|TR0|meetings.
20110128232308.000|20110128232310.000|TR0|
20110128232310.000|20110128232312.000|TR0|Some analysts have suggested this is 
20110128232312.000|20110128232314.000|TR0|similar to what happened in Iran in '79.  
20110128232314.000|20110128232316.000|TR0|The shah of Iran was a close U.S. ally, 
20110128232316.000|20110128232318.000|TR0|but flawed.  And a lot of people in Iran 
20110128232318.000|20110128232321.000|TR0|did not like him.  And of course he was 
20110128232321.000|20110128232323.000|TR0|overthrown.  There was a revolution.  We 
20110128232323.000|20110128232325.000|TR0|know what happened then.  And it became 
20110128232325.000|20110128232327.000|TR0|very, very obvious.
20110128232327.000|20110128232329.000|TR0|
20110128232329.000|20110128232331.000|TR0|But as the shah was, from the U.S. 
20110128232331.000|20110128232333.000|TR0|perspective, what followed was even worse, 
20110128232333.000|20110128232335.000|TR0|decades of leadership by the ayatollahs in 
20110128232335.000|20110128232338.000|TR0|Iran.  And some U.S. officials have said 
20110128232338.000|20110128232340.000|TR0|to me over the past few days they're 
20110128232340.000|20110128232342.000|TR0|deeply worried.  As flawed as Mubarak is, 
20110128232342.000|20110128232344.000|TR0|they don't know what will happen next.
20110128232344.000|20110128232346.000|TR0|
20110128232346.000|20110128232348.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  Sure.  It's the what if 
20110128232348.000|20110128232350.000|TR0|question.  What if the U.S. had interfered 
20110128232350.000|20110128232353.000|TR0|more?  What if the U.S. had pumped up the 
20110128232353.000|20110128232355.000|TR0|shah and said, yes, take to the streets, 
20110128232355.000|20110128232357.000|TR0|force this revolution back?  Would we be 
20110128232357.000|20110128232359.000|TR0|dealing with the Iran we're dealing with 
20110128232359.000|20110128232401.000|TR0|now?
20110128232401.000|20110128232403.000|TR0|
20110128232403.000|20110128232405.000|TR0|Well, the fact of the matter is, you know, 
20110128232405.000|20110128232407.000|TR0|the world isn't made up of what ifs.  It's 
20110128232407.000|20110128232410.000|TR0|made of what did you do then.  But you're 
20110128232410.000|20110128232412.000|TR0|right. I have heard that from more than 
20110128232412.000|20110128232414.000|TR0|one person today saying, boy, this just 
20110128232414.000|20110128232416.000|TR0|reminds me of what went on in Iran.  What 
20110128232416.000|20110128232418.000|TR0|are we going to get next?  And that's what 
20110128232418.000|20110128232420.000|TR0|they're talking about at the White House.
20110128232420.000|20110128232422.000|TR0|
20110128232422.000|20110128232424.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110128232424.000|20110128232427.000|TR0|
20110128232427.000|20110128232429.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Fran Townsend, our homeland 
20110128232429.000|20110128232431.000|TR0|security contributor, is here as well, 
20110128232431.000|20110128232433.000|TR0|former homeland security adviser to 
20110128232433.000|20110128232435.000|TR0|President Bush.
20110128232435.000|20110128232437.000|TR0|
20110128232437.000|20110128232439.000|TR0|We're standing by, the president.  You can 
20110128232439.000|20110128232442.000|TR0|see the live picture over there.  He will 
20110128232442.000|20110128232444.000|TR0|be speaking from the White House 
20110128232444.000|20110128232446.000|TR0|momentarily.  We will get his reaction to 
20110128232446.000|20110128232448.000|TR0|President Mubarak's speech to the nation 
20110128232448.000|20110128232450.000|TR0|just a little while ago and what's going 
20110128232450.000|20110128232452.000|TR0|on, what is next for the U.S.
20110128232452.000|20110128232454.000|TR0|
20110128232454.000|20110128232456.000|TR0|But take us behind the scenes.  You served 
20110128232456.000|20110128232459.000|TR0|in the White House for many years.  This 
20110128232459.000|20110128232501.000|TR0|is one of those really, really delicate 
20110128232501.000|20110128232503.000|TR0|moments.       FRANCES TOWNSEND, CNN 
20110128232503.000|20110128232505.000|TR0|NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR:  That's 
20110128232505.000|20110128232507.000|TR0|right.
20110128232507.000|20110128232509.000|TR0|
20110128232509.000|20110128232511.000|TR0|There's enormous pressure on the 
20110128232511.000|20110128232514.000|TR0|president.  What people don't understand, 
20110128232514.000|20110128232516.000|TR0|whether we're talking Egypt or Pakistan, 
20110128232516.000|20110128232518.000|TR0|we have these allies who we give 
20110128232518.000|20110128232520.000|TR0|tremendous amounts of military and foreign 
20110128232520.000|20110128232522.000|TR0|aid to. But they don't always do what we 
20110128232522.000|20110128232524.000|TR0|want them to do.
20110128232524.000|20110128232526.000|TR0|
20110128232526.000|20110128232528.000|TR0|And the answer is but they do some of the 
20110128232528.000|20110128232531.000|TR0|really important things for us.  And when 
20110128232531.000|20110128232533.000|TR0|a president is confronted with a dictator 
20110128232533.000|20110128232535.000|TR0|who he may not agree with on human rights 
20110128232535.000|20110128232537.000|TR0|policy or political and democratic 
20110128232537.000|20110128232539.000|TR0|freedoms, but helps us protect the 
20110128232539.000|20110128232541.000|TR0|American people in the war on terror, he 
20110128232541.000|20110128232543.000|TR0|makes compromises.
20110128232543.000|20110128232545.000|TR0|
20110128232545.000|20110128232548.000|TR0|And they will measure their words very 
20110128232548.000|20110128232550.000|TR0|carefully here.  The fact that President 
20110128232550.000|20110128232552.000|TR0|Obama has not called President Mubarak 
20110128232552.000|20110128232554.000|TR0|speaks volumes. And that message will not 
20110128232554.000|20110128232556.000|TR0|be lost in Egypt.  The fact that President 
20110128232556.000|20110128232558.000|TR0|Mubarak has called out the army and how 
20110128232558.000|20110128232600.000|TR0|they will react now in this near term 
20110128232600.000|20110128232603.000|TR0|after his speech will also be very 
20110128232603.000|20110128232605.000|TR0|important.
20110128232605.000|20110128232607.000|TR0|
20110128232607.000|20110128232609.000|TR0|And the president, they will be measuring 
20110128232609.000|20110128232611.000|TR0|right now very carefully the words the 
20110128232611.000|20110128232613.000|TR0|president chooses to use.  It's one thing 
20110128232613.000|20110128232615.000|TR0|when the secretary of state comes out.  
20110128232615.000|20110128232617.000|TR0|It's another thing when the president of 
20110128232617.000|20110128232620.000|TR0|the United States comes out.
20110128232620.000|20110128232622.000|TR0|
20110128232622.000|20110128232624.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes, the whole world will be 
20110128232624.000|20110128232626.000|TR0|watching.  The world was watching 
20110128232626.000|20110128232628.000|TR0|President Mubarak.  Certainly the people 
20110128232628.000|20110128232630.000|TR0|of Egypt were when he spoke shortly after 
20110128232630.000|20110128232632.000|TR0|midnight local time in Cairo, in 
20110128232632.000|20110128232635.000|TR0|Alexandria. And now we're getting ready, 
20110128232635.000|20110128232637.000|TR0|we're told momentarily, for the president 
20110128232637.000|20110128232639.000|TR0|of the United States to address the U.S. 
20110128232639.000|20110128232641.000|TR0|nation, indeed the world on what's going 
20110128232641.000|20110128232643.000|TR0|on.
20110128232643.000|20110128232645.000|TR0|
20110128232645.000|20110128232647.000|TR0|Let me bring in Fred Pleitgen, who is 
20110128232647.000|20110128232649.000|TR0|watching all of this unfold.
20110128232649.000|20110128232652.000|TR0|
20110128232652.000|20110128232654.000|TR0|It's now approaching 1:30 a.m. in Cairo.  
20110128232654.000|20110128232656.000|TR0|Fred, tell our viewers if the 
20110128232656.000|20110128232658.000|TR0|demonstrations outside your window where 
20110128232658.000|20110128232700.000|TR0|you're based are continuing or if it's 
20110128232700.000|20110128232702.000|TR0|quieted down.
20110128232702.000|20110128232704.000|TR0|
20110128232704.000|20110128232706.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  They are still continuing, 
20110128232706.000|20110128232709.000|TR0|Wolf, but they're not quite as large as 
20110128232709.000|20110128232711.000|TR0|they were last time we spoke.  It seems 
20110128232711.000|20110128232713.000|TR0|that people are dispersing a little bit at 
20110128232713.000|20110128232715.000|TR0|least.
20110128232715.000|20110128232717.000|TR0|
20110128232717.000|20110128232719.000|TR0|And one of the things that you can always 
20110128232719.000|20110128232721.000|TR0|see here in these demonstrations, that 
20110128232721.000|20110128232724.000|TR0|people will come somewhere, but once the 
20110128232724.000|20110128232726.000|TR0|military shows up, it does tend to diffuse 
20110128232726.000|20110128232728.000|TR0|the situation quite quickly, because the 
20110128232728.000|20110128232730.000|TR0|military is an institution that just has 
20110128232730.000|20110128232732.000|TR0|so much respect here among the people.
20110128232732.000|20110128232734.000|TR0|
20110128232734.000|20110128232736.000|TR0|And it was very interesting to see when 
20110128232736.000|20110128232738.000|TR0|the military sort of rolled in here 
20110128232738.000|20110128232741.000|TR0|earlier today.  They were being celebrated 
20110128232741.000|20110128232743.000|TR0|by the people.  And the people were 
20110128232743.000|20110128232745.000|TR0|chanting the people and the military, we 
20110128232745.000|20110128232747.000|TR0|are one.  So, certainly, this is a much 
20110128232747.000|20110128232749.000|TR0|more respected institution than the other 
20110128232749.000|20110128232751.000|TR0|security forces, especially of course the 
20110128232751.000|20110128232753.000|TR0|police here in Egypt.       But there are 
20110128232753.000|20110128232756.000|TR0|still people here on the streets.  They 
20110128232756.000|20110128232758.000|TR0|are still quite angry of course at what 
20110128232758.000|20110128232800.000|TR0|they have heard from President Hosni 
20110128232800.000|20110128232802.000|TR0|Mubarak.  And I can tell you that there 
20110128232802.000|20110128232804.000|TR0|will be a lot of Egyptians also waiting to 
20110128232804.000|20110128232806.000|TR0|hear what the U.S. president has to say 
20110128232806.000|20110128232808.000|TR0|about the situation, because that's one of 
20110128232808.000|20110128232810.000|TR0|the things that people keep telling me 
20110128232810.000|20110128232813.000|TR0|again and again and asking me again and 
20110128232813.000|20110128232815.000|TR0|again is what is the American president 
20110128232815.000|20110128232817.000|TR0|saying about this?  What is America saying 
20110128232817.000|20110128232819.000|TR0|about all this?
20110128232819.000|20110128232821.000|TR0|
20110128232821.000|20110128232823.000|TR0|Clearly they want to know where America 
20110128232823.000|20110128232825.000|TR0|stands, because they believe it will be 
20110128232825.000|20110128232827.000|TR0|very, very important to their future -- 
20110128232827.000|20110128232830.000|TR0|Wolf.
20110128232830.000|20110128232832.000|TR0|
20110128232832.000|20110128232834.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Fred, I know that they have 
20110128232834.000|20110128232836.000|TR0|really shut down effectively much of the 
20110128232836.000|20110128232838.000|TR0|Internet and the social networking sites 
20110128232838.000|20110128232840.000|TR0|like Twitter and Facebook.  But what about 
20110128232840.000|20110128232842.000|TR0|television?  Is Egyptian state television 
20110128232842.000|20110128232845.000|TR0|showing any of this to the people there?  
20110128232845.000|20110128232847.000|TR0|I assume that folks can still get 
20110128232847.000|20110128232849.000|TR0|Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya, and CNN 
20110128232849.000|20110128232851.000|TR0|International.
20110128232851.000|20110128232853.000|TR0|
20110128232853.000|20110128232855.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Yes.  Obviously, we're all 
20110128232855.000|20110128232857.000|TR0|showing it.
20110128232857.000|20110128232859.000|TR0|
20110128232859.000|20110128232902.000|TR0|But, yes, it was quite interesting to see 
20110128232902.000|20110128232904.000|TR0|that.  Yes, Egyptian state television also 
20110128232904.000|20110128232906.000|TR0|did show that the protests were going on.  
20110128232906.000|20110128232908.000|TR0|It was something that many people here in 
20110128232908.000|20110128232910.000|TR0|Egypt found to be very, very remarkable, 
20110128232910.000|20110128232912.000|TR0|because it is something that normally 
20110128232912.000|20110128232914.000|TR0|isn't the case here in this country.
20110128232914.000|20110128232917.000|TR0|
20110128232917.000|20110128232919.000|TR0|But it happened throughout the day that 
20110128232919.000|20110128232921.000|TR0|they were showing what was going on here 
20110128232921.000|20110128232923.000|TR0|on the streets.  There were even some 
20110128232923.000|20110128232925.000|TR0|comments quite critical of the Egyptian 
20110128232925.000|20110128232927.000|TR0|president.  So, certainly, yes, this is 
20110128232927.000|20110128232929.000|TR0|something that people are able to follow 
20110128232929.000|20110128232931.000|TR0|on TV.
20110128232931.000|20110128232934.000|TR0|
20110128232934.000|20110128232936.000|TR0|And really there is no chance to black out 
20110128232936.000|20110128232938.000|TR0|what's going on here in this country right 
20110128232938.000|20110128232940.000|TR0|now.  It's all on all international 
20110128232940.000|20110128232942.000|TR0|channels. So it's virtually impossible to 
20110128232942.000|20110128232944.000|TR0|stop that from coming out, which is why it 
20110128232944.000|20110128232946.000|TR0|was so strange for the Egyptian security 
20110128232946.000|20110128232948.000|TR0|forces to try and harass us, to try and 
20110128232948.000|20110128232951.000|TR0|harass other television networks, thinking 
20110128232951.000|20110128232953.000|TR0|that maybe they could stop the coverage of 
20110128232953.000|20110128232955.000|TR0|what's going on here on the streets, 
20110128232955.000|20110128232957.000|TR0|because clearly that wasn't going to be 
20110128232957.000|20110128232959.000|TR0|the case -- Wolf.
20110128232959.000|20110128233001.000|TR0|
20110128233001.000|20110128233003.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, Fred, stand by.  I 
20110128233003.000|20110128233006.000|TR0|want everyone to stand by.  The president 
20110128233006.000|20110128233008.000|TR0|of the United States will be addressing 
20110128233008.000|20110128233010.000|TR0|the nation on Egypt momentarily.
20110128233010.000|20110128233012.000|TR0|
20110128233012.000|20110128233014.000|TR0|We will take a quick break.  When we come 
20110128233014.000|20110128233016.000|TR0|back, we will hear from President Obama.
20110128233016.000|20110128233018.000|TR0|
20110128233018.000|20110128233020.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110128233020.000|20110128233023.000|TR0|
20110128233023.000|20110128233025.000|TR0|ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN breaking news.

20110128233027.000|20110128233029.000|TR0|BLITZER:  President Obama getting ready to 
20110128233029.000|20110128233031.000|TR0|go into the State Dining Room over at the 
20110128233031.000|20110128233033.000|TR0|White House.  You're looking at these live 
20110128233033.000|20110128233035.000|TR0|pictures.  He will be addressing the 
20110128233035.000|20110128233037.000|TR0|nation, indeed the world right now on the 
20110128233037.000|20110128233040.000|TR0|dramatic situation unfolding in Egypt as 
20110128233040.000|20110128233042.000|TR0|well as elsewhere in the Middle East.      
20110128233042.000|20110128233044.000|TR0| We will hear from the president.  You 
20110128233044.000|20110128233046.000|TR0|will hear his remarks.  We will go there 
20110128233046.000|20110128233048.000|TR0|as soon as he walks into the State Dining 
20110128233048.000|20110128233050.000|TR0|Room.  We're following all the breaking 
20110128233050.000|20110128233052.000|TR0|news out of Egypt right now, where it's 
20110128233052.000|20110128233055.000|TR0|about 1:30 a.m. Saturday morning in Egypt 
20110128233055.000|20110128233057.000|TR0|right now.
20110128233057.000|20110128233059.000|TR0|
20110128233059.000|20110128233101.000|TR0|Within the last hour, President Hosni 
20110128233101.000|20110128233103.000|TR0|Mubarak went on national television in 
20110128233103.000|20110128233105.000|TR0|Egypt, breaking his own silence about the 
20110128233105.000|20110128233107.000|TR0|days of violent protest aimed at ending 
20110128233107.000|20110128233109.000|TR0|his two decades of rule.
20110128233109.000|20110128233112.000|TR0|
20110128233112.000|20110128233114.000|TR0|But President Mubarak is standing firm.  
20110128233114.000|20110128233116.000|TR0|He says his government will resign, but he 
20110128233116.000|20110128233118.000|TR0|gave absolutely no indication he's 
20110128233118.000|20110128233120.000|TR0|stepping down. And that has triggered yet 
20110128233120.000|20110128233122.000|TR0|more outrage on the streets of Cairo and 
20110128233122.000|20110128233124.000|TR0|Alexandria.  Angry new protests are raging 
20110128233124.000|20110128233127.000|TR0|throughout major Egyptian cities.
20110128233127.000|20110128233129.000|TR0|
20110128233129.000|20110128233131.000|TR0|Let's go to Egypt's second largest city of 
20110128233131.000|20110128233133.000|TR0|Alexandria.  Our senior international 
20110128233133.000|20110128233135.000|TR0|correspondent, Nic Robertson, is there.
20110128233135.000|20110128233137.000|TR0|
20110128233137.000|20110128233139.000|TR0|As we await the president of the United 
20110128233139.000|20110128233141.000|TR0|States, Nic, set the scene for us.  What 
20110128233141.000|20110128233144.000|TR0|is happening in Alexandria?
20110128233144.000|20110128233146.000|TR0|
20110128233146.000|20110128233148.000|TR0|NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  People 
20110128233148.000|20110128233150.000|TR0|are still out on the streets here, Wolf.  
20110128233150.000|20110128233152.000|TR0|It's the young people that have led this 
20110128233152.000|20110128233154.000|TR0|revolution so far.  They -- they certainly 
20110128233154.000|20110128233156.000|TR0|have the energy to stay up all night.
20110128233156.000|20110128233158.000|TR0|
20110128233158.000|20110128233201.000|TR0|A young 19-year-old student, law student 
20110128233201.000|20110128233203.000|TR0|told us, after hearing what President 
20110128233203.000|20110128233205.000|TR0|Mubarak had to say that -- that he's just 
20110128233205.000|20110128233207.000|TR0|blamed the government.  He hasn't taken 
20110128233207.000|20110128233209.000|TR0|responsibility himself.  When he said 
20110128233209.000|20110128233211.000|TR0|we're going to keep coming out here and 
20110128233211.000|20110128233213.000|TR0|demonstrating until we get rid of the 
20110128233213.000|20110128233216.000|TR0|president and his regime.
20110128233216.000|20110128233218.000|TR0|
20110128233218.000|20110128233220.000|TR0|Another 20-year-old student said that this 
20110128233220.000|20110128233222.000|TR0|wasn't enough.  That let a new government 
20110128233222.000|20110128233224.000|TR0|form, but we're going to continue to come 
20110128233224.000|20110128233226.000|TR0|out and protest.  If we don't like a new 
20110128233226.000|20110128233228.000|TR0|government that forms, then we will 
20110128233228.000|20110128233230.000|TR0|continue against them.
20110128233230.000|20110128233233.000|TR0|
20110128233233.000|20110128233235.000|TR0|And another young student said, look, some 
20110128233235.000|20110128233237.000|TR0|of the MPs who have been forced out of 
20110128233237.000|20110128233239.000|TR0|their jobs were good.  Some of them are 
20110128233239.000|20110128233241.000|TR0|bad.  They shouldn't just be forced out of 
20110128233241.000|20110128233243.000|TR0|their jobs.  Some of them should be 
20110128233243.000|20110128233245.000|TR0|arrested.
20110128233245.000|20110128233248.000|TR0|
20110128233248.000|20110128233250.000|TR0|But again, the same message that they 
20110128233250.000|20110128233252.000|TR0|won't rest until -- until President 
20110128233252.000|20110128233254.000|TR0|Mubarak and his regime are out of office.  
20110128233254.000|20110128233256.000|TR0|Everyone here will be waiting to hear what 
20110128233256.000|20110128233258.000|TR0|President Obama says.  Very keen to 
20110128233258.000|20110128233300.000|TR0|understand where the United States support 
20110128233300.000|20110128233302.000|TR0|lies.  Is there an indication that 
20110128233302.000|20110128233305.000|TR0|whatever he says can add weight to their 
20110128233305.000|20110128233307.000|TR0|feeling that they would like to get rid of 
20110128233307.000|20110128233309.000|TR0|-- like to get rid of President Mubarak?
20110128233309.000|20110128233311.000|TR0|
20110128233311.000|20110128233313.000|TR0|But it's been on the streets here the 
20110128233313.000|20110128233315.000|TR0|biggest dynamic, the biggest change we're 
20110128233315.000|20110128233317.000|TR0|seeing take place, the fact that the 
20110128233317.000|20110128233319.000|TR0|police were beaten off the streets.  We 
20110128233319.000|20110128233322.000|TR0|were on a side street here in central 
20110128233322.000|20110128233324.000|TR0|Alexandria earlier today and saw that 
20110128233324.000|20110128233326.000|TR0|dynamic in play.  That moment where the 
20110128233326.000|20110128233328.000|TR0|police realized they couldn't hold the 
20110128233328.000|20110128233330.000|TR0|crowd back and had to give up the fight.   
20110128233330.000|20110128233332.000|TR0|    BLITZER:  Nic, standby, because I want 
20110128233332.000|20110128233334.000|TR0|-- I want you to listen closely, and I 
20110128233334.000|20110128233337.000|TR0|want all of our viewers, in fact, to 
20110128233337.000|20110128233339.000|TR0|listen closely to the president of the 
20110128233339.000|20110128233341.000|TR0|United States.  Within a few seconds he's 
20110128233341.000|20110128233343.000|TR0|going to be walking to that podium right 
20110128233343.000|20110128233345.000|TR0|over there in the state dining room.  He's 
20110128233345.000|20110128233347.000|TR0|going to be speaking directly to all of us 
20110128233347.000|20110128233349.000|TR0|about what's going on in Egypt and 
20110128233349.000|20110128233351.000|TR0|throughout the Middle East right now.
20110128233351.000|20110128233354.000|TR0|
20110128233354.000|20110128233356.000|TR0|For the United States, the stakes are 
20110128233356.000|20110128233358.000|TR0|serious.  Very, very serious.  Couldn't be 
20110128233358.000|20110128233400.000|TR0|more serious as far as Egypt and its 
20110128233400.000|20110128233402.000|TR0|strategic partnership with the United 
20110128233402.000|20110128233404.000|TR0|States is concerned.  We'll see how far 
20110128233404.000|20110128233406.000|TR0|the president goes in expressing support 
20110128233406.000|20110128233409.000|TR0|or not for Egyptian President Hosni 
20110128233409.000|20110128233411.000|TR0|Mubarak, who spoke just a little while 
20110128233411.000|20110128233413.000|TR0|ago, making it clear he's staying in 
20110128233413.000|20110128233415.000|TR0|power; at least will attempt to stay in 
20110128233415.000|20110128233417.000|TR0|power.
20110128233417.000|20110128233419.000|TR0|
20110128233419.000|20110128233421.000|TR0|The Egyptian leader giving absolutely no 
20110128233421.000|20110128233423.000|TR0|indication whatsoever that he's getting 
20110128233423.000|20110128233426.000|TR0|ready to step down, although there have 
20110128233426.000|20110128233428.000|TR0|been reports, reports that his wife has 
20110128233428.000|20110128233430.000|TR0|already left Egypt, is in London perhaps.  
20110128233430.000|20110128233432.000|TR0|And that his son, Gamal, who had been 
20110128233432.000|20110128233434.000|TR0|widely seen as the heir apparent to 
20110128233434.000|20110128233436.000|TR0|President Mubarak, that Gamal Mubarak is 
20110128233436.000|20110128233438.000|TR0|also out of the country right now.  We 
20110128233438.000|20110128233440.000|TR0|have not been able to absolutely confirm 
20110128233440.000|20110128233443.000|TR0|those reports.  But they certainly have 
20110128233443.000|20110128233445.000|TR0|been evident.
20110128233445.000|20110128233447.000|TR0|
20110128233447.000|20110128233449.000|TR0|Here comes the president.  So let's listen.
20110128233449.000|20110128233451.000|TR0|
20110128233451.000|20110128233453.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110128233453.000|20110128233455.000|TR0|STATES:  Good evening, everybody.
20110128233455.000|20110128233458.000|TR0|
20110128233458.000|20110128233500.000|TR0|My administration has been closely 
20110128233500.000|20110128233502.000|TR0|monitoring the situation in Egypt, and I 
20110128233502.000|20110128233504.000|TR0|know that we will be learning more 
20110128233504.000|20110128233506.000|TR0|tomorrow when day breaks.
20110128233506.000|20110128233508.000|TR0|
20110128233508.000|20110128233510.000|TR0|As the situation continues to unfold, our 
20110128233510.000|20110128233512.000|TR0|first concern is preventing injury or loss 
20110128233512.000|20110128233515.000|TR0|of life.  So I want to be very clear in 
20110128233515.000|20110128233517.000|TR0|calling upon the Egyptian authorities to 
20110128233517.000|20110128233519.000|TR0|refrain from any violence against peaceful 
20110128233519.000|20110128233521.000|TR0|protesters.  The people of Egypt have 
20110128233521.000|20110128233523.000|TR0|rights that are universal.  That includes 
20110128233523.000|20110128233525.000|TR0|the right to peaceful assembly and 
20110128233525.000|20110128233527.000|TR0|association, the right to free speech, and 
20110128233527.000|20110128233530.000|TR0|the ability to determine their own 
20110128233530.000|20110128233532.000|TR0|destiny.  These are human rights.  And the 
20110128233532.000|20110128233534.000|TR0|United States will stand up for them 
20110128233534.000|20110128233536.000|TR0|everywhere.
20110128233536.000|20110128233538.000|TR0|
20110128233538.000|20110128233540.000|TR0|I also call upon the Egyptian government 
20110128233540.000|20110128233542.000|TR0|to reverse the actions that they've taken 
20110128233542.000|20110128233544.000|TR0|to interfere with access to the Internet, 
20110128233544.000|20110128233547.000|TR0|to cell- phone service and to social 
20110128233547.000|20110128233549.000|TR0|networks that do so much to connect people 
20110128233549.000|20110128233551.000|TR0|in the 21st century.
20110128233551.000|20110128233553.000|TR0|
20110128233553.000|20110128233555.000|TR0|At the same time, those protesting in the 
20110128233555.000|20110128233557.000|TR0|streets have a responsibility to express 
20110128233557.000|20110128233559.000|TR0|themselves peacefully.  Violence and 
20110128233559.000|20110128233601.000|TR0|destruction will not lead to the reforms 
20110128233601.000|20110128233604.000|TR0|that they seek.
20110128233604.000|20110128233606.000|TR0|
20110128233606.000|20110128233608.000|TR0|Now going forward, this moment of 
20110128233608.000|20110128233610.000|TR0|volatility has to be turned into a moment 
20110128233610.000|20110128233612.000|TR0|of promise.  The United States has a close 
20110128233612.000|20110128233614.000|TR0|partnership with Egypt.  And we've 
20110128233614.000|20110128233616.000|TR0|cooperated on many issues, including 
20110128233616.000|20110128233619.000|TR0|working together to advance a more 
20110128233619.000|20110128233621.000|TR0|peaceful region.
20110128233621.000|20110128233623.000|TR0|
20110128233623.000|20110128233625.000|TR0|But we've always been clear that there 
20110128233625.000|20110128233627.000|TR0|must be reform: political, social and 
20110128233627.000|20110128233629.000|TR0|economic reforms that meet the aspirations 
20110128233629.000|20110128233631.000|TR0|of the Egyptian people.  In the absence of 
20110128233631.000|20110128233633.000|TR0|these reforms, grievances have built up 
20110128233633.000|20110128233636.000|TR0|over time.
20110128233636.000|20110128233638.000|TR0|
20110128233638.000|20110128233640.000|TR0|When President Mubarak addressed the 
20110128233640.000|20110128233642.000|TR0|Egyptian people tonight, he pledged a 
20110128233642.000|20110128233644.000|TR0|better democracy and greater economic 
20110128233644.000|20110128233646.000|TR0|opportunity.  I just spoke to him after 
20110128233646.000|20110128233648.000|TR0|his speech.  And I told him he has a 
20110128233648.000|20110128233651.000|TR0|responsibility to give meaning to those 
20110128233651.000|20110128233653.000|TR0|words, to take concrete steps and actions 
20110128233653.000|20110128233655.000|TR0|that deliver on that promise.
20110128233655.000|20110128233657.000|TR0|
20110128233657.000|20110128233659.000|TR0|Violence will not address the grievances 
20110128233659.000|20110128233701.000|TR0|of the Egyptian people. And suppressing 
20110128233701.000|20110128233703.000|TR0|ideas never succeeds in making them go 
20110128233703.000|20110128233705.000|TR0|away.  What's needed right now are 
20110128233705.000|20110128233708.000|TR0|concrete steps that advance the rights of 
20110128233708.000|20110128233710.000|TR0|the Egyptian people; a meaningful dialogue 
20110128233710.000|20110128233712.000|TR0|between the government and its citizens; 
20110128233712.000|20110128233714.000|TR0|and a path of political change that leads 
20110128233714.000|20110128233716.000|TR0|to a future of greater freedom and greater 
20110128233716.000|20110128233718.000|TR0|opportunity and justice for the Egyptian 
20110128233718.000|20110128233720.000|TR0|people.
20110128233720.000|20110128233722.000|TR0|
20110128233722.000|20110128233725.000|TR0|Now ultimately, the future of Egypt will 
20110128233725.000|20110128233727.000|TR0|be determined by the Egyptian people.  I 
20110128233727.000|20110128233729.000|TR0|believe that the Egyptian people want the 
20110128233729.000|20110128233731.000|TR0|same things that we all want: a better 
20110128233731.000|20110128233733.000|TR0|life for ourselves and our children, and a 
20110128233733.000|20110128233735.000|TR0|government that is fair and just and 
20110128233735.000|20110128233737.000|TR0|responsive.
20110128233737.000|20110128233740.000|TR0|
20110128233740.000|20110128233742.000|TR0|Put simply, the Egyptian people want a 
20110128233742.000|20110128233744.000|TR0|future that befits the heirs to a great 
20110128233744.000|20110128233746.000|TR0|and ancient civilization.  The United 
20110128233746.000|20110128233748.000|TR0|States always will be a partner in pursuit 
20110128233748.000|20110128233750.000|TR0|of that future, and we are committed to 
20110128233750.000|20110128233752.000|TR0|working with the Egyptian government and 
20110128233752.000|20110128233754.000|TR0|the Egyptian people, all quarters, to 
20110128233754.000|20110128233757.000|TR0|achieve it.
20110128233757.000|20110128233759.000|TR0|
20110128233759.000|20110128233801.000|TR0|Around the world, governments have an 
20110128233801.000|20110128233803.000|TR0|obligation to respond to their citizens.  
20110128233803.000|20110128233805.000|TR0|That's true here in the United States.  
20110128233805.000|20110128233807.000|TR0|That's true in Asia.  It's true in Europe. 
20110128233807.000|20110128233809.000|TR0| It's true in Africa.  And it's certainly 
20110128233809.000|20110128233812.000|TR0|true in the Arab world, where a new 
20110128233812.000|20110128233814.000|TR0|generation of citizens has the right to be 
20110128233814.000|20110128233816.000|TR0|heard.
20110128233816.000|20110128233818.000|TR0|
20110128233818.000|20110128233820.000|TR0|When I was in Cairo shortly after I was 
20110128233820.000|20110128233822.000|TR0|elected president, I said that all 
20110128233822.000|20110128233824.000|TR0|governments must maintain power through 
20110128233824.000|20110128233826.000|TR0|consent, not coercion.  That is the single 
20110128233826.000|20110128233829.000|TR0|standard by which the people of Egypt will 
20110128233829.000|20110128233831.000|TR0|achieve the future they deserve.  Surely, 
20110128233831.000|20110128233833.000|TR0|there will be difficult days to come.
20110128233833.000|20110128233835.000|TR0|
20110128233835.000|20110128233837.000|TR0|But the United States will continue to 
20110128233837.000|20110128233839.000|TR0|stand up for the rights of the Egyptian 
20110128233839.000|20110128233841.000|TR0|people and work with their government in 
20110128233841.000|20110128233843.000|TR0|pursuit of a future that is more just, 
20110128233843.000|20110128233846.000|TR0|more free, and more hopeful.
20110128233846.000|20110128233848.000|TR0|
20110128233848.000|20110128233850.000|TR0|Thank you very much.
20110128233850.000|20110128233852.000|TR0|
20110128233852.000|20110128233854.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  You heard a pool 
20110128233854.000|20110128233856.000|TR0|reporter trying to shout a question to the 
20110128233856.000|20110128233858.000|TR0|president, but he walked out right away.
20110128233858.000|20110128233901.000|TR0|
20110128233901.000|20110128233903.000|TR0|President Obama, a brief statement, but a 
20110128233903.000|20110128233905.000|TR0|very important statement, urging calm 
20110128233905.000|20110128233907.000|TR0|right now, urging restraint on everyone: 
20110128233907.000|20110128233909.000|TR0|the protestors and the Egyptian military 
20110128233909.000|20110128233911.000|TR0|and police, saying that everyone must 
20110128233911.000|20110128233913.000|TR0|refrain from violence right now.  Egyptian 
20110128233913.000|20110128233915.000|TR0|authorities, he was specifically 
20110128233915.000|20110128233918.000|TR0|addressing them right at the top.  Also 
20110128233918.000|20110128233920.000|TR0|urging Egyptian authorities to open up the 
20110128233920.000|20110128233922.000|TR0|Internet, the social networking sites, 
20110128233922.000|20110128233924.000|TR0|saying that there can be peaceful 
20110128233924.000|20110128233926.000|TR0|protests, urging the protesters to avoid 
20110128233926.000|20110128233928.000|TR0|violence.
20110128233928.000|20110128233930.000|TR0|
20110128233930.000|20110128233933.000|TR0|This is a moment of promise, he says, that 
20110128233933.000|20110128233935.000|TR0|could emerge out of a moment of volatility.
20110128233935.000|20110128233937.000|TR0|
20110128233937.000|20110128233939.000|TR0|Fred Pleitgen is our man in Cairo right 
20110128233939.000|20110128233941.000|TR0|now.
20110128233941.000|20110128233943.000|TR0|
20110128233943.000|20110128233945.000|TR0|Fred, I assume you were listening to the 
20110128233945.000|20110128233947.000|TR0|president of the United States.  You heard 
20110128233947.000|20110128233950.000|TR0|about an hour or so ago the Egyptian 
20110128233950.000|20110128233952.000|TR0|president, Hosni Mubarak, speak out.
20110128233952.000|20110128233954.000|TR0|
20110128233954.000|20110128233956.000|TR0|We just lost your light, but you can 
20110128233956.000|20110128233958.000|TR0|speak.  We can hear you, Fred.  So go 
20110128233958.000|20110128234000.000|TR0|ahead.  Give us your sense of how this is 
20110128234000.000|20110128234002.000|TR0|going to play in Egypt, what we heard from 
20110128234002.000|20110128234004.000|TR0|President Obama.
20110128234004.000|20110128234007.000|TR0|
20110128234007.000|20110128234009.000|TR0|FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  
20110128234009.000|20110128234011.000|TR0|Yes, I'm sorry.  Our light just blew out 
20110128234011.000|20110128234013.000|TR0|here on the live position.
20110128234013.000|20110128234015.000|TR0|
20110128234015.000|20110128234017.000|TR0|I don't think this is going to be enough 
20110128234017.000|20110128234019.000|TR0|for the protesters we've been seeing here 
20110128234019.000|20110128234022.000|TR0|today.  What they've been saying is they 
20110128234022.000|20110128234024.000|TR0|would like to see the U.S. go away from 
20110128234024.000|20110128234026.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak and declare that this is no 
20110128234026.000|20110128234028.000|TR0|longer their moment (ph).  What we just 
20110128234028.000|20110128234030.000|TR0|heard from President Obama is that he's 
20110128234030.000|20110128234032.000|TR0|saying there needs to be more reform.  
20110128234032.000|20110128234034.000|TR0|There needs to be calm on the streets now. 
20110128234034.000|20110128234036.000|TR0| But that he is calling on Hosni Mubarak 
20110128234036.000|20110128234039.000|TR0|to implement those reforms.  And that's 
20110128234039.000|20110128234041.000|TR0|clearly not something that many people 
20110128234041.000|20110128234043.000|TR0|here believe will happen.  This man's been 
20110128234043.000|20110128234045.000|TR0|in power for 30 years here.
20110128234045.000|20110128234047.000|TR0|
20110128234047.000|20110128234049.000|TR0|A lot of people here in Egypt, especially 
20110128234049.000|20110128234051.000|TR0|the younger generation the president was 
20110128234051.000|20110128234054.000|TR0|just talking about, have known no other 
20110128234054.000|20110128234056.000|TR0|president than Hosni Mubarak.  And 
20110128234056.000|20110128234058.000|TR0|clearly, they're very dissatisfied with 
20110128234058.000|20110128234100.000|TR0|what they're getting.
20110128234100.000|20110128234102.000|TR0|
20110128234102.000|20110128234104.000|TR0|People have been telling me again and 
20110128234104.000|20110128234106.000|TR0|again on the streets to them this is about 
20110128234106.000|20110128234108.000|TR0|social change: more freedoms, more rights. 
20110128234108.000|20110128234111.000|TR0| This is about having jobs.  This is about 
20110128234111.000|20110128234113.000|TR0|having economic opportunities.  This is 
20110128234113.000|20110128234115.000|TR0|about having opportunities in education, 
20110128234115.000|20110128234117.000|TR0|things that they say have been lacking 
20110128234117.000|20110128234119.000|TR0|across the board.
20110128234119.000|20110128234121.000|TR0|
20110128234121.000|20110128234123.000|TR0|So certainly to a lot of the people that 
20110128234123.000|20110128234125.000|TR0|we've been speaking to, nothing short of 
20110128234125.000|20110128234128.000|TR0|President Mubarak stepping down would have 
20110128234128.000|20110128234130.000|TR0|been enough for them.  Clearly, that's not 
20110128234130.000|20110128234132.000|TR0|going to be the case.  They were 
20110128234132.000|20110128234134.000|TR0|expecting, they told me, a strong 
20110128234134.000|20110128234136.000|TR0|statement from America to the extent that 
20110128234136.000|20110128234138.000|TR0|America also felt that there needed to be 
20110128234138.000|20110128234140.000|TR0|change.
20110128234140.000|20110128234143.000|TR0|
20110128234143.000|20110128234145.000|TR0|And you know, one of the other things that 
20110128234145.000|20110128234147.000|TR0|they've been talking about is they keep 
20110128234147.000|20110128234149.000|TR0|telling me America seems to think that, 
20110128234149.000|20110128234151.000|TR0|because Hosni Mubarak is their ally, this 
20110128234151.000|20110128234153.000|TR0|is the only person they can go with in 
20110128234153.000|20110128234155.000|TR0|Egypt.  They say give it a chance, let the 
20110128234155.000|20110128234157.000|TR0|people find a new leader here, and then 
20110128234157.000|20110128234200.000|TR0|hopefully move forward as a beacon of 
20110128234200.000|20110128234202.000|TR0|stability and democracy for people here in 
20110128234202.000|20110128234204.000|TR0|this country -- Wolf.

20110128234206.000|20110128234208.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Fred, stand by for a moment, 
20110128234208.000|20110128234210.000|TR0|because I want to play a little extra of 
20110128234210.000|20110128234212.000|TR0|what we just heard from President Obama, 
20110128234212.000|20110128234215.000|TR0|making the point that he just spoke with 
20110128234215.000|20110128234217.000|TR0|the Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, on the 
20110128234217.000|20110128234219.000|TR0|phone.  He wanted to speak with him before 
20110128234219.000|20110128234221.000|TR0|he addressed the American people.
20110128234221.000|20110128234223.000|TR0|
20110128234223.000|20110128234225.000|TR0|And as a result, he said that when he 
20110128234225.000|20110128234227.000|TR0|spoke with President Mubarak, he urged him 
20110128234227.000|20110128234229.000|TR0|to exercise restraint and to address the 
20110128234229.000|20110128234232.000|TR0|grievances of the people of Egypt.  Very, 
20110128234232.000|20110128234234.000|TR0|very carefully phrased words.  Here's a 
20110128234234.000|20110128234236.000|TR0|little excerpt of what President Obama 
20110128234236.000|20110128234238.000|TR0|said.

20110128234244.000|20110128234246.000|TR0|OBAMA:  As the situation continues to 
20110128234246.000|20110128234249.000|TR0|unfold, our first concern is preventing 
20110128234249.000|20110128234251.000|TR0|injury or loss of life.  So I want to be 
20110128234251.000|20110128234253.000|TR0|very clear in calling upon the Egyptian 
20110128234253.000|20110128234255.000|TR0|authorities to refrain from any violence 
20110128234255.000|20110128234257.000|TR0|against peaceful protesters.

20110128234259.000|20110128234301.000|TR0|The people of Egypt have rights that are 
20110128234301.000|20110128234304.000|TR0|universal.  That includes the right to 
20110128234304.000|20110128234306.000|TR0|peaceful assembly and association; the 
20110128234306.000|20110128234308.000|TR0|right to free speech; and the ability to 
20110128234308.000|20110128234310.000|TR0|determine their own destiny.  These are 
20110128234310.000|20110128234312.000|TR0|human rights, and the United States will 
20110128234312.000|20110128234314.000|TR0|stand up for them everywhere.

20110128234327.000|20110128234329.000|TR0|Nic Robertson is on the scene for us in 
20110128234329.000|20110128234331.000|TR0|Alexandria, Egypt. That's the second 
20110128234331.000|20110128234333.000|TR0|largest city in Egypt.

20110128234336.000|20110128234338.000|TR0|Same question to you, Nic.  What the 
20110128234338.000|20110128234340.000|TR0|president of the United States just said, 
20110128234340.000|20110128234342.000|TR0|how do you think that's going to play, 
20110128234342.000|20110128234344.000|TR0|because it's the middle of the night right 
20110128234344.000|20110128234346.000|TR0|now in Alexandria and Cairo?  But when 
20110128234346.000|20110128234348.000|TR0|daylight comes out, Saturday is a regular 
20110128234348.000|20110128234350.000|TR0|day in Egypt.  It's the first working day 
20110128234350.000|20110128234353.000|TR0|of the week.  How is all of this going to 
20110128234353.000|20110128234355.000|TR0|play?

20110128234357.000|20110128234359.000|TR0|ROBERTSON:  People are going to look at 
20110128234359.000|20110128234401.000|TR0|what President Obama said.  They're going 
20110128234401.000|20110128234403.000|TR0|to -- they're going to think about it, and 
20110128234403.000|20110128234405.000|TR0|they're going to reflect that he probably 
20110128234405.000|20110128234407.000|TR0|didn't go far enough for them.
20110128234407.000|20110128234410.000|TR0|
20110128234410.000|20110128234412.000|TR0|There's no call here for national 
20110128234412.000|20110128234414.000|TR0|dialogue, for example.  There's no demand 
20110128234414.000|20110128234416.000|TR0|on President Mubarak for free and fair 
20110128234416.000|20110128234418.000|TR0|elections.  These are things that people 
20110128234418.000|20110128234420.000|TR0|here might have hoped for.  They want -- 
20110128234420.000|20110128234422.000|TR0|they really would like to see and get a 
20110128234422.000|20110128234425.000|TR0|sense the United States is more behind the 
20110128234425.000|20110128234427.000|TR0|people and more prepared to be taken much 
20110128234427.000|20110128234429.000|TR0|further with President Mubarak than this 
20110128234429.000|20110128234431.000|TR0|appears to be at this stage.  I think 
20110128234431.000|20110128234433.000|TR0|there's going to be a good degree of 
20110128234433.000|20110128234435.000|TR0|disappointment.
20110128234435.000|20110128234437.000|TR0|
20110128234437.000|20110128234439.000|TR0|But the real thing people are going to 
20110128234439.000|20110128234442.000|TR0|wake up to on Saturday morning here is 
20110128234442.000|20110128234444.000|TR0|it's a very simple fact that President 
20110128234444.000|20110128234446.000|TR0|Mubarak says he's not going.  He's just 
20110128234446.000|20110128234448.000|TR0|firing his government, and he's going to 
20110128234448.000|20110128234450.000|TR0|stay.  And that's the challenge to the 
20110128234450.000|20110128234452.000|TR0|people and the protesters here. And that's 
20110128234452.000|20110128234454.000|TR0|what's going to rile them most of all.  
20110128234454.000|20110128234457.000|TR0|But they're going to disappointed they 
20110128234457.000|20110128234459.000|TR0|haven't heard more from the United States.
20110128234459.000|20110128234501.000|TR0|
20110128234501.000|20110128234503.000|TR0|And there's something you hear circulate 
20110128234503.000|20110128234505.000|TR0|here at the moment here, Wolf, among the 
20110128234505.000|20110128234507.000|TR0|people, whether it's right or not, there's 
20110128234507.000|20110128234509.000|TR0|a lot of people here have heard the rumor 
20110128234509.000|20110128234511.000|TR0|that some of these -- some of these tear 
20110128234511.000|20110128234514.000|TR0|gas rounds that are being fired, fired 
20110128234514.000|20110128234516.000|TR0|from -- using U.S. cartridges, and 
20110128234516.000|20110128234518.000|TR0|although that's not something we can 
20110128234518.000|20110128234520.000|TR0|substantiate, that's certainly something 
20110128234520.000|20110128234522.000|TR0|people believe on the streets.
20110128234522.000|20110128234524.000|TR0|
20110128234524.000|20110128234526.000|TR0|They really want to know where the United 
20110128234526.000|20110128234528.000|TR0|States stands, and they want the United 
20110128234528.000|20110128234531.000|TR0|States to stand behind them and their 
20110128234531.000|20110128234533.000|TR0|cause for democracy and all the things 
20110128234533.000|20110128234535.000|TR0|that President Obama listed there.  But 
20110128234535.000|20110128234537.000|TR0|it's little things like this that's going 
20110128234537.000|20110128234539.000|TR0|to play on their minds, Wolf.
20110128234539.000|20110128234541.000|TR0|
20110128234541.000|20110128234543.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Nic Robertson, I'd like you to 
20110128234543.000|20110128234546.000|TR0|standby.  Fred Pleitgen in Cairo, stand 
20110128234546.000|20110128234548.000|TR0|by, as well.
20110128234548.000|20110128234550.000|TR0|
20110128234550.000|20110128234552.000|TR0|We're going to take a quick break.  The 
20110128234552.000|20110128234554.000|TR0|breaking news, though, will continue right 
20110128234554.000|20110128234556.000|TR0|here.  It's unfolding on the streets of 
20110128234556.000|20110128234558.000|TR0|Egypt right now.  We're not leaving the 
20110128234558.000|20110128234600.000|TR0|story.  The stakes are clearly enormous.  
20110128234600.000|20110128234603.000|TR0|We'll be right back.
20110128234603.000|20110128234605.000|TR0|
20110128234605.000|20110128234607.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110128234607.000|20110128234609.000|TR0|
20110128234609.000|20110128234611.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Earlier in the day -- look at 
20110128234611.000|20110128234613.000|TR0|this, one of the bridges over the Nile 
20110128234613.000|20110128234615.000|TR0|River -- it got ugly out there.  
20110128234615.000|20110128234618.000|TR0|Protesters demonstrating, the Egyptian 
20110128234618.000|20110128234620.000|TR0|police responding.  That's just one scene. 
20110128234620.000|20110128234622.000|TR0|Multiply this scene across Cairo, across 
20110128234622.000|20110128234624.000|TR0|Alexandria, across Suez, other cities in 
20110128234624.000|20110128234626.000|TR0|Egypt.  The anger clearly surfacing right 
20110128234626.000|20110128234628.000|TR0|now.
20110128234628.000|20110128234630.000|TR0|
20110128234630.000|20110128234632.000|TR0|We heard President Mubarak just a little 
20110128234632.000|20110128234635.000|TR0|while ago, saying yes, he's asked the 
20110128234635.000|20110128234637.000|TR0|current government to resign, but he'll 
20110128234637.000|20110128234639.000|TR0|have a new government tomorrow.  He's 
20110128234639.000|20110128234641.000|TR0|making it clear, defiantly, he's staying 
20110128234641.000|20110128234643.000|TR0|in business.
20110128234643.000|20110128234645.000|TR0|
20110128234645.000|20110128234647.000|TR0|We just heard President Obama say he just 
20110128234647.000|20110128234649.000|TR0|got off the phone with President Mubarak 
20110128234649.000|20110128234652.000|TR0|and urged restraint.  Let's go to the 
20110128234652.000|20110128234654.000|TR0|White House. Our White House correspondent 
20110128234654.000|20110128234656.000|TR0|Dan Lothian is standing by.
20110128234656.000|20110128234658.000|TR0|
20110128234658.000|20110128234700.000|TR0|The words that the president spoke 
20110128234700.000|20110128234702.000|TR0|tonight, I assume, were very, very 
20110128234702.000|20110128234704.000|TR0|carefully crafted after a full day of 
20110128234704.000|20110128234707.000|TR0|crisis meetings going on.
20110128234707.000|20110128234709.000|TR0|
20110128234709.000|20110128234711.000|TR0|DAN LOTHIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's 
20110128234711.000|20110128234713.000|TR0|right, Wolf.  This administration being 
20110128234713.000|20110128234715.000|TR0|very careful not to inflame the situation 
20110128234715.000|20110128234717.000|TR0|in Egypt.
20110128234717.000|20110128234719.000|TR0|
20110128234719.000|20110128234721.000|TR0|And I don't know if you heard at the end 
20110128234721.000|20110128234724.000|TR0|of the president's remarks, I was in the 
20110128234724.000|20110128234726.000|TR0|room.  I shouted at the president, asking 
20110128234726.000|20110128234728.000|TR0|him if it was time for President Mubarak 
20110128234728.000|20110128234730.000|TR0|to step down.  The president ignored the 
20110128234730.000|20110128234732.000|TR0|question.  But that's one thing the White 
20110128234732.000|20110128234734.000|TR0|House has not weighed in on, whether or 
20110128234734.000|20110128234736.000|TR0|not there should be regime change in 
20110128234736.000|20110128234739.000|TR0|Egypt, instead focusing on some of the 
20110128234739.000|20110128234741.000|TR0|issues that need to change, such as 
20110128234741.000|20110128234743.000|TR0|universal rights for the people of Egypt 
20110128234743.000|20110128234745.000|TR0|to reverse this blocking of the social 
20110128234745.000|20110128234747.000|TR0|media and phones there.
20110128234747.000|20110128234749.000|TR0|
20110128234749.000|20110128234751.000|TR0|But again, staying away from that question 
20110128234751.000|20110128234753.000|TR0|as to whether or not the president of 
20110128234753.000|20110128234756.000|TR0|Egypt should step down.
20110128234756.000|20110128234758.000|TR0|
20110128234758.000|20110128234800.000|TR0|One of the things, though, that this 
20110128234800.000|20110128234802.000|TR0|administration is looking at is reviewing 
20110128234802.000|20110128234804.000|TR0|over the -- over the last few days and 
20110128234804.000|20110128234806.000|TR0|looking forward over the next few days 
20110128234806.000|20110128234808.000|TR0|what the government of Egypt is doing, 
20110128234808.000|20110128234810.000|TR0|what the police, and also the military and 
20110128234810.000|20110128234813.000|TR0|police are doing there on the ground, and 
20110128234813.000|20110128234815.000|TR0|seeing how this could impact the aid that 
20110128234815.000|20110128234817.000|TR0|the U.S. gives to Egypt, including more 
20110128234817.000|20110128234819.000|TR0|than a billion dollars each year.
20110128234819.000|20110128234821.000|TR0|
20110128234821.000|20110128234823.000|TR0|They want to figure out if any changes 
20110128234823.000|20110128234825.000|TR0|will, indeed, take place. But Robert Gibbs 
20110128234825.000|20110128234828.000|TR0|stopping just short of saying that there's 
20110128234828.000|20110128234830.000|TR0|a threat tied to the aid that the U.S. 
20110128234830.000|20110128234832.000|TR0|gives to Egypt, Wolf.
20110128234832.000|20110128234834.000|TR0|
20110128234834.000|20110128234836.000|TR0|BLITZER:  They're saying that the 
20110128234836.000|20110128234838.000|TR0|president right now fully, obviously, 
20110128234838.000|20110128234840.000|TR0|appreciates what's at stake for the United 
20110128234840.000|20110128234842.000|TR0|States in the aftermath, assuming 
20110128234842.000|20110128234845.000|TR0|President Mubarak were to leave or go down 
20110128234845.000|20110128234847.000|TR0|or flee the country or whatever.  But no 
20110128234847.000|20110128234849.000|TR0|one really knows for sure.  And I'm sure 
20110128234849.000|20110128234851.000|TR0|U.S. experts you've been talking to over 
20110128234851.000|20110128234853.000|TR0|at the White House and elsewhere, no one 
20110128234853.000|20110128234855.000|TR0|knows what's going to follow Mubarak if, 
20110128234855.000|20110128234857.000|TR0|in fact, he's forced to leave office.
20110128234857.000|20110128234900.000|TR0|
20110128234900.000|20110128234902.000|TR0|LOTHIAN:  That's exactly -- exactly true, 
20110128234902.000|20110128234904.000|TR0|Wolf.  I mean, the situation now might 
20110128234904.000|20110128234906.000|TR0|look very grave, but no one knows what 
20110128234906.000|20110128234908.000|TR0|will happen if, indeed, he did leave, step 
20110128234908.000|20110128234910.000|TR0|down and flee the country.
20110128234910.000|20110128234912.000|TR0|
20110128234912.000|20110128234914.000|TR0|The one thing that this administration has 
20110128234914.000|20110128234917.000|TR0|been very clear to point out time and time 
20110128234917.000|20110128234919.000|TR0|again is that Egypt has been a critical 
20110128234919.000|20110128234921.000|TR0|partner in the region when it comes to 
20110128234921.000|20110128234923.000|TR0|Mideast peace, when it comes to trying to 
20110128234923.000|20110128234925.000|TR0|get Iran to back off its nuclear ambitions.
20110128234925.000|20110128234927.000|TR0|
20110128234927.000|20110128234929.000|TR0|So this is an important partner.  But as 
20110128234929.000|20110128234931.000|TR0|you heard the president point out, that 
20110128234931.000|20110128234934.000|TR0|this is someone that they look forward to 
20110128234934.000|20110128234936.000|TR0|working with in the future, but realize 
20110128234936.000|20110128234938.000|TR0|that there will be difficult times ahead. 
20110128234938.000|20110128234940.000|TR0|Again, the unknown sometimes a lot worse 
20110128234940.000|20110128234942.000|TR0|than what you do know.
20110128234942.000|20110128234944.000|TR0|
20110128234944.000|20110128234946.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So what does the president have 
20110128234946.000|20110128234949.000|TR0|planned this weekend? Because I assume 
20110128234949.000|20110128234951.000|TR0|Saturday, Sunday, this situation on the 
20110128234951.000|20110128234953.000|TR0|streets of the major Egyptian cities and 
20110128234953.000|20110128234955.000|TR0|elsewhere is only going to escalate.
20110128234955.000|20110128234957.000|TR0|
20110128234957.000|20110128234959.000|TR0|LOTHIAN:  That's right.  And this 
20110128234959.000|20110128235001.000|TR0|administration very, very concerned about 
20110128235001.000|20110128235003.000|TR0|the violence that's taking place there.  
20110128235003.000|20110128235006.000|TR0|The president getting up-to-the-minute 
20110128235006.000|20110128235008.000|TR0|information on what's been going on there, 
20110128235008.000|20110128235010.000|TR0|beginning with an overnight memo that was 
20110128235010.000|20110128235012.000|TR0|put together by his national security 
20110128235012.000|20110128235014.000|TR0|adviser, Tom Donlan.
20110128235014.000|20110128235016.000|TR0|
20110128235016.000|20110128235018.000|TR0|And then this briefing that the president 
20110128235018.000|20110128235021.000|TR0|typically gets in the mornings on a whole 
20110128235021.000|20110128235023.000|TR0|host of issues, both domestic and foreign 
20110128235023.000|20110128235025.000|TR0|policy issues today focused solely on 
20110128235025.000|20110128235027.000|TR0|Egypt.  We're told that that meeting 
20110128235027.000|20110128235029.000|TR0|lasted for about 40 minutes with his top 
20110128235029.000|20110128235031.000|TR0|national security advisers.
20110128235031.000|20110128235033.000|TR0|
20110128235033.000|20110128235035.000|TR0|So the president will continue to get 
20110128235035.000|20110128235038.000|TR0|briefed on the situation there.  And of 
20110128235038.000|20110128235040.000|TR0|course, that will guide what they do going 
20110128235040.000|20110128235042.000|TR0|forward.
20110128235042.000|20110128235044.000|TR0|
20110128235044.000|20110128235046.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Hold on a minute, Dan, because I 
20110128235046.000|20110128235048.000|TR0|want to bring on the phone the Egyptian 
20110128235048.000|20110128235050.000|TR0|ambassador to the United States, 
20110128235050.000|20110128235052.000|TR0|Ambassador Sameh Shoukry, who is joining 
20110128235052.000|20110128235055.000|TR0|us now.
20110128235055.000|20110128235057.000|TR0|
20110128235057.000|20110128235059.000|TR0|Ambassador, this is obviously a tense 
20110128235059.000|20110128235101.000|TR0|moment.  Give us your reaction, first of 
20110128235101.000|20110128235103.000|TR0|all, to what we just heard from the 
20110128235103.000|20110128235105.000|TR0|president of the United States.
20110128235105.000|20110128235107.000|TR0|
20110128235107.000|20110128235110.000|TR0|AMBASSADOR SAMEH SHOUKRY, EGYPTIAN 
20110128235110.000|20110128235112.000|TR0|AMBASSADOR TO U.S. (via phone):  Thank 
20110128235112.000|20110128235114.000|TR0|you.  But the president, of course, 
20110128235114.000|20110128235116.000|TR0|addressed the many issues related to the 
20110128235116.000|20110128235118.000|TR0|developments in Egypt and many of the 
20110128235118.000|20110128235120.000|TR0|issues that he did raise were also covered 
20110128235120.000|20110128235122.000|TR0|by President Mubarak, addressed to the 
20110128235122.000|20110128235124.000|TR0|nation this evening.
20110128235124.000|20110128235127.000|TR0|
20110128235127.000|20110128235129.000|TR0|In terms of responding to the calls of the 
20110128235129.000|20110128235131.000|TR0|demonstrators for reform, for greater 
20110128235131.000|20110128235133.000|TR0|democracy, for economic development, for 
20110128235133.000|20110128235135.000|TR0|taking into consideration all of their 
20110128235135.000|20110128235137.000|TR0|aspirations.
20110128235137.000|20110128235139.000|TR0|
20110128235139.000|20110128235142.000|TR0|So on many of the issues, both President 
20110128235142.000|20110128235144.000|TR0|Mubarak and President Obama addressed 
20110128235144.000|20110128235146.000|TR0|similar issues.  And the President Mubarak 
20110128235146.000|20110128235148.000|TR0|indicated that he would be asking his new 
20110128235148.000|20110128235150.000|TR0|government to implement wide-range reforms.
20110128235150.000|20110128235152.000|TR0|
20110128235152.000|20110128235154.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Behind the scenes, Ambassador, 
20110128235154.000|20110128235156.000|TR0|U.S. officials tell us they were 
20110128235156.000|20110128235159.000|TR0|disappointed in President Mubarak's 
20110128235159.000|20110128235201.000|TR0|speech.  Do you know whether President -- 
20110128235201.000|20110128235203.000|TR0|President Obama spoke with President 
20110128235203.000|20110128235205.000|TR0|Mubarak before or after President 
20110128235205.000|20110128235207.000|TR0|Mubarak's speech?
20110128235207.000|20110128235209.000|TR0|
20110128235209.000|20110128235211.000|TR0|SHOUKRY:  I'm only aware of what President 
20110128235211.000|20110128235213.000|TR0|Obama indicated in his statement.  I took 
20110128235213.000|20110128235216.000|TR0|it that he spoke to him after his speech.
20110128235216.000|20110128235218.000|TR0|
20110128235218.000|20110128235220.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I did, too.
20110128235220.000|20110128235222.000|TR0|
20110128235222.000|20110128235224.000|TR0|SHOUKRY:  That was my understanding.
20110128235224.000|20110128235226.000|TR0|
20110128235226.000|20110128235228.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I did, too.  And the question 
20110128235228.000|20110128235231.000|TR0|is, would it have been better if the 
20110128235231.000|20110128235233.000|TR0|president of the United States expressed 
20110128235233.000|20110128235235.000|TR0|his concerns directly to President Mubarak 
20110128235235.000|20110128235237.000|TR0|before President Mubarak addressed the 
20110128235237.000|20110128235239.000|TR0|Egyptian people so he fully appreciated 
20110128235239.000|20110128235241.000|TR0|where the United States, for example, 
20110128235241.000|20110128235243.000|TR0|stands?
20110128235243.000|20110128235245.000|TR0|
20110128235245.000|20110128235248.000|TR0|SHOUKRY:  There have been communications 
20110128235248.000|20110128235250.000|TR0|during these last days, very direct 
20110128235250.000|20110128235252.000|TR0|communications between two governments 
20110128235252.000|20110128235254.000|TR0|where many issues raised by the president 
20110128235254.000|20110128235256.000|TR0|have already been conveyed.
20110128235256.000|20110128235258.000|TR0|
20110128235258.000|20110128235300.000|TR0|BLITZER:  How worried are you that what 
20110128235300.000|20110128235303.000|TR0|we're seeing in Cairo, and Alexandria and 
20110128235303.000|20110128235305.000|TR0|elsewhere, Mr. Ambassador, that these 
20110128235305.000|20110128235307.000|TR0|demonstrations will merely escalate 
20110128235307.000|20110128235309.000|TR0|Saturday on the streets, that a lot of 
20110128235309.000|20110128235311.000|TR0|people really were disappointed and angry 
20110128235311.000|20110128235313.000|TR0|at President Mubarak's statement?
20110128235313.000|20110128235315.000|TR0|
20110128235315.000|20110128235317.000|TR0|SHOUKRY:  Well, I think we have to monitor 
20110128235317.000|20110128235320.000|TR0|the reaction.  I think it's too early.  I 
20110128235320.000|20110128235322.000|TR0|don't have direct knowledge of what is 
20110128235322.000|20110128235324.000|TR0|currently on the street.  And I think it 
20110128235324.000|20110128235326.000|TR0|is too early to assess.  I think there is 
20110128235326.000|20110128235328.000|TR0|an expectation of what the new government, 
20110128235328.000|20110128235330.000|TR0|how it will be composed, and what the 
20110128235330.000|20110128235332.000|TR0|directions and the reform that it might 
20110128235332.000|20110128235334.000|TR0|declare.  So I think it's better not to 
20110128235334.000|20110128235337.000|TR0|speculate.
20110128235337.000|20110128235339.000|TR0|
20110128235339.000|20110128235341.000|TR0|BLITZER:  What is next in line, though?  
20110128235341.000|20110128235343.000|TR0|And I don't know if this is going to 
20110128235343.000|20110128235345.000|TR0|happen.  No one knows.  If President 
20110128235345.000|20110128235347.000|TR0|Mubarak were forced to step down, leave 
20110128235347.000|20110128235349.000|TR0|office, who's next in line?  Who would 
20110128235349.000|20110128235352.000|TR0|take over?
20110128235352.000|20110128235354.000|TR0|
20110128235354.000|20110128235356.000|TR0|SHOUKRY:  Well, again, that's rather 
20110128235356.000|20110128235358.000|TR0|speculative.  But in terms of our 
20110128235358.000|20110128235400.000|TR0|constitution, the constitution clearly 
20110128235400.000|20110128235402.000|TR0|defines that the -- in the case the 
20110128235402.000|20110128235404.000|TR0|president is unable to undertake his 
20110128235404.000|20110128235406.000|TR0|responsibilities, the speaker of 
20110128235406.000|20110128235409.000|TR0|parliament undertakes that responsibility 
20110128235409.000|20110128235411.000|TR0|until elections are conducted in the span 
20110128235411.000|20110128235413.000|TR0|of 60 days.  Again, this is a matter of 
20110128235413.000|20110128235415.000|TR0|constitutional law.
20110128235415.000|20110128235417.000|TR0|
20110128235417.000|20110128235419.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And one final question, Mr. 
20110128235419.000|20110128235421.000|TR0|Ambassador, before I let you go.  Do you 
20110128235421.000|20110128235424.000|TR0|know the whereabouts of President 
20110128235424.000|20110128235426.000|TR0|Mubarak's wife and son, Gamal?      
20110128235426.000|20110128235428.000|TR0|SHOUKRY:  I have no direct knowledge.  
20110128235428.000|20110128235430.000|TR0|Although Gamal was part of the NDP, the 
20110128235430.000|20110128235432.000|TR0|National Democratic Party's main body.  He 
20110128235432.000|20110128235434.000|TR0|attended the meeting yesterday and was 
20110128235434.000|20110128235436.000|TR0|clearly visible in Cairo.
20110128235436.000|20110128235438.000|TR0|
20110128235438.000|20110128235441.000|TR0|BLITZER:  He was in Cairo as of yesterday. 
20110128235441.000|20110128235443.000|TR0| And Mrs. Mubarak, do you know where she 
20110128235443.000|20110128235445.000|TR0|is?
20110128235445.000|20110128235447.000|TR0|
20110128235447.000|20110128235449.000|TR0|SHOUKRY:  I have no direct knowledge.
20110128235449.000|20110128235451.000|TR0|
20110128235451.000|20110128235453.000|TR0|BLITZER:  You heard the reports that, at 
20110128235453.000|20110128235455.000|TR0|political headquarters of President 
20110128235455.000|20110128235458.000|TR0|Mubarak's party was ransacked, burned, 
20110128235458.000|20110128235500.000|TR0|looted today.  You heard those reports?
20110128235500.000|20110128235502.000|TR0|
20110128235502.000|20110128235504.000|TR0|SHOUKRY:  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have.
20110128235504.000|20110128235506.000|TR0|
20110128235506.000|20110128235508.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  So we'll stay in

20110128235525.000|20110128235527.000|TR0|We're staying on top of the breaking news

20110128235540.000|20110128235542.000|TR0|BLITZER:  They're watching all the 
20110128235542.000|20110128235545.000|TR0|breaking news in Egypt very, very 
20110128235545.000|20110128235547.000|TR0|carefully over at the Pentagon, which has 
20110128235547.000|20110128235549.000|TR0|very close ties to the Egyptian military.  
20110128235549.000|20110128235551.000|TR0|Our Pentagon correspondent, Chris 
20110128235551.000|20110128235553.000|TR0|Lawrence, is joining us now with more on 
20110128235553.000|20110128235555.000|TR0|what's going on there.
20110128235555.000|20110128235557.000|TR0|
20110128235557.000|20110128235559.000|TR0|Chris, set the scene for us.
20110128235559.000|20110128235602.000|TR0|
20110128235602.000|20110128235604.000|TR0|CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110128235604.000|20110128235606.000|TR0|Wolf, some of Egypt's highest-ranking 
20110128235606.000|20110128235608.000|TR0|military officers have now left the 
20110128235608.000|20110128235610.000|TR0|Pentagon and are rushing home to deal with 
20110128235610.000|20110128235612.000|TR0|the crisis there.
20110128235612.000|20110128235614.000|TR0|
20110128235614.000|20110128235616.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
20110128235616.000|20110128235619.000|TR0|
20110128235619.000|20110128235621.000|TR0|LAWRENCE (voice-over):  While armored 
20110128235621.000|20110128235623.000|TR0|vehicles rumbled through Cairo's streets, 
20110128235623.000|20110128235625.000|TR0|some of Egypt's top military officials 
20110128235625.000|20110128235627.000|TR0|were huddled in, of all places, the 
20110128235627.000|20110128235629.000|TR0|Pentagon.
20110128235629.000|20110128235631.000|TR0|
20110128235631.000|20110128235634.000|TR0|GEN.      JAMES CARTWRIGHT, VICE CHAIRMAN, 
20110128235634.000|20110128235636.000|TR0|JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: It would be hard to 
20110128235636.000|20110128235638.000|TR0|have ignored the fact that -- you know, 
20110128235638.000|20110128235640.000|TR0|that this was going on.  And it wasn't 
20110128235640.000|20110128235642.000|TR0|ignored.
20110128235642.000|20110128235644.000|TR0|
20110128235644.000|20110128235646.000|TR0|LAWRENCE:  The high-ranking officers cut 
20110128235646.000|20110128235648.000|TR0|short their previously scheduled meetings 
20110128235648.000|20110128235651.000|TR0|with Pentagon officials to rush back to 
20110128235651.000|20110128235653.000|TR0|Egypt.  But not before U.S. officials 
20110128235653.000|20110128235655.000|TR0|urged their Egyptian counterparts to 
20110128235655.000|20110128235657.000|TR0|handle protesters peacefully.
20110128235657.000|20110128235659.000|TR0|
20110128235659.000|20110128235701.000|TR0|CARTWRIGHT:  But the key activity here, I 
20110128235701.000|20110128235703.000|TR0|think, that's really important is to 
20110128235703.000|20110128235706.000|TR0|exercise restraint.  And to do so, both on 
20110128235706.000|20110128235708.000|TR0|our part but also on the part of our 
20110128235708.000|20110128235710.000|TR0|counterparts in the Egyptian military.
20110128235710.000|20110128235712.000|TR0|
20110128235712.000|20110128235714.000|TR0|LAWRENCE:  And the U.S. has some leverage 
20110128235714.000|20110128235716.000|TR0|with its ally.  Every other year, up to 
20110128235716.000|20110128235718.000|TR0|10,000 American troops train with Egyptian 
20110128235718.000|20110128235720.000|TR0|soldiers, the largest military exercise in 
20110128235720.000|20110128235723.000|TR0|the region.  The U.S. gives Egypt well 
20110128235723.000|20110128235725.000|TR0|over $1 billion a year in assistance.  
20110128235725.000|20110128235727.000|TR0|It's outfitted Egypt with fighter jets, 
20110128235727.000|20110128235729.000|TR0|Apache helicopters, M-1 tanks and 
20110128235729.000|20110128235731.000|TR0|surveillance equipment.
20110128235731.000|20110128235733.000|TR0|
20110128235733.000|20110128235735.000|TR0|The last thing the Pentagon wants are 
20110128235735.000|20110128235737.000|TR0|those weapons in the hands of a government 
20110128235737.000|20110128235740.000|TR0|hostile to the United States.
20110128235740.000|20110128235742.000|TR0|
20110128235742.000|20110128235744.000|TR0|KEN POLLACK, SABAN CENTER/BROOKINGS 
20110128235744.000|20110128235746.000|TR0|INSTITUTION:  In some ways, that is one of 
20110128235746.000|20110128235748.000|TR0|America's worst nightmares.
20110128235748.000|20110128235750.000|TR0|
20110128235750.000|20110128235752.000|TR0|LAWRENCE:  But Ken Pollack at the 
20110128235752.000|20110128235755.000|TR0|Brookings Institution says it's not 
20110128235755.000|20110128235757.000|TR0|because the weapons are so sophisticated 
20110128235757.000|20110128235759.000|TR0|or will harm the U.S. It's symbolic.
20110128235759.000|20110128235801.000|TR0|
20110128235801.000|20110128235803.000|TR0|POLLACK:  Because it will once again be 
20110128235803.000|20110128235805.000|TR0|another major American ally whom the 
20110128235805.000|20110128235807.000|TR0|United States armed to the teeth, suddenly 
20110128235807.000|20110128235809.000|TR0|overthrown by a population that he 
20110128235809.000|20110128235812.000|TR0|repressed for so long and that the United 
20110128235812.000|20110128235814.000|TR0|States ignored.
20110128235814.000|20110128235816.000|TR0|
20110128235816.000|20110128235818.000|TR0|LAWRENCE:  It seems unlikely now.  
20110128235818.000|20110128235820.000|TR0|Protesters who fought police actually 
20110128235820.000|20110128235822.000|TR0|cheered the Egyptian army.  And the 
20110128235822.000|20110128235824.000|TR0|militant Muslim Brotherhood is not 
20110128235824.000|20110128235827.000|TR0|controlling these protests.
20110128235827.000|20110128235829.000|TR0|
20110128235829.000|20110128235831.000|TR0|But Pollack says 30 years ago, Iran's 
20110128235831.000|20110128235833.000|TR0|Islamic Revolution started as a 
20110128235833.000|20110128235835.000|TR0|middle-class revolt.
20110128235835.000|20110128235837.000|TR0|
20110128235837.000|20110128235839.000|TR0|POLLACK:  Revolutions are extremely 
20110128235839.000|20110128235841.000|TR0|unpredictable events.  And the people who 
20110128235841.000|20110128235844.000|TR0|begin the revolution aren't always the 
20110128235844.000|20110128235846.000|TR0|people who wind up ending them.

20110128235852.000|20110128235854.000|TR0|LAWRENCE:  There are more than 600 
20110128235854.000|20110128235856.000|TR0|American troops in Egypt right now and a 
20110128235856.000|20110128235858.000|TR0|contingency plan to evacuate the U.S. 
20110128235858.000|20110128235901.000|TR0|embassy in Cairo.  But the embassy staff 
20110128235901.000|20110128235903.000|TR0|has not asked for that, and military 
20110128235903.000|20110128235905.000|TR0|officials say the situation hasn't gotten 
20110128235905.000|20110128235907.000|TR0|to that point yet -- Wolf.

20110128235909.000|20110128235911.000|TR0|BLITZER:  They always have contingency 
20110128235911.000|20110128235913.000|TR0|plans over at the Pentagon, and we're 
20110128235913.000|20110128235916.000|TR0|happy about that.  Thank you.  Let's hope
