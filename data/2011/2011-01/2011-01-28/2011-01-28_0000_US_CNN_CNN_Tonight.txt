20110128000007.000|20110128000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST:  Thanks Wolf and good 
20110128000009.000|20110128000011.000|TR0|evening everyone.  A lot of breaking 
20110128000011.000|20110128000013.000|TR0|political news tonight, another big staff 
20110128000013.000|20110128000016.000|TR0|shakeup at the Obama White House, this one 
20110128000016.000|20110128000018.000|TR0|bearing the clear imprint of the 
20110128000018.000|20110128000020.000|TR0|president's new chief of staff and a big 
20110128000020.000|20110128000022.000|TR0|mayoral debate next hour in Chicago.
20110128000022.000|20110128000025.000|TR0|
20110128000025.000|20110128000027.000|TR0|Former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel 
20110128000027.000|20110128000029.000|TR0|will be there thanks to a court ruling 
20110128000029.000|20110128000032.000|TR0|reviving his candidacy.  Plus, the 
20110128000032.000|20110128000034.000|TR0|inaugural meeting of the Senate Tea Party 
20110128000034.000|20110128000036.000|TR0|caucus, and who didn't come is generating 
20110128000036.000|20110128000038.000|TR0|as much buzz as who did.
20110128000038.000|20110128000041.000|TR0|
20110128000041.000|20110128000043.000|TR0|But we begin with 2012 presidential 
20110128000043.000|20110128000045.000|TR0|politics and a big decision that will help 
20110128000045.000|20110128000047.000|TR0|shape the contest for the Republican 
20110128000047.000|20110128000050.000|TR0|nomination. Conservative Congressman Mike 
20110128000050.000|20110128000052.000|TR0|Pence of Indiana just announced he will 
20110128000052.000|20110128000054.000|TR0|not run for president in 2012, and instead 
20110128000054.000|20110128000057.000|TR0|will explore running for governor of 
20110128000057.000|20110128000059.000|TR0|Indiana.  So why does this matter?
20110128000059.000|20110128000101.000|TR0|
20110128000101.000|20110128000103.000|TR0|Yes, Pence is a relatively obscure House 
20110128000103.000|20110128000106.000|TR0|member.  He would have been a long shot if 
20110128000106.000|20110128000108.000|TR0|he did run.  But he's a favorite of both 
20110128000108.000|20110128000110.000|TR0|economic and social conservatives, and he 
20110128000110.000|20110128000112.000|TR0|was lobbied heavily in recent weeks by 
20110128000112.000|20110128000115.000|TR0|important grassroots Republicans and Tea 
20110128000115.000|20110128000117.000|TR0|Party leaders who played a big role in his 
20110128000117.000|20110128000119.000|TR0|past campaign and who find the current 
20110128000119.000|20110128000122.000|TR0|list of Republican prospects, as long as 
20110128000122.000|20110128000124.000|TR0|it is, to be lacking.
20110128000124.000|20110128000126.000|TR0|
20110128000126.000|20110128000128.000|TR0|A lot to dissect tonight with CNN 
20110128000128.000|20110128000131.000|TR0|contributors John Avlon, John Brabender is 
20110128000131.000|20110128000133.000|TR0|a Republican strategist, Donna Brazile and 
20110128000133.000|20110128000135.000|TR0|our Gloria Borger.  Let's begin and John I 
20110128000135.000|20110128000137.000|TR0|want to start with you.  As a Republican 
20110128000137.000|20110128000140.000|TR0|strategist, you are close to Rick 
20110128000140.000|20110128000142.000|TR0|Santorum, another prospect in this race.  
20110128000142.000|20110128000144.000|TR0|What is it?
20110128000144.000|20110128000147.000|TR0|
20110128000147.000|20110128000149.000|TR0|The Republican Party has always been the 
20110128000149.000|20110128000151.000|TR0|party of a front-runner. You know coming 
20110128000151.000|20110128000153.000|TR0|into the cycle, that's the lead guy.  Some 
20110128000153.000|20110128000156.000|TR0|people say maybe that's Mitt Romney, the 
20110128000156.000|20110128000158.000|TR0|former Massachusetts governor.  But what 
20110128000158.000|20110128000200.000|TR0|is it that had Tea Party people who were 
20110128000200.000|20110128000202.000|TR0|very important in last year's election, 
20110128000202.000|20110128000205.000|TR0|other grassroots Republicans, very 
20110128000205.000|20110128000207.000|TR0|important, going to Mike Pence and saying 
20110128000207.000|20110128000209.000|TR0|please run, we don't like these guys?
20110128000209.000|20110128000212.000|TR0|
20110128000212.000|20110128000214.000|TR0|JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN MEDIA 
20110128000214.000|20110128000216.000|TR0|CONSULTANT:  Well first it's a different 
20110128000216.000|20110128000218.000|TR0|Republican Party.  You've got to 
20110128000218.000|20110128000221.000|TR0|understand we're now broken into the Tea 
20110128000221.000|20110128000223.000|TR0|Party side of the party and the social 
20110128000223.000|20110128000225.000|TR0|conservative side of the party and then 
20110128000225.000|20110128000228.000|TR0|everybody else.  What was attractive about 
20110128000228.000|20110128000230.000|TR0|Mike Pence was everybody of those groups 
20110128000230.000|20110128000232.000|TR0|liked him.  Social conservatives 
20110128000232.000|20110128000234.000|TR0|particularly are unhappy because these 
20110128000234.000|20110128000237.000|TR0|days we have a lot of people that will 
20110128000237.000|20110128000239.000|TR0|check the box.     They're pro-life, 
20110128000239.000|20110128000241.000|TR0|pro-marriage, whatever, but they're not 
20110128000241.000|20110128000243.000|TR0|out there every day talking about the 
20110128000243.000|20110128000246.000|TR0|issue.  They're not passionate about it.  
20110128000246.000|20110128000248.000|TR0|Mike Pence was somebody that was and so 
20110128000248.000|20110128000250.000|TR0|winning the nomination, particularly in 
20110128000250.000|20110128000253.000|TR0|early states is about planning your flag 
20110128000253.000|20110128000255.000|TR0|and having some real estate.  That is now 
20110128000255.000|20110128000257.000|TR0|real estate that is open and should help 
20110128000257.000|20110128000259.000|TR0|some of the other social conservative 
20110128000259.000|20110128000302.000|TR0|candidates.
20110128000302.000|20110128000304.000|TR0|
20110128000304.000|20110128000306.000|TR0|KING:  You say others.  Hang on just one 
20110128000306.000|20110128000308.000|TR0|sec, Gloria.  I want you in because it's 
20110128000308.000|20110128000311.000|TR0|374 days, sounds like a long time if 
20110128000311.000|20110128000313.000|TR0|you're watching at home, but it's 374 days 
20110128000313.000|20110128000315.000|TR0|to the Iowa caucuses.  And that's what 
20110128000315.000|20110128000318.000|TR0|kicks off the campaign.  This much we know.
20110128000318.000|20110128000320.000|TR0|
20110128000320.000|20110128000322.000|TR0|When you're thinking about the White House 
20110128000322.000|20110128000324.000|TR0|and the next campaign, who is the 
20110128000324.000|20110128000327.000|TR0|Democratic candidate?  Well we know.  It's 
20110128000327.000|20110128000329.000|TR0|one guy.  Maybe some fringe Democrat will 
20110128000329.000|20110128000331.000|TR0|challenge him.  That's unlikely.  He will 
20110128000331.000|20110128000333.000|TR0|be the Democratic nominee.  Case closed.  
20110128000333.000|20110128000336.000|TR0|That's what makes this part so interesting.
20110128000336.000|20110128000338.000|TR0|
20110128000338.000|20110128000340.000|TR0|You move the president over here and you 
20110128000340.000|20110128000343.000|TR0|say who is going to come in from the 
20110128000343.000|20110128000345.000|TR0|right?  And who wants to live here who 
20110128000345.000|20110128000347.000|TR0|will come in from the right?  I'll get you 
20110128000347.000|20110128000349.000|TR0|to move over a little bit -- just got to 
20110128000349.000|20110128000352.000|TR0|be nice -- and here's what gets very 
20110128000352.000|20110128000354.000|TR0|interesting because you get a collection 
20110128000354.000|20110128000356.000|TR0|of people who just come up here.
20110128000356.000|20110128000358.000|TR0|
20110128000358.000|20110128000401.000|TR0|And you look -- more than a dozen people 
20110128000401.000|20110128000403.000|TR0|here.  Some of these are definite 
20110128000403.000|20110128000405.000|TR0|candidates.  Some of them are maybe 
20110128000405.000|20110128000408.000|TR0|candidates.  Some have said repeatedly oh 
20110128000408.000|20110128000410.000|TR0|no way.  But if you look, former Governor 
20110128000410.000|20110128000412.000|TR0|Pawlenty, Governor Jindal has said no, 
20110128000412.000|20110128000414.000|TR0|former Governor Romney most definitely 
20110128000414.000|20110128000417.000|TR0|running.  Governor Barbour maybe, Jim 
20110128000417.000|20110128000419.000|TR0|DeMint told Wolf Blitzer yesterday no.
20110128000419.000|20110128000421.000|TR0|
20110128000421.000|20110128000423.000|TR0|His people tell us today well he's going 
20110128000423.000|20110128000426.000|TR0|to Iowa (INAUDIBLE). We'll think about it 
20110128000426.000|20110128000428.000|TR0|and you look and you look.  Governor 
20110128000428.000|20110128000430.000|TR0|Palin, of course, then there's Mike Pence; 
20110128000430.000|20110128000433.000|TR0|he's the guy tonight who we will take him 
20110128000433.000|20110128000435.000|TR0|out of the picture.  And if you look at 
20110128000435.000|20110128000437.000|TR0|this, Gloria Borger, some people who have 
20110128000437.000|20110128000439.000|TR0|run before, Rick Santorum, one of John's 
20110128000439.000|20110128000442.000|TR0|candidates, the Donald says he might get 
20110128000442.000|20110128000444.000|TR0|in.  But there are a number of people 
20110128000444.000|20110128000446.000|TR0|here, you look, yes, OK, there's a good 
20110128000446.000|20110128000449.000|TR0|resume there.  Senator Thune says he will 
20110128000449.000|20110128000451.000|TR0|tell us next month.  A lot of people and 
20110128000451.000|20110128000453.000|TR0|yet not a lot of excitement at the 
20110128000453.000|20110128000455.000|TR0|grassroots level of the party looking at 
20110128000455.000|20110128000458.000|TR0|this group.
20110128000458.000|20110128000500.000|TR0|
20110128000500.000|20110128000502.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110128000502.000|20110128000504.000|TR0|ANALYST:  You know I think they're looking 
20110128000504.000|20110128000507.000|TR0|for somebody they haven't seen before, 
20110128000507.000|20110128000509.000|TR0|John, right? And so they look at Mike 
20110128000509.000|20110128000511.000|TR0|Huckabee, who is very appealing to social 
20110128000511.000|20110128000514.000|TR0|conservatives, but he's run before, and he 
20110128000514.000|20110128000516.000|TR0|lost before.  Rick Santorum, same kind of 
20110128000516.000|20110128000518.000|TR0|situation.  They know him.  They know him, 
20110128000518.000|20110128000520.000|TR0|you know --
20110128000520.000|20110128000523.000|TR0|
20110128000523.000|20110128000525.000|TR0|BRABENDER:  Why are you telling me?
20110128000525.000|20110128000527.000|TR0|
20110128000527.000|20110128000529.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110128000529.000|20110128000532.000|TR0|
20110128000532.000|20110128000534.000|TR0|BORGER:  And so and of course, you know, 
20110128000534.000|20110128000536.000|TR0|the person we're not talking about is 
20110128000536.000|20110128000539.000|TR0|below the "R" (ph), Sarah Palin.  And 
20110128000539.000|20110128000541.000|TR0|that's -- you know that's the elephant 
20110128000541.000|20110128000543.000|TR0|sitting in the room, literally, which is, 
20110128000543.000|20110128000545.000|TR0|is she going to run or not?  And they're 
20110128000545.000|20110128000548.000|TR0|afraid of who gets in first because if you 
20110128000548.000|20110128000550.000|TR0|get in first, high expectations.  You've 
20110128000550.000|20110128000552.000|TR0|got to raise a lot of money, and then what 
20110128000552.000|20110128000554.000|TR0|if Sarah Palin comes in late and takes 
20110128000554.000|20110128000557.000|TR0|away all your steam and blows the field 
20110128000557.000|20110128000559.000|TR0|away --
20110128000559.000|20110128000601.000|TR0|
20110128000601.000|20110128000604.000|TR0|KING:  And John Avlon, you used to write 
20110128000604.000|20110128000606.000|TR0|speeches for Rudy Giuliani.  He told Piers 
20110128000606.000|20110128000608.000|TR0|Morgan last week maybe, maybe most people 
20110128000608.000|20110128000610.000|TR0|think that's unlikely because frankly, he 
20110128000610.000|20110128000613.000|TR0|just bombed last time.  But to John's 
20110128000613.000|20110128000615.000|TR0|point about this is a new Republican 
20110128000615.000|20110128000617.000|TR0|Party.  It's that uncertainty.
20110128000617.000|20110128000619.000|TR0|
20110128000619.000|20110128000622.000|TR0|The Republicans used to be the predictable 
20110128000622.000|20110128000624.000|TR0|party.  We were pretty certain it would be 
20110128000624.000|20110128000626.000|TR0|Bob Dole.  We were pretty certain it would 
20110128000626.000|20110128000629.000|TR0|be George W. Bush.  Then we were pretty 
20110128000629.000|20110128000631.000|TR0|certain -- it was a little rocky, but it 
20110128000631.000|20110128000633.000|TR0|ended up being John McCain, who was the 
20110128000633.000|20110128000635.000|TR0|front-runner at the beginning.  This is a 
20110128000635.000|20110128000638.000|TR0|brand new "huh" when you look at the 
20110128000638.000|20110128000640.000|TR0|Republican field.
20110128000640.000|20110128000642.000|TR0|
20110128000642.000|20110128000644.000|TR0|JOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well I mean 
20110128000644.000|20110128000647.000|TR0|as you say, Republican Party usually goes 
20110128000647.000|20110128000649.000|TR0|with the conventional wisdom frontrunner 
20110128000649.000|20110128000651.000|TR0|and by most accounts that's Mitt Romney, 
20110128000651.000|20110128000654.000|TR0|but because of the health care bill in 
20110128000654.000|20110128000656.000|TR0|Massachusetts and other reasons, he does 
20110128000656.000|20110128000658.000|TR0|not have that grassroots support.  And you 
20110128000658.000|20110128000700.000|TR0|are looking at a wide open field, at a 
20110128000700.000|20110128000703.000|TR0|party that's sort of in war lord status.
20110128000703.000|20110128000705.000|TR0|
20110128000705.000|20110128000707.000|TR0|And I think John made an interesting 
20110128000707.000|20110128000710.000|TR0|point, though, pulling the curtain back 
20110128000710.000|20110128000712.000|TR0|that for all the focus on fiscal issues, 
20110128000712.000|20110128000714.000|TR0|for the Tea Party that social conservatism 
20110128000714.000|20110128000716.000|TR0|is really the driving factor litmus test 
20110128000716.000|20110128000719.000|TR0|for many of these activist groups.  That's 
20110128000719.000|20110128000721.000|TR0|sort of the untold truth.  The other 
20110128000721.000|20110128000723.000|TR0|elephant in the living room is that it's 
20110128000723.000|20110128000725.000|TR0|not a particularly strong field right now. 
20110128000725.000|20110128000728.000|TR0| And the Republican Party is going to have 
20110128000728.000|20110128000730.000|TR0|to deal with that.
20110128000730.000|20110128000732.000|TR0|
20110128000732.000|20110128000735.000|TR0|KING:  Donna Brazile, when you look at the 
20110128000735.000|20110128000737.000|TR0|field of the Republicans, you did this for 
20110128000737.000|20110128000739.000|TR0|Al Gore back in 2000, came pretty close. 
20110128000739.000|20110128000741.000|TR0|Let's not re-litigate that one.
20110128000741.000|20110128000744.000|TR0|
20110128000744.000|20110128000746.000|TR0|DONNA BRAZILE, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  
20110128000746.000|20110128000748.000|TR0|No, let's not.
20110128000748.000|20110128000750.000|TR0|
20110128000750.000|20110128000753.000|TR0|KING:  But if you look at this field, 
20110128000753.000|20110128000755.000|TR0|where we are now.  And where we are now 
20110128000755.000|20110128000757.000|TR0|could be completely different from where 
20110128000757.000|20110128000800.000|TR0|we are down the road.  But the 
20110128000800.000|20110128000802.000|TR0|Congressional Budget Office says look for 
20110128000802.000|20110128000804.000|TR0|eight percent unemployment around election 
20110128000804.000|20110128000806.000|TR0|time in 2012.  So it will be a tough 
20110128000806.000|20110128000809.000|TR0|climate for the incumbent president, even 
20110128000809.000|20110128000811.000|TR0|if people are feeling a little better 
20110128000811.000|20110128000813.000|TR0|about the economy.  When you look at that 
20110128000813.000|20110128000815.000|TR0|list of people, does anybody there jump 
20110128000815.000|20110128000818.000|TR0|out, and you say that's the profile, 
20110128000818.000|20110128000820.000|TR0|that's the person I would not want to run 
20110128000820.000|20110128000822.000|TR0|against in a tough economy?
20110128000822.000|20110128000825.000|TR0|
20110128000825.000|20110128000827.000|TR0|BRAZILE:  Actually, the Republican Party 
20110128000827.000|20110128000829.000|TR0|faces a stature gap.  We saw in 2010 the 
20110128000829.000|20110128000831.000|TR0|Democrats with an enthusiasm gap.  I think 
20110128000831.000|20110128000834.000|TR0|they're looking for somebody who cannot 
20110128000834.000|20110128000836.000|TR0|only rally the Tea Party regulars, but 
20110128000836.000|20110128000838.000|TR0|also appeal to some of what I call the 
20110128000838.000|20110128000840.000|TR0|regular Republicans.  So they have a big 
20110128000840.000|20110128000843.000|TR0|job on their hands.  But I want to say 
20110128000843.000|20110128000845.000|TR0|this about Mike Pence, since I also worked 
20110128000845.000|20110128000847.000|TR0|for Dick Gephardt back in the day.  It's 
20110128000847.000|20110128000850.000|TR0|been over 131 years since we've elected 
20110128000850.000|20110128000852.000|TR0|somebody directly from the House of 
20110128000852.000|20110128000854.000|TR0|Representatives to the oval office.  While 
20110128000854.000|20110128000856.000|TR0|we've had 15 presidents who have served in 
20110128000856.000|20110128000859.000|TR0|the House of Representatives most members 
20110128000859.000|20110128000901.000|TR0|of Congress especially on the House side 
20110128000901.000|20110128000903.000|TR0|know that it's very difficult to go 
20110128000903.000|20110128000906.000|TR0|straight to oval office.
20110128000906.000|20110128000908.000|TR0|
20110128000908.000|20110128000910.000|TR0|KING:  At 51 years old, he's going to try 
20110128000910.000|20110128000912.000|TR0|to be governor of Indiana --
20110128000912.000|20110128000915.000|TR0|
20110128000915.000|20110128000917.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110128000917.000|20110128000919.000|TR0|
20110128000919.000|20110128000921.000|TR0|KING:  I suspect we'll be having a 
20110128000921.000|20110128000924.000|TR0|conversation about Pence for president 
20110128000924.000|20110128000926.000|TR0|down the road a little bit.
20110128000926.000|20110128000928.000|TR0|
20110128000928.000|20110128000931.000|TR0|But let's move on to another breaking 
20110128000931.000|20110128000933.000|TR0|political story tonight. The candidates 
20110128000933.000|20110128000935.000|TR0|for Chicago mayor will debate next hour.  
20110128000935.000|20110128000937.000|TR0|And Rahm Emanuel will be there, and again, 
20110128000937.000|20110128000940.000|TR0|as the race's certain front-runner. Ending 
20110128000940.000|20110128000942.000|TR0|a roller coaster week, even by Chicago 
20110128000942.000|20110128000944.000|TR0|politic standards the Illinois Supreme 
20110128000944.000|20110128000946.000|TR0|Court last hour ruled the former 
20110128000946.000|20110128000949.000|TR0|congressman and White House chief of staff 
20110128000949.000|20110128000951.000|TR0|is eligible to run for mayor.  A lower 
20110128000951.000|20110128000953.000|TR0|court earlier this week you'll remember 
20110128000953.000|20110128000956.000|TR0|had said Emanuel did not meet a strict 
20110128000956.000|20110128000958.000|TR0|residency requirement.  Our national 
20110128000958.000|20110128001000.000|TR0|political correspondent Jessica Yellin is 
20110128001000.000|20110128001002.000|TR0|tracking that drama and Jess, a drama it 
20110128001002.000|20110128001005.000|TR0|is.
20110128001005.000|20110128001007.000|TR0|
20110128001007.000|20110128001009.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL 
20110128001009.000|20110128001011.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:   It really is, John.  You 
20110128001011.000|20110128001014.000|TR0|know this was also a resounding victory 
20110128001014.000|20110128001016.000|TR0|for Rahm Emanuel.  They were on pins and 
20110128001016.000|20110128001018.000|TR0|needles in Chicago, not only his campaign, 
20110128001018.000|20110128001021.000|TR0|but the other campaigns just waiting to 
20110128001021.000|20110128001023.000|TR0|see how this would all shake out.  It was 
20110128001023.000|20110128001025.000|TR0|a unanimous decision finding that Rahm 
20110128001025.000|20110128001027.000|TR0|Emanuel does meet the residency 
20110128001027.000|20110128001030.000|TR0|requirements, and a pretty scathing view 
20110128001030.000|20110128001032.000|TR0|of what the lower court ruled.
20110128001032.000|20110128001034.000|TR0|
20110128001034.000|20110128001036.000|TR0|The finding said that for -- what it means 
20110128001036.000|20110128001039.000|TR0|to be a resident for election purposes was 
20110128001039.000|20110128001041.000|TR0|clearly established long ago.  It's been 
20110128001041.000|20110128001043.000|TR0|consistent law since the 19th Century.  
20110128001043.000|20110128001046.000|TR0|They found that the lower court which 
20110128001046.000|20110128001048.000|TR0|ruled against Rahm Emanuel used a quote, 
20110128001048.000|20110128001050.000|TR0|"novel standard that had no foundation in 
20110128001050.000|20110128001052.000|TR0|law" -- pretty harsh to the lower court 
20110128001052.000|20110128001055.000|TR0|and John, so this means game on there.  
20110128001055.000|20110128001057.000|TR0|The debate, you mentioned, begins in an 
20110128001057.000|20110128001059.000|TR0|hour.  Early voting begins on Monday and 
20110128001059.000|20110128001101.000|TR0|this race is off and running.
20110128001101.000|20110128001104.000|TR0|
20110128001104.000|20110128001106.000|TR0|KING:  And they've got to run out and 
20110128001106.000|20110128001108.000|TR0|print some ballots pretty quickly, right?
20110128001108.000|20110128001111.000|TR0|
20110128001111.000|20110128001113.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Yes, they sure do.
20110128001113.000|20110128001115.000|TR0|
20110128001115.000|20110128001117.000|TR0|KING:  Jessica Yellin thanks for tracking 
20110128001117.000|20110128001120.000|TR0|that one.  You know Jess just went through 
20110128001120.000|20110128001122.000|TR0|the legalese there and one of the ways I 
20110128001122.000|20110128001124.000|TR0|would call this is like an NFL replay.  
20110128001124.000|20110128001127.000|TR0|The Chicago Board of Elections, the local 
20110128001127.000|20110128001129.000|TR0|Board of Elections is the first referee 
20110128001129.000|20110128001131.000|TR0|and they ruled one way.
20110128001131.000|20110128001133.000|TR0|
20110128001133.000|20110128001136.000|TR0|And so it got up to the Supreme Court and 
20110128001136.000|20110128001138.000|TR0|they put their head in the booth and they 
20110128001138.000|20110128001140.000|TR0|looked at the replay and they said you 
20110128001140.000|20110128001142.000|TR0|know what, we can't overturn that.  It's 
20110128001142.000|20110128001145.000|TR0|their call to make.  They said he's on the 
20110128001145.000|20110128001147.000|TR0|ballot.  (INAUDIBLE) so the middle part 
20110128001147.000|20110128001149.000|TR0|ended up being just a little bit of drama. 
20110128001149.000|20110128001152.000|TR0| But now do we assume he's the next mayor 
20110128001152.000|20110128001154.000|TR0|of Chicago?
20110128001154.000|20110128001156.000|TR0|
20110128001156.000|20110128001158.000|TR0|BRAZILE:  He has to still get 50 percent 
20110128001158.000|20110128001201.000|TR0|of the vote next -- on February 22nd to 
20110128001201.000|20110128001203.000|TR0|avoid a runoff.  He is clearly the 
20110128001203.000|20110128001205.000|TR0|front-runner in the race.  And I'm sure 
20110128001205.000|20110128001207.000|TR0|tonight now that Carol Moseley Braun and 
20110128001207.000|20110128001210.000|TR0|Mr. Chico and others know that he's on the 
20110128001210.000|20110128001212.000|TR0|ballot, this is probably going to be a 
20110128001212.000|20110128001214.000|TR0|more livelier debate --
20110128001214.000|20110128001217.000|TR0|
20110128001217.000|20110128001219.000|TR0|KING:  It will be a lively event.  
20110128001219.000|20110128001221.000|TR0|However, he also got -- he didn't just get 
20110128001221.000|20110128001223.000|TR0|help from the Illinois Supreme Court 
20110128001223.000|20110128001226.000|TR0|today.  I want you to listen here.  This 
20110128001226.000|20110128001228.000|TR0|is Carol Moseley Braun.  She's on the 
20110128001228.000|20110128001230.000|TR0|radio -- this is last week and she's 
20110128001230.000|20110128001232.000|TR0|talking about why the people of Chicago 
20110128001232.000|20110128001235.000|TR0|should make her their mayor.

20110128001244.000|20110128001246.000|TR0|CANDIDATE:  I'm a product of the Chicago 
20110128001246.000|20110128001248.000|TR0|public schools.  I walked to school in the

20110128001251.000|20110128001253.000|TR0|quality education.  It took me on to a law 
20110128001253.000|20110128001255.000|TR0|degree at the University of Chicago, 
20110128001255.000|20110128001257.000|TR0|advanced degree from Harvard, and I've got

20110128001309.000|20110128001311.000|TR0|advanced degree, singular.  And she does 
20110128001311.000|20110128001313.000|TR0|not have an advanced degrees plural from 
20110128001313.000|20110128001316.000|TR0|Harvard as she said in that interview.  
20110128001316.000|20110128001318.000|TR0|She was a visiting fellow at the Institute 
20110128001318.000|20110128001320.000|TR0|of Politics, which is a great honor.  You

20110128001322.000|20110128001325.000|TR0|people in politics, but you don't get a

20110128001334.000|20110128001336.000|TR0|have a nice certificate, though.

20110128001343.000|20110128001345.000|TR0|KING:  But she was number two in the

20110128001403.000|20110128001406.000|TR0|BORGER:  Well her campaign said she 
20110128001406.000|20110128001408.000|TR0|misspoke.  But she specifically said it 
20110128001408.000|20110128001410.000|TR0|was an advanced degree and while we all 
20110128001410.000|20110128001413.000|TR0|love the Institute of Politics, it does 
20110128001413.000|20110128001415.000|TR0|great work.  It's not an advanced degree.

20110128001451.000|20110128001453.000|TR0|want your views on this one here.  The

20110128001456.000|20110128001458.000|TR0|tonight, a new face to represent President 
20110128001458.000|20110128001500.000|TR0|Obama at a critical time as he navigates 
20110128001500.000|20110128001503.000|TR0|this new more Republican balance of power 
20110128001503.000|20110128001505.000|TR0|here in Washington and as he gears up for

20110128001514.000|20110128001516.000|TR0|answering them.  He's long time reporter 
20110128001516.000|20110128001518.000|TR0|Jay Carney who for the past two years has 
20110128001518.000|20110128001521.000|TR0|been a spokesman for Vice President Joe

20110128001539.000|20110128001541.000|TR0|deft at serving both their boss, the

20110128001615.000|20110128001618.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, I think the 
20110128001618.000|20110128001620.000|TR0|fingerprints of Bill Daley are all over it 
20110128001620.000|20110128001622.000|TR0|from talking to senior Democrats in a 
20110128001622.000|20110128001624.000|TR0|number of ways.  Number one, I've been 
20110128001624.000|20110128001627.000|TR0|told privately that Bill Daley believes 
20110128001627.000|20110128001629.000|TR0|this administration needs to do a better 
20110128001629.000|20110128001631.000|TR0|job of reaching out to the media.  Part of 
20110128001631.000|20110128001634.000|TR0|that is getting more spokesmen out there 
20110128001634.000|20110128001636.000|TR0|and spokeswomen and making sure it's not 
20110128001636.000|20110128001638.000|TR0|just the president carrying the ball on 
20110128001638.000|20110128001640.000|TR0|everything.
20110128001640.000|20110128001643.000|TR0|
20110128001643.000|20110128001645.000|TR0|Daley is going to do his first Sunday show 
20110128001645.000|20110128001647.000|TR0|this weekend on CBS. He thinks Jay Carney 
20110128001647.000|20110128001649.000|TR0|is going to be a bit of a fresh face.  And 
20110128001649.000|20110128001652.000|TR0|he thinks they need to repair some 
20110128001652.000|20110128001654.000|TR0|relations with the media, and maybe Jay 
20110128001654.000|20110128001656.000|TR0|Carney can do that as a former reporter, 
20110128001656.000|20110128001659.000|TR0|but as he was mentioning, it's a tricky 
20110128001659.000|20110128001701.000|TR0|balancing act of who you're serving -- you 
20110128001701.000|20110128001703.000|TR0|know the president or the press.
20110128001703.000|20110128001705.000|TR0|
20110128001705.000|20110128001708.000|TR0|You're sort of trying to walk in the 
20110128001708.000|20110128001710.000|TR0|middle there.  Robert Gibbs was so close 
20110128001710.000|20110128001712.000|TR0|to this the president, sometimes the 
20110128001712.000|20110128001714.000|TR0|balance was a little bit more towards the 
20110128001714.000|20110128001717.000|TR0|president and not serving our needs.  Jay 
20110128001717.000|20110128001719.000|TR0|Carney is going to have to feel his way 
20110128001719.000|20110128001721.000|TR0|through that.  I think the other big 
20110128001721.000|20110128001724.000|TR0|thing, because there was more than just 
20110128001724.000|20110128001726.000|TR0|this.  He brought in some new deputy 
20110128001726.000|20110128001728.000|TR0|chiefs of staff, et cetera.
20110128001728.000|20110128001730.000|TR0|
20110128001730.000|20110128001733.000|TR0|And when you look at the whole picture, 
20110128001733.000|20110128001735.000|TR0|you can ask Donna Brazile this because 
20110128001735.000|20110128001737.000|TR0|I've talked to a lot of people from the 
20110128001737.000|20110128001739.000|TR0|2000 Gore campaign, they say this is Bill 
20110128001739.000|20110128001742.000|TR0|Daley managing a lot of different egos, 
20110128001742.000|20110128001744.000|TR0|moving the charts around, but finding a 
20110128001744.000|20110128001746.000|TR0|way to move the White House forward and 
20110128001746.000|20110128001749.000|TR0|get past any petty turf fights and get 
20110128001749.000|20110128001751.000|TR0|some new fresh blood in there.  And we'll 
20110128001751.000|20110128001753.000|TR0|see how it all works out.
20110128001753.000|20110128001755.000|TR0|
20110128001755.000|20110128001758.000|TR0|KING:  Well let's put the question to 
20110128001758.000|20110128001800.000|TR0|Donna Brazile.  Ed Henry thanks.  It was 
20110128001800.000|20110128001802.000|TR0|interesting because as Ed points, it has 
20110128001802.000|20110128001805.000|TR0|his fingerprints all over it to the point 
20110128001805.000|20110128001807.000|TR0|that the White House when they announced 
20110128001807.000|20110128001809.000|TR0|this released a Bill Daley e-mail to the 
20110128001809.000|20110128001811.000|TR0|staff announcing this.  It wasn't the 
20110128001811.000|20110128001814.000|TR0|press secretary says or the president 
20110128001814.000|20110128001816.000|TR0|says.  It was the chief of staff says.  
20110128001816.000|20110128001818.000|TR0|Why, Donna?
20110128001818.000|20110128001820.000|TR0|
20110128001820.000|20110128001823.000|TR0|BRAZILE:  Because Bill Daley is a great 
20110128001823.000|20110128001825.000|TR0|judge of talent.  He understands the job 
20110128001825.000|20110128001827.000|TR0|that he's been hired to do for the 
20110128001827.000|20110128001830.000|TR0|president, but he also knows the people 
20110128001830.000|20110128001832.000|TR0|that needs to be around the president, 
20110128001832.000|20110128001834.000|TR0|communicating well, working effectively, 
20110128001834.000|20110128001836.000|TR0|so I think this is a great selection.  As 
20110128001836.000|20110128001839.000|TR0|Joe Biden would say, it's a big Biden deal.
20110128001839.000|20110128001841.000|TR0|
20110128001841.000|20110128001843.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110128001843.000|20110128001845.000|TR0|
20110128001845.000|20110128001848.000|TR0|BORGER:  Jay is great, but here's what I 
20110128001848.000|20110128001850.000|TR0|was told also, which is that Bill Daley 
20110128001850.000|20110128001852.000|TR0|really cares about people in the White 
20110128001852.000|20110128001855.000|TR0|House having actual defined 
20110128001855.000|20110128001857.000|TR0|responsibilities.  No more senior adviser 
20110128001857.000|20110128001859.000|TR0|roaming around, going into meetings, 
20110128001859.000|20110128001901.000|TR0|coming up with ideas in the 11th hour.  I 
20110128001901.000|20110128001904.000|TR0|mean he said, look, we want people who 
20110128001904.000|20110128001906.000|TR0|have specific jobs and specific 
20110128001906.000|20110128001908.000|TR0|responsibilities just like they do in 
20110128001908.000|20110128001910.000|TR0|corporate America, right?
20110128001910.000|20110128001913.000|TR0|
20110128001913.000|20110128001915.000|TR0|KING:  And John Avlon, help -- I want John 
20110128001915.000|20110128001917.000|TR0|Avlon first and then John Brabender -- 
20110128001917.000|20110128001920.000|TR0|from a communication standpoint at this 
20110128001920.000|20110128001922.000|TR0|moment. Number one, you do have some 
20110128001922.000|20110128001924.000|TR0|frayed relations with the press inside 
20110128001924.000|20110128001926.000|TR0|that briefing room.  Number two, you have 
20110128001926.000|20110128001929.000|TR0|a Republican divided government with the 
20110128001929.000|20110128001931.000|TR0|Republicans running the House.  And number 
20110128001931.000|20110128001933.000|TR0|three we're ramping up for reelection and 
20110128001933.000|20110128001935.000|TR0|there will be a guy who speaks for the 
20110128001935.000|20110128001938.000|TR0|campaign, but the day-to-day job of 
20110128001938.000|20110128001940.000|TR0|speaking for the president is the White 
20110128001940.000|20110128001942.000|TR0|House press secretary.
20110128001942.000|20110128001945.000|TR0|
20110128001945.000|20110128001947.000|TR0|AVLON:  Yes, look it is a huge job.  It is 
20110128001947.000|20110128001949.000|TR0|the face of the administration.  And 
20110128001949.000|20110128001951.000|TR0|historically it's been very well served by 
20110128001951.000|20110128001954.000|TR0|former reporters.  This was actually a 
20110128001954.000|20110128001956.000|TR0|standard operating procedure back under 
20110128001956.000|20110128001958.000|TR0|FDR and Truman and really through many 
20110128001958.000|20110128002000.000|TR0|successive administrations.  So there's 
20110128002000.000|20110128002003.000|TR0|every sign that that is a good precedent 
20110128002003.000|20110128002005.000|TR0|to build on.
20110128002005.000|20110128002007.000|TR0|
20110128002007.000|20110128002010.000|TR0|Jay Carney's own statements on C-SPAN 
20110128002010.000|20110128002012.000|TR0|aside, I think he'll probably do just 
20110128002012.000|20110128002014.000|TR0|fine.  But the other piece is the mark of 
20110128002014.000|20110128002016.000|TR0|Bill Daley. And this really does echo to 
20110128002016.000|20110128002019.000|TR0|me the steadying centrist influence that 
20110128002019.000|20110128002021.000|TR0|Leon Panetta had in the Clinton 
20110128002021.000|20110128002023.000|TR0|administration after the 1994 Republican 
20110128002023.000|20110128002026.000|TR0|revolution.  Daley is professionalizing 
20110128002026.000|20110128002028.000|TR0|the White House. He is strengthening the 
20110128002028.000|20110128002030.000|TR0|president's stake (ph) to the center and 
20110128002030.000|20110128002032.000|TR0|with those actions you're going to see 
20110128002032.000|20110128002035.000|TR0|continued connection to the Independent 
20110128002035.000|20110128002037.000|TR0|voters who have been swinging so 
20110128002037.000|20110128002039.000|TR0|decisively towards the administration and 
20110128002039.000|20110128002041.000|TR0|the president since the election.
20110128002041.000|20110128002044.000|TR0|
20110128002044.000|20110128002046.000|TR0|KING:  And John Brabender, how hard is it 
20110128002046.000|20110128002048.000|TR0|to go from being on our side, my side, to 
20110128002048.000|20110128002051.000|TR0|being a communicator.  You're in the 
20110128002051.000|20110128002053.000|TR0|communication -- you can help candidates 
20110128002053.000|20110128002055.000|TR0|communicate.  As you answer, I just want 
20110128002055.000|20110128002057.000|TR0|to show -- show our viewers at home -- I 
20110128002057.000|20110128002100.000|TR0|know a lot about Jay Carney back in the 
20110128002100.000|20110128002102.000|TR0|old days.  That's Jay Carney right there 
20110128002102.000|20110128002104.000|TR0|and if they pull out a little bit you'll 
20110128002104.000|20110128002106.000|TR0|see the guy sitting next to him.  He used 
20110128002106.000|20110128002109.000|TR0|to cover the White House.  I don't know if 
20110128002109.000|20110128002111.000|TR0|we can see the pictures there.  Some guy 
20110128002111.000|20110128002113.000|TR0|named John King who was a senior --
20110128002113.000|20110128002116.000|TR0|
20110128002116.000|20110128002118.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)

20110128002120.000|20110128002122.000|TR0|KING:  Look at that.  Look at that, look 
20110128002122.000|20110128002125.000|TR0|at less gray hair -- that's an amazing 
20110128002125.000|20110128002127.000|TR0|thing.
20110128002127.000|20110128002129.000|TR0|
20110128002129.000|20110128002131.000|TR0|BRABENDER:  Most of the time when they try 
20110128002131.000|20110128002134.000|TR0|to make that transition they fail quite 
20110128002134.000|20110128002136.000|TR0|frankly.
20110128002136.000|20110128002138.000|TR0|
20110128002138.000|20110128002141.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.
20110128002141.000|20110128002143.000|TR0|
20110128002143.000|20110128002145.000|TR0|BRABENDER:  The difference is he got to 
20110128002145.000|20110128002147.000|TR0|spend about two years with Biden, so we 
20110128002147.000|20110128002150.000|TR0|know he's good at crisis management at 
20110128002150.000|20110128002152.000|TR0|that point (INAUDIBLE).
20110128002152.000|20110128002154.000|TR0|

20110128002159.000|20110128002201.000|TR0|BRABENDER:  I also think actually the 
20110128002201.000|20110128002203.000|TR0|administration very purposely decided they 
20110128002203.000|20110128002206.000|TR0|did not want anybody with any type of 
20110128002206.000|20110128002208.000|TR0|campaign background because I think 
20110128002208.000|20110128002210.000|TR0|they're afraid that was going to look like 
20110128002210.000|20110128002212.000|TR0|they're running --
20110128002212.000|20110128002215.000|TR0|

20110128002219.000|20110128002222.000|TR0|BORGER:  I think it's a very difficult 
20110128002222.000|20110128002224.000|TR0|transition to go from being a member of 
20110128002224.000|20110128002226.000|TR0|the press to go from being -- to a press 
20110128002226.000|20110128002228.000|TR0|secretary because we in the press want to 
20110128002228.000|20110128002231.000|TR0|answer every question all the way fully 
20110128002231.000|20110128002233.000|TR0|because those are the kinds of answers we 
20110128002233.000|20110128002235.000|TR0|want.  Then when you get to the other 
20110128002235.000|20110128002237.000|TR0|side, you realize, wait a minute, there 
20110128002237.000|20110128002240.000|TR0|are things I can't say.  And I think that 
20110128002240.000|20110128002242.000|TR0|was something that Jay Carney had to kind 
20110128002242.000|20110128002244.000|TR0|of adjust to in his new role.  So when he 
20110128002244.000|20110128002247.000|TR0|stands at the podium and he's got to say 
20110128002247.000|20110128002249.000|TR0|to reporters, can't really go there, can't 
20110128002249.000|20110128002251.000|TR0|talk about that.  It's going to be tough.

20110128002253.000|20110128002256.000|TR0|KING:  It's a tough job.  We've got to 
20110128002256.000|20110128002258.000|TR0|take a quick break here. When we come 
20110128002258.000|20110128002300.000|TR0|back, the first meeting of the Senate Tea 
20110128002300.000|20110128002302.000|TR0|Party caucus -- what did they get done?

20110128002316.000|20110128002318.000|TR0|meeting.  Only four members mind you, 
20110128002318.000|20110128002321.000|TR0|proof most of the Republican establishment 
20110128002321.000|20110128002323.000|TR0|is still wary of the Tea Party label.  But 
20110128002323.000|20110128002325.000|TR0|also on hand were dozens of activists who 
20110128002325.000|20110128002327.000|TR0|helped make the move in such a force in 
20110128002327.000|20110128002330.000|TR0|the 2010 midterms, and their Senate 
20110128002330.000|20110128002332.000|TR0|favorite South Carolina's Jim DeMint 
20110128002332.000|20110128002334.000|TR0|promised they would not be ignored now 
20110128002334.000|20110128002337.000|TR0|that campaigning gives way to governing.

20110128002343.000|20110128002346.000|TR0|SEN. JIM DEMINT (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  The 
20110128002346.000|20110128002348.000|TR0|seats that we sit in every day in the 
20110128002348.000|20110128002350.000|TR0|Senate are not ours.  They're yours, and 
20110128002350.000|20110128002352.000|TR0|they're lent to us to speak for you here.  
20110128002352.000|20110128002355.000|TR0|And we want to make sure that as we try to 
20110128002355.000|20110128002357.000|TR0|represent the Constitution, our oath of 
20110128002357.000|20110128002359.000|TR0|office, and you, that we listen to you.

20110128002406.000|20110128002408.000|TR0|KING:  Senior congressional correspondent 
20110128002408.000|20110128002411.000|TR0|Dana Bash was at this unusual meeting.  
20110128002411.000|20110128002413.000|TR0|And Dana, what is it they hope to 
20110128002413.000|20110128002415.000|TR0|accomplish?
20110128002415.000|20110128002417.000|TR0|
20110128002417.000|20110128002420.000|TR0|DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL 
20110128002420.000|20110128002422.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well you know this is -- 
20110128002422.000|20110128002424.000|TR0|first of all, you say unusual.  This is 
20110128002424.000|20110128002427.000|TR0|really, John, like nothing I remember 
20110128002427.000|20110128002429.000|TR0|seeing inside the halls of Congress.  
20110128002429.000|20110128002431.000|TR0|Inside being the operative word because 
20110128002431.000|20110128002433.000|TR0|many of the 150 activists who were here 
20110128002433.000|20110128002436.000|TR0|told me that they're used to being on the 
20110128002436.000|20110128002438.000|TR0|outside, rallying from the outside against 
20110128002438.000|20110128002440.000|TR0|what was going on here.
20110128002440.000|20110128002443.000|TR0|
20110128002443.000|20110128002445.000|TR0|But that really speaks to the answer to 
20110128002445.000|20110128002447.000|TR0|your question, what they're hoping to 
20110128002447.000|20110128002449.000|TR0|accomplish that they being the three 
20110128002449.000|20110128002452.000|TR0|members of the Senate who are part of this 
20110128002452.000|20110128002454.000|TR0|Tea Party caucus who invited them. 
20110128002454.000|20110128002456.000|TR0|Basically is to make clear to these 
20110128002456.000|20110128002458.000|TR0|activists who elected them that they are 
20110128002458.000|20110128002501.000|TR0|trying to get done what they promised.  
20110128002501.000|20110128002503.000|TR0|Things like lowering -- cutting spending, 
20110128002503.000|20110128002505.000|TR0|lowering the deficit, and shrinking the 
20110128002505.000|20110128002508.000|TR0|size of government, and really trying to 
20110128002508.000|20110128002510.000|TR0|keep them active for the next election and 
20110128002510.000|20110128002512.000|TR0|for legislative battles ahead.
20110128002512.000|20110128002514.000|TR0|
20110128002514.000|20110128002517.000|TR0|Certainly it was a festive atmosphere, 
20110128002517.000|20110128002519.000|TR0|John, but make no bones about it this was 
20110128002519.000|20110128002521.000|TR0|business for the Tea Party activists.  
20110128002521.000|20110128002523.000|TR0|Many of them told me that they want to 
20110128002523.000|20110128002526.000|TR0|hold these members accountable.  One 
20110128002526.000|20110128002528.000|TR0|actually said to me that if they don't 
20110128002528.000|20110128002530.000|TR0|follow through on their promises they're 
20110128002530.000|20110128002533.000|TR0|gone and we'll bring somebody else in.
20110128002533.000|20110128002535.000|TR0|
20110128002535.000|20110128002537.000|TR0|KING:  Well, they get six years on the 
20110128002537.000|20110128002539.000|TR0|Senate side, so they've got a while to 
20110128002539.000|20110128002542.000|TR0|keep their promises.  There are at least 
20110128002542.000|20110128002544.000|TR0|two people who rode to Washington at least 
20110128002544.000|20110128002546.000|TR0|in part with the Tea Party label -- Marco 
20110128002546.000|20110128002548.000|TR0|Rubio in Florida and Ron Johnson in 
20110128002548.000|20110128002551.000|TR0|Wisconsin -- who decided not to sign up at 
20110128002551.000|20110128002553.000|TR0|least at this initial meeting.  What's the 
20110128002553.000|20110128002555.000|TR0|back story there?
20110128002555.000|20110128002558.000|TR0|
20110128002558.000|20110128002600.000|TR0|BASH:  Really, really interesting.  Those 
20110128002600.000|20110128002602.000|TR0|two senators in particular, Marco Rubio, 
20110128002602.000|20110128002604.000|TR0|who of course really was a Tea Party 
20110128002604.000|20110128002607.000|TR0|darling in the last election, he says he's 
20110128002607.000|20110128002609.000|TR0|not really sure, but he definitely is not 
20110128002609.000|20110128002611.000|TR0|a member of the Tea Party caucus yet.  And 
20110128002611.000|20110128002613.000|TR0|he said the primary reason is because he 
20110128002613.000|20110128002616.000|TR0|is worried that all of a sudden it becomes 
20110128002616.000|20110128002618.000|TR0|a movement run by politicians and that 
20110128002618.000|20110128002620.000|TR0|it's going to lose its effectiveness.  And 
20110128002620.000|20110128002623.000|TR0|so that's his reason.
20110128002623.000|20110128002625.000|TR0|
20110128002625.000|20110128002627.000|TR0|Other people give other reasons.  There 
20110128002627.000|20110128002629.000|TR0|are a lot of senators who -- on the 
20110128002629.000|20110128002632.000|TR0|Republican side who are concerned that 
20110128002632.000|20110128002634.000|TR0|this will fracture the Republican caucus 
20110128002634.000|20110128002636.000|TR0|even further.  Jim DeMint I talked to him 
20110128002636.000|20110128002638.000|TR0|about this -- he insisted this is nothing 
20110128002638.000|20110128002641.000|TR0|of the sort.  This is a forum to keep the 
20110128002641.000|20110128002643.000|TR0|dialogue going and he says he's going to 
20110128002643.000|20110128002645.000|TR0|have more.
20110128002645.000|20110128002648.000|TR0|
20110128002648.000|20110128002650.000|TR0|KING:  All right, I think Senator Rubio's 
20110128002650.000|20110128002652.000|TR0|explanation sounds like political spin.  
20110128002652.000|20110128002654.000|TR0|Good to know he's getting quickly into the 
20110128002654.000|20110128002657.000|TR0|game here in Washington.  Dana Bash, thank 
20110128002657.000|20110128002659.000|TR0|you very much.  We'll keep an eye on that 
20110128002659.000|20110128002701.000|TR0|one.
20110128002701.000|20110128002704.000|TR0|
20110128002704.000|20110128002706.000|TR0|And let's go quickly around the group here 
20110128002706.000|20110128002708.000|TR0|-- John Avlon let me start with you -- you 
20110128002708.000|20110128002710.000|TR0|are not in the room -- significant, 
20110128002710.000|20110128002713.000|TR0|important, just another meeting?
20110128002713.000|20110128002715.000|TR0|
20110128002715.000|20110128002717.000|TR0|AVLON:  Look, I think it's significant 
20110128002717.000|20110128002719.000|TR0|they opened the doors up but it's good 
20110128002719.000|20110128002722.000|TR0|they opened up the doors up.  But now the 
20110128002722.000|20110128002724.000|TR0|Tea Party has to professionalize, it has 
20110128002724.000|20110128002726.000|TR0|to govern, it has to follow through, and 
20110128002726.000|20110128002729.000|TR0|that's going to be the real challenge.  If 
20110128002729.000|20110128002731.000|TR0|it can hold folks feet to the fire and 
20110128002731.000|20110128002733.000|TR0|represent activists and bring down the 
20110128002733.000|20110128002735.000|TR0|deficit and the debt, they will be very 
20110128002735.000|20110128002738.000|TR0|effective at driving the agenda.  If they 
20110128002738.000|20110128002740.000|TR0|get hijacked by activists and driven 
20110128002740.000|20110128002742.000|TR0|further right solely on social issues, 
20110128002742.000|20110128002744.000|TR0|that will end up being a problem, I think, 
20110128002744.000|20110128002747.000|TR0|in the long run into 2012 and further.
20110128002747.000|20110128002749.000|TR0|
20110128002749.000|20110128002751.000|TR0|KING:  And to that point John Brabender, 
20110128002751.000|20110128002754.000|TR0|can they accept compromise?  Governing is 
20110128002754.000|20110128002756.000|TR0|hard.  You have a Democratic president and 
20110128002756.000|20110128002758.000|TR0|a narrowly Democratic Senate.  You're not 
20110128002758.000|20110128002800.000|TR0|going to get Rand Paul's $500 billion in 
20110128002800.000|20110128002803.000|TR0|cuts.  You're not going to get everything 
20110128002803.000|20110128002805.000|TR0|the Tea Party wants.
20110128002805.000|20110128002807.000|TR0|
20110128002807.000|20110128002809.000|TR0|BRABENDER:  Yes, the Tea Party is doing 
20110128002809.000|20110128002812.000|TR0|pretty good so far.  I don't think the Tea 
20110128002812.000|20110128002814.000|TR0|Party itself actually wants compromise.  
20110128002814.000|20110128002816.000|TR0|But you got to remember this.  Right after 
20110128002816.000|20110128002819.000|TR0|the election, Mitch McConnell does a major 
20110128002819.000|20110128002821.000|TR0|switch, comes out against earmarks.  The 
20110128002821.000|20110128002823.000|TR0|president the other night comes out 
20110128002823.000|20110128002825.000|TR0|against earmarks.  In fact none other than 
20110128002825.000|20110128002828.000|TR0|Harry Reid gave him a dressing down today 
20110128002828.000|20110128002830.000|TR0|on that.  The power of the Tea Party is 
20110128002830.000|20110128002832.000|TR0|not the people within the Senate.  It's 
20110128002832.000|20110128002834.000|TR0|the people outside the Senate that's going 
20110128002834.000|20110128002837.000|TR0|--
20110128002837.000|20110128002839.000|TR0|
20110128002839.000|20110128002841.000|TR0|KING:  I want to turn the discussion to 
20110128002841.000|20110128002844.000|TR0|somebody who is a favorite of the Tea 
20110128002844.000|20110128002846.000|TR0|Party, the former Alaska Governor Sarah 
20110128002846.000|20110128002848.000|TR0|Palin. She gave her reaction to the 
20110128002848.000|20110128002850.000|TR0|president's State of the Union Address 
20110128002850.000|20110128002853.000|TR0|last night on FOX News.  And one of her 
20110128002853.000|20110128002855.000|TR0|challenges, if you look at the polling, if 
20110128002855.000|20110128002857.000|TR0|you talk to people, the question is, is 
20110128002857.000|20110128002900.000|TR0|she serious?

20110128002902.000|20110128002904.000|TR0|Meaning, is she up to the major policy 
20110128002904.000|20110128002906.000|TR0|questions of being the president?  So many 
20110128002906.000|20110128002909.000|TR0|have said will she try to talk more about 
20110128002909.000|20110128002911.000|TR0|policy? Will she try to improve her 
20110128002911.000|20110128002913.000|TR0|gravitas?  I want you to listen to this 
20110128002913.000|20110128002915.000|TR0|response to the State of the Union and 
20110128002915.000|20110128002918.000|TR0|tell me if you think it's -- is it cute, 
20110128002918.000|20110128002920.000|TR0|is it funny, or is it out of bounds?

20110128002929.000|20110128002931.000|TR0|ALASKA:  His theme last night in the State 
20110128002931.000|20110128002934.000|TR0|of the Union was the WTF, you know, 
20110128002934.000|20110128002936.000|TR0|winning the future.  And I thought OK, 
20110128002936.000|20110128002938.000|TR0|that acronym, spot on.  There were a lot 
20110128002938.000|20110128002940.000|TR0|of WTF moments throughout that speech.  
20110128002940.000|20110128002943.000|TR0|Namely, when he made the statement, Greta, 
20110128002943.000|20110128002945.000|TR0|that he believed that we can't allow 
20110128002945.000|20110128002947.000|TR0|ourselves to, I guess, eventually become 
20110128002947.000|20110128002950.000|TR0|buried under a mountain of debt.  That 
20110128002950.000|20110128002952.000|TR0|right there tells you he is so 
20110128002952.000|20110128002954.000|TR0|disconnected from reality.

20110128003005.000|20110128003008.000|TR0|unorthodox.

20110128003021.000|20110128003024.000|TR0|BORGER:  Right and this is the reason a 
20110128003024.000|20110128003026.000|TR0|lot of Republicans at a certain point are 
20110128003026.000|20110128003028.000|TR0|just going to avert their eyes and say, 
20110128003028.000|20110128003030.000|TR0|you know what, we're exhausted by her.  
20110128003030.000|20110128003033.000|TR0|She's not doing the party any good and at 
20110128003033.000|20110128003035.000|TR0|some point they're going to have to move 
20110128003035.000|20110128003037.000|TR0|on and look for somebody else to speak for 
20110128003037.000|20110128003040.000|TR0|them because of moments like that, which 
20110128003040.000|20110128003042.000|TR0|are really, you know, she's talking about 
20110128003042.000|20110128003044.000|TR0|the president of the United States. She's 
20110128003044.000|20110128003046.000|TR0|talking about a State of the Union speech. 
20110128003046.000|20110128003049.000|TR0| She's talking about the future of the 
20110128003049.000|20110128003051.000|TR0|country.  And it's really not a cute joke 
20110128003051.000|20110128003053.000|TR0|or a tweet.       KING:  That's what we 
20110128003053.000|20110128003055.000|TR0|think in official Washington and we can be 
20110128003055.000|20110128003058.000|TR0|a little stuffy sometimes.  Donna, could 
20110128003058.000|20110128003100.000|TR0|we be reading this wrong? Her appeal is 
20110128003100.000|20110128003102.000|TR0|she runs against the elites.  This one to 
20110128003102.000|20110128003105.000|TR0|me just seemed a little out there even for 
20110128003105.000|20110128003107.000|TR0|her.
20110128003107.000|20110128003109.000|TR0|
20110128003109.000|20110128003111.000|TR0|BRAZILE:  I think the American people are 
20110128003111.000|20110128003114.000|TR0|looking for both political parties to come 
20110128003114.000|20110128003116.000|TR0|to the table to solve our big crisis. 
20110128003116.000|20110128003118.000|TR0|That's what most people applauded in the 
20110128003118.000|20110128003121.000|TR0|president's speech.  They didn't go cherry 
20110128003121.000|20110128003123.000|TR0|picking looking for things to say that 
20110128003123.000|20110128003125.000|TR0|sound cute on talk radio.  That was not a 
20110128003125.000|20110128003127.000|TR0|presidential moment for Ms. Palin.
20110128003127.000|20110128003130.000|TR0|
20110128003130.000|20110128003132.000|TR0|KING:  You're the Republican strategist in 
20110128003132.000|20110128003134.000|TR0|the room.  Is that presidential?  If she 
20110128003134.000|20110128003136.000|TR0|wants to be presidential, it's interesting 
20110128003136.000|20110128003139.000|TR0|television.  It's provocative.  Is it 
20110128003139.000|20110128003141.000|TR0|presidential?
20110128003141.000|20110128003143.000|TR0|
20110128003143.000|20110128003146.000|TR0|BRABENDER:  I wouldn't advise it.  It's 
20110128003146.000|20110128003148.000|TR0|the type of thing though that I see all 
20110128003148.000|20110128003150.000|TR0|the time where you're having pizza, 
20110128003150.000|20110128003152.000|TR0|watching the State of the Union, and 
20110128003152.000|20110128003155.000|TR0|someone throws that out, and it sounds 
20110128003155.000|20110128003157.000|TR0|hilarious. I'm going to use that and then 
20110128003157.000|20110128003159.000|TR0|when you do use it, you think better of 
20110128003159.000|20110128003201.000|TR0|it.  I would guess she probably thinks 
20110128003201.000|20110128003204.000|TR0|better of it and I think it was slightly 
20110128003204.000|20110128003206.000|TR0|inappropriate.
20110128003206.000|20110128003208.000|TR0|
20110128003208.000|20110128003211.000|TR0|KING:  But John, do we trust our analysis 
20110128003211.000|20110128003213.000|TR0|of this?  By the conventional rule 
20110128003213.000|20110128003215.000|TR0|somebody who thinks of themselves as a 
20110128003215.000|20110128003217.000|TR0|future president, WTF, winning the future 
20110128003217.000|20110128003220.000|TR0|-- I get the joke.  It would be fine maybe 
20110128003220.000|20110128003222.000|TR0|for one of us to do.  I don't think 
20110128003222.000|20110128003224.000|TR0|anybody in this conversation is going to 
20110128003224.000|20110128003226.000|TR0|-- about to run for president.  For 
20110128003226.000|20110128003229.000|TR0|someone who is thinking about running for 
20110128003229.000|20110128003231.000|TR0|president and who the knock (ph) is that 
20110128003231.000|20110128003233.000|TR0|she's not serious.
20110128003233.000|20110128003236.000|TR0|
20110128003236.000|20110128003238.000|TR0|AVLON:  No, it compounds that problem, of 
20110128003238.000|20110128003240.000|TR0|course.  And look, the reality is that 
20110128003240.000|20110128003242.000|TR0|Sarah Palin is a genius at getting media 
20110128003242.000|20110128003245.000|TR0|attention. She sucks up the oxygen.  We 
20110128003245.000|20110128003247.000|TR0|all talk about her.  And her hardcore 
20110128003247.000|20110128003249.000|TR0|supporters love her more for moments like 
20110128003249.000|20110128003251.000|TR0|this.  But what's growing increasingly 
20110128003251.000|20110128003254.000|TR0|apparent, even within the Republican Party 
20110128003254.000|20110128003256.000|TR0|is a sense that she is not serious about 
20110128003256.000|20110128003258.000|TR0|running for president.  She is not serious 
20110128003258.000|20110128003301.000|TR0|about policy.  And therefore, she's not 
20110128003301.000|20110128003303.000|TR0|ready to be president. And that reality is 
20110128003303.000|20110128003305.000|TR0|going to sink in quicker than she realizes.
20110128003305.000|20110128003307.000|TR0|
20110128003307.000|20110128003310.000|TR0|BORGER:  You know of all people, Newt 
20110128003310.000|20110128003312.000|TR0|Gingrich who once compared himself to 
20110128003312.000|20110128003314.000|TR0|Napoleon last week said that she needs to 
20110128003314.000|20110128003316.000|TR0|be careful about what she says and I think 
20110128003316.000|20110128003319.000|TR0|slowly but surely you're seeing Republican 
20110128003319.000|20110128003321.000|TR0|conservatives come out and start sort of 
20110128003321.000|20110128003323.000|TR0|scratching away at the veneer of Sarah 
20110128003323.000|20110128003326.000|TR0|Palin.  But they're all afraid.

20110128003454.000|20110128003457.000|TR0|view is they made a clear decision, as did 
20110128003457.000|20110128003459.000|TR0|the Circuit Court was clear, as was the 
20110128003459.000|20110128003501.000|TR0|unanimous decision at the Board of 
20110128003501.000|20110128003503.000|TR0|Elections.  I think that this now means 
20110128003503.000|20110128003506.000|TR0|and what I hope it means is rather what 
20110128003506.000|20110128003508.000|TR0|7-0 means or interpreted is a clear 
20110128003508.000|20110128003510.000|TR0|decision that the voters will decide and 
20110128003510.000|20110128003512.000|TR0|we should focus on what the voters have 
20110128003512.000|20110128003515.000|TR0|asked us to focus on.  We're a pretty avid

20110128003542.000|20110128003544.000|TR0|JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, John.  
20110128003544.000|20110128003547.000|TR0|Tomorrow may be the biggest day yet for 
20110128003547.000|20110128003549.000|TR0|anti-government demonstrations in Egypt.  
20110128003549.000|20110128003551.000|TR0|Egypt's interior ministry says no protests 
20110128003551.000|20110128003553.000|TR0|will be permitted and reports say the 
20110128003553.000|20110128003556.000|TR0|Internet is already going dark in some 
20110128003556.000|20110128003558.000|TR0|Egyptian cities.

20110128003600.000|20110128003603.000|TR0|A new U.S. Army report says the military 
20110128003603.000|20110128003605.000|TR0|needs a new generation of light tactical 
20110128003605.000|20110128003607.000|TR0|vehicles to replace the humvee.  It 
20110128003607.000|20110128003609.000|TR0|predicts they'll cost at least $300,000 a 
20110128003609.000|20110128003612.000|TR0|piece, and that's before equipping them 
20110128003612.000|20110128003614.000|TR0|with the essential combat systems.  And 
20110128003614.000|20110128003616.000|TR0|good gosh, that's a lot of money there.  
20110128003616.000|20110128003618.000|TR0|But you know, in this environment, budget 
20110128003618.000|20110128003621.000|TR0|cutting environment, will the military 
20110128003621.000|20110128003623.000|TR0|still get what it says?

20110128003625.000|20110128003628.000|TR0|KING:  That is a huge question.  One of 
20110128003628.000|20110128003630.000|TR0|the guys who wants to cut a lot from the 
20110128003630.000|20110128003632.000|TR0|budget is Rand Paul, the new Republican 
20110128003632.000|20110128003634.000|TR0|senator from Kentucky.  He's a Tea Party 
20110128003634.000|20110128003637.000|TR0|favorite.  When we come back, a 
20110128003637.000|20110128003639.000|TR0|conversation with Rand Paul.  What should 
20110128003639.000|20110128003641.000|TR0|we cut and do the Republicans have a plan 
20110128003641.000|20110128003643.000|TR0|to create jobs?

20110128003650.000|20110128003653.000|TR0|KING:  The Senate Tea Party caucus held 
20110128003653.000|20110128003655.000|TR0|its first meeting today and so far it's a 
20110128003655.000|20110128003657.000|TR0|small group, just four members.  One of 
20110128003657.000|20110128003659.000|TR0|those members is the freshman senator from 
20110128003659.000|20110128003702.000|TR0|Kentucky, Rand Paul, who joked at today's 
20110128003702.000|20110128003704.000|TR0|meeting that he can already see the Tea 
20110128003704.000|20110128003706.000|TR0|Party's impact on Washington.

20110128003713.000|20110128003715.000|TR0|SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY:  I went to 
20110128003715.000|20110128003718.000|TR0|my first State of the Union the other day 
20110128003718.000|20110128003720.000|TR0|and guess who now is against earmarks?  
20110128003720.000|20110128003722.000|TR0|The president of the United States has 
20110128003722.000|20110128003724.000|TR0|been co-opted by the Tea Party.

20110128003731.000|20110128003733.000|TR0|KING:  Senator Paul joins us now from 
20110128003733.000|20110128003736.000|TR0|Capitol Hill.  Senator, let's start right 
20110128003736.000|20110128003738.000|TR0|there.  You know, the president did call 
20110128003738.000|20110128003740.000|TR0|for a ban on earmarks.  He did say he 
20110128003740.000|20110128003743.000|TR0|would veto any legislation that had them 
20110128003743.000|20110128003745.000|TR0|in it.  He has, as a senator he had some 
20110128003745.000|20110128003747.000|TR0|earmarks, but he has had an evolution on 
20110128003747.000|20110128003749.000|TR0|that issue.  Is that proof to you that, 
20110128003749.000|20110128003752.000|TR0|yes, there will be some big partisan 
20110128003752.000|20110128003754.000|TR0|fights, but on some things there can be 
20110128003754.000|20110128003756.000|TR0|adult, grown-up conversations and 
20110128003756.000|20110128003759.000|TR0|agreements?
20110128003759.000|20110128003801.000|TR0|
20110128003801.000|20110128003803.000|TR0|PAUL:  Yeah, to a certain extent.  I think 
20110128003803.000|20110128003805.000|TR0|the election is really resonating.  I 
20110128003805.000|20110128003808.000|TR0|think people in Washington did listen and 
20110128003808.000|20110128003810.000|TR0|watched the results of the election in 
20110128003810.000|20110128003812.000|TR0|November, and I think things will be 
20110128003812.000|20110128003814.000|TR0|different.  The other thing that makes it 
20110128003814.000|20110128003817.000|TR0|different though is not just the election, 
20110128003817.000|20110128003819.000|TR0|but it's the imminence of the debt 
20110128003819.000|20110128003821.000|TR0|problem.  We have to do something about 
20110128003821.000|20110128003824.000|TR0|tackling the debt crisis.
20110128003824.000|20110128003826.000|TR0|
20110128003826.000|20110128003828.000|TR0|KING:  And I want to get to some of your 
20110128003828.000|20110128003830.000|TR0|specific proposals to do that, but first I 
20110128003830.000|20110128003833.000|TR0|want to talk about this Tea Party caucus.  
20110128003833.000|20110128003835.000|TR0|There were other senators, freshman 
20110128003835.000|20110128003837.000|TR0|Republican senators who ran with the Tea 
20110128003837.000|20110128003839.000|TR0|Party label who were not with you today.  
20110128003839.000|20110128003842.000|TR0|Marco Rubio has drawn a lot of attention 
20110128003842.000|20110128003844.000|TR0|for being somewhat uneasy about joining 
20110128003844.000|20110128003846.000|TR0|the Tea Party caucus.  Does it matter to 
20110128003846.000|20110128003849.000|TR0|you? Do you think they should join? Is 
20110128003849.000|20110128003851.000|TR0|there some reason not to?
20110128003851.000|20110128003853.000|TR0|
20110128003853.000|20110128003855.000|TR0|PAUL:  Well I think the interesting thing 
20110128003855.000|20110128003858.000|TR0|is that not everybody knows what the Tea 
20110128003858.000|20110128003900.000|TR0|Party caucus is going to be until it 
20110128003900.000|20110128003902.000|TR0|happens.  So today what we tried to show 
20110128003902.000|20110128003904.000|TR0|other members, as well as the country is 
20110128003904.000|20110128003907.000|TR0|this isn't a bunch of guys with cigars in 
20110128003907.000|20110128003909.000|TR0|a dark room deciding what the Tea Party 
20110128003909.000|20110128003911.000|TR0|caucus will be or what our agenda will be. 
20110128003911.000|20110128003914.000|TR0| We invited the grassroots leaders.  We 
20110128003914.000|20110128003916.000|TR0|had six or eight grassroots leaders who 
20110128003916.000|20110128003918.000|TR0|sat in the front of the room with the 
20110128003918.000|20110128003920.000|TR0|senators.  We also invited grassroots 
20110128003920.000|20110128003923.000|TR0|activists from around D.C., Pennsylvania, 
20110128003923.000|20110128003925.000|TR0|West Virginia, Virginia and New York, 
20110128003925.000|20110128003927.000|TR0|Delaware, who came down, and this is about 
20110128003927.000|20110128003929.000|TR0|a dialogue.  The grassroots Tea Party 
20110128003929.000|20110128003932.000|TR0|movement, I've always said, is open mike.  
20110128003932.000|20110128003934.000|TR0|It's like they want to address their 
20110128003934.000|20110128003936.000|TR0|grievances.  Now they have some 
20110128003936.000|20110128003939.000|TR0|representatives that can help them.  But 
20110128003939.000|20110128003941.000|TR0|it's still about a dialogue between the 
20110128003941.000|20110128003943.000|TR0|Tea Party and between the legislature.
20110128003943.000|20110128003945.000|TR0|
20110128003945.000|20110128003948.000|TR0|KING:  And yet there are some, I don't 
20110128003948.000|20110128003950.000|TR0|know if suspicions is the right word, but 
20110128003950.000|20110128003952.000|TR0|there is some sense of unease among the 
20110128003952.000|20110128003954.000|TR0|establishment with what you're trying to 
20110128003954.000|20110128003957.000|TR0|do.  People view it as perhaps a rival 
20110128003957.000|20110128003959.000|TR0|effort or somehow a competitive effort.  
20110128003959.000|20110128004001.000|TR0|Have you had any success in sort of easing 
20110128004001.000|20110128004004.000|TR0|that?  Your own senior senator, Mitch 
20110128004004.000|20110128004006.000|TR0|McConnell, doesn't love this idea.
20110128004006.000|20110128004008.000|TR0|
20110128004008.000|20110128004010.000|TR0|PAUL:  I think what you'll find is when 
20110128004010.000|20110128004013.000|TR0|they see what we're talking about, today 
20110128004013.000|20110128004015.000|TR0|we talked about a balanced budget 
20110128004015.000|20110128004017.000|TR0|amendment to the Constitution.  The vast 
20110128004017.000|20110128004020.000|TR0|majority of the Republican caucus agrees 
20110128004020.000|20110128004022.000|TR0|with that idea.  In fact, it may be 
20110128004022.000|20110128004024.000|TR0|universal.
20110128004024.000|20110128004026.000|TR0|
20110128004026.000|20110128004029.000|TR0|We're already talking about that here in 
20110128004029.000|20110128004031.000|TR0|Washington.  The Republican senators are 
20110128004031.000|20110128004033.000|TR0|talking about a balanced budget amendment. 
20110128004033.000|20110128004035.000|TR0| I think they are on the House side, too.  
20110128004035.000|20110128004038.000|TR0|So the things the Tea Party is talking 
20110128004038.000|20110128004040.000|TR0|about, I've always said, are not extreme.  
20110128004040.000|20110128004042.000|TR0|What's extreme is the $2 trillion debt.  
20110128004042.000|20110128004045.000|TR0|What we're talking about is very 
20110128004045.000|20110128004047.000|TR0|reasonable and very rational.  That's how 
20110128004047.000|20110128004049.000|TR0|do we balance our budget?
20110128004049.000|20110128004051.000|TR0|
20110128004051.000|20110128004054.000|TR0|KING:  You've had the courage to put 
20110128004054.000|20110128004056.000|TR0|forward, I say the courage because you lay 
20110128004056.000|20110128004058.000|TR0|out specifics, $500 billion in cuts.  As 
20110128004058.000|20110128004100.000|TR0|you know, many of them are quite 
20110128004100.000|20110128004103.000|TR0|controversial, not just with the 
20110128004103.000|20110128004105.000|TR0|Democrats, but with members of your own 
20110128004105.000|20110128004107.000|TR0|party.  So I want to go through some of 
20110128004107.000|20110128004110.000|TR0|them. Eliminating the Government Printing 
20110128004110.000|20110128004112.000|TR0|Office, some people say with technology 
20110128004112.000|20110128004114.000|TR0|you could do that.  But some would debate 
20110128004114.000|20110128004116.000|TR0|it.  But you call for eliminating the 
20110128004116.000|20110128004119.000|TR0|Department of Energy, eliminating the 
20110128004119.000|20110128004121.000|TR0|Department of Housing and Urban 
20110128004121.000|20110128004123.000|TR0|Development, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, 
20110128004123.000|20110128004125.000|TR0|Amtrak Subsidies, International 
20110128004125.000|20110128004128.000|TR0|Assistance, Consumer Product Safety 
20110128004128.000|20110128004130.000|TR0|Commissions, all arts funding, some 
20110128004130.000|20110128004132.000|TR0|affordable housing programs.  I'm 
20110128004132.000|20110128004135.000|TR0|assuming, let's leave the Democrats out of 
20110128004135.000|20110128004137.000|TR0|this, that in your own Republican 
20110128004137.000|20110128004139.000|TR0|conference, most of that is a very tough 
20110128004139.000|20110128004141.000|TR0|sell.
20110128004141.000|20110128004144.000|TR0|
20110128004144.000|20110128004146.000|TR0|PAUL:  Well, here's what I would say.  We 
20110128004146.000|20110128004148.000|TR0|have outlined the most bold initiative in 
20110128004148.000|20110128004150.000|TR0|Washington probably ever for cutting 
20110128004150.000|20110128004153.000|TR0|spending, $500 billion.  But you know 
20110128004153.000|20110128004155.000|TR0|what, if I had my way and we passed it, it 
20110128004155.000|20110128004157.000|TR0|would only fix one-third of the annual 
20110128004157.000|20110128004200.000|TR0|deficit's problem.  The deficit this year 
20110128004200.000|20110128004202.000|TR0|will be $1.5 trillion.  To those who would 
20110128004202.000|20110128004204.000|TR0|argue that this is too draconian and we 
20110128004204.000|20110128004206.000|TR0|cannot do this, I say to them, what 
20110128004206.000|20110128004209.000|TR0|happens if we do nothing?
20110128004209.000|20110128004211.000|TR0|
20110128004211.000|20110128004213.000|TR0|If we do nothing, entitlements in interest 
20110128004213.000|20110128004216.000|TR0|will consume the entire budget within a 
20110128004216.000|20110128004218.000|TR0|decade and there will be no room for any 
20110128004218.000|20110128004220.000|TR0|other spending.  So I say let's get 
20110128004220.000|20110128004222.000|TR0|started now.  My proposal may not pass, 
20110128004222.000|20110128004225.000|TR0|but let's start there, find things that 
20110128004225.000|20110128004227.000|TR0|are acceptable, not acceptable.  But you 
20110128004227.000|20110128004229.000|TR0|can't not do anything.  If we do nothing, 
20110128004229.000|20110128004231.000|TR0|I think our economy will drown under the 
20110128004231.000|20110128004234.000|TR0|weight of our debt.
20110128004234.000|20110128004236.000|TR0|
20110128004236.000|20110128004238.000|TR0|KING:  And what do you say to somebody out 
20110128004238.000|20110128004241.000|TR0|there who maybe is taking advantage of 
20110128004241.000|20110128004243.000|TR0|that affordable housing program, who is 
20110128004243.000|20110128004245.000|TR0|unemployed at the moment, who is getting 
20110128004245.000|20110128004247.000|TR0|the assistance for the first time in their 
20110128004247.000|20110128004250.000|TR0|life and wants nothing more to get off it, 
20110128004250.000|20110128004252.000|TR0|but needs it today?
20110128004252.000|20110128004254.000|TR0|
20110128004254.000|20110128004256.000|TR0|PAUL:  I think there can be some 
20110128004256.000|20110128004259.000|TR0|transitions to everything and there can be 
20110128004259.000|20110128004301.000|TR0|means testing to a lot of programs.  You 
20110128004301.000|20110128004303.000|TR0|know for example, unemployment benefits, 
20110128004303.000|20110128004306.000|TR0|they do help some people and some people 
20110128004306.000|20110128004308.000|TR0|can't survive without them.  But if you 
20110128004308.000|20110128004310.000|TR0|make a million dollars a year last year 
20110128004310.000|20110128004312.000|TR0|and you're unemployed, do you think we 
20110128004312.000|20110128004315.000|TR0|could exclude millionaires from 
20110128004315.000|20110128004317.000|TR0|unemployment benefits?  So there are ways.
20110128004317.000|20110128004319.000|TR0|
20110128004319.000|20110128004321.000|TR0|But you've got to start the discussion.  
20110128004321.000|20110128004324.000|TR0|You have to emphasize the enormity of the 
20110128004324.000|20110128004326.000|TR0|problem.  Can we cut the $500 billion?  I 
20110128004326.000|20110128004328.000|TR0|don't know.  But that's a beginning.  
20110128004328.000|20110128004331.000|TR0|That's where we have to start.  We can't 
20110128004331.000|20110128004333.000|TR0|start with $50 billion and say, oh, raise 
20110128004333.000|20110128004335.000|TR0|the debt ceiling, here's $50 billion in 
20110128004335.000|20110128004337.000|TR0|cuts.  They'll be back six months later 
20110128004337.000|20110128004340.000|TR0|and they'll ask us to raise the debt 
20110128004340.000|20110128004342.000|TR0|ceiling again.  Things are seriously 
20110128004342.000|20110128004344.000|TR0|broken.  And the alternative is not the 
20110128004344.000|20110128004346.000|TR0|status quo.  The alternative is the status 
20110128004346.000|20110128004349.000|TR0|quo may bankrupt America.       KING:  
20110128004349.000|20110128004351.000|TR0|Answer to the chorus of criticism I'm sure 
20110128004351.000|20110128004353.000|TR0|you're hearing from Democrats who say the 
20110128004353.000|20110128004356.000|TR0|Republicans have been in the majority in 
20110128004356.000|20110128004358.000|TR0|the House and they have more Republicans 
20110128004358.000|20110128004400.000|TR0|in the Senate now.  We're three or four 
20110128004400.000|20110128004402.000|TR0|weeks into this new environment here in 
20110128004402.000|20110128004405.000|TR0|Washington and they're talking cutting 
20110128004405.000|20110128004407.000|TR0|spending, balanced budget amendments, 
20110128004407.000|20110128004409.000|TR0|deficits, debts, red ink, where is the 
20110128004409.000|20110128004411.000|TR0|Republicans jobs program?
20110128004411.000|20110128004414.000|TR0|
20110128004414.000|20110128004416.000|TR0|PAUL:  Well, I think jobs program is we 
20110128004416.000|20110128004418.000|TR0|want to shrink the government sector and 
20110128004418.000|20110128004421.000|TR0|we want to expand the private sector.  
20110128004421.000|20110128004423.000|TR0|Right now one out of four gross domestic 
20110128004423.000|20110128004425.000|TR0|product dollars is spent in Washington. It 
20110128004425.000|20110128004427.000|TR0|used to be one in five.  So we now have 25 
20110128004427.000|20110128004430.000|TR0|percent of our gross domestic product 
20110128004430.000|20110128004432.000|TR0|spent in Washington.  I want to shrink 
20110128004432.000|20110128004434.000|TR0|that back to the historic 20, 18, 19 
20110128004434.000|20110128004437.000|TR0|percent, but send that extra 5 percent 
20110128004437.000|20110128004439.000|TR0|back into the private sector where useful 
20110128004439.000|20110128004441.000|TR0|creative jobs that consumers want can be 
20110128004441.000|20110128004443.000|TR0|creative.  So I'm all for jobs and 
20110128004443.000|20110128004446.000|TR0|creating jobs.  But I think the private 
20110128004446.000|20110128004448.000|TR0|sector creates jobs, not government.
20110128004448.000|20110128004450.000|TR0|
20110128004450.000|20110128004452.000|TR0|KING:  And you're not worried about the 
20110128004452.000|20110128004455.000|TR0|political argument there. As you remember, 
20110128004455.000|20110128004457.000|TR0|you weren't in the Congress at the time, 
20110128004457.000|20110128004459.000|TR0|but Republicans were quite successful when 
20110128004459.000|20110128004502.000|TR0|President Obama had the health care bill, 
20110128004502.000|20110128004504.000|TR0|had some other initiatives first.  They 
20110128004504.000|20110128004506.000|TR0|said there was a tonal problem, that he 
20110128004506.000|20110128004508.000|TR0|was not focusing on the number one concern 
20110128004508.000|20110128004511.000|TR0|of Americans.  Do you worry the Democrats 
20110128004511.000|20110128004513.000|TR0|can successfully turn that on your party?
20110128004513.000|20110128004515.000|TR0|
20110128004515.000|20110128004517.000|TR0|PAUL:  Well the thing is, their programs I 
20110128004517.000|20110128004520.000|TR0|think are killing jobs.  The financial 
20110128004520.000|20110128004522.000|TR0|regulation bill is going to add 5,000 
20110128004522.000|20110128004524.000|TR0|regulations to community banks.  That's 
20110128004524.000|20110128004527.000|TR0|not where the banking problem is.  That's 
20110128004527.000|20110128004529.000|TR0|going to kill the local banks in each of 
20110128004529.000|20110128004531.000|TR0|our states.  Obamacare or the health care 
20110128004531.000|20110128004533.000|TR0|takeover is creating penalties for a lot 
20110128004533.000|20110128004536.000|TR0|of businesses who hire part-time workers.
20110128004536.000|20110128004538.000|TR0|
20110128004538.000|20110128004540.000|TR0|Where do you get a job if you're 
20110128004540.000|20110128004542.000|TR0|unemployed or lack education? You get a 
20110128004542.000|20110128004545.000|TR0|part time job or a temporary job.  Those 
20110128004545.000|20110128004547.000|TR0|jobs, a lot of times, don't have health 
20110128004547.000|20110128004549.000|TR0|insurance.  When you force them to buy 
20110128004549.000|20110128004552.000|TR0|health insurance or pay a penalty, you're 
20110128004552.000|20110128004554.000|TR0|going to have less jobs.  So Obamacare 
20110128004554.000|20110128004556.000|TR0|has, I think they were well intended, but 
20110128004556.000|20110128004558.000|TR0|they didn't look at the unintended 
20110128004558.000|20110128004601.000|TR0|consequences of government getting 
20110128004601.000|20110128004603.000|TR0|involved in one- sixth of our economy.
20110128004603.000|20110128004605.000|TR0|
20110128004605.000|20110128004607.000|TR0|KING:  Let me close with a personal family 
20110128004607.000|20110128004610.000|TR0|question.  On the first day of this 
20110128004610.000|20110128004612.000|TR0|Congress, I was with you up on that very 
20110128004612.000|20110128004614.000|TR0|balcony with your dad.  He of course is a 
20110128004614.000|20110128004617.000|TR0|House member, a conservative from Texas.  
20110128004617.000|20110128004619.000|TR0|You're a senator, Republican from 
20110128004619.000|20110128004621.000|TR0|Kentucky.  In the "Dallas Morning News" 
20110128004621.000|20110128004623.000|TR0|this morning, there's an article quoting 
20110128004623.000|20110128004626.000|TR0|your father, Ron Paul, saying he's 
20110128004626.000|20110128004628.000|TR0|thinking of running for the Senate seat 
20110128004628.000|20110128004630.000|TR0|that is on the ballot in Texas in 2012.  
20110128004630.000|20110128004632.000|TR0|Have you talked about that? Do you think 
20110128004632.000|20110128004635.000|TR0|that's likely?
20110128004635.000|20110128004637.000|TR0|
20110128004637.000|20110128004639.000|TR0|PAUL:  Well the thing about it is, we have 
20110128004639.000|20110128004642.000|TR0|talked about the House and the Senate.  
20110128004642.000|20110128004644.000|TR0|You know, if he comes over I would 
20110128004644.000|20110128004646.000|TR0|actually have seniority on him.  So then 
20110128004646.000|20110128004648.000|TR0|he would have listen more to my arguments. 
20110128004648.000|20110128004651.000|TR0|And so far, he has had some pretty strong 
20110128004651.000|20110128004653.000|TR0|opinions of his own.  So we'll see.  I 
20110128004653.000|20110128004655.000|TR0|don't know what his decision is, but I 
20110128004655.000|20110128004658.000|TR0|think he is thinking about it, but I don't 
20110128004658.000|20110128004700.000|TR0|know really what his thoughts and 
20110128004700.000|20110128004702.000|TR0|conclusions are.       KING:  Senator Rand 
20110128004702.000|20110128004704.000|TR0|Paul of Kentucky.  Sir, we appreciate your 
20110128004704.000|20110128004707.000|TR0|time today.
20110128004707.000|20110128004709.000|TR0|
20110128004709.000|20110128004711.000|TR0|PAUL:  Thank you.
20110128004711.000|20110128004713.000|TR0|
20110128004713.000|20110128004716.000|TR0|KING:  Up next, a competing voice, the 
20110128004716.000|20110128004718.000|TR0|head of the AFL-CIO is striking a rare 
20110128004718.000|20110128004720.000|TR0|alliance on one issue with the Chamber of 
20110128004720.000|20110128004723.000|TR0|Commerce. But he asks with all this talk 
20110128004723.000|20110128004725.000|TR0|of deficit reduction, where are the jobs?
20110128004725.000|20110128004727.000|TR0|
20110128004727.000|20110128004729.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110128004729.000|20110128004732.000|TR0|
20110128004732.000|20110128004734.000|TR0|KING:  In most big policy battles, take 
20110128004734.000|20110128004736.000|TR0|health care reform for example, organized 
20110128004736.000|20110128004738.000|TR0|labor and the Chamber of Commerce, well, 
20110128004738.000|20110128004741.000|TR0|they take competing sides.  So it caught 
20110128004741.000|20110128004743.000|TR0|our attention the other day when the 
20110128004743.000|20110128004745.000|TR0|Chamber and the AFL-CIO issued a joint 
20110128004745.000|20110128004748.000|TR0|statement praising President Obama's State 
20110128004748.000|20110128004750.000|TR0|of the Union call for new spending of 
20110128004750.000|20110128004752.000|TR0|roads, bridges and other infrastructure.  
20110128004752.000|20110128004754.000|TR0|Is this a one-time alliance or a sign of 
20110128004754.000|20110128004757.000|TR0|things to come?  And how worried is labor 
20110128004757.000|20110128004759.000|TR0|at the recent White House efforts to make 
20110128004759.000|20110128004801.000|TR0|peace with corporate America?
20110128004801.000|20110128004803.000|TR0|
20110128004803.000|20110128004806.000|TR0|Richard Trumka is the president of the 
20110128004806.000|20110128004808.000|TR0|AFL-CIO and is with us tonight from the 
20110128004808.000|20110128004810.000|TR0|World Economic Forum in Davos, 
20110128004810.000|20110128004813.000|TR0|Switzerland. President Trumka, good to see 
20110128004813.000|20110128004815.000|TR0|you, sir.
20110128004815.000|20110128004817.000|TR0|
20110128004817.000|20110128004819.000|TR0|Let's start with that statement.  Tom 
20110128004819.000|20110128004822.000|TR0|Donohue, the chairman of the Chamber of 
20110128004822.000|20110128004824.000|TR0|Commerce, Rich Trumka, the president of 
20110128004824.000|20110128004826.000|TR0|the AFL-CIO, saying America's working 
20110128004826.000|20110128004828.000|TR0|families and business communities stand 
20110128004828.000|20110128004831.000|TR0|united in applauding President Obama's 
20110128004831.000|20110128004833.000|TR0|call to create jobs and grow our economy 
20110128004833.000|20110128004835.000|TR0|through investment in our nation's 
20110128004835.000|20110128004838.000|TR0|infrastructure.  You know, sir, that most 
20110128004838.000|20110128004840.000|TR0|Republicans in the Congress said no.  
20110128004840.000|20110128004842.000|TR0|That's more spending.  We can't afford it 
20110128004842.000|20110128004844.000|TR0|right now.  Do you have a commitment from 
20110128004844.000|20110128004847.000|TR0|Tom Donohue that the Chamber will work 
20110128004847.000|20110128004849.000|TR0|with you to lobby Republicans to spend 
20110128004849.000|20110128004851.000|TR0|that money?
20110128004851.000|20110128004854.000|TR0|
20110128004854.000|20110128004856.000|TR0|RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO:  As 
20110128004856.000|20110128004858.000|TR0|you know, we have a $2.2 trillion 
20110128004858.000|20110128004900.000|TR0|infrastructure deficit for old 
20110128004900.000|20110128004903.000|TR0|infrastructure, and we have a $2 trillion 
20110128004903.000|20110128004905.000|TR0|infrastructure deficit to get us into the 
20110128004905.000|20110128004907.000|TR0|21st century. He and I both know that we 
20110128004907.000|20110128004909.000|TR0|have to do infrastructure investment one 
20110128004909.000|20110128004912.000|TR0|to create jobs and two, to make this 
20110128004912.000|20110128004914.000|TR0|country more competitive.  It's an 
20110128004914.000|20110128004916.000|TR0|absolute great policy and we're both on 
20110128004916.000|20110128004919.000|TR0|board with it and we'll both fight to make 
20110128004919.000|20110128004921.000|TR0|it happen.  Yes, he committed to do that.  
20110128004921.000|20110128004923.000|TR0|We talked about it the past.  And I would 
20110128004923.000|20110128004925.000|TR0|say that he understands and his word is 
20110128004925.000|20110128004928.000|TR0|his word.
20110128004928.000|20110128004930.000|TR0|
20110128004930.000|20110128004932.000|TR0|KING:  Give me your sense of the new 
20110128004932.000|20110128004934.000|TR0|political environment. We're talking to 
20110128004934.000|20110128004937.000|TR0|Rand Paul today and he has a proposal, 
20110128004937.000|20110128004939.000|TR0|unlikely to be passed.  But it's one of 
20110128004939.000|20110128004941.000|TR0|the Republican proposals on the table that 
20110128004941.000|20110128004944.000|TR0|would eliminate government agencies, which 
20110128004944.000|20110128004946.000|TR0|as a result, would eliminate government 
20110128004946.000|20110128004948.000|TR0|jobs.  We see this playing out at the 
20110128004948.000|20110128004950.000|TR0|state and city level where governors and 
20110128004950.000|20110128004953.000|TR0|majors simply don't have any money. Among 
20110128004953.000|20110128004955.000|TR0|your groups in the AFL-CIO are a lot of 
20110128004955.000|20110128004957.000|TR0|public sector employees. I assume you see 
20110128004957.000|20110128004959.000|TR0|very difficult times ahead at the federal, 
20110128004959.000|20110128005002.000|TR0|state and city level over the next year or 
20110128005002.000|20110128005004.000|TR0|so.
20110128005004.000|20110128005006.000|TR0|
20110128005006.000|20110128005009.000|TR0|TRUMKA:  Well, this is very difficult 
20110128005009.000|20110128005011.000|TR0|times for all workers.  We have 50 million 
20110128005011.000|20110128005013.000|TR0|people unemployed right now.  This isn't a 
20110128005013.000|20110128005015.000|TR0|time to be playing political games.  This 
20110128005015.000|20110128005018.000|TR0|is a time to be creating jobs.  We have a 
20110128005018.000|20110128005020.000|TR0|jobs crisis.  And if the last election 
20110128005020.000|20110128005022.000|TR0|said anything, it said create jobs or you 
20110128005022.000|20110128005024.000|TR0|face the wrath of the voter.  Now if they 
20110128005024.000|20110128005027.000|TR0|don't go back and create jobs, you'll the 
20110128005027.000|20110128005029.000|TR0|same turnaround in the next election.  We 
20110128005029.000|20110128005031.000|TR0|have a jobs crisis.  That's what they 
20110128005031.000|20110128005034.000|TR0|should be focused on.
20110128005034.000|20110128005036.000|TR0|
20110128005036.000|20110128005038.000|TR0|KING:  They say we have a deficit crisis.
20110128005038.000|20110128005040.000|TR0|
20110128005040.000|20110128005043.000|TR0|TRUMKA:  Well, you can't cut your way out 
20110128005043.000|20110128005045.000|TR0|of a deficit crisis. You have to grow your 
20110128005045.000|20110128005047.000|TR0|way out.  The only way to do that is to 
20110128005047.000|20110128005049.000|TR0|create jobs.  When you put people to work, 
20110128005049.000|20110128005052.000|TR0|they pay taxes and don't use government 
20110128005052.000|20110128005054.000|TR0|services.  They add, not detract from 
20110128005054.000|20110128005056.000|TR0|anything.  You cannot simply cut your way 
20110128005056.000|20110128005059.000|TR0|out of it.  Every economist will tell you 
20110128005059.000|20110128005101.000|TR0|that. The world economists will tell you 
20110128005101.000|20110128005103.000|TR0|that.
20110128005103.000|20110128005105.000|TR0|
20110128005105.000|20110128005108.000|TR0|KING:  You applaud the infrastructure 
20110128005108.000|20110128005110.000|TR0|commitment the president made, proposal he 
20110128005110.000|20110128005112.000|TR0|made in the State of the Union address.  
20110128005112.000|20110128005115.000|TR0|But are you seeing enough from the 
20110128005115.000|20110128005117.000|TR0|president of the United States?  
20110128005117.000|20110128005119.000|TR0|Traditionally, since he's a Democrat, an 
20110128005119.000|20110128005121.000|TR0|ally, are you seeing enough from him on 
20110128005121.000|20110128005124.000|TR0|the jobs front, or has he moved too much 
20110128005124.000|20110128005126.000|TR0|to the center in your view because of this 
20110128005126.000|20110128005128.000|TR0|new political reality?
20110128005128.000|20110128005130.000|TR0|
20110128005130.000|20110128005133.000|TR0|TRUMKA:  Well I think if you look back to 
20110128005133.000|20110128005135.000|TR0|the stimulus program, it was effective.  
20110128005135.000|20110128005137.000|TR0|But everybody at the time knew that it was 
20110128005137.000|20110128005140.000|TR0|too small to solve the problem.  He had to 
20110128005140.000|20110128005142.000|TR0|do that because the Republicans opposed 
20110128005142.000|20110128005144.000|TR0|everything that he was doing.  Right now 
20110128005144.000|20110128005146.000|TR0|our fear is that they won't come to solve 
20110128005146.000|20110128005149.000|TR0|the problem with the scale necessary to do 
20110128005149.000|20110128005151.000|TR0|so.  I think he probably boxed himself a 
20110128005151.000|20110128005153.000|TR0|little bit when he called for a five-year 
20110128005153.000|20110128005155.000|TR0|discretionary spending freeze.  So are you 
20110128005155.000|20110128005158.000|TR0|going to invest in jobs and make us the 
20110128005158.000|20110128005200.000|TR0|21st century power again if you can't do 
20110128005200.000|20110128005202.000|TR0|anything with the budget?
20110128005202.000|20110128005205.000|TR0|
20110128005205.000|20110128005207.000|TR0|KING:  Who you hire is a reflection of 
20110128005207.000|20110128005209.000|TR0|what you think.  When you look at the 
20110128005209.000|20110128005211.000|TR0|president's new chief of staff, who under 
20110128005211.000|20110128005214.000|TR0|President Clinton led the effort to pass 
20110128005214.000|20110128005216.000|TR0|NAFTA, if you look at the vice president's 
20110128005216.000|20110128005218.000|TR0|chief of staff, Bruce Reed, just came out 
20110128005218.000|20110128005220.000|TR0|of the Democratic Leadership Council, 
20110128005220.000|20110128005223.000|TR0|which spent a lot of time in the 1980s and 
20110128005223.000|20110128005225.000|TR0|1990s arguing the Democratic Party was too 
20110128005225.000|20110128005227.000|TR0|beholden to organized labor.  Do you see a 
20110128005227.000|20110128005230.000|TR0|personnel shift at the White House that 
20110128005230.000|20110128005232.000|TR0|signals to you, trouble?
20110128005232.000|20110128005234.000|TR0|
20110128005234.000|20110128005236.000|TR0|TRUMKA:  Here's what I know.  The 
20110128005236.000|20110128005239.000|TR0|president makes the decisions. It's going 
20110128005239.000|20110128005241.000|TR0|to ultimately be up to him.  We had a long 
20110128005241.000|20110128005243.000|TR0|relationship with Bill Daley.  We have a 
20110128005243.000|20110128005245.000|TR0|working relationship with everyone of the 
20110128005245.000|20110128005248.000|TR0|secretaries.  We have a working 
20110128005248.000|20110128005250.000|TR0|relationship with the administration. We 
20110128005250.000|20110128005252.000|TR0|think we're in pretty good shape.  We have 
20110128005252.000|20110128005255.000|TR0|an open dialogue.  We don't win every 
20110128005255.000|20110128005257.000|TR0|argument but we get our word in on every 
20110128005257.000|20110128005259.000|TR0|argument.
20110128005259.000|20110128005301.000|TR0|
20110128005301.000|20110128005304.000|TR0|KING:  Is it less friendly now than it was 
20110128005304.000|20110128005306.000|TR0|in the beginning of the term with these 
20110128005306.000|20110128005308.000|TR0|new people? I know from the history, sir, 
20110128005308.000|20110128005310.000|TR0|I covered the labor movement back in the 
20110128005310.000|20110128005313.000|TR0|NAFTA days, I know from the history there 
20110128005313.000|20110128005315.000|TR0|was a lot of tension back then.  Is there 
20110128005315.000|20110128005317.000|TR0|peace now, detente now, or still suspicion?
20110128005317.000|20110128005320.000|TR0|
20110128005320.000|20110128005322.000|TR0|TRUMKA:  I think we have a good working 
20110128005322.000|20110128005324.000|TR0|relationship.  We worked with the cabinet 
20110128005324.000|20110128005326.000|TR0|secretaries.  We have a great working 
20110128005326.000|20110128005329.000|TR0|relationship with Hilda Solis.  She's a 
20110128005329.000|20110128005331.000|TR0|great secretary of labor and we work with 
20110128005331.000|20110128005333.000|TR0|everybody.  So I think it's a good 
20110128005333.000|20110128005336.000|TR0|relationship.
20110128005336.000|20110128005338.000|TR0|
20110128005338.000|20110128005340.000|TR0|KING:  You're in Davos and there was a 
20110128005340.000|20110128005342.000|TR0|report issued here in the United States 
20110128005342.000|20110128005345.000|TR0|today.  I don't want to dive into the 
20110128005345.000|20110128005347.000|TR0|weeds of it about what happened, what 
20110128005347.000|20110128005349.000|TR0|caused the financial collapse back in 
20110128005349.000|20110128005351.000|TR0|2008.  What is the global sense there? Is 
20110128005351.000|20110128005354.000|TR0|there optimism? Is there still unease? Is 
20110128005354.000|20110128005356.000|TR0|it still sort of a, we're not sure what's 
20110128005356.000|20110128005358.000|TR0|around the corner?
20110128005358.000|20110128005401.000|TR0|
20110128005401.000|20110128005403.000|TR0|TRUMKA:  I think it's a little bit of 
20110128005403.000|20110128005405.000|TR0|both, John.  There is a little bit of 
20110128005405.000|20110128005407.000|TR0|optimism, but I think there's still a lot 
20110128005407.000|20110128005410.000|TR0|of concern. We had a panel that I was on, 
20110128005410.000|20110128005412.000|TR0|and we had people from every different 
20110128005412.000|20110128005414.000|TR0|sector that was on the panel.  They're 
20110128005414.000|20110128005416.000|TR0|concerned about this big kick towards 
20110128005416.000|20110128005419.000|TR0|austerity.  They think that it can kick us 
20110128005419.000|20110128005421.000|TR0|back into recession. They're afraid that 
20110128005421.000|20110128005423.000|TR0|in our government, for instance, that the 
20110128005423.000|20110128005426.000|TR0|Republicans won't look at things 
20110128005426.000|20110128005428.000|TR0|realistically, they'll never raise 
20110128005428.000|20110128005430.000|TR0|revenue.  So we won't be able to fix the 
20110128005430.000|20110128005432.000|TR0|deficit problem that we have in the 
20110128005432.000|20110128005435.000|TR0|midterm and long term.
20110128005435.000|20110128005437.000|TR0|
20110128005437.000|20110128005439.000|TR0|I would say it's mixed.  I would say 
20110128005439.000|20110128005441.000|TR0|there's skepticism.  There's some optimism 
20110128005441.000|20110128005444.000|TR0|as well.  There's some good signs out 
20110128005444.000|20110128005446.000|TR0|there.  So we work together and if we can 
20110128005446.000|20110128005448.000|TR0|get this infrastructure program going in 
20110128005448.000|20110128005451.000|TR0|the United States, creates some other 
20110128005451.000|20110128005453.000|TR0|momentum, we can get jobs growing, and 
20110128005453.000|20110128005455.000|TR0|then we'll have a real recovery.  Right 
20110128005455.000|20110128005457.000|TR0|now, Wall Street is seeing a little bit of 
20110128005457.000|20110128005500.000|TR0|a recovery, but Main Street has not seen a 
20110128005500.000|20110128005502.000|TR0|recovery, because we haven't seen any jobs 
20110128005502.000|20110128005504.000|TR0|created or enough to fill the hole that 
20110128005504.000|20110128005506.000|TR0|was created by the recession.  And I think 
20110128005506.000|20110128005509.000|TR0|that's pretty much true around the globe.  
20110128005509.000|20110128005511.000|TR0|Everybody is saying a recovery happens 
20110128005511.000|20110128005513.000|TR0|when we have people back to work.
20110128005513.000|20110128005516.000|TR0|
20110128005516.000|20110128005518.000|TR0|KING:  Richard Trumka is the president of 
20110128005518.000|20110128005520.000|TR0|the AFL-CIO.  Mr. Trumka, thanks for your 
20110128005520.000|20110128005522.000|TR0|time tonight.
20110128005522.000|20110128005525.000|TR0|
20110128005525.000|20110128005527.000|TR0|TRUMKA:  Thanks, John, thanks for having 
20110128005527.000|20110128005529.000|TR0|me on.
20110128005529.000|20110128005532.000|TR0|
20110128005532.000|20110128005534.000|TR0|KING:  Coming up, Pete Dominick on what he 
20110128005534.000|20110128005536.000|TR0|call's the greatest exercise of democracy 
20110128005536.000|20110128005538.000|TR0|ever.
20110128005538.000|20110128005541.000|TR0|
20110128005541.000|20110128005543.000|TR0|PETE DOMINICK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's 
20110128005543.000|20110128005545.000|TR0|right.
20110128005545.000|20110128005547.000|TR0|
20110128005547.000|20110128005550.000|TR0|KING:  Wow.
20110128005550.000|20110128005552.000|TR0|
20110128005552.000|20110128005554.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Stay here.
20110128005554.000|20110128005557.000|TR0|
20110128005557.000|20110128005559.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110128005559.000|20110128005601.000|TR0|
20110128005601.000|20110128005603.000|TR0|KING:  You know my friend Pete Dominick 
20110128005603.000|20110128005606.000|TR0|and I, we share a love of technology, not 
20110128005606.000|20110128005608.000|TR0|as a toy, but as a tool for communicating 
20110128005608.000|20110128005610.000|TR0|and keeping in touch.  And for some times, 
20110128005610.000|20110128005612.000|TR0|for practicing and watching politics. The 
20110128005612.000|20110128005615.000|TR0|president answered questions on YouTube 
20110128005615.000|20110128005617.000|TR0|today which got both Pete and I thinking 
20110128005617.000|20110128005619.000|TR0|about how do we use, how do we use the 
20110128005619.000|20110128005622.000|TR0|Internet in our politics?  This is from 
20110128005622.000|20110128005624.000|TR0|the Pew Research Center, 36 percent of 
20110128005624.000|20110128005626.000|TR0|political junkies on the Internet say it's 
20110128005626.000|20110128005628.000|TR0|a big reason because they want to feel 
20110128005628.000|20110128005631.000|TR0|more connected, 22 percent of people say a 
20110128005631.000|20110128005633.000|TR0|major reason they're on the Internet is 
20110128005633.000|20110128005635.000|TR0|because they get political news faster, 21 
20110128005635.000|20110128005637.000|TR0|percent say they trust that information 
20110128005637.000|20110128005640.000|TR0|from the politicians more than traditional 
20110128005640.000|20110128005642.000|TR0|news sources.  And you see in the middle, 
20110128005642.000|20110128005644.000|TR0|it's not a reason at all, trusting it, 
20110128005644.000|20110128005647.000|TR0|about half of Americans.  So they 
20110128005647.000|20110128005649.000|TR0|understand the politicians are spinning.  
20110128005649.000|20110128005651.000|TR0|But Pete Dominick, you were watching the 
20110128005651.000|20110128005653.000|TR0|president answer questions today.  You've 
20110128005653.000|20110128005656.000|TR0|got a radio show.  You're big on Twitter.  
20110128005656.000|20110128005658.000|TR0|What struck you about the president of the 
20110128005658.000|20110128005700.000|TR0|United States on YouTube?
20110128005700.000|20110128005702.000|TR0|
20110128005702.000|20110128005705.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Well, the president says he 
20110128005705.000|20110128005707.000|TR0|reads 10 letters from ordinary Americans 
20110128005707.000|20110128005709.000|TR0|every day.  And that's fantastic.  But the 
20110128005709.000|20110128005712.000|TR0|Internet offers this president and any 
20110128005712.000|20110128005714.000|TR0|future president the ability to connect 
20110128005714.000|20110128005716.000|TR0|with average, ordinary Americans.  In this 
20110128005716.000|20110128005718.000|TR0|case, it was the YouTube Q   And John 
20110128005718.000|20110128005721.000|TR0|King, it was so great, because how much 
20110128005721.000|20110128005723.000|TR0|press conferences does the president give 
20110128005723.000|20110128005725.000|TR0|a year, on average, John?
20110128005725.000|20110128005727.000|TR0|
20110128005727.000|20110128005730.000|TR0|KING:  I used to say he would give one a 
20110128005730.000|20110128005732.000|TR0|month but that sort of slipped a little 
20110128005732.000|20110128005734.000|TR0|bit, we're lucky if we get five or six a 
20110128005734.000|20110128005737.000|TR0|year.
20110128005737.000|20110128005739.000|TR0|
20110128005739.000|20110128005741.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  But that's reporters.  That's 
20110128005741.000|20110128005743.000|TR0|you guys asking those questions.  In this 
20110128005743.000|20110128005746.000|TR0|case it was Americans getting to ask their 
20110128005746.000|20110128005748.000|TR0|questions.  And John King, it was so good 
20110128005748.000|20110128005750.000|TR0|today, I say there should be an amendment 
20110128005750.000|20110128005753.000|TR0|to the Constitution that says the 
20110128005753.000|20110128005755.000|TR0|president should take questions quarterly
