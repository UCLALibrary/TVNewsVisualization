20110128010007.000|20110128010009.000|TR0|KATHLEEN PARKER, CNN ANCHOR:  Good 
20110128010009.000|20110128010011.000|TR0|evening, I'm Kathleen Parker.
20110128010011.000|20110128010014.000|TR0|
20110128010014.000|20110128010016.000|TR0|ELIOT SPITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  And I'm Eliot 
20110128010016.000|20110128010019.000|TR0|Spitzer.  Welcome to the program.
20110128010019.000|20110128010021.000|TR0|
20110128010021.000|20110128010024.000|TR0|Tonight, breaking news.  Dramatic 
20110128010024.000|20110128010026.000|TR0|developments in Egypt on the third night 
20110128010026.000|20110128010028.000|TR0|of massive and violent protests in cities 
20110128010028.000|20110128010031.000|TR0|all over that country.  In the last few 
20110128010031.000|20110128010033.000|TR0|hours the government has shut down many 
20110128010033.000|20110128010036.000|TR0|means of mass communication to widespread 
20110128010036.000|20110128010038.000|TR0|areas.
20110128010038.000|20110128010041.000|TR0|
20110128010041.000|20110128010043.000|TR0|First the Internet tools of Facebook and 
20110128010043.000|20110128010045.000|TR0|twitter that have been the life blood of 
20110128010045.000|20110128010048.000|TR0|this protest movement providing a platform 
20110128010048.000|20110128010050.000|TR0|for protesters to mobilize their movements 
20110128010050.000|20110128010053.000|TR0|as well.  Cell phone and texting service 
20110128010053.000|20110128010055.000|TR0|have been cut in my parts of the country 
20110128010055.000|20110128010058.000|TR0|along with broadband capability.
20110128010058.000|20110128010100.000|TR0|
20110128010100.000|20110128010102.000|TR0|In the last hour, we've been checking 
20110128010102.000|20110128010105.000|TR0|Internet sources in Egypt, and here's what 
20110128010105.000|20110128010107.000|TR0|we found.  The main Internet provider for 
20110128010107.000|20110128010110.000|TR0|Egypt which is called Tedata.net has two 
20110128010110.000|20110128010112.000|TR0|servers and neither is operating.  The 
20110128010112.000|20110128010115.000|TR0|Egypt.gov Web site shows up as, quote, 
20110128010115.000|20110128010117.000|TR0|"not found."  Even the Web site for the 
20110128010117.000|20110128010119.000|TR0|U.S. embassy in Cairo appears to be dead.
20110128010119.000|20110128010122.000|TR0|
20110128010122.000|20110128010124.000|TR0|Meanwhile, the most massive demonstration 
20110128010124.000|20110128010127.000|TR0|yet is planned for tomorrow.  In just a 
20110128010127.000|20110128010129.000|TR0|short time ago Egyptian authorities issued 
20110128010129.000|20110128010132.000|TR0|an ominous warning saying they will take, 
20110128010132.000|20110128010134.000|TR0|quote, "decisive measures to stop 
20110128010134.000|20110128010136.000|TR0|tomorrow's protests."
20110128010136.000|20110128010139.000|TR0|
20110128010139.000|20110128010141.000|TR0|Those participating in the massive 
20110128010141.000|20110128010144.000|TR0|rebellion say their chief woe is to oust 
20110128010144.000|20110128010146.000|TR0|long-time president, Hosni Mubarak.  
20110128010146.000|20110128010149.000|TR0|Widespread range is directed at a regime 
20110128010149.000|20110128010151.000|TR0|that experts agree has been harshly 
20110128010151.000|20110128010153.000|TR0|repressive, even as the United States has 
20110128010153.000|20110128010156.000|TR0|worked with Egypt as a strong ally in the 
20110128010156.000|20110128010158.000|TR0|troubled Middle East.
20110128010158.000|20110128010201.000|TR0|
20110128010201.000|20110128010203.000|TR0|The collapse of the Egyptian government 
20110128010203.000|20110128010206.000|TR0|could, most experts agree, trigger a wide 
20110128010206.000|20110128010208.000|TR0|and deep crisis across the Middle East.
20110128010208.000|20110128010210.000|TR0|
20110128010210.000|20110128010213.000|TR0|We've done our best to obtain the latest 
20110128010213.000|20110128010215.000|TR0|casualty and arrest figures from the last 
20110128010215.000|20110128010218.000|TR0|couple of days.  So far seven people have 
20110128010218.000|20110128010220.000|TR0|been killed in the demonstrations.  
20110128010220.000|20110128010223.000|TR0|Hundreds of people were injured.  At least 
20110128010223.000|20110128010225.000|TR0|1,000 have been arrested.
20110128010225.000|20110128010227.000|TR0|
20110128010227.000|20110128010230.000|TR0|PARKER:  Right now we're going to talk to 
20110128010230.000|20110128010232.000|TR0|a man who has been in the middle of the 
20110128010232.000|20110128010235.000|TR0|violence.  He was attacked by the police 
20110128010235.000|20110128010237.000|TR0|and thrown in jail during Tuesday's 
20110128010237.000|20110128010240.000|TR0|protests.  He has asked us not to use his 
20110128010240.000|20110128010242.000|TR0|last name.  So we're just going to call 
20110128010242.000|20110128010244.000|TR0|him Ahmed.  He joins us now on the 
20110128010244.000|20110128010247.000|TR0|telephone.
20110128010247.000|20110128010249.000|TR0|
20110128010249.000|20110128010252.000|TR0|Ahmed, tell us what happened to you.
20110128010252.000|20110128010254.000|TR0|
20110128010254.000|20110128010257.000|TR0|AHMED, DOES NOT WANT LAST NAMED USED, 
20110128010257.000|20110128010259.000|TR0|BEATEN, JAILED DURING PROTESTS:  I was 
20110128010259.000|20110128010301.000|TR0|singled out.  I was attacked -- of course 
20110128010301.000|20110128010304.000|TR0|smashed my glasses and smashed my nose and 
20110128010304.000|20110128010306.000|TR0|dragged me to a vehicle that took me 
20110128010306.000|20110128010309.000|TR0|through a police station.  From the police 
20110128010309.000|20110128010311.000|TR0|station to one of the military camps of 
20110128010311.000|20110128010314.000|TR0|the central security.
20110128010314.000|20110128010316.000|TR0|
20110128010316.000|20110128010318.000|TR0|The police in Egypt is militarized.  They 
20110128010318.000|20110128010321.000|TR0|use force of 1.7 million, including 
20110128010321.000|20110128010323.000|TR0|450,000 of our cultures doing the military 
20110128010323.000|20110128010326.000|TR0|service in the police ranks.  And they are 
20110128010326.000|20110128010328.000|TR0|called Central Security.  I was a held 
20110128010328.000|20110128010331.000|TR0|prisoner in one of their camps.  They put 
20110128010331.000|20110128010333.000|TR0|some 300 activists or protesters in one 
20110128010333.000|20110128010335.000|TR0|ward, which made it overcrowded.
20110128010335.000|20110128010338.000|TR0|
20110128010338.000|20110128010340.000|TR0|And I was there (INAUDIBLE) this crowd.  I 
20110128010340.000|20110128010343.000|TR0|assume that there were other -- word also 
20110128010343.000|20110128010345.000|TR0|that there's other people because we kept 
20110128010345.000|20110128010348.000|TR0|on hearing about others that were going to 
20110128010348.000|20110128010350.000|TR0|the same camp.  And of course, loads of 
20110128010350.000|20110128010353.000|TR0|others went to different other camps.
20110128010353.000|20110128010355.000|TR0|
20110128010355.000|20110128010357.000|TR0|And the condition in this ward (INAUDIBLE) 
20110128010357.000|20110128010400.000|TR0|police was terrible because very few were 
20110128010400.000|20110128010402.000|TR0|allowed to go to a toilet.  And they had 
20110128010402.000|20110128010405.000|TR0|to do things where we are -- where we only 
20110128010405.000|20110128010407.000|TR0|had to stay on the cold tiles of the floor 
20110128010407.000|20110128010410.000|TR0|that was very dirty.
20110128010410.000|20110128010412.000|TR0|
20110128010412.000|20110128010414.000|TR0|PARKER:  So Ahmed, do you feel that your 
20110128010414.000|20110128010417.000|TR0|life is in danger?
20110128010417.000|20110128010419.000|TR0|
20110128010419.000|20110128010422.000|TR0|AHMED:  My life is always in danger 
20110128010422.000|20110128010424.000|TR0|because of what's happening. As I heard 
20110128010424.000|20110128010427.000|TR0|when I was in captivity, some policemen 
20110128010427.000|20110128010429.000|TR0|chatter that there are piles of dead 
20110128010429.000|20110128010431.000|TR0|bodies in the hospitals.  And that they 
20110128010431.000|20110128010434.000|TR0|are trying to -- people that were in the 
20110128010434.000|20110128010436.000|TR0|same ward as me.  They had different 
20110128010436.000|20110128010439.000|TR0|injuries including those that were used by 
20110128010439.000|20110128010441.000|TR0|some fire workers.
20110128010441.000|20110128010444.000|TR0|
20110128010444.000|20110128010446.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Are you communicating with other 
20110128010446.000|20110128010448.000|TR0|Egyptian citizens in other cities, in 
20110128010448.000|20110128010451.000|TR0|Suez, in Alexandria, to coordinate, to 
20110128010451.000|20110128010453.000|TR0|make sure that everybody will protest 
20110128010453.000|20110128010456.000|TR0|tomorrow?  How is that communication 
20110128010456.000|20110128010458.000|TR0|system working right now?
20110128010458.000|20110128010501.000|TR0|
20110128010501.000|20110128010503.000|TR0|AHMED:  Before the 25th when were still in 
20110128010503.000|20110128010505.000|TR0|the state (ph) of preparing for the 25th, 
20110128010505.000|20110128010508.000|TR0|I've been traveling around (INAUDIBLE) and 
20110128010508.000|20110128010510.000|TR0|we were coordinating, had meeting.  We had 
20110128010510.000|20110128010513.000|TR0|even smaller demonstrations in preparation 
20110128010513.000|20110128010515.000|TR0|for the big day on the 25th.
20110128010515.000|20110128010518.000|TR0|
20110128010518.000|20110128010520.000|TR0|We managed to share ideas and plans and 
20110128010520.000|20110128010522.000|TR0|everything about how to bring attention 
20110128010522.000|20110128010525.000|TR0|and awareness to the appropriate level on 
20110128010525.000|20110128010527.000|TR0|the 25th so that they could participate 
20110128010527.000|20110128010530.000|TR0|and demand their rights.  And it was a 
20110128010530.000|20110128010532.000|TR0|very exciting time.  Just to hear -- like 
20110128010532.000|20110128010535.000|TR0|as we are preparing that this city is 
20110128010535.000|20110128010537.000|TR0|ready and would take part forcefully.
20110128010537.000|20110128010539.000|TR0|
20110128010539.000|20110128010542.000|TR0|And this other city is also following us, 
20110128010542.000|20110128010544.000|TR0|all their support.  How many cities were 
20110128010544.000|20110128010547.000|TR0|are having.  And at the end we realize 
20110128010547.000|20110128010549.000|TR0|that we have most of the country.  Most of 
20110128010549.000|20110128010552.000|TR0|the country was going on demonstrations on 
20110128010552.000|20110128010554.000|TR0|that day.  And on the 25th I couldn't stop 
20110128010554.000|20110128010556.000|TR0|my eyes from actually crying with joy.  
20110128010556.000|20110128010559.000|TR0|Seeing the huge number of people and their 
20110128010559.000|20110128010601.000|TR0|absolute enthusiasm and the new slogan 
20110128010601.000|20110128010604.000|TR0|that they came up with.       Because we 
20110128010604.000|20110128010606.000|TR0|didn't invent the slogan that they were 
20110128010606.000|20110128010609.000|TR0|saying on that day which is (speaking in 
20110128010609.000|20110128010611.000|TR0|foreign language), the people want to 
20110128010611.000|20110128010613.000|TR0|bring down this regime.
20110128010613.000|20110128010616.000|TR0|
20110128010616.000|20110128010618.000|TR0|PARKER:  Ahmed, are you hoping for support 
20110128010618.000|20110128010621.000|TR0|from the United States?
20110128010621.000|20110128010623.000|TR0|
20110128010623.000|20110128010626.000|TR0|AHMED:  We have been very disappointed 
20110128010626.000|20110128010628.000|TR0|with the United States, as the people of 
20110128010628.000|20110128010630.000|TR0|Egypt.  The people of Egypt are only 
20110128010630.000|20110128010633.000|TR0|wanting to see Egypt a free and democratic 
20110128010633.000|20110128010635.000|TR0|country.  And we would always assume this 
20110128010635.000|20110128010638.000|TR0|is our model, being the patron of freedom 
20110128010638.000|20110128010640.000|TR0|and democracy in the world. And the leader 
20110128010640.000|20110128010643.000|TR0|of the free world.
20110128010643.000|20110128010645.000|TR0|
20110128010645.000|20110128010647.000|TR0|And we can't understand how come this 
20110128010647.000|20110128010650.000|TR0|leader of the free world is looking the 
20110128010650.000|20110128010652.000|TR0|other way when it comes to our rights for 
20110128010652.000|20110128010655.000|TR0|freedom. Although the regime that they 
20110128010655.000|20110128010657.000|TR0|like -- the despotic regime that I support 
20110128010657.000|20110128010700.000|TR0|very much, always demonizes the image of 
20110128010700.000|20110128010702.000|TR0|the United States. Always putting the 
20110128010702.000|20110128010704.000|TR0|blame on the United States for anything.  
20110128010704.000|20110128010707.000|TR0|Always trying to raise conspiracy theories 
20110128010707.000|20110128010709.000|TR0|against the United States and the region.
20110128010709.000|20110128010712.000|TR0|
20110128010712.000|20110128010714.000|TR0|And the people, they just want to live in 
20110128010714.000|20110128010717.000|TR0|a democracy and freedom.  Of course, also, 
20110128010717.000|20110128010719.000|TR0|what's happened in Tunisia and what's 
20110128010719.000|20110128010721.000|TR0|happening Egypt is proving how false is 
20110128010721.000|20110128010724.000|TR0|the assumption that they have been using 
20110128010724.000|20110128010726.000|TR0|always as -- that if there is any 
20110128010726.000|20110128010729.000|TR0|alternative to a despotic regime -- sorry.
20110128010729.000|20110128010731.000|TR0|
20110128010731.000|20110128010734.000|TR0|To a despotic regime, it's only the 
20110128010734.000|20110128010736.000|TR0|Islamists.  What you have seen in Tunisia, 
20110128010736.000|20110128010739.000|TR0|that the Islamists were not behind what 
20110128010739.000|20110128010741.000|TR0|happened.  In Egypt the Islamists were not 
20110128010741.000|20110128010743.000|TR0|behind what happened in Egypt.  Even the 
20110128010743.000|20110128010746.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) are still considering to 
20110128010746.000|20110128010748.000|TR0|actually take part in tomorrow's events.
20110128010748.000|20110128010751.000|TR0|
20110128010751.000|20110128010753.000|TR0|All these things are made by the people 
20110128010753.000|20110128010756.000|TR0|and not by any Islamist organization or 
20110128010756.000|20110128010758.000|TR0|whatever.  If there is democracy in the 
20110128010758.000|20110128010800.000|TR0|region, it will not give power on a plate 
20110128010800.000|20110128010803.000|TR0|of gold to the Islamists.  They are only 
20110128010803.000|20110128010805.000|TR0|part of the picture of the nation.  Of 
20110128010805.000|20110128010808.000|TR0|course, they are playing a role in their 
20110128010808.000|20110128010810.000|TR0|place, and that's all.  But they are not 
20110128010810.000|20110128010813.000|TR0|ruling.  They are not taking over.  That's 
20110128010813.000|20110128010815.000|TR0|impossible.
20110128010815.000|20110128010817.000|TR0|
20110128010817.000|20110128010820.000|TR0|The Egyptians want to rebuild their 
20110128010820.000|20110128010822.000|TR0|country and to have good relations with 
20110128010822.000|20110128010825.000|TR0|the rest of the world.  And to put back 
20110128010825.000|20110128010827.000|TR0|Egypt into its natural place that we have 
20110128010827.000|20110128010830.000|TR0|lost for the kids.
20110128010830.000|20110128010832.000|TR0|
20110128010832.000|20110128010834.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Ahmed, tomorrow the protests are 
20110128010834.000|20110128010837.000|TR0|supposedly going to be the biggest yet.  
20110128010837.000|20110128010839.000|TR0|And the Muslim Brotherhood obviously is 
20110128010839.000|20110128010842.000|TR0|participating and today Mohamed ElBaradei 
20110128010842.000|20110128010844.000|TR0|returned.
20110128010844.000|20110128010847.000|TR0|
20110128010847.000|20110128010849.000|TR0|How many people do you expect in the 
20110128010849.000|20110128010851.000|TR0|streets tomorrow?  What will -- what will 
20110128010851.000|20110128010854.000|TR0|happen in downtown Cairo tomorrow at the 
20110128010854.000|20110128010856.000|TR0|height of these protests?
20110128010856.000|20110128010859.000|TR0|
20110128010859.000|20110128010901.000|TR0|AHMED:  This is a very tough question 
20110128010901.000|20110128010904.000|TR0|because in terms of so many things.  But 
20110128010904.000|20110128010906.000|TR0|what I expect is there are incredible 
20110128010906.000|20110128010908.000|TR0|numbers of people everywhere trying to 
20110128010908.000|20110128010911.000|TR0|take part and the police on the other hand 
20110128010911.000|20110128010913.000|TR0|are trying to stop this in every possible 
20110128010913.000|20110128010916.000|TR0|way.       I just got news now from 
20110128010916.000|20110128010918.000|TR0|someone who is in my network saying that 
20110128010918.000|20110128010921.000|TR0|one of his guys in his network had seen by 
20110128010921.000|20110128010923.000|TR0|his own eyes the security agents in the 
20110128010923.000|20110128010925.000|TR0|Tahrir, the main square, and downtown are 
20110128010925.000|20110128010928.000|TR0|throwing petrol on some cars in order to 
20110128010928.000|20110128010930.000|TR0|put them on fire, like they did on the 
20110128010930.000|20110128010933.000|TR0|25th.
20110128010933.000|20110128010935.000|TR0|
20110128010935.000|20110128010938.000|TR0|Maybe in an attempt to abort the events of 
20110128010938.000|20110128010940.000|TR0|tomorrow beforehand by trying to -- I 
20110128010940.000|20110128010942.000|TR0|don't know, maybe make a curfew after a 
20110128010942.000|20110128010945.000|TR0|large sabotage to take place now within 
20110128010945.000|20110128010947.000|TR0|this hour or the next couple of hours.
20110128010947.000|20110128010950.000|TR0|
20110128010950.000|20110128010952.000|TR0|So the authorities and the police, they 
20110128010952.000|20110128010955.000|TR0|always try to resort to this solution of 
20110128010955.000|20110128010957.000|TR0|using hired thugs of ex-criminals, or even 
20110128010957.000|20110128010959.000|TR0|their own agents privately in civilian 
20110128010959.000|20110128011002.000|TR0|clothes, into starting riots and starting 
20110128011002.000|20110128011004.000|TR0|violence, sabotage, putting things on fire 
20110128011004.000|20110128011007.000|TR0|and so on and so forth.
20110128011007.000|20110128011009.000|TR0|
20110128011009.000|20110128011012.000|TR0|So it's very difficult to say anything 
20110128011012.000|20110128011014.000|TR0|about what I expect to happen tomorrow.  
20110128011014.000|20110128011016.000|TR0|But I have very high hopes.  And I have a 
20110128011016.000|20110128011019.000|TR0|lot of faith in the Egyptian people that 
20110128011019.000|20110128011021.000|TR0|are standing now.  And maybe we can see 
20110128011021.000|20110128011024.000|TR0|the sleeping giant standing.
20110128011024.000|20110128011026.000|TR0|
20110128011026.000|20110128011029.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, Ahmed, you've already been 
20110128011029.000|20110128011031.000|TR0|arrested, interrogated and charged and 
20110128011031.000|20110128011033.000|TR0|beaten.  Are you going to go to this 
20110128011033.000|20110128011036.000|TR0|protest tomorrow?
20110128011036.000|20110128011038.000|TR0|
20110128011038.000|20110128011041.000|TR0|AHMED:  I wanted to.  But the condition of 
20110128011041.000|20110128011043.000|TR0|my face unfortunately will not allow me 
20110128011043.000|20110128011046.000|TR0|because I'm -- to fix my nose I have to 
20110128011046.000|20110128011048.000|TR0|maintain it wrapped in a perfect little 
20110128011048.000|20110128011050.000|TR0|way now until I can put plaster on it in a 
20110128011050.000|20110128011053.000|TR0|couple of days when the swelling is 
20110128011053.000|20110128011055.000|TR0|reduced.
20110128011055.000|20110128011058.000|TR0|
20110128011058.000|20110128011100.000|TR0|So I will not be able to be on the streets 
20110128011100.000|20110128011103.000|TR0|like I was.  But my heart will be there.  
20110128011103.000|20110128011105.000|TR0|And perhaps I wouldn't be able to hold 
20110128011105.000|20110128011107.000|TR0|myself. I mean, with the advice of 
20110128011107.000|20110128011110.000|TR0|everybody I have to stay.  But probably 
20110128011110.000|20110128011112.000|TR0|I'll just go out.  I don't know.
20110128011112.000|20110128011115.000|TR0|
20110128011115.000|20110128011117.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right, Ahmed, listen, please 
20110128011117.000|20110128011120.000|TR0|stay safe.  And thanks so much for being 
20110128011120.000|20110128011122.000|TR0|with us tonight.
20110128011122.000|20110128011125.000|TR0|
20110128011125.000|20110128011127.000|TR0|AHMED:  You're welcome.  Thank you.
20110128011127.000|20110128011129.000|TR0|
20110128011129.000|20110128011132.000|TR0|PARKER:  Meanwhile, we just received some 
20110128011132.000|20110128011134.000|TR0|dramatic video from one of today's 
20110128011134.000|20110128011137.000|TR0|protests.  It may be disturbing to some 
20110128011137.000|20110128011139.000|TR0|viewers.
20110128011139.000|20110128011142.000|TR0|
20110128011142.000|20110128011144.000|TR0|We see a protester being shot as he rushes 
20110128011144.000|20110128011146.000|TR0|out to face police. Awful, disturbing 
20110128011146.000|20110128011149.000|TR0|pictures.  Dramatic depiction of what is 
20110128011149.000|20110128011151.000|TR0|going on in Egypt.  Very disturbing.
20110128011151.000|20110128011154.000|TR0|
20110128011154.000|20110128011156.000|TR0|Later in the program we'll go back to 
20110128011156.000|20110128011159.000|TR0|Cairo to check in with CNN senior 
20110128011159.000|20110128011201.000|TR0|international correspondent Bill Wedeman 
20110128011201.000|20110128011203.000|TR0|to get the latest on the massive uprising 
20110128011203.000|20110128011206.000|TR0|that is rocking Egypt.  Stay with us.
20110128011206.000|20110128011208.000|TR0|
20110128011208.000|20110128011211.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110128011211.000|20110128011213.000|TR0|
20110128011213.000|20110128011216.000|TR0|SPITZER:  It was a formal setting today 
20110128011216.000|20110128011218.000|TR0|for what's still thought of a grassroots 
20110128011218.000|20110128011220.000|TR0|movement.  Conservative activists packed 
20110128011220.000|20110128011223.000|TR0|the Senate hearing room for the very first 
20110128011223.000|20110128011225.000|TR0|meeting of the new Senate Tea Party caucus.

20110128011228.000|20110128011230.000|TR0|While the movement is often credited with 
20110128011230.000|20110128011233.000|TR0|the Republican sweep of Congress last 
20110128011233.000|20110128011235.000|TR0|November, the new caucus only has four 
20110128011235.000|20110128011237.000|TR0|members so far.
20110128011237.000|20110128011240.000|TR0|
20110128011240.000|20110128011242.000|TR0|PARKER:  Joining us from Washington 
20110128011242.000|20110128011245.000|TR0|tonight is Republican Senator Mike Lee of 
20110128011245.000|20110128011247.000|TR0|Utah, who's not only a founding member of 
20110128011247.000|20110128011250.000|TR0|the Tea Party caucus, but also introduced 
20110128011250.000|20110128011252.000|TR0|a balanced budget amendment today, which 
20110128011252.000|20110128011254.000|TR0|sort of speaks to the heart of what the 
20110128011254.000|20110128011257.000|TR0|Tea Party has fought for.
20110128011257.000|20110128011259.000|TR0|
20110128011259.000|20110128011302.000|TR0|Senator, welcome.
20110128011302.000|20110128011304.000|TR0|
20110128011304.000|20110128011307.000|TR0|SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH:  Thank you.  It's 
20110128011307.000|20110128011309.000|TR0|good to be with you.
20110128011309.000|20110128011311.000|TR0|
20110128011311.000|20110128011314.000|TR0|PARKER:  So you had your first Tea Party 
20110128011314.000|20110128011316.000|TR0|caucus meeting today. You know, the great 
20110128011316.000|20110128011319.000|TR0|thing about grassroots movement is that 
20110128011319.000|20110128011321.000|TR0|they're organic and they're passionate and 
20110128011321.000|20110128011324.000|TR0|spontaneous.  And now you're sort of 
20110128011324.000|20110128011326.000|TR0|institutionalizing it.  Are you not a 
20110128011326.000|20110128011328.000|TR0|little worried that you're going to steal 
20110128011328.000|20110128011331.000|TR0|the passion from the very movement that 
20110128011331.000|20110128011333.000|TR0|brought you there?
20110128011333.000|20110128011336.000|TR0|
20110128011336.000|20110128011338.000|TR0|LEE:  No.  Not at all.  Because we're not 
20110128011338.000|20110128011341.000|TR0|institutionalizing it. Quite to the 
20110128011341.000|20110128011343.000|TR0|contrary, we've gone out of our way to 
20110128011343.000|20110128011345.000|TR0|make sure that this stays, as you say, an 
20110128011345.000|20110128011348.000|TR0|organic, spontaneous, political phenomenon 
20110128011348.000|20110128011350.000|TR0|that it is.
20110128011350.000|20110128011353.000|TR0|
20110128011353.000|20110128011355.000|TR0|We're not trying to speak for the Tea 
20110128011355.000|20110128011358.000|TR0|Party movement.  We're trying to create a 
20110128011358.000|20110128011400.000|TR0|forum, a venue, if you will, for people 
20110128011400.000|20110128011402.000|TR0|who sympathize with the Tea Party 
20110128011402.000|20110128011405.000|TR0|movement, consider themselves part of it 
20110128011405.000|20110128011407.000|TR0|to come and communicate with some U.S. 
20110128011407.000|20110128011410.000|TR0|senators.
20110128011410.000|20110128011412.000|TR0|
20110128011412.000|20110128011415.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Senator, welcome back to the 
20110128011415.000|20110128011417.000|TR0|show.  And congratulations on being sworn 
20110128011417.000|20110128011419.000|TR0|in.  I don't think you've been sworn in 
20110128011419.000|20110128011422.000|TR0|when we chatted last.
20110128011422.000|20110128011424.000|TR0|
20110128011424.000|20110128011427.000|TR0|I listened to Michele Bachmann's address 
20110128011427.000|20110128011429.000|TR0|to the nation the other night.  Her 
20110128011429.000|20110128011432.000|TR0|response to the president.  What I kept 
20110128011432.000|20110128011434.000|TR0|waiting for were numbers, some explanation 
20110128011434.000|20110128011436.000|TR0|of how the Tea Party was going to balance 
20110128011436.000|20110128011439.000|TR0|the budget.  I didn't get it.
20110128011439.000|20110128011441.000|TR0|
20110128011441.000|20110128011444.000|TR0|Today I hear that Senator Rand Paul has 
20110128011444.000|20110128011446.000|TR0|introduce a bill that would cut $500 
20110128011446.000|20110128011449.000|TR0|billion.  Do you subscribe to that $500 
20110128011449.000|20110128011451.000|TR0|billion figure? And how -- if you do, how 
20110128011451.000|20110128011453.000|TR0|are you going to cut $500 billion from the 
20110128011453.000|20110128011456.000|TR0|budget?
20110128011456.000|20110128011458.000|TR0|
20110128011458.000|20110128011501.000|TR0|LEE:  Well, I haven't reviewed the bill in 
20110128011501.000|20110128011503.000|TR0|detail yet.  I agree with the basic 
20110128011503.000|20110128011506.000|TR0|principles underlying it, which is we've 
20110128011506.000|20110128011508.000|TR0|got to find some place to cut it and cut 
20110128011508.000|20110128011511.000|TR0|aggressively.
20110128011511.000|20110128011513.000|TR0|
20110128011513.000|20110128011515.000|TR0|I am more focused right now on the 
20110128011515.000|20110128011518.000|TR0|balanced budget amendment.  I think we 
20110128011518.000|20110128011520.000|TR0|need to get that done and get members of 
20110128011520.000|20110128011523.000|TR0|Congress to agree with the American 
20110128011523.000|20110128011525.000|TR0|people, who overwhelmingly favor the 
20110128011525.000|20110128011528.000|TR0|passage of a balanced budget amendment, 
20110128011528.000|20110128011530.000|TR0|telling Congress it can't continue to act 
20110128011530.000|20110128011532.000|TR0|in perpetuity, borrowing on the credit 
20110128011532.000|20110128011535.000|TR0|card that will have to be paid one day by 
20110128011535.000|20110128011537.000|TR0|our unborn children.
20110128011537.000|20110128011540.000|TR0|
20110128011540.000|20110128011542.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, that -- Senator, that's -- 
20110128011542.000|20110128011545.000|TR0|you know, we can discuss the balanced 
20110128011545.000|20110128011547.000|TR0|budget amendment, which by the way would 
20110128011547.000|20110128011549.000|TR0|require you this year to cut about $1.3 
20110128011549.000|20110128011552.000|TR0|trillion.  But let's start with a small 
20110128011552.000|20110128011554.000|TR0|number.       Explain to me how are you 
20110128011554.000|20110128011557.000|TR0|going to cut $500 billion from this year's 
20110128011557.000|20110128011559.000|TR0|budget?  I keep waiting for the answer.  
20110128011559.000|20110128011602.000|TR0|That was the whole platform you ran for 
20110128011602.000|20110128011604.000|TR0|the United States Senate on.  Where are 
20110128011604.000|20110128011606.000|TR0|the cuts coming from?  How are you going 
20110128011606.000|20110128011609.000|TR0|to cut $500 billion?
20110128011609.000|20110128011611.000|TR0|
20110128011611.000|20110128011614.000|TR0|LEE:  Well, Eliot, first of all, you have 
20110128011614.000|20110128011616.000|TR0|to realize.  The amendment that I've 
20110128011616.000|20110128011619.000|TR0|called for would take effect two years 
20110128011619.000|20110128011621.000|TR0|after it passed down at the U.S. Congress 
20110128011621.000|20110128011623.000|TR0|by the requisite two-thirds margin in both 
20110128011623.000|20110128011626.000|TR0|the House and the Senate.
20110128011626.000|20110128011628.000|TR0|
20110128011628.000|20110128011631.000|TR0|So this is something that we would have a 
20110128011631.000|20110128011633.000|TR0|few years to prepare for.  Probably about 
20110128011633.000|20110128011636.000|TR0|three years away.  Perhaps four by the 
20110128011636.000|20110128011638.000|TR0|time it's all said and done.  So we would 
20110128011638.000|20110128011640.000|TR0|be able to prepare for this.
20110128011640.000|20110128011643.000|TR0|
20110128011643.000|20110128011645.000|TR0|Secondly, as to where we're going to find 
20110128011645.000|20110128011648.000|TR0|the ability to cut, I think we have to 
20110128011648.000|20110128011650.000|TR0|look at every single program.  And I think 
20110128011650.000|20110128011653.000|TR0|we have to consider across-the-board 
20110128011653.000|20110128011655.000|TR0|programmatic cuts on a percentage basis. 
20110128011655.000|20110128011657.000|TR0|Everything has to be on the table.
20110128011657.000|20110128011700.000|TR0|
20110128011700.000|20110128011702.000|TR0|In the past you have Republicans who have 
20110128011702.000|20110128011705.000|TR0|been unwilling to consider any cut 
20110128011705.000|20110128011707.000|TR0|whatsoever in any defense related program. 
20110128011707.000|20110128011710.000|TR0| And I think Republicans are now 
20110128011710.000|20110128011712.000|TR0|acknowledging across the board that that's 
20110128011712.000|20110128011714.000|TR0|no longer on the table.  And you've got 
20110128011714.000|20110128011717.000|TR0|people outside the Republican Party who've 
20110128011717.000|20110128011719.000|TR0|been unwilling ever to consider any price 
20110128011719.000|20110128011722.000|TR0|controls within entitlements.
20110128011722.000|20110128011724.000|TR0|
20110128011724.000|20110128011727.000|TR0|And I think you've got people in both 
20110128011727.000|20110128011729.000|TR0|parties recognizing that's not a 
20110128011729.000|20110128011731.000|TR0|possibility anymore.  So we have to be 
20110128011731.000|20110128011734.000|TR0|willing to cut within every department, 
20110128011734.000|20110128011736.000|TR0|within every program within the federal 
20110128011736.000|20110128011739.000|TR0|government. It's the only way we're going 
20110128011739.000|20110128011741.000|TR0|to be able to do this.
20110128011741.000|20110128011744.000|TR0|
20110128011744.000|20110128011746.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, Senator, Rand Paul also 
20110128011746.000|20110128011748.000|TR0|told CNN not long ago that he was 
20110128011748.000|20110128011751.000|TR0|interested in cutting all foreign aid 
20110128011751.000|20110128011753.000|TR0|including to Israel.  Do you agree with 
20110128011753.000|20110128011756.000|TR0|that?
20110128011756.000|20110128011758.000|TR0|
20110128011758.000|20110128011801.000|TR0|LEE:  I certainly don't agree with cutting 
20110128011801.000|20110128011803.000|TR0|aid to Israel.  Israel is our most 
20110128011803.000|20110128011805.000|TR0|important ally certainly in the Middle 
20110128011805.000|20110128011808.000|TR0|East.  Probably -- perhaps in the entire 
20110128011808.000|20110128011810.000|TR0|world.  And we have an important military 
20110128011810.000|20110128011813.000|TR0|objective there.
20110128011813.000|20110128011815.000|TR0|
20110128011815.000|20110128011818.000|TR0|Moreover, our aid to Israel is entirely 
20110128011818.000|20110128011820.000|TR0|military.  And that's money that many 
20110128011820.000|20110128011822.000|TR0|experts estimate is a good investment for 
20110128011822.000|20110128011825.000|TR0|us in the sense that to get the same 
20110128011825.000|20110128011827.000|TR0|military bank for our buck we have to 
20110128011827.000|20110128011830.000|TR0|spend several times more than that if we 
20110128011830.000|20110128011832.000|TR0|did it all on our own.
20110128011832.000|20110128011835.000|TR0|
20110128011835.000|20110128011837.000|TR0|PARKER:  OK.  So we already have dissent 
20110128011837.000|20110128011839.000|TR0|within the four-man caucus.  Are you 
20110128011839.000|20110128011842.000|TR0|speaking of --
20110128011842.000|20110128011844.000|TR0|
20110128011844.000|20110128011847.000|TR0|LEE:  We are, of course, distinct 
20110128011847.000|20110128011849.000|TR0|individuals.  We have our own opinions and 
20110128011849.000|20110128011852.000|TR0|our own minds.  We have never purported to 
20110128011852.000|20110128011854.000|TR0|agree on everything.
20110128011854.000|20110128011857.000|TR0|
20110128011857.000|20110128011859.000|TR0|PARKER:  Excellent.  Well, what -- are you 
20110128011859.000|20110128011901.000|TR0|concerned at all that your numbers are so 
20110128011901.000|20110128011904.000|TR0|few at this point?  I mean you've got just 
20110128011904.000|20110128011906.000|TR0|four senators on board now.  Notably 
20110128011906.000|20110128011909.000|TR0|missing are people like Scott Brown and 
20110128011909.000|20110128011911.000|TR0|Marco Rubio, who were very successful as a 
20110128011911.000|20110128011914.000|TR0|result of Tea Party support?
20110128011914.000|20110128011916.000|TR0|
20110128011916.000|20110128011918.000|TR0|LEE:  No, I'm not worried about that at 
20110128011918.000|20110128011921.000|TR0|all.  Look, the purpose of this was never 
20110128011921.000|20110128011923.000|TR0|to build a huge caucus.  Not withstanding 
20110128011923.000|20110128011926.000|TR0|the fact that we've been invited all 100 
20110128011926.000|20110128011928.000|TR0|members of the U.S. Senate to join us. I'd 
20110128011928.000|20110128011931.000|TR0|love to have them all join us.
20110128011931.000|20110128011933.000|TR0|
20110128011933.000|20110128011935.000|TR0|But the effectiveness, what we're trying 
20110128011935.000|20110128011938.000|TR0|to do here, will be in no way diminished.  
20110128011938.000|20110128011940.000|TR0|Even if the caucus remains at only three 
20110128011940.000|20110128011943.000|TR0|or four senators.  Because all we're 
20110128011943.000|20110128011945.000|TR0|trying to do here is to create a forum. A 
20110128011945.000|20110128011948.000|TR0|venue in which people who agree with the 
20110128011948.000|20110128011950.000|TR0|principles of the Tea Party movement can 
20110128011950.000|20110128011952.000|TR0|come and communicate with the few U.S. 
20110128011952.000|20110128011955.000|TR0|senators about what they feel passionately 
20110128011955.000|20110128011957.000|TR0|about.
20110128011957.000|20110128012000.000|TR0|
20110128012000.000|20110128012002.000|TR0|Obviously that's better if we have more.  
20110128012002.000|20110128012005.000|TR0|But it doesn't worry me at all if it 
20110128012005.000|20110128012007.000|TR0|remains at only three or four.
20110128012007.000|20110128012009.000|TR0|
20110128012009.000|20110128012012.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, Senator, you and I are 
20110128012012.000|20110128012014.000|TR0|both lawyers.  And I think lawyers have 
20110128012014.000|20110128012017.000|TR0|this unfortunate habit of asking a 
20110128012017.000|20110128012019.000|TR0|question until they get an answer.  Your 
20110128012019.000|20110128012022.000|TR0|balanced budget amendment would require 
20110128012022.000|20110128012024.000|TR0|$1.3 trillion in cuts.  You don't want to 
20110128012024.000|20110128012026.000|TR0|do that now.
20110128012026.000|20110128012029.000|TR0|
20110128012029.000|20110128012031.000|TR0|Senate Rand Paul says $500 billion.  I've 
20110128012031.000|20110128012034.000|TR0|asked you where is it coming from, you 
20110128012034.000|20110128012036.000|TR0|said -- I haven't heard one number.  Let's 
20110128012036.000|20110128012039.000|TR0|take an easy number.  Give me $250 billion 
20110128012039.000|20110128012041.000|TR0|in cuts right now, specific programmatic 
20110128012041.000|20110128012043.000|TR0|cuts.  It was your platform when you ran 
20110128012043.000|20110128012046.000|TR0|for the Senate. It was the bread and 
20110128012046.000|20110128012048.000|TR0|butter of the Tea Party movement.
20110128012048.000|20110128012051.000|TR0|
20110128012051.000|20110128012053.000|TR0|The American public is desperate for 
20110128012053.000|20110128012056.000|TR0|numbers to know where it's coming from.  
20110128012056.000|20110128012058.000|TR0|Where is it?
20110128012058.000|20110128012100.000|TR0|
20110128012100.000|20110128012103.000|TR0|LEE:  Eliot, I've answered this question 
20110128012103.000|20110128012105.000|TR0|many times both today and when I was on 
20110128012105.000|20110128012108.000|TR0|your program last.  We have to consider 
20110128012108.000|20110128012110.000|TR0|percentage based cuts in every program.  
20110128012110.000|20110128012113.000|TR0|It has to be across the board. Everything 
20110128012113.000|20110128012115.000|TR0|has to be cut.  And moreover, it has 
20110128012115.000|20110128012117.000|TR0|become the habit of those who want only to 
20110128012117.000|20110128012120.000|TR0|interfere with and stop any and all 
20110128012120.000|20110128012122.000|TR0|efforts for a balanced budget amendment, 
20110128012122.000|20110128012125.000|TR0|to say tell me right now where Congress is 
20110128012125.000|20110128012127.000|TR0|going to do that.
20110128012127.000|20110128012130.000|TR0|
20110128012130.000|20110128012132.000|TR0|I can't look two or three years in the 
20110128012132.000|20110128012134.000|TR0|future.  I can't predict where Congress 
20110128012134.000|20110128012137.000|TR0|might agree exactly how much money they're 
20110128012137.000|20110128012139.000|TR0|going to take out of which program.  
20110128012139.000|20110128012142.000|TR0|That's one of the things people bring up 
20110128012142.000|20110128012144.000|TR0|in order to stop the movement.
20110128012144.000|20110128012147.000|TR0|
20110128012147.000|20110128012149.000|TR0|But the fact is, the American people 
20110128012149.000|20110128012151.000|TR0|overwhelmingly support the idea of a 
20110128012151.000|20110128012154.000|TR0|balanced budget amendment.  Because they 
20110128012154.000|20110128012156.000|TR0|understand that unless or until you get 
20110128012156.000|20110128012159.000|TR0|Congress to agree to severe restrictions 
20110128012159.000|20110128012201.000|TR0|on its ability to draw from what has in 
20110128012201.000|20110128012204.000|TR0|the past been a virtually limitless well, 
20110128012204.000|20110128012206.000|TR0|they're never going to stop borrowing 
20110128012206.000|20110128012208.000|TR0|money from our unborn grandchildren.
20110128012208.000|20110128012211.000|TR0|
20110128012211.000|20110128012213.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Look, Senator, I agree we need 
20110128012213.000|20110128012216.000|TR0|to cut.  But I just want to know where you 
20110128012216.000|20110128012218.000|TR0|want to cut.  You said across the board.  
20110128012218.000|20110128012221.000|TR0|Are you telling me you're going to cut 
20110128012221.000|20110128012223.000|TR0|one-sixth of that 18 percent, 16 percent 
20110128012223.000|20110128012225.000|TR0|-- excuse me -- of the defense budget, 
20110128012225.000|20110128012228.000|TR0|Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?       
20110128012228.000|20110128012230.000|TR0|And if presumably your answer to that is 
20110128012230.000|20110128012233.000|TR0|going to be no, because you can't, then 
20110128012233.000|20110128012235.000|TR0|are you going to eliminate all 
20110128012235.000|20110128012238.000|TR0|discretionary spending across the entirety 
20110128012238.000|20110128012240.000|TR0|of the federal government?  That's why 
20110128012240.000|20110128012243.000|TR0|these are real decisions.  You're now a 
20110128012243.000|20110128012245.000|TR0|United States senator.
20110128012245.000|20110128012247.000|TR0|
20110128012247.000|20110128012250.000|TR0|I want to know what the answers are.  And 
20110128012250.000|20110128012252.000|TR0|that's why you were elected.  And I'm 
20110128012252.000|20110128012255.000|TR0|waiting for the answer.  You haven't 
20110128012255.000|20110128012257.000|TR0|answered it.
20110128012257.000|20110128012300.000|TR0|
20110128012300.000|20110128012302.000|TR0|LEE:  OK.  Well, I haven't answered that 
20110128012302.000|20110128012304.000|TR0|because I can't foretell the future.  I 
20110128012304.000|20110128012307.000|TR0|can't foretell where Congress --
20110128012307.000|20110128012309.000|TR0|
20110128012309.000|20110128012312.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110128012312.000|20110128012314.000|TR0|
20110128012314.000|20110128012317.000|TR0|SPITZER:  No.  This year, Senator.
20110128012317.000|20110128012319.000|TR0|
20110128012319.000|20110128012321.000|TR0|LEE:  I can't foretell what's going to 
20110128012321.000|20110128012324.000|TR0|happen three years from now when 
20110128012324.000|20110128012326.000|TR0|optimistically speaking this is not only 
20110128012326.000|20110128012329.000|TR0|been passed by the House, by the requisite 
20110128012329.000|20110128012331.000|TR0|two-thirds margin, by the Senate, by the 
20110128012331.000|20110128012334.000|TR0|requisite two-thirds margin, and then 
20110128012334.000|20110128012336.000|TR0|ratified by three-fourths of the state 
20110128012336.000|20110128012338.000|TR0|legislatures.  And then after that two 
20110128012338.000|20110128012341.000|TR0|years have elapsed.
20110128012341.000|20110128012343.000|TR0|
20110128012343.000|20110128012346.000|TR0|What we need to agree on right is what 
20110128012346.000|20110128012348.000|TR0|Americans overwhelmingly agree upon, which 
20110128012348.000|20110128012351.000|TR0|is that we have to take away that power 
20110128012351.000|20110128012353.000|TR0|from Congress.  At that point the 
20110128012353.000|20110128012355.000|TR0|negotiation process can begin and we'll 
20110128012355.000|20110128012358.000|TR0|figure out.  Now maybe in some areas it 
20110128012358.000|20110128012400.000|TR0|will be cuts of 15 percent. Maybe in other 
20110128012400.000|20110128012403.000|TR0|areas it might be cuts of 25 percent or 
20110128012403.000|20110128012405.000|TR0|more.
20110128012405.000|20110128012408.000|TR0|
20110128012408.000|20110128012410.000|TR0|I don't know.  But the important part 
20110128012410.000|20110128012412.000|TR0|right now is we have to get this passed.  
20110128012412.000|20110128012415.000|TR0|And I'm not going to let anyone derail it 
20110128012415.000|20110128012417.000|TR0|by simply saying we can't all agree right 
20110128012417.000|20110128012420.000|TR0|now on where we're going to cut two or 
20110128012420.000|20110128012422.000|TR0|three years from now.
20110128012422.000|20110128012425.000|TR0|
20110128012425.000|20110128012427.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Senator, I am not talking about 
20110128012427.000|20110128012429.000|TR0|your balanced budget amendment that would 
20110128012429.000|20110128012432.000|TR0|require $1.3 trillion in cuts.  I'm 
20110128012432.000|20110128012434.000|TR0|talking about this year's budget right now 
20110128012434.000|20110128012437.000|TR0|that has to be considered by the body 
20110128012437.000|20110128012439.000|TR0|you're a member of.
20110128012439.000|20110128012442.000|TR0|
20110128012442.000|20110128012444.000|TR0|LEE:  Yes.  And Eliot --
20110128012444.000|20110128012446.000|TR0|
20110128012446.000|20110128012449.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And I'm looking for where those 
20110128012449.000|20110128012451.000|TR0|cuts are coming from.
20110128012451.000|20110128012454.000|TR0|
20110128012454.000|20110128012456.000|TR0|LEE:  And Eliot, I'm going to tell you, 
20110128012456.000|20110128012459.000|TR0|there is no chance under the sun that this 
20110128012459.000|20110128012501.000|TR0|Congress this year is going to bring about 
20110128012501.000|20110128012503.000|TR0|those kinds of cuts.  Much as I would like 
20110128012503.000|20110128012506.000|TR0|that to be the case, it's not going to 
20110128012506.000|20110128012508.000|TR0|happen.  The reason is Congress has the 
20110128012508.000|20110128012511.000|TR0|power right now to engage in virtually 
20110128012511.000|20110128012513.000|TR0|limitless deficit spending.
20110128012513.000|20110128012516.000|TR0|
20110128012516.000|20110128012518.000|TR0|Benjamin Franklin said he'll cheat without 
20110128012518.000|20110128012520.000|TR0|scruple who can without fear.  And the 
20110128012520.000|20110128012523.000|TR0|corollary to that is Congress will borrow 
20110128012523.000|20110128012525.000|TR0|indefinitely in unlimited amounts from our 
20110128012525.000|20110128012528.000|TR0|unborn grandchildren when it has the power 
20110128012528.000|20110128012530.000|TR0|to do so.  We have to take that power 
20110128012530.000|20110128012533.000|TR0|away.  And that's what I'm saying we've 
20110128012533.000|20110128012535.000|TR0|got to do.
20110128012535.000|20110128012537.000|TR0|
20110128012537.000|20110128012540.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Senator, I am not asking you 
20110128012540.000|20110128012542.000|TR0|what Congress will do, I'm asking you what 
20110128012542.000|20110128012545.000|TR0|your proposing so we can then have the 
20110128012545.000|20110128012547.000|TR0|conversation about where you think the 
20110128012547.000|20110128012550.000|TR0|cuts should come from.  That's all.       
20110128012550.000|20110128012552.000|TR0|What do you think they should come from?  
20110128012552.000|20110128012554.000|TR0|And as I said f you want to cut $500 
20110128012554.000|20110128012557.000|TR0|billion, you're not going to do it from 
20110128012557.000|20110128012559.000|TR0|certain areas where you can't.  So I'm 
20110128012559.000|20110128012602.000|TR0|just curious where you would.  That's all.
20110128012602.000|20110128012604.000|TR0|
20110128012604.000|20110128012607.000|TR0|I know time is running show, but what I'd 
20110128012607.000|20110128012609.000|TR0|love to do when you figure it out, I'm 
20110128012609.000|20110128012611.000|TR0|sure you will, is let's have you back on 
20110128012611.000|20110128012614.000|TR0|the show and then we can go area by area 
20110128012614.000|20110128012616.000|TR0|and see if we agree or not.
20110128012616.000|20110128012619.000|TR0|
20110128012619.000|20110128012621.000|TR0|LEE:  Maybe we can put up some graphs and 
20110128012621.000|20110128012624.000|TR0|talk about the graphs as well.  That'll be 
20110128012624.000|20110128012626.000|TR0|a lot of fun.
20110128012626.000|20110128012629.000|TR0|
20110128012629.000|20110128012631.000|TR0|SPITZER:  I'm with you, Senator.  We'll 
20110128012631.000|20110128012633.000|TR0|put up the graphs you want us to put up 
20110128012633.000|20110128012636.000|TR0|next time.  How's that?
20110128012636.000|20110128012638.000|TR0|
20110128012638.000|20110128012641.000|TR0|LEE:  That would be great.
20110128012641.000|20110128012643.000|TR0|
20110128012643.000|20110128012646.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.  Senator Lee, thanks 
20110128012646.000|20110128012648.000|TR0|so much for being with us.
20110128012648.000|20110128012650.000|TR0|
20110128012650.000|20110128012653.000|TR0|LEE:  Thank you.
20110128012653.000|20110128012655.000|TR0|
20110128012655.000|20110128012658.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Coming up, we'll go back to 
20110128012658.000|20110128012700.000|TR0|Cairo where angry demonstrations are 
20110128012700.000|20110128012703.000|TR0|threatening to bring down the government.  
20110128012703.000|20110128012705.000|TR0|We'll talk to our man on the ground, find 
20110128012705.000|20110128012707.000|TR0|out if the protests have reached critical 
20110128012707.000|20110128012710.000|TR0|mass.  Stay with us.

20110128012717.000|20110128012720.000|TR0|PARKER:  Turning back to the dramatic 
20110128012720.000|20110128012722.000|TR0|developments in Egypt that we told you 
20110128012722.000|20110128012724.000|TR0|about at the top of the program, things 
20110128012724.000|20110128012727.000|TR0|there are developing quickly.

20110128012729.000|20110128012732.000|TR0|SPITZER:  CNN senior international 
20110128012732.000|20110128012734.000|TR0|correspondent Ben Wedeman has lived in 
20110128012734.000|20110128012737.000|TR0|Egypt for years and for the past few days 
20110128012737.000|20110128012739.000|TR0|has covered the large and violent 
20110128012739.000|20110128012741.000|TR0|demonstrations.
20110128012741.000|20110128012744.000|TR0|
20110128012744.000|20110128012746.000|TR0|Ben, join us now, tell us the latest.

20110128012749.000|20110128012751.000|TR0|BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL 
20110128012751.000|20110128012754.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Eliot, what's interesting 
20110128012754.000|20110128012756.000|TR0|is what's happened in cyberspace.  The 
20110128012756.000|20110128012758.000|TR0|Internet in Egypt went down around 1:00 
20110128012758.000|20110128012801.000|TR0|local time, 1:00 in the morning.  And not 
20110128012801.000|20110128012803.000|TR0|just in Cairo, even people in upper Egypt, 
20110128012803.000|20110128012806.000|TR0|in the far south are saying that it's not 
20110128012806.000|20110128012808.000|TR0|working there as well.
20110128012808.000|20110128012811.000|TR0|
20110128012811.000|20110128012813.000|TR0|Mid evening, we were no longer to send or 
20110128012813.000|20110128012815.000|TR0|receive SMS or text messages as well.  It 
20110128012815.000|20110128012818.000|TR0|appears that the government is already 
20110128012818.000|20110128012820.000|TR0|starting to crack down on those methods, 
20110128012820.000|20110128012823.000|TR0|those means with which this protest 
20110128012823.000|20110128012825.000|TR0|movement has really worked on and strove 
20110128012825.000|20110128012828.000|TR0|through in organizing the protests.
20110128012828.000|20110128012830.000|TR0|
20110128012830.000|20110128012832.000|TR0|And of course, we're expecting massive 
20110128012832.000|20110128012835.000|TR0|protests Friday when people have been 
20110128012835.000|20110128012837.000|TR0|called after Friday prayers to join in 
20110128012837.000|20110128012840.000|TR0|public areas and go to the center of their 
20110128012840.000|20110128012842.000|TR0|cities to launch an even larger protest 
20110128012842.000|20110128012845.000|TR0|that what we saw on Tuesday.
20110128012845.000|20110128012847.000|TR0|
20110128012847.000|20110128012849.000|TR0|The government continues to seem to send 
20110128012849.000|20110128012852.000|TR0|and turn a deaf ear to all these protests. 
20110128012852.000|20110128012854.000|TR0| We went to a press conference where the 
20110128012854.000|20110128012857.000|TR0|head of the ruling National Democratic 
20110128012857.000|20110128012859.000|TR0|Party spoke, and he sort of brushed off 
20110128012859.000|20110128012902.000|TR0|these protests as being led by extremists 
20110128012902.000|20110128012904.000|TR0|and being out of touch with reality.
20110128012904.000|20110128012906.000|TR0|
20110128012906.000|20110128012909.000|TR0|But, in fact, the reaction of the Egyptian 
20110128012909.000|20110128012911.000|TR0|journalists at that press conference is 
20110128012911.000|20110128012914.000|TR0|that he's out of touch with reality.  One 
20110128012914.000|20110128012916.000|TR0|Egyptian journalist told me afterwards 
20110128012916.000|20110128012919.000|TR0|listening to this man is like receiving 
20110128012919.000|20110128012921.000|TR0|dispatches from a parallel universe.
20110128012921.000|20110128012923.000|TR0|
20110128012923.000|20110128012926.000|TR0|PARKER:  Ben, this is Kathleen Parker.  Do 
20110128012926.000|20110128012928.000|TR0|you feel like that the government shutting 
20110128012928.000|20110128012931.000|TR0|down this communication is going to have 
20110128012931.000|20110128012933.000|TR0|the desired effect, or is this just merely 
20110128012933.000|20110128012936.000|TR0|going to feed the fury even more?
20110128012936.000|20110128012938.000|TR0|
20110128012938.000|20110128012940.000|TR0|WEDEMAN:  Essentially all the groundwork 
20110128012940.000|20110128012943.000|TR0|has been laid for Friday's demonstrations. 
20110128012943.000|20110128012945.000|TR0| Everybody knows about it, word of mouth. 
20110128012945.000|20110128012948.000|TR0|It's everybody.  I mean there's nobody in 
20110128012948.000|20110128012950.000|TR0|this country that hasn't heard about it.  
20110128012950.000|20110128012953.000|TR0|And if they're going to demonstrate, 
20110128012953.000|20110128012955.000|TR0|they're going to demonstrate.
20110128012955.000|20110128012957.000|TR0|
20110128012957.000|20110128013000.000|TR0|So that's really not going to change it.  
20110128013000.000|20110128013002.000|TR0|But what's important is that twitter has 
20110128013002.000|20110128013005.000|TR0|been very effective in allowing Egyptians 
20110128013005.000|20110128013007.000|TR0|to know what's happening in this 
20110128013007.000|20110128013010.000|TR0|neighborhood, in this town, in this area, 
20110128013010.000|20110128013012.000|TR0|and they can sort of act accordingly.
20110128013012.000|20110128013015.000|TR0|
20110128013015.000|20110128013017.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, what is your best guess for 
20110128013017.000|20110128013019.000|TR0|what's going to happen tomorrow?
20110128013019.000|20110128013022.000|TR0|
20110128013022.000|20110128013024.000|TR0|WEDEMAN:  Nobody really is willing to 
20110128013024.000|20110128013027.000|TR0|venture a guess.  I did speak to one 
20110128013027.000|20110128013029.000|TR0|Egyptian who has been very involved in 
20110128013029.000|20110128013032.000|TR0|these protests. And he said that we can 
20110128013032.000|20110128013034.000|TR0|expect large numbers.  That just if you 
20110128013034.000|20110128013036.000|TR0|take a percentage of some of these 
20110128013036.000|20110128013039.000|TR0|Facebook groups, where one has 380,000 
20110128013039.000|20110128013041.000|TR0|people, he said 30,000 people out of that 
20110128013041.000|20110128013044.000|TR0|380,000 show out -- show up, that will be 
20110128013044.000|20110128013046.000|TR0|more than the number of protesters we saw 
20110128013046.000|20110128013049.000|TR0|on Tuesday.
20110128013049.000|20110128013051.000|TR0|
20110128013051.000|20110128013053.000|TR0|Now what the Tuesday demonstrations did 
20110128013053.000|20110128013056.000|TR0|was emboldened so many people who had 
20110128013056.000|20110128013058.000|TR0|never demonstrated before.  In fact, 
20110128013058.000|20110128013101.000|TR0|almost everybody I spoke with on Tuesday 
20110128013101.000|20110128013103.000|TR0|said this is the first time I've done it 
20110128013103.000|20110128013106.000|TR0|and they were exhilarated.  They were 
20110128013106.000|20110128013108.000|TR0|overjoyed that they could finally come out 
20110128013108.000|20110128013110.000|TR0|and express their anger publicly.  I think 
20110128013110.000|20110128013113.000|TR0|they may be developing a taste for this 
20110128013113.000|20110128013115.000|TR0|kind of protests that cutting 
20110128013115.000|20110128013118.000|TR0|communications may not make that big a 
20110128013118.000|20110128013120.000|TR0|difference.
20110128013120.000|20110128013123.000|TR0|
20110128013123.000|20110128013125.000|TR0|I can tell you the first day of the 
20110128013125.000|20110128013127.000|TR0|demonstrations the police were 
20110128013127.000|20110128013130.000|TR0|overwhelmed.  Demonstrators broke through 
20110128013130.000|20110128013132.000|TR0|police lines.  The police who were sort of 
20110128013132.000|20110128013135.000|TR0|trained by being severely beaten, I mean, 
20110128013135.000|20110128013137.000|TR0|they have some very rough boot camps for 
20110128013137.000|20110128013140.000|TR0|police here.  Without orders, they're 
20110128013140.000|20110128013142.000|TR0|paralyzed.  They didn't have orders on 
20110128013142.000|20110128013144.000|TR0|what to do if the demonstrators 
20110128013144.000|20110128013147.000|TR0|overwhelmed them.  We saw yesterday that 
20110128013147.000|20110128013149.000|TR0|the reaction was violent.  Far more police 
20110128013149.000|20110128013152.000|TR0|were put out on the street.  They used 
20110128013152.000|20110128013154.000|TR0|liberally tear gas, rubber bullets, water 
20110128013154.000|20110128013157.000|TR0|hoses, and, of course, their ubiquitous 
20110128013157.000|20110128013159.000|TR0|sticks and canes that they use on 
20110128013159.000|20110128013201.000|TR0|demonstrators.
20110128013201.000|20110128013204.000|TR0|
20110128013204.000|20110128013206.000|TR0|ELIOT SPITZER, HOST:  Of course, today, 
20110128013206.000|20110128013209.000|TR0|Ben, one of the major developments was the 
20110128013209.000|20110128013211.000|TR0|return of Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel 
20110128013211.000|20110128013214.000|TR0|Peace Prize winner.  How has that affected 
20110128013214.000|20110128013216.000|TR0|sentiment in the street and how will that 
20110128013216.000|20110128013218.000|TR0|affect tomorrow's protests?
20110128013218.000|20110128013221.000|TR0|
20110128013221.000|20110128013223.000|TR0|WEDEMAN:  He missed the demonstrations on 
20110128013223.000|20110128013226.000|TR0|Tuesday.  Coming back, many people are 
20110128013226.000|20110128013228.000|TR0|saying why is he coming here when he 
20110128013228.000|20110128013231.000|TR0|didn't participate in those critical 
20110128013231.000|20110128013233.000|TR0|moments that got this movement going? So 
20110128013233.000|20110128013235.000|TR0|some people are happy to see him, but when 
20110128013235.000|20110128013238.000|TR0|I was at the airport upon his arrival 
20110128013238.000|20110128013240.000|TR0|today, they were a lot of media, but not 
20110128013240.000|20110128013243.000|TR0|many supporters.
20110128013243.000|20110128013245.000|TR0|
20110128013245.000|20110128013248.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.  Ben Wedeman, thank 
20110128013248.000|20110128013250.000|TR0|you so much for joining us this evening 
20110128013250.000|20110128013252.000|TR0|from Cairo.  We will be checking in with 
20110128013252.000|20110128013255.000|TR0|you tomorrow no doubt.  And stay safe.
20110128013255.000|20110128013257.000|TR0|
20110128013257.000|20110128013300.000|TR0|When we come back, the financial crisis of 
20110128013300.000|20110128013302.000|TR0|2008.  The new report establishes that it 
20110128013302.000|20110128013305.000|TR0|was a disaster that did not have to 
20110128013305.000|20110128013307.000|TR0|happen.  So why did it?
20110128013307.000|20110128013309.000|TR0|
20110128013309.000|20110128013312.000|TR0|Next, two keen observers of Wall Street 
20110128013312.000|20110128013314.000|TR0|answer that question. Don't go away.
20110128013314.000|20110128013317.000|TR0|

20110128013322.000|20110128013324.000|TR0|SPITZER:  The government's report on the 
20110128013324.000|20110128013326.000|TR0|2008 financial meltdown was released 
20110128013326.000|20110128013329.000|TR0|today.  The Financial Crisis Inquiry 
20110128013329.000|20110128013331.000|TR0|Commission tells us what we already 
20110128013331.000|20110128013334.000|TR0|suspected.  The crisis could have been 
20110128013334.000|20110128013336.000|TR0|avoided. Everybody from Wall Street 
20110128013336.000|20110128013339.000|TR0|bankers to failed regulators to borrowers 
20110128013339.000|20110128013341.000|TR0|gaining the system contributed to the 
20110128013341.000|20110128013344.000|TR0|largest financial debacle since the Great 
20110128013344.000|20110128013346.000|TR0|Depression.

20110128013353.000|20110128013356.000|TR0|financial editor Gretchen Morgenson who is 
20110128013356.000|20110128013358.000|TR0|also a Pulitzer Prize winner, and Bill

20110128013401.000|20110128013403.000|TR0|the last days of Bear Stearns.
20110128013403.000|20110128013405.000|TR0|
20110128013405.000|20110128013408.000|TR0|Welcome, Gretchen and Bill.  Thanks for 
20110128013408.000|20110128013410.000|TR0|joining us.

20110128013415.000|20110128013418.000|TR0|Thank you.

20110128013420.000|20110128013422.000|TR0|GRETCHEN MORGENSON, "NEW YORK TIMES" 
20110128013422.000|20110128013425.000|TR0|EDITOR  &  COLUMNIST:  Nice to be here.
20110128013425.000|20110128013427.000|TR0|
20110128013427.000|20110128013430.000|TR0|COHAN:  Nice to be here.
20110128013430.000|20110128013432.000|TR0|
20110128013432.000|20110128013435.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right.  So Gretchen, bless 
20110128013435.000|20110128013437.000|TR0|your heart.  You read this 500-page report 
20110128013437.000|20110128013439.000|TR0|so we don't have to.
20110128013439.000|20110128013442.000|TR0|
20110128013442.000|20110128013444.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  633-page report.
20110128013444.000|20110128013447.000|TR0|
20110128013447.000|20110128013449.000|TR0|PARKER:  Six hundred thirty-three.
20110128013449.000|20110128013452.000|TR0|
20110128013452.000|20110128013454.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  I needed the Visine when I 
20110128013454.000|20110128013456.000|TR0|came in here today.
20110128013456.000|20110128013459.000|TR0|
20110128013459.000|20110128013501.000|TR0|PARKER:  I guess you did.  In 300 words or 
20110128013501.000|20110128013504.000|TR0|less, what did it say?
20110128013504.000|20110128013506.000|TR0|
20110128013506.000|20110128013509.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  Well, it really it's pretty 
20110128013509.000|20110128013511.000|TR0|scathing about the regulatory community.  
20110128013511.000|20110128013513.000|TR0|Particularly the Fed gets hit hard.  The 
20110128013513.000|20110128013516.000|TR0|SEC also.  This is not exactly news to us 
20110128013516.000|20110128013518.000|TR0|as Eliot said right at the top. But, you 
20110128013518.000|20110128013521.000|TR0|know, it's kind of chapter and verse that 
20110128013521.000|20110128013523.000|TR0|you get in the report does give you a 
20110128013523.000|20110128013526.000|TR0|little bit more than we had previous.
20110128013526.000|20110128013528.000|TR0|
20110128013528.000|20110128013530.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, they were six -- the 
20110128013530.000|20110128013533.000|TR0|majority report says one thing then you 
20110128013533.000|20110128013535.000|TR0|had Republicans dissenting, and they had 
20110128013535.000|20110128013538.000|TR0|-- they drew different conclusions.  So 
20110128013538.000|20110128013540.000|TR0|who's right?
20110128013540.000|20110128013543.000|TR0|
20110128013543.000|20110128013545.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  They really weren't different 
20110128013545.000|20110128013547.000|TR0|conclusions.  I mean, they were -- what I 
20110128013547.000|20110128013550.000|TR0|felt about the dissent, and I don't know 
20110128013550.000|20110128013552.000|TR0|if you have a view on this, Bill, but it 
20110128013552.000|20110128013555.000|TR0|was more like we want to expand the sort 
20110128013555.000|20110128013557.000|TR0|of --
20110128013557.000|20110128013600.000|TR0|
20110128013600.000|20110128013602.000|TR0|COHAN:  The blame.
20110128013602.000|20110128013604.000|TR0|
20110128013604.000|20110128013607.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  -- the blame, and the entities 
20110128013607.000|20110128013609.000|TR0|that were involved and the systems that 
20110128013609.000|20110128013612.000|TR0|were involved that really felt to me more 
20110128013612.000|20110128013614.000|TR0|like the dissent was about systems rather 
20110128013614.000|20110128013617.000|TR0|than people.
20110128013617.000|20110128013619.000|TR0|
20110128013619.000|20110128013621.000|TR0|PARKER:  But weren't they also making the 
20110128013621.000|20110128013624.000|TR0|point that it's more complicated than what 
20110128013624.000|20110128013626.000|TR0|the majority report said?
20110128013626.000|20110128013629.000|TR0|
20110128013629.000|20110128013631.000|TR0|COHAN:  Well, I think that really the way 
20110128013631.000|20110128013634.000|TR0|-- I mean, they've all dissented and 
20110128013634.000|20110128013636.000|TR0|people have said, well, it doesn't have 
20110128013636.000|20110128013638.000|TR0|credibility because there's a dissenting 
20110128013638.000|20110128013641.000|TR0|-- two dissenting voices and one positive 
20110128013641.000|20110128013643.000|TR0|voice.  But I think you need to really 
20110128013643.000|20110128013646.000|TR0|take them all together.  I think when you 
20110128013646.000|20110128013648.000|TR0|look at them all together, you get a very, 
20110128013648.000|20110128013651.000|TR0|very clear picture of responsibility here, 
20110128013651.000|20110128013653.000|TR0|which was a, this was a manmade 
20110128013653.000|20110128013655.000|TR0|occurrence.  This did not have to happen.  
20110128013655.000|20110128013658.000|TR0|That's the real -- that's the number one 
20110128013658.000|20110128013700.000|TR0|conclusion of the affirmative members of 
20110128013700.000|20110128013703.000|TR0|the committee who did not dissent.  And I 
20110128013703.000|20110128013705.000|TR0|think that's very heartening because this 
20110128013705.000|20110128013708.000|TR0|was a manmade event.  It was entirely 
20110128013708.000|20110128013710.000|TR0|preventable.  And I think that's the shame 
20110128013710.000|20110128013712.000|TR0|of this.  And then you can widen it out.
20110128013712.000|20110128013715.000|TR0|
20110128013715.000|20110128013717.000|TR0|Yes, people make mistakes.  There were all 
20110128013717.000|20110128013720.000|TR0|sorts of mistakes made from homeowners who 
20110128013720.000|20110128013722.000|TR0|borrowed money they shouldn't have had, to 
20110128013722.000|20110128013725.000|TR0|regulators who didn't enforce the rules on 
20110128013725.000|20110128013727.000|TR0|the books, to Bernanke and Paulson and 
20110128013727.000|20110128013730.000|TR0|Geithner, who did not take the steps that 
20110128013730.000|20110128013732.000|TR0|they probably could have and should have 
20110128013732.000|20110128013734.000|TR0|taken, although, in fairness to them they 
20110128013734.000|20110128013737.000|TR0|probably saw this fire hose of activity 
20110128013737.000|20110128013739.000|TR0|coming at them, and they did the best they 
20110128013739.000|20110128013742.000|TR0|could at each time.  But I think it's 
20110128013742.000|20110128013744.000|TR0|actually an incredibly detailed and 
20110128013744.000|20110128013747.000|TR0|important report.  And I hope people take 
20110128013747.000|20110128013749.000|TR0|the time to look at it because it's very, 
20110128013749.000|20110128013751.000|TR0|very heartening in that regard.
20110128013751.000|20110128013754.000|TR0|
20110128013754.000|20110128013756.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, look, it's going to be a 
20110128013756.000|20110128013759.000|TR0|classic, which means everybody will talk 
20110128013759.000|20110128013801.000|TR0|about it.  Nobody will read it because it 
20110128013801.000|20110128013804.000|TR0|is too long.  But I think the dissent is 
20110128013804.000|20110128013806.000|TR0|at a level of abstraction up here. The 
20110128013806.000|20110128013808.000|TR0|majority report is granular down here.  
20110128013808.000|20110128013811.000|TR0|They don't fundamentally disagree, but the 
20110128013811.000|20110128013813.000|TR0|dissent tries to be so abstract as to not 
20110128013813.000|20110128013816.000|TR0|place blame the way the majority report 
20110128013816.000|20110128013818.000|TR0|does.
20110128013818.000|20110128013821.000|TR0|
20110128013821.000|20110128013823.000|TR0|But I want to come back to something 
20110128013823.000|20110128013825.000|TR0|Gretchen said and begin where she began, 
20110128013825.000|20110128013828.000|TR0|which is the Fed.  Because it was the Fed, 
20110128013828.000|20110128013830.000|TR0|and this is very clear in the majority 
20110128013830.000|20110128013833.000|TR0|report as the primary regulator of the 
20110128013833.000|20110128013835.000|TR0|entire banking system that is ultimately 
20110128013835.000|20110128013838.000|TR0|responsible.  Two people there, Ben 
20110128013838.000|20110128013840.000|TR0|Bernanke, Tim Geithner and that raises the 
20110128013840.000|20110128013842.000|TR0|fundamental question not only about the 
20110128013842.000|20110128013845.000|TR0|Fed but system wide.  Are the culpable 
20110128013845.000|20110128013847.000|TR0|parties being held accountable anywhere by 
20110128013847.000|20110128013850.000|TR0|anybody?
20110128013850.000|20110128013852.000|TR0|
20110128013852.000|20110128013855.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  Don't forget Alan Greenspan.
20110128013855.000|20110128013857.000|TR0|
20110128013857.000|20110128013859.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Of course, but he's not there 
20110128013859.000|20110128013902.000|TR0|right now.
20110128013902.000|20110128013904.000|TR0|
20110128013904.000|20110128013907.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  Obviously he's not there right 
20110128013907.000|20110128013909.000|TR0|now.
20110128013909.000|20110128013912.000|TR0|
20110128013912.000|20110128013914.000|TR0|You know, one of my great frustrations has 
20110128013914.000|20110128013916.000|TR0|been throughout this crisis is that there 
20110128013916.000|20110128013919.000|TR0|are many people who were very involved who 
20110128013919.000|20110128013921.000|TR0|were either asleep at the switch or worse, 
20110128013921.000|20110128013924.000|TR0|who then sort of get promotions and get 
20110128013924.000|20110128013926.000|TR0|jobs that are even more powerful than they 
20110128013926.000|20110128013929.000|TR0|were, you know, when they were asleep on 
20110128013929.000|20110128013931.000|TR0|the switch.  And to me that's just 
20110128013931.000|20110128013933.000|TR0|confounding.  Why is that?
20110128013933.000|20110128013936.000|TR0|
20110128013936.000|20110128013938.000|TR0|PARKER:  Name names.  Which people?
20110128013938.000|20110128013941.000|TR0|
20110128013941.000|20110128013943.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  Tim Geithner.  I mean, you 
20110128013943.000|20110128013946.000|TR0|know, New York Fed.  They had a 
20110128013946.000|20110128013948.000|TR0|responsibility for Citibank.  They 
20110128013948.000|20110128013950.000|TR0|obviously had a responsibility for 
20110128013950.000|20110128013953.000|TR0|derivatives because all the Wall Street 
20110128013953.000|20110128013955.000|TR0|firms were trading derivatives like crazy 
20110128013955.000|20110128013958.000|TR0|and they were trying -- he was trying to 
20110128013958.000|20110128014000.000|TR0|worry about the back office when actually 
20110128014000.000|20110128014003.000|TR0|the real problem was just the size of the 
20110128014003.000|20110128014005.000|TR0|market and the fact that it was 
20110128014005.000|20110128014007.000|TR0|unregulated.  So, you know, I would say to 
20110128014007.000|20110128014010.000|TR0|him, certainly who is now the treasury 
20110128014010.000|20110128014012.000|TR0|secretary and Bernanke who, you know, was 
20110128014012.000|20110128014015.000|TR0|re-upped as chairman.
20110128014015.000|20110128014017.000|TR0|
20110128014017.000|20110128014020.000|TR0|COHAN:  They certainly knew.  I talked to 
20110128014020.000|20110128014022.000|TR0|Geithner in the writing and reporting of 
20110128014022.000|20110128014024.000|TR0|my book about Bear Stearns.  He absolutely 
20110128014024.000|20110128014027.000|TR0|could see what was happening.  He could 
20110128014027.000|20110128014029.000|TR0|see the bubble inflating.  He and Bernanke 
20110128014029.000|20110128014032.000|TR0|could see it.  They talked about it.  The 
20110128014032.000|20110128014034.000|TR0|question is did they do anything about it? 
20110128014034.000|20110128014037.000|TR0| And the answer is, they didn't.  We know 
20110128014037.000|20110128014039.000|TR0|they didn't.
20110128014039.000|20110128014041.000|TR0|
20110128014041.000|20110128014044.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, but what's more amazing, 
20110128014044.000|20110128014046.000|TR0|and I hate to go off on Tim one more time, 
20110128014046.000|20110128014049.000|TR0|but when he was president of the New York 
20110128014049.000|20110128014051.000|TR0|Fed and then testifying about whether or 
20110128014051.000|20110128014054.000|TR0|not he should be treasury secretary, he 
20110128014054.000|20110128014056.000|TR0|said -- this is a remarkable statement -- 
20110128014056.000|20110128014058.000|TR0|I was not a regulator.  I don't think he 
20110128014058.000|20110128014101.000|TR0|understood his regulatory purpose.  And 
20110128014101.000|20110128014103.000|TR0|Gretchen has come back to your notion of 
20110128014103.000|20110128014106.000|TR0|promotion.  We all heard about the Peter 
20110128014106.000|20110128014108.000|TR0|principle where you get promoted to the 
20110128014108.000|20110128014111.000|TR0|level of your incompetence.  I call this 
20110128014111.000|20110128014113.000|TR0|the Peter principle on steroids.  People 
20110128014113.000|20110128014116.000|TR0|were at their level of incompetence 
20110128014116.000|20110128014118.000|TR0|because that crisis erupted and that 
20110128014118.000|20110128014120.000|TR0|because they were up here, they say we're 
20110128014120.000|20110128014123.000|TR0|the only people who can deal with it.  And 
20110128014123.000|20110128014125.000|TR0|they got one upped to even more 
20110128014125.000|20110128014128.000|TR0|significant positions and that's why we 
20110128014128.000|20110128014130.000|TR0|got away with that.
20110128014130.000|20110128014133.000|TR0|
20110128014133.000|20110128014135.000|TR0|COHAN:  It looks like the argument that 
20110128014135.000|20110128014137.000|TR0|they made for Joseph Cassano, the head of 
20110128014137.000|20110128014140.000|TR0|AIG Financial Products who had to be kept 
20110128014140.000|20110128014142.000|TR0|around for a million dollars a month to, 
20110128014142.000|20110128014145.000|TR0|you know, dismantle the atomic bombs that 
20110128014145.000|20110128014147.000|TR0|he created.  And I think there was a 
20110128014147.000|20110128014150.000|TR0|feeling with Geithner and Bernanke that 
20110128014150.000|20110128014152.000|TR0|these guys are the guys who are heart 
20110128014152.000|20110128014154.000|TR0|surgeons when the patient was on the table 
20110128014154.000|20110128014157.000|TR0|and the heart was open and they needed 
20110128014157.000|20110128014159.000|TR0|these people to still be around.
20110128014159.000|20110128014202.000|TR0|
20110128014202.000|20110128014204.000|TR0|PARKER:  Gretchen, some -- there's reports 
20110128014204.000|20110128014207.000|TR0|that investigators have turned over some 
20110128014207.000|20110128014209.000|TR0|names, some financial industry names to 
20110128014209.000|20110128014211.000|TR0|the government for possible prosecution.  
20110128014211.000|20110128014214.000|TR0|Is that likely to happen?
20110128014214.000|20110128014216.000|TR0|
20110128014216.000|20110128014219.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  Well, you know, I was looking 
20110128014219.000|20110128014221.000|TR0|through the report for any indication at 
20110128014221.000|20110128014224.000|TR0|all that there might be prosecutions.  
20110128014224.000|20110128014226.000|TR0|And, of course, this is another 
20110128014226.000|20110128014228.000|TR0|frustrating element of this entire episode 
20110128014228.000|20110128014231.000|TR0|is that the prosecutions have been few and 
20110128014231.000|20110128014233.000|TR0|far between, and the ones that have come 
20110128014233.000|20110128014236.000|TR0|out have pretty much come out from Neil 
20110128014236.000|20110128014238.000|TR0|Barofsky's office. You know, the office of 
20110128014238.000|20110128014241.000|TR0|the inspector general for TARP.  You know, 
20110128014241.000|20110128014243.000|TR0|and he's not what we normally think of.  
20110128014243.000|20110128014245.000|TR0|You think of DOJ.  We think of the SEC.  
20110128014245.000|20110128014248.000|TR0|We think of, you know, the U.S. attorney, 
20110128014248.000|20110128014250.000|TR0|and yet I didn't see a whole lot in there.
20110128014250.000|20110128014253.000|TR0|
20110128014253.000|20110128014255.000|TR0|Now, there were disclosures that I thought 
20110128014255.000|20110128014258.000|TR0|were fascinating about companies that were 
20110128014258.000|20110128014300.000|TR0|misleading their investors on conference 
20110128014300.000|20110128014302.000|TR0|calls about the financial soundness of 
20110128014302.000|20110128014305.000|TR0|their operations.  I mean, that alone 
20110128014305.000|20110128014307.000|TR0|should be, you know, a case that the SEC 
20110128014307.000|20110128014310.000|TR0|can bring.
20110128014310.000|20110128014312.000|TR0|
20110128014312.000|20110128014315.000|TR0|PARKER:  Yes, you would think so.
20110128014315.000|20110128014317.000|TR0|
20110128014317.000|20110128014319.000|TR0|SPITZER:  We have written about the due 
20110128014319.000|20110128014322.000|TR0|diligence that was done by the banks.  You 
20110128014322.000|20110128014324.000|TR0|have written about it.  We've had folks on 
20110128014324.000|20110128014327.000|TR0|the show.  The due diligence that was done 
20110128014327.000|20110128014329.000|TR0|in the banks had the evidence that the 
20110128014329.000|20110128014332.000|TR0|subprime loans they were making did not 
20110128014332.000|20110128014334.000|TR0|satisfy their own underwriting standards 
20110128014334.000|20110128014336.000|TR0|and they didn't disclose this or change 
20110128014336.000|20110128014339.000|TR0|their behavior.  Why are they then not 
20110128014339.000|20110128014341.000|TR0|prosecuted for that or the rating agencies 
20110128014341.000|20110128014344.000|TR0|that had that same data?
20110128014344.000|20110128014346.000|TR0|
20110128014346.000|20110128014349.000|TR0|COHAN:  Eliot, you're a former prosecutor. 
20110128014349.000|20110128014351.000|TR0| Why?  I've asked this question over and 
20110128014351.000|20110128014353.000|TR0|over again.  The only two people that were 
20110128014353.000|20110128014356.000|TR0|indicted were the two Bear Stearns hedge 
20110128014356.000|20110128014358.000|TR0|fund managers.  They got off.
20110128014358.000|20110128014401.000|TR0|
20110128014401.000|20110128014403.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110128014403.000|20110128014406.000|TR0|
20110128014406.000|20110128014408.000|TR0|COHAN:  I thought I gave a prosecutorial 
20110128014408.000|20110128014410.000|TR0|road map in my book for how they might, 
20110128014410.000|20110128014413.000|TR0|you know, be prosecuted.  And I don't 
20110128014413.000|20110128014415.000|TR0|understand that the supposedly grand 
20110128014415.000|20110128014418.000|TR0|juries looking into the Lehman executives, 
20110128014418.000|20110128014420.000|TR0|nothing happens.  Cassano goes free.  You 
20110128014420.000|20110128014423.000|TR0|know, I would like to know why that 
20110128014423.000|20110128014425.000|TR0|happens.  I really would.
20110128014425.000|20110128014427.000|TR0|
20110128014427.000|20110128014430.000|TR0|PARKER:  Gretchen, please, I have to 
20110128014430.000|20110128014432.000|TR0|interrupt.  One second.  We have to take a 
20110128014432.000|20110128014435.000|TR0|quick break.
20110128014435.000|20110128014437.000|TR0|
20110128014437.000|20110128014440.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  OK.
20110128014440.000|20110128014442.000|TR0|
20110128014442.000|20110128014444.000|TR0|PARKER:  We'll be right back.

20110128014452.000|20110128014454.000|TR0|PARKER:  We're back with "New York Times" 
20110128014454.000|20110128014457.000|TR0|financial editor Gretchen Morgenson and 
20110128014457.000|20110128014459.000|TR0|Bill Cohan, author of "House of Cards" 
20110128014459.000|20110128014502.000|TR0|about the last days of Bear Stearns.  And 
20110128014502.000|20110128014504.000|TR0|we're discussing the government's report 
20110128014504.000|20110128014506.000|TR0|on the 2008 financial meltdown.
20110128014506.000|20110128014509.000|TR0|
20110128014509.000|20110128014511.000|TR0|Bill, this report just came out today.  
20110128014511.000|20110128014514.000|TR0|But obviously President Obama knew about 
20110128014514.000|20110128014516.000|TR0|it, knew what was in it.  Are you 
20110128014516.000|20110128014519.000|TR0|surprised he didn't mention anything about 
20110128014519.000|20110128014521.000|TR0|it in the State of the Union?
20110128014521.000|20110128014523.000|TR0|
20110128014523.000|20110128014526.000|TR0|COHAN:  I was very surprised and 
20110128014526.000|20110128014528.000|TR0|disappointed, I might add. Because the 
20110128014528.000|20110128014531.000|TR0|"New York Times" had been already 
20110128014531.000|20110128014533.000|TR0|reporting some of the details and the 
20110128014533.000|20110128014536.000|TR0|conclusions of the report and the fact 
20110128014536.000|20110128014538.000|TR0|that, you know, this was a manmade error 
20110128014538.000|20110128014540.000|TR0|and could have been prevented.  President 
20110128014540.000|20110128014543.000|TR0|Obama didn't mention it once during the 
20110128014543.000|20110128014545.000|TR0|State of the Union address. It's like he's 
20110128014545.000|20110128014548.000|TR0|whitewashing it.  It's like it never 
20110128014548.000|20110128014550.000|TR0|happened.  Instead of using it as a 
20110128014550.000|20110128014553.000|TR0|learning opportunity, a teaching moment 
20110128014553.000|20110128014555.000|TR0|where we still do need to learn from this, 
20110128014555.000|20110128014557.000|TR0|the facts and circumstances that happened 
20110128014557.000|20110128014600.000|TR0|here, he could have mentioned it.  He 
20110128014600.000|20110128014602.000|TR0|didn't have to dwell on it, but, you know, 
20110128014602.000|20110128014605.000|TR0|he didn't have to ignore it completely.  I 
20110128014605.000|20110128014607.000|TR0|was disappointed.
20110128014607.000|20110128014610.000|TR0|
20110128014610.000|20110128014612.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Look, Bill, two years after the 
20110128014612.000|20110128014614.000|TR0|worst crisis since the depression, the 
20110128014614.000|20110128014617.000|TR0|Republican majority in the House wants to 
20110128014617.000|20110128014619.000|TR0|undo Dodd- Frank.  And that begs the 
20110128014619.000|20110128014622.000|TR0|question, has anything changed, any of the 
20110128014622.000|20110128014624.000|TR0|structures, any of the people?  Gretchen, 
20110128014624.000|20110128014627.000|TR0|will this happen again because we haven't 
20110128014627.000|20110128014629.000|TR0|learned a lesson?
20110128014629.000|20110128014631.000|TR0|
20110128014631.000|20110128014634.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  I absolutely think it will 
20110128014634.000|20110128014636.000|TR0|happen again.  And it probably won't take 
20110128014636.000|20110128014639.000|TR0|too long to happen again.  That's the 
20110128014639.000|20110128014641.000|TR0|really depressing thing about this.  And 
20110128014641.000|20110128014644.000|TR0|so when you're reading this report as I 
20110128014644.000|20110128014646.000|TR0|was today, thinking in those terms, too 
20110128014646.000|20110128014648.000|TR0|big to fail, alive and well.  We have not 
20110128014648.000|20110128014651.000|TR0|learned how to cut these institutions down 
20110128014651.000|20110128014653.000|TR0|to size. The same regulatory structure 
20110128014653.000|20110128014656.000|TR0|that was in place, that was inert, asleep 
20110128014656.000|20110128014658.000|TR0|at the switch not paying attention, same 
20110128014658.000|20110128014701.000|TR0|people who were doing those things or not 
20110128014701.000|20110128014703.000|TR0|doing.
20110128014703.000|20110128014705.000|TR0|
20110128014705.000|20110128014708.000|TR0|COHAN:  Promoting.
20110128014708.000|20110128014710.000|TR0|
20110128014710.000|20110128014713.000|TR0|MORGENSON:  Promoting.  So I have 
20110128014713.000|20110128014715.000|TR0|absolutely no doubt that another episode 
20110128014715.000|20110128014718.000|TR0|like this will occur.
20110128014718.000|20110128014720.000|TR0|
20110128014720.000|20110128014722.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And in fact the incentives, the 
20110128014722.000|20110128014725.000|TR0|pay incentives and the desires of the CEOs 
20110128014725.000|20110128014727.000|TR0|and the regulatory agencies not to act 
20110128014727.000|20110128014730.000|TR0|seem to be the same to me.
20110128014730.000|20110128014732.000|TR0|
20110128014732.000|20110128014735.000|TR0|COHAN:  Eliot, you're absolutely right.  
20110128014735.000|20110128014737.000|TR0|The incentive structure on Washington has 
20110128014737.000|20110128014739.000|TR0|not changed one iota.  You know, people do 
20110128014739.000|20110128014742.000|TR0|what they're rewarded to do.  On Wall 
20110128014742.000|20110128014744.000|TR0|Street at the moment, they are 
20110128014744.000|20110128014747.000|TR0|unfortunately still rewarded to take risks 
20110128014747.000|20110128014749.000|TR0|with other people's money in order to make 
20110128014749.000|20110128014752.000|TR0|big bonuses every single year.  And until 
20110128014752.000|20110128014754.000|TR0|they're, you know, they have really have 
20110128014754.000|20110128014756.000|TR0|skin in the game like they used to when 
20110128014756.000|20110128014759.000|TR0|they were private partnerships, you're not 
20110128014759.000|20110128014801.000|TR0|going to change their behavior.  You're 
20110128014801.000|20110128014804.000|TR0|not -- people want to maximize their 
20110128014804.000|20110128014806.000|TR0|bonuses. They're very good at financial 
20110128014806.000|20110128014809.000|TR0|innovation.  They'll come up with a new 
20110128014809.000|20110128014811.000|TR0|product.  A product that we don't even 
20110128014811.000|20110128014813.000|TR0|know what it is yet, and they'll sell that 
20110128014813.000|20110128014816.000|TR0|until another bubble is inflated.  And 
20110128014816.000|20110128014818.000|TR0|Gretchen is abs right, it won't be very 
20110128014818.000|20110128014821.000|TR0|long.
20110128014821.000|20110128014823.000|TR0|
20110128014823.000|20110128014826.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know I've always said, to 
20110128014826.000|20110128014828.000|TR0|understand Wall Street you need to read 
20110128014828.000|20110128014830.000|TR0|one book which is Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of 
20110128014830.000|20110128014833.000|TR0|the Vanities" and understand three 
20110128014833.000|20110128014835.000|TR0|letters, OPM, other people's money. That 
20110128014835.000|20110128014838.000|TR0|is all this is.  Leveraging other people's 
20110128014838.000|20110128014840.000|TR0|money so you take a share off the top and 
20110128014840.000|20110128014843.000|TR0|somebody else has all the risk.  And 
20110128014843.000|20110128014845.000|TR0|that's still the game that's being played.
20110128014845.000|20110128014848.000|TR0|
20110128014848.000|20110128014850.000|TR0|COHAN:  And it's amazing to me that that 
20110128014850.000|20110128014852.000|TR0|has not changed.  Even though this is an 
20110128014852.000|20110128014855.000|TR0|incredible opportunity to change that, to 
20110128014855.000|20110128014857.000|TR0|get people to have more skin in the game, 
20110128014857.000|20110128014900.000|TR0|and nobody has demanded that.  And they 
20110128014900.000|20110128014902.000|TR0|should.  That should be what Ben Bernanke 
20110128014902.000|20110128014905.000|TR0|as the regulator is demanding now.
20110128014905.000|20110128014907.000|TR0|
20110128014907.000|20110128014909.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.  Well, he's listening 
20110128014909.000|20110128014912.000|TR0|to you tonight.  Maybe he will.
20110128014912.000|20110128014914.000|TR0|
20110128014914.000|20110128014917.000|TR0|All right.  Gretchen and Bill, thank you

20110128014956.000|20110128014958.000|TR0|Seidler is an overnight success at the age 
20110128014958.000|20110128015000.000|TR0|of 73.  It's a story that could only 
20110128015000.000|20110128015003.000|TR0|happen in Hollywood.  Seidler wrote the 
20110128015003.000|20110128015005.000|TR0|screenplay for "The King's Speech," the 
20110128015005.000|20110128015008.000|TR0|most Oscar-nominated film of the year 
20110128015008.000|20110128015010.000|TR0|garnering 12 in all.  It's an unlikely box 
20110128015010.000|20110128015013.000|TR0|office hit.  The story of how Britain's 
20110128015013.000|20110128015015.000|TR0|King George VI overcame a crippling 
20110128015015.000|20110128015017.000|TR0|stutter.  Not coincidentally, Seidler 
20110128015017.000|20110128015020.000|TR0|himself was a stutter as a child.  Let's 
20110128015020.000|20110128015022.000|TR0|take a look at a scene from the film.

20110128015108.000|20110128015111.000|TR0|I'm a king, where is my power?  Can I form

20110128015116.000|20110128015118.000|TR0|of all authority.  Why?  Because the

20110128015121.000|20110128015123.000|TR0|for them.  But I can't speak.

20110128015140.000|20110128015142.000|TR0|DAVID SEIDLER, SCREENWRITER, "THE KING'S 
20110128015142.000|20110128015145.000|TR0|SPEECH:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
20110128015145.000|20110128015147.000|TR0|
20110128015147.000|20110128015150.000|TR0|SPITZER:  This must be a feeling of just 
20110128015150.000|20110128015152.000|TR0|great, you know, overwhelming joy.  This 
20110128015152.000|20110128015155.000|TR0|was 25 years in the making.     SEIDLER:  
20110128015155.000|20110128015157.000|TR0|It's a pretty nice victory lap.  Yes, I 
20110128015157.000|20110128015159.000|TR0|keep on hoping the alarm clock isn't going 
20110128015159.000|20110128015202.000|TR0|to ring and wake me up.
20110128015202.000|20110128015204.000|TR0|
20110128015204.000|20110128015207.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, it won't.  This is 12 
20110128015207.000|20110128015209.000|TR0|nominations.  You began this endeavor 25 
20110128015209.000|20110128015212.000|TR0|years ago.  Did you see this coming when 
20110128015212.000|20110128015214.000|TR0|you had the script?  Could you just 
20110128015214.000|20110128015216.000|TR0|understand the way the public would react 
20110128015216.000|20110128015219.000|TR0|to it?
20110128015219.000|20110128015221.000|TR0|
20110128015221.000|20110128015224.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  Not for a long time because our 
20110128015224.000|20110128015226.000|TR0|aspirations were very, very modest at 
20110128015226.000|20110128015229.000|TR0|first.  It was going to be a BBC for one 
20110128015229.000|20110128015231.000|TR0|million pound, three-camera TV movie.  
20110128015231.000|20110128015234.000|TR0|There was no thought originally of 
20110128015234.000|20110128015236.000|TR0|bringing it to America.  No thought of 
20110128015236.000|20110128015238.000|TR0|being in the cinema.  So, yes, it's quite 
20110128015238.000|20110128015241.000|TR0|a sensation.
20110128015241.000|20110128015243.000|TR0|
20110128015243.000|20110128015246.000|TR0|SPITZER:  So what happened?  You were a 
20110128015246.000|20110128015248.000|TR0|stutter.  For you, was this catharsis?  
20110128015248.000|20110128015251.000|TR0|Was there some underlying motivation to 
20110128015251.000|20110128015253.000|TR0|say to the world we who have stuttered can 
20110128015253.000|20110128015255.000|TR0|nonetheless be powerful?  What led to all 
20110128015255.000|20110128015258.000|TR0|this?
20110128015258.000|20110128015300.000|TR0|
20110128015300.000|20110128015303.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  Well, I am not sure whether I 
20110128015303.000|20110128015305.000|TR0|could have done it as a younger man, 
20110128015305.000|20110128015308.000|TR0|truly.  Stuttering is a pain.  A real pain.
20110128015308.000|20110128015310.000|TR0|
20110128015310.000|20110128015312.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110128015312.000|20110128015315.000|TR0|
20110128015315.000|20110128015317.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  And it's like going to the 
20110128015317.000|20110128015320.000|TR0|dentist.  You know your tooth is aching 
20110128015320.000|20110128015322.000|TR0|and the dentist fixes it.  The last thing 
20110128015322.000|20110128015325.000|TR0|you want to do is think about how that 
20110128015325.000|20110128015327.000|TR0|toothache, you want to forget about it. 
20110128015327.000|20110128015329.000|TR0|Same as being a stutterer.  Once it's 
20110128015329.000|20110128015332.000|TR0|over, you want to put it aside. But as you 
20110128015332.000|20110128015334.000|TR0|get to my, shall we say maturity, you 
20110128015334.000|20110128015337.000|TR0|begin to look back on your life.  And I 
20110128015337.000|20110128015339.000|TR0|was able to reenter the pain and isolation 
20110128015339.000|20110128015342.000|TR0|and frustration of being a stutterer which 
20110128015342.000|20110128015344.000|TR0|was very important for the script and very 
20110128015344.000|20110128015346.000|TR0|important when speaking with Colin and 
20110128015346.000|20110128015349.000|TR0|helping him prepare himself to be a 
20110128015349.000|20110128015351.000|TR0|stutterer.
20110128015351.000|20110128015354.000|TR0|
20110128015354.000|20110128015356.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Could a non-stutterer have 
20110128015356.000|20110128015359.000|TR0|written the script?
20110128015359.000|20110128015401.000|TR0|
20110128015401.000|20110128015403.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  I don't think so.
20110128015403.000|20110128015406.000|TR0|
20110128015406.000|20110128015408.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Your view about stuttering?  Is 
20110128015408.000|20110128015411.000|TR0|it an emotionally driven disability?  How 
20110128015411.000|20110128015413.000|TR0|do you understand it now?
20110128015413.000|20110128015416.000|TR0|
20110128015416.000|20110128015418.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  I believe the root cause if you 
20110128015418.000|20110128015420.000|TR0|look at it comes down to one thing.  
20110128015420.000|20110128015423.000|TR0|Something -- some trigger mechanism says 
20110128015423.000|20110128015425.000|TR0|my voice is not being heard.  You lose 
20110128015425.000|20110128015428.000|TR0|confidence in your voice.
20110128015428.000|20110128015430.000|TR0|
20110128015430.000|20110128015433.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Now part of the reason we 
20110128015433.000|20110128015435.000|TR0|sympathize with George is, of course, the 
20110128015435.000|20110128015437.000|TR0|contrast with Edward, who is an absolute 
20110128015437.000|20110128015440.000|TR0|abomination of a person, certainly.  
20110128015440.000|20110128015442.000|TR0|That's my sense of him after watching the 
20110128015442.000|20110128015445.000|TR0|movie. Is he really that leveled?
20110128015445.000|20110128015447.000|TR0|
20110128015447.000|20110128015450.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  Yes, I think he really was.  And 
20110128015450.000|20110128015452.000|TR0|truly, we went light on him.  There were 
20110128015452.000|20110128015454.000|TR0|many other things we could have said but 
20110128015454.000|20110128015457.000|TR0|chose not to.  He was a man I believe who 
20110128015457.000|20110128015459.000|TR0|was truly selfish.  He was described by 
20110128015459.000|20110128015502.000|TR0|one of his private secretaries as a man 
20110128015502.000|20110128015504.000|TR0|who the gods gave everything to, but they 
20110128015504.000|20110128015507.000|TR0|forgot to give him a soul.
20110128015507.000|20110128015509.000|TR0|
20110128015509.000|20110128015511.000|TR0|SPITZER:  That's a great description.
20110128015511.000|20110128015514.000|TR0|
20110128015514.000|20110128015516.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  He really thought that he was a 
20110128015516.000|20110128015519.000|TR0|divine right king, which was couple of 
20110128015519.000|20110128015521.000|TR0|centuries late.  He thought that he could 
20110128015521.000|20110128015524.000|TR0|do what he wanted to do and not what the 
20110128015524.000|20110128015526.000|TR0|people needed him to do.  There's a big 
20110128015526.000|20110128015528.000|TR0|difference.
20110128015528.000|20110128015531.000|TR0|
20110128015531.000|20110128015533.000|TR0|SPITZER:  He seems mean spirited, nasty, 
20110128015533.000|20110128015536.000|TR0|pernicious.
20110128015536.000|20110128015538.000|TR0|
20110128015538.000|20110128015541.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  Yes.

20110128015543.000|20110128015545.000|TR0|SPITZER:  We actually have a clip.  Let's

20110128015701.000|20110128015703.000|TR0|sorry.  Younger brother trying to put 
20110128015703.000|20110128015706.000|TR0|older brother off the throne.  
20110128015706.000|20110128015708.000|TR0|P-positively very evil.

20110128015715.000|20110128015718.000|TR0|SPITZER:  So he mocks his younger brother 
20110128015718.000|20110128015720.000|TR0|and then walks into that party with the 
20110128015720.000|20110128015723.000|TR0|champagne for Wallace Simpson.  Really 
20110128015723.000|20110128015725.000|TR0|just heinous.  Sort of Gatsby without the 
20110128015725.000|20110128015728.000|TR0|soul.
20110128015728.000|20110128015730.000|TR0|
20110128015730.000|20110128015732.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  Yes.  Yes, indeed.  And that's 
20110128015732.000|20110128015735.000|TR0|on record.  He did tease his brother.  He 
20110128015735.000|20110128015737.000|TR0|was encouraged to by the father, who was, 
20110128015737.000|20110128015740.000|TR0|you know, quite a piece of work.
20110128015740.000|20110128015742.000|TR0|
20110128015742.000|20110128015745.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Why did this movie connect?  
20110128015745.000|20110128015747.000|TR0|Obviously has touched a nerve in a way 
20110128015747.000|20110128015749.000|TR0|that very few movies do.  What was it?
20110128015749.000|20110128015752.000|TR0|
20110128015752.000|20110128015754.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  Well, you know, first of all, 
20110128015754.000|20110128015757.000|TR0|one of the reasons, and it's the reason 
20110128015757.000|20110128015759.000|TR0|why I think a lot of young people love 
20110128015759.000|20110128015802.000|TR0|this film. They understand bullying.  They 
20110128015802.000|20110128015804.000|TR0|understand teasing.  They understand being 
20110128015804.000|20110128015806.000|TR0|marginalized.  And they understand the 
20110128015806.000|20110128015809.000|TR0|power of a supportive friendship.     
20110128015809.000|20110128015811.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110128015811.000|20110128015814.000|TR0|
20110128015814.000|20110128015816.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  The other reason that I think 
20110128015816.000|20110128015819.000|TR0|it's connected so well is not just because 
20110128015819.000|20110128015821.000|TR0|it's about monarchy.  I think that has the 
20110128015821.000|20110128015823.000|TR0|least effect on it.  It's we in America, 
20110128015823.000|20110128015826.000|TR0|this country is based on the premise that 
20110128015826.000|20110128015828.000|TR0|you can change yourself.  You can makeover 
20110128015828.000|20110128015831.000|TR0|your destiny. And this is a story about a 
20110128015831.000|20110128015833.000|TR0|man who overcomes huge obstacles and 
20110128015833.000|20110128015836.000|TR0|remakes himself.  And I think that has a 
20110128015836.000|20110128015838.000|TR0|real resonance of the American character.
20110128015838.000|20110128015840.000|TR0|
20110128015840.000|20110128015843.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Even a king.

20110128015845.000|20110128015848.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  Even a king.

20110128015850.000|20110128015853.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Who needs to go through that 
20110128015853.000|20110128015855.000|TR0|same very sort of self challenging process.
20110128015855.000|20110128015857.000|TR0|
20110128015857.000|20110128015900.000|TR0|SEIDLER:  You know, under the trappings, 
20110128015900.000|20110128015902.000|TR0|under the skin, we're all the same.
20110128015902.000|20110128015905.000|TR0|
20110128015905.000|20110128015907.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.  How true that is.
20110128015907.000|20110128015910.000|TR0|
20110128015910.000|20110128015912.000|TR0|Pleasure to have you here.  And
