20110113000007.000|20110113000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST:  Thanks Wolf and good 
20110113000009.000|20110113000012.000|TR0|evening everyone from the campus of the 
20110113000012.000|20110113000014.000|TR0|University of Arizona in Tucson.  The 
20110113000014.000|20110113000017.000|TR0|president of the United States arrived 
20110113000017.000|20110113000020.000|TR0|here just moments ago.  He will lead this 
20110113000020.000|20110113000022.000|TR0|stunned community and the nation tonight 
20110113000022.000|20110113000025.000|TR0|through a memorial service for the six 
20110113000025.000|20110113000027.000|TR0|victims killed in the weekend massacre 
20110113000027.000|20110113000030.000|TR0|here.  We will have coverage of that event 
20110113000030.000|20110113000033.000|TR0|next hour and we can show you now a live 
20110113000033.000|20110113000035.000|TR0|picture inside the McKale arena where 
20110113000035.000|20110113000038.000|TR0|people started lining up early this 
20110113000038.000|20110113000040.000|TR0|morning so they could attend that event.
20110113000040.000|20110113000043.000|TR0|
20110113000043.000|20110113000046.000|TR0|And amid all the sadness some encouraging 
20110113000046.000|20110113000048.000|TR0|news today, doctors today say the 
20110113000048.000|20110113000051.000|TR0|assassin's prime target, Congresswoman 
20110113000051.000|20110113000053.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords, is more and more 
20110113000053.000|20110113000056.000|TR0|responsive and they're encouraged about 
20110113000056.000|20110113000059.000|TR0|her prognosis.  I visited her Tucson 
20110113000059.000|20110113000101.000|TR0|office today.  There's a moving shrine 
20110113000101.000|20110113000104.000|TR0|outside where thousands of well wishers 
20110113000104.000|20110113000106.000|TR0|have come to pray, to leave notes and to 
20110113000106.000|20110113000109.000|TR0|light candles.  In a few moments you will 
20110113000109.000|20110113000112.000|TR0|hear from an aide who was standing four 
20110113000112.000|20110113000114.000|TR0|feet from congresswoman, taking 
20110113000114.000|20110113000117.000|TR0|photographs, when the shooter quietly 
20110113000117.000|20110113000119.000|TR0|walked up beside her and opened fire.

20110113000130.000|20110113000132.000|TR0|REP. GIFFORDS OFFICE:  I remember it 
20110113000132.000|20110113000135.000|TR0|because, I mean, I noticed out of the 
20110113000135.000|20110113000138.000|TR0|corner of my eye that something was moving 
20110113000138.000|20110113000140.000|TR0|and I just remember seeing his arm go up.  
20110113000140.000|20110113000143.000|TR0|I remember seeing a very small gun in his 
20110113000143.000|20110113000145.000|TR0|hand.  And I heard the first shot.  Like I 
20110113000145.000|20110113000148.000|TR0|was watching the gun as it was shot.  And 
20110113000148.000|20110113000151.000|TR0|then I just ran.
20110113000151.000|20110113000153.000|TR0|

20110113000201.000|20110113000204.000|TR0|to critics who say a campaign web posting 
20110113000204.000|20110113000206.000|TR0|putting Congresswoman's Giffords district 
20110113000206.000|20110113000209.000|TR0|in the crosshairs -- you remember that 
20110113000209.000|20110113000212.000|TR0|from last campaign probably -- could have 
20110113000212.000|20110113000214.000|TR0|encouraged the violence and in doing so 
20110113000214.000|20110113000217.000|TR0|Palin's use of language that's offensive 
20110113000217.000|20110113000219.000|TR0|to Jews incites a new controversy.

20110113000230.000|20110113000232.000|TR0|ALASKA:  Journalists and pundits should 
20110113000232.000|20110113000235.000|TR0|not manufacture a blood libel that serves 
20110113000235.000|20110113000238.000|TR0|only to incite the very hatred and 
20110113000238.000|20110113000240.000|TR0|violence that they purport to condemn. 
20110113000240.000|20110113000243.000|TR0|That is reprehensible.

20110113000245.000|20110113000248.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)      KING:  But we begin 
20110113000248.000|20110113000251.000|TR0|tonight with breaking news, new details 
20110113000251.000|20110113000253.000|TR0|into the investigation of this horrific 
20110113000253.000|20110113000256.000|TR0|shooting.  Authorities here disclosed 
20110113000256.000|20110113000258.000|TR0|today that Jared Lee Loughner was stopped 
20110113000258.000|20110113000301.000|TR0|for running a red light the morning of the 
20110113000301.000|20110113000304.000|TR0|shooting.  He was allowed to go though 
20110113000304.000|20110113000306.000|TR0|after being issued a warning because the 
20110113000306.000|20110113000309.000|TR0|officer found he had a valid license and 
20110113000309.000|20110113000311.000|TR0|he had no warrants against him.
20110113000311.000|20110113000314.000|TR0|
20110113000314.000|20110113000317.000|TR0|Also law enforcement sources tell me 
20110113000317.000|20110113000319.000|TR0|tonight they are scouring Loughner's 
20110113000319.000|20110113000322.000|TR0|erratic postings on a number of websites 
20110113000322.000|20110113000324.000|TR0|as they try, try to better understand this 
20110113000324.000|20110113000327.000|TR0|suspect and his motives.  And we learn 
20110113000327.000|20110113000330.000|TR0|today at least one piece of evidence is 
20110113000330.000|20110113000332.000|TR0|still missing, a black bag believed to 
20110113000332.000|20110113000335.000|TR0|have contained Loughner's nine millimeter 
20110113000335.000|20110113000338.000|TR0|pistol and ammunition clips when he left 
20110113000338.000|20110113000340.000|TR0|home that morning.
20110113000340.000|20110113000343.000|TR0|
20110113000343.000|20110113000345.000|TR0|And we're told he left in a hurry because 
20110113000345.000|20110113000348.000|TR0|his father started asking questions about 
20110113000348.000|20110113000351.000|TR0|the bag and about his son's odd behavior.  
20110113000351.000|20110113000353.000|TR0|A bit earlier I interviewed one of the 
20110113000353.000|20110113000356.000|TR0|lead investigators, Bureau Chief Richard 
20110113000356.000|20110113000358.000|TR0|Kastigar, of the Pima County Sheriff 
20110113000358.000|20110113000401.000|TR0|Department and he shared new details of 
20110113000401.000|20110113000404.000|TR0|the suspect's behavior that morning and 
20110113000404.000|20110113000406.000|TR0|new details about what police later found 
20110113000406.000|20110113000409.000|TR0|in Loughner's Tucson home.
20110113000409.000|20110113000411.000|TR0|
20110113000411.000|20110113000414.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
20110113000414.000|20110113000417.000|TR0|
20110113000417.000|20110113000419.000|TR0|KING:  Help me, to the degree you can, get 
20110113000419.000|20110113000422.000|TR0|a better understanding of what was taken 
20110113000422.000|20110113000424.000|TR0|from the house.  We hear about a series of 
20110113000424.000|20110113000427.000|TR0|notes in the safe, including one that 
20110113000427.000|20110113000430.000|TR0|apparently had the words "die bitch" on it.
20110113000430.000|20110113000432.000|TR0|
20110113000432.000|20110113000435.000|TR0|RICHARD KASTIGAR, BUREAU CHIEF, PIMA CO. 
20110113000435.000|20110113000437.000|TR0|SHERIFF'S DEPT.:  Right. We did go into 
20110113000437.000|20110113000440.000|TR0|his home.  And in his room, there was a 
20110113000440.000|20110113000443.000|TR0|locked box of some kind.  And within that 
20110113000443.000|20110113000445.000|TR0|box was an envelope and a piece of paper 
20110113000445.000|20110113000448.000|TR0|and hand scrolled on those piece of paper 
20110113000448.000|20110113000450.000|TR0|were a few phrases.  They were not 
20110113000450.000|20110113000453.000|TR0|conjoined necessarily.
20110113000453.000|20110113000456.000|TR0|
20110113000456.000|20110113000458.000|TR0|And there was not really a sentence 
20110113000458.000|20110113000501.000|TR0|involved here.  But the comments, die cop, 
20110113000501.000|20110113000503.000|TR0|die bitch, assassination plans have been 
20110113000503.000|20110113000506.000|TR0|made -- words to that effect.  And that 
20110113000506.000|20110113000509.000|TR0|really, that's pretty much the extent of 
20110113000509.000|20110113000511.000|TR0|those things that were written on the 
20110113000511.000|20110113000514.000|TR0|paperwork.
20110113000514.000|20110113000517.000|TR0|
20110113000517.000|20110113000519.000|TR0|KING:  Have you been able to circle a 
20110113000519.000|20110113000522.000|TR0|rough date on a calendar, say at this 
20110113000522.000|20110113000524.000|TR0|point he decided he was going to try to 
20110113000524.000|20110113000527.000|TR0|kill her?
20110113000527.000|20110113000530.000|TR0|
20110113000530.000|20110113000532.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  It would be reasonable for us 
20110113000532.000|20110113000535.000|TR0|to assume that they might be directed at 
20110113000535.000|20110113000537.000|TR0|her because one of the pieces of documents 
20110113000537.000|20110113000540.000|TR0|in there was actually the letter she wrote 
20110113000540.000|20110113000543.000|TR0|him thanking him for attending one of her 
20110113000543.000|20110113000545.000|TR0|events.  And there were some comments 
20110113000545.000|20110113000548.000|TR0|written on the back of that.
20110113000548.000|20110113000550.000|TR0|
20110113000550.000|20110113000553.000|TR0|KING:  But you don't have a sense of when 
20110113000553.000|20110113000556.000|TR0|he decided he was going to try to 
20110113000556.000|20110113000558.000|TR0|assassinate the congresswoman?
20110113000558.000|20110113000601.000|TR0|
20110113000601.000|20110113000603.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Absolutely not.  You know, 
20110113000603.000|20110113000606.000|TR0|there's been some speculation that law 
20110113000606.000|20110113000609.000|TR0|enforcement had some indicators out there 
20110113000609.000|20110113000611.000|TR0|that would cause us to take some action 
20110113000611.000|20110113000614.000|TR0|against this young man, to stop him from 
20110113000614.000|20110113000616.000|TR0|what he was doing, and that's completely 
20110113000616.000|20110113000619.000|TR0|untrue.  I couldn't underscore that more.  
20110113000619.000|20110113000622.000|TR0|     The events that led up to what 
20110113000622.000|20110113000624.000|TR0|happened Saturday, as they relate to law 
20110113000624.000|20110113000627.000|TR0|enforcement contact, really do not add up, 
20110113000627.000|20110113000629.000|TR0|in their totality, to anything that would 
20110113000629.000|20110113000632.000|TR0|cause a police officer to say this guy's 
20110113000632.000|20110113000635.000|TR0|going to go out there and shoot 20 people. 
20110113000635.000|20110113000637.000|TR0| There's nothing there.
20110113000637.000|20110113000640.000|TR0|
20110113000640.000|20110113000642.000|TR0|KING:  Prior to this event, what did you 
20110113000642.000|20110113000645.000|TR0|have, in what volume, if anything, of a 
20110113000645.000|20110113000648.000|TR0|file about Jared Lee Loughner?
20110113000648.000|20110113000650.000|TR0|
20110113000650.000|20110113000653.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  We had very little, to be 
20110113000653.000|20110113000656.000|TR0|honest with you.  There were some contacts 
20110113000656.000|20110113000658.000|TR0|with him as a young adult that deal with 
20110113000658.000|20110113000701.000|TR0|very minor occurrences or interaction with 
20110113000701.000|20110113000703.000|TR0|law enforcement.  One example is minor 
20110113000703.000|20110113000706.000|TR0|under the influence, which is a law here 
20110113000706.000|20110113000709.000|TR0|in the state of Arizona. There's a 
20110113000709.000|20110113000711.000|TR0|drinking age limit.  And if you're under 
20110113000711.000|20110113000714.000|TR0|that age, and even if you've consumed 
20110113000714.000|20110113000716.000|TR0|alcohol, it doesn't imply you're 
20110113000716.000|20110113000719.000|TR0|intoxicated or not.  It just means you're 
20110113000719.000|20110113000722.000|TR0|underage drinking.  There's a reference to 
20110113000722.000|20110113000724.000|TR0|a drug paraphernalia arrest.  All of those 
20110113000724.000|20110113000727.000|TR0|were dismissed.  And he was deferred by 
20110113000727.000|20110113000729.000|TR0|the courts to a diversionary program to 
20110113000729.000|20110113000732.000|TR0|deal with those.
20110113000732.000|20110113000735.000|TR0|
20110113000735.000|20110113000737.000|TR0|KING:  Pretty standard for --
20110113000737.000|20110113000740.000|TR0|
20110113000740.000|20110113000742.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Pretty standard for those types 
20110113000742.000|20110113000745.000|TR0|of --
20110113000745.000|20110113000748.000|TR0|
20110113000748.000|20110113000750.000|TR0|KING:  There have been some reports that 
20110113000750.000|20110113000753.000|TR0|on the morning of the shooting he ran from 
20110113000753.000|20110113000755.000|TR0|his father.  That he was having some 
20110113000755.000|20110113000758.000|TR0|conversation with his father.  He ran away 
20110113000758.000|20110113000801.000|TR0|perhaps with the backpack he then brought 
20110113000801.000|20110113000803.000|TR0|to the Safeway.  Is that true?
20110113000803.000|20110113000806.000|TR0|
20110113000806.000|20110113000808.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well, here's what transpired 
20110113000808.000|20110113000811.000|TR0|and this is what the father has told us.  
20110113000811.000|20110113000814.000|TR0|Sometime that morning, he saw his son out 
20110113000814.000|20110113000816.000|TR0|in the front part of the home with a black 
20110113000816.000|20110113000819.000|TR0|bag and some have described it as a 
20110113000819.000|20110113000821.000|TR0|backpack.  I'm not sure.  We don't have 
20110113000821.000|20110113000824.000|TR0|it, so we don't know really what it was.  
20110113000824.000|20110113000827.000|TR0|The father asked him questions to the -- 
20110113000827.000|20110113000829.000|TR0|similar to what are you doing, what is 
20110113000829.000|20110113000832.000|TR0|that.
20110113000832.000|20110113000835.000|TR0|
20110113000835.000|20110113000837.000|TR0|And Jared mumbled something back to his 
20110113000837.000|20110113000840.000|TR0|dad.  His dad said he didn't understand 
20110113000840.000|20110113000842.000|TR0|what was said.  It was unintelligible.  
20110113000842.000|20110113000845.000|TR0|And then Jared left.  The father followed. 
20110113000845.000|20110113000848.000|TR0| The father got in his vehicle and tried 
20110113000848.000|20110113000850.000|TR0|to locate his son and followed the 
20110113000850.000|20110113000853.000|TR0|direction that he went.  And he could not 
20110113000853.000|20110113000855.000|TR0|locate his son.  The father thought the 
20110113000855.000|20110113000858.000|TR0|son went into the desert some place.
20110113000858.000|20110113000901.000|TR0|
20110113000901.000|20110113000903.000|TR0|KING:  Are there any cooperation issues 
20110113000903.000|20110113000906.000|TR0|with the parents or are they fully 
20110113000906.000|20110113000908.000|TR0|cooperating?
20110113000908.000|20110113000911.000|TR0|
20110113000911.000|20110113000914.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  To my knowledge, none 
20110113000914.000|20110113000916.000|TR0|whatsoever.  You know this is a tragedy 
20110113000916.000|20110113000919.000|TR0|for them as well.  And although most of us 
20110113000919.000|20110113000921.000|TR0|really, really, really sink our sympathy 
20110113000921.000|20110113000924.000|TR0|and our heart and soul and thoughts to 
20110113000924.000|20110113000927.000|TR0|those that were killed, those families and 
20110113000927.000|20110113000929.000|TR0|the victims themselves, but in my opinion 
20110113000929.000|20110113000932.000|TR0|I think the family of the suspect really 
20110113000932.000|20110113000934.000|TR0|are victims of this as well and it's 
20110113000934.000|20110113000937.000|TR0|really, you know, bad situations, bad 
20110113000937.000|20110113000940.000|TR0|things happen to good people.  And there's 
20110113000940.000|20110113000942.000|TR0|nothing to indicate to us that these were 
20110113000942.000|20110113000945.000|TR0|bad folks.
20110113000945.000|20110113000947.000|TR0|
20110113000947.000|20110113000950.000|TR0|KING:  Do you have any doubt at this point 
20110113000950.000|20110113000953.000|TR0|in the investigation that he acted alone, 
20110113000953.000|20110113000955.000|TR0|just him?
20110113000955.000|20110113000958.000|TR0|
20110113000958.000|20110113001000.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  We are -- we are positive he 
20110113001000.000|20110113001003.000|TR0|acted alone.
20110113001003.000|20110113001006.000|TR0|
20110113001006.000|20110113001008.000|TR0|KING:  What are you missing in terms of 
20110113001008.000|20110113001011.000|TR0|the evidence you need to recover to piece 
20110113001011.000|20110113001014.000|TR0|all this together?
20110113001014.000|20110113001016.000|TR0|
20110113001016.000|20110113001019.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well, as we speak, there's an 
20110113001019.000|20110113001021.000|TR0|FBI team out at the shooting scene 
20110113001021.000|20110113001024.000|TR0|literally looking for and cataloging every 
20110113001024.000|20110113001027.000|TR0|piece of trace evidence that is minutely 
20110113001027.000|20110113001029.000|TR0|related to this case in a very broad 
20110113001029.000|20110113001032.000|TR0|environment.  But to answer your question 
20110113001032.000|20110113001034.000|TR0|perhaps more simplistically, no, there's 
20110113001034.000|20110113001037.000|TR0|no other evidence that we're aware of.
20110113001037.000|20110113001040.000|TR0|
20110113001040.000|20110113001042.000|TR0|We don't have this black bag.  We don't 
20110113001042.000|20110113001045.000|TR0|know where it went. There was certainly a 
20110113001045.000|20110113001047.000|TR0|lapse of time between the point at which 
20110113001047.000|20110113001050.000|TR0|his dad lost sight of him with it and this 
20110113001050.000|20110113001053.000|TR0|young man showed up at 10:00 in the 
20110113001053.000|20110113001055.000|TR0|morning and decided to shoot 20 people.
20110113001055.000|20110113001058.000|TR0|
20110113001058.000|20110113001100.000|TR0|KING:  So but when he walked up and opened 
20110113001100.000|20110113001103.000|TR0|fire, he was carrying the gun and the 
20110113001103.000|20110113001106.000|TR0|clips in his --
20110113001106.000|20110113001108.000|TR0|
20110113001108.000|20110113001111.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  He had them on his person.
20110113001111.000|20110113001113.000|TR0|
20110113001113.000|20110113001116.000|TR0|KING:  On his person --
20110113001116.000|20110113001119.000|TR0|
20110113001119.000|20110113001121.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Yes.
20110113001121.000|20110113001124.000|TR0|
20110113001124.000|20110113001126.000|TR0|KING:  So the bag disappeared somewhere.
20110113001126.000|20110113001129.000|TR0|
20110113001129.000|20110113001132.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  We don't know where the bag is.
20110113001132.000|20110113001134.000|TR0|
20110113001134.000|20110113001137.000|TR0|KING:  So you have notes that say, die 
20110113001137.000|20110113001139.000|TR0|cop, die bitch, the name Giffords written 
20110113001139.000|20110113001142.000|TR0|down --
20110113001142.000|20110113001145.000|TR0|
20110113001145.000|20110113001147.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  I'm not aware --
20110113001147.000|20110113001150.000|TR0|
20110113001150.000|20110113001153.000|TR0|KING:  -- my assassination --
20110113001153.000|20110113001155.000|TR0|
20110113001155.000|20110113001158.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  That's out there, but I'm not 
20110113001158.000|20110113001200.000|TR0|aware that the name Giffords is actually 
20110113001200.000|20110113001203.000|TR0|on one of those pieces of papers --
20110113001203.000|20110113001206.000|TR0|
20110113001206.000|20110113001208.000|TR0|KING:  You're not?
20110113001208.000|20110113001211.000|TR0|
20110113001211.000|20110113001213.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  That's news to me.
20110113001213.000|20110113001216.000|TR0|
20110113001216.000|20110113001219.000|TR0|KING:  Have you seen the pieces of paper?
20110113001219.000|20110113001221.000|TR0|
20110113001221.000|20110113001224.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  I'm telling you that one of the 
20110113001224.000|20110113001226.000|TR0|pieces of paper that was written on was a 
20110113001226.000|20110113001229.000|TR0|response to him from --
20110113001229.000|20110113001232.000|TR0|
20110113001232.000|20110113001234.000|TR0|KING:  From her office?
20110113001234.000|20110113001237.000|TR0|
20110113001237.000|20110113001239.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  From Congresswoman Giffords, 
20110113001239.000|20110113001242.000|TR0|from her office, thanking him for an 
20110113001242.000|20110113001245.000|TR0|attendance at an event in 2007.
20110113001245.000|20110113001247.000|TR0|
20110113001247.000|20110113001250.000|TR0|KING:  Is die bitch written on that piece 
20110113001250.000|20110113001252.000|TR0|of paper?
20110113001252.000|20110113001255.000|TR0|
20110113001255.000|20110113001258.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  I'm not going to talk about 
20110113001258.000|20110113001300.000|TR0|which piece of paper it was written on.    
20110113001300.000|20110113001303.000|TR0|   KING:  We know when he left Pima 
20110113001303.000|20110113001305.000|TR0|College, Pima Community that the school -- 
20110113001305.000|20110113001308.000|TR0|essentially he was having some behavior 
20110113001308.000|20110113001311.000|TR0|issues in the classroom and they said you 
20110113001311.000|20110113001313.000|TR0|need to get some mental health help and if 
20110113001313.000|20110113001316.000|TR0|you get that help come back and show us 
20110113001316.000|20110113001318.000|TR0|that you've received it and we'll talk 
20110113001318.000|20110113001321.000|TR0|about having you back in the class.  Have 
20110113001321.000|20110113001324.000|TR0|you -- investigators in the conversations 
20110113001324.000|20110113001326.000|TR0|with the parents or others determined 
20110113001326.000|20110113001329.000|TR0|whether he actually ever got into the 
20110113001329.000|20110113001332.000|TR0|mental health care system at all?
20110113001332.000|20110113001334.000|TR0|
20110113001334.000|20110113001337.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  I'm not aware of -- I'm aware 
20110113001337.000|20110113001339.000|TR0|certainly of Pima College's reports and 
20110113001339.000|20110113001342.000|TR0|what they suggested to this young man.  
20110113001342.000|20110113001345.000|TR0|I'm not aware of any other entity or 
20110113001345.000|20110113001347.000|TR0|family member or anybody else telling us 
20110113001347.000|20110113001350.000|TR0|that that was a necessity, was -- or 
20110113001350.000|20110113001352.000|TR0|occurred.  So to answer that more 
20110113001352.000|20110113001355.000|TR0|directly, we're not aware of a mental 
20110113001355.000|20110113001358.000|TR0|health history with him at all.
20110113001358.000|20110113001400.000|TR0|
20110113001400.000|20110113001403.000|TR0|KING:  And so when there are people out 
20110113001403.000|20110113001405.000|TR0|there who would say, so he had a problem 
20110113001405.000|20110113001408.000|TR0|at the school, he had a problem at some 
20110113001408.000|20110113001411.000|TR0|employers, this kid fell through the 
20110113001411.000|20110113001413.000|TR0|cracks and he needed help but he didn't 
20110113001413.000|20110113001416.000|TR0|get it.  Is there anything that you have 
20110113001416.000|20110113001418.000|TR0|seen where you would circle it and say 
20110113001418.000|20110113001421.000|TR0|that's where he should have been grabbed 
20110113001421.000|20110113001424.000|TR0|and forced into it?
20110113001424.000|20110113001426.000|TR0|
20110113001426.000|20110113001429.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  No and actually if I can maybe 
20110113001429.000|20110113001431.000|TR0|underscore that point. There was an 
20110113001431.000|20110113001434.000|TR0|absence of any of that to the interaction 
20110113001434.000|20110113001437.000|TR0|that he had with law enforcement.  I can 
20110113001437.000|20110113001439.000|TR0|only speak for law enforcement and our 
20110113001439.000|20110113001442.000|TR0|investigation and what we've looked at.  
20110113001442.000|20110113001444.000|TR0|There's an absence of anything alarming 
20110113001444.000|20110113001447.000|TR0|that said, uh-oh, we should be reacting to 
20110113001447.000|20110113001450.000|TR0|this and we didn't.  Whatever that law 
20110113001450.000|20110113001452.000|TR0|enforcement entity or agency is, that does 
20110113001452.000|20110113001455.000|TR0|not exist in the history that we've 
20110113001455.000|20110113001457.000|TR0|discovered so far.
20110113001457.000|20110113001500.000|TR0|
20110113001500.000|20110113001503.000|TR0|KING:  Do you have any -- is there any 
20110113001503.000|20110113001505.000|TR0|evidence that helps you get a better 
20110113001505.000|20110113001508.000|TR0|understanding of why, why he decided he 
20110113001508.000|20110113001511.000|TR0|wanted to kill the congresswoman?
20110113001511.000|20110113001513.000|TR0|
20110113001513.000|20110113001516.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  We're all asking why.  This 
20110113001516.000|20110113001518.000|TR0|whole country is asking why.  Nobody can 
20110113001518.000|20110113001521.000|TR0|put their mind around an irrational act 
20110113001521.000|20110113001524.000|TR0|and a horrific act like this that occurred 
20110113001524.000|20110113001526.000|TR0|Saturday.  There are still two victims of 
20110113001526.000|20110113001529.000|TR0|this crime that we have not been able to 
20110113001529.000|20110113001531.000|TR0|get their perspective yet simply because 
20110113001531.000|20110113001534.000|TR0|of their medical condition and one of them 
20110113001534.000|20110113001537.000|TR0|is Representative Giffords and so you know 
20110113001537.000|20110113001539.000|TR0|there's still some work to be done.
20110113001539.000|20110113001542.000|TR0|
20110113001542.000|20110113001544.000|TR0|But we've heard this phrase before but 
20110113001544.000|20110113001547.000|TR0|it's so true.  This is not a who done it.  
20110113001547.000|20110113001550.000|TR0|This is not a really difficult criminal 
20110113001550.000|20110113001552.000|TR0|case to investigate.  It's very clear all 
20110113001552.000|20110113001555.000|TR0|the perspectives, and there was dozens of 
20110113001555.000|20110113001557.000|TR0|them, of the event, that watched what 
20110113001557.000|20110113001600.000|TR0|happened, as it happened.  And although 
20110113001600.000|20110113001603.000|TR0|they might have a slightly different view, 
20110113001603.000|20110113001605.000|TR0|very -- all of those stories come together 
20110113001605.000|20110113001608.000|TR0|in a big story and they're consistent.  So 
20110113001608.000|20110113001610.000|TR0|we know what happened.  We don't know the 
20110113001610.000|20110113001613.000|TR0|why.  But we know the what.

20110113001755.000|20110113001757.000|TR0|assassin's prime target, but in Saturday's

20110113001857.000|20110113001900.000|TR0|RAJCA:  We used to refer to him in the 
20110113001900.000|20110113001902.000|TR0|office as Prince Charming. We could have 
20110113001902.000|20110113001905.000|TR0|the most angry constituent come in 
20110113001905.000|20110113001908.000|TR0|completely distraught over some kind of 
20110113001908.000|20110113001910.000|TR0|issue they've had with the federal 
20110113001910.000|20110113001913.000|TR0|government, and Gabe would go into the 
20110113001913.000|20110113001915.000|TR0|lobby and by the end they're telling 
20110113001915.000|20110113001918.000|TR0|jokes. And I mean he just had a way with 
20110113001918.000|20110113001921.000|TR0|words and he had an amazing way with 
20110113001921.000|20110113001923.000|TR0|people.  There was one intern in the

20110113001928.000|20110113001931.000|TR0|We got some, as you can imagine, some

20110113001934.000|20110113001936.000|TR0|reform votes that were taking place.  And 
20110113001936.000|20110113001939.000|TR0|one caller called and was very mean to one 
20110113001939.000|20110113001941.000|TR0|of our interns who just happened to pick 
20110113001941.000|20110113001944.000|TR0|up the phone and we referred the call to 
20110113001944.000|20110113001947.000|TR0|Gabe and in the end the caller ended up 
20110113001947.000|20110113001949.000|TR0|asking for the intern back so she could 
20110113001949.000|20110113001952.000|TR0|apologize because she felt so bad for 
20110113001952.000|20110113001954.000|TR0|being so mean to the poor intern in our

20110113002010.000|20110113002013.000|TR0|everyone.  I think he saw the good in 
20110113002013.000|20110113002015.000|TR0|everyone, and he really believed in the 
20110113002015.000|20110113002018.000|TR0|people of southern Arizona, and that they 
20110113002018.000|20110113002021.000|TR0|were a part of the United States of 
20110113002021.000|20110113002023.000|TR0|America and that this is what made up our 
20110113002023.000|20110113002026.000|TR0|great country.  I think you know he talked 
20110113002026.000|20110113002028.000|TR0|about wanting to be a part of politics.  
20110113002028.000|20110113002031.000|TR0|But he had a social work degree and so he 
20110113002031.000|20110113002034.000|TR0|really just believed that the people could 
20110113002034.000|20110113002036.000|TR0|come together and that by helping people 
20110113002036.000|20110113002039.000|TR0|we were helping better our country.
20110113002039.000|20110113002041.000|TR0|
20110113002041.000|20110113002044.000|TR0|KING:  And you mentioned he did 
20110113002044.000|20110113002047.000|TR0|constituent services, which was the whole 
20110113002047.000|20110113002049.000|TR0|goal of Saturday morning --
20110113002049.000|20110113002052.000|TR0|
20110113002052.000|20110113002054.000|TR0|RAJCA:  Definitely.
20110113002054.000|20110113002057.000|TR0|
20110113002057.000|20110113002100.000|TR0|KING:  -- to reach out --
20110113002100.000|20110113002102.000|TR0|
20110113002102.000|20110113002105.000|TR0|RAJCA:  Definitely.
20110113002105.000|20110113002107.000|TR0|
20110113002107.000|20110113002110.000|TR0|KING:  -- to people in the community.  You 
20110113002110.000|20110113002113.000|TR0|were there.  What was he doing that 
20110113002113.000|20110113002115.000|TR0|morning?
20110113002115.000|20110113002118.000|TR0|
20110113002118.000|20110113002120.000|TR0|RAJCA:  He had asked me to help set up and 
20110113002120.000|20110113002123.000|TR0|then I also did photography that day and 
20110113002123.000|20110113002126.000|TR0|he arrived first, of course, with all of 
20110113002126.000|20110113002128.000|TR0|our supplies.  And I arrived shortly after 
20110113002128.000|20110113002131.000|TR0|and so did Pam Simon (ph), another one of 
20110113002131.000|20110113002133.000|TR0|our staff members who was injured that day 
20110113002133.000|20110113002136.000|TR0|and we just started setting up.  And you 
20110113002136.000|20110113002139.000|TR0|know we kind of joked around.  He's 
20110113002139.000|20110113002141.000|TR0|getting married next April and -- or a 
20110113002141.000|20110113002144.000|TR0|year from April and we were joking around 
20110113002144.000|20110113002147.000|TR0|and I keep bugging him because I'm already 
20110113002147.000|20110113002149.000|TR0|married and I love weddings and so I kept 
20110113002149.000|20110113002152.000|TR0|bugging him, like you got to set the date, 
20110113002152.000|20110113002154.000|TR0|you got to set date, and he kept assuring 
20110113002154.000|20110113002157.000|TR0|me that it was coming and --
20110113002157.000|20110113002200.000|TR0|
20110113002200.000|20110113002202.000|TR0|KING:  And so laughing and joking and 
20110113002202.000|20110113002205.000|TR0|playing around like you always do.
20110113002205.000|20110113002207.000|TR0|
20110113002207.000|20110113002210.000|TR0|RAJCA:  Uh-huh, yes, yes --
20110113002210.000|20110113002213.000|TR0|
20110113002213.000|20110113002215.000|TR0|KING:  And then what?
20110113002215.000|20110113002218.000|TR0|
20110113002218.000|20110113002220.000|TR0|RAJCA:  And then at 10:00 the 
20110113002220.000|20110113002223.000|TR0|congresswoman arrived and our district 
20110113002223.000|20110113002226.000|TR0|director, Ron Barber (ph) and separately 
20110113002226.000|20110113002228.000|TR0|-- they drove separately that day and -- 
20110113002228.000|20110113002231.000|TR0|but they both arrived at 10:00 and the 
20110113002231.000|20110113002233.000|TR0|congresswoman hugged me and then started 
20110113002233.000|20110113002236.000|TR0|talking to the constituents and then got 
20110113002236.000|20110113002239.000|TR0|in her position, which is always in front 
20110113002239.000|20110113002241.000|TR0|of the two flags and started speaking with 
20110113002241.000|20110113002244.000|TR0|constituents.
20110113002244.000|20110113002246.000|TR0|
20110113002246.000|20110113002249.000|TR0|KING:  And where was Gabe and did he 
20110113002249.000|20110113002252.000|TR0|encounter Loughner there?
20110113002252.000|20110113002254.000|TR0|
20110113002254.000|20110113002257.000|TR0|RAJCA:  I don't believe so because the 
20110113002257.000|20110113002259.000|TR0|congresswoman was speaking with 
20110113002259.000|20110113002302.000|TR0|constituents.  She spoke with one 
20110113002302.000|20110113002305.000|TR0|gentleman who -- and I took her picture 
20110113002305.000|20110113002307.000|TR0|with him and then I was right in front of 
20110113002307.000|20110113002310.000|TR0|her taking photos that day with 
20110113002310.000|20110113002312.000|TR0|constituents and then she was speaking to 
20110113002312.000|20110113002315.000|TR0|a couple when it happened.  And I kind of 
20110113002315.000|20110113002318.000|TR0|remember where everyone was placed that 
20110113002318.000|20110113002320.000|TR0|day.
20110113002320.000|20110113002323.000|TR0|
20110113002323.000|20110113002326.000|TR0|And Gabe was further down the line.  He 
20110113002326.000|20110113002328.000|TR0|was -- and I found out yesterday after 
20110113002328.000|20110113002331.000|TR0|speaking with a couple that he was 
20110113002331.000|20110113002333.000|TR0|actually talking to a couple further down 
20110113002333.000|20110113002336.000|TR0|the line.  So I think -- and just assuming 
20110113002336.000|20110113002339.000|TR0|his back was turned and then I heard from 
20110113002339.000|20110113002341.000|TR0|Danielle that when someone shouted gun, 
20110113002341.000|20110113002344.000|TR0|Danielle and Gabe both turned and started 
20110113002344.000|20110113002346.000|TR0|running towards the gun.  Danielle was 
20110113002346.000|20110113002349.000|TR0|able to make it to the congresswoman but 
20110113002349.000|20110113002352.000|TR0|Gabe obviously wasn't.       KING:  
20110113002352.000|20110113002354.000|TR0|Running towards the gun though, coming to 
20110113002354.000|20110113002357.000|TR0|protect the congresswoman, you think?
20110113002357.000|20110113002359.000|TR0|
20110113002359.000|20110113002402.000|TR0|RAJCA:  I think so because -- I wouldn't 
20110113002402.000|20110113002405.000|TR0|put it past Gabe to do something like 
20110113002405.000|20110113002407.000|TR0|that, but because -- I know that he was 
20110113002407.000|20110113002410.000|TR0|further down the line because he wasn't in 
20110113002410.000|20110113002412.000|TR0|my line of sight when I was shooting 
20110113002412.000|20110113002415.000|TR0|photos and from where I saw his body 
20110113002415.000|20110113002418.000|TR0|afterwards, it was right by the 
20110113002418.000|20110113002420.000|TR0|congresswoman.
20110113002420.000|20110113002423.000|TR0|
20110113002423.000|20110113002425.000|TR0|KING:  When did you first see the shooter?
20110113002425.000|20110113002428.000|TR0|
20110113002428.000|20110113002431.000|TR0|RAJCA:  He actually approached our table 
20110113002431.000|20110113002433.000|TR0|before -- before the shooting.  I was 
20110113002433.000|20110113002436.000|TR0|standing -- there was a table separating 
20110113002436.000|20110113002438.000|TR0|me from the congresswoman and I was taking 
20110113002438.000|20110113002441.000|TR0|pictures across the table.  But behind the 
20110113002441.000|20110113002444.000|TR0|table, next to the congresswoman was 
20110113002444.000|20110113002446.000|TR0|another intern who was kind of greeting 
20110113002446.000|20110113002449.000|TR0|people as they came up to find out what 
20110113002449.000|20110113002451.000|TR0|was going on.  And we had some materials 
20110113002451.000|20110113002454.000|TR0|on the table and so the intern standing 
20110113002454.000|20110113002457.000|TR0|there, the shooter came up to the table 
20110113002457.000|20110113002459.000|TR0|and said is Giffords here?
20110113002459.000|20110113002502.000|TR0|
20110113002502.000|20110113002505.000|TR0|And Alex, our intern, said yes and pointed 
20110113002505.000|20110113002507.000|TR0|to the line and said you have to wait in 
20110113002507.000|20110113002510.000|TR0|line and he started to say thank you for 
20110113002510.000|20110113002512.000|TR0|coming and the man started walking away 
20110113002512.000|20110113002515.000|TR0|and I was like -- and I was that was kind 
20110113002515.000|20110113002518.000|TR0|of rude, but I mean we've seen a lot of 
20110113002518.000|20110113002520.000|TR0|different people so he walked away and got 
20110113002520.000|20110113002523.000|TR0|in line.  And then a few minutes passed.  
20110113002523.000|20110113002525.000|TR0|And I didn't see him come behind me, but 
20110113002525.000|20110113002528.000|TR0|he stood right next to me and raised his 
20110113002528.000|20110113002531.000|TR0|arm and pointed the gun at the 
20110113002531.000|20110113002533.000|TR0|congresswoman.  And I heard the first shot 
20110113002533.000|20110113002536.000|TR0|and then I ran to the left.
20110113002536.000|20110113002538.000|TR0|
20110113002538.000|20110113002541.000|TR0|KING:  So he was as close to you as I am 
20110113002541.000|20110113002544.000|TR0|to you?
20110113002544.000|20110113002546.000|TR0|
20110113002546.000|20110113002549.000|TR0|RAJCA:  Yes, he was right here, yes.
20110113002549.000|20110113002551.000|TR0|
20110113002551.000|20110113002554.000|TR0|KING:  What do you remember?
20110113002554.000|20110113002557.000|TR0|
20110113002557.000|20110113002559.000|TR0|RAJCA:  I just remember -- I remember it 
20110113002559.000|20110113002602.000|TR0|because, I mean, I noticed out of the 
20110113002602.000|20110113002604.000|TR0|corner of my eye that something was moving 
20110113002604.000|20110113002607.000|TR0|and I just remember seeing his arm go up.  
20110113002607.000|20110113002610.000|TR0|I remember seeing a very small gun in his 
20110113002610.000|20110113002612.000|TR0|hand.  And I heard the first shot like I 
20110113002612.000|20110113002615.000|TR0|was watching the gun as it was shot.  And 
20110113002615.000|20110113002617.000|TR0|then I just ran.  I ran to my left and he 
20110113002617.000|20110113002620.000|TR0|didn't shoot after me.  And I ran and hid 
20110113002620.000|20110113002623.000|TR0|behind my car which was really close.  
20110113002623.000|20110113002625.000|TR0|Jumped in my car and found my phone and 
20110113002625.000|20110113002628.000|TR0|called 911 and then I saw that they had -- 
20110113002628.000|20110113002630.000|TR0|the person on the 911 call had asked me is 
20110113002630.000|20110113002633.000|TR0|he contained and I looked and I saw that, 
20110113002633.000|20110113002636.000|TR0|in fact, some people had tackled him, yes.
20110113002636.000|20110113002638.000|TR0|
20110113002638.000|20110113002641.000|TR0|KING:  Were you taking photos right up 
20110113002641.000|20110113002644.000|TR0|until the shot?
20110113002644.000|20110113002646.000|TR0|
20110113002646.000|20110113002649.000|TR0|RAJCA:  Yes, I had taken a few of the 
20110113002649.000|20110113002651.000|TR0|congresswoman with the first gentleman, 
20110113002651.000|20110113002654.000|TR0|who was a veteran and then the couple I'd 
20110113002654.000|20110113002657.000|TR0|just taken some candid photos of her and 
20110113002657.000|20110113002659.000|TR0|them --
20110113002659.000|20110113002702.000|TR0|
20110113002702.000|20110113002704.000|TR0|KING:  I'm guessing the police took all 
20110113002704.000|20110113002707.000|TR0|that.
20110113002707.000|20110113002710.000|TR0|
20110113002710.000|20110113002712.000|TR0|RAJCA:  Yes.
20110113002712.000|20110113002715.000|TR0|
20110113002715.000|20110113002717.000|TR0|KING:  Is Giffords here -- is that all you 
20110113002717.000|20110113002720.000|TR0|heard him say when he walked up to the 
20110113002720.000|20110113002723.000|TR0|table the first time?
20110113002723.000|20110113002725.000|TR0|
20110113002725.000|20110113002728.000|TR0|RAJCA:  Yes.
20110113002728.000|20110113002730.000|TR0|
20110113002730.000|20110113002733.000|TR0|KING:  Didn't hear anything else from him 
20110113002733.000|20110113002736.000|TR0|there?
20110113002736.000|20110113002738.000|TR0|
20110113002738.000|20110113002741.000|TR0|RAJCA:  No, he didn't say anything else 
20110113002741.000|20110113002743.000|TR0|and he didn't say anything when he came up 
20110113002743.000|20110113002746.000|TR0|to shoot, no.
20110113002746.000|20110113002749.000|TR0|
20110113002749.000|20110113002751.000|TR0|KING:  Just walked up and --
20110113002751.000|20110113002754.000|TR0|
20110113002754.000|20110113002756.000|TR0|RAJCA:  And raised his arm.
20110113002756.000|20110113002759.000|TR0|
20110113002759.000|20110113002802.000|TR0|KING:  You're getting all choked up now 
20110113002802.000|20110113002804.000|TR0|but you're remarkably put together for 
20110113002804.000|20110113002807.000|TR0|somebody who was standing right there, who 
20110113002807.000|20110113002809.000|TR0|lost your friend.  How are you -- how have 
20110113002809.000|20110113002812.000|TR0|you dealt with the last four or five days?
20110113002812.000|20110113002815.000|TR0|
20110113002815.000|20110113002817.000|TR0|RAJCA:  I think just knowing, you know, 
20110113002817.000|20110113002820.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords and Gabe Zimmerman 
20110113002820.000|20110113002823.000|TR0|would have both wanted to keep the office 
20110113002823.000|20110113002825.000|TR0|open. They'd want to take, you know, what 
20110113002825.000|20110113002828.000|TR0|the constituents and what the community 
20110113002828.000|20110113002830.000|TR0|has to say about them.  And they'd want us 
20110113002830.000|20110113002833.000|TR0|to keep the office open.  We're a very 
20110113002833.000|20110113002836.000|TR0|close family.
20110113002836.000|20110113002838.000|TR0|
20110113002838.000|20110113002841.000|TR0|Our office here is very small.  We're only 
20110113002841.000|20110113002843.000|TR0|10 people in the office.  And I used to 
20110113002843.000|20110113002846.000|TR0|work in an office of, you know, 60 people, 
20110113002846.000|20110113002849.000|TR0|and I was close with some people there, 
20110113002849.000|20110113002851.000|TR0|but here it's really -- I used to joke 
20110113002851.000|20110113002854.000|TR0|that I can't believe people here, you 
20110113002854.000|20110113002856.000|TR0|know, we all want to hang out with each 
20110113002856.000|20110113002859.000|TR0|other after work because we just like each 
20110113002859.000|20110113002902.000|TR0|other so much and we know each other's 
20110113002902.000|20110113002904.000|TR0|families.  We're really close.

20110113002912.000|20110113002915.000|TR0|KING:  A remarkable young woman.  It was 
20110113002915.000|20110113002917.000|TR0|chilling to hear her account -- just a 
20110113002917.000|20110113002920.000|TR0|remarkable, remarkable young woman.  We 
20110113002920.000|20110113002922.000|TR0|should tell you that as we wait for the 
20110113002922.000|20110113002925.000|TR0|memorial service tonight in the auditorium 
20110113002925.000|20110113002928.000|TR0|behind me, the president of the United

20110113002930.000|20110113002933.000|TR0|family members of the six people who were 
20110113002933.000|20110113002935.000|TR0|killed on Saturday, inside that building.  
20110113002935.000|20110113002938.000|TR0|With him, Senator John McCain and Senator 
20110113002938.000|20110113002941.000|TR0|Jon Kyl of Arizona, as well as other 
20110113002941.000|20110113002943.000|TR0|members of the administration, the 
20110113002943.000|20110113002946.000|TR0|president meeting with families of the 
20110113002946.000|20110113002948.000|TR0|fallen, the memorial service next hour.

20110113002951.000|20110113002954.000|TR0|When we come back, this is a day for solid 
20110113002954.000|20110113002956.000|TR0|tribute.  However, there also is political 
20110113002956.000|20110113002959.000|TR0|controversy as Sarah Palin responds to her 
20110113002959.000|20110113003002.000|TR0|critics and sparks a new uproar.

20110113003009.000|20110113003012.000|TR0|KING:  Tonight is a night of tribute and 
20110113003012.000|20110113003015.000|TR0|reflection.  This is the program "Together 
20110113003015.000|20110113003017.000|TR0|We Thrive Tucson" (ph) is the title of the 
20110113003017.000|20110113003020.000|TR0|program for the memorial service tonight.  
20110113003020.000|20110113003022.000|TR0|But there's also new political 
20110113003022.000|20110113003025.000|TR0|controversy.  Sarah Palin chose today to 
20110113003025.000|20110113003028.000|TR0|respond to critics who suggests this image 
20110113003028.000|20110113003030.000|TR0|from last year's campaign, Congresswoman 
20110113003030.000|20110113003033.000|TR0|Giffords' district right here, is among 
20110113003033.000|20110113003035.000|TR0|the 20 in the rifle crosshairs could have 
20110113003035.000|20110113003038.000|TR0|in some way encouraged the shooter.  In a 
20110113003038.000|20110113003041.000|TR0|video posted on her Facebook page, the 
20110113003041.000|20110113003043.000|TR0|former Alaska governor condemned efforts 
20110113003043.000|20110113003046.000|TR0|to connect statements by her or others to 
20110113003046.000|20110113003048.000|TR0|last weekend's shootings.

20110113003056.000|20110113003059.000|TR0|PALIN:  But especially within hours of a 
20110113003059.000|20110113003101.000|TR0|tragedy unfolding journalists and pundits 
20110113003101.000|20110113003104.000|TR0|should not manufacture a blood libel that 
20110113003104.000|20110113003107.000|TR0|serves only to incite the very hatred and 
20110113003107.000|20110113003109.000|TR0|violence that they purport to condemn.  
20110113003109.000|20110113003112.000|TR0|That is reprehensible.

20110113003120.000|20110113003122.000|TR0|KING:  Well, tonight there's a new 
20110113003122.000|20110113003125.000|TR0|controversy over Palin's use of the term 
20110113003125.000|20110113003127.000|TR0|"blood libel".  It refers to a century's 
20110113003127.000|20110113003130.000|TR0|old myth that Jews killed Christian 
20110113003130.000|20110113003133.000|TR0|children and drank their blood and has 
20110113003133.000|20110113003135.000|TR0|been invoked throughout history as a 
20110113003135.000|20110113003138.000|TR0|pretext for violence against Jews.  A 
20110113003138.000|20110113003141.000|TR0|statement today from the Anti-Defamation 
20110113003141.000|20110113003143.000|TR0|League says even though it's inappropriate 
20110113003143.000|20110113003146.000|TR0|to blame Sarah Palin and others for the 
20110113003146.000|20110113003148.000|TR0|Tucson tragedy, quote, "we wish that Palin 
20110113003148.000|20110113003151.000|TR0|had used another phrase, instead of one so 
20110113003151.000|20110113003154.000|TR0|fraught with pain in Jewish history."

20110113003156.000|20110113003159.000|TR0|With us tonight to discuss this from New 
20110113003159.000|20110113003201.000|TR0|Orleans Democratic strategist and CNN 
20110113003201.000|20110113003204.000|TR0|political contributor James Carville, and 
20110113003204.000|20110113003207.000|TR0|in Atlanta, CNN contributor Erick 
20110113003207.000|20110113003209.000|TR0|Erickson, editor-in-chief of the 
20110113003209.000|20110113003212.000|TR0|conservative blog RedState.com.  Erick, 
20110113003212.000|20110113003214.000|TR0|let me ask you first, Sarah Palin 
20110113003214.000|20110113003217.000|TR0|obviously wanted to respond to her 
20110113003217.000|20110113003220.000|TR0|critics.  There are some asking not only 
20110113003220.000|20110113003222.000|TR0|did she use -- why did she use that term, 
20110113003222.000|20110113003225.000|TR0|"blood libel", but why did she do it today 
20110113003225.000|20110113003227.000|TR0|on a day when the president and others are 
20110113003227.000|20110113003230.000|TR0|gathering for this memorial service?

20110113003233.000|20110113003235.000|TR0|ERICK ERICKSON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  You know 
20110113003235.000|20110113003238.000|TR0|for a week, we've had people blame Sarah 
20110113003238.000|20110113003240.000|TR0|Palin for this death.  Not Jared Loughner, 
20110113003240.000|20110113003243.000|TR0|but Sarah Palin for this tragedy.  For a 
20110113003243.000|20110113003246.000|TR0|week, they've attacked her for saying 
20110113003246.000|20110113003248.000|TR0|nothing about the tragedy.  So today she 
20110113003248.000|20110113003251.000|TR0|says something and they're attacking her 
20110113003251.000|20110113003253.000|TR0|again for the use of "blood libel".
20110113003253.000|20110113003256.000|TR0|
20110113003256.000|20110113003259.000|TR0|When they start attacking Frank Rich from 
20110113003259.000|20110113003301.000|TR0|"The New York Times", Andrew Sullivan from 
20110113003301.000|20110113003304.000|TR0|"The Atlantic", The Associated Press, "The 
20110113003304.000|20110113003306.000|TR0|Boston Globe", CBS News and others who in 
20110113003306.000|20110113003309.000|TR0|the past two years have used that phrase 
20110113003309.000|20110113003312.000|TR0|and other meanings, then I'll probably 
20110113003312.000|20110113003314.000|TR0|take them seriously. This is akin to 
20110113003314.000|20110113003317.000|TR0|attacking James and me for using the word 
20110113003317.000|20110113003320.000|TR0|trinity when we make our gumbo with our 
20110113003320.000|20110113003322.000|TR0|celery, onions and bell pepper.
20110113003322.000|20110113003325.000|TR0|
20110113003325.000|20110113003327.000|TR0|KING:  James, what do you make of this?  
20110113003327.000|20110113003330.000|TR0|Governor Palin has a point in the sense

20110113003333.000|20110113003335.000|TR0|during the campaign.  The images they use, 
20110113003335.000|20110113003338.000|TR0|but for some who said you know she is 
20110113003338.000|20110113003340.000|TR0|responsible, that is over the line, right?

20110113003343.000|20110113003346.000|TR0|JAMES CARVILLE, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: 
20110113003346.000|20110113003348.000|TR0| Of course it's over the line.  Sarah 
20110113003348.000|20110113003351.000|TR0|Palin never lived this guy would have done 
20110113003351.000|20110113003353.000|TR0|that. Having said that, the targets, thing 
20110113003353.000|20110113003356.000|TR0|that she put out when you saw it after 
20110113003356.000|20110113003359.000|TR0|that you just kind of flinch.  I wish her 
20110113003359.000|20110113003401.000|TR0|well.  I hope she's the Republican nominee 
20110113003401.000|20110113003404.000|TR0|so I don't want her damaged.  But and you 
20110113003404.000|20110113003406.000|TR0|know "blood libel" was all over the right 
20110113003406.000|20110113003409.000|TR0|wing before that.
20110113003409.000|20110113003412.000|TR0|
20110113003412.000|20110113003414.000|TR0|Some of the speechwriters probably picked 
20110113003414.000|20110113003417.000|TR0|it up from "The Wall Street Journal" or 
20110113003417.000|20110113003419.000|TR0|from Andrew Breitbart or any number of 
20110113003419.000|20110113003422.000|TR0|places.  Pat Buchanan thought it was a 
20110113003422.000|20110113003425.000|TR0|nifty term, so I don't think she knew what 
20110113003425.000|20110113003427.000|TR0|she was saying.  She's always one -- 
20110113003427.000|20110113003430.000|TR0|always gives her great leeway. And anytime 
20110113003430.000|20110113003432.000|TR0|she would invoke the defense of stupidity, 
20110113003432.000|20110113003435.000|TR0|we would believe that instantly.
20110113003435.000|20110113003438.000|TR0|
20110113003438.000|20110113003440.000|TR0|So I don't think she meant anything 
20110113003440.000|20110113003443.000|TR0|anti-Semitic by it.  And I don't think 
20110113003443.000|20110113003445.000|TR0|that she had anything to do with it.  I've 
20110113003445.000|20110113003448.000|TR0|said on this program (INAUDIBLE) CNN 
20110113003448.000|20110113003451.000|TR0|there's anything to link this thing to 
20110113003451.000|20110113003453.000|TR0|politics except evidence.  There's no 
20110113003453.000|20110113003456.000|TR0|evidence that links -- this guy is just 
20110113003456.000|20110113003459.000|TR0|nutty.  He would have been nutty if it had 
20110113003459.000|20110113003501.000|TR0|never been for cable TV or talk radio or 
20110113003501.000|20110113003504.000|TR0|anything else.

20110113003535.000|20110113003538.000|TR0|ERICKSON:  There's a report out on the 
20110113003538.000|20110113003540.000|TR0|wires this evening that's coming over from 
20110113003540.000|20110113003543.000|TR0|ABC News that she's having to up the 
20110113003543.000|20110113003545.000|TR0|amount of security around her this week.  
20110113003545.000|20110113003548.000|TR0|I have no doubt that there are crazy 
20110113003548.000|20110113003551.000|TR0|people out there who unlike Jared Loughner 
20110113003551.000|20110113003553.000|TR0|are persuaded by politics and probably do 
20110113003553.000|20110113003556.000|TR0|want to do her harm.  And I'm really 
20110113003556.000|20110113003558.000|TR0|wondering about the people who have this 
20110113003558.000|20110113003601.000|TR0|week been blaming Sarah Palin for this.  
20110113003601.000|20110113003604.000|TR0|Are they going to take blame if something 
20110113003604.000|20110113003606.000|TR0|were to happen to her?  I would hope not 
20110113003606.000|20110113003609.000|TR0|because I wouldn't think they'd be 
20110113003609.000|20110113003611.000|TR0|responsible.  But it seems like the 
20110113003611.000|20110113003614.000|TR0|ridiculousness of the blame game this week 
20110113003614.000|20110113003617.000|TR0|has gone to absurd proportions on this, 
20110113003617.000|20110113003619.000|TR0|when we have six people dead, including a 
20110113003619.000|20110113003622.000|TR0|nine- year-old girl, and people seem much 
20110113003622.000|20110113003624.000|TR0|more interested in talk about the blame 
20110113003624.000|20110113003627.000|TR0|than remembering and honoring the victims.

20110113003640.000|20110113003643.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  That's right.  Politics had 
20110113003643.000|20110113003645.000|TR0|nothing to do with this, this is a nutty 
20110113003645.000|20110113003648.000|TR0|guy.

20110113003651.000|20110113003653.000|TR0|KING:  Let me ask you, James, as someone 
20110113003653.000|20110113003656.000|TR0|who has advised presidents, what is it 
20110113003656.000|20110113003658.000|TR0|that you would like to hear from our 
20110113003658.000|20110113003701.000|TR0|president next hour at this memorial 
20110113003701.000|20110113003704.000|TR0|service?
20110113003704.000|20110113003706.000|TR0|
20110113003706.000|20110113003709.000|TR0|CARVILLE: Well, I mean, to talk about the 
20110113003709.000|20110113003711.000|TR0|people who lost their lives there and to 
20110113003711.000|20110113003714.000|TR0|talk about Gabrielle Giffords who has 
20110113003714.000|20110113003717.000|TR0|apparently going to live.  I don't know, I 
20110113003717.000|20110113003719.000|TR0|hope the prognosis sounds good.  One hopes 
20110113003719.000|20110113003722.000|TR0|for that.
20110113003722.000|20110113003724.000|TR0|
20110113003724.000|20110113003727.000|TR0|Actually, I'll say something.  I feel 
20110113003727.000|20110113003730.000|TR0|sorry for this guy's parents.  These 
20110113003730.000|20110113003732.000|TR0|people, you know, it must be a horrible 
20110113003732.000|20110113003735.000|TR0|thing, you know, all the way around.  And 
20110113003735.000|20110113003737.000|TR0|I think, you know, this was different in 
20110113003737.000|20110113003740.000|TR0|Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma City was clearly 
20110113003740.000|20110113003743.000|TR0|-- this guy had a political agenda.  This 
20110113003743.000|20110113003745.000|TR0|is just a person that just -- an awful 
20110113003745.000|20110113003748.000|TR0|tragedy.  And my heart goes out to all of 
20110113003748.000|20110113003750.000|TR0|the people who were killed and the family 
20110113003750.000|20110113003753.000|TR0|of the people who were killed and injured 
20110113003753.000|20110113003756.000|TR0|in this.  I think the president can strike 
20110113003756.000|20110113003758.000|TR0|that note.
20110113003758.000|20110113003801.000|TR0|
20110113003801.000|20110113003803.000|TR0|I just don't think this is much about 
20110113003803.000|20110113003806.000|TR0|politics.  Maybe we need to get something 
20110113003806.000|20110113003809.000|TR0|in our system, mental health system, where 
20110113003809.000|20110113003811.000|TR0|somebody could have gotten to this guy 
20110113003811.000|20110113003814.000|TR0|earlier.  That's a legitimate sort of 
20110113003814.000|20110113003817.000|TR0|thing to discuss.

20110113003824.000|20110113003827.000|TR0|agreeing on that point.  This night, at

20110113003843.000|20110113003845.000|TR0|here, we've tried to reach people in this

20110113003903.000|20110113003906.000|TR0|from a small town into a city of more than 
20110113003906.000|20110113003909.000|TR0|a half million people.  We went yesterday 
20110113003909.000|20110113003911.000|TR0|to the landmark Hotel Congress, there, had 
20110113003911.000|20110113003914.000|TR0|a fabulous conversation with some local 
20110113003914.000|20110113003916.000|TR0|residents about what this means.  So we 
20110113003916.000|20110113003919.000|TR0|went back this morning and we found the 
20110113003919.000|20110113003922.000|TR0|mayor sitting there.  We also found two 
20110113003922.000|20110113003924.000|TR0|people we had never met before.  And in 
20110113003924.000|20110113003927.000|TR0|conversations with them we find out one 
20110113003927.000|20110113003929.000|TR0|volunteered in the Giffords campaign.  One 
20110113003929.000|20110113003932.000|TR0|knew Gabe Zimmerman, one of her staffer 
20110113003932.000|20110113003935.000|TR0|who was killed, went to high school with 
20110113003935.000|20110113003937.000|TR0|him.  We sat down with the mayor and those 
20110113003937.000|20110113003940.000|TR0|two residents this morning to ask them 
20110113003940.000|20110113003942.000|TR0|what tonight meant, what they wanted to 
20110113003942.000|20110113003945.000|TR0|hear from the president of the United

20110113004019.000|20110113004022.000|TR0|us in the healing process.  I know he 
20110113004022.000|20110113004024.000|TR0|knows that Tucson is a great community.  
20110113004024.000|20110113004027.000|TR0|One of the things that today is all about, 
20110113004027.000|20110113004029.000|TR0|is the healing process, praying for those 
20110113004029.000|20110113004032.000|TR0|that are still in the healing process, 
20110113004032.000|20110113004035.000|TR0|remembering those that have lost their 
20110113004035.000|20110113004037.000|TR0|lives.  But it's also making the 
20110113004037.000|20110113004040.000|TR0|transition to tomorrow and getting back to 
20110113004040.000|20110113004042.000|TR0|as normal a life as we can.
20110113004042.000|20110113004045.000|TR0|
20110113004045.000|20110113004048.000|TR0|KING:  As normal a life as we can.  Define 
20110113004048.000|20110113004050.000|TR0|that.  How has life in this city changed 
20110113004050.000|20110113004053.000|TR0|because of this?  And can the president 
20110113004053.000|20110113004055.000|TR0|help in some way?
20110113004055.000|20110113004058.000|TR0|
20110113004058.000|20110113004101.000|TR0|DAGMAR CUSHING, TUCSON RESIDENT:  Well, 
20110113004101.000|20110113004103.000|TR0|I'm sure he can.  Life in the city's 
20110113004103.000|20110113004106.000|TR0|always been sort of neighborly, I would 
20110113004106.000|20110113004108.000|TR0|say.  Although it's a pretty big city and 
20110113004108.000|20110113004111.000|TR0|it's grown a lot.  But there's still sort 
20110113004111.000|20110113004114.000|TR0|of the neighborly feeling, small town 
20110113004114.000|20110113004116.000|TR0|feeling.  And people are coming together.  
20110113004116.000|20110113004119.000|TR0|I think it shook everyone up.  It's really 
20110113004119.000|20110113004121.000|TR0|meaningful that the president is coming.
20110113004121.000|20110113004124.000|TR0|
20110113004124.000|20110113004127.000|TR0|IAN PHILABAUM, TUCSON RESIDENT:  We've 
20110113004127.000|20110113004129.000|TR0|always been a neighborly community, as big 
20110113004129.000|20110113004132.000|TR0|as we have grown to be, and we seem to 
20110113004132.000|20110113004135.000|TR0|have lost a little bit of that in recent 
20110113004135.000|20110113004137.000|TR0|years.  I think it's time that we actually 
20110113004137.000|20110113004140.000|TR0|come together and reflect, as individuals, 
20110113004140.000|20110113004142.000|TR0|a families, as community, as a city, on 
20110113004142.000|20110113004145.000|TR0|how we can get back to that point where 
20110113004145.000|20110113004148.000|TR0|we'd like to see ourselves.
20110113004148.000|20110113004150.000|TR0|
20110113004150.000|20110113004153.000|TR0|KING:  The sheriff here has been 
20110113004153.000|20110113004155.000|TR0|criticized for coming right out of the box 
20110113004155.000|20110113004158.000|TR0|and saying vitriolic politics could have 
20110113004158.000|20110113004201.000|TR0|contributed to this environment.  Do you 
20110113004201.000|20110113004203.000|TR0|believe that?
20110113004203.000|20110113004206.000|TR0|
20110113004206.000|20110113004208.000|TR0|WALKUP:  I am still in the process of 
20110113004208.000|20110113004211.000|TR0|getting some of our people out of the 
20110113004211.000|20110113004214.000|TR0|hospital.  I think that debate will go on 
20110113004214.000|20110113004216.000|TR0|for quite sometime, but not until we get 
20110113004216.000|20110113004219.000|TR0|everybody out of the hospital.  That we 
20110113004219.000|20110113004221.000|TR0|know Congresswoman Giffords is going to 
20110113004221.000|20110113004224.000|TR0|make it, and now we're very confident that 
20110113004224.000|20110113004227.000|TR0|she is going to make it and she gets into 
20110113004227.000|20110113004229.000|TR0|the healing process.  But that debate is 
20110113004229.000|20110113004232.000|TR0|something I'm not going to participate on. 
20110113004232.000|20110113004234.000|TR0| Until I'm sure all of my people are out 
20110113004234.000|20110113004237.000|TR0|of the hospital.  That's what I'm focusing 
20110113004237.000|20110113004240.000|TR0|on.
20110113004240.000|20110113004242.000|TR0|
20110113004242.000|20110113004245.000|TR0|CUSHING:  I 100 percent agree with it.  I 
20110113004245.000|20110113004247.000|TR0|was very proud of our sheriff.  He spoke 
20110113004247.000|20110113004250.000|TR0|from the heart.  And I send him a thank 
20110113004250.000|20110113004253.000|TR0|you note. I think it's -- I've seen that 
20110113004253.000|20110113004255.000|TR0|happen over the years.  No one can say for 
20110113004255.000|20110113004258.000|TR0|sure whether it contributed or not.  But 
20110113004258.000|20110113004300.000|TR0|that's my gut feeling also.  I agree with 
20110113004300.000|20110113004303.000|TR0|him.
20110113004303.000|20110113004306.000|TR0|
20110113004306.000|20110113004308.000|TR0|PHILABAUM:  This is a conversation that is 
20110113004308.000|20110113004311.000|TR0|obviously of the utmost importance right 
20110113004311.000|20110113004314.000|TR0|now.  During this healing process, as we 
20110113004314.000|20110113004316.000|TR0|move forward, if we actually want to be 
20110113004316.000|20110113004319.000|TR0|and continue to be a functional civilized 
20110113004319.000|20110113004321.000|TR0|society.  And certain conversations have 
20110113004321.000|20110113004324.000|TR0|become just inflammatory to a point where 
20110113004324.000|20110113004327.000|TR0|you could understand where 
20110113004327.000|20110113004329.000|TR0|misinterpretations can lead to just 
20110113004329.000|20110113004332.000|TR0|confrontational points, that can be this 
20110113004332.000|20110113004334.000|TR0|violent and ugly.
20110113004334.000|20110113004337.000|TR0|
20110113004337.000|20110113004340.000|TR0|KING:  Do you have particular 
20110113004340.000|20110113004342.000|TR0|conversations in mind when you say certain 
20110113004342.000|20110113004345.000|TR0|conversations?
20110113004345.000|20110113004347.000|TR0|
20110113004347.000|20110113004350.000|TR0|PHILABAUM:  No, I don't really want to 
20110113004350.000|20110113004353.000|TR0|nitpick.  I don't want to lead to that 
20110113004353.000|20110113004355.000|TR0|further conversation that could -- that 
20110113004355.000|20110113004358.000|TR0|could be more ugliness.  I just would like 
20110113004358.000|20110113004400.000|TR0|to focus more -- and this falls on myself, 
20110113004400.000|20110113004403.000|TR0|too.  I'm guilty just as-I think we all 
20110113004403.000|20110113004406.000|TR0|are, in having these inflammatory, 
20110113004406.000|20110113004408.000|TR0|negative conversations, focusing on really 
20110113004408.000|20110113004411.000|TR0|what could be a step backwards instead of 
20110113004411.000|20110113004413.000|TR0|a step forward.  And I think it is time to 
20110113004413.000|20110113004416.000|TR0|focus on that step forward.
20110113004416.000|20110113004419.000|TR0|
20110113004419.000|20110113004421.000|TR0|KING:  One of the people involved in this 
20110113004421.000|20110113004424.000|TR0|debate is Sarah Palin. Because this 
20110113004424.000|20110113004426.000|TR0|district was mentioned in one of her Web 
20110113004426.000|20110113004429.000|TR0|postings.  She did a Web posting this 
20110113004429.000|20110113004432.000|TR0|morning where she said those who are 
20110113004432.000|20110113004434.000|TR0|somehow trying to connect her to this are 
20110113004434.000|20110113004437.000|TR0|guilty of blood libel, and that is 
20110113004437.000|20110113004439.000|TR0|reprehensible conduct.  Is she right?
20110113004439.000|20110113004442.000|TR0|
20110113004442.000|20110113004445.000|TR0|CUSHING:  Are you asking me?
20110113004445.000|20110113004447.000|TR0|
20110113004447.000|20110113004450.000|TR0|KING:  Yes.
20110113004450.000|20110113004453.000|TR0|
20110113004453.000|20110113004455.000|TR0|CUSHING:  Well, I think the word "blood 
20110113004455.000|20110113004458.000|TR0|libel" is a good example right there of, 
20110113004458.000|20110113004500.000|TR0|you know, why use a word like that, in a 
20110113004500.000|20110113004503.000|TR0|situation that we have right now?  It's 
20110113004503.000|20110113004506.000|TR0|not a conciliatory word.  What went on 
20110113004506.000|20110113004508.000|TR0|before, who knows.  But I do have a 
20110113004508.000|20110113004511.000|TR0|background in mental health.  And I do 
20110113004511.000|20110113004513.000|TR0|know that people who are unbalanced 
20110113004513.000|20110113004516.000|TR0|sometimes get influenced by very strong 
20110113004516.000|20110113004519.000|TR0|language, very strong things.  So I don't 
20110113004519.000|20110113004521.000|TR0|think that's a good word.

20110113004550.000|20110113004552.000|TR0|other VIPs in the room.  Inside, former

20110113004658.000|20110113004700.000|TR0|earlier with family members of the fallen. 
20110113004700.000|20110113004703.000|TR0| Before that, he was at the hospital where 
20110113004703.000|20110113004705.000|TR0|he visited Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110113004705.000|20110113004708.000|TR0|Giffords.  She is still in intensive care, 
20110113004708.000|20110113004711.000|TR0|obviously.  Her brain injuries, though, 
20110113004711.000|20110113004713.000|TR0|her doctors are more and more optimistic.
20110113004713.000|20110113004716.000|TR0|
20110113004716.000|20110113004718.000|TR0|The president also spoke to several of the 
20110113004718.000|20110113004721.000|TR0|other victims; the wounded, who are at the 
20110113004721.000|20110113004724.000|TR0|hospital recovering.  It is a moment of 
20110113004724.000|20110113004726.000|TR0|tribute and reflection.  Sadness, a bit of 
20110113004726.000|20110113004729.000|TR0|celebration in this community today at the 
20110113004729.000|20110113004731.000|TR0|unity of recent days.  On that point I 
20110113004731.000|20110113004734.000|TR0|want to bring into the conversation or 
20110113004734.000|20110113004737.000|TR0|National Political Correspondent Jessica

20110113004739.000|20110113004742.000|TR0|
20110113004742.000|20110113004744.000|TR0|It has been remarkable, as we have been 
20110113004744.000|20110113004747.000|TR0|here.  People are sad. They are still 
20110113004747.000|20110113004750.000|TR0|stunned.  I met with an eyewitness today 
20110113004750.000|20110113004752.000|TR0|who was right there when the congresswoman 
20110113004752.000|20110113004755.000|TR0|was shot.  She's still in shock clearly. 
20110113004755.000|20110113004757.000|TR0|And yet she comes to work because she says 
20110113004757.000|20110113004800.000|TR0|the congresswoman would have wanted her to 
20110113004800.000|20110113004803.000|TR0|be there for the constituents.  She will 
20110113004803.000|20110113004805.000|TR0|be here tonight to honor her friend Gabe 
20110113004805.000|20110113004808.000|TR0|Zimmerman, among those who was gunned 
20110113004808.000|20110113004811.000|TR0|down.  It is a remarkable moment.

20110113004813.000|20110113004816.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN NAT'L. POLITICAL 
20110113004816.000|20110113004818.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  It really is.
20110113004818.000|20110113004821.000|TR0|
20110113004821.000|20110113004824.000|TR0|You know, I've talked to a lot of people 
20110113004824.000|20110113004826.000|TR0|who have shown up today. They started 
20110113004826.000|20110113004829.000|TR0|lining up at 5:30 in the morning.  The one 
20110113004829.000|20110113004831.000|TR0|thing that struck me so much is how many 
20110113004831.000|20110113004834.000|TR0|people are coming with little kids. Kids 
20110113004834.000|20110113004837.000|TR0|who they say have asked questions since 
20110113004837.000|20110113004839.000|TR0|this happened, trying to understand it, 
20110113004839.000|20110113004842.000|TR0|especially because a nine-year-old girl 
20110113004842.000|20110113004844.000|TR0|was involved. The parents are saying 
20110113004844.000|20110113004847.000|TR0|they've watched all the horrifying stuff 
20110113004847.000|20110113004850.000|TR0|and they wanted to bring the kids for a 
20110113004850.000|20110113004852.000|TR0|moment of healing, and to hear the 
20110113004852.000|20110113004855.000|TR0|president.  And they're really -- I'm 
20110113004855.000|20110113004857.000|TR0|touched that the president has come.  It's 
20110113004857.000|20110113004900.000|TR0|sort of like, well, of course -- they're 
20110113004900.000|20110113004903.000|TR0|so touched and pleased.  And really feel 
20110113004903.000|20110113004905.000|TR0|that this is a moment-I know it sounds 
20110113004905.000|20110113004908.000|TR0|corny-but for some kind of closure for 
20110113004908.000|20110113004910.000|TR0|them, a little.
20110113004910.000|20110113004913.000|TR0|
20110113004913.000|20110113004916.000|TR0|KING:  It's interesting because this is a 
20110113004916.000|20110113004918.000|TR0|city now, Tucson, of more than half a 
20110113004918.000|20110113004921.000|TR0|million people.  The university is the 
20110113004921.000|20110113004923.000|TR0|biggest thing in town.  It used to be a 
20110113004923.000|20110113004926.000|TR0|much smaller town.  Yet you walk into 
20110113004926.000|20110113004929.000|TR0|places and people say, I met the 
20110113004929.000|20110113004931.000|TR0|congresswoman so many times.  I knew the 
20110113004931.000|20110113004934.000|TR0|judge. I knew Gabe Zimmerman, the guy who 
20110113004934.000|20110113004936.000|TR0|will be honored tonight, the 30-year-old 
20110113004936.000|20110113004939.000|TR0|staffer.  Ran into a guy who said, I went 
20110113004939.000|20110113004942.000|TR0|to high school with him.  It has a small 
20110113004942.000|20110113004944.000|TR0|town feel, which I think is one of the 
20110113004944.000|20110113004947.000|TR0|reasons people are, A, so touched by it 
20110113004947.000|20110113004950.000|TR0|and, B, have come together.
20110113004950.000|20110113004952.000|TR0|
20110113004952.000|20110113004955.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Yes, it is a very big little 
20110113004955.000|20110113004957.000|TR0|town, little city.  They truly -- 
20110113004957.000|20110113005000.000|TR0|everybody says, I was one of Gabby's 
20110113005000.000|20110113005003.000|TR0|closest friends, am one of her closest 
20110113005003.000|20110113005005.000|TR0|friends.  I can't tell you how many have 
20110113005005.000|20110113005008.000|TR0|told me that. And also say-you know, some 
20110113005008.000|20110113005010.000|TR0|people come up to me and say, I want you 
20110113005010.000|20110113005013.000|TR0|to know Tucson's a really nice place.  And 
20110113005013.000|20110113005016.000|TR0|they feel awful that the whole world is 
20110113005016.000|20110113005018.000|TR0|looking at this for this tragedy.  And 
20110113005018.000|20110113005021.000|TR0|they want to show everybody how wonderful 
20110113005021.000|20110113005023.000|TR0|the town can be.  And they're hoping for 
20110113005023.000|20110113005026.000|TR0|that tonight.

20110113005336.000|20110113005339.000|TR0|
20110113005339.000|20110113005341.000|TR0|Gloria, this is a major challenge for 
20110113005341.000|20110113005344.000|TR0|President Obama tonight. As well to try to 
20110113005344.000|20110113005347.000|TR0|heal the nation and to give comfort to the 
20110113005347.000|20110113005349.000|TR0|victims.
20110113005349.000|20110113005352.000|TR0|
20110113005352.000|20110113005354.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  
20110113005354.000|20110113005357.000|TR0|Sometimes presidents need to become 
20110113005357.000|20110113005400.000|TR0|national pastors.  And I think this is one 
20110113005400.000|20110113005402.000|TR0|of those moments.  And the president has 
20110113005402.000|20110113005405.000|TR0|to rise above the occasion and give us 
20110113005405.000|20110113005407.000|TR0|hope and talk about unity.  I bet he'll 
20110113005407.000|20110113005410.000|TR0|talk about the individual heroes in this 
20110113005410.000|20110113005413.000|TR0|event, and he may also -- and I hope he 
20110113005413.000|20110113005415.000|TR0|does -- talk about the dignity of public 
20110113005415.000|20110113005418.000|TR0|service.  When he talks about the 
20110113005418.000|20110113005420.000|TR0|congresswoman, and her staff, and what 
20110113005420.000|20110113005423.000|TR0|they were out there doing that day in that 
20110113005423.000|20110113005426.000|TR0|park lot, talking to constituents, which 
20110113005426.000|20110113005428.000|TR0|is the most important part of her job.
20110113005428.000|20110113005431.000|TR0|
20110113005431.000|20110113005433.000|TR0|BLITZER:  You used to write speeches for 
20110113005433.000|20110113005436.000|TR0|presidents.  This is a difficult speech 
20110113005436.000|20110113005439.000|TR0|for the president.  I'm sure, since he's 
20110113005439.000|20110113005441.000|TR0|coming from the hospital where he's met 
20110113005441.000|20110113005444.000|TR0|with some of the victims, some of the 
20110113005444.000|20110113005447.000|TR0|survivors and his families, he will be 
20110113005447.000|20110113005449.000|TR0|moved by what he saw.
20110113005449.000|20110113005452.000|TR0|
20110113005452.000|20110113005454.000|TR0|MICHAEL GERSON, FMR. PRESIDENTIAL 
20110113005454.000|20110113005457.000|TR0|SPEECHWRITER:  It's a difficult, emotional 
20110113005457.000|20110113005500.000|TR0|speech.  I mean it is going to be 
20110113005500.000|20110113005502.000|TR0|difficult for any public figure who has 
20110113005502.000|20110113005505.000|TR0|girls himself, to talk about Christina 
20110113005505.000|20110113005507.000|TR0|Green in this circumstance.
20110113005507.000|20110113005510.000|TR0|
20110113005510.000|20110113005513.000|TR0|BLITZER:  She's the nine-year-old who was 
20110113005513.000|20110113005515.000|TR0|killed.
20110113005515.000|20110113005518.000|TR0|
20110113005518.000|20110113005520.000|TR0|GERSON:  And I think it's a difficult 
20110113005520.000|20110113005523.000|TR0|emotional moment.  The president has to 
20110113005523.000|20110113005526.000|TR0|summarize the grief of the country.  Speak 
20110113005526.000|20110113005528.000|TR0|for the whole nation.  And then to speak 
20110113005528.000|20110113005531.000|TR0|about some kind of hope and meaning beyond 
20110113005531.000|20110113005533.000|TR0|that grief, to give it some context for a 
20110113005533.000|20110113005536.000|TR0|senseless act; that's a difficult 
20110113005536.000|20110113005539.000|TR0|challenge.  It's one I think the president 
20110113005539.000|20110113005541.000|TR0|is up to.
20110113005541.000|20110113005544.000|TR0|
20110113005544.000|20110113005546.000|TR0|BLITZER:  You do?  What about you, David 
20110113005546.000|20110113005549.000|TR0|Gergen, is the president up to this moment 
20110113005549.000|20110113005552.000|TR0|tonight?
20110113005552.000|20110113005554.000|TR0|
20110113005554.000|20110113005557.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  
20110113005557.000|20110113005559.000|TR0|I think so, yes. I do. He proved during 
20110113005559.000|20110113005602.000|TR0|the campaign, especially in his speech in 
20110113005602.000|20110113005605.000|TR0|Philadelphia, that at moments when the 
20110113005605.000|20110113005607.000|TR0|nation really does want someone to speak 
20110113005607.000|20110113005610.000|TR0|to our inner thoughts, our inner souls, 
20110113005610.000|20110113005612.000|TR0|that he can -- he's capable of doing that.
20110113005612.000|20110113005615.000|TR0|
20110113005615.000|20110113005618.000|TR0|I must say he's had trouble sometimes as 
20110113005618.000|20110113005620.000|TR0|president, emotionally connecting with the 
20110113005620.000|20110113005623.000|TR0|American people.  That will be one test of 
20110113005623.000|20110113005626.000|TR0|this speech tonight.  I think the 
20110113005626.000|20110113005628.000|TR0|difficulty here, Wolf -- there are a lot 
20110113005628.000|20110113005631.000|TR0|of ritual sort of things that will be said 
20110113005631.000|20110113005633.000|TR0|in this, that almost speak for themselves. 
20110113005633.000|20110113005636.000|TR0| The difficulty is how do you find 
20110113005636.000|20110113005639.000|TR0|something that's a poetry that captures 
20110113005639.000|20110113005641.000|TR0|the voice of the people, the fears of 
20110113005641.000|20110113005644.000|TR0|people, the hopes of people, as Gloria and 
20110113005644.000|20110113005646.000|TR0|Michael were saying?  That's what 
20110113005646.000|20110113005649.000|TR0|distinguishes a truly remarkable speech 
20110113005649.000|20110113005652.000|TR0|from one that's more pedestrian.  That's 
20110113005652.000|20110113005654.000|TR0|the real challenge.
20110113005654.000|20110113005657.000|TR0|
20110113005657.000|20110113005659.000|TR0|BLITZER:  The presidential historian 
20110113005659.000|20110113005702.000|TR0|Douglas Brinkley is joining us, as well.
20110113005702.000|20110113005705.000|TR0|
20110113005705.000|20110113005707.000|TR0|Give us some perspective on this night, 
20110113005707.000|20110113005710.000|TR0|Doug.
20110113005710.000|20110113005712.000|TR0|
20110113005712.000|20110113005715.000|TR0|DOUG BRINKLEY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  
20110113005715.000|20110113005718.000|TR0|Well, you know, Tucson now is one of these 
20110113005718.000|20110113005720.000|TR0|places people will talk about in history, 
20110113005720.000|20110113005723.000|TR0|like a Selma, or Birmingham, in the 1960s. 
20110113005723.000|20110113005725.000|TR0| It seems like a war zone spot. If you go 
20110113005725.000|20110113005728.000|TR0|to Selma or Birmingham today, they coped 
20110113005728.000|20110113005731.000|TR0|with that past. They have museums and 
20110113005731.000|20110113005733.000|TR0|memorials.  This is the beginning of that 
20110113005733.000|20110113005736.000|TR0|healing for the community of Tucson.
20110113005736.000|20110113005738.000|TR0|
20110113005738.000|20110113005741.000|TR0|It's very significant President Obama is 
20110113005741.000|20110113005744.000|TR0|coming, hugging people, talking to people, 
20110113005744.000|20110113005746.000|TR0|making it know that he feels the pain of 
20110113005746.000|20110113005749.000|TR0|the community and the entire nation.  As a 
20110113005749.000|20110113005751.000|TR0|speech point of view, I think Bill Clinton 
20110113005751.000|20110113005754.000|TR0|did such an incredible job at Oklahoma 
20110113005754.000|20110113005757.000|TR0|City back in 1995, when he really brought 
20110113005757.000|20110113005759.000|TR0|the country together with that particular 
20110113005759.000|20110113005802.000|TR0|speech after that heinous terrorist act.
20110113005802.000|20110113005804.000|TR0|
20110113005804.000|20110113005807.000|TR0|So you're going to have a bit of, I think, 
20110113005807.000|20110113005810.000|TR0|that coming here.  But a tone beyond the 
20110113005810.000|20110113005812.000|TR0|obvious memorial aspects, Wolf, I think 
20110113005812.000|20110113005815.000|TR0|the president has to have the new 
20110113005815.000|20110113005818.000|TR0|civility.  We need to have a civility back 
20110113005818.000|20110113005820.000|TR0|in public life.  It will be interesting to 
20110113005820.000|20110113005823.000|TR0|see how he puts that strain into the 
20110113005823.000|20110113005825.000|TR0|speech.  Also, you don't want to seem too 
20110113005825.000|20110113005828.000|TR0|scripted. He needs to speak from the 
20110113005828.000|20110113005831.000|TR0|heart, not a teleprompter.
20110113005831.000|20110113005833.000|TR0|
20110113005833.000|20110113005836.000|TR0|BLITZER:  It's important to note that 
20110113005836.000|20110113005838.000|TR0|everyone has now been asked to be seated.  
20110113005838.000|20110113005841.000|TR0|It looks like they're getting ready to 
20110113005841.000|20110113005844.000|TR0|begin, momentarily.  There will be a full 
20110113005844.000|20110113005846.000|TR0|agenda before the president speaks. There 
20110113005846.000|20110113005849.000|TR0|will be other speakers as well.
20110113005849.000|20110113005851.000|TR0|
20110113005851.000|20110113005854.000|TR0|Gloria, this has been a very carefully 
20110113005854.000|20110113005857.000|TR0|planned one-hour memorial service for 
20110113005857.000|20110113005859.000|TR0|these victims.
20110113005859.000|20110113005902.000|TR0|
20110113005902.000|20110113005904.000|TR0|BORGER:  Yes, it is.  There are quite a 
20110113005904.000|20110113005907.000|TR0|few people who are scheduled to speak, 
20110113005907.000|20110113005910.000|TR0|Wolf.  Including the Homeland Security 
20110113005910.000|20110113005912.000|TR0|Secretary Janet Napolitano, who used to be 
20110113005912.000|20110113005915.000|TR0|the governor of Arizona and also the U.S. 
20110113005915.000|20110113005917.000|TR0|Attorney General Eric Holder, all before 
20110113005917.000|20110113005920.000|TR0|President Obama.
20110113005920.000|20110113005923.000|TR0|
20110113005923.000|20110113005925.000|TR0|Mike and I were talking earlier that this 
20110113005925.000|20110113005928.000|TR0|seems like quite a long list of people to 
20110113005928.000|20110113005930.000|TR0|speak.
20110113005930.000|20110113005933.000|TR0|
20110113005933.000|20110113005936.000|TR0|GERSON:  This may be a mistake.  I mean 
20110113005936.000|20110113005938.000|TR0|the president should be the featured 
20110113005938.000|20110113005941.000|TR0|speaker tonight --
20110113005941.000|20110113005943.000|TR0|
20110113005943.000|20110113005944.000|TR0|
