20110113050007.000|20110113050009.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110113050009.000|20110113050012.000|TR0|STATES:  Our hearts are broken, and yet 
20110113050012.000|20110113050015.000|TR0|our hearts also have reason for fullness.
20110113050015.000|20110113050018.000|TR0|
20110113050018.000|20110113050021.000|TR0|Our hearts are full of hope and thanks for 
20110113050021.000|20110113050024.000|TR0|the 13 Americans who survived the 
20110113050024.000|20110113050026.000|TR0|shooting, including the congresswoman many 
20110113050026.000|20110113050029.000|TR0|of them went to see on Saturday.  I have 
20110113050029.000|20110113050032.000|TR0|just come from the University Medical 
20110113050032.000|20110113050035.000|TR0|Center, just a mile from here, where our 
20110113050035.000|20110113050038.000|TR0|friend Gabby courageously fights to 
20110113050038.000|20110113050041.000|TR0|recover even as we speak.
20110113050041.000|20110113050043.000|TR0|
20110113050043.000|20110113050046.000|TR0|And I want to tell you -- her husband, 
20110113050046.000|20110113050049.000|TR0|Mark, is here, and he allows me to share 
20110113050049.000|20110113050052.000|TR0|this with you.  Right after we went to 
20110113050052.000|20110113050055.000|TR0|visit, a few minutes after we left her 
20110113050055.000|20110113050058.000|TR0|room and some of her colleagues from 
20110113050058.000|20110113050100.000|TR0|Congress were in the room, Gabby opened 
20110113050100.000|20110113050103.000|TR0|her eyes for the first time.
20110113050103.000|20110113050106.000|TR0|

20110113050109.000|20110113050112.000|TR0|
20110113050112.000|20110113050115.000|TR0|Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.
20110113050115.000|20110113050117.000|TR0|
20110113050117.000|20110113050120.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)

20110113050123.000|20110113050126.000|TR0|Gabby opened her eyes.

20110113050134.000|20110113050137.000|TR0|Gabby opened her eyes, so I can tell you, 
20110113050137.000|20110113050140.000|TR0|she knows we are here, she knows we love 
20110113050140.000|20110113050143.000|TR0|her, and she knows that we are rooting for 
20110113050143.000|20110113050146.000|TR0|her through what is undoubtedly going to 
20110113050146.000|20110113050149.000|TR0|be a difficult journey.  We are there for 
20110113050149.000|20110113050151.000|TR0|her.
20110113050151.000|20110113050154.000|TR0|
20110113050154.000|20110113050157.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110113050157.000|20110113050200.000|TR0|
20110113050200.000|20110113050203.000|TR0|Our hearts are full of thanks for that 
20110113050203.000|20110113050206.000|TR0|good news, and our hearts are full of 
20110113050206.000|20110113050208.000|TR0|gratitude for those who saved others.  We 
20110113050208.000|20110113050211.000|TR0|are grateful to Daniel Hernandez...
20110113050211.000|20110113050214.000|TR0|

20110113050220.000|20110113050223.000|TR0|... a volunteer in Gabby's office.
20110113050223.000|20110113050225.000|TR0|
20110113050225.000|20110113050228.000|TR0|And, Daniel, I'm sorry, you may deny it, 
20110113050228.000|20110113050231.000|TR0|but we've decided you are a hero, because 
20110113050231.000|20110113050234.000|TR0|you ran through the chaos to minister to 
20110113050234.000|20110113050237.000|TR0|your boss and tended to her wounds and 
20110113050237.000|20110113050240.000|TR0|help keep her alive.
20110113050240.000|20110113050243.000|TR0|
20110113050243.000|20110113050245.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110113050245.000|20110113050248.000|TR0|
20110113050248.000|20110113050251.000|TR0|We are grateful to the men who tackled the 
20110113050251.000|20110113050254.000|TR0|gunman as he stopped to reload.
20110113050254.000|20110113050257.000|TR0|
20110113050257.000|20110113050300.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)      They're right over there.
20110113050300.000|20110113050302.000|TR0|
20110113050302.000|20110113050305.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110113050305.000|20110113050308.000|TR0|
20110113050308.000|20110113050311.000|TR0|We -- we are grateful for petite Patricia 
20110113050311.000|20110113050314.000|TR0|Maisch, who wrestled away the killer's 
20110113050314.000|20110113050317.000|TR0|ammunition and undoubtedly saved some 
20110113050317.000|20110113050319.000|TR0|lives.
20110113050319.000|20110113050322.000|TR0|

20110113050328.000|20110113050331.000|TR0|And we are grateful for the doctors and 
20110113050331.000|20110113050334.000|TR0|nurses and first responders...
20110113050334.000|20110113050336.000|TR0|
20110113050336.000|20110113050339.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110113050339.000|20110113050342.000|TR0|
20110113050342.000|20110113050345.000|TR0|... who worked wonders to heal those who'd 
20110113050345.000|20110113050348.000|TR0|been hurt.  We are grateful to them.
20110113050348.000|20110113050351.000|TR0|
20110113050351.000|20110113050353.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110113050353.000|20110113050356.000|TR0|
20110113050356.000|20110113050359.000|TR0|These men and women remind us that heroism 
20110113050359.000|20110113050402.000|TR0|is found not only on the fields of battle. 
20110113050402.000|20110113050405.000|TR0| They remind us that heroism does not 
20110113050405.000|20110113050408.000|TR0|require special training or physical 
20110113050408.000|20110113050410.000|TR0|strength.  Heroism is here, in the hearts 
20110113050410.000|20110113050413.000|TR0|of so many of our fellow citizens, all 
20110113050413.000|20110113050416.000|TR0|around us, just waiting to be summoned, as 
20110113050416.000|20110113050419.000|TR0|it was on Saturday morning.
20110113050419.000|20110113050422.000|TR0|
20110113050422.000|20110113050425.000|TR0|Their actions, their selflessness poses a 
20110113050425.000|20110113050427.000|TR0|challenge to each of us.  It raises the 
20110113050427.000|20110113050430.000|TR0|question of what, beyond prayers and 
20110113050430.000|20110113050433.000|TR0|expressions of concern, is required of us 
20110113050433.000|20110113050436.000|TR0|going forward.  How can we honor the 
20110113050436.000|20110113050439.000|TR0|fallen?  How can we be true to their 
20110113050439.000|20110113050442.000|TR0|memory?
20110113050442.000|20110113050444.000|TR0|
20110113050444.000|20110113050447.000|TR0|You see, when a tragedy like this strikes, 
20110113050447.000|20110113050450.000|TR0|it is part of our nature to demand 
20110113050450.000|20110113050453.000|TR0|explanations, to try to impose some order 
20110113050453.000|20110113050456.000|TR0|on the chaos and make sense out of that 
20110113050456.000|20110113050459.000|TR0|which seems senseless.
20110113050459.000|20110113050502.000|TR0|
20110113050502.000|20110113050504.000|TR0|Already, we've seen a national 
20110113050504.000|20110113050507.000|TR0|conversation commence, not only about the 
20110113050507.000|20110113050510.000|TR0|motivations behind these killings, but 
20110113050510.000|20110113050513.000|TR0|about everything from the merits of gun 
20110113050513.000|20110113050516.000|TR0|safety laws to the adequacy of our mental 
20110113050516.000|20110113050519.000|TR0|health system.  And much -- much of this 
20110113050519.000|20110113050521.000|TR0|process...
20110113050521.000|20110113050524.000|TR0|
20110113050524.000|20110113050527.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110113050527.000|20110113050530.000|TR0|
20110113050530.000|20110113050533.000|TR0|... of debating what might be done to 
20110113050533.000|20110113050536.000|TR0|prevent such tragedies in the future is an 
20110113050536.000|20110113050538.000|TR0|essential ingredient in our exercise of 
20110113050538.000|20110113050541.000|TR0|self- government.
20110113050541.000|20110113050544.000|TR0|
20110113050544.000|20110113050547.000|TR0|But at a time when our discourse has 
20110113050547.000|20110113050550.000|TR0|become so sharply polarized, at a time 
20110113050550.000|20110113050553.000|TR0|when we are far too eager to lay the blame 
20110113050553.000|20110113050555.000|TR0|for all that ails the world at the feet of 
20110113050555.000|20110113050558.000|TR0|those who happen to think differently than 
20110113050558.000|20110113050601.000|TR0|we do, it's important for us to pause for 
20110113050601.000|20110113050604.000|TR0|a moment and make sure that we're talking 
20110113050604.000|20110113050607.000|TR0|with each other in a way that -- that 
20110113050607.000|20110113050610.000|TR0|heals, not in a way that wounds.
20110113050610.000|20110113050612.000|TR0|
20110113050612.000|20110113050615.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110113050615.000|20110113050618.000|TR0|
20110113050618.000|20110113050621.000|TR0|Scripture tells us that there is evil in 
20110113050621.000|20110113050624.000|TR0|the world and that terrible things happen 
20110113050624.000|20110113050627.000|TR0|for reasons that defy human understanding. 
20110113050627.000|20110113050629.000|TR0| In the words of Job, "When I looked for 
20110113050629.000|20110113050632.000|TR0|light, then came darkness."  Bad things 
20110113050632.000|20110113050635.000|TR0|happen, and we have to guard against 
20110113050635.000|20110113050638.000|TR0|simple explanations in the aftermath.
20110113050638.000|20110113050641.000|TR0|
20110113050641.000|20110113050644.000|TR0|For the truth is, none of us can know 
20110113050644.000|20110113050646.000|TR0|exactly what triggered this vicious 
20110113050646.000|20110113050649.000|TR0|attack.  None of us can know with any 
20110113050649.000|20110113050652.000|TR0|certainty what might have stopped these 
20110113050652.000|20110113050655.000|TR0|shots from being fired or what thoughts 
20110113050655.000|20110113050658.000|TR0|lurked in the inner recesses of a violent 
20110113050658.000|20110113050701.000|TR0|man's mind.
20110113050701.000|20110113050703.000|TR0|
20110113050703.000|20110113050706.000|TR0|Yes, we had to examine all the facts 
20110113050706.000|20110113050709.000|TR0|behind this tragedy.  We cannot and will 
20110113050709.000|20110113050712.000|TR0|not be passive in the face of such 
20110113050712.000|20110113050715.000|TR0|violence.  We should be willing to 
20110113050715.000|20110113050718.000|TR0|challenge old assumptions in order to 
20110113050718.000|20110113050721.000|TR0|lessen the prospects of such violence in 
20110113050721.000|20110113050723.000|TR0|the future.
20110113050723.000|20110113050726.000|TR0|

20110113050732.000|20110113050735.000|TR0|But what we cannot do is use this tragedy 
20110113050735.000|20110113050738.000|TR0|as one more occasion to turn on each other.

20110113050800.000|20110113050803.000|TR0|
20110113050803.000|20110113050806.000|TR0|As we discuss these issues, let each of us 
20110113050806.000|20110113050809.000|TR0|do so with a good dose of humility.  
20110113050809.000|20110113050812.000|TR0|Rather than pointing fingers or assigning 
20110113050812.000|20110113050814.000|TR0|blame, let's use this occasion to expand 
20110113050814.000|20110113050817.000|TR0|our moral imaginations, to listen to each 
20110113050817.000|20110113050820.000|TR0|other more carefully, to sharpen our 
20110113050820.000|20110113050823.000|TR0|instincts for empathy, and remind 
20110113050823.000|20110113050826.000|TR0|ourselves of all the ways that our hopes 
20110113050826.000|20110113050829.000|TR0|and dreams are bound together.  After 
20110113050829.000|20110113050831.000|TR0|all...
20110113050831.000|20110113050834.000|TR0|
20110113050834.000|20110113050837.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110113050837.000|20110113050840.000|TR0|
20110113050840.000|20110113050843.000|TR0|After all, that's what most of us do when 
20110113050843.000|20110113050846.000|TR0|we lose somebody in our family, especially 
20110113050846.000|20110113050848.000|TR0|if the loss is unexpected.  We're shaken 
20110113050848.000|20110113050851.000|TR0|out of our routines.  We're forced to look 
20110113050851.000|20110113050854.000|TR0|inward.  We reflect on the past.
20110113050854.000|20110113050857.000|TR0|
20110113050857.000|20110113050900.000|TR0|Did we spend enough time with an aging -- 
20110113050900.000|20110113050903.000|TR0|an aging parent, we wonder?  Did we 
20110113050903.000|20110113050905.000|TR0|express our gratitude for all the 
20110113050905.000|20110113050908.000|TR0|sacrifices that they made for us?  Did we 
20110113050908.000|20110113050911.000|TR0|tell a spouse just how desperately we 
20110113050911.000|20110113050914.000|TR0|loved them, not just once in a while, but 
20110113050914.000|20110113050917.000|TR0|every single day?
20110113050917.000|20110113050920.000|TR0|
20110113050920.000|20110113050922.000|TR0|So sudden loss causes us to look backward, 
20110113050922.000|20110113050925.000|TR0|but it also forces us to look forward, to 
20110113050925.000|20110113050928.000|TR0|reflect on the present and the future, on 
20110113050928.000|20110113050931.000|TR0|the manner in which we live our lives and 
20110113050931.000|20110113050934.000|TR0|nurture our relationships with those who 
20110113050934.000|20110113050937.000|TR0|are still with us.
20110113050937.000|20110113050940.000|TR0|
20110113050940.000|20110113050942.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)     We may ask ourselves if 
20110113050942.000|20110113050945.000|TR0|we've shown enough kindness and generosity 
20110113050945.000|20110113050948.000|TR0|and compassion to the people in our lives. 
20110113050948.000|20110113050951.000|TR0| Perhaps we question whether we're doing 
20110113050951.000|20110113050954.000|TR0|right by our children, or our community, 
20110113050954.000|20110113050957.000|TR0|whether our priorities are in order.  We 
20110113050957.000|20110113050959.000|TR0|recognize our own mortality. And we are 
20110113050959.000|20110113051002.000|TR0|reminded that, in the fleeting time we 
20110113051002.000|20110113051005.000|TR0|have on this Earth, what matters is not 
20110113051005.000|20110113051008.000|TR0|wealth, or status, or power, or fame, but 
20110113051008.000|20110113051011.000|TR0|rather how well we have loved and what 
20110113051011.000|20110113051014.000|TR0|small part we have played in making the 
20110113051014.000|20110113051016.000|TR0|lives of other people better.

20110113051025.000|20110113051028.000|TR0|And that process -- that process of 
20110113051028.000|20110113051031.000|TR0|reflection, of making sure we align our 
20110113051031.000|20110113051033.000|TR0|values with our actions, that, I believe, 
20110113051033.000|20110113051036.000|TR0|is what a tragedy like this requires.
20110113051036.000|20110113051039.000|TR0|
20110113051039.000|20110113051042.000|TR0|For those who were harmed, those who were 
20110113051042.000|20110113051045.000|TR0|killed, they are part of our family, an 
20110113051045.000|20110113051048.000|TR0|American family, 300 million strong.

20110113051056.000|20110113051059.000|TR0|surely we see ourselves in them.  In 
20110113051059.000|20110113051102.000|TR0|George and Dot, in Dorwin and Mavy, we 
20110113051102.000|20110113051105.000|TR0|sense the abiding love we have for our own 
20110113051105.000|20110113051107.000|TR0|husbands, our own wives, our own life

20110113051133.000|20110113051136.000|TR0|well, but also a man who embodied

20110113051150.000|20110113051153.000|TR0|reflection of our public- spiritedness, 
20110113051153.000|20110113051156.000|TR0|that desire to participate in that 
20110113051156.000|20110113051158.000|TR0|sometimes frustrating, sometimes 
20110113051158.000|20110113051201.000|TR0|contentious, but always necessary and 
20110113051201.000|20110113051204.000|TR0|never- ending process to form a more

20110113051224.000|20110113051227.000|TR0|deserving of our love, and so deserving of

20110113051255.000|20110113051258.000|TR0|pettiness that drifts away in the next

20110113051315.000|20110113051318.000|TR0|co-workers and parents.       And if, as 
20110113051318.000|20110113051321.000|TR0|has been discussed in recent days, their 
20110113051321.000|20110113051324.000|TR0|death helps usher in more civility in our

20110113051326.000|20110113051329.000|TR0|not because a simple lack of civility 
20110113051329.000|20110113051332.000|TR0|caused this tragedy -- it did not -- but 
20110113051332.000|20110113051335.000|TR0|rather because only a more civil and 
20110113051335.000|20110113051338.000|TR0|honest public discourse can help us face 
20110113051338.000|20110113051341.000|TR0|up to the challenges of our nation in a

20110113051358.000|20110113051400.000|TR0|John Roll and Gabby Giffords, who knew

20110113051440.000|20110113051443.000|TR0|help me believe. We may not be able to

20110113051503.000|20110113051506.000|TR0|imperfections, we are full of decency and 
20110113051506.000|20110113051509.000|TR0|goodness and that the forces that divide 
20110113051509.000|20110113051511.000|TR0|us are not as strong as those that unite 
20110113051511.000|20110113051514.000|TR0|us.

20110113051523.000|20110113051526.000|TR0|That's what I believe, in part because 
20110113051526.000|20110113051528.000|TR0|that's what a child like Christina-Taylor 
20110113051528.000|20110113051531.000|TR0|Green believed.

20110113051540.000|20110113051543.000|TR0|Imagine -- can you imagine for a moment, 
20110113051543.000|20110113051545.000|TR0|here was a young girl who was just 
20110113051545.000|20110113051548.000|TR0|becoming aware of our democracy, just 
20110113051548.000|20110113051551.000|TR0|beginning to understand the obligations of 
20110113051551.000|20110113051554.000|TR0|citizenship, just starting to glimpse the 
20110113051554.000|20110113051557.000|TR0|fact that someday she, too, might play a 
20110113051557.000|20110113051600.000|TR0|part in shaping her nation's future.
20110113051600.000|20110113051602.000|TR0|
20110113051602.000|20110113051605.000|TR0|She had been elected to her student 
20110113051605.000|20110113051608.000|TR0|council.  She saw public service as 
20110113051608.000|20110113051611.000|TR0|something exciting and hopeful.  She was 
20110113051611.000|20110113051614.000|TR0|off to meet her congresswoman, someone she 
20110113051614.000|20110113051617.000|TR0|was sure was good and important and might 
20110113051617.000|20110113051619.000|TR0|be a role model.  She saw all this through 
20110113051619.000|20110113051622.000|TR0|the eyes of a child, undimmed by the 
20110113051622.000|20110113051625.000|TR0|cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too 
20110113051625.000|20110113051628.000|TR0|often just take for granted.
20110113051628.000|20110113051631.000|TR0|
20110113051631.000|20110113051634.000|TR0|I want us to live up to her expectations.

20110113051645.000|20110113051648.000|TR0|Christina imagined it.  I want America to 
20110113051648.000|20110113051651.000|TR0|be as good as she imagined it.  All of us, 
20110113051651.000|20110113051654.000|TR0|we should do everything we can to make 
20110113051654.000|20110113051656.000|TR0|sure this country lives up to our

20110113051711.000|20110113051713.000|TR0|was given to us on September 11th, 2001,

20110113051719.000|20110113051722.000|TR0| On either side of her photo in that book 
20110113051722.000|20110113051725.000|TR0|were simple wishes for a child's life:  "I 
20110113051725.000|20110113051728.000|TR0|hope you help those in need," read one.  
20110113051728.000|20110113051730.000|TR0|"I hope you know all of the words to the

20110113052021.000|20110113052023.000|TR0|down to touch the tips of a few high 
20110113052023.000|20110113052026.000|TR0|leaves that do not stir.  As though they 
20110113052026.000|20110113052029.000|TR0|have not noticed and did not know you at

20110113052200.000|20110113052203.000|TR0|tragedy prompts reflection and debate, as 
20110113052203.000|20110113052206.000|TR0|it should, let's make sure it's worthy of

20110113052231.000|20110113052234.000|TR0|Kelly, was there, sitting right next to 
20110113052234.000|20110113052237.000|TR0|the first lady of the United States.
20110113052237.000|20110113052240.000|TR0|
20110113052240.000|20110113052242.000|TR0|John King is there in Tucson watching all 
20110113052242.000|20110113052245.000|TR0|of this unfold.  John.
20110113052245.000|20110113052248.000|TR0|
20110113052248.000|20110113052251.000|TR0|KING:  Wolf, in a poignant speech by the 
20110113052251.000|20110113052254.000|TR0|president, especially at the end when he 
20110113052254.000|20110113052257.000|TR0|used the 9-year-old victim Christina to 
20110113052257.000|20110113052259.000|TR0|rally the spirits of the country, and 
20110113052259.000|20110113052302.000|TR0|saying that no -- no active incivility 
20110113052302.000|20110113052305.000|TR0|caused this but if we are to be more civil 
20110113052305.000|20110113052308.000|TR0|in the future that is a good thing to make 
20110113052308.000|20110113052311.000|TR0|all of the victims proud, especially young 
20110113052311.000|20110113052314.000|TR0|Christina.
20110113052314.000|20110113052316.000|TR0|
20110113052316.000|20110113052319.000|TR0|They handed out t-shirts, "Together We 
20110113052319.000|20110113052322.000|TR0|Thrive: Tucson", to those going in.  
20110113052322.000|20110113052325.000|TR0|You're watching the president greet 
20110113052325.000|20110113052328.000|TR0|everybody now.
20110113052328.000|20110113052331.000|TR0|
20110113052331.000|20110113052333.000|TR0|Some at home, Wolf, might have been a bit 
20110113052333.000|20110113052336.000|TR0|surprised at how uplifting, all the 
20110113052336.000|20110113052339.000|TR0|cheering, all the clapping, and having 
20110113052339.000|20110113052342.000|TR0|been here for a few days, as you travel 
20110113052342.000|20110113052345.000|TR0|across the town, as you go into the coffee 
20110113052345.000|20110113052348.000|TR0|shops, as you're at the hospital where 
20110113052348.000|20110113052350.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords is still 
20110113052350.000|20110113052353.000|TR0|hospitalized, and some of the other 
20110113052353.000|20110113052356.000|TR0|victims, makeshift shrines in different 
20110113052356.000|20110113052359.000|TR0|places across the city, there's a lot of 
20110113052359.000|20110113052402.000|TR0|crying in Tucson the past few days.
20110113052402.000|20110113052405.000|TR0|
20110113052405.000|20110113052408.000|TR0|There's a lot of stunned, shocked silence 
20110113052408.000|20110113052410.000|TR0|in Tucson the past few days.  And I think 
20110113052410.000|20110113052413.000|TR0|on this night, after five horrific days, 
20110113052413.000|20110113052416.000|TR0|this town needed to cheer.       BLITZER:  
20110113052416.000|20110113052419.000|TR0|They certainly did.  They certainly did 
20110113052419.000|20110113052422.000|TR0|here tonight. There you see the president 
20110113052422.000|20110113052425.000|TR0|getting ready to leave.  He's been in 
20110113052425.000|20110113052427.000|TR0|Tucson now for the past few hours.  The 
20110113052427.000|20110113052430.000|TR0|first thing he did once he landed on Air 
20110113052430.000|20110113052433.000|TR0|Force One was go to the hospital and meet 
20110113052433.000|20110113052436.000|TR0|not only with Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110113052436.000|20110113052439.000|TR0|Giffords but some of the others who are 
20110113052439.000|20110113052442.000|TR0|recuperating there.
20110113052442.000|20110113052444.000|TR0|
20110113052444.000|20110113052447.000|TR0|There's so much to digest, so much to 
20110113052447.000|20110113052450.000|TR0|think about, so much to reflect on.  
20110113052450.000|20110113052453.000|TR0|Anderson Cooper is standing by to pick up

20110113052501.000|20110113052504.000|TR0|much.  Thanks.  You're watching a special 
20110113052504.000|20110113052507.000|TR0|edition of 360 as we continue, let's go 
20110113052507.000|20110113052510.000|TR0|back to Arizona, watching President Obama 
20110113052510.000|20110113052513.000|TR0|talking with the crowds.
20110113052513.000|20110113052516.000|TR0|
20110113052516.000|20110113052518.000|TR0|Events just wrapping up at the University 
20110113052518.000|20110113052521.000|TR0|of Arizona's McKale Memorial Center in 
20110113052521.000|20110113052524.000|TR0|Tucson.  People continue -- people 
20110113052524.000|20110113052527.000|TR0|continuing to talk to the president.  
20110113052527.000|20110113052530.000|TR0|People coming to mourn Saturday's fallen.  
20110113052530.000|20110113052533.000|TR0|To pray for the survivors.  To root for 
20110113052533.000|20110113052535.000|TR0|their congresswoman's full recovery.
20110113052535.000|20110113052538.000|TR0|
20110113052538.000|20110113052541.000|TR0|They came to hear President Obama as he 
20110113052541.000|20110113052544.000|TR0|did what presidents do whenever a tragedy 
20110113052544.000|20110113052547.000|TR0|strikes.  Counting on him to help them, 
20110113052547.000|20110113052550.000|TR0|help the country, help all of us start to 
20110113052550.000|20110113052552.000|TR0|heal.  We'll be replaying parts of 
20110113052552.000|20110113052555.000|TR0|President Obama's speech throughout this 
20110113052555.000|20110113052558.000|TR0|hour and through the significant portion 
20110113052558.000|20110113052601.000|TR0|of the speech at the top of the next hour 
20110113052601.000|20110113052604.000|TR0|at 10:00 p.m. Eastern in case you missed 
20110113052604.000|20110113052607.000|TR0|it.

20110113052609.000|20110113052612.000|TR0|John King is in Arizona tonight, anchor of 
20110113052612.000|20110113052615.000|TR0|"JOHN KING USA".  Also with us tonight, 
20110113052615.000|20110113052618.000|TR0|former Bush speech writer Michael Gerson, 
20110113052618.000|20110113052621.000|TR0|senior political analyst David Gergen,

20110113052624.000|20110113052627.000|TR0|former Obama campaign pollster.  Also,

20110113052638.000|20110113052641.000|TR0|Let's continue to look at that picture -- 
20110113052641.000|20110113052644.000|TR0|live picture in Arizona as we talk.  David 
20110113052644.000|20110113052646.000|TR0|Gergen, you've worked for Presidents 
20110113052646.000|20110113052649.000|TR0|Reagan and Clinton, both of whom had to 
20110113052649.000|20110113052652.000|TR0|shepherd the nation during major 
20110113052652.000|20110113052655.000|TR0|tragedies.  Your reaction to President 
20110113052655.000|20110113052658.000|TR0|Obama's remarks tonight?
20110113052658.000|20110113052701.000|TR0|
20110113052701.000|20110113052703.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL 
20110113052703.000|20110113052706.000|TR0|SPEECHWRITER:  Well, John King made a 
20110113052706.000|20110113052709.000|TR0|helpful point, because a lot of us did 
20110113052709.000|20110113052712.000|TR0|come tonight thinking this would be more 
20110113052712.000|20110113052715.000|TR0|of a solemn memorial service.  And we 
20110113052715.000|20110113052718.000|TR0|would have the kind of words that 
20110113052718.000|20110113052720.000|TR0|President Clinton used at Oklahoma City or 
20110113052720.000|20110113052723.000|TR0|that President Reagan did after the 
20110113052723.000|20110113052726.000|TR0|Challenger blew up.
20110113052726.000|20110113052729.000|TR0|
20110113052729.000|20110113052732.000|TR0|But instead, it turned it much more of a 
20110113052732.000|20110113052735.000|TR0|pep rally.  It almost kind of -- it seemed 
20110113052735.000|20110113052737.000|TR0|like a campaign rally.  But I thought John 
20110113052737.000|20110113052740.000|TR0|was helpful by saying, you know, people -- 
20110113052740.000|20110113052743.000|TR0|people in Tucson needed to cheer.
20110113052743.000|20110113052746.000|TR0|
20110113052746.000|20110113052749.000|TR0|So you had to get beyond that.  I think it 
20110113052749.000|20110113052752.000|TR0|was jarring for those -- especially for 
20110113052752.000|20110113052754.000|TR0|those of us who are more traditionalists.  
20110113052754.000|20110113052757.000|TR0|Once you got beyond that, what the 
20110113052757.000|20110113052800.000|TR0|president had to say towards the end of 
20110113052800.000|20110113052803.000|TR0|his speech was important.  Trying to 
20110113052803.000|20110113052806.000|TR0|transcend the bickering that's gone back 
20110113052806.000|20110113052809.000|TR0|and forth, and to try to find meaning 
20110113052809.000|20110113052811.000|TR0|through creating a more civil society and 
20110113052811.000|20110113052814.000|TR0|a place where we can have a more civil 
20110113052814.000|20110113052817.000|TR0|discourse, and honoring the victims 
20110113052817.000|20110113052820.000|TR0|through a more civil discourse.
20110113052820.000|20110113052823.000|TR0|
20110113052823.000|20110113052826.000|TR0|That I thought clearly resonated with the 
20110113052826.000|20110113052828.000|TR0|audience.  I'm sure it's going to resonate 
20110113052828.000|20110113052831.000|TR0|with much of the country.
20110113052831.000|20110113052834.000|TR0|
20110113052834.000|20110113052837.000|TR0|COOPER:  Paul, it was interesting, he 
20110113052837.000|20110113052840.000|TR0|talked about political discourse.  But he 
20110113052840.000|20110113052843.000|TR0|was able to do it by focusing on the 
20110113052843.000|20110113052846.000|TR0|political discourse since the shooting, as 
20110113052846.000|20110113052848.000|TR0|opposed to discourse before the shooting.
20110113052848.000|20110113052851.000|TR0|
20110113052851.000|20110113052854.000|TR0|PAUL BEGALA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I 
20110113052854.000|20110113052857.000|TR0|think that's wise.  I think he mailed a 
20110113052857.000|20110113052900.000|TR0|powerful point that when these crises 
20110113052900.000|20110113052903.000|TR0|happen, we want to try to impose order on 
20110113052903.000|20110113052905.000|TR0|chaos.  And yet, as he said, scripture 
20110113052905.000|20110113052908.000|TR0|teaches us there's always evil.
20110113052908.000|20110113052911.000|TR0|
20110113052911.000|20110113052914.000|TR0|I thought that section of it was a very 
20110113052914.000|20110113052917.000|TR0|delicate line for the president to walk.  
20110113052917.000|20110113052920.000|TR0|You know, he does not want to appear, I 
20110113052920.000|20110113052922.000|TR0|would think, lecture-y or preacher talking 
20110113052922.000|20110113052925.000|TR0|down to Americans who are having healthy 
20110113052925.000|20110113052928.000|TR0|political debates.
20110113052928.000|20110113052931.000|TR0|
20110113052931.000|20110113052934.000|TR0|And yet, this has been a recurring motif 
20110113052934.000|20110113052937.000|TR0|throughout his public career.  This 
20110113052937.000|20110113052939.000|TR0|president has always looked for unity and 
20110113052939.000|20110113052942.000|TR0|always called for civility.
20110113052942.000|20110113052945.000|TR0|
20110113052945.000|20110113052948.000|TR0|I was struck.  It seemed to me, you know, 
20110113052948.000|20110113052951.000|TR0|at over 30 minutes, it was an 
20110113052951.000|20110113052954.000|TR0|extraordinarily long speech for these 
20110113052954.000|20110113052956.000|TR0|sorts of situations. Ronald Reagan's 
20110113052956.000|20110113052959.000|TR0|Challenger speech was four and a half 
20110113052959.000|20110113053002.000|TR0|minutes.  Bill Clinton's speech in 
20110113053002.000|20110113053005.000|TR0|Oklahoma was nine minutes.  This was over 
20110113053005.000|20110113053008.000|TR0|30.
20110113053008.000|20110113053011.000|TR0|
20110113053011.000|20110113053013.000|TR0|But he was trying to do a lot of things.  
20110113053013.000|20110113053016.000|TR0|He was trying, most importantly, though, 
20110113053016.000|20110113053019.000|TR0|to speak for the fallen.  And I thought 
20110113053019.000|20110113053022.000|TR0|that's where the real power of this speech 
20110113053022.000|20110113053025.000|TR0|was, when he told the stories of the 
20110113053025.000|20110113053028.000|TR0|fallen.  And at the end, he came back, as 
20110113053028.000|20110113053030.000|TR0|David says, and reminded us that we have 
20110113053030.000|20110113053033.000|TR0|to try to lift ourselves to be worthy, 
20110113053033.000|20110113053036.000|TR0|particularly of little Christina Green.  I 
20110113053036.000|20110113053039.000|TR0|thought that was very powerful.
20110113053039.000|20110113053042.000|TR0|
20110113053042.000|20110113053045.000|TR0|COOPER:  The applause, too, oftentimes 
20110113053045.000|20110113053047.000|TR0|lengthy, added to the time more than -- 
20110113053047.000|20110113053050.000|TR0|made the speech longer than it actually 
20110113053050.000|20110113053053.000|TR0|was.  Cornell Belcher, you worked for then 
20110113053053.000|20110113053056.000|TR0|candidate Obama.  What did you make of the 
20110113053056.000|20110113053059.000|TR0|speech?
20110113053059.000|20110113053102.000|TR0|
20110113053102.000|20110113053104.000|TR0|CORNELL BELCHER, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER:  I 
20110113053104.000|20110113053107.000|TR0|got to tell you, we saw Barack Obama at 
20110113053107.000|20110113053110.000|TR0|his finest tonight.  I think you saw the 
20110113053110.000|20110113053113.000|TR0|inspiration and the passion that he spoke 
20110113053113.000|20110113053116.000|TR0|with tonight.  A lot of people say they 
20110113053116.000|20110113053119.000|TR0|hadn't seen that in Barack Obama in the 
20110113053119.000|20110113053122.000|TR0|last two years.  They hadn't seen that 
20110113053122.000|20110113053124.000|TR0|really since the campaign trail.
20110113053124.000|20110113053127.000|TR0|
20110113053127.000|20110113053130.000|TR0|A couple big things to me tonight struck 
20110113053130.000|20110113053133.000|TR0|me.  One, he was a head of state, a 
20110113053133.000|20110113053136.000|TR0|unifying figure, sort of bring us 
20110113053136.000|20110113053139.000|TR0|together.  He talked about how all our 
20110113053139.000|20110113053141.000|TR0|hopes and dreams are bound together.  And 
20110113053141.000|20110113053144.000|TR0|then he went to our core values, talking 
20110113053144.000|20110113053147.000|TR0|about what -- in the end what, matters is 
20110113053147.000|20110113053150.000|TR0|how we love, which has a really strong 
20110113053150.000|20110113053153.000|TR0|faith undertone, which is important for 
20110113053153.000|20110113053156.000|TR0|the country.       And then he got above 
20110113053156.000|20110113053158.000|TR0|the politics.  He talked about how we 
20110113053158.000|20110113053201.000|TR0|can't use this occasion as one to attack 
20110113053201.000|20110113053204.000|TR0|each other.  Then he went straight -- to 
20110113053204.000|20110113053207.000|TR0|me, straight to something that is circling 
20110113053207.000|20110113053210.000|TR0|in Washington right now when he said no 
20110113053210.000|20110113053213.000|TR0|one can know what triggered this.
20110113053213.000|20110113053215.000|TR0|
20110113053215.000|20110113053218.000|TR0|So he got above the politics in a way I 
20110113053218.000|20110113053221.000|TR0|think was very helpful and very commander 
20110113053221.000|20110113053224.000|TR0|in chief tonight.
20110113053224.000|20110113053227.000|TR0|
20110113053227.000|20110113053230.000|TR0|COOPER:  Michael Gerson, speech writer, 
20110113053230.000|20110113053232.000|TR0|you've written a lot of speeches for 
20110113053232.000|20110113053235.000|TR0|President Bush.  What do you make of this 
20110113053235.000|20110113053238.000|TR0|one?
20110113053238.000|20110113053241.000|TR0|
20110113053241.000|20110113053244.000|TR0|MICHAEL GERSON, FORMER BUSH SPEECHWRITER:  
20110113053244.000|20110113053247.000|TR0|I thought there were good and bad tonight. 
20110113053247.000|20110113053249.000|TR0| I think the good very much, as the others 
20110113053249.000|20110113053252.000|TR0|talked about, telling the stories of 
20110113053252.000|20110113053255.000|TR0|heroism, the stories of sacrifice.  The 
20110113053255.000|20110113053258.000|TR0|president's good at that.  That's 
20110113053258.000|20110113053301.000|TR0|humanizing.  It dignifies.  The details 
20110113053301.000|20110113053304.000|TR0|dignify.  I think the president's good at 
20110113053304.000|20110113053306.000|TR0|that.
20110113053306.000|20110113053309.000|TR0|
20110113053309.000|20110113053312.000|TR0|I think, in some ways, this was a speech 
20110113053312.000|20110113053315.000|TR0|dedicated to Christina Green, to be worthy 
20110113053315.000|20110113053318.000|TR0|of her innocence.  And she had some of the 
20110113053318.000|20110113053321.000|TR0|most eloquent words of the speech, when 
20110113053321.000|20110113053323.000|TR0|she was quoted near the end.  There was a 
20110113053323.000|20110113053326.000|TR0|strong spiritual undertone in this speech 
20110113053326.000|20110113053329.000|TR0|that I thought was very appropriate.
20110113053329.000|20110113053332.000|TR0|
20110113053332.000|20110113053335.000|TR0|But it was long and it did in parts 
20110113053335.000|20110113053338.000|TR0|lecture.  The president talks about 
20110113053338.000|20110113053341.000|TR0|discourse, and he talks about the news 
20110113053341.000|20110113053343.000|TR0|cycle.  He can't resist lecturing in this 
20110113053343.000|20110113053346.000|TR0|kind of setting.  I think the speech would 
20110113053346.000|20110113053349.000|TR0|have been better without it.  And the 
20110113053349.000|20110113053352.000|TR0|setting was, frankly, strange.  You can 
20110113053352.000|20110113053355.000|TR0|either have a pep rally or a memorial 
20110113053355.000|20110113053358.000|TR0|service.  You can't have both at the same 
20110113053358.000|20110113053400.000|TR0|time.
20110113053400.000|20110113053403.000|TR0|
20110113053403.000|20110113053406.000|TR0|COOPER:  I found, just watching it, I 
20110113053406.000|20110113053409.000|TR0|think it took -- as David Gergen said, it 
20110113053409.000|20110113053412.000|TR0|took a while for viewers -- I was Tweeting 
20110113053412.000|20110113053415.000|TR0|with a lot of viewers -- to get used to 
20110113053415.000|20110113053417.000|TR0|the applause.  And not just the applause 
20110113053417.000|20110113053420.000|TR0|but the whistles and shouts out.  
20110113053420.000|20110113053423.000|TR0|Certainly I, as a viewer, found it hard at 
20110113053423.000|20110113053426.000|TR0|first to get in the rhythm of things.
20110113053426.000|20110113053429.000|TR0|
20110113053429.000|20110113053432.000|TR0|John King, as you pointed out, that didn't 
20110113053432.000|20110113053434.000|TR0|surprise you, given what you have seen, 
20110113053434.000|20110113053437.000|TR0|the people you've talked to, the spirit 
20110113053437.000|20110113053440.000|TR0|you've encountered in Arizona in the last 
20110113053440.000|20110113053443.000|TR0|couple of days.
20110113053443.000|20110113053446.000|TR0|
20110113053446.000|20110113053449.000|TR0|JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR:  Anderson, it has 
20110113053449.000|20110113053451.000|TR0|been difficult visiting coffee shops, 
20110113053451.000|20110113053454.000|TR0|being at the hospital where Congresswoman 
20110113053454.000|20110113053457.000|TR0|Giffords and some of the other victims 
20110113053457.000|20110113053500.000|TR0|still are.  I was at her office today 
20110113053500.000|20110113053503.000|TR0|where there's a makeshift shrine, and 
20110113053503.000|20110113053506.000|TR0|interviewed an aide who was standing 
20110113053506.000|20110113053508.000|TR0|there.  She takes pictures at these 
20110113053508.000|20110113053511.000|TR0|events.  She was four feet away from the 
20110113053511.000|20110113053514.000|TR0|congresswoman snapping pictures when she 
20110113053514.000|20110113053517.000|TR0|said somebody came up and stood next to 
20110113053517.000|20110113053520.000|TR0|her, said nothing.
20110113053520.000|20110113053523.000|TR0|
20110113053523.000|20110113053525.000|TR0|And then she saw the arm come up and she 
20110113053525.000|20110113053528.000|TR0|saw the gun in the shooter's hand and he 
20110113053528.000|20110113053531.000|TR0|opened fire four feet away.  So there's 
20110113053531.000|20110113053534.000|TR0|been so much crying in this town the past 
20110113053534.000|20110113053537.000|TR0|five days.  There has been so much silence 
20110113053537.000|20110113053540.000|TR0|because they're just shocked.  Forget -- 
20110113053540.000|20110113053542.000|TR0|forgive me, but forget it's a federal 
20110113053542.000|20110113053545.000|TR0|judge.  Forget it's a congresswoman.  We 
20110113053545.000|20110113053548.000|TR0|all go to the supermarket.  Just imagine 
20110113053548.000|20110113053551.000|TR0|this happening when you go to buy 
20110113053551.000|20110113053554.000|TR0|groceries.       So the community has been 
20110113053554.000|20110113053557.000|TR0|so stunned and so tearful, quiet and angry 
20110113053557.000|20110113053600.000|TR0|at the same time.  I think it simply 
20110113053600.000|20110113053602.000|TR0|needed tonight to cheer. The people here 
20110113053602.000|20110113053605.000|TR0|were stunned when they heard the president 
20110113053605.000|20110113053608.000|TR0|was coming. We think that's the 
20110113053608.000|20110113053611.000|TR0|president's responsibility, but they were 
20110113053611.000|20110113053614.000|TR0|quite surprised that the president was 
20110113053614.000|20110113053617.000|TR0|coming, grateful that he was coming.
20110113053617.000|20110113053619.000|TR0|
20110113053619.000|20110113053622.000|TR0|I think at the end of that speech, when 
20110113053622.000|20110113053625.000|TR0|you heard first a hush in the room and 
20110113053625.000|20110113053628.000|TR0|then more applause, when he was speaking 
20110113053628.000|20110113053631.000|TR0|more as a parent than as a president about 
20110113053631.000|20110113053634.000|TR0|the youngest victim and about how -- yes, 
20110113053634.000|20110113053636.000|TR0|the president said no act of uncivility 
20110113053636.000|20110113053639.000|TR0|caused this to happen, but if we can be 
20110113053639.000|20110113053642.000|TR0|more civil going forward, to set an 
20110113053642.000|20110113053645.000|TR0|example, to live up to the expectations of 
20110113053645.000|20110113053648.000|TR0|our children -- that at the end was very, 
20110113053648.000|20110113053651.000|TR0|very powerful.
20110113053651.000|20110113053653.000|TR0|
20110113053653.000|20110113053656.000|TR0|One last footnote; these are t-shirts they 
20110113053656.000|20110113053659.000|TR0|gave out to people, anyone who went into 
20110113053659.000|20110113053702.000|TR0|the auditorium today, "Together We Thrive, 
20110113053702.000|20110113053705.000|TR0|Tucson and America."  There's a sense of 
20110113053705.000|20110113053708.000|TR0|unity in this community, Anderson, even as 
20110113053708.000|20110113053710.000|TR0|it is still going through quite a bit of 
20110113053710.000|20110113053713.000|TR0|shock.

20110113053716.000|20110113053719.000|TR0|COOPER:  It's interesting, John, because 
20110113053719.000|20110113053722.000|TR0|actually, on a number of conservative 
20110113053722.000|20110113053725.000|TR0|blogs, there's writers sort of attacking 
20110113053725.000|20110113053727.000|TR0|those t-shirts, saying it's some sort of 
20110113053727.000|20110113053730.000|TR0|branding by the Democratic party.  Whose 
20110113053730.000|20110113053733.000|TR0|t- shirts are those?
20110113053733.000|20110113053736.000|TR0|
20110113053736.000|20110113053739.000|TR0|KING:  It is the university handing them 
20110113053739.000|20110113053742.000|TR0|out.  That also was the title, Anderson -- 
20110113053742.000|20110113053744.000|TR0|forgive me for turning but -- of the 
20110113053744.000|20110113053747.000|TR0|program tonight.  I'm holding up the 
20110113053747.000|20110113053750.000|TR0|official program put out by the 
20110113053750.000|20110113053753.000|TR0|university.  So these were all given to us 
20110113053753.000|20110113053756.000|TR0|by university officials, not by anybody 
20110113053756.000|20110113053759.000|TR0|with the Democratic.
20110113053759.000|20110113053801.000|TR0|
20110113053801.000|20110113053804.000|TR0|When we're done with the program, we can 
20110113053804.000|20110113053807.000|TR0|trace back, see where they came from, the 
20110113053807.000|20110113053810.000|TR0|source.  But our source for them were the 
20110113053810.000|20110113053813.000|TR0|volunteers outside of the event handing 
20110113053813.000|20110113053816.000|TR0|them out.  This came directly from the 
20110113053816.000|20110113053819.000|TR0|university.

20110113053830.000|20110113053833.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords has opened her 
20110113053833.000|20110113053836.000|TR0|eyes.  We'll talk to him and our panel as 
20110113053836.000|20110113053838.000|TR0|we continue our coverage.  And more, a 
20110113053838.000|20110113053841.000|TR0|significant chunk of the president's 
20110113053841.000|20110113053844.000|TR0|address we'll replay you at the top of 
20110113053844.000|20110113053847.000|TR0|this hour, at 10:00.  We'll be right back.

20110113053858.000|20110113053901.000|TR0|tonight.  John King is in Arizona.  Also 
20110113053901.000|20110113053904.000|TR0|former bush speech writer Michael Gerson 
20110113053904.000|20110113053907.000|TR0|is with us. Senior political analyst David

20110113053921.000|20110113053924.000|TR0|Dr. Gupta, we got news tonight from the 
20110113053924.000|20110113053927.000|TR0|president himself during his speech.  It 
20110113053927.000|20110113053929.000|TR0|was a surprise, because it wasn't in the 
20110113053929.000|20110113053932.000|TR0|prepared remarks that were sent out to 
20110113053932.000|20110113053935.000|TR0|reporters moments before the president 
20110113053935.000|20110113053938.000|TR0|began to speak.  I just want to play for 
20110113053938.000|20110113053941.000|TR0|our viewers the news we heard about 
20110113053941.000|20110113053944.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords from the president.

20110113053952.000|20110113053955.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110113053955.000|20110113053958.000|TR0|STATES:  I want to tell you, her husband 
20110113053958.000|20110113054001.000|TR0|Mark is here, and he allows me to share 
20110113054001.000|20110113054003.000|TR0|this with you.  Right after we went to 
20110113054003.000|20110113054006.000|TR0|visit, a few minutes after we left her 
20110113054006.000|20110113054009.000|TR0|room and some of her colleagues from 
20110113054009.000|20110113054012.000|TR0|Congress were in the room, Gabby opened 
20110113054012.000|20110113054015.000|TR0|her eyes for the first time.
20110113054015.000|20110113054018.000|TR0|
20110113054018.000|20110113054020.000|TR0|Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.
20110113054020.000|20110113054023.000|TR0|
20110113054023.000|20110113054026.000|TR0|Gabby opened her eyes.  Gabby opened her 
20110113054026.000|20110113054029.000|TR0|eyes so I can tell you she knows we are 
20110113054029.000|20110113054032.000|TR0|here.  She knows we love her.  She knows 
20110113054032.000|20110113054035.000|TR0|that we are rooting for her through what 
20110113054035.000|20110113054037.000|TR0|is undoubtedly going to be a difficult 
20110113054037.000|20110113054040.000|TR0|journey.  We are there for her.

20110113054049.000|20110113054052.000|TR0|COOPER:  Very surprising emotional moment. 
20110113054052.000|20110113054055.000|TR0| What does that mean? She's opened her 
20110113054055.000|20110113054057.000|TR0|eyes?  We were told earlier, Sanjay, by 
20110113054057.000|20110113054100.000|TR0|doctors that she was having spontaneous 
20110113054100.000|20110113054103.000|TR0|movements.
20110113054103.000|20110113054106.000|TR0|
20110113054106.000|20110113054109.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL 
20110113054109.000|20110113054112.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, you know, when you 
20110113054112.000|20110113054114.000|TR0|start to evaluate someone's neurological 
20110113054114.000|20110113054117.000|TR0|exam, there's three sort of components 
20110113054117.000|20110113054120.000|TR0|that become important.  One's motor 
20110113054120.000|20110113054123.000|TR0|skills. We've talked about this a lot in 
20110113054123.000|20110113054126.000|TR0|terms of her following commands. Verbal 
20110113054126.000|20110113054129.000|TR0|skills, which she can't do right now.  She 
20110113054129.000|20110113054131.000|TR0|has a breathing tube in place.
20110113054131.000|20110113054134.000|TR0|
20110113054134.000|20110113054137.000|TR0|Eye opening is sort of the third 
20110113054137.000|20110113054140.000|TR0|component.  And opening your eyes, 
20110113054140.000|20110113054143.000|TR0|obviously, a significant thing.  Now 
20110113054143.000|20110113054146.000|TR0|whether she was doing that spontaneously 
20110113054146.000|20110113054148.000|TR0|or whether she was doing that because 
20110113054148.000|20110113054151.000|TR0|someone asked her to or responding to her 
20110113054151.000|20110113054154.000|TR0|name in some way, that would tell us a 
20110113054154.000|20110113054157.000|TR0|little more about this.
20110113054157.000|20110113054200.000|TR0|
20110113054200.000|20110113054203.000|TR0|Certainly every day, Anderson, that we've 
20110113054203.000|20110113054205.000|TR0|talked about this, now, the last several 
20110113054205.000|20110113054208.000|TR0|days, there's been some new -- something 
20110113054208.000|20110113054211.000|TR0|new to report that's been a positive 
20110113054211.000|20110113054214.000|TR0|development.  And certainly in this world 
20110113054214.000|20110113054217.000|TR0|of neurosurgery and recovering from brain 
20110113054217.000|20110113054220.000|TR0|injury, you want a positive development 
20110113054220.000|20110113054222.000|TR0|every single day.  You certainly don't 
20110113054222.000|20110113054225.000|TR0|want something to go backwards.  
20110113054225.000|20110113054228.000|TR0|Obviously, a very positive sign.
20110113054228.000|20110113054231.000|TR0|
20110113054231.000|20110113054234.000|TR0|COOPER:  At this point, do we -- that 
20110113054234.000|20110113054237.000|TR0|would mean she's conscious? I mean if 
20110113054237.000|20110113054239.000|TR0|she's having spontaneous movements, but 
20110113054239.000|20110113054242.000|TR0|her eyes weren't open, was she conscious 
20110113054242.000|20110113054245.000|TR0|when she was doing that?
20110113054245.000|20110113054248.000|TR0|
20110113054248.000|20110113054251.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Good point.  What I will tell you 
20110113054251.000|20110113054254.000|TR0|is this: movement alone is -- doesn't tell 
20110113054254.000|20110113054256.000|TR0|you a lot unless it is both spontaneous 
20110113054256.000|20110113054259.000|TR0|and purposeful.  What I was listening for 
20110113054259.000|20110113054302.000|TR0|when Dr. Rhee was speaking and describing 
20110113054302.000|20110113054305.000|TR0|this earlier; she's having spontaneous 
20110113054305.000|20110113054308.000|TR0|movements, but it was to sort of, for 
20110113054308.000|20110113054311.000|TR0|example, adjust her hospital gown.  That's 
20110113054311.000|20110113054314.000|TR0|a purposeful movement.  It was to take her 
20110113054314.000|20110113054316.000|TR0|hand to a wound and sort of feel that.  
20110113054316.000|20110113054319.000|TR0|That's a purposeful movement.
20110113054319.000|20110113054322.000|TR0|
20110113054322.000|20110113054325.000|TR0|That's different than just reflective 
20110113054325.000|20110113054328.000|TR0|movements, which don't give you a real 
20110113054328.000|20110113054331.000|TR0|indication of higher brain function.  So 
20110113054331.000|20110113054333.000|TR0|both the movements, as well as the eye 
20110113054333.000|20110113054336.000|TR0|opening, especially if it was in response 
20110113054336.000|20110113054339.000|TR0|to her name being called out or her being 
20110113054339.000|20110113054342.000|TR0|asked to open her eyes, are very 
20110113054342.000|20110113054345.000|TR0|significant in terms of higher cognitive 
20110113054345.000|20110113054348.000|TR0|activity.
20110113054348.000|20110113054350.000|TR0|
20110113054350.000|20110113054353.000|TR0|COOPER:  David Gergen, did the president 
20110113054353.000|20110113054356.000|TR0|do what he needed to do tonight? There was 
20110113054356.000|20110113054359.000|TR0|so much rising vitriol over the reaction 
20110113054359.000|20110113054402.000|TR0|to the shooting.  Did he -- do you think 
20110113054402.000|20110113054405.000|TR0|he cooled things down?
20110113054405.000|20110113054407.000|TR0|
20110113054407.000|20110113054410.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Well, Anderson, I do think that 
20110113054410.000|20110113054413.000|TR0|he may have helped to cool things down.  
20110113054413.000|20110113054416.000|TR0|Rick Davis with CNN has sent a note to 
20110113054416.000|20110113054419.000|TR0|several of us pointing out some Tweets 
20110113054419.000|20110113054422.000|TR0|from some conservative commentators, both 
20110113054422.000|20110113054424.000|TR0|"National Review" and the "Weekly 
20110113054424.000|20110113054427.000|TR0|Standard," praising the president's 
20110113054427.000|20110113054430.000|TR0|speech, seeing it, in fact, as him telling 
20110113054430.000|20110113054433.000|TR0|the left to cool it.
20110113054433.000|20110113054436.000|TR0|
20110113054436.000|20110113054439.000|TR0|After all, it's been the liberals who led 
20110113054439.000|20110113054441.000|TR0|the charge about what happened there.  And 
20110113054441.000|20110113054444.000|TR0|the conservatives countercharged.  And so 
20110113054444.000|20110113054447.000|TR0|the right, in a sense, sees this as an 
20110113054447.000|20110113054450.000|TR0|effort to sort of say, hey, wait a minute, 
20110113054450.000|20110113054453.000|TR0|my friends on the left, don't blame the 
20110113054453.000|20110113054456.000|TR0|rhetoric for all of this.  Let's go to a 
20110113054456.000|20110113054458.000|TR0|more civil discourse.
20110113054458.000|20110113054501.000|TR0|
20110113054501.000|20110113054504.000|TR0|I think, in that sense, he may have helped 
20110113054504.000|20110113054507.000|TR0|cool things down.  As terms of a Oklahoma 
20110113054507.000|20110113054510.000|TR0|City moment that we talked about before, a 
20110113054510.000|20110113054513.000|TR0|speech that would transform his 
20110113054513.000|20110113054515.000|TR0|presidency, I have a hard time saying that 
20110113054515.000|20110113054518.000|TR0|happened tonight.  I think this context, 
20110113054518.000|20110113054521.000|TR0|because it seemed so much like a campaign 
20110113054521.000|20110113054524.000|TR0|rally, that may have worked well within 
20110113054524.000|20110113054527.000|TR0|the hall, but I'm not sure it worked as 
20110113054527.000|20110113054530.000|TR0|well with a national audience.
20110113054530.000|20110113054533.000|TR0|
20110113054533.000|20110113054535.000|TR0|I think probably did not lift the speech 
20110113054535.000|20110113054538.000|TR0|into the annals of great oratory, where 
20110113054538.000|20110113054541.000|TR0|you find a moment that transforms 
20110113054541.000|20110113054544.000|TR0|presidencies.
20110113054544.000|20110113054547.000|TR0|
20110113054547.000|20110113054550.000|TR0|COOPER:  Although Paul, it's interesting, 
20110113054550.000|20110113054552.000|TR0|I'm getting a lot of Tweets from viewers 
20110113054552.000|20110113054555.000|TR0|who were watching who felt, as Cornell 
20110113054555.000|20110113054558.000|TR0|mentioned, sort of a return to the Obama 
20110113054558.000|20110113054601.000|TR0|of old.  You could almost -- you know, the 
20110113054601.000|20110113054604.000|TR0|pattern of his voice changed and he seemed 
20110113054604.000|20110113054607.000|TR0|to, as the speech went on, sort of it 
20110113054607.000|20110113054609.000|TR0|echoed the Obama that many people came to 
20110113054609.000|20110113054612.000|TR0|-- you know, came to vote for on the 
20110113054612.000|20110113054615.000|TR0|campaign trail.
20110113054615.000|20110113054618.000|TR0|
20110113054618.000|20110113054621.000|TR0|BEGALA:  Yeah, I've been getting messages 
20110113054621.000|20110113054624.000|TR0|like that as well from friends of mine.  
20110113054624.000|20110113054626.000|TR0|He seemed -- and I'm trying to think of 
20110113054626.000|20110113054629.000|TR0|the right way to say this.  He seemed much 
20110113054629.000|20110113054632.000|TR0|more comfortable than he sometimes is.
20110113054632.000|20110113054635.000|TR0|
20110113054635.000|20110113054638.000|TR0|This is as difficult a challenge as a 
20110113054638.000|20110113054641.000|TR0|president faces.  And yet he seemed 
20110113054641.000|20110113054643.000|TR0|remarkably relaxed.  He was in command.  
20110113054643.000|20110113054646.000|TR0|Went off the prompter from time to time.  
20110113054646.000|20110113054649.000|TR0|He kind of joshed that young hero, Daniel 
20110113054649.000|20110113054652.000|TR0|Hernandez, and said, yes, in fact, young 
20110113054652.000|20110113054655.000|TR0|man, you are a hero.
20110113054655.000|20110113054658.000|TR0|
20110113054658.000|20110113054700.000|TR0|So yes, I think David's right.  This is 
20110113054700.000|20110113054703.000|TR0|not going to transform his presidency.  I 
20110113054703.000|20110113054706.000|TR0|don't know if in 10 or 15 years people 
20110113054706.000|20110113054709.000|TR0|will watch this speech and weep.  I do 
20110113054709.000|20110113054712.000|TR0|think it helped to reconnect him to his 
20110113054712.000|20110113054715.000|TR0|constituents, to our country, in a more 
20110113054715.000|20110113054717.000|TR0|human way.
20110113054717.000|20110113054720.000|TR0|
20110113054720.000|20110113054723.000|TR0|The best parts of that speech were when he 
20110113054723.000|20110113054726.000|TR0|spoke as a father, not as a professor, not 
20110113054726.000|20110113054729.000|TR0|even as a president.  But when he spoke as 
20110113054729.000|20110113054732.000|TR0|a father, you could see how powerful.  I 
20110113054732.000|20110113054734.000|TR0|thought he was going to cry when he kept 
20110113054734.000|20110113054737.000|TR0|looking down -- did you notice, when he 
20110113054737.000|20110113054740.000|TR0|was talk about Christina at the end, he 
20110113054740.000|20110113054743.000|TR0|couldn't even look up at us I think for 
20110113054743.000|20110113054746.000|TR0|fear of losing control of his emotions.    
20110113054746.000|20110113054749.000|TR0|   COOPER:  David -- Michael Gerson, I 
20110113054749.000|20110113054752.000|TR0|want to ask you, David Gergen mentioned 
20110113054752.000|20110113054754.000|TR0|some of these Tweets.  From Stephen Hayes 
20110113054754.000|20110113054757.000|TR0|of the "Weekly Standard," he said 
20110113054757.000|20110113054800.000|TR0|"President Obama gave an exceptional 
20110113054800.000|20110113054803.000|TR0|speech, empathetic, moving, strong, 
20110113054803.000|20110113054806.000|TR0|optimistic, important."  And Rich Lowry 
20110113054806.000|20110113054809.000|TR0|over at the "National Review" said, "well 
20110113054809.000|20110113054811.000|TR0|done, Mr. President.  Shows the right saw 
20110113054811.000|20110113054814.000|TR0|his cool to blame game, his advice to 
20110113054814.000|20110113054817.000|TR0|those who are blaming right.  And those 
20110113054817.000|20110113054820.000|TR0|are the ones on the left wing."
20110113054820.000|20110113054823.000|TR0|
20110113054823.000|20110113054826.000|TR0|Do you agree with those?
20110113054826.000|20110113054828.000|TR0|
20110113054828.000|20110113054831.000|TR0|GERSON:  Well, I do think the president, 
20110113054831.000|20110113054834.000|TR0|you know, had a meditation on those 
20110113054834.000|20110113054837.000|TR0|issues.  And he criticized the blame game 
20110113054837.000|20110113054840.000|TR0|in the speech, that this was a time for 
20110113054840.000|20110113054843.000|TR0|inspiration rather than blame.  And that's 
20110113054843.000|20110113054845.000|TR0|an appropriate sentiment.
20110113054845.000|20110113054848.000|TR0|
20110113054848.000|20110113054851.000|TR0|He also said some things like, to 
20110113054851.000|20110113054854.000|TR0|challenge old assumptions in order to 
20110113054854.000|20110113054857.000|TR0|lessen the prospects of violence in the 
20110113054857.000|20110113054900.000|TR0|future.  I have no idea what he meant.  
20110113054900.000|20110113054902.000|TR0|I'm not quite sure why some of these 
20110113054902.000|20110113054905.000|TR0|things were in there.  I don't think the 
20110113054905.000|20110113054908.000|TR0|speech was a disciplined speech.  I think 
20110113054908.000|20110113054911.000|TR0|it tried to do, in some ways, too much.  
20110113054911.000|20110113054914.000|TR0|And in that way, not a memorable speech.
20110113054914.000|20110113054917.000|TR0|
20110113054917.000|20110113054919.000|TR0|But a speech, as others have said, can be 
20110113054919.000|20110113054922.000|TR0|effective without being memorable and 
20110113054922.000|20110113054925.000|TR0|eloquent.
20110113054925.000|20110113054928.000|TR0|
20110113054928.000|20110113054931.000|TR0|COOPER:  Dana Bash is actually -- well, 
20110113054931.000|20110113054934.000|TR0|actually, I'll see if I can confirm that.
20110113054934.000|20110113054936.000|TR0|
20110113054936.000|20110113054939.000|TR0|BELCHER:  Can I jump in?
20110113054939.000|20110113054942.000|TR0|
20110113054942.000|20110113054945.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yeah, go ahead.
20110113054945.000|20110113054948.000|TR0|
20110113054948.000|20110113054951.000|TR0|BELCHER:  I love how we do this in 
20110113054951.000|20110113054953.000|TR0|Washington and New York and go round and 
20110113054953.000|20110113054956.000|TR0|round.  I think the president's speech was 
20110113054956.000|20110113054959.000|TR0|effective tonight because, you know what, 
20110113054959.000|20110113055002.000|TR0|it rallied Americans.  And the cheering 
20110113055002.000|20110113055005.000|TR0|that went on, you know what, in the end, 
20110113055005.000|20110113055008.000|TR0|Americans -- after mourning, Americans 
20110113055008.000|20110113055010.000|TR0|want to cheer.  Americans want to rally 
20110113055010.000|20110113055013.000|TR0|around the flag and their leaders and want 
20110113055013.000|20110113055016.000|TR0|to cheer.
20110113055016.000|20110113055019.000|TR0|
20110113055019.000|20110113055022.000|TR0|I remember when Bush went to Ground Zero.  
20110113055022.000|20110113055025.000|TR0|And he pulled out that bull horn.  You 
20110113055025.000|20110113055028.000|TR0|know, I was never a Bush fan.  But you 
20110113055028.000|20110113055030.000|TR0|know what, I wanted to cheer.  And that's 
20110113055030.000|20110113055033.000|TR0|what the president gave us tonight.  He 
20110113055033.000|20110113055036.000|TR0|was effective at doing it.
20110113055036.000|20110113055039.000|TR0|
20110113055039.000|20110113055042.000|TR0|COOPER:  Let's talk to Cornell -- let's

20110113055059.000|20110113055102.000|TR0|whole message of the speech was sort of 
20110113055102.000|20110113055104.000|TR0|rising above it.  But Sarah Palin did put 
20110113055104.000|20110113055107.000|TR0|out basically an eight-minute video today. 
20110113055107.000|20110113055110.000|TR0| I want to play just a brief part of it

20110113055127.000|20110113055130.000|TR0|like their ideas, you're free to propose 
20110113055130.000|20110113055133.000|TR0|better ideas.
20110113055133.000|20110113055136.000|TR0|
20110113055136.000|20110113055138.000|TR0|But especially within hours of a tragedy 
20110113055138.000|20110113055141.000|TR0|unfolding, journalists and pundits should 
20110113055141.000|20110113055144.000|TR0|not manufacture a blood libel that serves 
20110113055144.000|20110113055147.000|TR0|only to incite the very hatred and 
20110113055147.000|20110113055150.000|TR0|violence they purport to condemn.  That is 
20110113055150.000|20110113055153.000|TR0|reprehensible.

20110113055201.000|20110113055204.000|TR0|COOPER:  Paul Begala, what did you make of 
20110113055204.000|20110113055207.000|TR0|Palin's comments?
20110113055207.000|20110113055210.000|TR0|
20110113055210.000|20110113055212.000|TR0|BEGALA:  I don't think I can say on a 
20110113055212.000|20110113055215.000|TR0|family network after a memorial service, 
20110113055215.000|20110113055218.000|TR0|Anderson.  It was -- look, you don't 
20110113055218.000|20110113055221.000|TR0|become a politician at Sarah Palin's level 
20110113055221.000|20110113055224.000|TR0|unless you have a healthy self- image.  
20110113055224.000|20110113055227.000|TR0|OK?  But this is political narcissism of 
20110113055227.000|20110113055229.000|TR0|the extreme.  She's the victim?
20110113055229.000|20110113055232.000|TR0|
20110113055232.000|20110113055235.000|TR0|Now, I watched the entire tape twice 
20110113055235.000|20110113055238.000|TR0|today, and I read it three times.  And it 
20110113055238.000|20110113055241.000|TR0|didn't get any better.  It's incredibly 
20110113055241.000|20110113055244.000|TR0|self- referential.  It does not even 
20110113055244.000|20110113055247.000|TR0|mention the names of the victims in that 
20110113055247.000|20110113055249.000|TR0|eight minutes.  It is all about Sarah and 
20110113055249.000|20110113055252.000|TR0|how she's been wronged.
20110113055252.000|20110113055255.000|TR0|
20110113055255.000|20110113055258.000|TR0|Now, perhaps she has been wronged.  But 
20110113055258.000|20110113055301.000|TR0|let me tell you, this was just not the 
20110113055301.000|20110113055304.000|TR0|sort of speech Ronald Reagan would have 
20110113055304.000|20110113055306.000|TR0|given if he had been wronged.  This was no 
20110113055306.000|20110113055309.000|TR0|rising above it.  This was no call for 
20110113055309.000|20110113055312.000|TR0|unity.  This was very bitter, very 
20110113055312.000|20110113055315.000|TR0|self-centered speech.  Just awful.
20110113055315.000|20110113055318.000|TR0|
20110113055318.000|20110113055321.000|TR0|She needs better advice.  Someone needs to 
20110113055321.000|20110113055323.000|TR0|talk to her and say, Sarah, I know this 
20110113055323.000|20110113055326.000|TR0|stinks, and I know you've been hurt and 
20110113055326.000|20110113055329.000|TR0|wronged, but you need to speak as a mom, 
20110113055329.000|20110113055332.000|TR0|the way President Obama just spoke as a 
20110113055332.000|20110113055335.000|TR0|dad.  She's a wonderful mother.  She's 
20110113055335.000|20110113055338.000|TR0|devoted to her five children.
20110113055338.000|20110113055340.000|TR0|
20110113055340.000|20110113055343.000|TR0|She should have talked about that little 
20110113055343.000|20110113055346.000|TR0|girl who was lost or the adults who lost 
20110113055346.000|20110113055349.000|TR0|their older parents, not as just a 
20110113055349.000|20110113055352.000|TR0|politician who's wounded and who's been 
20110113055352.000|20110113055355.000|TR0|sat upon by the media in the left.
20110113055355.000|20110113055357.000|TR0|
20110113055357.000|20110113055400.000|TR0|COOPER:  I want to get more reaction.  
20110113055400.000|20110113055403.000|TR0|I've been stumbling the last couple 
20110113055403.000|20110113055406.000|TR0|seconds because I've been having someone 
20110113055406.000|20110113055409.000|TR0|talk in my ear and getting e-mails.  Dana 
20110113055409.000|20110113055412.000|TR0|Bash is reporting that she's been told 
20110113055412.000|20110113055414.000|TR0|that Nancy Pelosi, Debbie Wasserman 
20110113055414.000|20110113055417.000|TR0|Schultz and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand 
20110113055417.000|20110113055420.000|TR0|were actually in the room when Giffords 
20110113055420.000|20110113055423.000|TR0|first opened her eyes.
20110113055423.000|20110113055426.000|TR0|
20110113055426.000|20110113055429.000|TR0|And Gillibrand told Dana Bash, quote, "it 
20110113055429.000|20110113055431.000|TR0|was like witnessing a miracle."
20110113055431.000|20110113055434.000|TR0|
20110113055434.000|20110113055437.000|TR0|David Gergen -- Michael Gerson, let me ask 
20110113055437.000|20110113055440.000|TR0|you, a Republican, what did make of Sarah 
20110113055440.000|20110113055443.000|TR0|Palin's comments?
20110113055443.000|20110113055446.000|TR0|
20110113055446.000|20110113055448.000|TR0|GERSON:  Well, I kind of agreed.  This is 
20110113055448.000|20110113055451.000|TR0|a case where she chose -- she was wronged 
20110113055451.000|20110113055454.000|TR0|and she chose to counterpunch.  That 
20110113055454.000|20110113055457.000|TR0|really confirms her image as a polarizing 
20110113055457.000|20110113055500.000|TR0|figure.  It doesn't change her image, 
20110113055500.000|20110113055503.000|TR0|which I think this might have been an 
20110113055503.000|20110113055506.000|TR0|opportunity to do.
20110113055506.000|20110113055508.000|TR0|
20110113055508.000|20110113055511.000|TR0|She had a set of remarks that was about 
20110113055511.000|20110113055514.000|TR0|maybe seven and a half minutes Ronald 
20110113055514.000|20110113055517.000|TR0|Reagan and 30 seconds Spiro Agnew, getting 
20110113055517.000|20110113055520.000|TR0|back at her enemies.  And, of course, 
20110113055520.000|20110113055523.000|TR0|everyone's focus is on the Spiro Agnew 
20110113055523.000|20110113055525.000|TR0|part. And I just don't think it helped her 
20110113055525.000|20110113055528.000|TR0|in any way.  It just confirmed what people 
20110113055528.000|20110113055531.000|TR0|think.
20110113055531.000|20110113055534.000|TR0|
20110113055534.000|20110113055537.000|TR0|COOPER:  We've got to take a quick break.  
20110113055537.000|20110113055540.000|TR0|More when we come back.  We'll be right 
20110113055540.000|20110113055542.000|TR0|back.
20110113055542.000|20110113055545.000|TR0|
20110113055545.000|20110113055548.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110113055548.000|20110113055551.000|TR0|
20110113055551.000|20110113055554.000|TR0|COOPER:  We're back with our panel.  David 
20110113055554.000|20110113055557.000|TR0|Gergen, what did you think of Sarah 
20110113055557.000|20110113055559.000|TR0|Palin's remarks?  Was this a missed 
20110113055559.000|20110113055602.000|TR0|opportunity for her?
20110113055602.000|20110113055605.000|TR0|
20110113055605.000|20110113055608.000|TR0|GERGEN:  I thought she made a terrible 
20110113055608.000|20110113055611.000|TR0|mistake trying to go toe to toe with 
20110113055611.000|20110113055614.000|TR0|Barack Obama on the same day.
20110113055614.000|20110113055616.000|TR0|
20110113055616.000|20110113055619.000|TR0|COOPER:  Do you think she was 
20110113055619.000|20110113055622.000|TR0|intentionally doing that?
20110113055622.000|20110113055625.000|TR0|
20110113055625.000|20110113055628.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Yes.  I think she tried to get 
20110113055628.000|20110113055631.000|TR0|out in front of the president.  And 
20110113055631.000|20110113055633.000|TR0|particularly that line that's been singled 
20110113055633.000|20110113055636.000|TR0|out, the blood libel line, you know, 
20110113055636.000|20110113055639.000|TR0|that's -- Jewish groups, of course, see 
20110113055639.000|20110113055642.000|TR0|that as anti-Semitic.  It goes back to an 
20110113055642.000|20110113055645.000|TR0|old libel that used to be used against 
20110113055645.000|20110113055648.000|TR0|Jews, who were accused of using Christian 
20110113055648.000|20110113055650.000|TR0|blood to smear their children.  And there 
20110113055650.000|20110113055653.000|TR0|are Jewish groups that have taken quite 
20110113055653.000|20110113055656.000|TR0|serious umbrage with her comment, using 
20110113055656.000|20110113055659.000|TR0|that phrase.
20110113055659.000|20110113055702.000|TR0|
20110113055702.000|20110113055705.000|TR0|I just thought it was jarring.  but I want 
20110113055705.000|20110113055707.000|TR0|to come back to something Michael Gerson 
20110113055707.000|20110113055710.000|TR0|said, because I thought it was important, 
20110113055710.000|20110113055713.000|TR0|about what the president was trying to do 
20110113055713.000|20110113055716.000|TR0|tonight.  I think the president had an 
20110113055716.000|20110113055719.000|TR0|important message and I think he was 
20110113055719.000|20110113055722.000|TR0|generally effective.  But I must say that 
20110113055722.000|20110113055725.000|TR0|by putting him into a rally like 
20110113055725.000|20110113055727.000|TR0|atmosphere --
20110113055727.000|20110113055730.000|TR0|
20110113055730.000|20110113055733.000|TR0|I disagree with Cornell.  This was not 
20110113055733.000|20110113055736.000|TR0|about whether Barack Obama has recovered 
20110113055736.000|20110113055739.000|TR0|his mojo and whether Barack Obama is back 
20110113055739.000|20110113055742.000|TR0|into his campaign capacity.  This was 
20110113055742.000|20110113055744.000|TR0|about a serious event in the nation's life 
20110113055744.000|20110113055747.000|TR0|and trying to find meaning in that event.  
20110113055747.000|20110113055750.000|TR0|And I think a quieter event might have 
20110113055750.000|20110113055753.000|TR0|been more helpful to trying to find 
20110113055753.000|20110113055756.000|TR0|meaning that everyone could join in on.
20110113055756.000|20110113055759.000|TR0|
20110113055759.000|20110113055801.000|TR0|COOPER:  It does seem, though, that -- I'm 
20110113055801.000|20110113055804.000|TR0|not sure how much control the White House 
20110113055804.000|20110113055807.000|TR0|had over this, the tenor of this event.  
20110113055807.000|20110113055810.000|TR0|From the get-go, with the -- you know, the 
20110113055810.000|20110113055813.000|TR0|professor there who gave the blessing, I 
20110113055813.000|20110113055816.000|TR0|mean, it seemed to be kind of very much 
20110113055816.000|20110113055818.000|TR0|something the University of Arizona had 
20110113055818.000|20110113055821.000|TR0|just cooked up on their own.
20110113055821.000|20110113055824.000|TR0|
20110113055824.000|20110113055827.000|TR0|BELCHER:  The thing is the president can't 
20110113055827.000|20110113055830.000|TR0|control what the people are going to do at 
20110113055830.000|20110113055833.000|TR0|-- in that venue.  Again, these people 
20110113055833.000|20110113055835.000|TR0|were -- as John pointed out, they've been 
20110113055835.000|20110113055838.000|TR0|doing some mourning.  They were ready to 
20110113055838.000|20110113055841.000|TR0|release in a rally and sort of have some 
20110113055841.000|20110113055844.000|TR0|positive energy.  I think that's what you 
20110113055844.000|20110113055847.000|TR0|saw tonight.

20110113055850.000|20110113055852.000|TR0|GERSON:  The president can put together 
20110113055852.000|20110113055855.000|TR0|any event he wishes. That's just the 
20110113055855.000|20110113055858.000|TR0|nature of the presidency.  And this was 
20110113055858.000|20110113055901.000|TR0|not a speech, by the way, that was written 
20110113055901.000|20110113055904.000|TR0|for this setting.  It didn't have applause 
20110113055904.000|20110113055907.000|TR0|lines.  Some of them were odd, where 
20110113055907.000|20110113055909.000|TR0|people applauded.  It wasn't written for 
20110113055909.000|20110113055912.000|TR0|that purpose.  There was actually a 
20110113055912.000|20110113055915.000|TR0|mismatch between the setting and the 
20110113055915.000|20110113055918.000|TR0|speech.  I don't think they expected this.

20110113055921.000|20110113055924.000|TR0|COOPER:  I think that's probably true.  We 
20110113055924.000|20110113055926.000|TR0|got to take another quick break.  Our 
20110113055926.000|20110113055929.000|TR0|coverage is going to continue all the way 
20110113055929.000|20110113055932.000|TR0|through to the 11:00 hour.  We'll be right 
20110113055932.000|20110113055935.000|TR0|back.
