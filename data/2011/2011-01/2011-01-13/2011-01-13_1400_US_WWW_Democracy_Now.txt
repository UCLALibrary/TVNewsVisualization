20110113141537.984|20110113141539.881|TR0|that we have learned from this 
20110113141539.881|20110113141541.778|TR0|great tragedy is we have come 
20110113141541.778|20110113141543.674|TR0|together. On Saturday, we all 
20110113141543.674|20110113141545.571|TR0|became Tucsonans. On Saturday, 
20110113141545.571|20110113141547.468|TR0|we all became Arizonans. And 
20110113141547.468|20110113141549.364|TR0|above all, we all became 
20110113141549.364|20110113141551.261|TR0|Americans. Despite the horrific 
20110113141551.261|20110113141553.158|TR0|actions that were taken on 
20110113141553.158|20110113141555.054|TR0|Saturday, where so many were 
20110113141555.054|20110113141556.951|TR0|lost, we saw glimmers of hope. 
20110113141556.951|20110113141558.848|TR0|These glimmers of hope come from 
20110113141558.848|20110113141600.744|TR0|people who are the real heroes. 
20110113141600.744|20110113141602.641|TR0|Although I appreciate the 
20110113141602.641|20110113141604.538|TR0|sentiment, I must humbly reject 
20110113141604.538|20110113141606.434|TR0|the use of the word "hero," 
20110113141606.434|20110113141608.331|TR0|because I am not one. The people 
20110113141608.331|20110113141610.228|TR0|that are the heroes are people 
20110113141610.228|20110113141612.124|TR0|like Pam Simon; Congresswoman 
20110113141612.124|20110113141614.021|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords; Gabe 
20110113141614.021|20110113141615.918|TR0|Zimmerman, who unfortunately we 
20110113141615.918|20110113141617.814|TR0|lost that day; Ron Barber; the 
20110113141617.814|20110113141619.711|TR0|first responders; and also 
20110113141619.711|20110113141621.608|TR0|people like Dr. Rhee, who have 
20110113141621.608|20110113141623.504|TR0|done an amazing job at making 
20110113141623.504|20110113141625.401|TR0|sure that Gabby is OK and those 
20110113141625.401|20110113141627.298|TR0|who are injured are being 
20110113141627.298|20110113141629.194|TR0|treated to the best of our 
20110113141629.194|20110113141631.091|TR0|ability.

20110113141632.988|20110113141634.884|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: In his 33-minute 
20110113141634.884|20110113141636.781|TR0|address, President Obama called 
20110113141636.781|20110113141638.678|TR0|for civil and honest public 
20110113141638.678|20110113141640.574|TR0|discourse and paid tribute to 
20110113141640.574|20110113141642.471|TR0|the victims of Saturday's 
20110113141642.471|20110113141644.368|TR0|shooting, including 
20110113141644.368|20110113141646.264|TR0|nine-year-old Christina Taylor 
20110113141646.264|20110113141648.161|TR0|Green.
20110113141648.161|20110113141650.058|TR0|
20110113141650.058|20110113141651.954|TR0|>> PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If 
20110113141651.954|20110113141653.851|TR0|this tragedy prompts reflection 
20110113141653.851|20110113141655.748|TR0|and debate, as it should, let's 
20110113141655.748|20110113141657.644|TR0|make sure it's worthy of those 
20110113141657.644|20110113141659.541|TR0|we have lost. Let's make sure 
20110113141659.541|20110113141701.438|TR0|it's not on the usual plane of 
20110113141701.438|20110113141703.334|TR0|politics and point scoring and 
20110113141703.334|20110113141705.231|TR0|pettiness that drifts away in 
20110113141705.231|20110113141707.128|TR0|the next news cycle.
20110113141707.128|20110113141709.024|TR0|
20110113141709.024|20110113141710.921|TR0|The loss of these wonderful 
20110113141710.921|20110113141712.818|TR0|people should make every one of 
20110113141712.818|20110113141714.714|TR0|us strive to be better, to be 
20110113141714.714|20110113141716.611|TR0|better in our private lives, to 
20110113141716.611|20110113141718.508|TR0|be better friends and neighbors 
20110113141718.508|20110113141720.404|TR0|and co-workers and parents. And 
20110113141720.404|20110113141722.301|TR0|if, as has been discussed in 
20110113141722.301|20110113141724.198|TR0|recent days, their death helps 
20110113141724.198|20110113141726.094|TR0|usher in more civility in our 
20110113141726.094|20110113141727.991|TR0|public discourse, let us 
20110113141727.991|20110113141729.888|TR0|remember it is not because a 
20110113141729.888|20110113141731.784|TR0|simple lack of civility caused 
20110113141731.784|20110113141733.681|TR0|this tragedy - it did not - but 
20110113141733.681|20110113141735.577|TR0|rather because only a more civil 
20110113141735.577|20110113141737.474|TR0|and honest public discourse can 
20110113141737.474|20110113141739.371|TR0|help us face up to the 
20110113141739.371|20110113141741.267|TR0|challenges of our nation, in a 
20110113141741.267|20110113141743.164|TR0|way that would make them proud. 
20110113141743.164|20110113141745.061|TR0|We should be civil because we 
20110113141745.061|20110113141746.957|TR0|want to live up to the example 
20110113141746.957|20110113141748.854|TR0|of public servants like John 
20110113141748.854|20110113141750.751|TR0|Roll and Gabby Giffords, who 
20110113141750.751|20110113141752.647|TR0|knew, first and foremost, that 
20110113141752.647|20110113141754.544|TR0|we are all Americans and that we 
20110113141754.544|20110113141756.441|TR0|can question each other's ideas 
20110113141756.441|20110113141758.337|TR0|without questioning each other's 
20110113141758.337|20110113141800.234|TR0|love of country and that our 
20110113141800.234|20110113141802.131|TR0|task, working together, is to 
20110113141802.131|20110113141804.027|TR0|constantly widen the circle of 
20110113141804.027|20110113141805.924|TR0|our concern, so that we bequeath 
20110113141805.924|20110113141807.821|TR0|the American Dream to future 
20110113141807.821|20110113141809.717|TR0|generations.
20110113141809.717|20110113141811.614|TR0|
20110113141811.614|20110113141813.511|TR0|They believed - they believed, 
20110113141813.511|20110113141815.407|TR0|and I believe, that we can be 
20110113141815.407|20110113141817.304|TR0|better. Those who died here, 
20110113141817.304|20110113141819.201|TR0|those who saved lives here, they 
20110113141819.201|20110113141821.097|TR0|help me believe. We may not be 
20110113141821.097|20110113141822.994|TR0|able to stop all evil in the 
20110113141822.994|20110113141824.891|TR0|world, but I know that how we 
20110113141824.891|20110113141826.787|TR0|treat one another, that's 
20110113141826.787|20110113141828.684|TR0|entirely up to us. And I believe 
20110113141828.684|20110113141830.581|TR0|that for all our imperfections 
20110113141830.581|20110113141832.477|TR0|we are full of decency and 
20110113141832.477|20110113141834.374|TR0|goodness and that the forces 
20110113141834.374|20110113141836.271|TR0|that divide us are not as strong 
20110113141836.271|20110113141838.167|TR0|as those that unite us. That's 
20110113141838.167|20110113141840.064|TR0|what I believe, in part because 
20110113141840.064|20110113141841.961|TR0|that's what a child like 
20110113141841.961|20110113141843.857|TR0|Christina Taylor Green believed.
20110113141843.857|20110113141845.754|TR0|
20110113141845.754|20110113141847.651|TR0|Imagine, imagine for a moment, 
20110113141847.651|20110113141849.547|TR0|here was a young girl who was 
20110113141849.547|20110113141851.444|TR0|just becoming aware of our 
20110113141851.444|20110113141853.341|TR0|democracy, just beginning to 
20110113141853.341|20110113141855.237|TR0|understand the obligations of 
20110113141855.237|20110113141857.134|TR0|citizenship, just starting to 
20110113141857.134|20110113141859.031|TR0|glimpse the fact that someday 
20110113141859.031|20110113141900.927|TR0|she too might play a part in 
20110113141900.927|20110113141902.824|TR0|shaping her nation's future. She 
20110113141902.824|20110113141904.721|TR0|had been elected to her student 
20110113141904.721|20110113141906.617|TR0|council. She saw public service 
20110113141906.617|20110113141908.514|TR0|as something exciting and 
20110113141908.514|20110113141910.411|TR0|hopeful. She was off to meet her 
20110113141910.411|20110113141912.307|TR0|congresswoman, someone she was 
20110113141912.307|20110113141914.204|TR0|sure was good and important and 
20110113141914.204|20110113141916.101|TR0|might be a role model. She saw 
20110113141916.101|20110113141917.997|TR0|all this through the eyes of a 
20110113141917.997|20110113141919.894|TR0|child, undimmed by the cynicism 
20110113141919.894|20110113141921.791|TR0|or vitriol that we adults all 
20110113141921.791|20110113141923.687|TR0|too often just take for granted. 
20110113141923.687|20110113141925.584|TR0|I want to live up to her 
20110113141925.584|20110113141927.481|TR0|expectations. I want our 
20110113141927.481|20110113141929.377|TR0|democracy to be as good as 
20110113141929.377|20110113141931.274|TR0|Christina imagined it. I want 
20110113141931.274|20110113141933.171|TR0|America to be as good as she 
20110113141933.171|20110113141935.067|TR0|imagined it. All of us, we 
20110113141935.067|20110113141936.964|TR0|should do everything we can do 
20110113141936.964|20110113141938.861|TR0|to make sure this country lives 
20110113141938.861|20110113141940.757|TR0|up to our children's 
20110113141940.757|20110113141942.654|TR0|expectations.

20110113142049.037|20110113142050.934|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We go to 
20110113142050.934|20110113142052.830|TR0|Washington, D.C. to speak with 
20110113142052.830|20110113142054.727|TR0|veteran broadcaster, 
20110113142054.727|20110113142056.624|TR0|award-winning journalist, Tavis

20110113142100.417|20110113142102.314|TR0|Tavis, welcome to Democracy Now! 
20110113142102.314|20110113142104.210|TR0|A very grim week. Your response 
20110113142104.210|20110113142106.107|TR0|to what has taken place in 
20110113142106.107|20110113142108.004|TR0|Tucson?
20110113142108.004|20110113142109.900|TR0|
20110113142109.900|20110113142111.797|TR0|>> TAVIS SMILEY: First of all, 
20110113142111.797|20110113142113.694|TR0|Amy, always a blessing to be on 
20110113142113.694|20110113142115.590|TR0|with you. Thank you for the 
20110113142115.590|20110113142117.487|TR0|opportunity.
20110113142117.487|20110113142119.384|TR0|
20110113142119.384|20110113142121.280|TR0|Clearly, I think every American 
20110113142121.280|20110113142123.177|TR0|shares in this feeling of angst, 
20110113142123.177|20110113142125.074|TR0|anger even, and certainly 
20110113142125.074|20110113142126.970|TR0|sadness about what happened in 
20110113142126.970|20110113142128.867|TR0|Arizona, and I'm so glad to see 
20110113142128.867|20110113142130.764|TR0|that the community came together 
20110113142130.764|20110113142132.660|TR0|last night. I thought the speech 
20110113142132.660|20110113142134.557|TR0|the President gave was a 
20110113142134.557|20110113142136.454|TR0|wonderful speech, and I thought 
20110113142136.454|20110113142138.350|TR0|it properly contextualized what 
20110113142138.350|20110113142140.247|TR0|it is that we are up against as 
20110113142140.247|20110113142142.144|TR0|a nation, where incivility in 
20110113142142.144|20110113142144.040|TR0|our media, in our politics, and 
20110113142144.040|20110113142145.937|TR0|life in general, where that 
20110113142145.937|20110113142147.834|TR0|incivility is concerned.
20110113142147.834|20110113142149.730|TR0|
20110113142149.730|20110113142151.627|TR0|I wish the President had gotten 
20110113142151.627|20110113142153.524|TR0|around to giving this speech a 
20110113142153.524|20110113142155.420|TR0|year ago. One of the high points 
20110113142155.420|20110113142157.317|TR0|- or I should say one of the low 
20110113142157.317|20110113142159.214|TR0|points - in incivility in this 
20110113142159.214|20110113142201.110|TR0|country was just a year or so 
20110113142201.110|20110113142203.007|TR0|ago, when Congressman Wilson 
20110113142203.007|20110113142204.904|TR0|stood up on the floor of the 
20110113142204.904|20110113142206.800|TR0|House during the President's 
20110113142206.800|20110113142208.697|TR0|speech and said, as we all 
20110113142208.697|20110113142210.594|TR0|recall, "You lie!" The President 
20110113142210.594|20110113142212.490|TR0|moved right past that and, you 
20110113142212.490|20110113142214.387|TR0|know, as he should have, 
20110113142214.387|20110113142216.284|TR0|accepted his apology, but he 
20110113142216.284|20110113142218.180|TR0|moved past it so quickly that he 
20110113142218.180|20110113142220.077|TR0|didn't take that moment to usher 
20110113142220.077|20110113142221.974|TR0|us as a nation into a 
20110113142221.974|20110113142223.870|TR0|conversation about civility. I 
20110113142223.870|20110113142225.767|TR0|wish he had done that then. I'm 
20110113142225.767|20110113142227.664|TR0|not suggesting that this tragedy 
20110113142227.664|20110113142229.560|TR0|might not have happened as a 
20110113142229.560|20110113142231.457|TR0|result of that, but we would 
20110113142231.457|20110113142233.354|TR0|already have been involved in 
20110113142233.354|20110113142235.250|TR0|this conversation about civility 
20110113142235.250|20110113142237.147|TR0|in this country, and we would 
20110113142237.147|20110113142239.044|TR0|have had a jump-start on last 
20110113142239.044|20110113142240.940|TR0|night's speech, so to speak.
20110113142240.940|20110113142242.837|TR0|
20110113142242.837|20110113142244.734|TR0|So as it turns out, the 
20110113142244.734|20110113142246.630|TR0|President, I think, gave a 
20110113142246.630|20110113142248.527|TR0|wonderful presentation last 
20110113142248.527|20110113142250.424|TR0|night, but I wish that we had 
20110113142250.424|20110113142252.320|TR0|started this conversation a year 
20110113142252.320|20110113142254.217|TR0|or so ago. And in that regard, 
20110113142254.217|20110113142256.114|TR0|we want a president that will 
20110113142256.114|20110113142258.010|TR0|lead us, not follow public 
20110113142258.010|20110113142259.907|TR0|opinion, not follow public 
20110113142259.907|20110113142301.804|TR0|sentiment. By the time the 
20110113142301.804|20110113142303.700|TR0|President got around to giving 
20110113142303.700|20110113142305.597|TR0|this presentation last night, 
20110113142305.597|20110113142307.494|TR0|for days now the country has 
20110113142307.494|20110113142309.390|TR0|been engaged on its own in this 
20110113142309.390|20110113142311.287|TR0|conversation about the lack of 
20110113142311.287|20110113142313.184|TR0|civility in our body politic. 
20110113142313.184|20110113142315.080|TR0|But again, all things 
20110113142315.080|20110113142316.977|TR0|considered, a great speech by 
20110113142316.977|20110113142318.874|TR0|the President last night. I'm 
20110113142318.874|20110113142320.770|TR0|glad he finally got around to 
20110113142320.770|20110113142322.667|TR0|giving those remarks, Amy.
20110113142322.667|20110113142324.563|TR0|
20110113142324.563|20110113142326.460|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, the event 
20110113142326.460|20110113142328.357|TR0|that you're hosting tonight, 
20110113142328.357|20110113142330.253|TR0|"America's Next Chapter," is 
20110113142330.253|20110113142332.150|TR0|certainly now taking place in a 
20110113142332.150|20110113142334.047|TR0|different context than when you 
20110113142334.047|20110113142335.943|TR0|planned it. Can you talk about 
20110113142335.943|20110113142337.840|TR0|what you see as America's next 
20110113142337.840|20110113142339.737|TR0|chapter? And I think this week 
20110113142339.737|20110113142341.633|TR0|certainly will turn a new page, 
20110113142341.633|20110113142343.530|TR0|perhaps a new chapter, write a 
20110113142343.530|20110113142345.427|TR0|new book.
20110113142345.427|20110113142347.323|TR0|
20110113142347.323|20110113142349.220|TR0|>> TAVIS SMILEY: There's no 
20110113142349.220|20110113142351.117|TR0|doubt about the fact that this 
20110113142351.117|20110113142353.013|TR0|tragedy is going to obviously 
20110113142353.013|20110113142354.910|TR0|impact the conversation that we 
20110113142354.910|20110113142356.807|TR0|had planned tonight some time 
20110113142356.807|20110113142358.703|TR0|ago. What makes this 
20110113142358.703|20110113142400.600|TR0|conversation unique - and I 
20110113142400.600|20110113142402.497|TR0|think, quite frankly, 
20110113142402.497|20110113142404.393|TR0|propitious, Amy - is that we 
20110113142404.393|20110113142406.290|TR0|rarely have conversations that 
20110113142406.290|20110113142408.187|TR0|are multicultural, multiracial, 
20110113142408.187|20110113142410.083|TR0|multiethnic and 
20110113142410.083|20110113142411.980|TR0|multi-ideological. Imagine a 
20110113142411.980|20110113142413.877|TR0|conversation that includes 
20110113142413.877|20110113142415.773|TR0|Asian, Hispanic, white, black, 
20110113142415.773|20110113142417.670|TR0|Republican, Democrat. That's 
20110113142417.670|20110113142419.567|TR0|what I have the honor to 
20110113142419.567|20110113142421.463|TR0|moderate tonight on C-SPAN live 
20110113142421.463|20110113142423.360|TR0|from 6:00 to 9:00 Eastern on the 
20110113142423.360|20110113142425.257|TR0|stage at Lisner Auditorium at 
20110113142425.257|20110113142427.153|TR0|George Washington University. 
20110113142427.153|20110113142429.050|TR0|So, as you mentioned, it's 
20110113142429.050|20110113142430.947|TR0|called "America's Next Chapter: 
20110113142430.947|20110113142432.843|TR0|Is There a Brighter Future for 
20110113142432.843|20110113142434.740|TR0|the Next Generation?"
20110113142434.740|20110113142436.637|TR0|
20110113142436.637|20110113142438.533|TR0|There was a Rasmussen Report, 
20110113142438.533|20110113142440.430|TR0|that you probably saw, that came 
20110113142440.430|20110113142442.327|TR0|out some days ago that found, 
20110113142442.327|20110113142444.223|TR0|Amy, that almost half of the 
20110113142444.223|20110113142446.120|TR0|American citizenry - almost half 
20110113142446.120|20110113142448.017|TR0|of the American public - thinks 
20110113142448.017|20110113142449.913|TR0|that our best days as a nation 
20110113142449.913|20110113142451.810|TR0|are behind us. And these kind of 
20110113142451.810|20110113142453.707|TR0|tragedies, I think, add to that 
20110113142453.707|20110113142455.603|TR0|angst, add to the reality that 
20110113142455.603|20110113142457.500|TR0|so many Americans feel about the 
20110113142457.500|20110113142459.397|TR0|fact, again, that our best days 
20110113142459.397|20110113142501.293|TR0|as a nation might very well be 
20110113142501.293|20110113142503.190|TR0|behind us. And so, this 
20110113142503.190|20110113142505.087|TR0|conversation this evening is 
20110113142505.087|20110113142506.983|TR0|designed to take this question 
20110113142506.983|20110113142508.880|TR0|head-on about how we write 
20110113142508.880|20110113142510.777|TR0|America's next chapter.
20110113142510.777|20110113142512.673|TR0|
20110113142512.673|20110113142514.570|TR0|And again, the timing could not 
20110113142514.570|20110113142516.467|TR0|be any better. This tragedy 
20110113142516.467|20110113142518.363|TR0|impacts this conversation 
20110113142518.363|20110113142520.260|TR0|tonight. A new 
20110113142520.260|20110113142522.157|TR0|Republican-controlled Congress 
20110113142522.157|20110113142524.053|TR0|impacts this conversation 
20110113142524.053|20110113142525.950|TR0|tonight. President Obama now 
20110113142525.950|20110113142527.847|TR0|almost at the halfway point of 
20110113142527.847|20110113142529.743|TR0|his first term, that impacts 
20110113142529.743|20110113142531.640|TR0|this conversation. In a few 
20110113142531.640|20110113142533.537|TR0|days, his State of the Union 
20110113142533.537|20110113142535.433|TR0|speech will impact this 
20110113142535.433|20110113142537.330|TR0|conversation. Tomorrow, I think, 
20110113142537.330|20110113142539.227|TR0|is the vote on the new chair of 
20110113142539.227|20110113142541.123|TR0|the Republican National 
20110113142541.123|20110113142543.020|TR0|Committee; the first person of 
20110113142543.020|20110113142544.917|TR0|color to head that party may be 
20110113142544.917|20110113142546.813|TR0|out tomorrow. And certainly, 
20110113142546.813|20110113142548.710|TR0|weeks from now, we're going to 
20110113142548.710|20110113142550.607|TR0|see Republicans and others start 
20110113142550.607|20110113142552.503|TR0|to line up and publicly declare 
20110113142552.503|20110113142554.400|TR0|that they're running for the 
20110113142554.400|20110113142556.297|TR0|White House a year from now. So 
20110113142556.297|20110113142558.193|TR0|the timing, again, could not be 
20110113142558.193|20110113142600.090|TR0|more propitious, and we accept 
20110113142600.090|20110113142601.987|TR0|the challenge tonight to have a 
20110113142601.987|20110113142603.883|TR0|conversation. For about three 
20110113142603.883|20110113142605.780|TR0|hours, we get a chance to really 
20110113142605.780|20110113142607.677|TR0|drill down on this subject 
20110113142607.677|20110113142609.573|TR0|matter tonight at George 
20110113142609.573|20110113142611.470|TR0|Washington University on C-SPAN.
20110113142611.470|20110113142613.366|TR0|
20110113142613.366|20110113142615.263|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Today, we would 
20110113142615.263|20110113142617.160|TR0|have been talking about the vote 
20110113142617.160|20110113142619.056|TR0|that was scheduled to take place 
20110113142619.056|20110113142620.953|TR0|yesterday in the House of 
20110113142620.953|20110113142622.850|TR0|Representatives to repeal 
20110113142622.850|20110113142624.746|TR0|Obama's healthcare plan, but the 
20110113142624.746|20110113142626.643|TR0|House has decided to put off all 
20110113142626.643|20110113142628.540|TR0|of this - all this voting until 
20110113142628.540|20110113142630.436|TR0|next week, in honor of dealing 
20110113142630.436|20110113142632.333|TR0|with what happened in Tucson. 
20110113142632.333|20110113142634.230|TR0|But I wanted to play for you, 
20110113142634.230|20110113142636.126|TR0|Tavis, what Sarah Palin had to 
20110113142636.126|20110113142638.023|TR0|say. On Wednesday, the former 
20110113142638.023|20110113142639.920|TR0|vice-presidential candidate made 
20110113142639.920|20110113142641.816|TR0|her first extended remarks about 
20110113142641.816|20110113142643.713|TR0|Saturday's shooting. Palin has 
20110113142643.713|20110113142645.610|TR0|been widely criticized for 
20110113142645.610|20110113142647.506|TR0|creating this map last year that 
20110113142647.506|20110113142649.403|TR0|placed gun crosshairs over the 
20110113142649.403|20110113142651.300|TR0|districts of 20 congressional 
20110113142651.300|20110113142653.196|TR0|districts, including Gabby 
20110113142653.196|20110113142655.093|TR0|Giffords'. She removed the map 
20110113142655.093|20110113142656.990|TR0|on Saturday after the shooting. 
20110113142656.990|20110113142658.886|TR0|Palin suggested that mention of 
20110113142658.886|20110113142700.783|TR0|her previous comments is, quote, 
20110113142700.783|20110113142702.680|TR0|"blood libel."
20110113142702.680|20110113142704.576|TR0|
20110113142704.576|20110113142706.473|TR0|>> SARAH PALIN: But especially 
20110113142706.473|20110113142708.370|TR0|within hours of a tragedy 
20110113142708.370|20110113142710.266|TR0|unfolding, journalists and 
20110113142710.266|20110113142712.163|TR0|pundits should not manufacture a 
20110113142712.163|20110113142714.060|TR0|blood libel that serves only to 
20110113142714.060|20110113142715.956|TR0|incite the very hatred and 
20110113142715.956|20110113142717.853|TR0|violence that they purport to 
20110113142717.853|20110113142719.750|TR0|condemn. That is reprehensible. 
20110113142719.750|20110113142721.646|TR0|There are those who claim 
20110113142721.646|20110113142723.543|TR0|political rhetoric is to blame 
20110113142723.543|20110113142725.440|TR0|for the despicable act of this 
20110113142725.440|20110113142727.336|TR0|deranged, apparently apolitical, 
20110113142727.336|20110113142729.233|TR0|criminal, and they claim 
20110113142729.233|20110113142731.130|TR0|political debate has somehow 
20110113142731.130|20110113142733.026|TR0|gotten more heated just 
20110113142733.026|20110113142734.923|TR0|recently. But when was it less 
20110113142734.923|20110113142736.820|TR0|heated? Back in those calm days 
20110113142736.820|20110113142738.716|TR0|when political figures literally 
20110113142738.716|20110113142740.613|TR0|settled their differences with 
20110113142740.613|20110113142742.510|TR0|dueling pistols?
20110113142742.510|20110113142744.406|TR0|
20110113142744.406|20110113142746.303|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was Sarah 
20110113142746.303|20110113142748.200|TR0|Palin. Tavis Smiley, your 
20110113142748.200|20110113142750.096|TR0|response?
20110113142750.096|20110113142751.993|TR0|
20110113142751.993|20110113142753.890|TR0|>> TAVIS SMILEY: Well, it's easy 
20110113142753.890|20110113142755.786|TR0|to Monday morning quarterback. 
20110113142755.786|20110113142757.683|TR0|It's easy now to take that image 
20110113142757.683|20110113142759.580|TR0|down off your website. It's easy 
20110113142759.580|20110113142801.476|TR0|now to blame the media in this 
20110113142801.476|20110113142803.373|TR0|regard. I think, quite frankly, 
20110113142803.373|20110113142805.270|TR0|Sarah Palin gets far too much 
20110113142805.270|20110113142807.166|TR0|media attention in the first 
20110113142807.166|20110113142809.063|TR0|place. I never waste time on my 
20110113142809.063|20110113142810.960|TR0|show discussing Sarah Palin - TV 
20110113142810.960|20110113142812.856|TR0|or radio. And I'm glad you 
20110113142812.856|20110113142814.753|TR0|played the clip; I'm not saying 
20110113142814.753|20110113142816.650|TR0|that to cast aspersion on you in 
20110113142816.650|20110113142818.546|TR0|this moment. In this moment, 
20110113142818.546|20110113142820.443|TR0|that is, Sarah Palin ought to be 
20110113142820.443|20110113142822.340|TR0|wrestled with. But she gets so 
20110113142822.340|20110113142824.236|TR0|much more attention than she 
20110113142824.236|20110113142826.133|TR0|absolutely deserves on our 
20110113142826.133|20110113142828.030|TR0|national media, for reasons I 
20110113142828.030|20110113142829.926|TR0|quite frankly don't understand. 
20110113142829.926|20110113142831.823|TR0|I don't take her seriously as a 
20110113142831.823|20110113142833.720|TR0|candidate, don't take her 
20110113142833.720|20110113142835.616|TR0|pronouncements seriously. And 
20110113142835.616|20110113142837.513|TR0|this is really all about a 
20110113142837.513|20110113142839.410|TR0|branding effort for Sarah Palin, 
20110113142839.410|20110113142841.306|TR0|and she's making a lot of money 
20110113142841.306|20110113142843.203|TR0|doing it. I ain't mad at her for 
20110113142843.203|20110113142845.100|TR0|that. American enterprise is 
20110113142845.100|20110113142846.996|TR0|thriving in this country; she's 
20110113142846.996|20110113142848.893|TR0|taking full advantage of it.
20110113142848.893|20110113142850.790|TR0|
20110113142850.790|20110113142852.686|TR0|Having said that, let's wrestle 
20110113142852.686|20110113142854.583|TR0|with those comments right now 
20110113142854.583|20110113142856.480|TR0|for a second. I believe that 
20110113142856.480|20110113142858.376|TR0|Sarah Palin, again, takes the 
20110113142858.376|20110113142900.273|TR0|easy way out by simply blaming 
20110113142900.273|20110113142902.170|TR0|the media. There's so much blame 
20110113142902.170|20110113142904.066|TR0|to go around here, starting with 
20110113142904.066|20110113142905.963|TR0|our elected officials. And I 
20110113142905.963|20110113142907.859|TR0|mean Democrats and Republicans. 
20110113142907.859|20110113142909.756|TR0|We could do this all day long. 
20110113142909.756|20110113142911.653|TR0|Dick Cheney, when he stands on 
20110113142911.653|20110113142913.549|TR0|the floor of the Senate and says 
20110113142913.549|20110113142915.446|TR0|to Democratic Senator Patrick 
20110113142915.446|20110113142917.343|TR0|Leahy of Vermont, we all 
20110113142917.343|20110113142919.239|TR0|famously recall, "Go 'F' 
20110113142919.239|20110113142921.136|TR0|yourself" - that's the sitting 
20110113142921.136|20110113142923.033|TR0|vice president of this country 
20110113142923.033|20110113142924.929|TR0|at that time telling a United 
20110113142924.929|20110113142926.826|TR0|States senator, a committee 
20110113142926.826|20110113142928.723|TR0|chair, to "go 'F' yourself." 
20110113142928.723|20110113142930.619|TR0|President Obama, on one of his 
20110113142930.619|20110113142932.516|TR0|interviews within the last year, 
20110113142932.516|20110113142934.413|TR0|said to a reporter that he wants 
20110113142934.413|20110113142936.309|TR0|to know whose "A" to kick. 
20110113142936.309|20110113142938.206|TR0|That's the President, in a live 
20110113142938.206|20110113142940.103|TR0|interview, saying, "I want to 
20110113142940.103|20110113142941.999|TR0|know whose 'A' to go kick," 
20110113142941.999|20110113142943.896|TR0|inside his own administration. I 
20110113142943.896|20110113142945.793|TR0|think that kind of language 
20110113142945.793|20110113142947.689|TR0|doesn't add to civility in this 
20110113142947.689|20110113142949.586|TR0|country, Republican and Democrat.
20110113142949.586|20110113142951.483|TR0|
20110113142951.483|20110113142953.379|TR0|The media certainly has a role 
20110113142953.379|20110113142955.276|TR0|to play in this. You can watch 
20110113142955.276|20110113142957.173|TR0|Fox News on any given night and 
20110113142957.173|20110113142959.069|TR0|listen to vitriol in their 
20110113142959.069|20110113143000.966|TR0|attack of MSNBC. And you can 
20110113143000.966|20110113143002.863|TR0|flip the channel and watch MSNBC 
20110113143002.863|20110113143004.759|TR0|with even more vitriol attacking 
20110113143004.759|20110113143006.656|TR0|Fox News. And CNN is caught in 
20110113143006.656|20110113143008.553|TR0|the middle trying to figure it 
20110113143008.553|20110113143010.449|TR0|all out.
20110113143010.449|20110113143012.346|TR0|
20110113143012.346|20110113143014.243|TR0|But worse yet, the American 
20110113143014.243|20110113143016.139|TR0|people. I believe, Amy, that 
20110113143016.139|20110113143018.036|TR0|hate is spreading fastest in 
20110113143018.036|20110113143019.933|TR0|this country on the internet. 
20110113143019.933|20110113143021.829|TR0|And there are no civility 
20110113143021.829|20110113143023.726|TR0|police. There are no fact 
20110113143023.726|20110113143025.623|TR0|checkers. You can say anything. 
20110113143025.623|20110113143027.519|TR0|You can put anything out there. 
20110113143027.519|20110113143029.416|TR0|You can do it anonymously; you 
20110113143029.416|20110113143031.313|TR0|can be cowardly about it.
20110113143031.313|20110113143033.209|TR0|

20110113143245.976|20110113143247.872|TR0|in that sense, it's his most 
20110113143247.872|20110113143249.769|TR0|important. That we are

20110113143312.529|20110113143314.426|TR0|Indeed, their questions suggest 
20110113143314.426|20110113143316.322|TR0|that they do not know the world

20110113143536.675|20110113143538.572|TR0|human beings with napalm, of 
20110113143538.572|20110113143540.469|TR0|filling our nation's homes with 
20110113143540.469|20110113143542.365|TR0|orphans and widows, of injecting 
20110113143542.365|20110113143544.262|TR0|poisonous drugs of hate into 
20110113143544.262|20110113143546.159|TR0|veins of peoples normally 
20110113143546.159|20110113143548.055|TR0|humane, of sending men home from

20110113143549.952|20110113143551.849|TR0|physically handicapped and

20110113143553.745|20110113143555.642|TR0|be reconciled with wisdom, 
20110113143555.642|20110113143557.539|TR0|justice and love. A nation that 
20110113143557.539|20110113143559.435|TR0|continues year after year to 
20110113143559.435|20110113143601.332|TR0|spend more money on military

20110113143616.505|20110113143618.402|TR0|nothing, except a tragic death 
20110113143618.402|20110113143620.299|TR0|wish, to prevent us from

20110113143631.679|20110113143633.575|TR0|you would reflect on this less 
20110113143633.575|20110113143635.472|TR0|famous speech of Dr. King, not 
20110113143635.472|20110113143637.369|TR0|the "I Have a Dream" speech, but 
20110113143637.369|20110113143639.265|TR0|that speech he gave even against 
20110113143639.265|20110113143641.162|TR0|the advice of his inner circle, 
20110113143641.162|20110113143643.059|TR0|who said, "You will the support 
20110113143643.059|20110113143644.955|TR0|of the leadership in America 
20110113143644.955|20110113143646.852|TR0|that is supporting you on civil 
20110113143646.852|20110113143648.749|TR0|rights," when he said, "I must 
20110113143648.749|20110113143650.645|TR0|deal with violence abroad, as 
20110113143650.645|20110113143652.542|TR0|well as violence at home."

20110113143654.439|20110113143656.335|TR0|>> TAVIS SMILEY: And Amy, as you 
20110113143656.335|20110113143658.232|TR0|well know, he did. When King was 
20110113143658.232|20110113143700.129|TR0|gunned down on that balcony in 
20110113143700.129|20110113143702.025|TR0|Memphis a year to the day later, 
20110113143702.025|20110113143703.922|TR0|as you mentioned, after that 
20110113143703.922|20110113143705.819|TR0|speech, he was persona non grata 
20110113143705.819|20110113143707.715|TR0|in this country. Over 55 percent 
20110113143707.715|20110113143709.612|TR0|of black Americans had turned 
20110113143709.612|20110113143711.509|TR0|against their leader, Dr. King. 
20110113143711.509|20110113143713.405|TR0|Three-quarters of the American 
20110113143713.405|20110113143715.302|TR0|people - three-quarters of the 
20110113143715.302|20110113143717.199|TR0|American people - had turned 
20110113143717.199|20110113143719.095|TR0|against Dr. King. He was no 
20110113143719.095|20110113143720.992|TR0|longer on the list of the most 
20110113143720.992|20110113143722.889|TR0|admired Americans. So King dies, 
20110113143722.889|20110113143724.785|TR0|again, persona non grata on that 
20110113143724.785|20110113143726.682|TR0|balcony in Memphis.
20110113143726.682|20110113143728.579|TR0|
20110113143728.579|20110113143730.475|TR0|Here we are now, days away from 
20110113143730.475|20110113143732.372|TR0|his actual birthday, January the 
20110113143732.372|20110113143734.269|TR0|15th, days away from his holiday 
20110113143734.269|20110113143736.165|TR0|- and this year, as you know, is 
20110113143736.165|20110113143738.062|TR0|the 25th anniversary of the King 
20110113143738.062|20110113143739.959|TR0|holiday, that Ronald Reagan was 
20110113143739.959|20110113143741.855|TR0|forced to sign into law. He 
20110113143741.855|20110113143743.752|TR0|didn't want to do it, had to do 
20110113143743.752|20110113143745.648|TR0|it, during his term in the White 
20110113143745.648|20110113143747.545|TR0|House - terms in the White 
20110113143747.545|20110113143749.442|TR0|House. When you hear that 
20110113143749.442|20110113143751.338|TR0|speech, it's hard to even add 
20110113143751.338|20110113143753.235|TR0|anything more to it, because, at 
20110113143753.235|20110113143755.132|TR0|once, you see how courageous he 
20110113143755.132|20110113143757.028|TR0|was and how principled he was. 
20110113143757.028|20110113143758.925|TR0|It's why, to this day, I regard 
20110113143758.925|20110113143800.822|TR0|Dr. King as the greatest 
20110113143800.822|20110113143802.718|TR0|American we have ever produced. 
20110113143802.718|20110113143804.615|TR0|I could argue with you on FDR, I 
20110113143804.615|20110113143806.512|TR0|could argue with you about 
20110113143806.512|20110113143808.408|TR0|Lincoln, but I regard Dr. King 
20110113143808.408|20110113143810.305|TR0|as the greatest American we've 
20110113143810.305|20110113143812.202|TR0|ever produced, because of his 
20110113143812.202|20110113143814.098|TR0|courage, because of his 
20110113143814.098|20110113143815.995|TR0|conviction, because of his 
20110113143815.995|20110113143817.892|TR0|commitment, because he was a 
20110113143817.892|20110113143819.788|TR0|truth teller. His life, in 
20110113143819.788|20110113143821.685|TR0|short, was about this: justice 
20110113143821.685|20110113143823.582|TR0|for all, service to others, and 
20110113143823.582|20110113143825.478|TR0|a love that liberates people. 
20110113143825.478|20110113143827.375|TR0|Justice for all, service to 
20110113143827.375|20110113143829.272|TR0|others, and a love that 
20110113143829.272|20110113143831.168|TR0|liberates people.

20110113143833.065|20110113143834.962|TR0|In that last clip you played, 
20110113143834.962|20110113143836.858|TR0|King talked about a revolution 
20110113143836.858|20110113143838.755|TR0|of values. How prophetic was he? 
20110113143838.755|20110113143840.652|TR0|How propitious is that call 
20110113143840.652|20110113143842.548|TR0|right now in this nation for a 
20110113143842.548|20110113143844.445|TR0|revolution of our values? And 
20110113143844.445|20110113143846.342|TR0|that's why I celebrate what you 
20110113143846.342|20110113143848.238|TR0|do, Amy, on this program every 
20110113143848.238|20110113143850.135|TR0|day. You are, in the Kingian 
20110113143850.135|20110113143852.032|TR0|tradition, the most, I think, 
20110113143852.032|20110113143853.928|TR0|courageous voice on TV, the most 
20110113143853.928|20110113143855.825|TR0|courageous voice on radio, 
20110113143855.825|20110113143857.722|TR0|raising these progressive 
20110113143857.722|20110113143859.618|TR0|questions, challenging us to

20110113144032.555|20110113144034.451|TR0|saying this against the backdrop 
20110113144034.451|20110113144036.348|TR0|of the U.S. bombing of 
20110113144036.348|20110113144038.245|TR0|Yugoslavia. And now you look at 
20110113144038.245|20110113144040.141|TR0|today, the same message to the 
20110113144040.141|20110113144042.038|TR0|young people of this country - 
20110113144042.038|20110113144043.935|TR0|violence is not the answer - 
20110113144043.935|20110113144045.831|TR0|against the backdrop of war. 
20110113144045.831|20110113144047.728|TR0|Your final comment, Tavis?
20110113144047.728|20110113144049.625|TR0|
20110113144049.625|20110113144051.521|TR0|>> TAVIS SMILEY: That's why I 
20110113144051.521|20110113144053.418|TR0|said a moment ago I celebrate 
20110113144053.418|20110113144055.315|TR0|your voice and your courage in 
20110113144055.315|20110113144057.211|TR0|raising these issues, again, to 
20110113144057.211|20110113144059.108|TR0|help us reexamine the 
20110113144059.108|20110113144101.005|TR0|assumptions we hold, helping us 
20110113144101.005|20110113144102.901|TR0|to expand our inventory of ideas 
20110113144102.901|20110113144104.798|TR0|and to look at the world through 
20110113144104.798|20110113144106.695|TR0|a different prism, to create a 
20110113144106.695|20110113144108.591|TR0|different worldview. It's what 
20110113144108.591|20110113144110.488|TR0|this conversation tonight at 
20110113144110.488|20110113144112.385|TR0|George Washington University on 
20110113144112.385|20110113144114.281|TR0|C-SPAN is all about, trying to 
20110113144114.281|20110113144116.178|TR0|get us to wrestle with these 
20110113144116.178|20110113144118.075|TR0|critical questions. And 
20110113144118.075|20110113144119.971|TR0|presidents have to be held 
20110113144119.971|20110113144121.868|TR0|accountable. They are examples, 
20110113144121.868|20110113144123.765|TR0|too, and the hypocrisy so often 
20110113144123.765|20110113144125.661|TR0|has to be called out. And 
20110113144125.661|20110113144127.558|TR0|somebody has to have the 
20110113144127.558|20110113144129.455|TR0|capacity, the courage, to do 
20110113144129.455|20110113144131.351|TR0|just that.
20110113144131.351|20110113144133.248|TR0|
20110113144133.248|20110113144135.145|TR0|My grandfather used to say all 
20110113144135.145|20110113144137.041|TR0|the time, "Tavis, so often, when 
20110113144137.041|20110113144138.938|TR0|all is said and done, more has 
20110113144138.938|20110113144140.835|TR0|been said than done. We've got 
20110113144140.835|20110113144142.731|TR0|to move beyond saying and not 
20110113144142.731|20110113144144.628|TR0|doing. We have to be compassion. 
20110113144144.628|20110113144146.525|TR0|We have to be love. We have to 
20110113144146.525|20110113144148.421|TR0|be kindness. We have to be those 
20110113144148.421|20110113144150.318|TR0|things that we want to see in 
20110113144150.318|20110113144152.215|TR0|the world." And it's just 
20110113144152.215|20110113144154.111|TR0|amazing to hear that clip from 
20110113144154.111|20110113144156.008|TR0|years ago and what we saw, heard 
20110113144156.008|20110113144157.905|TR0|last night - different time, 
20110113144157.905|20110113144159.801|TR0|different moment, but almost 
20110113144159.801|20110113144201.698|TR0|redux. And so, it's got to be 
20110113144201.698|20110113144203.595|TR0|more than just about the words 
20110113144203.595|20110113144205.491|TR0|that we speak, but rather the 
20110113144205.491|20110113144207.388|TR0|deeds that we do.

20110113144233.941|20110113144235.838|TR0|the latest in the Obama 
20110113144235.838|20110113144237.735|TR0|administration's crackdown on 
20110113144237.735|20110113144239.631|TR0|the whistleblower group 
20110113144239.631|20110113144241.528|TR0|WikiLeaks. Last week, it was 
20110113144241.528|20110113144243.425|TR0|revealed the Justice Department 
20110113144243.425|20110113144245.321|TR0|has subpoenaed the internet 
20110113144245.321|20110113144247.218|TR0|company Twitter for personal 
20110113144247.218|20110113144249.115|TR0|information from several people 
20110113144249.115|20110113144251.011|TR0|linked to WikiLeaks, including 
20110113144251.011|20110113144252.908|TR0|its founder, Julian Assange.

20110113144254.805|20110113144256.701|TR0|The subpoena asks Twitter for 
20110113144256.701|20110113144258.598|TR0|all records and correspondence 
20110113144258.598|20110113144300.495|TR0|relating to their accounts, 
20110113144300.495|20110113144302.391|TR0|including apparently private 
20110113144302.391|20110113144304.288|TR0|direct messages sent through 
20110113144304.288|20110113144306.185|TR0|Twitter. The subpoena was issued 
20110113144306.185|20110113144308.081|TR0|on December 14th, but Twitter 
20110113144308.081|20110113144309.978|TR0|was under a gag order until last 
20110113144309.978|20110113144311.875|TR0|week. It's unclear if Facebook 
20110113144311.875|20110113144313.771|TR0|or any other internet companies 
20110113144313.771|20110113144315.668|TR0|have received similar subpoenas.

20110113144327.048|20110113144328.944|TR0|arrested in May on suspicion of 
20110113144328.944|20110113144330.841|TR0|leaking classified material to 
20110113144330.841|20110113144332.738|TR0|WikiLeaks and remains in

20110113144338.428|20110113144340.324|TR0|Birgitta Jonsdottir, a member of 
20110113144340.324|20110113144342.221|TR0|the Icelandic parliament. She 
20110113144342.221|20110113144344.118|TR0|collaborated with WikiLeaks, 
20110113144344.118|20110113144346.014|TR0|including on its release of 
20110113144346.014|20110113144347.911|TR0|classified U.S. military video 
20110113144347.911|20110113144349.808|TR0|footage of the deadly helicopter 
20110113144349.808|20110113144351.704|TR0|attack on Iraqi civilians that 
20110113144351.704|20110113144353.601|TR0|took place on July 12th, 2007.

20110113144355.498|20110113144357.394|TR0|She arrived in Canada this week, 
20110113144357.394|20110113144359.291|TR0|and she joined me via Skype from 
20110113144359.291|20110113144401.188|TR0|Toronto for an interview. I 
20110113144401.188|20110113144403.084|TR0|began by asking her how she 
20110113144403.084|20110113144404.981|TR0|first found out about the 
20110113144404.981|20110113144406.878|TR0|subpoena.

20110113144408.774|20110113144410.671|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: I got 
20110113144410.671|20110113144412.568|TR0|this subpoena with - asking for 
20110113144412.568|20110113144414.464|TR0|all this extra information, not 
20110113144414.464|20110113144416.361|TR0|only my tweets. Of course, I 
20110113144416.361|20110113144418.258|TR0|don't care if they have access 
20110113144418.258|20110113144420.154|TR0|to my tweets; it's public. I 
20110113144420.154|20110113144422.051|TR0|just find it disturbing that 
20110113144422.051|20110113144423.948|TR0|they are asking for all the 
20110113144423.948|20110113144425.844|TR0|other information and that 
20110113144425.844|20110113144427.741|TR0|they're doing this under gag 
20110113144427.741|20110113144429.638|TR0|order. And I'm not familiar with 
20110113144429.638|20110113144431.534|TR0|the U.S. law, but I think it is 
20110113144431.534|20110113144433.431|TR0|possible because of the 
20110113144433.431|20110113144435.328|TR0|terrorist law or increased 
20110113144435.328|20110113144437.224|TR0|legislations to spy on citizens 
20110113144437.224|20110113144439.121|TR0|in the United States because of 
20110113144439.121|20110113144441.018|TR0|9/11. And I also am concerned 
20110113144441.018|20110113144442.914|TR0|about all the other social 
20110113144442.914|20110113144444.811|TR0|media, including Google Mail and 
20110113144444.811|20110113144446.708|TR0|so forth. And I find it to be 
20110113144446.708|20110113144448.604|TR0|important to stand firm against 
20110113144448.604|20110113144450.501|TR0|simply handing over this 
20110113144450.501|20110113144452.398|TR0|information, not just for me, 
20110113144452.398|20110113144454.294|TR0|but for everybody else that uses 
20110113144454.294|20110113144456.191|TR0|these social services.

20110113144503.778|20110113144505.674|TR0|touch with you?

20110113144507.571|20110113144509.468|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: Well, 
20110113144509.468|20110113144511.364|TR0|they didn't. I got a letter from 
20110113144511.364|20110113144513.261|TR0|Twitter, where they notified me 
20110113144513.261|20110113144515.158|TR0|and the others about the fact 
20110113144515.158|20110113144517.054|TR0|that they had been requested to 
20110113144517.054|20110113144518.951|TR0|hand over this information and 
20110113144518.951|20110113144520.848|TR0|that they had managed to unseal 
20110113144520.848|20110113144522.744|TR0|the sealed document. If they 
20110113144522.744|20110113144524.641|TR0|would have done as U.S. 
20110113144524.641|20110113144526.538|TR0|authorities requested them to 
20110113144526.538|20110113144528.434|TR0|do, to hand this over within 
20110113144528.434|20110113144530.331|TR0|three days without letting us 
20110113144530.331|20110113144532.228|TR0|know, then obviously I would not 
20110113144532.228|20110113144534.124|TR0|be talking about this right now 
20110113144534.124|20110113144536.021|TR0|and would not have had any 
20110113144536.021|20110113144537.918|TR0|opportunity to defend myself.

20110113144539.814|20110113144541.711|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What does it 
20110113144541.711|20110113144543.608|TR0|mean that the U.S. is 
20110113144543.608|20110113144545.504|TR0|subpoenaing information of an 
20110113144545.504|20110113144547.401|TR0|Icelandic member of parliament, 
20110113144547.401|20110113144549.298|TR0|Birgitta?
20110113144549.298|20110113144551.194|TR0|
20110113144551.194|20110113144553.091|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: Well, I 
20110113144553.091|20110113144554.988|TR0|think that opens up a whole can 
20110113144554.988|20110113144556.884|TR0|of worms when it comes to 
20110113144556.884|20110113144558.781|TR0|parliamentary immunity 
20110113144558.781|20110113144600.678|TR0|worldwide. And that's why 
20110113144600.678|20110113144602.574|TR0|Icelandic authorities are taking 
20110113144602.574|20110113144604.471|TR0|this very seriously. And the 
20110113144604.471|20110113144606.368|TR0|foreign affairs minister and the 
20110113144606.368|20110113144608.264|TR0|justice minister have both said 
20110113144608.264|20110113144610.161|TR0|that they are concerned about 
20110113144610.161|20110113144612.058|TR0|this and are looking into this. 
20110113144612.058|20110113144613.954|TR0|And the president of the 
20110113144613.954|20110113144615.851|TR0|Icelandic parliament, equivalent 
20110113144615.851|20110113144617.748|TR0|to the speaker of the House, is 
20110113144617.748|20110113144619.644|TR0|looking into the legalities 
20110113144619.644|20110113144621.541|TR0|around this issue.
20110113144621.541|20110113144623.437|TR0|
20110113144623.437|20110113144625.334|TR0|And let's just turn the tables 
20110113144625.334|20110113144627.231|TR0|around, and like, currently 
20110113144627.231|20110113144629.127|TR0|there's an investigation into 
20110113144629.127|20110113144631.024|TR0|how Iceland became a part of the 
20110113144631.024|20110113144632.921|TR0|Coalition of the Willing for the 
20110113144632.921|20110113144634.817|TR0|Iraqi war, and there's an 
20110113144634.817|20110113144636.714|TR0|investigation in our parliament. 
20110113144636.714|20110113144638.611|TR0|Let's say that I would like to 
20110113144638.611|20110113144640.507|TR0|get the information from all 
20110113144640.507|20110113144642.404|TR0|members of the Foreign Affairs 
20110113144642.404|20110113144644.301|TR0|Committee in the U.S. Senate in 
20110113144644.301|20110113144646.197|TR0|relation to their knowledge 
20110113144646.197|20110113144648.094|TR0|about war crimes in Iraq. Would 
20110113144648.094|20110113144649.991|TR0|the U.S. authorities feel 
20110113144649.991|20110113144651.887|TR0|comfortable with that? Let's say 
20110113144651.887|20110113144653.784|TR0|every member of parliament that 
20110113144653.784|20110113144655.681|TR0|has ever fought for Tibet or 
20110113144655.681|20110113144657.577|TR0|Taiwan or other countries that 
20110113144657.577|20110113144659.474|TR0|China is not happy about, would 
20110113144659.474|20110113144701.371|TR0|the rest of the, like, let's 
20110113144701.371|20110113144703.267|TR0|say, the United States 
20110113144703.267|20110113144705.164|TR0|parliamentarians be happy if 
20110113144705.164|20110113144707.061|TR0|China would order, have similar 
20110113144707.061|20110113144708.957|TR0|orders on their privacy?
20110113144708.957|20110113144710.854|TR0|
20110113144710.854|20110113144712.751|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20110113144712.751|20110113144714.647|TR0|about what Twitter did? They 
20110113144714.647|20110113144716.544|TR0|challenged the gag order in 
20110113144716.544|20110113144718.441|TR0|court. Then they told the 
20110113144718.441|20110113144720.337|TR0|targets, among them, you, 
20110113144720.337|20110113144722.234|TR0|Birgitta Jonsdottir, that their 
20110113144722.234|20110113144724.131|TR0|data was being requested, giving 
20110113144724.131|20110113144726.027|TR0|you a chance to try and quash 
20110113144726.027|20110113144727.924|TR0|the order yourself. But, so what 
20110113144727.924|20110113144729.821|TR0|has Twitter done at this point? 
20110113144729.821|20110113144731.717|TR0|They've told you.

20110113144735.511|20110113144737.407|TR0|told me Friday. I got a letter 
20110113144737.407|20110113144739.304|TR0|from them Friday, last Friday, 
20110113144739.304|20110113144741.201|TR0|that I had 10 days to do 
20110113144741.201|20110113144743.097|TR0|something about this. And they 
20110113144743.097|20110113144744.994|TR0|also suggested that I would be 
20110113144744.994|20110113144746.891|TR0|in touch with EFF and other 
20110113144746.891|20110113144748.787|TR0|similar organizations.

20110113144758.271|20110113144800.167|TR0|which I did. I actually have to 
20110113144800.167|20110113144802.064|TR0|say that I'm quite happy with 
20110113144802.064|20110113144803.961|TR0|how Twitter handled this. And I 
20110113144803.961|20110113144805.857|TR0|certainly hope - I haven't 
20110113144805.857|20110113144807.754|TR0|gotten any letters from the 
20110113144807.754|20110113144809.651|TR0|other social media that I use. I 
20110113144809.651|20110113144811.547|TR0|certainly hope that they have, 
20110113144811.547|20110113144813.444|TR0|if they have gotten similar 
20110113144813.444|20110113144815.341|TR0|subpoenas, stood firm like

20110113144830.514|20110113144832.411|TR0|to know. And that's one of the 
20110113144832.411|20110113144834.307|TR0|things that I will be looking 
20110113144834.307|20110113144836.204|TR0|into getting information about 
20110113144836.204|20110113144838.101|TR0|through my lawyers.

20110113144841.894|20110113144843.791|TR0|Jonsdottir, can you talk about 
20110113144843.791|20110113144845.687|TR0|your involvement in WikiLeaks, 
20110113144845.687|20110113144847.584|TR0|how you got involved, what 
20110113144847.584|20110113144849.481|TR0|you've done?
20110113144849.481|20110113144851.377|TR0|
20110113144851.377|20110113144853.274|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: Well, 
20110113144853.274|20110113144855.171|TR0|I've always been an activist, 
20110113144855.171|20110113144857.067|TR0|and I did fight very hard to try 
20110113144857.067|20110113144858.964|TR0|to stop the war in Iraq by 
20110113144858.964|20110113144900.861|TR0|organizing big protests in 
20110113144900.861|20110113144902.757|TR0|Iceland with others. And I did 
20110113144902.757|20110113144904.654|TR0|protest when I heard what was 
20110113144904.654|20110113144906.551|TR0|going on in Fallujah and so 
20110113144906.551|20110113144908.447|TR0|forth. So when I saw this video 
20110113144908.447|20110113144910.344|TR0|- Julian Assange showed it to me 
20110113144910.344|20110113144912.240|TR0|while he was in Iceland in March 
20110113144912.240|20110113144914.137|TR0|- I felt compelled to do 
20110113144914.137|20110113144916.034|TR0|everything I could do to help 
20110113144916.034|20110113144917.930|TR0|with it. So I both put my name 
20110113144917.930|20110113144919.827|TR0|on it as a co-producer, and I 
20110113144919.827|20110113144921.724|TR0|did a lot of research work. I 
20110113144921.724|20110113144923.620|TR0|coordinated volunteers in 
20110113144923.620|20110113144925.517|TR0|Iceland and basically did 
20110113144925.517|20110113144927.414|TR0|whatever I needed to do in order 
20110113144927.414|20110113144929.310|TR0|to make the deadline that we had 
20110113144929.310|20110113144931.207|TR0|set to make it noticed by 
20110113144931.207|20110113144933.104|TR0|collaborating with mainstream 
20110113144933.104|20110113144935.000|TR0|media, Icelandic State 
20110113144935.000|20110113144936.897|TR0|Television, and sent some people 
20110113144936.897|20110113144938.794|TR0|from there - Christian Hrafnsson 
20110113144938.794|20110113144940.690|TR0|and his assistant - to do - look 
20110113144940.690|20110113144942.587|TR0|into if they could find, for 
20110113144942.587|20110113144944.484|TR0|example, the children, which 
20110113144944.484|20110113144946.380|TR0|they found.
20110113144946.380|20110113144948.277|TR0|
20110113144948.277|20110113144950.174|TR0|And then I have also acted as a 
20110113144950.174|20110113144952.070|TR0|spokesperson for WikiLeaks, and 
20110113144952.070|20110113144953.967|TR0|particularly for "Collateral 
20110113144953.967|20110113144955.864|TR0|Murder" and also when Julian 
20110113144955.864|20110113144957.760|TR0|Assange and the rest of us heard 
20110113144957.760|20110113144959.657|TR0|in the news that Bradley Manning 
20110113144959.657|20110113145001.554|TR0|had been arrested and on the 
20110113145001.554|20110113145003.450|TR0|grounds that he had leaked 
20110113145003.450|20110113145005.347|TR0|something for WikiLeaks. So, 
20110113145005.347|20110113145007.244|TR0|Julian went undercover in 
20110113145007.244|20110113145009.140|TR0|Australia, and I offered to act 
20110113145009.140|20110113145011.037|TR0|as a spokesperson while he could 
20110113145011.037|20110113145012.934|TR0|not do it himself.
20110113145012.934|20110113145014.830|TR0|
20110113145014.830|20110113145016.727|TR0|And I support websites like 
20110113145016.727|20110113145018.624|TR0|WikiLeaks, and I support 
20110113145018.624|20110113145020.520|TR0|whistleblowers. And I think it's 
20110113145020.520|20110113145022.417|TR0|important to have strong 
20110113145022.417|20110113145024.314|TR0|legislation for sources. And I 
20110113145024.314|20110113145026.210|TR0|find it to be appalling that 
20110113145026.210|20110113145028.107|TR0|what the U.S. authorities and 
20110113145028.107|20110113145030.004|TR0|others, that obviously fear that 
20110113145030.004|20110113145031.900|TR0|their information is going to be 
20110113145031.900|20110113145033.797|TR0|made available to the people 
20110113145033.797|20110113145035.694|TR0|that should have access to it, 
20110113145035.694|20110113145037.590|TR0|are trying to criminalize 
20110113145037.590|20110113145039.487|TR0|whistleblowers, and they're 
20110113145039.487|20110113145041.384|TR0|trying to criminalize those that 
20110113145041.384|20110113145043.280|TR0|make their material accessible 
20110113145043.280|20110113145045.177|TR0|for the rest of us.
20110113145045.177|20110113145047.074|TR0|
20110113145047.074|20110113145048.970|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Just to clarify 
20110113145048.970|20110113145050.867|TR0|the significance of this 
20110113145050.867|20110113145052.764|TR0|videotape, which Democracy Now! 
20110113145052.764|20110113145054.660|TR0|played also last spring, the 
20110113145054.660|20110113145056.557|TR0|release of the videotape of July 
20110113145056.557|20110113145058.454|TR0|12th, 2007, that showed a U.S. 
20110113145058.454|20110113145100.350|TR0|Apache helicopter, it was taken 
20110113145100.350|20110113145102.247|TR0|by the military from the 
20110113145102.247|20110113145104.144|TR0|helicopter, targeting a group of 
20110113145104.144|20110113145106.040|TR0|Iraqis below. Two of them worked 
20110113145106.040|20110113145107.937|TR0|for Reuters, and they were being 
20110113145107.937|20110113145109.834|TR0|taken around by people in the 
20110113145109.834|20110113145111.730|TR0|community in New Baghdad in 
20110113145111.730|20110113145113.627|TR0|Iraq. And they opened fire on 
20110113145113.627|20110113145115.524|TR0|them, and they killed Namir 
20110113145115.524|20110113145117.420|TR0|Noor-Eldeen, as well as Saeed 
20110113145117.420|20110113145119.317|TR0|Chmagh, his driver, the two 
20110113145119.317|20110113145121.214|TR0|Reuters employees. And Reuters 
20110113145121.214|20110113145123.110|TR0|had tried for years to get a 
20110113145123.110|20110113145125.007|TR0|copy of this videotape, which 
20110113145125.007|20110113145126.904|TR0|they knew existed, and they were 
20110113145126.904|20110113145128.800|TR0|not able to. And it was only 
20110113145128.800|20110113145130.697|TR0|through this release that we now 
20110113145130.697|20110113145132.594|TR0|understand what happened. And 
20110113145132.594|20110113145134.490|TR0|then the van came up to help, I 
20110113145134.490|20110113145136.387|TR0|think it was Saeed Chmagh, who 
20110113145136.387|20110113145138.284|TR0|wasn't quite dead yet, though 
20110113145138.284|20110113145140.180|TR0|blown up, and the helicopter 
20110113145140.180|20110113145142.077|TR0|attacked the van. And those are 
20110113145142.077|20110113145143.974|TR0|the two children you're talking 
20110113145143.974|20110113145145.870|TR0|about who were severely injured 
20110113145145.870|20110113145147.767|TR0|inside. Others were killed.
20110113145147.767|20110113145149.664|TR0|
20110113145149.664|20110113145151.560|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: Yeah, 
20110113145151.560|20110113145153.457|TR0|they only survived because, I 
20110113145153.457|20110113145155.354|TR0|think, their father's body 
20110113145155.354|20110113145157.250|TR0|covered them. They killed their 
20110113145157.250|20110113145159.147|TR0|father. His father - the 
20110113145159.147|20110113145201.044|TR0|children's father was driving 
20110113145201.044|20110113145202.940|TR0|them to school, noticed the 
20110113145202.940|20110113145204.837|TR0|wounded man, and tried to help 
20110113145204.837|20110113145206.733|TR0|him. And they were all killed as 
20110113145206.733|20110113145208.630|TR0|a result of that. Except the 
20110113145208.630|20110113145210.527|TR0|children, by some miracle, 
20110113145210.527|20110113145212.423|TR0|survived. And I think it was 
20110113145212.423|20110113145214.320|TR0|actually interesting, there was 
20110113145214.320|20110113145216.217|TR0|an interview with the chief of 
20110113145216.217|20110113145218.113|TR0|Amnesty International in Iceland 
20110113145218.113|20110113145220.010|TR0|just after she had seen the 
20110113145220.010|20110113145221.907|TR0|video, just as it was released, 
20110113145221.907|20110113145223.803|TR0|and she said that by watching 
20110113145223.803|20110113145225.700|TR0|the van being shot up the way it 
20110113145225.700|20110113145227.597|TR0|was shot up, she felt as if it 
20110113145227.597|20110113145229.493|TR0|was witnessing a Red Cross van 
20110113145229.493|20110113145231.390|TR0|being shot up, felt outrageous 
20110113145231.390|20110113145233.287|TR0|to see civilians trying to help 
20110113145233.287|20110113145235.183|TR0|a wounded man being killed like 
20110113145235.183|20110113145237.080|TR0|that.
20110113145237.080|20110113145238.977|TR0|
20110113145238.977|20110113145240.873|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Bradley Manning, 
20110113145240.873|20110113145242.770|TR0|the man who's accused of leaking 
20110113145242.770|20110113145244.667|TR0|these videotapes, who's being 
20110113145244.667|20110113145246.563|TR0|held in solitary confinement - 
20110113145246.563|20110113145248.460|TR0|not convicted, he is pretrial - 
20110113145248.460|20110113145250.357|TR0|has been held in solitary 
20110113145250.357|20110113145252.253|TR0|confinement for many months, 
20110113145252.253|20110113145254.150|TR0|first in Kuwait, then at 
20110113145254.150|20110113145256.047|TR0|Quantico. There's going to be a 
20110113145256.047|20110113145257.943|TR0|protest there at Quantico. Now 
20110113145257.943|20110113145259.840|TR0|in the United States there's 
20110113145259.840|20110113145301.737|TR0|increasing attention on this 
20110113145301.737|20110113145303.633|TR0|isolation. The Los Angeles Times 
20110113145303.633|20110113145305.530|TR0|has a headline, an editorial 
20110113145305.530|20110113145307.427|TR0|headlined "Soldier's Inhumane 
20110113145307.427|20110113145309.323|TR0|Imprisonment." Can you talk 
20110113145309.323|20110113145311.220|TR0|about how he's being dealt with, 
20110113145311.220|20110113145313.117|TR0|Birgitta Jonsdottir?
20110113145313.117|20110113145315.013|TR0|
20110113145315.013|20110113145316.910|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: Yes, and 
20110113145316.910|20110113145318.807|TR0|thank you so much for mentioning 
20110113145318.807|20110113145320.703|TR0|him and for your work in making 
20110113145320.703|20110113145322.600|TR0|people aware of his situation. 
20110113145322.600|20110113145324.497|TR0|Since he is the person that is 
20110113145324.497|20110113145326.393|TR0|in prison because of the video - 
20110113145326.393|20110113145328.290|TR0|we don't know if he is indeed 
20110113145328.290|20110113145330.187|TR0|the person that did it or not; 
20110113145330.187|20110113145332.083|TR0|it doesn't really matter. He is 
20110113145332.083|20110113145333.980|TR0|accused of it. He has been in 
20110113145333.980|20110113145335.877|TR0|prison in solitary confinement 
20110113145335.877|20110113145337.773|TR0|for seven-and-a-half months now. 
20110113145337.773|20110113145339.670|TR0|And there was a very excellent 
20110113145339.670|20110113145341.567|TR0|article by Glenn Greenwald about 
20110113145341.567|20110113145343.463|TR0|his condition that sort of 
20110113145343.463|20110113145345.360|TR0|brought him back on the map. I 
20110113145345.360|20110113145347.257|TR0|really strongly encourage 
20110113145347.257|20110113145349.153|TR0|anybody and in WikiLeaks to make 
20110113145349.153|20110113145351.050|TR0|themselves aware of what is 
20110113145351.050|20110113145352.947|TR0|going on with Bradley Manning. 
20110113145352.947|20110113145354.843|TR0|They can actually hold him 
20110113145354.843|20110113145356.740|TR0|forever without charging him or 
20110113145356.740|20110113145358.637|TR0|putting him on trial, because of 
20110113145358.637|20110113145400.533|TR0|the - it's sort of similar as 
20110113145400.533|20110113145402.430|TR0|the Guantanamo Bay situation, 
20110113145402.430|20110113145404.327|TR0|with him. So, I think it is 
20110113145404.327|20110113145406.223|TR0|really high time for everybody 
20110113145406.223|20110113145408.120|TR0|to put their eyes to Bradley 
20110113145408.120|20110113145410.017|TR0|Manning and support him. Also, I 
20110113145410.017|20110113145411.913|TR0|would very much like for similar 
20110113145411.913|20110113145413.810|TR0|actions for Bradley Manning as 
20110113145413.810|20110113145415.707|TR0|for Julian Assange in London. 
20110113145415.707|20110113145417.603|TR0|And it's been quite shocking 
20110113145417.603|20110113145419.500|TR0|that very many people that know 
20110113145419.500|20110113145421.397|TR0|of WikiLeaks don't know who 
20110113145421.397|20110113145423.293|TR0|Bradley Manning is. So it is 
20110113145423.293|20110113145425.190|TR0|very important that we make 
20110113145425.190|20110113145427.087|TR0|ourselves aware of the situation 
20110113145427.087|20110113145428.983|TR0|he is in. He has just turned 23. 
20110113145428.983|20110113145430.880|TR0|And apparently he is in very 
20110113145430.880|20110113145432.777|TR0|harsh conditions. It is probably 
20110113145432.777|20110113145434.673|TR0|the harshest solitary 
20110113145434.673|20110113145436.570|TR0|confinement you can be in. So, I 
20110113145436.570|20110113145438.467|TR0|just - yeah, I would yet again 
20110113145438.467|20110113145440.363|TR0|like to say that I fully support 
20110113145440.363|20110113145442.260|TR0|Bradley Manning, and I would be 
20110113145442.260|20110113145444.157|TR0|happy to do whatever I need to 
20110113145444.157|20110113145446.053|TR0|do to help him.
20110113145446.053|20110113145447.950|TR0|
20110113145447.950|20110113145449.847|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Birgitta 
20110113145449.847|20110113145451.743|TR0|Jonsdottir, I wanted to ask, as 
20110113145451.743|20110113145453.640|TR0|the most prominent woman 
20110113145453.640|20110113145455.537|TR0|associated with WikiLeaks, about 
20110113145455.537|20110113145457.433|TR0|the - I can't even say 
20110113145457.433|20110113145459.330|TR0|"charges," but the allegations 
20110113145459.330|20110113145501.226|TR0|against Julian Assange around 
20110113145501.226|20110113145503.123|TR0|sexual assault in Sweden. What 
20110113145503.123|20110113145505.020|TR0|are your thoughts on it right 
20110113145505.020|20110113145506.916|TR0|now?
20110113145506.916|20110113145508.813|TR0|
20110113145508.813|20110113145510.710|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: I don't 
20110113145510.710|20110113145512.606|TR0|want to be placed in the role of 
20110113145512.606|20110113145514.503|TR0|the judge in this case, and I 
20110113145514.503|20110113145516.400|TR0|don't think anybody should. None 
20110113145516.400|20110113145518.296|TR0|of us were present in the rooms 
20110113145518.296|20110113145520.193|TR0|where the incidents happened. So 
20110113145520.193|20110113145522.090|TR0|I just find it to be difficult 
20110113145522.090|20110113145523.986|TR0|to say much about it. I just 
20110113145523.986|20110113145525.883|TR0|want it to have its normal sort 
20110113145525.883|20110113145527.780|TR0|of process through the justice 
20110113145527.780|20110113145529.676|TR0|system. If, however, there is 
20110113145529.676|20110113145531.573|TR0|anything that will indicate that 
20110113145531.573|20110113145533.470|TR0|this is because of the work 
20110113145533.470|20110113145535.366|TR0|Julian Assange is doing for 
20110113145535.366|20110113145537.263|TR0|freedom of information, I will 
20110113145537.263|20110113145539.160|TR0|certainly stick my neck out for 
20110113145539.160|20110113145541.056|TR0|him. And I am doing that, and I 
20110113145541.056|20110113145542.953|TR0|have said to his lawyer in the 
20110113145542.953|20110113145544.850|TR0|U.K., if they need any help with 
20110113145544.850|20110113145546.746|TR0|what's going on with the Twitter 
20110113145546.746|20110113145548.643|TR0|subpoena and anything else 
20110113145548.643|20110113145550.540|TR0|related to attempts to have 
20110113145550.540|20110113145552.436|TR0|Julian Assange extradited to the 
20110113145552.436|20110113145554.333|TR0|United States, I will do 
20110113145554.333|20110113145556.230|TR0|whatever I need to and whatever 
20110113145556.230|20110113145558.126|TR0|I can to help stop that, because 
20110113145558.126|20110113145600.023|TR0|I find it to be very important 
20110113145600.023|20110113145601.920|TR0|to separate these two things.
20110113145601.920|20110113145603.816|TR0|
20110113145603.816|20110113145605.713|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20110113145605.713|20110113145607.610|TR0|about how this is being covered 
20110113145607.610|20110113145609.506|TR0|in Iceland? I'm talking about 
20110113145609.506|20110113145611.403|TR0|just how WikiLeaks is being 
20110113145611.403|20110113145613.300|TR0|dealt with. In the United 
20110113145613.300|20110113145615.196|TR0|States, there is hardly a 
20110113145615.196|20110113145617.093|TR0|discussion about the actual 
20110113145617.093|20110113145618.990|TR0|documents that have been 
20110113145618.990|20110113145620.886|TR0|released. When it's discussed, 
20110113145620.886|20110113145622.783|TR0|it's only about what I would 
20110113145622.783|20110113145624.680|TR0|call "Assangination," from 
20110113145624.680|20110113145626.576|TR0|character assassination to 
20110113145626.576|20110113145628.473|TR0|whether Julian Assange should 
20110113145628.473|20110113145630.370|TR0|actually be assassinated. It's 
20110113145630.370|20110113145632.266|TR0|only about the politics of that, 
20110113145632.266|20110113145634.163|TR0|as opposed to the actual 
20110113145634.163|20110113145636.060|TR0|information released in the 
20110113145636.060|20110113145637.956|TR0|cables or the Iraq or 
20110113145637.956|20110113145639.853|TR0|Afghanistan war documents.
20110113145639.853|20110113145641.750|TR0|
20110113145641.750|20110113145643.646|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: Yeah, I 
20110113145643.646|20110113145645.543|TR0|think this is a worldwide 
20110113145645.543|20110113145647.440|TR0|phenomenon. And it actually goes 
20110113145647.440|20110113145649.336|TR0|- ranges from, you know, people 
20110113145649.336|20110113145651.233|TR0|wanting to kill Julian Assange 
20110113145651.233|20110113145653.130|TR0|and the rest of us that have 
20110113145653.130|20110113145655.026|TR0|been affiliated with WikiLeaks, 
20110113145655.026|20110113145656.923|TR0|to incredible hero worship, as 
20110113145656.923|20110113145658.820|TR0|well, which I don't think is 
20110113145658.820|20110113145700.716|TR0|beneficial, either. I think that 
20110113145700.716|20110113145702.613|TR0|we really need to put focus on 
20110113145702.613|20110113145704.510|TR0|the content of the leaks. And 
20110113145704.510|20110113145706.406|TR0|that was the intention of Julian 
20110113145706.406|20110113145708.303|TR0|Assange, to raise awareness 
20110113145708.303|20110113145710.200|TR0|about that. However, it seems to 
20110113145710.200|20110113145712.096|TR0|be a trend with the media to 
20110113145712.096|20110113145713.993|TR0|create heroes, and then it loves 
20110113145713.993|20110113145715.890|TR0|to take down the hero if they 
20110113145715.890|20110113145717.786|TR0|possibly can, because it's a 
20110113145717.786|20110113145719.683|TR0|good headline. So, the media has 
20110113145719.683|20110113145721.580|TR0|some responsibility in how it 
20110113145721.580|20110113145723.476|TR0|has chosen to ignore the 
20110113145723.476|20110113145725.373|TR0|incredible content that has been 
20110113145725.373|20110113145727.270|TR0|revealed on WikiLeaks.

20110113145729.166|20110113145731.063|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: It's 
20110113145731.063|20110113145732.960|TR0|interesting. McClatchy has a 
20110113145732.960|20110113145734.856|TR0|piece out talking about how just 
20110113145734.856|20110113145736.753|TR0|"three years after a major court 
20110113145736.753|20110113145738.650|TR0|confrontation in which many of 
20110113145738.650|20110113145740.546|TR0|America's most important 
20110113145740.546|20110113145742.443|TR0|journalism organizations file

20110113145744.340|20110113145746.236|TR0|much of the U.S. journalistic 
20110113145746.236|20110113145748.133|TR0|community has shunned Assange - 
20110113145748.133|20110113145750.029|TR0|even as reporters write scores 
20110113145750.029|20110113145751.926|TR0|of stories based on WikiLeaks' 
20110113145751.926|20110113145753.823|TR0|trove of leaked State Department 
20110113145753.823|20110113145755.719|TR0|cables."

20110113145757.616|20110113145759.513|TR0|>> BIRGITTA JONSDOTTIR: Yeah, I 
20110113145759.513|20110113145801.409|TR0|find that to be disturbing. I 
20110113145801.409|20110113145803.306|TR0|know that, for example, in 
20110113145803.306|20110113145805.203|TR0|Scandinavia and in Norway, in 
20110113145805.203|20110113145807.099|TR0|particular, they have been using 
20110113145807.099|20110113145808.996|TR0|the content much more than in 
20110113145808.996|20110113145810.893|TR0|the United States. I encourage 
20110113145810.893|20110113145812.789|TR0|people to look at what WikiLeaks 
20110113145812.789|20110113145814.686|TR0|has done for journalism and the 
20110113145814.686|20110113145816.583|TR0|dialogue it has created, also 
20110113145816.583|20110113145818.479|TR0|about the situation of 
20110113145818.479|20110113145820.376|TR0|journalism and how difficult 
20110113145820.376|20110113145822.273|TR0|that it is often for journalists 
20110113145822.273|20110113145824.169|TR0|to publish their stories, and 
20110113145824.169|20110113145826.066|TR0|particularly when it comes to 
20110113145826.066|20110113145827.963|TR0|corruption, be it political 
20110113145827.963|20110113145829.859|TR0|corruption or corruption with
