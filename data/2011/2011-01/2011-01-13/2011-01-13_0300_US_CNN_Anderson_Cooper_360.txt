20110113030007.000|20110113030009.000|TR0|ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  And, if 
20110113030009.000|20110113030011.000|TR0|you're just joining us, welcome to this 
20110113030011.000|20110113030014.000|TR0|special 360 tonight at 10:00.
20110113030014.000|20110113030016.000|TR0|
20110113030016.000|20110113030018.000|TR0|President Obama in Tucson in his role as 
20110113030018.000|20110113030021.000|TR0|healer in chief, speaking at memorial 
20110113030021.000|20110113030023.000|TR0|services for the six killed in Saturday's 
20110113030023.000|20110113030025.000|TR0|massacre, he and Mrs. Obama visiting 
20110113030025.000|20110113030028.000|TR0|families of the fallen and comforting the 
20110113030028.000|20110113030030.000|TR0|wounded, including Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110113030030.000|20110113030033.000|TR0|Giffords.
20110113030033.000|20110113030035.000|TR0|
20110113030035.000|20110113030037.000|TR0|The president tonight delivering some 
20110113030037.000|20110113030040.000|TR0|unexpected news, some unexpectedly good 
20110113030040.000|20110113030042.000|TR0|news about her condition, that her eyes 
20110113030042.000|20110113030044.000|TR0|have opened.
20110113030044.000|20110113030047.000|TR0|
20110113030047.000|20110113030049.000|TR0|Also today, new details were emerging 
20110113030049.000|20110113030051.000|TR0|about the alleged gunman, and earlier 
20110113030051.000|20110113030054.000|TR0|Sarah Palin adding her voice, stirring 
20110113030054.000|20110113030056.000|TR0|controversy by equating criticism of 
20110113030056.000|20110113030059.000|TR0|heated rhetoric surrounding the shooting 
20110113030059.000|20110113030101.000|TR0|with the invocation of collective guilt.  
20110113030101.000|20110113030103.000|TR0|That's the political backdrop.
20110113030103.000|20110113030106.000|TR0|
20110113030106.000|20110113030108.000|TR0|We are going to begin, though, as 
20110113030108.000|20110113030110.000|TR0|apolitically as possible with an 
20110113030110.000|20110113030113.000|TR0|assessment of the president's message 
20110113030113.000|20110113030115.000|TR0|tonight.  We are going to play you an 
20110113030115.000|20110113030117.000|TR0|extended chunk of the president's address, 
20110113030117.000|20110113030120.000|TR0|but I want to go on the telephone.
20110113030120.000|20110113030122.000|TR0|
20110113030122.000|20110113030125.000|TR0|We're joined by New York Senator Kirsten 
20110113030125.000|20110113030127.000|TR0|Gillibrand.
20110113030127.000|20110113030129.000|TR0|
20110113030129.000|20110113030132.000|TR0|Senator, you were actually in the room 
20110113030132.000|20110113030134.000|TR0|when Congresswoman Giffords opened her 
20110113030134.000|20110113030136.000|TR0|eyes; is that correct?
20110113030136.000|20110113030139.000|TR0|
20110113030139.000|20110113030141.000|TR0|SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D), NEW YORK:  I 
20110113030141.000|20110113030143.000|TR0|was.  I was with Congresswoman Debbie 
20110113030143.000|20110113030146.000|TR0|Wasserman Schultz.  I was with Speaker 
20110113030146.000|20110113030148.000|TR0|Pelosi, her parents, her husband, Mark, 
20110113030148.000|20110113030151.000|TR0|and the doctors.
20110113030151.000|20110113030153.000|TR0|
20110113030153.000|20110113030155.000|TR0|COOPER:  What was the moment like?  What 
20110113030155.000|20110113030158.000|TR0|-- what -- tell us about it.
20110113030158.000|20110113030200.000|TR0|
20110113030200.000|20110113030202.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  It was extraordinary.  I 
20110113030202.000|20110113030205.000|TR0|mean, we were -- we were lucky that we 
20110113030205.000|20110113030207.000|TR0|were even getting to visit her.  So, we 
20110113030207.000|20110113030210.000|TR0|felt so blessed that we could even see her.
20110113030210.000|20110113030212.000|TR0|
20110113030212.000|20110113030214.000|TR0|And she was amazing.  She was holding my 
20110113030214.000|20110113030217.000|TR0|hand at the time, and she was squeezing it 
20110113030217.000|20110113030219.000|TR0|and even stroking it.  She was -- 
20110113030219.000|20110113030221.000|TR0|absolutely could hear everything we were 
20110113030221.000|20110113030224.000|TR0|saying.  And Debbie and I were telling her 
20110113030224.000|20110113030226.000|TR0|how much she was inspiring the nation with 
20110113030226.000|20110113030228.000|TR0|her courage, her strength.  And we were 
20110113030228.000|20110113030231.000|TR0|talking about the things we wanted to do 
20110113030231.000|20110113030233.000|TR0|as soon as she was better.
20110113030233.000|20110113030236.000|TR0|
20110113030236.000|20110113030238.000|TR0|And I was saying, we will have another 
20110113030238.000|20110113030240.000|TR0|night out for beer and pizza with your 
20110113030240.000|20110113030243.000|TR0|husband.  And Debbie started talking about 
20110113030243.000|20110113030245.000|TR0|taking her out to their house in New 
20110113030245.000|20110113030247.000|TR0|Hampshire.  And we were just talking about 
20110113030247.000|20110113030250.000|TR0|all the things we wanted to do.     And -- 
20110113030250.000|20110113030252.000|TR0|and, all of a sudden, she started to 
20110113030252.000|20110113030254.000|TR0|struggle to open her eyes.  And -- and so 
20110113030254.000|20110113030257.000|TR0|Mark saw that and said, you know: "Open 
20110113030257.000|20110113030259.000|TR0|your eyes, Gabby.  Open your eyes."
20110113030259.000|20110113030302.000|TR0|
20110113030302.000|20110113030304.000|TR0|And she kept struggling and struggling.  
20110113030304.000|20110113030306.000|TR0|And Mark just kept encouraging her.  And, 
20110113030306.000|20110113030309.000|TR0|within a moment, she literally opened her 
20110113030309.000|20110113030311.000|TR0|eyes. And the doctor was unbelievably 
20110113030311.000|20110113030313.000|TR0|excited, because this was such great 
20110113030313.000|20110113030316.000|TR0|progress.  And -- and so it was something 
20110113030316.000|20110113030318.000|TR0|that we couldn't imagine that -- that we 
20110113030318.000|20110113030320.000|TR0|would have witnessed.
20110113030320.000|20110113030323.000|TR0|
20110113030323.000|20110113030325.000|TR0|But then she -- she took a few moments to 
20110113030325.000|20110113030328.000|TR0|try to focus, and you could see that she 
20110113030328.000|20110113030330.000|TR0|was focusing.  And then Mark said -- he 
20110113030330.000|20110113030332.000|TR0|said: "You know, Gabby, if you can see me, 
20110113030332.000|20110113030335.000|TR0|if you can see me, you know, give us a 
20110113030335.000|20110113030337.000|TR0|thumbs-up, give us a thumbs-up."
20110113030337.000|20110113030339.000|TR0|
20110113030339.000|20110113030342.000|TR0|And she didn't only give the thumbs-up.  
20110113030342.000|20110113030344.000|TR0|She literally raised her entire hand.  And 
20110113030344.000|20110113030347.000|TR0|we were just -- we couldn't stop crying.  
20110113030347.000|20110113030349.000|TR0|We were so excited and so -- just 
20110113030349.000|20110113030351.000|TR0|witnessing something we couldn't imagine 
20110113030351.000|20110113030354.000|TR0|we were in the room for.
20110113030354.000|20110113030356.000|TR0|
20110113030356.000|20110113030358.000|TR0|And it was just one of those moments that 
20110113030358.000|20110113030401.000|TR0|-- that life brings you so rarely.  And 
20110113030401.000|20110113030403.000|TR0|both Debbie and I are just sitting -- 
20110113030403.000|20110113030405.000|TR0|we're sitting there in awe of her, about 
20110113030405.000|20110113030408.000|TR0|her strength and courage and what she was 
20110113030408.000|20110113030410.000|TR0|able to -- to communicate to us.  And it 
20110113030410.000|20110113030413.000|TR0|was an extraordinary moment in both our 
20110113030413.000|20110113030415.000|TR0|lives.
20110113030415.000|20110113030417.000|TR0|
20110113030417.000|20110113030420.000|TR0|COOPER:  And -- and the -- just...
20110113030420.000|20110113030422.000|TR0|
20110113030422.000|20110113030424.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  I mean, Debbie and I were 
20110113030424.000|20110113030427.000|TR0|just talking about it.
20110113030427.000|20110113030429.000|TR0|
20110113030429.000|20110113030431.000|TR0|COOPER:  Just so you know, our viewers, on 
20110113030431.000|20110113030434.000|TR0|the left side of the screen, are watching 
20110113030434.000|20110113030436.000|TR0|the president and Mrs. Obama about to 
20110113030436.000|20110113030439.000|TR0|board Air Force One.
20110113030439.000|20110113030441.000|TR0|
20110113030441.000|20110113030443.000|TR0|Senator, how -- how long did -- I mean, 
20110113030443.000|20110113030446.000|TR0|did she keep her eyes open?  Were her eyes 
20110113030446.000|20110113030448.000|TR0|still open when you left?
20110113030448.000|20110113030450.000|TR0|
20110113030450.000|20110113030453.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  She only kept them open for a 
20110113030453.000|20110113030455.000|TR0|moment, probably about 30 seconds?  How 
20110113030455.000|20110113030457.000|TR0|long?
20110113030457.000|20110113030500.000|TR0|
20110113030500.000|20110113030502.000|TR0|Yes.
20110113030502.000|20110113030505.000|TR0|
20110113030505.000|20110113030507.000|TR0|And how long did she keep them open total? 
20110113030507.000|20110113030509.000|TR0| Maybe 30 -- maybe 30 seconds, maybe 60 
20110113030509.000|20110113030512.000|TR0|seconds, about -- it was just moments, but 
20110113030512.000|20110113030514.000|TR0|it was -- it was open, and then you could 
20110113030514.000|20110113030516.000|TR0|see she was focusing.  And then, when 
20110113030516.000|20110113030519.000|TR0|asked if she could see, she responded 
20110113030519.000|20110113030521.000|TR0|positively.
20110113030521.000|20110113030524.000|TR0|
20110113030524.000|20110113030526.000|TR0|And so it was -- and the doctor said, you 
20110113030526.000|20110113030528.000|TR0|know, after that moment, she's like, she 
20110113030528.000|20110113030531.000|TR0|needs to rest.  And so we said our 
20110113030531.000|20110113030533.000|TR0|good-byes and said we'd be back.  And -- 
20110113030533.000|20110113030535.000|TR0|and, so, it was a moment, but it was a 
20110113030535.000|20110113030538.000|TR0|really important moment for her, and -- 
20110113030538.000|20110113030540.000|TR0|and one that we just feel so blessed to be 
20110113030540.000|20110113030542.000|TR0|a part of.
20110113030542.000|20110113030545.000|TR0|
20110113030545.000|20110113030547.000|TR0|I would like to give the phone to Debbie, 
20110113030547.000|20110113030550.000|TR0|because she'd like to say a few words as 
20110113030550.000|20110113030552.000|TR0|well.
20110113030552.000|20110113030554.000|TR0|
20110113030554.000|20110113030557.000|TR0|COOPER:  Sure.
20110113030557.000|20110113030559.000|TR0|
20110113030559.000|20110113030601.000|TR0|Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz?

20110113030604.000|20110113030606.000|TR0|REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), 
20110113030606.000|20110113030608.000|TR0|FLORIDA:  Hi.  Hi, Anderson. How are you?  
20110113030608.000|20110113030611.000|TR0|It's Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
20110113030611.000|20110113030613.000|TR0|
20110113030613.000|20110113030616.000|TR0|COOPER:  So, explain -- how was it for you 
20110113030616.000|20110113030618.000|TR0|when -- what -- explain what you saw.
20110113030618.000|20110113030620.000|TR0|
20110113030620.000|20110113030623.000|TR0|WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Well, we were -- we 
20110113030623.000|20110113030625.000|TR0|were in the room. Kirsten was holding -- 
20110113030625.000|20110113030627.000|TR0|we were all alternately holding her hand.
20110113030627.000|20110113030630.000|TR0|
20110113030630.000|20110113030632.000|TR0|She -- we were taking turns talking to 
20110113030632.000|20110113030634.000|TR0|her, and, you know, just saying -- you 
20110113030634.000|20110113030637.000|TR0|know, Kirsten talked about, you know, 
20110113030637.000|20110113030639.000|TR0|going out for pizza with -- with their 
20110113030639.000|20110113030642.000|TR0|husbands.  And then I said, because we 
20110113030642.000|20110113030644.000|TR0|have vacationed with Mark and Gabby for 
20110113030644.000|20110113030646.000|TR0|the last couple of summers.  They have 
20110113030646.000|20110113030649.000|TR0|come up to our house in New Hampshire.
20110113030649.000|20110113030651.000|TR0|
20110113030651.000|20110113030653.000|TR0|So, I told her -- I said, come on, you 
20110113030653.000|20110113030656.000|TR0|have got to get better as quick as 
20110113030656.000|20110113030658.000|TR0|possible, because we expect you up in New 
20110113030658.000|20110113030701.000|TR0|Hampshire this summer.  And, just as I 
20110113030701.000|20110113030703.000|TR0|said that, that's when she suddenly (AUDIO 
20110113030703.000|20110113030705.000|TR0|GAP) struggling to open her -- struggling 
20110113030705.000|20110113030708.000|TR0|to open her eyes.
20110113030708.000|20110113030710.000|TR0|
20110113030710.000|20110113030712.000|TR0|And, you know, at first -- at first, it 
20110113030712.000|20110113030715.000|TR0|was just a little bit. The doctors 
20110113030715.000|20110113030717.000|TR0|couldn't believe it.  They -- they said, 
20110113030717.000|20110113030719.000|TR0|this is -- you know, this is such a good 
20110113030719.000|20110113030722.000|TR0|sign -- and then they -- sorry, we're just 
20110113030722.000|20110113030724.000|TR0|coming up to the plane -- this is such a 
20110113030724.000|20110113030727.000|TR0|good sign.
20110113030727.000|20110113030729.000|TR0|
20110113030729.000|20110113030731.000|TR0|Then Mark started encouraging her.  "You 
20110113030731.000|20110113030734.000|TR0|know, Gabby, you know, give me a thumbs-up 
20110113030734.000|20110113030736.000|TR0|if you can see.  If can you see me, touch 
20110113030736.000|20110113030738.000|TR0|my ring. You know, touch my wedding ring."
20110113030738.000|20110113030741.000|TR0|
20110113030741.000|20110113030743.000|TR0|So, she started doing that.  She started 
20110113030743.000|20110113030745.000|TR0|rubbing his arm.  Then her arm -- when he 
20110113030745.000|20110113030748.000|TR0|asked her again to -- to give him the 
20110113030748.000|20110113030750.000|TR0|thumbs-up if she -- we just kept talking 
20110113030750.000|20110113030753.000|TR0|to her and talking to her about the fun 
20110113030753.000|20110113030755.000|TR0|that we have had with her.
20110113030755.000|20110113030757.000|TR0|
20110113030757.000|20110113030800.000|TR0|And so then she opened her eyes more.  I 
20110113030800.000|20110113030802.000|TR0|mean, she went from opening her eyes 
20110113030802.000|20110113030804.000|TR0|really just in slits to opening them 
20110113030804.000|20110113030807.000|TR0|almost fully.  I mean, it wasn't for very 
20110113030807.000|20110113030809.000|TR0|long, and then they would close again.
20110113030809.000|20110113030811.000|TR0|
20110113030811.000|20110113030814.000|TR0|But it was just absolutely -- Anderson, it 
20110113030814.000|20110113030816.000|TR0|was the most incredible -- other than the 
20110113030816.000|20110113030819.000|TR0|birth of my kids, it was the most 
20110113030819.000|20110113030821.000|TR0|incredible experience that I have ever -- 
20110113030821.000|20110113030823.000|TR0|I have ever had.
20110113030823.000|20110113030826.000|TR0|
20110113030826.000|20110113030828.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110113030828.000|20110113030830.000|TR0|
20110113030830.000|20110113030833.000|TR0|COOPER:  Congresswoman -- Congresswoman 
20110113030833.000|20110113030835.000|TR0|Debbie Wasserman Schultz, you're breaking

20110113030840.000|20110113030842.000|TR0|
20110113030842.000|20110113030845.000|TR0|Joining us now is Congresswoman Giffords' 
20110113030845.000|20110113030847.000|TR0|communications director, C.J. Karamargin.
20110113030847.000|20110113030849.000|TR0|
20110113030849.000|20110113030852.000|TR0|C.J., I appreciate you being with us.

20110113030859.000|20110113030901.000|TR0|Sure.
20110113030901.000|20110113030904.000|TR0|
20110113030904.000|20110113030906.000|TR0|COOPER:  You know, we have just been 
20110113030906.000|20110113030908.000|TR0|talking to Senator Gillibrand and 
20110113030908.000|20110113030911.000|TR0|Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, 
20110113030911.000|20110113030913.000|TR0|who say they were in the room when 
20110113030913.000|20110113030915.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords actually opened her 
20110113030915.000|20110113030918.000|TR0|eyes.
20110113030918.000|20110113030920.000|TR0|
20110113030920.000|20110113030922.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Yes.
20110113030922.000|20110113030925.000|TR0|
20110113030925.000|20110113030927.000|TR0|COOPER:  You've been in that hospital.  
20110113030927.000|20110113030930.000|TR0|Explain, what is the scene like there?
20110113030930.000|20110113030932.000|TR0|
20110113030932.000|20110113030934.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Well, the scene is an 
20110113030934.000|20110113030937.000|TR0|intensive care unit.  There are doctors 
20110113030937.000|20110113030939.000|TR0|and monitors and tubes.  And it's a -- 
20110113030939.000|20110113030941.000|TR0|it's a hospital with a patient in critical 
20110113030941.000|20110113030944.000|TR0|condition.
20110113030944.000|20110113030946.000|TR0|
20110113030946.000|20110113030948.000|TR0|But I was speaking with Senator Gillibrand 
20110113030948.000|20110113030951.000|TR0|and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz 
20110113030951.000|20110113030953.000|TR0|right before the president spoke, when the 
20110113030953.000|20110113030956.000|TR0|congresswoman's staff met with the 
20110113030956.000|20110113030958.000|TR0|congresswoman -- when the president met 
20110113030958.000|20110113031000.000|TR0|with the congresswoman's staff -- excuse 
20110113031000.000|20110113031003.000|TR0|me.
20110113031003.000|20110113031005.000|TR0|
20110113031005.000|20110113031007.000|TR0|And we heard that same story.  And it is 
20110113031007.000|20110113031010.000|TR0|just so heartening, Anderson.  Mark Kelly, 
20110113031010.000|20110113031012.000|TR0|the congresswoman's husband, told us that 
20110113031012.000|20110113031014.000|TR0|the congresswoman reached out toward his 
20110113031014.000|20110113031017.000|TR0|face, touched his wedding ring.
20110113031017.000|20110113031019.000|TR0|
20110113031019.000|20110113031022.000|TR0|And, you know, our boss is a fighter, and 
20110113031022.000|20110113031024.000|TR0|she's fighting.  And we saw that today.
20110113031024.000|20110113031026.000|TR0|
20110113031026.000|20110113031029.000|TR0|COOPER:  We're looking at pictures, live 
20110113031029.000|20110113031031.000|TR0|pictures of the -- the memorial, the 
20110113031031.000|20110113031033.000|TR0|makeshift memorial that has sprung up 
20110113031033.000|20110113031036.000|TR0|outside the hospital where the 
20110113031036.000|20110113031038.000|TR0|congresswoman is.
20110113031038.000|20110113031041.000|TR0|
20110113031041.000|20110113031043.000|TR0|And it's just -- it's been growing every 
20110113031043.000|20110113031045.000|TR0|day.  And it's just this extraordinary 
20110113031045.000|20110113031048.000|TR0|outpouring from people, probably from all 
20110113031048.000|20110113031050.000|TR0|over the country...
20110113031050.000|20110113031052.000|TR0|
20110113031052.000|20110113031055.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Right.
20110113031055.000|20110113031057.000|TR0|
20110113031057.000|20110113031059.000|TR0|COOPER:  ... who have sent things, people 
20110113031059.000|20110113031102.000|TR0|from the state, who just want to do 
20110113031102.000|20110113031104.000|TR0|something.
20110113031104.000|20110113031107.000|TR0|
20110113031107.000|20110113031109.000|TR0|What -- do you think -- I mean...
20110113031109.000|20110113031111.000|TR0|
20110113031111.000|20110113031114.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Well, Anderson, you saw...
20110113031114.000|20110113031116.000|TR0|
20110113031116.000|20110113031118.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes.
20110113031118.000|20110113031121.000|TR0|
20110113031121.000|20110113031123.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  You saw the human version of 
20110113031123.000|20110113031125.000|TR0|that in this auditorium tonight, that -- 
20110113031125.000|20110113031128.000|TR0|that outpouring, that expression of love 
20110113031128.000|20110113031130.000|TR0|and support.
20110113031130.000|20110113031133.000|TR0|
20110113031133.000|20110113031135.000|TR0|You know, I don't know what the political 
20110113031135.000|20110113031137.000|TR0|analysis is going -- political analysis is 
20110113031137.000|20110113031140.000|TR0|going to be of what the president's 
20110113031140.000|20110113031142.000|TR0|remarks were.  But, in the -- in McKale 
20110113031142.000|20110113031144.000|TR0|Center, we had about 13,000 people 
20110113031144.000|20110113031147.000|TR0|outside, another 13,000 people -- 26,000 
20110113031147.000|20110113031149.000|TR0|people coming to express their support and 
20110113031149.000|20110113031151.000|TR0|love for the victims of this tragedy.
20110113031151.000|20110113031154.000|TR0|
20110113031154.000|20110113031156.000|TR0|As I was leaving, a woman called me over 
20110113031156.000|20110113031159.000|TR0|and gave me this rosary and asked me to 
20110113031159.000|20110113031201.000|TR0|give it to the congresswoman.  I mean, 
20110113031201.000|20110113031203.000|TR0|this is the atmosphere we have here.  It 
20110113031203.000|20110113031206.000|TR0|is a great tableau.
20110113031206.000|20110113031208.000|TR0|
20110113031208.000|20110113031210.000|TR0|From my seat, I could look down and I 
20110113031210.000|20110113031213.000|TR0|could see the first lady, Barack Obama.  
20110113031213.000|20110113031215.000|TR0|And next to him was the hero, Daniel 
20110113031215.000|20110113031218.000|TR0|Hernandez, right next to Daniel Hernandez, 
20110113031218.000|20110113031220.000|TR0|a famous daughter of Arizona, Sandra Day 
20110113031220.000|20110113031222.000|TR0|O'Connor.  I mean, it was just -- the 
20110113031222.000|20110113031225.000|TR0|tableau of America that we saw tonight was 
20110113031225.000|20110113031227.000|TR0|truly inspirational.
20110113031227.000|20110113031229.000|TR0|
20110113031229.000|20110113031232.000|TR0|COOPER:  I think a lot of viewers were 
20110113031232.000|20110113031234.000|TR0|surprised -- I know I was surprised -- by 
20110113031234.000|20110113031236.000|TR0|the applause and the cheering early on.
20110113031236.000|20110113031239.000|TR0|
20110113031239.000|20110113031241.000|TR0|Explain that for those who aren't there.  
20110113031241.000|20110113031244.000|TR0|John King was saying, if you spent time 
20110113031244.000|20110113031246.000|TR0|there, if you have been there for the last 
20110113031246.000|20110113031248.000|TR0|couple days, people need to cheer.
20110113031248.000|20110113031251.000|TR0|
20110113031251.000|20110113031253.000|TR0|Did -- did you feel that?
20110113031253.000|20110113031255.000|TR0|
20110113031255.000|20110113031258.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Yes.  People need to cheer.  
20110113031258.000|20110113031300.000|TR0|People need to cry.
20110113031300.000|20110113031302.000|TR0|
20110113031302.000|20110113031305.000|TR0|There's a catharsis that's necessary when 
20110113031305.000|20110113031307.000|TR0|we -- when our community goes through a 
20110113031307.000|20110113031310.000|TR0|tragedy like this.  And that was the -- I 
20110113031310.000|20110113031312.000|TR0|think, the great thing about the remarks 
20110113031312.000|20110113031314.000|TR0|that we heard tonight.  It was an 
20110113031314.000|20110113031317.000|TR0|acknowledgment by the president of a 
20110113031317.000|20110113031319.000|TR0|community that's trying to come to terms 
20110113031319.000|20110113031321.000|TR0|with unbearable grief.
20110113031321.000|20110113031324.000|TR0|
20110113031324.000|20110113031326.000|TR0|And he did, I think, an admirable, 
20110113031326.000|20110113031328.000|TR0|memorable job.  In that arena, it was 
20110113031328.000|20110113031331.000|TR0|impossible not to be touched by the 
20110113031331.000|20110113031333.000|TR0|president's words.
20110113031333.000|20110113031336.000|TR0|
20110113031336.000|20110113031338.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, I know, I mean, everybody's 
20110113031338.000|20110113031340.000|TR0|thoughts and our prayers are with the 
20110113031340.000|20110113031343.000|TR0|congresswoman and -- and all the members 
20110113031343.000|20110113031345.000|TR0|of your staff and all the folks down there 
20110113031345.000|20110113031347.000|TR0|who are still wounded, still trying to 
20110113031347.000|20110113031350.000|TR0|come to terms with what we have been 
20110113031350.000|20110113031352.000|TR0|witnessing and what happened to them.
20110113031352.000|20110113031355.000|TR0|
20110113031355.000|20110113031357.000|TR0|We're going to talk to Sanjay Gupta in 
20110113031357.000|20110113031359.000|TR0|just a moment.
20110113031359.000|20110113031402.000|TR0|
20110113031402.000|20110113031404.000|TR0|C.J., I appreciate you being with us.
20110113031404.000|20110113031406.000|TR0|
20110113031406.000|20110113031409.000|TR0|Sanjay, obviously, this is amazing news 
20110113031409.000|20110113031411.000|TR0|that the congresswoman's eyes have opened. 
20110113031411.000|20110113031413.000|TR0| The importance of it medically for you?
20110113031413.000|20110113031416.000|TR0|
20110113031416.000|20110113031418.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL 
20110113031418.000|20110113031421.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, now they 
20110113031421.000|20110113031423.000|TR0|have given us some more information here, 
20110113031423.000|20110113031425.000|TR0|Anderson, specifically that she sounds 
20110113031425.000|20110113031428.000|TR0|like she was really doing it because she 
20110113031428.000|20110113031430.000|TR0|was being asked to do it.
20110113031430.000|20110113031432.000|TR0|
20110113031432.000|20110113031435.000|TR0|You know, she -- she was being -- they -- 
20110113031435.000|20110113031437.000|TR0|they were talking to her, relaying 
20110113031437.000|20110113031439.000|TR0|stories, and then asking her to open her 
20110113031439.000|20110113031442.000|TR0|eyes, which she did.  And that takes it to 
20110113031442.000|20110113031444.000|TR0|a whole different level, as opposed to 
20110113031444.000|20110113031447.000|TR0|just spontaneous eye-opening, which is 
20110113031447.000|20110113031449.000|TR0|significant.  But doing it to a command, 
20110113031449.000|20110113031451.000|TR0|doing -- you know, and then reaching out 
20110113031451.000|20110113031454.000|TR0|with her hand and touching specific 
20110113031454.000|20110113031456.000|TR0|things, the wedding ring, for example -- I 
20110113031456.000|20110113031458.000|TR0|heard the story -- those -- those are all 
20110113031458.000|20110113031501.000|TR0|very significant.
20110113031501.000|20110113031503.000|TR0|
20110113031503.000|20110113031505.000|TR0|It sounds like she is really hearing, 
20110113031505.000|20110113031508.000|TR0|processing everything, and being able to 
20110113031508.000|20110113031510.000|TR0|execute these commands in a way that's 
20110113031510.000|20110113031513.000|TR0|improving day by day.  Eye-opening, again, 
20110113031513.000|20110113031515.000|TR0|as I mentioned earlier, you really -- you 
20110113031515.000|20110113031517.000|TR0|-- you look at people's motor skills, 
20110113031517.000|20110113031520.000|TR0|which she is showing, their eye- opening, 
20110113031520.000|20110113031522.000|TR0|which she's now showing.  Verbal skills 
20110113031522.000|20110113031524.000|TR0|would be sort of a third category.
20110113031524.000|20110113031527.000|TR0|
20110113031527.000|20110113031529.000|TR0|She can't do that right now because of the 
20110113031529.000|20110113031532.000|TR0|breathing tube that she still has in, but, 
20110113031532.000|20110113031534.000|TR0|you know, forward movement, Anderson,

20110113031827.000|20110113031829.000|TR0|gathered outside a supermarket to exercise 
20110113031829.000|20110113031831.000|TR0|their right to peaceful assembly and free 
20110113031831.000|20110113031834.000|TR0|speech.

20110113031841.000|20110113031843.000|TR0|OBAMA:  They were fulfilling a central 
20110113031843.000|20110113031845.000|TR0|tenet of the democracy envisioned by our 
20110113031845.000|20110113031848.000|TR0|founders: representatives of the people 
20110113031848.000|20110113031850.000|TR0|answering questions to their constituents, 
20110113031850.000|20110113031853.000|TR0|so as to carry their concerns back to our 
20110113031853.000|20110113031855.000|TR0|nation's capital.  Gabby called it 
20110113031855.000|20110113031857.000|TR0|"Congress on Your Corner," just an updated 
20110113031857.000|20110113031900.000|TR0|version of government of and by and for

20110113031912.000|20110113031914.000|TR0|scene, that was the scene that was 
20110113031914.000|20110113031916.000|TR0|shattered by a gunman's bullets.  And the 
20110113031916.000|20110113031919.000|TR0|six people who lost their lives on 
20110113031919.000|20110113031921.000|TR0|Saturday, they, too, represented what is 
20110113031921.000|20110113031923.000|TR0|best in us, what is best in America.

20110113031930.000|20110113031933.000|TR0|our hearts also have reason for fullness.

20110113031938.000|20110113031940.000|TR0|the 13 Americans who survived the 
20110113031940.000|20110113031942.000|TR0|shooting, including the congresswoman many 
20110113031942.000|20110113031945.000|TR0|of them went to see on Saturday.  I have 
20110113031945.000|20110113031947.000|TR0|just come from the University Medical 
20110113031947.000|20110113031949.000|TR0|Center, just a mile from here, where our 
20110113031949.000|20110113031952.000|TR0|friend Gabby courageously fights to 
20110113031952.000|20110113031954.000|TR0|recover even as we speak.

20110113031956.000|20110113031959.000|TR0|And I want to tell you -- her husband, 
20110113031959.000|20110113032001.000|TR0|Mark, is here, and he allows me to share 
20110113032001.000|20110113032004.000|TR0|this with you.  Right after we went to 
20110113032004.000|20110113032006.000|TR0|visit, a few minutes after we left her 
20110113032006.000|20110113032008.000|TR0|room and some of her colleagues from 
20110113032008.000|20110113032011.000|TR0|Congress were in the room, Gabby opened

20110113032105.000|20110113032107.000|TR0|that good news, and our hearts are full of

20110113032110.000|20110113032112.000|TR0| Their actions, their selflessness poses a 
20110113032112.000|20110113032115.000|TR0|challenge to each of us.  It raises the 
20110113032115.000|20110113032117.000|TR0|question of what, beyond prayers and 
20110113032117.000|20110113032119.000|TR0|expressions of concern, is required of us 
20110113032119.000|20110113032122.000|TR0|going forward.  How can we honor the 
20110113032122.000|20110113032124.000|TR0|fallen?  How can we be true to their 
20110113032124.000|20110113032126.000|TR0|memory?

20110113032129.000|20110113032131.000|TR0|You see, when a tragedy like this strikes, 
20110113032131.000|20110113032133.000|TR0|it is part of our nature to demand 
20110113032133.000|20110113032136.000|TR0|explanations, to try to impose some order 
20110113032136.000|20110113032138.000|TR0|on the chaos and make sense out of that 
20110113032138.000|20110113032141.000|TR0|which seems senseless.

20110113032150.000|20110113032152.000|TR0|about everything from the merits of gun 
20110113032152.000|20110113032155.000|TR0|safety laws to the adequacy of our mental

20110113032207.000|20110113032209.000|TR0|OBAMA:  ... of debating what might be done 
20110113032209.000|20110113032211.000|TR0|to prevent such tragedies in the future is 
20110113032211.000|20110113032214.000|TR0|an essential ingredient in our exercise of 
20110113032214.000|20110113032216.000|TR0|self- government.

20110113032223.000|20110113032226.000|TR0|when we are far too eager to lay the blame 
20110113032226.000|20110113032228.000|TR0|for all that ails the world at the feet of 
20110113032228.000|20110113032230.000|TR0|those who happen to think differently than 
20110113032230.000|20110113032233.000|TR0|we do, it's important for us to pause for 
20110113032233.000|20110113032235.000|TR0|a moment and make sure that we're talking 
20110113032235.000|20110113032237.000|TR0|with each other in a way that -- that 
20110113032237.000|20110113032240.000|TR0|heals, not in a way that wounds.

20110113032242.000|20110113032244.000|TR0|For the truth is, none of us can know

20110113032247.000|20110113032249.000|TR0|attack.  None of us can know with any 
20110113032249.000|20110113032252.000|TR0|certainty what might have stopped these 
20110113032252.000|20110113032254.000|TR0|shots from being fired or what thoughts 
20110113032254.000|20110113032256.000|TR0|lurked in the inner recesses of a violent

20110113032450.000|20110113032452.000|TR0|them.  In George and Dot, in Dorwan and

20110113032702.000|20110113032705.000|TR0|goodness and that the forces that divide

20110113032743.000|20110113032745.000|TR0|COOPER:  President Obama, a rousing speech 
20110113032745.000|20110113032747.000|TR0|in front of a capacity crowd at the 
20110113032747.000|20110113032750.000|TR0|University of Arizona, everyone -- telling 
20110113032750.000|20110113032752.000|TR0|everyone to live up to the best in the 
20110113032752.000|20110113032754.000|TR0|fallen, the heroes, and ourselves.

20110113032757.000|20110113032759.000|TR0|Joining us now, senior political analyst 
20110113032759.000|20110113032801.000|TR0|David Gergen, presidential historian 
20110113032801.000|20110113032804.000|TR0|Douglas Brinkley, and former Bush 
20110113032804.000|20110113032806.000|TR0|speechwriter Michael Gerson.

20110113032809.000|20110113032811.000|TR0|Doug Brinkley, what did you make of this?  
20110113032811.000|20110113032813.000|TR0|The first we're hearing from you.
20110113032813.000|20110113032816.000|TR0|
20110113032816.000|20110113032818.000|TR0|DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  
20110113032818.000|20110113032820.000|TR0|Well, I thought President Obama did a 
20110113032820.000|20110113032823.000|TR0|wonderful job this evening.  I thought 
20110113032823.000|20110113032825.000|TR0|that he really brought people together.
20110113032825.000|20110113032827.000|TR0|
20110113032827.000|20110113032830.000|TR0|I mean, when he, in the middle of the 
20110113032830.000|20110113032832.000|TR0|speech, said, "Gabby opened her eyes, 
20110113032832.000|20110113032835.000|TR0|Gabby opened her eyes," and you could 
20110113032835.000|20110113032837.000|TR0|almost hear a Martin Luther King-like 
20110113032837.000|20110113032839.000|TR0|inflection -- and he carried that 
20110113032839.000|20110113032842.000|TR0|throughout a lot of the speech.
20110113032842.000|20110113032844.000|TR0|
20110113032844.000|20110113032846.000|TR0|I was, like David Gergen earlier, a little 
20110113032846.000|20110113032849.000|TR0|put off by the atmospherics, 14,000 
20110113032849.000|20110113032851.000|TR0|cheering people.  But the president, I 
20110113032851.000|20110113032853.000|TR0|think, worked his way into that 
20110113032853.000|20110113032856.000|TR0|atmosphere.  So, by the end of it, you 
20110113032856.000|20110113032858.000|TR0|could almost feel people hugging in the 
20110113032858.000|20110113032901.000|TR0|excitement, in the warmth and the love in 
20110113032901.000|20110113032903.000|TR0|the arena.
20110113032903.000|20110113032905.000|TR0|
20110113032905.000|20110113032908.000|TR0|So, I think, Tucson, it really was a 
20110113032908.000|20110113032910.000|TR0|speech for the people there. And it's the 
20110113032910.000|20110113032912.000|TR0|city that's been hurting so much.  Some 
20110113032912.000|20110113032915.000|TR0|day, there will be a plaque out in front 
20110113032915.000|20110113032917.000|TR0|of that auditorium that Barack Obama gave 
20110113032917.000|20110113032920.000|TR0|this very significant speech there.
20110113032920.000|20110113032922.000|TR0|
20110113032922.000|20110113032924.000|TR0|And the president, I think, struck a tone 
20110113032924.000|20110113032927.000|TR0|of civility.  I think he's been on a bit 
20110113032927.000|20110113032929.000|TR0|of a political role lately.  And he's only 
20110113032929.000|20110113032931.000|TR0|enhanced by, I think, giving a performance 
20110113032931.000|20110113032934.000|TR0|like this, because it seemed heartfelt.  
20110113032934.000|20110113032936.000|TR0|And he -- he conjured up, I think, some 
20110113032936.000|20110113032938.000|TR0|powerful images and made sure that he -- 
20110113032938.000|20110113032941.000|TR0|he commented on all the people he needed 
20110113032941.000|20110113032943.000|TR0|to, as any good memorial speech needs to 
20110113032943.000|20110113032946.000|TR0|do.
20110113032946.000|20110113032948.000|TR0|
20110113032948.000|20110113032950.000|TR0|COOPER:  David, I mean, I do get the 
20110113032950.000|20110113032953.000|TR0|sense, in watching this, that, unless 
20110113032953.000|20110113032955.000|TR0|you're there, unless you're -- you know, 
20110113032955.000|20110113032957.000|TR0|live in -- in -- in Tucson, live in 
20110113032957.000|20110113033000.000|TR0|Arizona, and are living through this on 
20110113033000.000|20110113033002.000|TR0|the ground in a very visceral way -- I 
20110113033002.000|20110113033004.000|TR0|mean, we're all feeling it, we're all 
20110113033004.000|20110113033007.000|TR0|thinking about it constantly, but unless 
20110113033007.000|20110113033009.000|TR0|you're actually part of that community, 
20110113033009.000|20110113033012.000|TR0|you kind of don't get the -- the reason 
20110113033012.000|20110113033014.000|TR0|for cheering.  You don't have that same 
20110113033014.000|20110113033016.000|TR0|sense of -- you know, wanting a release 
20110113033016.000|20110113033019.000|TR0|and wanting to have this shared common 
20110113033019.000|20110113033021.000|TR0|experience.
20110113033021.000|20110113033023.000|TR0|
20110113033023.000|20110113033026.000|TR0|GERGEN:  That's a very perceptive comment, 
20110113033026.000|20110113033028.000|TR0|Anderson.  I did feel that the whole 
20110113033028.000|20110113033030.000|TR0|country must have been heartened by -- by 
20110113033030.000|20110113033033.000|TR0|the story of her opening her eyes.  And 
20110113033033.000|20110113033035.000|TR0|your conversation with the senator, and 
20110113033035.000|20110113033038.000|TR0|the congresswoman, that was to me, I think 
20110113033038.000|20110113033040.000|TR0|all of us were just enormously encouraged 
20110113033040.000|20110113033042.000|TR0|and that to me was the high point of the 
20110113033042.000|20110113033045.000|TR0|evening.
20110113033045.000|20110113033047.000|TR0|
20110113033047.000|20110113033049.000|TR0|And I do think in the replaying, the 
20110113033049.000|20110113033052.000|TR0|president's call to civility and decency 
20110113033052.000|20110113033054.000|TR0|in the way we treat each other is very 
20110113033054.000|20110113033057.000|TR0|important.  But do I agree with you that, 
20110113033057.000|20110113033059.000|TR0|unless you're in Tucson, I think it's 
20110113033059.000|20110113033101.000|TR0|really sort of hard to relate to the 
20110113033101.000|20110113033104.000|TR0|cheering at a time when, you know, there's 
20110113033104.000|20110113033106.000|TR0|a sense of grieving and a sense of 
20110113033106.000|20110113033108.000|TR0|wonderment in the country about this 
20110113033108.000|20110113033111.000|TR0|continuing violence.
20110113033111.000|20110113033113.000|TR0|
20110113033113.000|20110113033115.000|TR0|I also felt that the president calling for 
20110113033115.000|20110113033118.000|TR0|decency was absolutely right.  I was 
20110113033118.000|20110113033120.000|TR0|delighted he did that.  But as he said, as 
20110113033120.000|20110113033123.000|TR0|we debate going forward, it's not clear to 
20110113033123.000|20110113033125.000|TR0|me what he want to debate.  About what led 
20110113033125.000|20110113033127.000|TR0|to the killing and leads to this kind of 
20110113033127.000|20110113033130.000|TR0|violence.  And I think it's not clear 
20110113033130.000|20110113033132.000|TR0|where this goes from here.
20110113033132.000|20110113033134.000|TR0|
20110113033134.000|20110113033137.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, I think, Michael, clearly, 
20110113033137.000|20110113033139.000|TR0|the president was not focusing on what 
20110113033139.000|20110113033141.000|TR0|happened before, but was focusing on the 
20110113033141.000|20110113033144.000|TR0|debate that's sprung up and the tone of 
20110113033144.000|20110113033146.000|TR0|the debate that's sprung up since the 
20110113033146.000|20110113033149.000|TR0|shooting.
20110113033149.000|20110113033151.000|TR0|
20110113033151.000|20110113033153.000|TR0|GERSON:  I agree with that.  And in that 
20110113033153.000|20110113033156.000|TR0|context he called on people to avoid the 
20110113033156.000|20110113033158.000|TR0|blame game.  That's been one of the most 
20110113033158.000|20110113033200.000|TR0|disturbing aspects of what's happened, is 
20110113033200.000|20110113033203.000|TR0|that people have been taking the idea of 
20110113033203.000|20110113033205.000|TR0|civility, the idea of tolerance, and using 
20110113033205.000|20110113033207.000|TR0|it as a weapon in their ideological 
20110113033207.000|20110113033210.000|TR0|battles.  And, you know, that -- that is 
20110113033210.000|20110113033212.000|TR0|both ironic and disturbing.  And the 
20110113033212.000|20110113033215.000|TR0|president criticized that in this speech.  
20110113033215.000|20110113033217.000|TR0|I think he deserves credit for that.
20110113033217.000|20110113033219.000|TR0|
20110113033219.000|20110113033222.000|TR0|So, you know, I'm just not sure that, in a 
20110113033222.000|20110113033224.000|TR0|memorial service like this, addressing the 
20110113033224.000|20110113033226.000|TR0|news cycle, addressing the issue of the 
20110113033226.000|20110113033229.000|TR0|day, which this is definitely the issue of 
20110113033229.000|20110113033231.000|TR0|the day, was the right approach. I think 
20110113033231.000|20110113033234.000|TR0|there might have been other settings to do 
20110113033234.000|20110113033236.000|TR0|that.  But what he said, I think, was 
20110113033236.000|20110113033238.000|TR0|constructive.
20110113033238.000|20110113033241.000|TR0|
20110113033241.000|20110113033243.000|TR0|COOPER:  Doug Brinkley, do you think that 
20110113033243.000|20110113033245.000|TR0|this was kind of the Obama of old during 
20110113033245.000|20110113033248.000|TR0|the campaign, sort of some of the tenor, 
20110113033248.000|20110113033250.000|TR0|some of the -- the cadences that he used?
20110113033250.000|20110113033252.000|TR0|
20110113033252.000|20110113033255.000|TR0|BRINKLEY:  Part of it.  Some of it seemed 
20110113033255.000|20110113033257.000|TR0|like a little bit of a teleprompter 
20110113033257.000|20110113033300.000|TR0|speech, where he was making sure he had 
20110113033300.000|20110113033302.000|TR0|all the people's names right and said 
20110113033302.000|20110113033304.000|TR0|things exactly right, and another part of 
20110113033304.000|20110113033307.000|TR0|the speech seemed quite moving and 
20110113033307.000|20110113033309.000|TR0|passionate.
20110113033309.000|20110113033311.000|TR0|
20110113033311.000|20110113033314.000|TR0|But as he's leaving Tucson tonight with 
20110113033314.000|20110113033316.000|TR0|his wife, they must have had a very moving 
20110113033316.000|20110113033318.000|TR0|day...
20110113033318.000|20110113033321.000|TR0|
20110113033321.000|20110113033323.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes.
20110113033323.000|20110113033326.000|TR0|
20110113033326.000|20110113033328.000|TR0|BRINKLEY:  ... being in the hospital and 
20110113033328.000|20110113033330.000|TR0|seeing Gabby and all of this.  So I think 
20110113033330.000|20110113033333.000|TR0|the president was a winner for coming to 
20110113033333.000|20110113033335.000|TR0|Tucson.  I think most Americans will think 
20110113033335.000|20110113033337.000|TR0|he did a good job.
20110113033337.000|20110113033340.000|TR0|
20110113033340.000|20110113033342.000|TR0|COOPER:  In a moment you're actually going 
20110113033342.000|20110113033344.000|TR0|to hear from some of the folks who met the 
20110113033344.000|20110113033347.000|TR0|president today.  I'm going to talk to 
20110113033347.000|20110113033349.000|TR0|Christina's parents, to John and Roxanna 
20110113033349.000|20110113033352.000|TR0|Green about what they talked to President 
20110113033352.000|20110113033354.000|TR0|Obama about.
20110113033354.000|20110113033356.000|TR0|
20110113033356.000|20110113033359.000|TR0|We'll also talk to some of the survivors 
20110113033359.000|20110113033401.000|TR0|from the shooting, the McMahon family, the 
20110113033401.000|20110113033403.000|TR0|mom.  You see her right there, second from 
20110113033403.000|20110113033406.000|TR0|the right.  She was hit by gunfire three 
20110113033406.000|20110113033408.000|TR0|times.  Saved her daughter's life, she 
20110113033408.000|20110113033410.000|TR0|did.  We'll talk to them ahead and we'll 
20110113033410.000|20110113033413.000|TR0|have Christina's story, Christina Green, 
20110113033413.000|20110113033415.000|TR0|just 9 years old.  The president spoke 
20110113033415.000|20110113033418.000|TR0|about her a lot tonight.  We'll talk to 
20110113033418.000|20110113033420.000|TR0|them all ahead.
20110113033420.000|20110113033422.000|TR0|

20110113033427.000|20110113033429.000|TR0|COOPER:  Even as preparations were 
20110113033429.000|20110113033432.000|TR0|underway for tonight's event in Tucson, 
20110113033432.000|20110113033434.000|TR0|new details were emerging about the 
20110113033434.000|20110113033437.000|TR0|suspect, Jared Loughner.
20110113033437.000|20110113033439.000|TR0|
20110113033439.000|20110113033441.000|TR0|Randi Kaye has been following that angle.  
20110113033441.000|20110113033444.000|TR0|She joins us now with the latest.
20110113033444.000|20110113033446.000|TR0|
20110113033446.000|20110113033448.000|TR0|Randi, what did you learn today?
20110113033448.000|20110113033451.000|TR0|
20110113033451.000|20110113033453.000|TR0|RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Anderson, 
20110113033453.000|20110113033455.000|TR0|there were three new tidbits of 
20110113033455.000|20110113033458.000|TR0|information coming out today, each of them 
20110113033458.000|20110113033500.000|TR0|significant. And I'll just run through 
20110113033500.000|20110113033503.000|TR0|them quickly for you.
20110113033503.000|20110113033505.000|TR0|
20110113033505.000|20110113033507.000|TR0|Investigators are now looking for a black 
20110113033507.000|20110113033510.000|TR0|bag.  Apparently, Jared Lee Loughner had a 
20110113033510.000|20110113033512.000|TR0|conversation in his front yard with his 
20110113033512.000|20110113033514.000|TR0|father the morning of the shooting, 
20110113033514.000|20110113033517.000|TR0|Saturday morning.  His father saw him with 
20110113033517.000|20110113033519.000|TR0|this black bag.  He asked him what's in 
20110113033519.000|20110113033521.000|TR0|it?  Where are you going with it?  What's 
20110113033521.000|20110113033524.000|TR0|that for?  And apparently, the suspect 
20110113033524.000|20110113033526.000|TR0|then took off.  His son took off, and he 
20110113033526.000|20110113033529.000|TR0|got in his truck.  His father actually got 
20110113033529.000|20110113033531.000|TR0|in his truck, tried to chase him down, 
20110113033531.000|20110113033533.000|TR0|didn't find him.
20110113033533.000|20110113033536.000|TR0|
20110113033536.000|20110113033538.000|TR0|We don't know what was in the bag, if he 
20110113033538.000|20110113033540.000|TR0|was possibly carrying ammunition or what.  
20110113033540.000|20110113033543.000|TR0|But as far as we know, the authorities are 
20110113033543.000|20110113033545.000|TR0|now looking to try to find that black bag.
20110113033545.000|20110113033547.000|TR0|
20110113033547.000|20110113033550.000|TR0|Another bit of information tonight, we 
20110113033550.000|20110113033552.000|TR0|know that at 7:30 in the morning on 
20110113033552.000|20110113033555.000|TR0|Saturday, two hours and 40 minutes before 
20110113033555.000|20110113033557.000|TR0|that shooting, the suspect was actually 
20110113033557.000|20110113033559.000|TR0|stopped at a red light, because he had run 
20110113033559.000|20110113033602.000|TR0|that red light.  He was stopped by 
20110113033602.000|20110113033604.000|TR0|officers from the Arizona Game and Fish.  
20110113033604.000|20110113033606.000|TR0|He was questioned and released.  They 
20110113033606.000|20110113033609.000|TR0|didn't think he had done much wrong, so 
20110113033609.000|20110113033611.000|TR0|they let him go on his way.
20110113033611.000|20110113033614.000|TR0|
20110113033614.000|20110113033616.000|TR0|And that's one of those moments, Anderson, 
20110113033616.000|20110113033618.000|TR0|where you just wonder, could that have 
20110113033618.000|20110113033621.000|TR0|changed the course of what happened over 
20110113033621.000|20110113033623.000|TR0|this terrible tragedy here?  And that also 
20110113033623.000|20110113033625.000|TR0|might have been why he may have taken a 
20110113033625.000|20110113033628.000|TR0|taxi, as we know, to the Safeway that 
20110113033628.000|20110113033630.000|TR0|morning.
20110113033630.000|20110113033632.000|TR0|
20110113033632.000|20110113033635.000|TR0|The last bit of information, new 
20110113033635.000|20110113033637.000|TR0|information coming out today is that we 
20110113033637.000|20110113033640.000|TR0|already knew that officers been to the 
20110113033640.000|20110113033642.000|TR0|Loughner home, and they had found an 
20110113033642.000|20110113033644.000|TR0|envelope with the congresswoman's name on 
20110113033644.000|20110113033647.000|TR0|it.       Now we found out today, we're 
20110113033647.000|20110113033649.000|TR0|told today that they also found a piece of 
20110113033649.000|20110113033651.000|TR0|paper in a locked box at the house.  And 
20110113033651.000|20110113033654.000|TR0|on that piece of paper was scrawled these 
20110113033654.000|20110113033656.000|TR0|words.  These are direct quotes, "Die cop, 
20110113033656.000|20110113033658.000|TR0|die bitch.  Assassination plans have been 
20110113033658.000|20110113033701.000|TR0|made."  That piece of paper with that 
20110113033701.000|20110113033703.000|TR0|writing was inside a locked box at the 
20110113033703.000|20110113033706.000|TR0|Loughner home, Anderson.
20110113033706.000|20110113033708.000|TR0|
20110113033708.000|20110113033710.000|TR0|COOPER:  Very disturbing writings indeed.  
20110113033710.000|20110113033713.000|TR0|Randi, appreciate that.
20110113033713.000|20110113033715.000|TR0|
20110113033715.000|20110113033717.000|TR0|Details may be tough to take for the 
20110113033717.000|20110113033720.000|TR0|families who have been through so much.  
20110113033720.000|20110113033722.000|TR0|We only hope that seeing justice done will 
20110113033722.000|20110113033724.000|TR0|provide some comfort in the days and 
20110113033724.000|20110113033727.000|TR0|months ahead.
20110113033727.000|20110113033729.000|TR0|
20110113033729.000|20110113033732.000|TR0|Over the last couple of days, we've heard 
20110113033732.000|20110113033734.000|TR0|just amazing stories of heroism, acts of 
20110113033734.000|20110113033736.000|TR0|unselfish love on Saturday in Tucson as a 
20110113033736.000|20110113033739.000|TR0|gunman fired his weapon at innocent people.
20110113033739.000|20110113033741.000|TR0|
20110113033741.000|20110113033743.000|TR0|Mary Reed was in the parking lot with her 
20110113033743.000|20110113033746.000|TR0|husband and two teenage kids.  She was 
20110113033746.000|20110113033748.000|TR0|standing next to her daughter, waiting to 
20110113033748.000|20110113033751.000|TR0|greet Congresswoman Giffords, when the 
20110113033751.000|20110113033753.000|TR0|carnage began.  She reacted as a parent as 
20110113033753.000|20110113033755.000|TR0|you hope a parent would, as any parent 
20110113033755.000|20110113033758.000|TR0|hopes they would, shielding her own child 
20110113033758.000|20110113033800.000|TR0|from harm.  Mary Reed was shot three 
20110113033800.000|20110113033802.000|TR0|times. She survived.  She joins us now, 
20110113033802.000|20110113033805.000|TR0|along with her husband, Tom, her daughter, 
20110113033805.000|20110113033807.000|TR0|Emma, and her son, Owen.
20110113033807.000|20110113033809.000|TR0|
20110113033809.000|20110113033812.000|TR0|Mary, your story is actually incredible.  
20110113033812.000|20110113033814.000|TR0|You were shot three times while shielding 
20110113033814.000|20110113033817.000|TR0|your daughter from the gunman.  When the 
20110113033817.000|20110113033819.000|TR0|shots rang out, did you know what was 
20110113033819.000|20110113033821.000|TR0|going on right away?
20110113033821.000|20110113033824.000|TR0|
20110113033824.000|20110113033826.000|TR0|MARY REED, SHOOTING SURVIVOR:  I didn't.  
20110113033826.000|20110113033828.000|TR0|Not until I actually felt the first shot 
20110113033828.000|20110113033831.000|TR0|at me.  He was probably ten feet away, and 
20110113033831.000|20110113033833.000|TR0|I was facing him, speaking with the 
20110113033833.000|20110113033835.000|TR0|Stoddards.  Unfortunately, Mr. Stoddard 
20110113033835.000|20110113033838.000|TR0|passed.
20110113033838.000|20110113033840.000|TR0|
20110113033840.000|20110113033843.000|TR0|I was shot, and then Mr. Stoddard 
20110113033843.000|20110113033845.000|TR0|immediately jumped in front of his wife 
20110113033845.000|20110113033847.000|TR0|and was shot.  And he continued down, the 
20110113033847.000|20110113033850.000|TR0|gunman continued down the line.
20110113033850.000|20110113033852.000|TR0|
20110113033852.000|20110113033854.000|TR0|You have to imagine how small a space this 
20110113033854.000|20110113033857.000|TR0|was.  We were between a brick wall, which 
20110113033857.000|20110113033859.000|TR0|was the store, and a stanion (ph), which 
20110113033859.000|20110113033901.000|TR0|was only a person and a half wide.
20110113033901.000|20110113033904.000|TR0|
20110113033904.000|20110113033906.000|TR0|When they were cleaning my wounds, the 
20110113033906.000|20110113033909.000|TR0|medic who cleaned my wounds is a war 
20110113033909.000|20110113033911.000|TR0|veteran, and he kept saying, "Oh, my God.  
20110113033911.000|20110113033913.000|TR0|Look at the amount of gunpowder on her."  
20110113033913.000|20110113033916.000|TR0|So he was quite close.  He went down the 
20110113033916.000|20110113033918.000|TR0|line shooting, and...
20110113033918.000|20110113033920.000|TR0|
20110113033920.000|20110113033923.000|TR0|COOPER:  He actually was just walking down 
20110113033923.000|20110113033925.000|TR0|the line shooting?
20110113033925.000|20110113033928.000|TR0|
20110113033928.000|20110113033930.000|TR0|REED:  It wasn't quite walking, but it 
20110113033930.000|20110113033932.000|TR0|wasn't running, either. He was moving 
20110113033932.000|20110113033935.000|TR0|quickly, and he shot me first here, and 
20110113033935.000|20110113033937.000|TR0|then Mr. Stoddard jumped in front of his 
20110113033937.000|20110113033939.000|TR0|wife.  We had just been speaking about 
20110113033939.000|20110113033942.000|TR0|college for Emma, and then -- and then I 
20110113033942.000|20110113033944.000|TR0|shoved Emma against the wall and put my 
20110113033944.000|20110113033946.000|TR0|arms on either side of her.  He shot in 
20110113033946.000|20110113033949.000|TR0|this arm, and then he shot me in the back 
20110113033949.000|20110113033951.000|TR0|as he passed.       After he passed, the 
20110113033951.000|20110113033954.000|TR0|lady behind me, standing in line, grabbed 
20110113033954.000|20110113033956.000|TR0|the next magazine.  You could hear him 
20110113033956.000|20110113033958.000|TR0|releasing the magazine in order to come 
20110113033958.000|20110113034001.000|TR0|back to put a new magazine in and come 
20110113034001.000|20110113034003.000|TR0|back.
20110113034003.000|20110113034005.000|TR0|
20110113034005.000|20110113034008.000|TR0|COOPER:  Emma, did you -- I mean, did you 
20110113034008.000|20110113034010.000|TR0|know right away when you heard the shots 
20110113034010.000|20110113034012.000|TR0|what was going on?  Did you know that you 
20110113034012.000|20110113034015.000|TR0|and your mom were in danger?
20110113034015.000|20110113034017.000|TR0|
20110113034017.000|20110113034020.000|TR0|EMMA MCMAHON, EYEWITNESS:  I did not, 
20110113034020.000|20110113034022.000|TR0|actually.  I thought they were fireworks.  
20110113034022.000|20110113034024.000|TR0|I thought somebody was just playing a 
20110113034024.000|20110113034027.000|TR0|prank and throwing fireworks at the 
20110113034027.000|20110113034029.000|TR0|congresswoman.  I didn't realize what was 
20110113034029.000|20110113034031.000|TR0|happening until I saw people crowding 
20110113034031.000|20110113034034.000|TR0|against the wall and screaming.
20110113034034.000|20110113034036.000|TR0|
20110113034036.000|20110113034038.000|TR0|So I kind of crowded against the wall, and 
20110113034038.000|20110113034041.000|TR0|I felt my mom over me. But it was over so 
20110113034041.000|20110113034043.000|TR0|fast.  It must have taken less than ten 
20110113034043.000|20110113034046.000|TR0|seconds. So it wasn't until really the 
20110113034046.000|20110113034048.000|TR0|whole thing was over that I realized what 
20110113034048.000|20110113034050.000|TR0|had happened.
20110113034050.000|20110113034053.000|TR0|
20110113034053.000|20110113034055.000|TR0|COOPER:  Your mom saved your life.
20110113034055.000|20110113034057.000|TR0|
20110113034057.000|20110113034100.000|TR0|E. MCMAHON:  Yes, she did.
20110113034100.000|20110113034102.000|TR0|
20110113034102.000|20110113034105.000|TR0|COOPER:  Tom...
20110113034105.000|20110113034107.000|TR0|
20110113034107.000|20110113034109.000|TR0|E. MCMAHON:  I'm just -- I'm so grateful 
20110113034109.000|20110113034112.000|TR0|for her, it's just unbelievable.
20110113034112.000|20110113034114.000|TR0|
20110113034114.000|20110113034116.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes.  I mean -- yes.  Incredible. 
20110113034116.000|20110113034119.000|TR0| I mean, Tom, you and your son were about 
20110113034119.000|20110113034121.000|TR0|ten feet away, which was far enough, 
20110113034121.000|20110113034123.000|TR0|luckily, to keep you out of the gunman's 
20110113034123.000|20110113034126.000|TR0|target zone.  Did you know that your wife 
20110113034126.000|20110113034128.000|TR0|and daughter, that Emma was in -- was, you 
20110113034128.000|20110113034131.000|TR0|know, was right there?
20110113034131.000|20110113034133.000|TR0|
20110113034133.000|20110113034135.000|TR0|TOM MCMAHON, EYEWITNESS:  I knew where my 
20110113034135.000|20110113034138.000|TR0|family was during the event.  Once I found 
20110113034138.000|20110113034140.000|TR0|out, realized that there was danger, my 
20110113034140.000|20110113034142.000|TR0|son was to my left.  I turned around and 
20110113034142.000|20110113034145.000|TR0|told him to run and basically chased him 
20110113034145.000|20110113034147.000|TR0|down the hallway.
20110113034147.000|20110113034149.000|TR0|
20110113034149.000|20110113034152.000|TR0|Once I found out, once I realized that he 
20110113034152.000|20110113034154.000|TR0|was out of danger, I then turned around 
20110113034154.000|20110113034157.000|TR0|and saw that the gunman was down on the 
20110113034157.000|20110113034159.000|TR0|ground and went to my wife's side, to see 
20110113034159.000|20110113034201.000|TR0|what the damage was, how she was wounded.  
20110113034201.000|20110113034204.000|TR0|I could tell she was wounded.  I could 
20110113034204.000|20110113034206.000|TR0|tell that Emma seemed OK, but that Mary 
20110113034206.000|20110113034208.000|TR0|needed my help.
20110113034208.000|20110113034211.000|TR0|
20110113034211.000|20110113034213.000|TR0|COOPER:  You must be incredibly proud of 
20110113034213.000|20110113034215.000|TR0|her.
20110113034215.000|20110113034218.000|TR0|
20110113034218.000|20110113034220.000|TR0|T. MCMAHON:  Of my wife, yes.  Very much.  
20110113034220.000|20110113034223.000|TR0|Very much proud of her.  I'm proud of my 
20110113034223.000|20110113034225.000|TR0|whole family for dealing with this.  I'm 
20110113034225.000|20110113034227.000|TR0|proud of my -- my wife for saving my 
20110113034227.000|20110113034230.000|TR0|daughter, and I'm very thankful that she's 
20110113034230.000|20110113034232.000|TR0|OK, that she -- it wasn't worse for us.  
20110113034232.000|20110113034234.000|TR0|As it could have been.
20110113034234.000|20110113034237.000|TR0|
20110113034237.000|20110113034239.000|TR0|COOPER:  Owen -- yes.  Owen, was it scary 
20110113034239.000|20110113034241.000|TR0|when the shots rang out?  I mean, did it 
20110113034241.000|20110113034244.000|TR0|seem real to you?
20110113034244.000|20110113034246.000|TR0|
20110113034246.000|20110113034249.000|TR0|OWEN MCMAHON, EYEWITNESS:  I don't know, 
20110113034249.000|20110113034251.000|TR0|but it was very scary, definitely.  I kind 
20110113034251.000|20110113034253.000|TR0|of was already processing that these 
20110113034253.000|20110113034256.000|TR0|weren't fireworks, because we had been to 
20110113034256.000|20110113034258.000|TR0|New Mexico several times kind of, and we 
20110113034258.000|20110113034300.000|TR0|bought a few fireworks there because 
20110113034300.000|20110113034303.000|TR0|they're legal there.  And I'd also gone to 
20110113034303.000|20110113034305.000|TR0|the shooting range with my cousin, and we 
20110113034305.000|20110113034308.000|TR0|shot his guns, and it sounded closer to 
20110113034308.000|20110113034310.000|TR0|that.  So I was already processing "run."
20110113034310.000|20110113034312.000|TR0|
20110113034312.000|20110113034315.000|TR0|COOPER:  Right.  Emma, when you realized 
20110113034315.000|20110113034317.000|TR0|your mom had been shot three times, what 
20110113034317.000|20110113034319.000|TR0|did you do?
20110113034319.000|20110113034322.000|TR0|
20110113034322.000|20110113034324.000|TR0|E. MCMAHON:  I immediately called 911, and 
20110113034324.000|20110113034326.000|TR0|so I then walked over to the Walgreens.  I 
20110113034326.000|20110113034329.000|TR0|didn't know how bad it was.  At first I 
20110113034329.000|20110113034331.000|TR0|thought she was actually shot in the leg.  
20110113034331.000|20110113034334.000|TR0|So I walked over to the Walgreens until I 
20110113034334.000|20110113034336.000|TR0|got through to the Pima County Sheriff's 
20110113034336.000|20110113034338.000|TR0|Department.
20110113034338.000|20110113034341.000|TR0|
20110113034341.000|20110113034343.000|TR0|And then I immediately ran back to my mom. 
20110113034343.000|20110113034345.000|TR0| And the butchers brought out clean 
20110113034345.000|20110113034348.000|TR0|uniforms to be pushing into people's 
20110113034348.000|20110113034350.000|TR0|wounds, so I held that against her back.
20110113034350.000|20110113034352.000|TR0|
20110113034352.000|20110113034355.000|TR0|COOPER:  Mary, how are you doing now?
20110113034355.000|20110113034357.000|TR0|
20110113034357.000|20110113034400.000|TR0|REED:  I'm actually healing.  I'm quite 
20110113034400.000|20110113034402.000|TR0|sore, as I would -- I still have the 
20110113034402.000|20110113034404.000|TR0|bullets, as memories inside of me, and I 
20110113034404.000|20110113034407.000|TR0|-- I'm just quite sore.  The back, in 
20110113034407.000|20110113034409.000|TR0|particular, traveled along from my mid 
20110113034409.000|20110113034411.000|TR0|back all the way to but not through my 
20110113034411.000|20110113034414.000|TR0|spine.
20110113034414.000|20110113034416.000|TR0|
20110113034416.000|20110113034418.000|TR0|So I was extremely lucky that, with three 
20110113034418.000|20110113034421.000|TR0|rounds, it hit -- didn't hit an artery, a 
20110113034421.000|20110113034423.000|TR0|vein, a major organ, any organ or a bone.
20110113034423.000|20110113034426.000|TR0|
20110113034426.000|20110113034428.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes.
20110113034428.000|20110113034430.000|TR0|
20110113034430.000|20110113034433.000|TR0|REED:  So I am incredibly lucky.
20110113034433.000|20110113034435.000|TR0|
20110113034435.000|20110113034437.000|TR0|COOPER:  Incredibly brave.  I mean, just 
20110113034437.000|20110113034440.000|TR0|amazing.  You saved your daughter's life.  
20110113034440.000|20110113034442.000|TR0|Just very briefly, Mary, what was it like 
20110113034442.000|20110113034445.000|TR0|being there tonight?  I mean, from the 
20110113034445.000|20110113034447.000|TR0|president's remarks.  Did they -- did you 
20110113034447.000|20110113034449.000|TR0|hear what you wanted to hear?
20110113034449.000|20110113034452.000|TR0|
20110113034452.000|20110113034454.000|TR0|REED:  Anderson, I was overwhelmed with 
20110113034454.000|20110113034456.000|TR0|seeing the woman that was standing behind 
20110113034456.000|20110113034459.000|TR0|me that actually grabbed the magazine out 
20110113034459.000|20110113034501.000|TR0|of the gunman's hand.
20110113034501.000|20110113034503.000|TR0|
20110113034503.000|20110113034506.000|TR0|I -- I loved what President Obama said, in 
20110113034506.000|20110113034508.000|TR0|that -- that we have to be civil to each 
20110113034508.000|20110113034511.000|TR0|other.  We have to make our children proud 
20110113034511.000|20110113034513.000|TR0|of us. We need to honor our -- the 
20110113034513.000|20110113034515.000|TR0|9-year-old girls and boys in this world 
20110113034515.000|20110113034518.000|TR0|and do the right thing.  And so for that, 
20110113034518.000|20110113034520.000|TR0|I was very grateful.  It was a gracious 
20110113034520.000|20110113034522.000|TR0|speech.  My 13-year-old even stayed awake 
20110113034522.000|20110113034525.000|TR0|through the whole speech, so it had to be 
20110113034525.000|20110113034527.000|TR0|very, very inspirational.
20110113034527.000|20110113034529.000|TR0|
20110113034529.000|20110113034532.000|TR0|But I was overwhelmed by seeing the people 
20110113034532.000|20110113034534.000|TR0|that I was actually standing in line next 
20110113034534.000|20110113034537.000|TR0|to, talking to, as the shots rang out.
20110113034537.000|20110113034539.000|TR0|
20110113034539.000|20110113034541.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, Mary, Tom, Emma, Owen, I 
20110113034541.000|20110113034544.000|TR0|appreciate you being with us.  I'm so 
20110113034544.000|20110113034546.000|TR0|happy that you're all alive, and safe, and 
20110113034546.000|20110113034548.000|TR0|I know your thoughts are with those still 
20110113034548.000|20110113034551.000|TR0|recovering and still -- well, still 
20110113034551.000|20110113034553.000|TR0|dealing with the loss.  I appreciate all 
20110113034553.000|20110113034555.000|TR0|you being with us.  Thank you.
20110113034555.000|20110113034558.000|TR0|
20110113034558.000|20110113034600.000|TR0|REED:  Thank you.       COOPER:  Still 
20110113034600.000|20110113034603.000|TR0|ahead tonight, remembering Christina 
20110113034603.000|20110113034605.000|TR0|Taylor Green, just 9 years old.  What an 
20110113034605.000|20110113034607.000|TR0|enormous impression she has made in her 
20110113034607.000|20110113034610.000|TR0|short life.  We're going to hear from her 
20110113034610.000|20110113034612.000|TR0|family ahead.  I talked to her mom and 
20110113034612.000|20110113034614.000|TR0|dad.  You'll also meet her little brother.
20110113034614.000|20110113034617.000|TR0|
20110113034617.000|20110113034619.000|TR0|Also more on Congresswoman Giffords' 
20110113034619.000|20110113034622.000|TR0|recovery.  We're joined by House Minority 
20110113034622.000|20110113034624.000|TR0|Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was by the 
20110113034624.000|20110113034626.000|TR0|congresswoman's side when she opened her 
20110113034626.000|20110113034629.000|TR0|eyes.

20110113034636.000|20110113034638.000|TR0|COOPER:  President Obama brought the crowd 
20110113034638.000|20110113034640.000|TR0|to its feet tonight when he departed from 
20110113034640.000|20110113034643.000|TR0|the prepared text of his speech to reveal 
20110113034643.000|20110113034645.000|TR0|that Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, 
20110113034645.000|20110113034648.000|TR0|shot through the head on Saturday, opened 
20110113034648.000|20110113034650.000|TR0|her eyes today.
20110113034650.000|20110113034652.000|TR0|
20110113034652.000|20110113034655.000|TR0|House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi was 
20110113034655.000|20110113034657.000|TR0|there in the hospital room with her when 
20110113034657.000|20110113034659.000|TR0|it happened.  She joins us now by phone.
20110113034659.000|20110113034702.000|TR0|
20110113034702.000|20110113034704.000|TR0|Congresswoman Pelosi, what was that moment 
20110113034704.000|20110113034706.000|TR0|like?
20110113034706.000|20110113034709.000|TR0|
20110113034709.000|20110113034711.000|TR0|REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER 
20110113034711.000|20110113034714.000|TR0|(via phone):  Well, it was, as you can 
20110113034714.000|20110113034716.000|TR0|just imagine, a glorious moment.  My 
20110113034716.000|20110113034718.000|TR0|colleagues, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman 
20110113034718.000|20110113034721.000|TR0|Schultz and Kirsten Gillibrand were 
20110113034721.000|20110113034723.000|TR0|invited by the family to visit Gabby, 
20110113034723.000|20110113034725.000|TR0|which we considered to be an honor, being 
20110113034725.000|20110113034728.000|TR0|there with her parents and her husband, 
20110113034728.000|20110113034730.000|TR0|Mark Kelly.
20110113034730.000|20110113034732.000|TR0|
20110113034732.000|20110113034735.000|TR0|It was a girl power moment because we were 
20110113034735.000|20110113034737.000|TR0|striving -- amusing and reminding of 
20110113034737.000|20110113034740.000|TR0|things that she was going to come back to 
20110113034740.000|20110113034742.000|TR0|when she came to the Congress.  And then 
20110113034742.000|20110113034744.000|TR0|she opened her eyes, and her husband -- 
20110113034744.000|20110113034747.000|TR0|she looked at her husband and responded to 
20110113034747.000|20110113034749.000|TR0|comments that he made. And it was like a 
20110113034749.000|20110113034751.000|TR0|miracle.  Really.  It was something so 
20110113034751.000|20110113034754.000|TR0|spectacular.
20110113034754.000|20110113034756.000|TR0|
20110113034756.000|20110113034759.000|TR0|We chalk it up to girl power, but I think 
20110113034759.000|20110113034801.000|TR0|it's largely due to the magnificent care 
20110113034801.000|20110113034803.000|TR0|she is receiving at the University of 
20110113034803.000|20110113034806.000|TR0|Arizona Medical Center.  The love of her 
20110113034806.000|20110113034808.000|TR0|family, and, well, like those moments, the 
20110113034808.000|20110113034810.000|TR0|love of her friends.  The president and 
20110113034810.000|20110113034813.000|TR0|the first lady had just been in the room, 
20110113034813.000|20110113034815.000|TR0|so I think it all contributed to that 
20110113034815.000|20110113034817.000|TR0|glorious moment.
20110113034817.000|20110113034820.000|TR0|
20110113034820.000|20110113034822.000|TR0|COOPER:  And what was it like being in 
20110113034822.000|20110113034825.000|TR0|that hall tonight hearing the president 
20110113034825.000|20110113034827.000|TR0|speak?
20110113034827.000|20110113034829.000|TR0|
20110113034829.000|20110113034832.000|TR0|PELOSI:  Well, all of us had -- a number 
20110113034832.000|20110113034834.000|TR0|of us had gone to Arizona to pay our 
20110113034834.000|20110113034836.000|TR0|respects to those who lost their loved 
20110113034836.000|20110113034839.000|TR0|ones and to -- to meet the families of 
20110113034839.000|20110113034841.000|TR0|those who were injured, to meet Gabby's 
20110113034841.000|20110113034843.000|TR0|staff and the rest and thank the medical 
20110113034843.000|20110113034846.000|TR0|-- and the medical caregivers at the 
20110113034846.000|20110113034848.000|TR0|University Medical Center.
20110113034848.000|20110113034851.000|TR0|
20110113034851.000|20110113034853.000|TR0|So when the president spoke in such a 
20110113034853.000|20110113034855.000|TR0|particular way that each and every person 
20110113034855.000|20110113034858.000|TR0|who was lost on Saturday and when he 
20110113034858.000|20110113034900.000|TR0|challenged us to honor their memory by 
20110113034900.000|20110113034902.000|TR0|having a debate, a conversation worthy of 
20110113034902.000|20110113034905.000|TR0|those people and their sacrifice.  It was 
20110113034905.000|20110113034907.000|TR0|very -- it was really transforming for the 
20110113034907.000|20110113034909.000|TR0|audience.
20110113034909.000|20110113034912.000|TR0|
20110113034912.000|20110113034914.000|TR0|And it was a special speech, I think, for 
20110113034914.000|20110113034917.000|TR0|the president, as well. I think he moved 
20110113034917.000|20110113034919.000|TR0|the country with the speech.  That's how 
20110113034919.000|20110113034921.000|TR0|it seemed in the hall.
20110113034921.000|20110113034924.000|TR0|
20110113034924.000|20110113034926.000|TR0|COOPER:  Do you think the tone will change?
20110113034926.000|20110113034928.000|TR0|
20110113034928.000|20110113034931.000|TR0|PELOSI:  Well, I certainly hope so.  I 
20110113034931.000|20110113034933.000|TR0|don't see why it would not.  We all, as 
20110113034933.000|20110113034936.000|TR0|the lovely young man, Daniel Hernandez 
20110113034936.000|20110113034938.000|TR0|said, we are one country.  We have that 
20110113034938.000|20110113034940.000|TR0|common bond.  And as the president said, 
20110113034940.000|20110113034943.000|TR0|we have much more that binds us together 
20110113034943.000|20110113034945.000|TR0|than that which separates us.  I would 
20110113034945.000|20110113034947.000|TR0|certainly hope so.
20110113034947.000|20110113034950.000|TR0|
20110113034950.000|20110113034952.000|TR0|COOPER:  Minority Leader Pelosi, I

20110113035016.000|20110113035018.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, President Obama mentioned 
20110113035018.000|20110113035020.000|TR0|Christina Taylor Green numerous times 
20110113035020.000|20110113035023.000|TR0|tonight, the youngest shooting victim.  
20110113035023.000|20110113035025.000|TR0|Her story has broken a lot of hearts.
20110113035025.000|20110113035028.000|TR0|
20110113035028.000|20110113035030.000|TR0|Christina was just 9 years old, by all 
20110113035030.000|20110113035032.000|TR0|accounts, a very, very special little 
20110113035032.000|20110113035035.000|TR0|girl.  A third grader, recently elected to 
20110113035035.000|20110113035037.000|TR0|her student council.  She wanted to meet 
20110113035037.000|20110113035039.000|TR0|her congresswoman.  She was interested in 
20110113035039.000|20110113035042.000|TR0|government.  Christina's family is going 
20110113035042.000|20110113035044.000|TR0|to bury her tomorrow.
20110113035044.000|20110113035046.000|TR0|
20110113035046.000|20110113035049.000|TR0|Before tonight's memorial service, 
20110113035049.000|20110113035051.000|TR0|President Obama met with her family, her 
20110113035051.000|20110113035054.000|TR0|parents Roxanna and John, and her older 
20110113035054.000|20110113035056.000|TR0|brother, Dallas. I spoke to them earlier.

20110113035103.000|20110113035105.000|TR0|COOPER:  So John and Roxanna, it's been 
20110113035105.000|20110113035108.000|TR0|four days since the shooting.  How are you 
20110113035108.000|20110113035110.000|TR0|both holding up?
20110113035110.000|20110113035112.000|TR0|
20110113035112.000|20110113035115.000|TR0|ROXANNA GREEN, MOTHER OF CHRISTINA:  It's 
20110113035115.000|20110113035117.000|TR0|minute by minute, day by day.  We're just 
20110113035117.000|20110113035120.000|TR0|taking it slow.  We're hanging in there; 
20110113035120.000|20110113035122.000|TR0|we're trying to be strong.  We have to be 
20110113035122.000|20110113035124.000|TR0|strong.  Our country's being strong.  Our 
20110113035124.000|20110113035127.000|TR0|community is being strong for us.  So we 
20110113035127.000|20110113035129.000|TR0|will, you know, get through this with our 
20110113035129.000|20110113035131.000|TR0|faith and our friends and our family.
20110113035131.000|20110113035134.000|TR0|
20110113035134.000|20110113035136.000|TR0|COOPER:  Do you feel all the -- I mean, 
20110113035136.000|20110113035139.000|TR0|the love and the thoughts that so many 
20110113035139.000|20110113035141.000|TR0|people have for you and for Christina 
20110113035141.000|20110113035143.000|TR0|right now?
20110113035143.000|20110113035146.000|TR0|
20110113035146.000|20110113035148.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  Yes, we certainly do.  We 
20110113035148.000|20110113035150.000|TR0|appreciate everything that everyone's done 
20110113035150.000|20110113035153.000|TR0|for us, and we do feel the love.  And that 
20110113035153.000|20110113035155.000|TR0|kind of makes it a lot easier to have 
20110113035155.000|20110113035157.000|TR0|everyone, you know, trying to take care of 
20110113035157.000|20110113035200.000|TR0|us and be there for us.
20110113035200.000|20110113035202.000|TR0|
20110113035202.000|20110113035205.000|TR0|JOHN GREEN, FATHER OF CHRISTINA:  People 
20110113035205.000|20110113035207.000|TR0|from all over the country have touched our 
20110113035207.000|20110113035209.000|TR0|family.  It's been a really tough time for 
20110113035209.000|20110113035212.000|TR0|us, but, you know, the fire department of 
20110113035212.000|20110113035214.000|TR0|New York is sending the 9/11 flag out for 
20110113035214.000|20110113035216.000|TR0|Christina, for her service tomorrow.  And, 
20110113035216.000|20110113035219.000|TR0|you know, people have all over, 
20110113035219.000|20110113035221.000|TR0|California, the East Coast, my parents 
20110113035221.000|20110113035223.000|TR0|came from overseas.
20110113035223.000|20110113035226.000|TR0|
20110113035226.000|20110113035228.000|TR0|The help we've had in Tucson has been 
20110113035228.000|20110113035231.000|TR0|unbelievable.  Law enforcement, it's just 
20110113035231.000|20110113035233.000|TR0|-- I don't think we could have done it 
20110113035233.000|20110113035235.000|TR0|without everybody.  And it makes us 
20110113035235.000|20110113035238.000|TR0|certainly feel good about our -- people 
20110113035238.000|20110113035240.000|TR0|close to us and definitely about our 
20110113035240.000|20110113035242.000|TR0|country.
20110113035242.000|20110113035245.000|TR0|
20110113035245.000|20110113035247.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes, John, for those who don't 
20110113035247.000|20110113035249.000|TR0|know, obviously, Christina was born on 
20110113035249.000|20110113035252.000|TR0|9/11.  And as you said, a firefighter is 
20110113035252.000|20110113035254.000|TR0|coming down from New York with an actual 
20110113035254.000|20110113035257.000|TR0|flag that was recovered from the World 
20110113035257.000|20110113035259.000|TR0|Trade Center site.  When you heard that, 
20110113035259.000|20110113035301.000|TR0|what -- what meaning does that have for 
20110113035301.000|20110113035304.000|TR0|you that it's going to be displayed at her 
20110113035304.000|20110113035306.000|TR0|funeral tomorrow?
20110113035306.000|20110113035308.000|TR0|
20110113035308.000|20110113035311.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  Roxanna and I both let out a 
20110113035311.000|20110113035313.000|TR0|gasp, really, of emotion, because, you 
20110113035313.000|20110113035316.000|TR0|know, that meant a lot to us and for them 
20110113035316.000|20110113035318.000|TR0|to extend that courtesy to our daughter.  
20110113035318.000|20110113035320.000|TR0|Again, it's just another one of those 
20110113035320.000|20110113035323.000|TR0|things that will help, for us.  We feel 
20110113035323.000|20110113035325.000|TR0|like the country won't forget her.
20110113035325.000|20110113035327.000|TR0|
20110113035327.000|20110113035330.000|TR0|COOPER:  John, you just came from a 
20110113035330.000|20110113035332.000|TR0|meeting with President Obama. What did the 
20110113035332.000|20110113035334.000|TR0|president say to you?
20110113035334.000|20110113035337.000|TR0|
20110113035337.000|20110113035339.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  He expressed that there are no 
20110113035339.000|20110113035342.000|TR0|words, and to stay strong and believe in 
20110113035342.000|20110113035344.000|TR0|our country.  And we've -- one thing we 
20110113035344.000|20110113035346.000|TR0|promised him is we would do that.  We did 
20110113035346.000|20110113035349.000|TR0|take our family to -- Christina and Dallas 
20110113035349.000|20110113035351.000|TR0|and Roxanna and I went to D.C. right after 
20110113035351.000|20110113035353.000|TR0|he got elected.  And we had such a 
20110113035353.000|20110113035356.000|TR0|wonderful time in Washington, D.C., and, 
20110113035356.000|20110113035358.000|TR0|you know, we're going to...
20110113035358.000|20110113035400.000|TR0|
20110113035400.000|20110113035403.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  We're going to go back.

20110113035419.000|20110113035422.000|TR0|to come in and see everybody.  So I think 
20110113035422.000|20110113035424.000|TR0|he was excited about that, and we would be 
20110113035424.000|20110113035426.000|TR0|proud to be a part of that.  And I know 
20110113035426.000|20110113035429.000|TR0|Christina, you know, her -- that's 
20110113035429.000|20110113035431.000|TR0|something she would have loved to do.
20110113035431.000|20110113035434.000|TR0|
20110113035434.000|20110113035436.000|TR0|COOPER:  Roxanne, I know you -- we talked 
20110113035436.000|20110113035438.000|TR0|before, that the president had called you, 
20110113035438.000|20110113035441.000|TR0|and you said it was one of best phone 
20110113035441.000|20110113035443.000|TR0|calls you had ever gotten.  What was it 
20110113035443.000|20110113035445.000|TR0|like for you?  What did the president say 
20110113035445.000|20110113035448.000|TR0|to you?
20110113035448.000|20110113035450.000|TR0|
20110113035450.000|20110113035453.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  Well, I was honored to meet him 
20110113035453.000|20110113035455.000|TR0|and his wife and all the other people 
20110113035455.000|20110113035457.000|TR0|today.  You know, there -- there aren't 
20110113035457.000|20110113035500.000|TR0|any words, but just for them to show their 
20110113035500.000|20110113035502.000|TR0|love and support and be there for us, it's 
20110113035502.000|20110113035504.000|TR0|comforting.
20110113035504.000|20110113035507.000|TR0|
20110113035507.000|20110113035509.000|TR0|COOPER:  Obviously for Dallas, this is 
20110113035509.000|20110113035511.000|TR0|incredibly tough, and how do you feel he's 
20110113035511.000|20110113035514.000|TR0|doing?
20110113035514.000|20110113035516.000|TR0|
20110113035516.000|20110113035519.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  I think he's doing very well.  
20110113035519.000|20110113035521.000|TR0|He's very brave.  He's very strong, just 
20110113035521.000|20110113035523.000|TR0|like his sister.
20110113035523.000|20110113035526.000|TR0|
20110113035526.000|20110113035528.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  How are you doing, buddy?
20110113035528.000|20110113035530.000|TR0|
20110113035530.000|20110113035533.000|TR0|DALLAS GREEN, BROTHER OF CHRISTINA:  Good.
20110113035533.000|20110113035535.000|TR0|
20110113035535.000|20110113035537.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  Good.
20110113035537.000|20110113035540.000|TR0|
20110113035540.000|20110113035542.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  He's doing good.  He's doing a 
20110113035542.000|20110113035545.000|TR0|lot better.
20110113035545.000|20110113035547.000|TR0|
20110113035547.000|20110113035549.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  We know you miss your sister, 
20110113035549.000|20110113035552.000|TR0|but he'll be strong.
20110113035552.000|20110113035554.000|TR0|
20110113035554.000|20110113035556.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  He's going to be strong.
20110113035556.000|20110113035559.000|TR0|
20110113035559.000|20110113035601.000|TR0|COOPER:  And you guys have set up a 
20110113035601.000|20110113035603.000|TR0|memorial fund under Christina's name.
20110113035603.000|20110113035606.000|TR0|
20110113035606.000|20110113035608.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  The Christina Taylor Green 
20110113035608.000|20110113035611.000|TR0|memorial fund.  We have set up that in 
20110113035611.000|20110113035613.000|TR0|honor of her.  And there's -- there's been 
20110113035613.000|20110113035615.000|TR0|so many other people that have -- that 
20110113035615.000|20110113035618.000|TR0|have offered to set up other funds.  We 
20110113035618.000|20110113035620.000|TR0|don't really have -- we can't wrap 
20110113035620.000|20110113035622.000|TR0|ourselves around all those yet at this 
20110113035622.000|20110113035625.000|TR0|point, but we have a memorial fund for her.
20110113035625.000|20110113035627.000|TR0|
20110113035627.000|20110113035630.000|TR0|It's going to help children less fortunate 
20110113035630.000|20110113035632.000|TR0|in the area of northwest Tucson.  And, you 
20110113035632.000|20110113035634.000|TR0|know, people -- people have come forward 
20110113035634.000|20110113035637.000|TR0|and offered to name Little League parks 
20110113035637.000|20110113035639.000|TR0|after her and things like that, which 
20110113035639.000|20110113035641.000|TR0|we're deeply honored.  But something we 
20110113035641.000|20110113035644.000|TR0|know she would be proud of is to have 
20110113035644.000|20110113035646.000|TR0|whatever money comes in to help kids in 
20110113035646.000|20110113035648.000|TR0|our community that need some help.
20110113035648.000|20110113035651.000|TR0|
20110113035651.000|20110113035653.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  With education money, so they 
20110113035653.000|20110113035656.000|TR0|can fulfill their dreams.
20110113035656.000|20110113035658.000|TR0|
20110113035658.000|20110113035700.000|TR0|COOPER:  I'm not sure if you -- this may 
20110113035700.000|20110113035703.000|TR0|be -- I don't want to ask an inappropriate 
20110113035703.000|20110113035705.000|TR0|question, and if you don't want to answer 
20110113035705.000|20110113035707.000|TR0|this, that's fine.  I know the Loughner 
20110113035707.000|20110113035710.000|TR0|family had put out a statement just saying 
20110113035710.000|20110113035712.000|TR0|how sorry they were.  I wondered if you 
20110113035712.000|20110113035714.000|TR0|had a reaction to that.
20110113035714.000|20110113035717.000|TR0|
20110113035717.000|20110113035719.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  I think -- I would welcome 
20110113035719.000|20110113035722.000|TR0|that.  I mean, the family certainly, I'm 
20110113035722.000|20110113035724.000|TR0|sure the mother and father -- I don't know 
20110113035724.000|20110113035726.000|TR0|them at all, so I guess I'll have to look 
20110113035726.000|20110113035729.000|TR0|them in the eye before I took that, but 
20110113035729.000|20110113035731.000|TR0|it's -- it wasn't their act that did this. 
20110113035731.000|20110113035733.000|TR0| Their son -- they're not necessarily 
20110113035733.000|20110113035736.000|TR0|responsible for this.
20110113035736.000|20110113035738.000|TR0|
20110113035738.000|20110113035740.000|TR0|So I don't know the circumstances behind 
20110113035740.000|20110113035743.000|TR0|that.  Before I took that apology, though, 
20110113035743.000|20110113035745.000|TR0|I'd find that out.
20110113035745.000|20110113035748.000|TR0|
20110113035748.000|20110113035750.000|TR0|COOPER:  And finally, you know, this is an 
20110113035750.000|20110113035752.000|TR0|age where a lot of folks grow very cynical 
20110113035752.000|20110113035755.000|TR0|about government.  You know, for Christina 
20110113035755.000|20110113035757.000|TR0|at age nine to have been interested in 
20110113035757.000|20110113035759.000|TR0|politics and interested in the process and 
20110113035759.000|20110113035802.000|TR0|wanting to go to that Congresswoman on the 
20110113035802.000|20110113035804.000|TR0|corner event, what do you think it was 
20110113035804.000|20110113035807.000|TR0|that made her so interested, so passionate 
20110113035807.000|20110113035809.000|TR0|about it?
20110113035809.000|20110113035811.000|TR0|
20110113035811.000|20110113035814.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  She -- she has a very 
20110113035814.000|20110113035816.000|TR0|inquisitive mind.  She liked to know -- 
20110113035816.000|20110113035818.000|TR0|first of all, she liked to be in charge.  
20110113035818.000|20110113035821.000|TR0|So I think that's one thing.  She liked to 
20110113035821.000|20110113035823.000|TR0|be in charge.  And she was very ambitious. 
20110113035823.000|20110113035825.000|TR0|And she wanted to -- she liked things done 
20110113035825.000|20110113035828.000|TR0|her way.  And I think she was very fair 
20110113035828.000|20110113035830.000|TR0|minded about how things should be done.    
20110113035830.000|20110113035833.000|TR0| Again, I think if there were some 
20110113035833.000|20110113035835.000|TR0|injustices, I think she would have done 
20110113035835.000|20110113035837.000|TR0|her best to try to right those.
20110113035837.000|20110113035840.000|TR0|
20110113035840.000|20110113035842.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, again, John and Roxana, I 
20110113035842.000|20110113035844.000|TR0|appreciate you being with us.  The funeral
