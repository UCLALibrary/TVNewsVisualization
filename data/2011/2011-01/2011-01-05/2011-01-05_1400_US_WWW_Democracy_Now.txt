20110105141313.442|20110105141315.054|TR0|Republican strategy.
20110105141315.054|20110105141316.665|TR0|
20110105141316.665|20110105141318.276|TR0|>> REP. FRED UPTON: We have 242 
20110105141318.276|20110105141319.888|TR0|Republicans. There will be a 
20110105141319.888|20110105141321.499|TR0|significant number of Democrats, 
20110105141321.499|20110105141323.110|TR0|I think, that will join us. You 
20110105141323.110|20110105141324.722|TR0|will remember, when that vote 
20110105141324.722|20110105141326.333|TR0|passed in the House last March, 
20110105141326.333|20110105141327.944|TR0|it only passed by seven votes.
20110105141327.944|20110105141329.556|TR0|
20110105141329.556|20110105141331.167|TR0|>> CHRIS WALLACE: But you're not 
20110105141331.167|20110105141332.778|TR0|going to repeal it. I mean, if 
20110105141332.778|20110105141334.390|TR0|you vote in the House, it's not 
20110105141334.390|20110105141336.001|TR0|going to happen in the Senate.
20110105141336.001|20110105141337.612|TR0|
20110105141337.612|20110105141339.224|TR0|>> REP. FRED UPTON: Just wait. 
20110105141339.224|20110105141340.835|TR0|Just wait. It passed - if you 
20110105141340.835|20110105141342.446|TR0|switched four votes from last 
20110105141342.446|20110105141344.058|TR0|March, that bill would have gone 
20110105141344.058|20110105141345.669|TR0|down. So we'll take the 
20110105141345.669|20110105141347.280|TR0|Democrats that voted no, we'll 
20110105141347.280|20110105141348.892|TR0|take other Democrats who 
20110105141348.892|20110105141350.503|TR0|probably agree with Speaker 
20110105141350.503|20110105141352.114|TR0|Pelosi's statement - remember 
20110105141352.114|20110105141353.726|TR0|when she said we want to pass 
20110105141353.726|20110105141355.337|TR0|this thing because then we'll 
20110105141355.337|20110105141356.948|TR0|learn what's in it? Well, now 
20110105141356.948|20110105141358.560|TR0|the American public does know 
20110105141358.560|20110105141400.171|TR0|what's in it. Unpopularity 
20110105141400.171|20110105141401.782|TR0|numbers are as high as 60 
20110105141401.782|20110105141403.394|TR0|percent across the country. I 
20110105141403.394|20110105141405.005|TR0|don't think we're going to be 
20110105141405.005|20110105141406.616|TR0|that far off from having the 
20110105141406.616|20110105141408.228|TR0|votes to actually override a 
20110105141408.228|20110105141409.839|TR0|veto. Remember President 
20110105141409.839|20110105141411.450|TR0|Clinton? It took him three times 
20110105141411.450|20110105141413.062|TR0|before he signed welfare reform. 
20110105141413.062|20110105141414.673|TR0|If we pass this bill with a 
20110105141414.673|20110105141416.284|TR0|sizable vote - and I think that 
20110105141416.284|20110105141417.896|TR0|we will - it'll put enormous 
20110105141417.896|20110105141419.507|TR0|pressure on the Senate to do 
20110105141419.507|20110105141421.118|TR0|perhaps the same thing.
20110105141421.118|20110105141422.730|TR0|
20110105141422.730|20110105141424.341|TR0|But then, after that, we're 
20110105141424.341|20110105141425.952|TR0|going to go after this bill 
20110105141425.952|20110105141427.564|TR0|piece by piece. We'll look at 
20110105141427.564|20110105141429.175|TR0|the 1099 issue in Dave Camp's 
20110105141429.175|20110105141430.786|TR0|committee, Ways and Means, to 
20110105141430.786|20110105141432.398|TR0|look at the $600 1099 that has 
20110105141432.398|20110105141434.009|TR0|to be processed for every 
20110105141434.009|20110105141435.621|TR0|business-to-business action. 
20110105141435.621|20110105141437.232|TR0|We'll look at the individual 
20110105141437.232|20110105141438.843|TR0|mandate requirement. We'll look 
20110105141438.843|20110105141440.455|TR0|at all those as individual 
20110105141440.455|20110105141442.066|TR0|pieces. We're going to take up 
20110105141442.066|20110105141443.677|TR0|early, I think, the Pitt-Stupak 
20110105141443.677|20110105141445.289|TR0|language - no funds shall be 
20110105141445.289|20110105141446.900|TR0|spent on abortion - as a 
20110105141446.900|20110105141448.511|TR0|separate bill early on, and 
20110105141448.511|20110105141450.123|TR0|we'll look at these individual 
20110105141450.123|20110105141451.734|TR0|pieces to see if we can't have 
20110105141451.734|20110105141453.345|TR0|the thing crumble.
20110105141453.345|20110105141454.957|TR0|
20110105141454.957|20110105141456.568|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Even 
20110105141456.568|20110105141458.179|TR0|before the repeal vote takes 
20110105141458.179|20110105141459.791|TR0|place, Republicans can lay claim 
20110105141459.791|20110105141501.402|TR0|to a key victory in the 
20110105141501.402|20110105141503.013|TR0|healthcare battle. On Tuesday, 
20110105141503.013|20110105141504.625|TR0|the Obama administration said it 
20110105141504.625|20110105141506.236|TR0|would reverse a regulation that 
20110105141506.236|20110105141507.847|TR0|would have covered end-of-life 
20110105141507.847|20110105141509.459|TR0|planning for Medicare 
20110105141509.459|20110105141511.070|TR0|beneficiaries during their 
20110105141511.070|20110105141512.681|TR0|annual checkups. Government 
20110105141512.681|20110105141514.293|TR0|coverage of end-of-life care has 
20110105141514.293|20110105141515.904|TR0|sparked Republican accusations 
20110105141515.904|20110105141517.515|TR0|that Democrats are effectively 
20110105141517.515|20110105141519.127|TR0|imposing "death panels" that 
20110105141519.127|20110105141520.738|TR0|will determine who is worthy of 
20110105141520.738|20110105141522.349|TR0|treatment. It's the second time 
20110105141522.349|20110105141523.961|TR0|the Obama administration has 
20110105141523.961|20110105141525.572|TR0|dropped the end-of-life coverage 
20110105141525.572|20110105141527.183|TR0|provision after excluding a 
20110105141527.183|20110105141528.795|TR0|similar regulation from the bill 
20110105141528.795|20110105141530.406|TR0|signed by President Obama in 
20110105141530.406|20110105141532.017|TR0|March.

20110105141533.629|20110105141535.240|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: As the 
20110105141535.240|20110105141536.851|TR0|healthcare debate continues in 
20110105141536.851|20110105141538.463|TR0|Washington, well, today we have 
20110105141538.463|20110105141540.074|TR0|our own doctor in the house. We

20110105141541.685|20110105141543.297|TR0|most influential health policy

20110105141610.690|20110105141612.301|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Thanks for

20110105141615.524|20110105141617.135|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Why don't we 
20110105141617.135|20110105141618.746|TR0|start off with this change in 
20110105141618.746|20110105141620.358|TR0|the Obama administration this 
20110105141620.358|20110105141621.969|TR0|week that the Republicans were 
20110105141621.969|20110105141623.580|TR0|pushing for?
20110105141623.580|20110105141625.192|TR0|
20110105141625.192|20110105141626.803|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Well, this 
20110105141626.803|20110105141628.414|TR0|change, which is to remove 
20110105141628.414|20110105141630.026|TR0|provisions that would have 
20110105141630.026|20110105141631.637|TR0|allowed for doctors to have 
20110105141631.637|20110105141633.248|TR0|additional payments to have 
20110105141633.248|20110105141634.860|TR0|end-of-life discussions with 
20110105141634.860|20110105141636.471|TR0|their patients, is an example of 
20110105141636.471|20110105141638.082|TR0|the mistake that repeal 
20110105141638.082|20110105141639.694|TR0|represents as a whole. 
20110105141639.694|20110105141641.305|TR0|End-of-life discussions are not 
20110105141641.305|20110105141642.916|TR0|death panels. But you say it 
20110105141642.916|20110105141644.528|TR0|over and over again, you brand 
20110105141644.528|20110105141646.139|TR0|it over and over again, and you 
20110105141646.139|20110105141647.750|TR0|begin to define what the meaning 
20110105141647.750|20110105141649.362|TR0|is of a major policy that's 
20110105141649.362|20110105141650.973|TR0|passed. Being able to provide 
20110105141650.973|20110105141652.584|TR0|funding for discussions that 
20110105141652.584|20110105141654.196|TR0|have been shown to have a huge 
20110105141654.196|20110105141655.807|TR0|difference in improving the 
20110105141655.807|20110105141657.418|TR0|quality of life patients have 
20110105141657.418|20110105141659.030|TR0|and, in a recent study published 
20110105141659.030|20110105141700.641|TR0|in the New England Journal, also 
20110105141700.641|20110105141702.252|TR0|generated longer life for 
20110105141702.252|20110105141703.864|TR0|patients by helping them make 
20110105141703.864|20110105141705.475|TR0|better decisions about when to 
20110105141705.475|20110105141707.086|TR0|stop therapies that have become 
20110105141707.086|20110105141708.698|TR0|harmful to them, like that 
20110105141708.698|20110105141710.309|TR0|fourth round of chemotherapy and 
20110105141710.309|20110105141711.920|TR0|so on, those kinds of studies 
20110105141711.920|20110105141713.532|TR0|indicate we need more, longer 
20110105141713.532|20110105141715.143|TR0|and better discussions with 
20110105141715.143|20110105141716.754|TR0|doctors, overall. Repeal is a 
20110105141716.754|20110105141718.366|TR0|major mistake. Our choices are 
20110105141718.366|20110105141719.977|TR0|stalemate on making any kind of 
20110105141719.977|20110105141721.588|TR0|progress on healthcare at a time 
20110105141721.588|20110105141723.200|TR0|that the costs are going to be 
20110105141723.200|20110105141724.811|TR0|disastrous for our country over 
20110105141724.811|20110105141726.422|TR0|the next decade and at a time 
20110105141726.422|20110105141728.034|TR0|when more and more Americans are 
20110105141728.034|20110105141729.645|TR0|simply without health insurance.

20110105141731.256|20110105141732.868|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, let's talk 
20110105141732.868|20110105141734.479|TR0|about what these end-of-life 
20110105141734.479|20110105141736.090|TR0|discussions are about. You wrote 
20110105141736.090|20110105141737.702|TR0|a very moving piece and also, I 
20110105141737.702|20110105141739.313|TR0|think, surprising piece called 
20110105141739.313|20110105141740.924|TR0|"Letting Go: What Should

20110105141745.759|20110105141747.370|TR0|You looked at a number of cases 
20110105141747.370|20110105141748.981|TR0|of people at the end of life, 
20110105141748.981|20110105141750.593|TR0|and you also looked at studies, 
20110105141750.593|20110105141752.204|TR0|like the Aetna study. You looked 
20110105141752.204|20110105141753.815|TR0|at La Crosse, Wisconsin. You 
20110105141753.815|20110105141755.427|TR0|looked at what happens when 
20110105141755.427|20110105141757.038|TR0|people start talking about the 
20110105141757.038|20110105141758.649|TR0|end of life.

20110105141800.261|20110105141801.872|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Yeah, it 
20110105141801.872|20110105141803.483|TR0|started for me with a 
20110105141803.483|20110105141805.095|TR0|recognition that I was not doing 
20110105141805.095|20110105141806.706|TR0|a great job with my patients who 
20110105141806.706|20110105141808.317|TR0|had a terminal illness. And I 
20110105141808.317|20110105141809.929|TR0|centered the story I wrote 
20110105141809.929|20110105141811.540|TR0|around a 35-year-old patient of 
20110105141811.540|20110105141813.151|TR0|mine, Sara Monopoli, who was 
20110105141813.151|20110105141814.763|TR0|diagnosed with metastatic lung 
20110105141814.763|20110105141816.374|TR0|cancer, an incurable lung 
20110105141816.374|20110105141817.985|TR0|cancer, in her eighth month of 
20110105141817.985|20110105141819.597|TR0|pregnancy.
20110105141819.597|20110105141821.208|TR0|
20110105141821.208|20110105141822.819|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: With her first 
20110105141822.819|20110105141824.431|TR0|child.
20110105141824.431|20110105141826.042|TR0|
20110105141826.042|20110105141827.653|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: With her 
20110105141827.653|20110105141829.265|TR0|first baby. And I took care of 
20110105141829.265|20110105141830.876|TR0|her as one of a whole team of 
20110105141830.876|20110105141832.487|TR0|doctors, none of us quite ever 
20110105141832.487|20110105141834.099|TR0|being willing to sit down with 
20110105141834.099|20110105141835.710|TR0|her and say very clearly what 
20110105141835.710|20110105141837.321|TR0|she actually kind of already 
20110105141837.321|20110105141838.933|TR0|knew, which is that this cancer 
20110105141838.933|20110105141840.544|TR0|would not be cured, that - and 
20110105141840.544|20110105141842.155|TR0|how things would go towards the 
20110105141842.155|20110105141843.767|TR0|end, so she could plan for it. 
20110105141843.767|20110105141845.378|TR0|And so, right into the last 
20110105141845.378|20110105141846.989|TR0|days, she was onto her fourth 
20110105141846.989|20110105141848.601|TR0|round of chemotherapy into her - 
20110105141848.601|20110105141850.212|TR0|on to brain radiation, in and 
20110105141850.212|20110105141851.823|TR0|out of the hospital, suffering 
20110105141851.823|20110105141853.435|TR0|through the end. I'm not 
20110105141853.435|20110105141855.046|TR0|convinced, especially for our 
20110105141855.046|20110105141856.657|TR0|late stages of therapy, that we 
20110105141856.657|20110105141858.269|TR0|did any good. But the choice at 
20110105141858.269|20110105141859.880|TR0|every point along the way was, 
20110105141859.880|20110105141901.491|TR0|do you want to try this 
20110105141901.491|20110105141903.103|TR0|experimental therapy? Do you 
20110105141903.103|20110105141904.714|TR0|want to try this next treatment, 
20110105141904.714|20110105141906.325|TR0|for the lottery ticket chance 
20110105141906.325|20110105141907.937|TR0|that maybe you'd get a little 
20110105141907.937|20110105141909.548|TR0|bit more time out of it? And 
20110105141909.548|20110105141911.159|TR0|what we weren't willing to 
20110105141911.159|20110105141912.771|TR0|discuss was the most likely 
20110105141912.771|20110105141914.382|TR0|thing, which is, you wouldn't 
20110105141914.382|20110105141915.993|TR0|win the lottery ticket, that 
20110105141915.993|20110105141917.605|TR0|time would pass. And so, when 
20110105141917.605|20110105141919.216|TR0|she finally woke up one morning 
20110105141919.216|20110105141920.828|TR0|unable to breathe, that was the 
20110105141920.828|20110105141922.439|TR0|moment nobody was prepared for, 
20110105141922.439|20110105141924.050|TR0|including leading to the one 
20110105141924.050|20110105141925.662|TR0|thing she didn't want, which was 
20110105141925.662|20110105141927.273|TR0|to die in the hospital.
20110105141927.273|20110105141928.884|TR0|
20110105141928.884|20110105141930.496|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: You 
20110105141930.496|20110105141932.107|TR0|write in the piece about how the 
20110105141932.107|20110105141933.718|TR0|approach to dying has changed 
20110105141933.718|20110105141935.330|TR0|over time and what you call "the 
20110105141935.330|20110105141936.941|TR0|art of dying." Explain what you 
20110105141936.941|20110105141938.552|TR0|mean by that.
20110105141938.552|20110105141940.164|TR0|
20110105141940.164|20110105141941.775|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: So, we've 
20110105141941.775|20110105141943.386|TR0|had a millennium of developing 
20110105141943.386|20110105141944.998|TR0|the way that people die, with 
20110105141944.998|20110105141946.609|TR0|last rites and a kind of bedside 
20110105141946.609|20110105141948.220|TR0|vigil for people. You know, 
20110105141948.220|20110105141949.832|TR0|death used to be a brief 
20110105141949.832|20110105141951.443|TR0|unpredictable process. And now 
20110105141951.443|20110105141953.054|TR0|it is a long unpredictable 
20110105141953.054|20110105141954.666|TR0|process. Virtually everybody who 
20110105141954.666|20110105141956.277|TR0|passes away does not do so with 
20110105141956.277|20110105141957.888|TR0|a sudden heart attack, and 
20110105141957.888|20110105141959.500|TR0|that's that. It is a months-long 
20110105141959.500|20110105142001.111|TR0|dealing with a terminal cancer 
20110105142001.111|20110105142002.722|TR0|or a congestive heart failure 
20110105142002.722|20110105142004.334|TR0|and so on. And we do not have 
20110105142004.334|20110105142005.945|TR0|the rituals for how to even talk 
20110105142005.945|20110105142007.556|TR0|about what that process is like. 
20110105142007.556|20110105142009.168|TR0|What we do know is that patients 
20110105142009.168|20110105142010.779|TR0|want not only their best chance 
20110105142010.779|20110105142012.390|TR0|of living as long as possible, 
20110105142012.390|20110105142014.002|TR0|but a variety of other things 
20110105142014.002|20110105142015.613|TR0|medicine is really bad at 
20110105142015.613|20110105142017.224|TR0|helping people with, like 
20110105142017.224|20110105142018.836|TR0|reducing their suffering; 
20110105142018.836|20110105142020.447|TR0|maintaining - offering the 
20110105142020.447|20110105142022.058|TR0|chance for them to maintain as 
20110105142022.058|20110105142023.670|TR0|much control over their life, as 
20110105142023.670|20110105142025.281|TR0|their disease progresses, as 
20110105142025.281|20110105142026.892|TR0|possible; being able to spend 
20110105142026.892|20110105142028.504|TR0|time at home and with family. 
20110105142028.504|20110105142030.115|TR0|And this is where the - our 
20110105142030.115|20110105142031.726|TR0|failure comes from.
20110105142031.726|20110105142033.338|TR0|
20110105142033.338|20110105142034.949|TR0|The ability to even talk about 
20110105142034.949|20110105142036.560|TR0|this in the face of death panels 
20110105142036.560|20110105142038.172|TR0|is what troubles me. The idea 
20110105142038.172|20110105142039.783|TR0|that discussion, that trying new 
20110105142039.783|20110105142041.394|TR0|policies that might help people 
20110105142041.394|20110105142043.006|TR0|to make this stage of life and 
20110105142043.006|20110105142044.617|TR0|the way our healthcare system 
20110105142044.617|20110105142046.228|TR0|works for people when they have 
20110105142046.228|20110105142047.840|TR0|a terminal illness, make it work 
20110105142047.840|20110105142049.451|TR0|better - yes, there is no 
20110105142049.451|20110105142051.062|TR0|perfect solution off the shelf, 
20110105142051.062|20110105142052.674|TR0|but we start with what we know 
20110105142052.674|20110105142054.285|TR0|from great evidence. Only a 
20110105142054.285|20110105142055.897|TR0|quarter of patients have a 
20110105142055.897|20110105142057.508|TR0|decent discussion with their 
20110105142057.508|20110105142059.119|TR0|doctor who has a terminal 
20110105142059.119|20110105142100.731|TR0|cancer. Of those patients that 
20110105142100.731|20110105142102.342|TR0|have the discussion, they are 
20110105142102.342|20110105142103.953|TR0|less likely to die in the 
20110105142103.953|20110105142105.565|TR0|intensive care unit, more likely 
20110105142105.565|20110105142107.176|TR0|to have a better quality of life 
20110105142107.176|20110105142108.787|TR0|and less suffering at the end, 
20110105142108.787|20110105142110.399|TR0|do not have a shorter length of 
20110105142110.399|20110105142112.010|TR0|life, and six months later their 
20110105142112.010|20110105142113.621|TR0|family members are markedly less 
20110105142113.621|20110105142115.233|TR0|likely to be depressed. And this 
20110105142115.233|20110105142116.844|TR0|is what we don't want to talk 
20110105142116.844|20110105142118.455|TR0|about?
20110105142118.455|20110105142120.067|TR0|
20110105142120.067|20110105142121.678|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We're going to 
20110105142121.678|20110105142123.289|TR0|go to break. I was just 
20110105142123.289|20110105142124.901|TR0|astounded by some of the studies 
20110105142124.901|20110105142126.512|TR0|in your article that show that 
20110105142126.512|20110105142128.123|TR0|people who actually start to 
20110105142128.123|20110105142129.735|TR0|deal with hospice care at the 
20110105142129.735|20110105142131.346|TR0|end, a different way of dealing 
20110105142131.346|20110105142132.957|TR0|with death, actually lived 
20110105142132.957|20110105142134.569|TR0|longer, and also the issue of 
20110105142134.569|20110105142136.180|TR0|cost, because that's what we're 
20110105142136.180|20110105142137.791|TR0|seeing in Congress right now as

20110105142219.686|20110105142221.297|TR0|revived in recent weeks after

20110105142304.804|20110105142306.415|TR0|now they've been made part of a

20110105142308.026|20110105142309.638|TR0|idea, if you can't legislate it, 
20110105142309.638|20110105142311.249|TR0|enforce it.

20110105142316.083|20110105142317.694|TR0|revived? After furious, hot

20110105142418.925|20110105142420.537|TR0|have now an immense number of 
20110105142420.537|20110105142422.148|TR0|studies showing that discussions 
20110105142422.148|20110105142423.759|TR0|with doctors are beneficial, 
20110105142423.759|20110105142425.371|TR0|they are too short, and being 
20110105142425.371|20110105142426.982|TR0|able to have time to have real, 
20110105142426.982|20110105142428.593|TR0|careful discussion about what

20110105142433.427|20110105142435.039|TR0|longer working, is absolutely 
20110105142435.039|20110105142436.650|TR0|crucial. This is not about a 
20110105142436.650|20110105142438.261|TR0|discussion of whether you will 
20110105142438.261|20110105142439.873|TR0|get that $100,000 treatment 
20110105142439.873|20110105142441.484|TR0|versus not get that $100,000

20110105142555.606|20110105142557.217|TR0|but have an incurable lung 
20110105142557.217|20110105142558.828|TR0|cancer, like my 35-year-old 
20110105142558.828|20110105142600.440|TR0|patient did, or you are 78 years 
20110105142600.440|20110105142602.051|TR0|old and have a congestive heart 
20110105142602.051|20110105142603.662|TR0|failure and you're on oxygen at 
20110105142603.662|20110105142605.274|TR0|home and it's a typical 
20110105142605.274|20110105142606.885|TR0|20-minute visit, there are a 
20110105142606.885|20110105142608.496|TR0|number of barriers to why that 
20110105142608.496|20110105142610.108|TR0|discussion doesn't happen. One 
20110105142610.108|20110105142611.719|TR0|is that paying for the extra 
20110105142611.719|20110105142613.330|TR0|time that these discussions 
20110105142613.330|20110105142614.942|TR0|take, emotions get opened up, 
20110105142614.942|20110105142616.553|TR0|and there's a need for a really 
20110105142616.553|20110105142618.164|TR0|good professional to walk 
20110105142618.164|20110105142619.776|TR0|through these moments with you, 
20110105142619.776|20110105142621.387|TR0|and no one wants to face them. 
20110105142621.387|20110105142622.998|TR0|The cost barrier is one. It's a 
20110105142622.998|20110105142624.610|TR0|tiny one. The big barriers that 
20110105142624.610|20110105142626.221|TR0|also play into it are the fact 
20110105142626.221|20110105142627.832|TR0|that neither the doctor nor the 
20110105142627.832|20110105142629.444|TR0|patient are comfortable with 
20110105142629.444|20110105142631.055|TR0|these discussions, and we're not 
20110105142631.055|20110105142632.666|TR0|good at them. Learning how to 
20110105142632.666|20110105142634.278|TR0|get good at them, getting that 
20110105142634.278|20110105142635.889|TR0|cost barrier out of the way, and 
20110105142635.889|20110105142637.500|TR0|making it simply part of our 
20110105142637.500|20110105142639.112|TR0|professional responsibility that 
20110105142639.112|20110105142640.723|TR0|we can help people just - even 
20110105142640.723|20110105142642.334|TR0|when we don't necessarily have 
20110105142642.334|20110105142643.946|TR0|great treatments for them, 
20110105142643.946|20110105142645.557|TR0|that's crucial.
20110105142645.557|20110105142647.168|TR0|
20110105142647.168|20110105142648.780|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Well, 
20110105142648.780|20110105142650.391|TR0|let's look at the bigger picture 
20110105142650.391|20110105142652.002|TR0|for a moment. So the Republicans 
20110105142652.002|20110105142653.614|TR0|are taking control of the House 
20110105142653.614|20110105142655.225|TR0|today, as we mentioned, and 
20110105142655.225|20110105142656.836|TR0|they've said that one of the top 
20110105142656.836|20110105142658.448|TR0|things on their agenda is to 
20110105142658.448|20110105142700.059|TR0|repeal the healthcare reform 
20110105142700.059|20110105142701.670|TR0|bill. You wrote, after the bill 
20110105142701.670|20110105142703.282|TR0|was signed - you made an analogy 
20110105142703.282|20110105142704.893|TR0|to what happened in 1965 when 
20110105142704.893|20110105142706.504|TR0|Johnson signed Medicare into 
20110105142706.504|20110105142708.116|TR0|law. Explain what happened then 
20110105142708.116|20110105142709.727|TR0|and what the analogy is to now.
20110105142709.727|20110105142711.339|TR0|
20110105142711.339|20110105142712.950|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Yeah, the 
20110105142712.950|20110105142714.561|TR0|week that the health reform bill 
20110105142714.561|20110105142716.173|TR0|passed, I wrote that we should 
20110105142716.173|20110105142717.784|TR0|be prepared for the war to come. 
20110105142717.784|20110105142719.395|TR0|We remember Medicare passing in 
20110105142719.395|20110105142721.007|TR0|1965 as this historic 
20110105142721.007|20110105142722.618|TR0|accomplishment that then went 
20110105142722.618|20110105142724.229|TR0|smoothly into becoming a 
20110105142724.229|20110105142725.841|TR0|healthcare program for everybody 
20110105142725.841|20110105142727.452|TR0|over 65, without any troubles 
20110105142727.452|20110105142729.063|TR0|along the way. But in fact, it 
20110105142729.063|20110105142730.675|TR0|was severely under attack from 
20110105142730.675|20110105142732.286|TR0|the moment it passed. Ten 
20110105142732.286|20110105142733.897|TR0|thousand physicians in the Ohio 
20110105142733.897|20110105142735.509|TR0|State Medical Association 
20110105142735.509|20110105142737.120|TR0|announced they would boycott any 
20110105142737.120|20110105142738.731|TR0|elderly patients who would come 
20110105142738.731|20110105142740.343|TR0|to them who had Medicare. And 
20110105142740.343|20110105142741.954|TR0|then you had the requirement 
20110105142741.954|20110105142743.565|TR0|that now that this was a federal 
20110105142743.565|20110105142745.177|TR0|program, that hospitals in the 
20110105142745.177|20110105142746.788|TR0|South would have to be 
20110105142746.788|20110105142748.399|TR0|integrated in order to get paid 
20110105142748.399|20110105142750.011|TR0|under Medicare. And so, 50 
20110105142750.011|20110105142751.622|TR0|percent of the hospitals in the 
20110105142751.622|20110105142753.233|TR0|South were announcing they'd 
20110105142753.233|20110105142754.845|TR0|boycott, including George 
20110105142754.845|20110105142756.456|TR0|Wallace, the governor of 
20110105142756.456|20110105142758.067|TR0|Alabama, announcing that he 
20110105142758.067|20110105142759.679|TR0|would lead that boycott and 
20110105142759.679|20110105142801.290|TR0|repeal effort.
20110105142801.290|20110105142802.901|TR0|
20110105142802.901|20110105142804.513|TR0|Johnson did a combination, over 
20110105142804.513|20110105142806.124|TR0|the next few months, of both 
20110105142806.124|20110105142807.735|TR0|confrontation and conciliation. 
20110105142807.735|20110105142809.347|TR0|The confrontation: he sent a 
20110105142809.347|20110105142810.958|TR0|thousand inspectors into the 
20110105142810.958|20110105142812.569|TR0|South and ensured that black 
20110105142812.569|20110105142814.181|TR0|patients could be admitted to 
20110105142814.181|20110105142815.792|TR0|the doors of white hospitals and 
20110105142815.792|20110105142817.403|TR0|even be in the same wards that 
20110105142817.403|20110105142819.015|TR0|white patients were on, which 
20110105142819.015|20110105142820.626|TR0|was considered impossible. He 
20110105142820.626|20110105142822.237|TR0|went so far as make - enforcing 
20110105142822.237|20110105142823.849|TR0|that blood could no longer be 
20110105142823.849|20110105142825.460|TR0|labeled white blood versus black 
20110105142825.460|20110105142827.071|TR0|blood. This was thought to be 
20110105142827.071|20110105142828.683|TR0|the kind of thing that would put 
20110105142828.683|20110105142830.294|TR0|people into the streets. It was 
20110105142830.294|20110105142831.905|TR0|not popular. But he pushed, 
20110105142831.905|20110105142833.517|TR0|because it was the right thing 
20110105142833.517|20110105142835.128|TR0|to do. And by the time the law 
20110105142835.128|20110105142836.739|TR0|actually - one year later, the 
20110105142836.739|20110105142838.351|TR0|cards started landing in 
20110105142838.351|20110105142839.962|TR0|people's mail to get their 
20110105142839.962|20110105142841.573|TR0|Medicare coverage, 90 percent of 
20110105142841.573|20110105142843.185|TR0|the hospitals in the South had 
20110105142843.185|20110105142844.796|TR0|signed up. With the doctors, on 
20110105142844.796|20110105142846.408|TR0|the other hand, he compromised. 
20110105142846.408|20110105142848.019|TR0|About nine months after the bill 
20110105142848.019|20110105142849.630|TR0|passed, there was a series of 
20110105142849.630|20110105142851.242|TR0|improving amendments that 
20110105142851.242|20110105142852.853|TR0|represented some compromises, 
20110105142852.853|20110105142854.464|TR0|that, you know, not everybody 
20110105142854.464|20110105142856.076|TR0|was happy with. Some of them 
20110105142856.076|20110105142857.687|TR0|actually did improve the 
20110105142857.687|20110105142859.298|TR0|program. But they made sure that 
20110105142859.298|20110105142900.910|TR0|passage could go in.
20110105142900.910|20110105142902.521|TR0|
20110105142902.521|20110105142904.132|TR0|And ultimately, we're in that 
20110105142904.132|20110105142905.744|TR0|beginning phase. We are in that 
20110105142905.744|20110105142907.355|TR0|- you know, the battle of trying 
20110105142907.355|20110105142908.966|TR0|to see that nothing happens. But 
20110105142908.966|20110105142910.578|TR0|stalemate is a disaster here for 
20110105142910.578|20110105142912.189|TR0|the healthcare system. We have 
20110105142912.189|20110105142913.800|TR0|to have ways to move forward, 
20110105142913.800|20110105142915.412|TR0|and finding ways through this is 
20110105142915.412|20110105142917.023|TR0|going to be an immense test of 
20110105142917.023|20110105142918.634|TR0|presidential leadership.
20110105142918.634|20110105142920.246|TR0|
20110105142920.246|20110105142921.857|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And the 
20110105142921.857|20110105142923.468|TR0|argument, aside from integrating 
20110105142923.468|20110105142925.080|TR0|the hospitals, like of the Ohio 
20110105142925.080|20110105142926.691|TR0|establishment, why were they 
20110105142926.691|20110105142928.302|TR0|opposed to Medicare? Simply 
20110105142928.302|20110105142929.914|TR0|because government was spending 
20110105142929.914|20110105142931.525|TR0|money on healthcare for older 
20110105142931.525|20110105142933.136|TR0|people?
20110105142933.136|20110105142934.748|TR0|
20110105142934.748|20110105142936.359|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: The 
20110105142936.359|20110105142937.970|TR0|rhetoric is markedly familiar. 
20110105142937.970|20110105142939.582|TR0|It's government takeover. It is 
20110105142939.582|20110105142941.193|TR0|socialism. It is "It's going to 
20110105142941.193|20110105142942.804|TR0|be harming people. Your 
20110105142942.804|20110105142944.416|TR0|grandmother will not get the 
20110105142944.416|20110105142946.027|TR0|treatment that she needs." It's 
20110105142946.027|20110105142947.638|TR0|fascinating, the entire basis of 
20110105142947.638|20110105142949.250|TR0|argument is not strikingly 
20110105142949.250|20110105142950.861|TR0|different. And here, this is a 
20110105142950.861|20110105142952.472|TR0|bill that's not even bringing in 
20110105142952.472|20110105142954.084|TR0|a government insurance program. 
20110105142954.084|20110105142955.695|TR0|This is a bill that's providing 
20110105142955.695|20110105142957.306|TR0|subsidies to private insurers to 
20110105142957.306|20110105142958.918|TR0|make it possible for 32 million 
20110105142958.918|20110105143000.529|TR0|people to receive insurance who 
20110105143000.529|20110105143002.140|TR0|didn't have it, plus start 
20110105143002.140|20110105143003.752|TR0|putting in some billions of 
20110105143003.752|20110105143005.363|TR0|dollars for experiments in 
20110105143005.363|20110105143006.974|TR0|communities across the country

20110105143008.586|20110105143010.197|TR0|while trying to lower the costs 
20110105143010.197|20110105143011.808|TR0|of care. That's the - you know, 
20110105143011.808|20110105143013.420|TR0|the meaning of this kind of 
20110105143013.420|20110105143015.031|TR0|legislation is something that is 
20110105143015.031|20110105143016.642|TR0|under - this is the core source 
20110105143016.642|20110105143018.254|TR0|of debate: people trying to 
20110105143018.254|20110105143019.865|TR0|determine what it means to put 
20110105143019.865|20110105143021.477|TR0|such a complex package together. 
20110105143021.477|20110105143023.088|TR0|Medicare was not exactly simple 
20110105143023.088|20110105143024.699|TR0|as a program, either. And this 
20110105143024.699|20110105143026.311|TR0|is an effort to define it, even, 
20110105143026.311|20110105143027.922|TR0|you know, by repeating the words

20110105143029.533|20110105143031.145|TR0|over again.

20110105143032.756|20110105143034.367|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Well, 
20110105143034.367|20110105143035.979|TR0|I mean, you bring up an 
20110105143035.979|20110105143037.590|TR0|interesting point. There are 
20110105143037.590|20110105143039.201|TR0|critics of the bill from across 
20110105143039.201|20110105143040.813|TR0|the political spectrum. You 
20110105143040.813|20110105143042.424|TR0|know, many thought that this 
20110105143042.424|20110105143044.035|TR0|just expanded an already broken 
20110105143044.035|20110105143045.647|TR0|system, that it forced people to 
20110105143045.647|20110105143047.258|TR0|buy a faulty products - health 
20110105143047.258|20110105143048.869|TR0|insurance - that it didn't 
20110105143048.869|20110105143050.481|TR0|include a public option, which 
20110105143050.481|20110105143052.092|TR0|many said was essential to real 
20110105143052.092|20110105143053.703|TR0|reform. What's in the bill that 
20110105143053.703|20110105143055.315|TR0|you like? Why do you think it's 
20110105143055.315|20110105143056.926|TR0|a good piece of legislation?
20110105143056.926|20110105143058.537|TR0|
20110105143058.537|20110105143100.149|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: You're 
20110105143100.149|20110105143101.760|TR0|absolutely right. There are 
20110105143101.760|20110105143103.371|TR0|concerns from both the left and 
20110105143103.371|20110105143104.983|TR0|the right. And what is essential 
20110105143104.983|20110105143106.594|TR0|is that we are an experimenting 
20110105143106.594|20110105143108.205|TR0|and innovating society, that we 
20110105143108.205|20110105143109.817|TR0|are trying new things when we 
20110105143109.817|20110105143111.428|TR0|face problems and breakdown. We 
20110105143111.428|20110105143113.039|TR0|reached - we were able to reach 
20110105143113.039|20110105143114.651|TR0|an agreement that could get 
20110105143114.651|20110105143116.262|TR0|through Congress, when people 
20110105143116.262|20110105143117.873|TR0|have tried for half a century to 
20110105143117.873|20110105143119.485|TR0|get passage of coverage for the 
20110105143119.485|20110105143121.096|TR0|uninsured and for improving the 
20110105143121.096|20110105143122.707|TR0|delivery system for care. And we 
20110105143122.707|20110105143124.319|TR0|have finally accomplished it. It 
20110105143124.319|20110105143125.930|TR0|will represent now our next 
20110105143125.930|20110105143127.541|TR0|decade of work, seeing how well 
20110105143127.541|20110105143129.153|TR0|it works, seeing where the 
20110105143129.153|20110105143130.764|TR0|problems are. And if, for 
20110105143130.764|20110105143132.375|TR0|example, private insurers simply 
20110105143132.375|20110105143133.987|TR0|prove to worsen care, to only 
20110105143133.987|20110105143135.598|TR0|add on layers of cost, this is a 
20110105143135.598|20110105143137.209|TR0|test that the insurers have to 
20110105143137.209|20110105143138.821|TR0|end up measuring up to or 
20110105143138.821|20110105143140.432|TR0|failing. And if they fail, then 
20110105143140.432|20110105143142.043|TR0|it's every reason that the left 
20110105143142.043|20110105143143.655|TR0|will be correct, that government 
20110105143143.655|20110105143145.266|TR0|insurance programs are in fact 
20110105143145.266|20110105143146.877|TR0|better than private insurance 
20110105143146.877|20110105143148.489|TR0|programs. This is the test and 
20110105143148.489|20110105143150.100|TR0|the question that we can 
20110105143150.100|20110105143151.711|TR0|actually try out. Or, we just go 
20110105143151.711|20110105143153.323|TR0|into stalemate.

20110105143156.546|20110105143158.157|TR0|provisions of the healthcare law 
20110105143158.157|20110105143159.768|TR0|targeted by Republicans bars 
20110105143159.768|20110105143201.380|TR0|insurance companies from denying 
20110105143201.380|20110105143202.991|TR0|coverage based on pre-existing 
20110105143202.991|20110105143204.602|TR0|conditions. Former Arkansas 
20110105143204.602|20110105143206.214|TR0|governor Mike Huckabee, who's 
20110105143206.214|20110105143207.825|TR0|considered one of the top

20110105143217.493|20110105143219.104|TR0|>> MIKE HUCKABEE: And then a lot 
20110105143219.104|20110105143220.716|TR0|of this, it sounds so good, and 
20110105143220.716|20110105143222.327|TR0|it's such a warm message to say, 
20110105143222.327|20110105143223.938|TR0|"And we're not going to deny 
20110105143223.938|20110105143225.550|TR0|anyone from a pre-existing 
20110105143225.550|20110105143227.161|TR0|condition." Look, I think that 
20110105143227.161|20110105143228.772|TR0|sounds terrific. But I want to 
20110105143228.772|20110105143230.384|TR0|ask you something from a 
20110105143230.384|20110105143231.995|TR0|commonsense perspective. Suppose 
20110105143231.995|20110105143233.606|TR0|we apply that principle, that 
20110105143233.606|20110105143235.218|TR0|you can just come on with 
20110105143235.218|20110105143236.829|TR0|whatever condition you have and 
20110105143236.829|20110105143238.440|TR0|we're going to cover you at the 
20110105143238.440|20110105143240.052|TR0|same cost we're covering 
20110105143240.052|20110105143241.663|TR0|everybody else, because we want 
20110105143241.663|20110105143243.274|TR0|to be fair. OK, fine. Then let's 
20110105143243.274|20110105143244.886|TR0|do that with our property 
20110105143244.886|20110105143246.497|TR0|insurance. And you can call your 
20110105143246.497|20110105143248.108|TR0|insurance agent and say, "I'd to 
20110105143248.108|20110105143249.720|TR0|buy some insurance for my 
20110105143249.720|20110105143251.331|TR0|house." He'd say, "Tell me about 
20110105143251.331|20110105143252.942|TR0|your house." "Well, sir, it 
20110105143252.942|20110105143254.554|TR0|burned down yesterday, but I'd 
20110105143254.554|20110105143256.165|TR0|like to insure it today." And 
20110105143256.165|20110105143257.776|TR0|he'll say, "I'm sorry, but we 
20110105143257.776|20110105143259.388|TR0|can't insure it after it's 
20110105143259.388|20110105143300.999|TR0|already burned." Well, no 
20110105143300.999|20110105143302.610|TR0|pre-existing conditions. How 
20110105143302.610|20110105143304.222|TR0|would you like to be able to 
20110105143304.222|20110105143305.833|TR0|call your insurance agent for 
20110105143305.833|20110105143307.444|TR0|your car and say, "I want to 
20110105143307.444|20110105143309.056|TR0|insure my car"? "Well, tell me 
20110105143309.056|20110105143310.667|TR0|about your car." "Well, it was a 
20110105143310.667|20110105143312.278|TR0|pretty nice vehicle, 'til my 
20110105143312.278|20110105143313.890|TR0|16-year-old boy wrecked it 
20110105143313.890|20110105143315.501|TR0|yesterday. Totaled the thing up, 
20110105143315.501|20110105143317.112|TR0|but I'd like to get it insured 
20110105143317.112|20110105143318.724|TR0|so we could get it replaced." 
20110105143318.724|20110105143320.335|TR0|Now, how much would a policy

20110105143321.946|20110105143323.558|TR0|About as much as it's going to

20110105143341.283|20110105143342.894|TR0|what's fascinating is that the 
20110105143342.894|20110105143344.505|TR0|argument here is exactly the 
20110105143344.505|20110105143346.117|TR0|case for what - for the 
20110105143346.117|20110105143347.728|TR0|individual mandate. That is, if 
20110105143347.728|20110105143349.339|TR0|you're going to have a private 
20110105143349.339|20110105143350.951|TR0|insurance system. The

20110105143402.230|20110105143403.841|TR0|that everybody would obtain 
20110105143403.841|20110105143405.453|TR0|private insurance coverage, and 
20110105143405.453|20110105143407.064|TR0|if they couldn't afford it, have 
20110105143407.064|20110105143408.675|TR0|subsidies for that insurance. If 
20110105143408.675|20110105143410.287|TR0|you - yes, of course, if we had

20110105143423.177|20110105143424.789|TR0|matter of arguing about the key 
20110105143424.789|20110105143426.400|TR0|detail points back and forth. 
20110105143426.400|20110105143428.011|TR0|But the core issue here is that, 
20110105143428.011|20110105143429.623|TR0|on the one hand, attack the 
20110105143429.623|20110105143431.234|TR0|provision that pre-existing 
20110105143431.234|20110105143432.845|TR0|conditions are - there's a 
20110105143432.845|20110105143434.457|TR0|regulation, you'll call it 
20110105143434.457|20110105143436.068|TR0|"bureaucracy," and it's 
20110105143436.068|20110105143437.679|TR0|regulation to ban pre-existing 
20110105143437.679|20110105143439.291|TR0|conditions, and then attack the 
20110105143439.291|20110105143440.902|TR0|bill for not - for mandating 
20110105143440.902|20110105143442.513|TR0|that insurance be required, but 
20110105143442.513|20110105143444.125|TR0|then also attack the idea that 
20110105143444.125|20110105143445.736|TR0|you're going to - because the 
20110105143445.736|20110105143447.347|TR0|only alternative to that would 
20110105143447.347|20110105143448.959|TR0|then be single payer. If you do 
20110105143448.959|20110105143450.570|TR0|not have the basic provisions in 
20110105143450.570|20110105143452.181|TR0|place for insurance regulation, 
20110105143452.181|20110105143453.793|TR0|then the only other option for 
20110105143453.793|20110105143455.404|TR0|insuring the public would be 
20110105143455.404|20110105143457.015|TR0|government insurance.

20110105143458.627|20110105143500.238|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What's amazing 
20110105143500.238|20110105143501.849|TR0|from all the studies that have 
20110105143501.849|20110105143503.461|TR0|been done, everything from 
20110105143503.461|20110105143505.072|TR0|Social Security to Medicare, I 
20110105143505.072|20110105143506.684|TR0|mean, it shows that the 
20110105143506.684|20110105143508.295|TR0|population is so different than 
20110105143508.295|20110105143509.906|TR0|the very small circle of 
20110105143509.906|20110105143511.518|TR0|know-nothing pundits we get on 
20110105143511.518|20110105143513.129|TR0|television. It is remarkable 
20110105143513.129|20110105143514.740|TR0|even on the issue of single 
20110105143514.740|20110105143516.352|TR0|payer. The polls show, when 
20110105143516.352|20110105143517.963|TR0|explained, when not talked about 
20110105143517.963|20110105143519.574|TR0|as - you know, Fox put out that 
20110105143519.574|20110105143521.186|TR0|memo that you're not supposed to 
20110105143521.186|20110105143522.797|TR0|refer to it as a "public" 
20110105143522.797|20110105143524.408|TR0|option, but a "government" 
20110105143524.408|20110105143526.020|TR0|option - when people actually 
20110105143526.020|20110105143527.631|TR0|explain what it is, most people 
20110105143527.631|20110105143529.242|TR0|are for it.
20110105143529.242|20110105143530.854|TR0|
20110105143530.854|20110105143532.465|TR0|But I wanted to go back to this 
20110105143532.465|20110105143534.076|TR0|critical discussion about end of 
20110105143534.076|20110105143535.688|TR0|life, because it's something we 
20110105143535.688|20110105143537.299|TR0|don't deal with until we are in 
20110105143537.299|20110105143538.910|TR0|crisis. And that's when people 
20110105143538.910|20110105143540.522|TR0|are struggling to get 
20110105143540.522|20110105143542.133|TR0|information, and they have the 
20110105143542.133|20110105143543.744|TR0|least ability to get the 
20110105143543.744|20110105143545.356|TR0|information, and that's when 
20110105143545.356|20110105143546.967|TR0|they have to deal with these 
20110105143546.967|20110105143548.578|TR0|issues. The piece that you wrote 
20110105143548.578|20110105143550.190|TR0|in The New Yorker goes through 
20110105143550.190|20110105143551.801|TR0|many different cases. But you 
20110105143551.801|20110105143553.412|TR0|talk about two studies, one that 
20110105143553.412|20110105143555.024|TR0|was run by Aetna and another, 
20110105143555.024|20110105143556.635|TR0|the whole community in La 
20110105143556.635|20110105143558.246|TR0|Crosse, Wisconsin. Why don't we 
20110105143558.246|20110105143559.858|TR0|go to La Crosse, Wisconsin, and 
20110105143559.858|20110105143601.469|TR0|talk about what happened there?
20110105143601.469|20110105143603.080|TR0|
20110105143603.080|20110105143604.692|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: La Crosse, 
20110105143604.692|20110105143606.303|TR0|Wisconsin is a typical 
20110105143606.303|20110105143607.914|TR0|Midwestern community where the 
20110105143607.914|20110105143609.526|TR0|local doctors and a bioethicist 
20110105143609.526|20110105143611.137|TR0|there decided that they wanted 
20110105143611.137|20110105143612.748|TR0|to improve the care for people 
20110105143612.748|20110105143614.360|TR0|with terminal illness. And they 
20110105143614.360|20110105143615.971|TR0|did it by working to make sure 
20110105143615.971|20110105143617.582|TR0|that everybody in the town had a 
20110105143617.582|20110105143619.194|TR0|living will - and not by forcing 
20110105143619.194|20110105143620.805|TR0|anybody to have a living will, 
20110105143620.805|20110105143622.416|TR0|but simply by teaching 
20110105143622.416|20110105143624.028|TR0|everybody, from chaplains to 
20110105143624.028|20110105143625.639|TR0|social workers to doctors, how 
20110105143625.639|20110105143627.250|TR0|to have good conversations and 
20110105143627.250|20110105143628.862|TR0|to take the time to have good 
20110105143628.862|20110105143630.473|TR0|conversations with people about 
20110105143630.473|20110105143632.084|TR0|the kind of choices that they 
20110105143632.084|20110105143633.696|TR0|will face when, as all of us 
20110105143633.696|20110105143635.307|TR0|will, when they become sick.

20110105143636.918|20110105143638.530|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And a "living 
20110105143638.530|20110105143640.141|TR0|will" means what?

20110105143641.753|20110105143643.364|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: And a 
20110105143643.364|20110105143644.975|TR0|living will means being able to 
20110105143644.975|20110105143646.587|TR0|say in advance what you desire 
20110105143646.587|20110105143648.198|TR0|when it comes time for 
20110105143648.198|20110105143649.809|TR0|treatment, everything from would 
20110105143649.809|20110105143651.421|TR0|I want to have my - would I want 
20110105143651.421|20110105143653.032|TR0|- if my heart stops, would I 
20110105143653.032|20110105143654.643|TR0|want to be resuscitated, and if 
20110105143654.643|20110105143656.255|TR0|I had a pneumonia, would I want 
20110105143656.255|20110105143657.866|TR0|to treat it. For most of us, in 
20110105143657.866|20110105143659.477|TR0|our phases of life, the obvious 
20110105143659.477|20110105143701.089|TR0|answer is "Yes, please." But we 
20110105143701.089|20110105143702.700|TR0|will all reach a phase where we 
20110105143702.700|20110105143704.311|TR0|will reach a point where the 
20110105143704.311|20110105143705.923|TR0|suffering of treatment for the 
20110105143705.923|20110105143707.534|TR0|sake of prolonging life will 
20110105143707.534|20110105143709.145|TR0|have trade-offs that we begin to 
20110105143709.145|20110105143710.757|TR0|struggle with, especially as we 
20110105143710.757|20110105143712.368|TR0|become ill and disabled by 
20110105143712.368|20110105143713.979|TR0|chronic illness.
20110105143713.979|20110105143715.591|TR0|
20110105143715.591|20110105143717.202|TR0|So, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, 
20110105143717.202|20110105143718.813|TR0|they had a community effort. And 
20110105143718.813|20110105143720.425|TR0|the result was, over 90 percent 
20110105143720.425|20110105143722.036|TR0|of the population ended up 
20110105143722.036|20110105143723.647|TR0|having what they call advanced 
20110105143723.647|20110105143725.259|TR0|directives, a living will. The 
20110105143725.259|20110105143726.870|TR0|doctors actually paid attention 
20110105143726.870|20110105143728.481|TR0|to what they had written down, 
20110105143728.481|20110105143730.093|TR0|which often gets ignored. And it 
20110105143730.093|20110105143731.704|TR0|was not a matter of follow what 
20110105143731.704|20110105143733.315|TR0|this piece of paper says. The 
20110105143733.315|20110105143734.927|TR0|power of it proved to be that 
20110105143734.927|20110105143736.538|TR0|for people with terminal 
20110105143736.538|20110105143738.149|TR0|illness, they had thought about 
20110105143738.149|20110105143739.761|TR0|what might happen as they got 
20110105143739.761|20110105143741.372|TR0|sicker, whether they wanted to 
20110105143741.372|20110105143742.983|TR0|be at home or in a hospital when 
20110105143742.983|20110105143744.595|TR0|the end came, how much control 
20110105143744.595|20110105143746.206|TR0|they wanted over their life.
20110105143746.206|20110105143747.817|TR0|
20110105143747.817|20110105143749.429|TR0|And by being able to articulate 
20110105143749.429|20110105143751.040|TR0|their values and concerns about 
20110105143751.040|20110105143752.651|TR0|facing that kind of illness, two 
20110105143752.651|20110105143754.263|TR0|things happened in La Crosse. 
20110105143754.263|20110105143755.874|TR0|First of all, the number of 
20110105143755.874|20110105143757.485|TR0|people who died in intensive 
20110105143757.485|20110105143759.097|TR0|care units and being kept alive 
20110105143759.097|20110105143800.708|TR0|on ventilators and on machines, 
20110105143800.708|20110105143802.319|TR0|past the point of being even 
20110105143802.319|20110105143803.931|TR0|conscious of what's going on, 
20110105143803.931|20110105143805.542|TR0|declined markedly. The costs of 
20110105143805.542|20110105143807.153|TR0|people in the last year of life 
20110105143807.153|20110105143808.765|TR0|went down markedly. There was no 
20110105143808.765|20110105143810.376|TR0|change in how long people lived 
20110105143810.376|20110105143811.987|TR0|in La Crosse, Wisconsin. And it 
20110105143811.987|20110105143813.599|TR0|really became a model community 
20110105143813.599|20110105143815.210|TR0|for the entire country. They 
20110105143815.210|20110105143816.822|TR0|were the ones. They said the one 
20110105143816.822|20110105143818.433|TR0|barrier we have left in La 
20110105143818.433|20110105143820.044|TR0|Crosse is that the doctors don't 
20110105143820.044|20110105143821.656|TR0|have the time to talk to 
20110105143821.656|20110105143823.267|TR0|patients, because they're only 
20110105143823.267|20110105143824.878|TR0|paid for a short visit. Having 
20110105143824.878|20110105143826.490|TR0|the time to talk at length to 
20110105143826.490|20110105143828.101|TR0|people who are really, really 
20110105143828.101|20110105143829.712|TR0|sick, facing a few months to 
20110105143829.712|20110105143831.324|TR0|live, they needed to be 
20110105143831.324|20110105143832.935|TR0|compensated for that. And that 
20110105143832.935|20110105143834.546|TR0|led - they were the starters of

20110105143836.158|20110105143837.769|TR0|help people decide, do they want 
20110105143837.769|20110105143839.380|TR0|hospice care versus hospital 
20110105143839.380|20110105143840.992|TR0|care, and having the dollars in

20110105143842.603|20110105143844.214|TR0|conversations less of a burden

20110105143918.052|20110105143919.664|TR0|surgeon at Brigham and Women's 
20110105143919.664|20110105143921.275|TR0|Hospital in Boston, staff writer 
20110105143921.275|20110105143922.886|TR0|at The New Yorker magazine, also 
20110105143922.886|20110105143924.498|TR0|has written the book The

20110105143929.332|20110105143930.943|TR0|The whole discussion of how 
20110105143930.943|20110105143932.554|TR0|people deal, when they're 
20110105143932.554|20110105143934.166|TR0|dealing with terminal illness, 
20110105143934.166|20110105143935.777|TR0|and having control of their 
20110105143935.777|20110105143937.388|TR0|lives, having a humane ending is 
20110105143937.388|20110105143939.000|TR0|something doctors have not been 
20110105143939.000|20110105143940.611|TR0|trained to deal with, and 
20110105143940.611|20110105143942.222|TR0|certainly people just in general 
20110105143942.222|20110105143943.834|TR0|have had trouble with and do not 
20110105143943.834|20110105143945.445|TR0|have the experience, until it's 
20110105143945.445|20110105143947.056|TR0|too late. There was an Aetna 
20110105143947.056|20110105143948.668|TR0|study that was done that was 
20110105143948.668|20110105143950.279|TR0|fascinating, Dr. Gawande.
20110105143950.279|20110105143951.891|TR0|
20110105143951.891|20110105143953.502|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Yeah, this 
20110105143953.502|20110105143955.113|TR0|was a powerful study - of all 
20110105143955.113|20110105143956.725|TR0|things, an example of an 
20110105143956.725|20110105143958.336|TR0|insurance company doing an 
20110105143958.336|20110105143959.947|TR0|innovative program, where the 
20110105143959.947|20110105144001.559|TR0|usual rule to get hospice care - 
20110105144001.559|20110105144003.170|TR0|and hospice care, usual rule to 
20110105144003.170|20110105144004.781|TR0|get hospice care is that you 
20110105144004.781|20110105144006.393|TR0|have to be in the last six 
20110105144006.393|20110105144008.004|TR0|months of your life, certified 
20110105144008.004|20110105144009.615|TR0|by a doctor, and give up all 
20110105144009.615|20110105144011.227|TR0|other treatments, in order to be 
20110105144011.227|20110105144012.838|TR0|- to see a hospice nurse, who 
20110105144012.838|20110105144014.449|TR0|comes to your home and helps 
20110105144014.449|20110105144016.061|TR0|make sure that, on a daily 
20110105144016.061|20110105144017.672|TR0|basis, you're not in pain, 
20110105144017.672|20110105144019.283|TR0|you're not in suffering, and 
20110105144019.283|20110105144020.895|TR0|helping your family cope with a 
20110105144020.895|20110105144022.506|TR0|dying patient.
20110105144022.506|20110105144024.117|TR0|
20110105144024.117|20110105144025.729|TR0|Aetna did an experiment where 
20110105144025.729|20110105144027.340|TR0|they said, "You know what? You 
20110105144027.340|20110105144028.951|TR0|don't have to give up the 
20110105144028.951|20110105144030.563|TR0|chemotherapy. You don't have to 
20110105144030.563|20110105144032.174|TR0|give up the radiation. And we'll 
20110105144032.174|20110105144033.785|TR0|still have the hospice nurse 
20110105144033.785|20110105144035.397|TR0|visit." And what they found is 
20110105144035.397|20110105144037.008|TR0|that those patients who had care 
20110105144037.008|20110105144038.619|TR0|at home to help them in their 
20110105144038.619|20110105144040.231|TR0|last months ended up being less 
20110105144040.231|20110105144041.842|TR0|likely to end up in the 
20110105144041.842|20110105144043.453|TR0|hospital. They chose less 
20110105144043.453|20110105144045.065|TR0|treatment for - through 
20110105144045.065|20110105144046.676|TR0|chemotherapy and radiation. And 
20110105144046.676|20110105144048.287|TR0|they didn't live shorter. They, 
20110105144048.287|20110105144049.899|TR0|in fact - in further studies 
20110105144049.899|20110105144051.510|TR0|that have been done, when people 
20110105144051.510|20110105144053.121|TR0|have received palliative care, 
20110105144053.121|20110105144054.733|TR0|which occurs even before those 
20110105144054.733|20110105144056.344|TR0|dying few months, but just 
20110105144056.344|20110105144057.955|TR0|trying to get attention to the 
20110105144057.955|20110105144059.567|TR0|symptoms that occur with a 
20110105144059.567|20110105144101.178|TR0|terminal illness, receiving 
20110105144101.178|20110105144102.789|TR0|palliative care lengthened 
20110105144102.789|20110105144104.401|TR0|people's lives at the time that 
20110105144104.401|20110105144106.012|TR0|they were choosing to reduce 
20110105144106.012|20110105144107.623|TR0|their use of hospitals and 
20110105144107.623|20110105144109.235|TR0|aggressive therapies. And so, 
20110105144109.235|20110105144110.846|TR0|these kinds of programs are very 
20110105144110.846|20110105144112.457|TR0|powerful and have become 
20110105144112.457|20110105144114.069|TR0|unequivocal examples of needing 
20110105144114.069|20110105144115.680|TR0|to move forward in changing the 
20110105144115.680|20110105144117.291|TR0|way we deliver care for these 
20110105144117.291|20110105144118.903|TR0|kinds of patients.

20110105144120.514|20110105144122.125|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, this is 
20110105144122.125|20110105144123.737|TR0|amazing, that patients at the 
20110105144123.737|20110105144125.348|TR0|end of life, in terminal cancer, 
20110105144125.348|20110105144126.960|TR0|actually, when they went through 
20110105144126.960|20110105144128.571|TR0|hospice or they decided not to 
20110105144128.571|20110105144130.182|TR0|prolong their lives through 
20110105144130.182|20110105144131.794|TR0|artificial means, lived longer 
20110105144131.794|20110105144133.405|TR0|than they would have if they had 
20110105144133.405|20110105144135.016|TR0|gone through the treatments.

20110105144136.628|20110105144138.239|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: A Medicare 
20110105144138.239|20110105144139.850|TR0|study of the hospice benefit 
20110105144139.850|20110105144141.462|TR0|found that the patients who took 
20110105144141.462|20110105144143.073|TR0|the hospice option - and these 
20110105144143.073|20110105144144.684|TR0|were people who were forced to 
20110105144144.684|20110105144146.296|TR0|give up the aggressive 
20110105144146.296|20110105144147.907|TR0|treatments and so on - that 
20110105144147.907|20110105144149.518|TR0|those hospice patients lived 
20110105144149.518|20110105144151.130|TR0|longer. And the examples were in 
20110105144151.130|20110105144152.741|TR0|colon cancer, breast cancer. 
20110105144152.741|20110105144154.352|TR0|Congestive heart failure 
20110105144154.352|20110105144155.964|TR0|patients lived on average three 
20110105144155.964|20110105144157.575|TR0|months longer than the group who 
20110105144157.575|20110105144159.186|TR0|continued the aggressive therapy 
20110105144159.186|20110105144200.798|TR0|right to the very last day of 
20110105144200.798|20110105144202.409|TR0|their life.

20110105144204.020|20110105144205.632|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: I want 
20110105144205.632|20110105144207.243|TR0|to switch gears for a moment. 
20110105144207.243|20110105144208.854|TR0|You wrote a remarkable piece 
20110105144208.854|20110105144210.466|TR0|about the effects of solitary 
20110105144210.466|20110105144212.077|TR0|confinement on prisoners, on 
20110105144212.077|20110105144213.688|TR0|people who have been held in 
20110105144213.688|20110105144215.300|TR0|isolation for a long time. On 
20110105144215.300|20110105144216.911|TR0|this issue, I just want to turn 
20110105144216.911|20110105144218.522|TR0|to the case of the four 
20110105144218.522|20110105144220.134|TR0|prisoners in a supermax prison, 
20110105144220.134|20110105144221.745|TR0|the Ohio State Penitentiary. 
20110105144221.745|20110105144223.356|TR0|This week they launched a hunger 
20110105144223.356|20110105144224.968|TR0|strike to protest what they call 
20110105144224.968|20110105144226.579|TR0|their harsh mistreatment under 
20110105144226.579|20110105144228.190|TR0|solitary confinement. The 
20110105144228.190|20110105144229.802|TR0|prisoners - Bomani Shakur, 
20110105144229.802|20110105144231.413|TR0|Siddique Abdullah Hasan, Jason 
20110105144231.413|20110105144233.024|TR0|Robb and Namir Abdul Mateen - 
20110105144233.024|20110105144234.636|TR0|were sentenced to death for 
20110105144234.636|20110105144236.247|TR0|their involvement in the 1993 
20110105144236.247|20110105144237.858|TR0|prison uprising in Lucasville, 
20110105144237.858|20110105144239.470|TR0|Ohio. For over 17 years, they've 
20110105144239.470|20110105144241.081|TR0|been held in 23-hours-a-day 
20110105144241.081|20110105144242.692|TR0|solitary lockdown. On Monday, 
20110105144242.692|20110105144244.304|TR0|the four began refusing to eat 
20110105144244.304|20110105144245.915|TR0|meals until they are moved out 
20110105144245.915|20110105144247.526|TR0|of solitary confinement and onto 
20110105144247.526|20110105144249.138|TR0|death row, where they say 
20110105144249.138|20110105144250.749|TR0|they'll get better treatment. 
20110105144250.749|20110105144252.360|TR0|Yesterday I spoke - Amy spoke 
20110105144252.360|20110105144253.972|TR0|with the longtime peace 
20110105144253.972|20110105144255.583|TR0|activist, historian and lawyer, 
20110105144255.583|20110105144257.194|TR0|Staughton Lynd. He wrote the 
20110105144257.194|20110105144258.806|TR0|definitive history of the 1993 
20110105144258.806|20110105144300.417|TR0|Ohio prison uprising at 
20110105144300.417|20110105144302.029|TR0|Lucasville. He described the 
20110105144302.029|20110105144303.640|TR0|prisoners' conditions. Let's 
20110105144303.640|20110105144305.251|TR0|take a listen.
20110105144305.251|20110105144306.863|TR0|
20110105144306.863|20110105144308.474|TR0|>> STAUGHTON LYND: They are held 
20110105144308.474|20110105144310.085|TR0|in more restrictive confinement 
20110105144310.085|20110105144311.697|TR0|than the more than 100 other 
20110105144311.697|20110105144313.308|TR0|death sentence prisoners in the 
20110105144313.308|20110105144314.919|TR0|same prison. Now, why is this? 
20110105144314.919|20110105144316.531|TR0|It's precisely because the 
20110105144316.531|20110105144318.142|TR0|system thinks of them as 
20110105144318.142|20110105144319.753|TR0|leaders. So, it will let them 
20110105144319.753|20110105144321.365|TR0|watch television. They even let 
20110105144321.365|20110105144322.976|TR0|Bomani Shakur use a typewriter. 
20110105144322.976|20110105144324.587|TR0|But what they don't let any of 
20110105144324.587|20110105144326.199|TR0|the four men do is to be in the 
20110105144326.199|20110105144327.810|TR0|same space as another human 
20110105144327.810|20110105144329.421|TR0|being other than a guard at the 
20110105144329.421|20110105144331.033|TR0|same time. And this means that 
20110105144331.033|20110105144332.644|TR0|while other death sentence 
20110105144332.644|20110105144334.255|TR0|prisoners can wander about the 
20110105144334.255|20110105144335.867|TR0|pod, can have collective meals 
20110105144335.867|20110105144337.478|TR0|outside their cells, and 
20110105144337.478|20110105144339.089|TR0|especially can have semi-contact 
20110105144339.089|20110105144340.701|TR0|visits with their friends and 
20110105144340.701|20110105144342.312|TR0|families, the four are always 
20110105144342.312|20110105144343.923|TR0|obliged to encounter the world 
20110105144343.923|20110105144345.535|TR0|either through a solid cell door 
20110105144345.535|20110105144347.146|TR0|or, when they go out on a visit, 
20110105144347.146|20110105144348.757|TR0|through a solid pane of glass. 
20110105144348.757|20110105144350.369|TR0|So that, again, Bomani has a 
20110105144350.369|20110105144351.980|TR0|niece and nephew aged eight and 
20110105144351.980|20110105144353.591|TR0|three that he loves and would 
20110105144353.591|20110105144355.203|TR0|wish to touch. If he were on 
20110105144355.203|20110105144356.814|TR0|death row, he could do that. But 
20110105144356.814|20110105144358.425|TR0|he's been told by the prison 
20110105144358.425|20110105144400.037|TR0|authorities he will never be on 
20110105144400.037|20110105144401.648|TR0|death row, because they're going 
20110105144401.648|20110105144403.259|TR0|to keep him in social isolation 
20110105144403.259|20110105144404.871|TR0|until they kill him.
20110105144404.871|20110105144406.482|TR0|
20110105144406.482|20110105144408.093|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, that is 
20110105144408.093|20110105144409.705|TR0|Staughton Lynd, the longtime 
20110105144409.705|20110105144411.316|TR0|peace activist, lawyer, talking 
20110105144411.316|20110105144412.927|TR0|about these four men who have 
20110105144412.927|20110105144414.539|TR0|now gone on a hunger strike at 
20110105144414.539|20110105144416.150|TR0|the Ohio State Penitentiary, 
20110105144416.150|20110105144417.761|TR0|demanding to be put on death 
20110105144417.761|20110105144419.373|TR0|row, where they say that they 
20110105144419.373|20110105144420.984|TR0|will be treated better.
20110105144420.984|20110105144422.595|TR0|
20110105144422.595|20110105144424.207|TR0|And then we've got the case of 
20110105144424.207|20110105144425.818|TR0|the alleged WikiLeaks Army 
20110105144425.818|20110105144427.429|TR0|whistleblower Bradley Manning, 
20110105144427.429|20110105144429.041|TR0|who's being held in solitary 
20110105144429.041|20110105144430.652|TR0|confinement. Twenty-two years 
20110105144430.652|20110105144432.263|TR0|old, U.S. Army private, arrested 
20110105144432.263|20110105144433.875|TR0|in May, has been in detention 
20110105144433.875|20110105144435.486|TR0|ever since. For the past five 
20110105144435.486|20110105144437.098|TR0|months, he's been held at the 
20110105144437.098|20110105144438.709|TR0|U.S. Marine brig at Quantico, 
20110105144438.709|20110105144440.320|TR0|Virginia, before that, held for 
20110105144440.320|20110105144441.932|TR0|two months in a military jail in 
20110105144441.932|20110105144443.543|TR0|Kuwait. Last month, we spoke to 
20110105144443.543|20110105144445.154|TR0|Glenn Greenwald, the political 
20110105144445.154|20110105144446.766|TR0|and legal blogger at Salon.com. 
20110105144446.766|20110105144448.377|TR0|Glenn reported that Manning is 
20110105144448.377|20110105144449.988|TR0|being held under conditions that 
20110105144449.988|20110105144451.600|TR0|constitute cruel and inhumane 
20110105144451.600|20110105144453.211|TR0|treatment, and even torture. 
20110105144453.211|20110105144454.822|TR0|This is what Glenn Greenwald 
20110105144454.822|20110105144456.434|TR0|said.
20110105144456.434|20110105144458.045|TR0|
20110105144458.045|20110105144459.656|TR0|>> GLENN GREENWALD: He's been 
20110105144459.656|20110105144501.268|TR0|held for seven months without 
20110105144501.268|20110105144502.879|TR0|being convicted of any crime. 
20110105144502.879|20110105144504.490|TR0|And the conditions that I 
20110105144504.490|20110105144506.102|TR0|recently discovered he's being 
20110105144506.102|20110105144507.713|TR0|held in are really quite 
20110105144507.713|20110105144509.324|TR0|disturbing. And this has been 
20110105144509.324|20110105144510.936|TR0|true for the entire seven-month 
20110105144510.936|20110105144512.547|TR0|duration of his detention. He is 
20110105144512.547|20110105144514.158|TR0|in solitary confinement, and 
20110105144514.158|20110105144515.770|TR0|he's not only in solitary 
20110105144515.770|20110105144517.381|TR0|confinement, which means that 
20110105144517.381|20110105144518.992|TR0|he's in a cell alone, but he's 
20110105144518.992|20110105144520.604|TR0|there for 23 out of 24 hours 
20110105144520.604|20110105144522.215|TR0|every day. He is released for 
20110105144522.215|20110105144523.826|TR0|one hour a day only. So, 23 out 
20110105144523.826|20110105144525.438|TR0|of the 24 hours a day he sits 
20110105144525.438|20110105144527.049|TR0|alone. He is barred from even 
20110105144527.049|20110105144528.660|TR0|doing things like exercising 
20110105144528.660|20110105144530.272|TR0|inside of his cell. He's 
20110105144530.272|20110105144531.883|TR0|constantly supervised and 
20110105144531.883|20110105144533.494|TR0|monitored, and if he does that, 
20110105144533.494|20110105144535.106|TR0|he's told immediately to stop. 
20110105144535.106|20110105144536.717|TR0|There are very strict rules 
20110105144536.717|20110105144538.328|TR0|about what he's even allowed to 
20110105144538.328|20110105144539.940|TR0|do inside the cell. Beyond that, 
20110105144539.940|20110105144541.551|TR0|he's being denied just the most 
20110105144541.551|20110105144543.162|TR0|basic attributes of civilized 
20110105144543.162|20110105144544.774|TR0|imprisonment, such as a pillow 
20110105144544.774|20110105144546.385|TR0|and sheets, and has been denied 
20110105144546.385|20110105144547.996|TR0|that without explanation for the 
20110105144547.996|20110105144549.608|TR0|entire duration of his visit, as 
20110105144549.608|20110105144551.219|TR0|well. And there is a lot of 
20110105144551.219|20110105144552.830|TR0|literature and a lot of 
20110105144552.830|20110105144554.442|TR0|psychological studies, and even 
20110105144554.442|20110105144556.053|TR0|studies done by the U.S. 
20110105144556.053|20110105144557.664|TR0|military, that show that 
20110105144557.664|20110105144559.276|TR0|prolonged solitary confinement, 
20110105144559.276|20110105144600.887|TR0|which is something that the 
20110105144600.887|20110105144602.498|TR0|United States does almost more 
20110105144602.498|20110105144604.110|TR0|than any other country in the 
20110105144604.110|20110105144605.721|TR0|Western world, of the type to 
20110105144605.721|20110105144607.332|TR0|which Manning is subjected, can 
20110105144607.332|20110105144608.944|TR0|have a very long-term 
20110105144608.944|20110105144610.555|TR0|psychological damage, including 
20110105144610.555|20110105144612.167|TR0|driving people to insanity and 
20110105144612.167|20110105144613.778|TR0|the like. It clearly is cruel 
20110105144613.778|20110105144615.389|TR0|and unusual; it's arguably a 
20110105144615.389|20110105144617.001|TR0|form of torture. And given that 
20110105144617.001|20110105144618.612|TR0|Manning has never been convicted 
20110105144618.612|20110105144620.223|TR0|of anything, unlike the convicts 
20110105144620.223|20110105144621.835|TR0|at supermaxes to whom this 
20110105144621.835|20110105144623.446|TR0|treatment is normally applied, 
20110105144623.446|20110105144625.057|TR0|it's particularly egregious.
20110105144625.057|20110105144626.669|TR0|
20110105144626.669|20110105144628.280|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: That's 
20110105144628.280|20110105144629.891|TR0|Glenn Greenwald, the political 
20110105144629.891|20110105144631.503|TR0|and legal blogger at Salon.com. 
20110105144631.503|20110105144633.114|TR0|In his piece that he wrote about 
20110105144633.114|20110105144634.725|TR0|Manning, he actually cited your 
20110105144634.725|20110105144636.337|TR0|article "Hellhole," which you 
20110105144636.337|20110105144637.948|TR0|document what happens to people 
20110105144637.948|20110105144639.559|TR0|held in isolation. Explain why 
20110105144639.559|20110105144641.171|TR0|this is thought of as a form of 
20110105144641.171|20110105144642.782|TR0|torture in many places.
20110105144642.782|20110105144644.393|TR0|
20110105144644.393|20110105144646.005|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Well, I was 
20110105144646.005|20110105144647.616|TR0|interested in whether it really 
20110105144647.616|20110105144649.227|TR0|was torture, and I was 
20110105144649.227|20110105144650.839|TR0|interested because this has 
20110105144650.839|20110105144652.450|TR0|become, I think, a 
20110105144652.450|20110105144654.061|TR0|generationally defining question 
20110105144654.061|20110105144655.673|TR0|for us. In the 1980s, during the 
20110105144655.673|20110105144657.284|TR0|Reagan administration, solitary 
20110105144657.284|20110105144658.895|TR0|confinement was very unusual. 
20110105144658.895|20110105144700.507|TR0|Today, we have over 50,000 
20110105144700.507|20110105144702.118|TR0|people in long-term solitary 
20110105144702.118|20110105144703.729|TR0|confinement in our American 
20110105144703.729|20110105144705.341|TR0|prisons now. You know, in states 
20110105144705.341|20110105144706.952|TR0|like New York  --  it's across 
20110105144706.952|20110105144708.563|TR0|every  --  red and blue states. 
20110105144708.563|20110105144710.175|TR0|We have - New York has over 
20110105144710.175|20110105144711.786|TR0|eight percent of its prison 
20110105144711.786|20110105144713.397|TR0|population in long-term solitary 
20110105144713.397|20110105144715.009|TR0|confinement. A large proportion 
20110105144715.009|20110105144716.620|TR0|- some think a majority - are 
20110105144716.620|20110105144718.231|TR0|not there for violent offenses, 
20110105144718.231|20110105144719.843|TR0|either. It's a method of control 
20110105144719.843|20110105144721.454|TR0|that we regard as increasingly 
20110105144721.454|20110105144723.065|TR0|routine. And so, what my puzzle 
20110105144723.065|20110105144724.677|TR0|was, is it torture, or is it not?
20110105144724.677|20110105144726.288|TR0|
20110105144726.288|20110105144727.899|TR0|And what I looked back to was 
20110105144727.899|20110105144729.511|TR0|the experience and the 
20110105144729.511|20110105144731.122|TR0|literature, which is much 
20110105144731.122|20110105144732.733|TR0|richer, around what hostages and 
20110105144732.733|20110105144734.345|TR0|prisoners of war - our Vietnam 
20110105144734.345|20110105144735.956|TR0|veterans, for example - 
20110105144735.956|20110105144737.567|TR0|experienced when they went 
20110105144737.567|20110105144739.179|TR0|through solitary confinement. 
20110105144739.179|20110105144740.790|TR0|And what's found is that people 
20110105144740.790|20110105144742.401|TR0|experience solitary confinement 
20110105144742.401|20110105144744.013|TR0|as even more damaging than 
20110105144744.013|20110105144745.624|TR0|physical torture. Vietnam 
20110105144745.624|20110105144747.236|TR0|veterans who received physical 
20110105144747.236|20110105144748.847|TR0|torture - John McCain had 
20110105144748.847|20110105144750.458|TR0|two-and-a-half years in solitary 
20110105144750.458|20110105144752.070|TR0|confinement, had his legs and 
20110105144752.070|20110105144753.681|TR0|arm broken during his 
20110105144753.681|20110105144755.292|TR0|imprisonment, but described the 
20110105144755.292|20110105144756.904|TR0|two-and-a-half years that he 
20110105144756.904|20110105144758.515|TR0|spent in solitary as being the 
20110105144758.515|20110105144800.126|TR0|most cruel component and the 
20110105144800.126|20110105144801.738|TR0|most terrifying aspect of what 
20110105144801.738|20110105144803.349|TR0|he went under. You also look at 
20110105144803.349|20110105144804.960|TR0|studies that show that people 
20110105144804.960|20110105144806.572|TR0|held in isolation from other 
20110105144806.572|20110105144808.183|TR0|human beings  --  we actually 
20110105144808.183|20110105144809.794|TR0|need social, friendly 
20110105144809.794|20110105144811.406|TR0|interaction with other people to 
20110105144811.406|20110105144813.017|TR0|be sane, to be absolutely  --
20110105144813.017|20110105144814.628|TR0|
20110105144814.628|20110105144816.240|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Right. 
20110105144816.240|20110105144817.851|TR0|You document how people actually 
20110105144817.851|20110105144819.462|TR0|reach a level of psychosis.
20110105144819.462|20110105144821.074|TR0|
20110105144821.074|20110105144822.685|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: That's 
20110105144822.685|20110105144824.296|TR0|right. Not everybody.
20110105144824.296|20110105144825.908|TR0|
20110105144825.908|20110105144827.519|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: They 
20110105144827.519|20110105144829.130|TR0|begin to lose their minds, right?

20110105144830.742|20110105144832.353|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Not 
20110105144832.353|20110105144833.964|TR0|everybody. The people who become 
20110105144833.964|20110105144835.576|TR0|psychotic in solitary 
20110105144835.576|20110105144837.187|TR0|confinement are people who often 
20110105144837.187|20110105144838.798|TR0|have attention deficit disorder 
20110105144838.798|20110105144840.410|TR0|or low IQ or issues of prior 
20110105144840.410|20110105144842.021|TR0|mental illness. Well, guess who 
20110105144842.021|20110105144843.632|TR0|is in our prisons? And there's a 
20110105144843.632|20110105144845.244|TR0|very high rate of psychosis and 
20110105144845.244|20110105144846.855|TR0|people flat-out going crazy 
20110105144846.855|20110105144848.466|TR0|under the confinement 
20110105144848.466|20110105144850.078|TR0|conditions. And so, then what I 
20110105144850.078|20110105144851.689|TR0|puzzle over is, does it actually 
20110105144851.689|20110105144853.300|TR0|reduce our violence in our 
20110105144853.300|20110105144854.912|TR0|prisons? The evidence from 
20110105144854.912|20110105144856.523|TR0|multiple studies now is that not 
20110105144856.523|20110105144858.134|TR0|only that it has not reduced 
20110105144858.134|20110105144859.746|TR0|violence, it's increased the 
20110105144859.746|20110105144901.357|TR0|costs of being in prison. And my 
20110105144901.357|20110105144902.968|TR0|finding was that we have decided 
20110105144902.968|20110105144904.580|TR0|that when it is political - when 
20110105144904.580|20110105144906.191|TR0|it is a prisoner of war or a 
20110105144906.191|20110105144907.802|TR0|hostage, that it is absolutely 
20110105144907.802|20110105144909.414|TR0|torture when other countries do 
20110105144909.414|20110105144911.025|TR0|this to people, and that there 
20110105144911.025|20110105144912.636|TR0|is no discernible difference in 
20110105144912.636|20110105144914.248|TR0|the experience of what people go 
20110105144914.248|20110105144915.859|TR0|through in our prisons, when 
20110105144915.859|20110105144917.470|TR0|they're in solitary confinement 
20110105144917.470|20110105144919.082|TR0|for 14 years, in the case of one 
20110105144919.082|20110105144920.693|TR0|person who I documented, that 
20110105144920.693|20110105144922.305|TR0|this is torture.

20110105144923.916|20110105144925.527|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Atul 
20110105144925.527|20110105144927.139|TR0|Gawande, in this last minute, we 
20110105144927.139|20110105144928.750|TR0|spent an hour with you talking 
20110105144928.750|20110105144930.361|TR0|about The Checklist Manifesto: 
20110105144930.361|20110105144931.973|TR0|How to Get Things Right, when it 
20110105144931.973|20110105144933.584|TR0|first came out. It's out in 
20110105144933.584|20110105144935.195|TR0|paperback today, and we 
20110105144935.195|20110105144936.807|TR0|appreciate that you're back. 
20110105144936.807|20110105144938.418|TR0|What have you most learned? And 
20110105144938.418|20110105144940.029|TR0|for people who aren't familiar 
20110105144940.029|20110105144941.641|TR0|with this idea of the checklist, 
20110105144941.641|20110105144943.252|TR0|you've just got a short amount 
20110105144943.252|20110105144944.863|TR0|of time, so go through all those 
20110105144944.863|20110105144946.475|TR0|-that list and check off all the 
20110105144946.475|20110105144948.086|TR0|points.

20110105144949.697|20110105144951.309|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Yeah, the 
20110105144951.309|20110105144952.920|TR0|key concept here is we think 
20110105144952.920|20110105144954.531|TR0|checklists are for the lowest 
20110105144954.531|20110105144956.143|TR0|people in healthcare or in other 
20110105144956.143|20110105144957.754|TR0|places in society, but never for 
20110105144957.754|20110105144959.365|TR0|the top dogs. But under the 
20110105144959.365|20110105145000.977|TR0|complexity we're under to make 
20110105145000.977|20110105145002.588|TR0|things go right, whether it's in 
20110105145002.588|20110105145004.199|TR0|aviation or in skyscraper 
20110105145004.199|20110105145005.811|TR0|construction or government 
20110105145005.811|20110105145007.422|TR0|programs or in a law office or 
20110105145007.422|20110105145009.033|TR0|in healthcare, having people 
20110105145009.033|20110105145010.645|TR0|think hard and make actual 
20110105145010.645|20110105145012.256|TR0|checklists to go through is 
20110105145012.256|20110105145013.867|TR0|producing some striking 
20110105145013.867|20110105145015.479|TR0|improvements. In surgery, I 
20110105145015.479|20110105145017.090|TR0|introduced a checklist based on 
20110105145017.090|20110105145018.701|TR0|some work that other people had 
20110105145018.701|20110105145020.313|TR0|been doing in surgery, that when 
20110105145020.313|20110105145021.924|TR0|I published the book, we had 
20110105145021.924|20110105145023.535|TR0|shown a 40-plus percent 
20110105145023.535|20110105145025.147|TR0|reduction in mortality in 
20110105145025.147|20110105145026.758|TR0|operating rooms when surgeons 
20110105145026.758|20110105145028.369|TR0|use the checklist. They have now 
20110105145028.369|20110105145029.981|TR0|adopted it in the Netherlands, 
20110105145029.981|20110105145031.592|TR0|in the U.K. and in France. In 
20110105145031.592|20110105145033.203|TR0|the Netherlands, they cut their 
20110105145033.203|20110105145034.815|TR0|death rate 50 percent.

20110105145134.434|20110105145136.046|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: I want 
20110105145136.046|20110105145137.657|TR0|to switch gears for a moment. 
20110105145137.657|20110105145139.268|TR0|You wrote a remarkable piece 
20110105145139.268|20110105145140.880|TR0|about the effects of solitary 
20110105145140.880|20110105145142.491|TR0|confinement on prisoners, on 
20110105145142.491|20110105145144.102|TR0|people who have been held in 
20110105145144.102|20110105145145.714|TR0|isolation for a long time. On 
20110105145145.714|20110105145147.325|TR0|this issue, I just want to turn 
20110105145147.325|20110105145148.936|TR0|to the case of the four 
20110105145148.936|20110105145150.548|TR0|prisoners in a supermax prison, 
20110105145150.548|20110105145152.159|TR0|the Ohio State Penitentiary. 
20110105145152.159|20110105145153.770|TR0|This week they launched a hunger 
20110105145153.770|20110105145155.382|TR0|strike to protest what they call 
20110105145155.382|20110105145156.993|TR0|their harsh mistreatment under 
20110105145156.993|20110105145158.604|TR0|solitary confinement. The 
20110105145158.604|20110105145200.216|TR0|prisoners - Bomani Shakur, 
20110105145200.216|20110105145201.827|TR0|Siddique Abdullah Hasan, Jason 
20110105145201.827|20110105145203.438|TR0|Robb and Namir Abdul Mateen - 
20110105145203.438|20110105145205.050|TR0|were sentenced to death for 
20110105145205.050|20110105145206.661|TR0|their involvement in the 1993 
20110105145206.661|20110105145208.272|TR0|prison uprising in Lucasville, 
20110105145208.272|20110105145209.884|TR0|Ohio. For over 17 years, they've 
20110105145209.884|20110105145211.495|TR0|been held in 23-hours-a-day 
20110105145211.495|20110105145213.106|TR0|solitary lockdown. On Monday, 
20110105145213.106|20110105145214.718|TR0|the four began refusing to eat 
20110105145214.718|20110105145216.329|TR0|meals until they are moved out 
20110105145216.329|20110105145217.940|TR0|of solitary confinement and onto 
20110105145217.940|20110105145219.552|TR0|death row, where they say 
20110105145219.552|20110105145221.163|TR0|they'll get better treatment. 
20110105145221.163|20110105145222.774|TR0|Yesterday I spoke - Amy spoke 
20110105145222.774|20110105145224.386|TR0|with the longtime peace 
20110105145224.386|20110105145225.997|TR0|activist, historian and lawyer, 
20110105145225.997|20110105145227.608|TR0|Staughton Lynd. He wrote the 
20110105145227.608|20110105145229.220|TR0|definitive history of the 1993 
20110105145229.220|20110105145230.831|TR0|Ohio prison uprising at 
20110105145230.831|20110105145232.443|TR0|Lucasville. He described the 
20110105145232.443|20110105145234.054|TR0|prisoners' conditions. Let's 
20110105145234.054|20110105145235.665|TR0|take a listen.
20110105145235.665|20110105145237.277|TR0|
20110105145237.277|20110105145238.888|TR0|>> STAUGHTON LYND: They are held 
20110105145238.888|20110105145240.499|TR0|in more restrictive confinement 
20110105145240.499|20110105145242.111|TR0|than the more than 100 other 
20110105145242.111|20110105145243.722|TR0|death sentence prisoners in the 
20110105145243.722|20110105145245.333|TR0|same prison. Now, why is this? 
20110105145245.333|20110105145246.945|TR0|It's precisely because the 
20110105145246.945|20110105145248.556|TR0|system thinks of them as 
20110105145248.556|20110105145250.167|TR0|leaders. So, it will let them 
20110105145250.167|20110105145251.779|TR0|watch television. They even let 
20110105145251.779|20110105145253.390|TR0|Bomani Shakur use a typewriter. 
20110105145253.390|20110105145255.001|TR0|But what they don't let any of 
20110105145255.001|20110105145256.613|TR0|the four men do is to be in the 
20110105145256.613|20110105145258.224|TR0|same space as another human 
20110105145258.224|20110105145259.835|TR0|being other than a guard at the 
20110105145259.835|20110105145301.447|TR0|same time. And this means that 
20110105145301.447|20110105145303.058|TR0|while other death sentence 
20110105145303.058|20110105145304.669|TR0|prisoners can wander about the 
20110105145304.669|20110105145306.281|TR0|pod, can have collective meals 
20110105145306.281|20110105145307.892|TR0|outside their cells, and 
20110105145307.892|20110105145309.503|TR0|especially can have semi-contact 
20110105145309.503|20110105145311.115|TR0|visits with their friends and 
20110105145311.115|20110105145312.726|TR0|families, the four are always 
20110105145312.726|20110105145314.337|TR0|obliged to encounter the world 
20110105145314.337|20110105145315.949|TR0|either through a solid cell door 
20110105145315.949|20110105145317.560|TR0|or, when they go out on a visit, 
20110105145317.560|20110105145319.171|TR0|through a solid pane of glass. 
20110105145319.171|20110105145320.783|TR0|So that, again, Bomani has a 
20110105145320.783|20110105145322.394|TR0|niece and nephew aged eight and 
20110105145322.394|20110105145324.005|TR0|three that he loves and would 
20110105145324.005|20110105145325.617|TR0|wish to touch. If he were on 
20110105145325.617|20110105145327.228|TR0|death row, he could do that. But 
20110105145327.228|20110105145328.839|TR0|he's been told by the prison 
20110105145328.839|20110105145330.451|TR0|authorities he will never be on 
20110105145330.451|20110105145332.062|TR0|death row, because they're going 
20110105145332.062|20110105145333.673|TR0|to keep him in social isolation 
20110105145333.673|20110105145335.285|TR0|until they kill him.
20110105145335.285|20110105145336.896|TR0|
20110105145336.896|20110105145338.507|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, that is 
20110105145338.507|20110105145340.119|TR0|Staughton Lynd, the longtime 
20110105145340.119|20110105145341.730|TR0|peace activist, lawyer, talking 
20110105145341.730|20110105145343.341|TR0|about these four men who have 
20110105145343.341|20110105145344.953|TR0|now gone on a hunger strike at 
20110105145344.953|20110105145346.564|TR0|the Ohio State Penitentiary, 
20110105145346.564|20110105145348.175|TR0|demanding to be put on death 
20110105145348.175|20110105145349.787|TR0|row, where they say that they 
20110105145349.787|20110105145351.398|TR0|will be treated better.
20110105145351.398|20110105145353.009|TR0|
20110105145353.009|20110105145354.621|TR0|And then we've got the case of 
20110105145354.621|20110105145356.232|TR0|the alleged WikiLeaks Army 
20110105145356.232|20110105145357.843|TR0|whistleblower Bradley Manning, 
20110105145357.843|20110105145359.455|TR0|who's being held in solitary 
20110105145359.455|20110105145401.066|TR0|confinement. Twenty-two years 
20110105145401.066|20110105145402.678|TR0|old, U.S. Army private, arrested 
20110105145402.678|20110105145404.289|TR0|in May, has been in detention 
20110105145404.289|20110105145405.900|TR0|ever since. For the past five 
20110105145405.900|20110105145407.512|TR0|months, he's been held at the 
20110105145407.512|20110105145409.123|TR0|U.S. Marine brig at Quantico, 
20110105145409.123|20110105145410.734|TR0|Virginia, before that, held for 
20110105145410.734|20110105145412.346|TR0|two months in a military jail in 
20110105145412.346|20110105145413.957|TR0|Kuwait. Last month, we spoke to 
20110105145413.957|20110105145415.568|TR0|Glenn Greenwald, the political 
20110105145415.568|20110105145417.180|TR0|and legal blogger at Salon.com. 
20110105145417.180|20110105145418.791|TR0|Glenn reported that Manning is 
20110105145418.791|20110105145420.402|TR0|being held under conditions that 
20110105145420.402|20110105145422.014|TR0|constitute cruel and inhumane 
20110105145422.014|20110105145423.625|TR0|treatment, and even torture. 
20110105145423.625|20110105145425.236|TR0|This is what Glenn Greenwald 
20110105145425.236|20110105145426.848|TR0|said.
20110105145426.848|20110105145428.459|TR0|
20110105145428.459|20110105145430.070|TR0|>> GLENN GREENWALD: He's been 
20110105145430.070|20110105145431.682|TR0|held for seven months without 
20110105145431.682|20110105145433.293|TR0|being convicted of any crime. 
20110105145433.293|20110105145434.904|TR0|And the conditions that I 
20110105145434.904|20110105145436.516|TR0|recently discovered he's being 
20110105145436.516|20110105145438.127|TR0|held in are really quite 
20110105145438.127|20110105145439.738|TR0|disturbing. And this has been 
20110105145439.738|20110105145441.350|TR0|true for the entire seven-month 
20110105145441.350|20110105145442.961|TR0|duration of his detention. He is 
20110105145442.961|20110105145444.572|TR0|in solitary confinement, and 
20110105145444.572|20110105145446.184|TR0|he's not only in solitary 
20110105145446.184|20110105145447.795|TR0|confinement, which means that 
20110105145447.795|20110105145449.406|TR0|he's in a cell alone, but he's 
20110105145449.406|20110105145451.018|TR0|there for 23 out of 24 hours 
20110105145451.018|20110105145452.629|TR0|every day. He is released for 
20110105145452.629|20110105145454.240|TR0|one hour a day only. So, 23 out 
20110105145454.240|20110105145455.852|TR0|of the 24 hours a day he sits 
20110105145455.852|20110105145457.463|TR0|alone. He is barred from even 
20110105145457.463|20110105145459.074|TR0|doing things like exercising 
20110105145459.074|20110105145500.686|TR0|inside of his cell. He's 
20110105145500.686|20110105145502.297|TR0|constantly supervised and 
20110105145502.297|20110105145503.908|TR0|monitored, and if he does that, 
20110105145503.908|20110105145505.520|TR0|he's told immediately to stop. 
20110105145505.520|20110105145507.131|TR0|There are very strict rules 
20110105145507.131|20110105145508.742|TR0|about what he's even allowed to 
20110105145508.742|20110105145510.354|TR0|do inside the cell. Beyond that, 
20110105145510.354|20110105145511.965|TR0|he's being denied just the most 
20110105145511.965|20110105145513.576|TR0|basic attributes of civilized 
20110105145513.576|20110105145515.188|TR0|imprisonment, such as a pillow 
20110105145515.188|20110105145516.799|TR0|and sheets, and has been denied 
20110105145516.799|20110105145518.410|TR0|that without explanation for the 
20110105145518.410|20110105145520.022|TR0|entire duration of his visit, as 
20110105145520.022|20110105145521.633|TR0|well. And there is a lot of 
20110105145521.633|20110105145523.244|TR0|literature and a lot of 
20110105145523.244|20110105145524.856|TR0|psychological studies, and even 
20110105145524.856|20110105145526.467|TR0|studies done by the U.S. 
20110105145526.467|20110105145528.078|TR0|military, that show that 
20110105145528.078|20110105145529.690|TR0|prolonged solitary confinement, 
20110105145529.690|20110105145531.301|TR0|which is something that the 
20110105145531.301|20110105145532.912|TR0|United States does almost more 
20110105145532.912|20110105145534.524|TR0|than any other country in the 
20110105145534.524|20110105145536.135|TR0|Western world, of the type to 
20110105145536.135|20110105145537.747|TR0|which Manning is subjected, can 
20110105145537.747|20110105145539.358|TR0|have a very long-term 
20110105145539.358|20110105145540.969|TR0|psychological damage, including 
20110105145540.969|20110105145542.581|TR0|driving people to insanity and 
20110105145542.581|20110105145544.192|TR0|the like. It clearly is cruel 
20110105145544.192|20110105145545.803|TR0|and unusual; it's arguably a 
20110105145545.803|20110105145547.415|TR0|form of torture. And given that 
20110105145547.415|20110105145549.026|TR0|Manning has never been convicted 
20110105145549.026|20110105145550.637|TR0|of anything, unlike the convicts 
20110105145550.637|20110105145552.249|TR0|at supermaxes to whom this 
20110105145552.249|20110105145553.860|TR0|treatment is normally applied, 
20110105145553.860|20110105145555.471|TR0|it's particularly egregious.
20110105145555.471|20110105145557.083|TR0|
20110105145557.083|20110105145558.694|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: That's 
20110105145558.694|20110105145600.305|TR0|Glenn Greenwald, the political 
20110105145600.305|20110105145601.917|TR0|and legal blogger at Salon.com. 
20110105145601.917|20110105145603.528|TR0|In his piece that he wrote about 
20110105145603.528|20110105145605.139|TR0|Manning, he actually cited your 
20110105145605.139|20110105145606.751|TR0|article "Hellhole," which you 
20110105145606.751|20110105145608.362|TR0|document what happens to people 
20110105145608.362|20110105145609.973|TR0|held in isolation. Explain why 
20110105145609.973|20110105145611.585|TR0|this is thought of as a form of 
20110105145611.585|20110105145613.196|TR0|torture in many places.
20110105145613.196|20110105145614.807|TR0|
20110105145614.807|20110105145616.419|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Well, I was 
20110105145616.419|20110105145618.030|TR0|interested in whether it really 
20110105145618.030|20110105145619.641|TR0|was torture, and I was 
20110105145619.641|20110105145621.253|TR0|interested because this has 
20110105145621.253|20110105145622.864|TR0|become, I think, a 
20110105145622.864|20110105145624.475|TR0|generationally defining question 
20110105145624.475|20110105145626.087|TR0|for us. In the 1980s, during the 
20110105145626.087|20110105145627.698|TR0|Reagan administration, solitary 
20110105145627.698|20110105145629.309|TR0|confinement was very unusual. 
20110105145629.309|20110105145630.921|TR0|Today, we have over 50,000 
20110105145630.921|20110105145632.532|TR0|people in long-term solitary 
20110105145632.532|20110105145634.143|TR0|confinement in our American 
20110105145634.143|20110105145635.755|TR0|prisons now. You know, in states 
20110105145635.755|20110105145637.366|TR0|like New York  --  it's across 
20110105145637.366|20110105145638.977|TR0|every  --  red and blue states. 
20110105145638.977|20110105145640.589|TR0|We have - New York has over 
20110105145640.589|20110105145642.200|TR0|eight percent of its prison 
20110105145642.200|20110105145643.811|TR0|population in long-term solitary 
20110105145643.811|20110105145645.423|TR0|confinement. A large proportion 
20110105145645.423|20110105145647.034|TR0|- some think a majority - are 
20110105145647.034|20110105145648.645|TR0|not there for violent offenses, 
20110105145648.645|20110105145650.257|TR0|either. It's a method of control 
20110105145650.257|20110105145651.868|TR0|that we regard as increasingly 
20110105145651.868|20110105145653.479|TR0|routine. And so, what my puzzle 
20110105145653.479|20110105145655.091|TR0|was, is it torture, or is it not?
20110105145655.091|20110105145656.702|TR0|
20110105145656.702|20110105145658.313|TR0|And what I looked back to was 
20110105145658.313|20110105145659.925|TR0|the experience and the 
20110105145659.925|20110105145701.536|TR0|literature, which is much 
20110105145701.536|20110105145703.147|TR0|richer, around what hostages and 
20110105145703.147|20110105145704.759|TR0|prisoners of war - our Vietnam 
20110105145704.759|20110105145706.370|TR0|veterans, for example - 
20110105145706.370|20110105145707.981|TR0|experienced when they went 
20110105145707.981|20110105145709.593|TR0|through solitary confinement. 
20110105145709.593|20110105145711.204|TR0|And what's found is that people 
20110105145711.204|20110105145712.816|TR0|experience solitary confinement 
20110105145712.816|20110105145714.427|TR0|as even more damaging than 
20110105145714.427|20110105145716.038|TR0|physical torture. Vietnam 
20110105145716.038|20110105145717.650|TR0|veterans who received physical 
20110105145717.650|20110105145719.261|TR0|torture - John McCain had 
20110105145719.261|20110105145720.872|TR0|two-and-a-half years in solitary 
20110105145720.872|20110105145722.484|TR0|confinement, had his legs and 
20110105145722.484|20110105145724.095|TR0|arm broken during his 
20110105145724.095|20110105145725.706|TR0|imprisonment, but described the 
20110105145725.706|20110105145727.318|TR0|two-and-a-half years that he 
20110105145727.318|20110105145728.929|TR0|spent in solitary as being the 
20110105145728.929|20110105145730.540|TR0|most cruel component and the 
20110105145730.540|20110105145732.152|TR0|most terrifying aspect of what 
20110105145732.152|20110105145733.763|TR0|he went under. You also look at 
20110105145733.763|20110105145735.374|TR0|studies that show that people 
20110105145735.374|20110105145736.986|TR0|held in isolation from other 
20110105145736.986|20110105145738.597|TR0|human beings  --  we actually 
20110105145738.597|20110105145740.208|TR0|need social, friendly 
20110105145740.208|20110105145741.820|TR0|interaction with other people to 
20110105145741.820|20110105145743.431|TR0|be sane, to be absolutely  --
20110105145743.431|20110105145745.042|TR0|
20110105145745.042|20110105145746.654|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Right. 
20110105145746.654|20110105145748.265|TR0|You document how people actually 
20110105145748.265|20110105145749.876|TR0|reach a level of psychosis.
20110105145749.876|20110105145751.488|TR0|
20110105145751.488|20110105145753.099|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: That's 
20110105145753.099|20110105145754.710|TR0|right. Not everybody.
20110105145754.710|20110105145756.322|TR0|
20110105145756.322|20110105145757.933|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: They 
20110105145757.933|20110105145759.544|TR0|begin to lose their minds, right?
20110105145759.544|20110105145801.156|TR0|
20110105145801.156|20110105145802.767|TR0|>> DR. ATUL GAWANDE: Not 
20110105145802.767|20110105145804.378|TR0|everybody. The people who become 
20110105145804.378|20110105145805.990|TR0|psychotic in solitary 
20110105145805.990|20110105145807.601|TR0|confinement are people who often 
20110105145807.601|20110105145809.212|TR0|have attention deficit disorder 
20110105145809.212|20110105145810.824|TR0|or low IQ or issues of prior 
20110105145810.824|20110105145812.435|TR0|mental illness. Well, guess who 
20110105145812.435|20110105145814.046|TR0|is in our prisons? And there's a 
20110105145814.046|20110105145815.658|TR0|very high rate of psychosis and 
20110105145815.658|20110105145817.269|TR0|people flat-out going crazy 
20110105145817.269|20110105145818.880|TR0|under the confinement 
20110105145818.880|20110105145820.492|TR0|conditions. And so, then what I 
20110105145820.492|20110105145822.103|TR0|puzzle over is, does it actually 
20110105145822.103|20110105145823.714|TR0|reduce our violence in our 
20110105145823.714|20110105145825.326|TR0|prisons? The evidence from 
20110105145825.326|20110105145826.937|TR0|multiple studies now is that not 
20110105145826.937|20110105145828.548|TR0|only that it has not reduced 
20110105145828.548|20110105145830.160|TR0|violence, it's increased the 
20110105145830.160|20110105145831.771|TR0|costs of being in prison. And my 
20110105145831.771|20110105145833.382|TR0|finding was that we have decided 
20110105145833.382|20110105145834.994|TR0|that when it is political - when 
20110105145834.994|20110105145836.605|TR0|it is a prisoner of war or a 
20110105145836.605|20110105145838.216|TR0|hostage, that it is absolutely 
20110105145838.216|20110105145839.828|TR0|torture when other countries do 
20110105145839.828|20110105145841.439|TR0|this to people, and that there 
20110105145841.439|20110105145843.050|TR0|is no discernible difference in 
20110105145843.050|20110105145844.662|TR0|the experience of what people go 
20110105145844.662|20110105145846.273|TR0|through in our prisons, when 
20110105145846.273|20110105145847.885|TR0|they're in solitary confinement 
20110105145847.885|20110105145849.496|TR0|for 14 years, in the case of one 
20110105145849.496|20110105145851.107|TR0|person who I documented, that 
20110105145851.107|20110105145852.719|TR0|this is torture.
