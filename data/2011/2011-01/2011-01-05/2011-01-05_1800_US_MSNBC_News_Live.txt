20110105180003.000|20110105180005.000|CC1|THAT'S AN ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE FOR
20110105180005.000|20110105180006.000|CC1|ANY PRESS SECRETARY.            
20110105180006.000|20110105180009.000|CC1|IT REMINDS ME OF OTHERS IN THE  
20110105180009.000|20110105180010.000|CC1|PAST WHO VN BEEN VERY CLOSE TO  
20110105180010.000|20110105180011.000|CC1|THEIR PRINCIPALS.               
20110105180011.000|20110105180014.000|CC1|AND THAT GIVES HIM REAL CLOUT.  
20110105180014.000|20110105180017.000|CC1|>> AND WHEN A PRESS SECRETARY   
20110105180017.000|20110105180020.000|CC1|DOESN'T HAVE THAT, NOBODY'S     
20110105180020.000|20110105180021.000|CC1|HAPPY, CERTAINLY.               
20110105180021.000|20110105180023.000|CC1|>> IS THIS A PLUG IN THE DRAIN? 
20110105180023.000|20110105180025.000|CC1|IS THIS GOING TO BEGIN THE REAL 
20110105180025.000|20110105180027.000|CC1|PROCESS NOW WITH HIS DEPARTURE  
20110105180027.000|20110105180029.000|CC1|FORMALLY ANNOUNCED.             
20110105180029.000|20110105180031.000|CC1|WILL WE EXPECT TO SEE A FIRLY   
20110105180031.000|20110105180033.000|CC1|EARLY ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW CHIEF 
20110105180033.000|20110105180035.000|CC1|OF STAFF AND WHITE HOUSERS TO   
20110105180035.000|20110105180038.000|CC1|SUPPORT THE NEW CHIEF?          
20110105180038.000|20110105180040.000|CC1|>> I DON'T KNOW HOW FAST IT'S   
20110105180040.000|20110105180042.000|CC1|GOING TO HAPPEN BUT CLEARLY IF  
20110105180042.000|20110105180043.000|CC1|IT'S BILL DALEY, HE'S GOING TO  
20110105180043.000|20110105180045.000|CC1|WANT TO HAVE A POSITION ON SOME 
20110105180045.000|20110105180047.000|CC1|OF THESE DECISIONS.             
20110105180047.000|20110105180049.000|CC1|BUT I THINK IT SHOES WHILE      
20110105180049.000|20110105180051.000|CC1|THEY'RE TRYING TO CHART THE     
20110105180051.000|20110105180053.000|CC1|LEGISLATION, THEY'RE ALSO       
20110105180053.000|20110105180055.000|CC1|STARTING THE 2012 CAMPAIGN IN   
20110105180055.000|20110105180057.000|CC1|EARNEST, AND THE TOP PEOPLE WHO 
20110105180057.000|20110105180100.000|CC1|HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OBAMA'S CLOSEST
20110105180100.000|20110105180102.000|CC1|ADVISERS AREN'T STAYING IN THE  
20110105180102.000|20110105180103.000|CC1|WHITE HOUSE TO HELP HIM GOVERN. 
20110105180103.000|20110105180104.000|CC1|THEY'RE GOING OUTSIDE.          
20110105180104.000|20110105180106.000|CC1|>> WE'LL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT
20110105180106.000|20110105180109.000|CC1|WHETHER IT'S ADVISABLE TO RUN A 
20110105180109.000|20110105180110.000|CC1|RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN FROM THE   
20110105180110.000|20110105180111.000|CC1|WHITE HOUSE RATHER THAN RUNNING 
20110105180111.000|20110105180112.000|CC1|FROM A FRESH START.             
20110105180112.000|20110105180114.000|CC1|HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO RUN ON HIS
20110105180114.000|20110105180117.000|CC1|RECORD, RUN ON HIS INCUMBENT    
20110105180117.000|20110105180118.000|CC1|PRESIDENT.                      
20110105180118.000|20110105180119.000|CC1|HE CAN'T COME BACK TO CHICAGO   
20110105180119.000|20110105180121.000|CC1|AND START IT ALL OVER.          
20110105180121.000|20110105180124.000|CC1|>> IF IT'S RUN BY THAT RECORD,  
20110105180124.000|20110105180125.000|CC1|MAYBE IT'S DIFFERENT.           
20110105180125.000|20110105180128.000|CC1|>> I THINK IT WOULD BE DECEPTIVE
20110105180128.000|20110105180131.000|CC1|TO THINK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO    
20110105180131.000|20110105180132.000|CC1|HAVE TO --

20110105180139.000|20110105180140.000|CC1|CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR

20110105180141.000|20110105180144.000|CC1|YOU WERE ON ""HARDBALL" LAST    
20110105180144.000|20110105180146.000|CC1|NIGHT, AND THE SAME QUESTION

20110105180147.000|20110105180149.000|CC1|HOW HOFT IS THE GAME GOING TO BE
20110105180149.000|20110105180151.000|CC1|DEFENDING THIS ADMINISTRATION   
20110105180151.000|20110105180155.000|CC1|AGAINST WHAT LOOKS TO BE A      
20110105180155.000|20110105180158.000|CC1|TORRENTIAL ASSAULT AGAINST      
20110105180158.000|20110105180159.000|CC1|CHAIRMAN OF CALIFORNIA?         
20110105180159.000|20110105180205.000|CC1|>> I THINK BASICALLY IT'S GOING 
20110105180205.000|20110105180207.000|CC1|TO FW KIND OF DIFFICULT.        
20110105180207.000|20110105180208.000|CC1|NOT BECAUSE THEY DID ANYTHING   
20110105180208.000|20110105180210.000|CC1|WRONG BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN
20110105180210.000|20110105180212.000|CC1|AVALANCHE OF SUBPOENAS COMING   
20110105180212.000|20110105180216.000|CC1|OUT AND ALL KINDS OF INQUIRIES. 
20110105180216.000|20110105180218.000|CC1|IT REMINDS ME, CHRIS, OF A FEW  
20110105180218.000|20110105180221.000|CC1|YEARS BACK WHEN THE CLINTON     
20110105180221.000|20110105180222.000|CC1|ADMINISTRATION WAS UNDER ATTACK.
20110105180222.000|20110105180224.000|CC1|BUT WE HAVE A STAFF THAT IS     
20110105180224.000|20110105180225.000|CC1|READY, WILLING, AND TABLE TO    
20110105180225.000|20110105180226.000|CC1|ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.           
20110105180226.000|20110105180228.000|CC1|BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR.         
20110105180228.000|20110105180230.000|CC1|WE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE ARE   
20110105180230.000|20110105180232.000|CC1|HOLDING THIS ADMINISTRATION TO A
20110105180232.000|20110105180234.000|CC1|HIGH STANDARD OURSELVES, AND SO 
20110105180234.000|20110105180236.000|CC1|WHAT WE WANT IS FAIRNESS.       
20110105180236.000|20110105180237.000|CC1|WE WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO  
20110105180237.000|20110105180239.000|CC1|SEE THE TOTAL PICTURE, NOT JUST 
20110105180239.000|20110105180240.000|CC1|A PART OF THE PICTURE.          
20110105180240.000|20110105180242.000|CC1|WE JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM 
20110105180242.000|20110105180245.000|CC1|THE WALL STREET JEENTS AND BIG  
20110105180245.000|20110105180246.000|CC1|BUSINESS ASKING THEM WHAT DON'T 
20110105180246.000|20110105180249.000|CC1|THEY LIKE ABOUT REGULATIONS.    
20110105180249.000|20110105180251.000|CC1|BUT WE WANT TO KNOW -- HEAR FROM
20110105180251.000|20110105180253.000|CC1|SMALL BUSINESSES AND OTHERS AS  
20110105180253.000|20110105180255.000|CC1|HOW WE TRULY ADDRESS THE        
20110105180255.000|20110105180257.000|CC1|AMERICAN PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS.     
20110105180257.000|20110105180258.000|CC1|>> CONGRESSMAN, ONE OF THE      
20110105180258.000|20110105180259.000|CC1|REASONS YOU WERE CHOSEN IS      
20110105180259.000|20110105180301.000|CC1|BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS THINK THAT
20110105180301.000|20110105180307.000|CC1|YOU'RE TOUGH ENOUGH TO GO UP    
20110105180307.000|20110105180314.000|CC1|AGAINST.                        
20110105180314.000|20110105180317.000|CC1|IS IT THE DARYL EISEN WHO'S     
20110105180317.000|20110105180318.000|CC1|WALKED THAT BACK IN THE LAST    
20110105180318.000|20110105180320.000|CC1|COUPLE OF DAYS AND SAYS HE WANTS
20110105180320.000|20110105180322.000|CC1|TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION?
20110105180322.000|20110105180323.000|CC1|>> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE   
20110105180323.000|20110105180325.000|CC1|THE FORMER BECAUSE EVEN WHEN HE 
20110105180325.000|20110105180327.000|CC1|SAID HE WAS WALKING IT BACK THE 
20110105180327.000|20110105180329.000|CC1|OTHER DAY HE SAID THAT HE WASN'T
20110105180329.000|20110105180331.000|CC1|ACCUSING THE PRESIDENT OF BEING 
20110105180331.000|20110105180333.000|CC1|CORRUPT, ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT
20110105180333.000|20110105180334.000|CC1|IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY   
20110105180334.000|20110105180336.000|CC1|BUT THEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS    
20110105180336.000|20110105180337.000|CC1|ACCUSING THE ADMINISTRATION,    
20110105180337.000|20110105180338.000|CC1|WHICH I THINK IS WORSE.         
20110105180338.000|20110105180341.000|CC1|I THINK HE'S THEN ACCUSING      
20110105180341.000|20110105180342.000|CC1|EVERYBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION.
20110105180342.000|20110105180343.000|CC1|I THINK IT'S JUST SO UNFAIR.    
20110105180343.000|20110105180346.000|CC1|I JUST GOT A CALL THE OTHER     
20110105180346.000|20110105180349.000|CC1|NIGHT FROM A MEMBER OF A BOARD, 
20110105180349.000|20110105180350.000|CC1|ANOTHER MEMBER ON THE           
20110105180350.000|20110105180350.000|CC1|COMMISSION.                     
20110105180350.000|20110105180352.000|CC1|THESE PEOPLE HAD VOLUNTARILY    
20110105180352.000|20110105180354.000|CC1|GIVEN THEIR SERVICES, TELLING ME
20110105180354.000|20110105180356.000|CC1|THEY HAD GOTTEN LETTERS OR THE  
20110105180356.000|20110105180358.000|CC1|WORD FROM MR. EISEN THAT HE     
20110105180358.000|20110105180359.000|CC1|WOULD BE LOOKING TO THEM.       
20110105180359.000|20110105180400.000|CC1|THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEVER HAD A
20110105180400.000|20110105180401.000|CC1|PROBLEM WITH THE LAW.           
20110105180401.000|20110105180404.000|CC1|NOW THEY'RE FOBT TO GO OUT AND  
20110105180404.000|20110105180405.000|CC1|HIRE LAWYERS.                   
20110105180405.000|20110105180406.000|CC1|I THINK TO DEFEND THEMSELVES    
20110105180406.000|20110105180408.000|CC1|AGAINST TRYING TO BE HELPFUL TO 
20110105180408.000|20110105180408.000|CC1|GOVERNMENT.                     
20110105180408.000|20110105180409.000|CC1|THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE, 
20110105180409.000|20110105180411.000|CC1|AND I THINK IT'S VERY           
20110105180411.000|20110105180413.000|CC1|UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT 
20110105180413.000|20110105180414.000|CC1|ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF CREATING  
20110105180414.000|20110105180416.000|CC1|JOBS, HELPING THE MIDDLE CLASS, 
20110105180416.000|20110105180418.000|CC1|AND ADDRESSING THIS DEBT AND

20110105180419.000|20110105180421.000|CC1|AND SO WE'RE GOING TO -- WE'RE  
20110105180421.000|20110105180422.000|CC1|GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AS  
20110105180422.000|20110105180427.000|CC1|THEY COME, DEMAND FAIRNESS, AND 
20110105180427.000|20110105180430.000|CC1|IF WE SEE THE WITCH HUNTS

20110105181753.000|20110105181756.000|CC1|CAREER AND WE DON'T THINK OF

20110105181817.000|20110105181818.000|CC1|OPERATION AS WELL, BUT I THINK  
20110105181818.000|20110105181820.000|CC1|ARE A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY THEY
20110105181820.000|20110105181822.000|CC1|NEED SOMEONE OF THAT STATURE.   
20110105181822.000|20110105181823.000|CC1|IT'S NOT JUST BUSINESSPEOPLE.   
20110105181823.000|20110105181826.000|CC1|BY THE WAY, I THINK IN HIS ROLE 
20110105181826.000|20110105181827.000|CC1|AS COMMERCE SECRETARY, HE DID   
20110105181827.000|20110105181830.000|CC1|GET TO KNOW A LOT OF THE CEOs.

20110105181837.000|20110105181838.000|CC1|IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY WANT TO 
20110105181838.000|20110105181840.000|CC1|TALK TO A MAJOR FIGURE IF THEY  
20110105181840.000|20110105181842.000|CC1|CAN'T GET TO THE PRESIDENT.     
20110105181842.000|20110105181845.000|CC1|IT'S ALSO HEADS OF STATE.       
20110105181845.000|20110105181847.000|CC1|>> YOU TOO.

20110105181850.000|20110105181851.000|CC1|>> WITH ALL RESPECT TO PETE

20110105183303.000|20110105183304.000|CC1|YOU THINK THE LAST ELECTION MAY 
20110105183304.000|20110105183307.000|CC1|NOT BE AS FICKLE AS THE ONE --  
20110105183307.000|20110105183309.000|CC1|IT WON'T MOVE AS QUICKLY BACK IN

20110105183309.000|20110105183311.000|CC1|BUT I GUESS THERE'S A QUESTION  
20110105183311.000|20110105183312.000|CC1|NOW ABOUT LEADERSHIP.           
20110105183312.000|20110105183314.000|CC1|DO YOU SEE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
20110105183314.000|20110105183316.000|CC1|COMING APART?                   
20110105183316.000|20110105183317.000|CC1|I JUST GOT THE REPORT FROM MAJOR
20110105183317.000|20110105183319.000|CC1|GARRETT THAT THEY SEE A LOT OF  
20110105183319.000|20110105183321.000|CC1|THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE       
20110105183321.000|20110105183322.000|CC1|MEMBERS WILL VOTE AGAINST HEALTH
20110105183322.000|20110105183323.000|CC1|CARE AS THEY HAD BEFORE.        
20110105183323.000|20110105183325.000|CC1|I DON'T SEE THAT AS A FRAYING OF
20110105183325.000|20110105183327.000|CC1|THE EDGE YESTERDAY, DO YOU?     
20110105183327.000|20110105183330.000|CC1|>> THERE'S OBVIOUSLY IDEOLOGICAL
20110105183330.000|20110105183331.000|CC1|DIVISIONS AND OTHERS WITHIN THE 
20110105183331.000|20110105183332.000|CC1|PARTY.                          
20110105183332.000|20110105183335.000|CC1|SO IT'S A FINE STRATEGY FOR CAN 
20110105183335.000|20110105183338.000|CC1|TORE TO TRY TO PICK AT THOSE    
20110105183338.000|20110105183339.000|CC1|SCALPS, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT  
20110105183339.000|20110105183344.000|CC1|THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS AT RISK 
20110105183344.000|20110105183345.000|CC1|OF UNRAVELING.                  
20110105183345.000|20110105183347.000|CC1|IT'S EASIER TO STAY UNIFIED IN

20110105183348.000|20110105183350.000|CC1|BECAUSE I THINK EVERY DEMOCRAT  
20110105183350.000|20110105183352.000|CC1|WOULD BE UNIFIED AND SORT OF NOT
20110105183352.000|20110105183353.000|CC1|IN THE DIRECTION THAT SPEAKER

20110105183355.000|20110105183356.000|CC1|SO IN SOME WAYS THEY'RE GOING TO

20110105183359.000|20110105183400.000|CC1|THAN THEY WERE IN THE PAST TWO
