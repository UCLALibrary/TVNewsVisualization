20110105180007.000|20110105180008.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST, "SITUATION ROOM":  
20110105180008.000|20110105180010.000|TR0|Up on Capitol Hill, they're voting for the 
20110105180010.000|20110105180012.000|TR0|next speaker of the House.  We know John 
20110105180012.000|20110105180014.000|TR0|Boehner will win.  The Republicans will 
20110105180014.000|20110105180016.000|TR0|have 242 members.  On the Senate side, 
20110105180016.000|20110105180017.000|TR0|they've been paying tribute to Barbara 
20110105180017.000|20110105180019.000|TR0|Mikulski.  The longest serving woman to 
20110105180019.000|20110105180021.000|TR0|serve in the United States Senate.  
20110105180021.000|20110105180023.000|TR0|Republicans and Democrats paying tribute 
20110105180023.000|20110105180025.000|TR0|to Barbara Mikulski as well.
20110105180025.000|20110105180026.000|TR0|
20110105180026.000|20110105180028.000|TR0|Gloria, the shift at the White House, the 
20110105180028.000|20110105180030.000|TR0|changes that are going on there's always 
20110105180030.000|20110105180032.000|TR0|some changes, but is it more now than in 
20110105180032.000|20110105180034.000|TR0|years past at the two-year mark of the 
20110105180034.000|20110105180036.000|TR0|first term.
20110105180036.000|20110105180037.000|TR0|
20110105180037.000|20110105180039.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110105180039.000|20110105180041.000|TR0|ANALYST:  Well, the two-year mark is 
20110105180041.000|20110105180043.000|TR0|always the perfect time to make changes.  
20110105180043.000|20110105180045.000|TR0|And, I think, there's been a sense, both 
20110105180045.000|20110105180046.000|TR0|inside Washington and outside of 
20110105180046.000|20110105180048.000|TR0|Washington, that this administration has 
20110105180048.000|20110105180050.000|TR0|been an administration that's had the same 
20110105180050.000|20110105180052.000|TR0|group of people for years and years and 
20110105180052.000|20110105180054.000|TR0|years around Barack Obama. Robert Gibbs 
20110105180054.000|20110105180056.000|TR0|has been with Barack Obama since his days 
20110105180056.000|20110105180057.000|TR0|in the Senate in 2004.
20110105180057.000|20110105180059.000|TR0|
20110105180059.000|20110105180101.000|TR0|And, so, you do have a bubble within the 
20110105180101.000|20110105180103.000|TR0|bubble.  And, so, this may be a moment to 
20110105180103.000|20110105180105.000|TR0|bring in some different people.  Now, 
20110105180105.000|20110105180106.000|TR0|David Plouffe, as Candy pointed out during 
20110105180106.000|20110105180108.000|TR0|the break, we were talking, is not exactly 
20110105180108.000|20110105180110.000|TR0|new.  He ran Barack Obama's campaign.  
20110105180110.000|20110105180112.000|TR0|Bill Daley is not new to the political 
20110105180112.000|20110105180114.000|TR0|scene, but he doesn't really know Barack 
20110105180114.000|20110105180116.000|TR0|Obama, very well. So, he may be considered 
20110105180116.000|20110105180117.000|TR0|as somebody who'd have a different point 
20110105180117.000|20110105180119.000|TR0|of view.
20110105180119.000|20110105180121.000|TR0|
20110105180121.000|20110105180123.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL 
20110105180123.000|20110105180125.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Donna Brazile, Bill Daley 
20110105180125.000|20110105180126.000|TR0|is rumored to be the next White House 
20110105180126.000|20110105180128.000|TR0|chief of staff.  The former commerce 
20110105180128.000|20110105180130.000|TR0|secretary, during the Clinton 
20110105180130.000|20110105180132.000|TR0|administration, the brother of the 
20110105180132.000|20110105180134.000|TR0|outgoing mayor of Chicago.  There are some 
20110105180134.000|20110105180136.000|TR0|liberals who are not happy with Bill 
20110105180136.000|20110105180137.000|TR0|Daley.  They don't like his stance on 
20110105180137.000|20110105180139.000|TR0|financial regulation.  They don't -- they 
20110105180139.000|20110105180141.000|TR0|didn't like his stance on health care 
20110105180141.000|20110105180143.000|TR0|reform, and they are making their views 
20110105180143.000|20110105180145.000|TR0|pretty clear, right now, that he's not as 
20110105180145.000|20110105180146.000|TR0|quote, "progressive or liberal" enough as 
20110105180146.000|20110105180148.000|TR0|they would like.
20110105180148.000|20110105180150.000|TR0|
20110105180150.000|20110105180152.000|TR0|DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  
20110105180152.000|20110105180154.000|TR0|And, I think, what the President is 
20110105180154.000|20110105180155.000|TR0|looking for is a good manager, and Bill 
20110105180155.000|20110105180157.000|TR0|Daley is a great manager.  He has a strong 
20110105180157.000|20110105180159.000|TR0|rolodex.  He knows people, inside and out 
20110105180159.000|20110105180201.000|TR0|in Washington, D.C.  I think, he will 
20110105180201.000|20110105180203.000|TR0|bring to the White House, if the President 
20110105180203.000|20110105180205.000|TR0|decides to put him in that position, the 
20110105180205.000|20110105180206.000|TR0|ability to make a lot of phone calls.  Not 
20110105180206.000|20110105180208.000|TR0|just on Wall Street, but, also, on main 
20110105180208.000|20110105180210.000|TR0|street.  So, I think he will, you know, be 
20110105180210.000|20110105180212.000|TR0|a good addition to the team.
20110105180212.000|20110105180214.000|TR0|
20110105180214.000|20110105180215.000|TR0|But let me just go back and say something 
20110105180215.000|20110105180217.000|TR0|about Robert Gibbs.  I've known him for a 
20110105180217.000|20110105180219.000|TR0|long time.  He's a tenacious public 
20110105180219.000|20110105180221.000|TR0|servant.  But, you know, I think, Robert 
20110105180221.000|20110105180223.000|TR0|Gibbs has really spent a lot of time, over 
20110105180223.000|20110105180225.000|TR0|the last couple of weeks, you know, 
20110105180225.000|20110105180226.000|TR0|figuring out what's the best way to serve 
20110105180226.000|20110105180228.000|TR0|the President.  Should he stay in the 
20110105180228.000|20110105180230.000|TR0|White House, should he go over to the DNC. 
20110105180230.000|20110105180232.000|TR0| He's decided to go into the private 
20110105180232.000|20110105180234.000|TR0|sector, he'll be an asset to the President 
20110105180234.000|20110105180235.000|TR0|outside the White House.
20110105180235.000|20110105180237.000|TR0|
20110105180237.000|20110105180239.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, Donna, stand by.  
20110105180239.000|20110105180241.000|TR0|John King is up on Capitol Hill with Bill 
20110105180241.000|20110105180243.000|TR0|Bennett, our CNN contributor, as well.  
20110105180243.000|20110105180245.000|TR0|I'm sure that Bill, John, has some 
20110105180245.000|20110105180246.000|TR0|thoughts on this historic day as well.
20110105180246.000|20110105180248.000|TR0|
20110105180248.000|20110105180250.000|TR0|JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL 
20110105180250.000|20110105180252.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  He sure does, Wolf. 
20110105180252.000|20110105180254.000|TR0|Because you were talking about the changes 
20110105180254.000|20110105180255.000|TR0|at the White House.  That is part of the 
20110105180255.000|20110105180257.000|TR0|traditional two-year transfer.  What we 
20110105180257.000|20110105180259.000|TR0|have here on Capitol Hill is he has part 
20110105180259.000|20110105180301.000|TR0|of a traditional post-election transfer, 
20110105180301.000|20110105180303.000|TR0|but it is anything but ordinary.  You have 
20110105180303.000|20110105180305.000|TR0|Bill Bennett, as he joins us, now, our CNN 
20110105180305.000|20110105180306.000|TR0|contributor, our conservative, our 
20110105180306.000|20110105180308.000|TR0|resident (ph) philosopher, if you will.  
20110105180308.000|20110105180310.000|TR0|You have this huge new team on the House 
20110105180310.000|20110105180312.000|TR0|side.  You have a new team on Senate side. 
20110105180312.000|20110105180314.000|TR0| You were just with one of the new 
20110105180314.000|20110105180315.000|TR0|Republican stars, Marco Rubio, in the 
20110105180315.000|20110105180317.000|TR0|Senate side.
20110105180317.000|20110105180319.000|TR0|
20110105180319.000|20110105180321.000|TR0|Assess the moment, and, also, if you 
20110105180321.000|20110105180323.000|TR0|could, assess the risks for tension and 
20110105180323.000|20110105180325.000|TR0|disappointment.  And, then, already, we 
20110105180325.000|20110105180326.000|TR0|hear the House Republicans say they were 
20110105180326.000|20110105180328.000|TR0|going to cut $100 billion right away.  
20110105180328.000|20110105180330.000|TR0|Now, they are scaling back, saying, well, 
20110105180330.000|20110105180332.000|TR0|maybe we can only do 50.  What happens if 
20110105180332.000|20110105180334.000|TR0|the air comes out of the balloon?
20110105180334.000|20110105180335.000|TR0|
20110105180335.000|20110105180337.000|TR0|WILLIAM BENNETT, CNN POLITICAL 
20110105180337.000|20110105180339.000|TR0|CONTRIBUTOR, NATIONAL TALK RADIO HOST: 
20110105180339.000|20110105180341.000|TR0|Well, first, if you don't mind, a moment 
20110105180341.000|20110105180343.000|TR0|of exuberance.  We just came - or I just 
20110105180343.000|20110105180344.000|TR0|came from the Marco Rubio Reception, and 
20110105180344.000|20110105180346.000|TR0|the word, there, was, well, was we have 
20110105180346.000|20110105180348.000|TR0|our vice president, now, for 2012.  We 
20110105180348.000|20110105180350.000|TR0|just have to pick the number one spot.  
20110105180350.000|20110105180352.000|TR0|Well, a lot of interest, a lot of 
20110105180352.000|20110105180354.000|TR0|enthusiasm.  Look, I think this is the 
20110105180354.000|20110105180355.000|TR0|best team we've had on the field as 
20110105180355.000|20110105180357.000|TR0|Republicans in a very long time.  And --
20110105180357.000|20110105180359.000|TR0|
20110105180359.000|20110105180401.000|TR0|KING:  As a veteran of the Reagan days, 
20110105180401.000|20110105180403.000|TR0|that's a big thing to say.
20110105180403.000|20110105180404.000|TR0|
20110105180404.000|20110105180406.000|TR0|BENNETT:  Absolutely.  I think so, in 
20110105180406.000|20110105180408.000|TR0|terms of debt, of the extent of the 
20110105180408.000|20110105180410.000|TR0|seriousness of this group, and, I think, 
20110105180410.000|20110105180412.000|TR0|it's an even a more serious group than we 
20110105180412.000|20110105180414.000|TR0|saw in '94.  These guys are full of 
20110105180414.000|20110105180415.000|TR0|resolve in convection.  It's, also, a 
20110105180415.000|20110105180417.000|TR0|different looking Republican Party, which 
20110105180417.000|20110105180419.000|TR0|is a good thing for this (ph).  We're big. 
20110105180419.000|20110105180421.000|TR0| We're 243.  So, there will be divisions.  
20110105180421.000|20110105180423.000|TR0|There will be differences.  And we will -- 
20110105180423.000|20110105180424.000|TR0|and we will continue with this to start 
20110105180424.000|20110105180426.000|TR0|from day one, some of these differences, 
20110105180426.000|20110105180428.000|TR0|but, I think, you will see us, for the 
20110105180428.000|20110105180430.000|TR0|most part, as a large flanks (ph) moving 
20110105180430.000|20110105180432.000|TR0|forward.
20110105180432.000|20110105180434.000|TR0|
20110105180434.000|20110105180435.000|TR0|KING:  So, as we're watching, our viewers 
20110105180435.000|20110105180437.000|TR0|can see on the left side of their screen, 
20110105180437.000|20110105180439.000|TR0|there, that is -- that is the roll call of 
20110105180439.000|20110105180441.000|TR0|the House. That will make John Boehner of 
20110105180441.000|20110105180443.000|TR0|Ohio the speaker of the house in just 
20110105180443.000|20110105180444.000|TR0|moments here.  You mentioned, this large 
20110105180444.000|20110105180446.000|TR0|flanks (ph) moving forward. You have 
20110105180446.000|20110105180448.000|TR0|conservatives.  You have people who came 
20110105180448.000|20110105180450.000|TR0|here with firmly said (ph) campaign 
20110105180450.000|20110105180452.000|TR0|promises.  Where does the movement bump 
20110105180452.000|20110105180454.000|TR0|into the -- what happens, here in 
20110105180454.000|20110105180455.000|TR0|Washington, the realism, the pragmatism?  
20110105180455.000|20110105180457.000|TR0|Even Boehner, himself, said he doesn't 
20110105180457.000|20110105180459.000|TR0|like to use the word, compromise. He 
20110105180459.000|20110105180501.000|TR0|prefers to say, common ground, because 
20110105180501.000|20110105180503.000|TR0|compromise, somehow, is at very faint (ph).
20110105180503.000|20110105180504.000|TR0|
20110105180504.000|20110105180506.000|TR0|BENNETT:  I think the movement has won.  
20110105180506.000|20110105180508.000|TR0|If we need to declare a winner, the 
20110105180508.000|20110105180510.000|TR0|movement has won.  But I've been saying to 
20110105180510.000|20110105180512.000|TR0|John Boehner and others, there's a 
20110105180512.000|20110105180514.000|TR0|distinction of willingness on principle to 
20110105180514.000|20110105180515.000|TR0|compromise, which is fine, and the 
20110105180515.000|20110105180517.000|TR0|willingness to compromise on principle, 
20110105180517.000|20110105180519.000|TR0|which is not fine.  We made a deal in 
20110105180519.000|20110105180521.000|TR0|December.  We made a deal on the taxes.  
20110105180521.000|20110105180523.000|TR0|Continuing the Bush tax rates.  That was a 
20110105180523.000|20110105180524.000|TR0|compromise.
20110105180524.000|20110105180526.000|TR0|
20110105180526.000|20110105180528.000|TR0|And I've been arguing with my audience -- 
20110105180528.000|20110105180530.000|TR0|with my radio audience on this, some, 
20110105180530.000|20110105180532.000|TR0|John, but it was a good compromise.  It 
20110105180532.000|20110105180533.000|TR0|was good for us. We deserved those tax 
20110105180533.000|20110105180535.000|TR0|cuts.  So, I think, these differences will 
20110105180535.000|20110105180537.000|TR0|be hammered out in detail.  You'll see it 
20110105180537.000|20110105180539.000|TR0|each time.  You'll see it on the health 
20110105180539.000|20110105180541.000|TR0|care.  You'll see it on the debt -- on the 
20110105180541.000|20110105180543.000|TR0|debt ceiling limit and on almost 
20110105180543.000|20110105180544.000|TR0|everything else.  But you've got huge 
20110105180544.000|20110105180546.000|TR0|agreement on 80-85 percent of these issues.
20110105180546.000|20110105180548.000|TR0|
20110105180548.000|20110105180550.000|TR0|KING:  Well, Blitz (ph), I want Erick 
20110105180550.000|20110105180552.000|TR0|Erickson to join the conversation, because 
20110105180552.000|20110105180553.000|TR0|in Bill Bennett, we have a veteran of the 
20110105180553.000|20110105180555.000|TR0|conservative movement going back to the 
20110105180555.000|20110105180557.000|TR0|Reagan days or before that. Erick, from 
20110105180557.000|20110105180559.000|TR0|RedState.com, is a younger member of the 
20110105180559.000|20110105180601.000|TR0|conservative movement, a Tea Party ally, 
20110105180601.000|20110105180603.000|TR0|if you will.  I want -- Bill, to you, 
20110105180603.000|20110105180604.000|TR0|first.  You're a veteran of divided 
20110105180604.000|20110105180606.000|TR0|government.  Ronald Reagan had to deal 
20110105180606.000|20110105180608.000|TR0|with divided government.  You mentioned 
20110105180608.000|20110105180610.000|TR0|the 1994 class.  They had to deal with a 
20110105180610.000|20110105180612.000|TR0|Democratic president when (ph) came to 
20110105180612.000|20110105180613.000|TR0|power of the House of Representatives.  
20110105180613.000|20110105180615.000|TR0|How do you map it out?  Where do you hold 
20110105180615.000|20110105180617.000|TR0|your ground, and say, absolutely not, Mr.  
20110105180617.000|20110105180619.000|TR0|President.  And where do you say, all 
20110105180619.000|20110105180621.000|TR0|right, we have to cut a deal?
20110105180621.000|20110105180623.000|TR0|
20110105180623.000|20110105180624.000|TR0|BENNETT:  I think it will depend on the 
20110105180624.000|20110105180626.000|TR0|issue, John.  But just as Holmes used to 
20110105180626.000|20110105180628.000|TR0|say, there, you can't help things you just 
20110105180628.000|20110105180630.000|TR0|can't help but believe and hold on to.  
20110105180630.000|20110105180632.000|TR0|And, I think, some of these things, like 
20110105180632.000|20110105180633.000|TR0|health care, which we're already in a big 
20110105180633.000|20110105180635.000|TR0|fight about, Republicans won't lift out of 
20110105180635.000|20110105180637.000|TR0|the that process, not a single Republican 
20110105180637.000|20110105180639.000|TR0|voted for Obama care. You're going to see 
20110105180639.000|20110105180641.000|TR0|people go to the mat on all that.  Cutting 
20110105180641.000|20110105180643.000|TR0|the deficits.  Getting those deficits 
20110105180643.000|20110105180644.000|TR0|down.  Major budget cuts.
20110105180644.000|20110105180646.000|TR0|
20110105180646.000|20110105180648.000|TR0|As you know, I think, one of the pivotal 
20110105180648.000|20110105180650.000|TR0|guides in this operation is Paul Ryan, the 
20110105180650.000|20110105180652.000|TR0|new chairman of the budget committee.  See 
20110105180652.000|20110105180653.000|TR0|the powers that have been already been 
20110105180653.000|20110105180655.000|TR0|seated, a little bit, from appropriations 
20110105180655.000|20110105180657.000|TR0|to budget.  See how many freshman want to 
20110105180657.000|20110105180659.000|TR0|get on that budget committee.  That's 
20110105180659.000|20110105180701.000|TR0|where a lot of the fight's going to be.
20110105180701.000|20110105180703.000|TR0|
20110105180703.000|20110105180704.000|TR0|KING:  Erik Ericson, does that make sense? 
20110105180704.000|20110105180706.000|TR0| Is that a young Turk, if you will, my 
20110105180706.000|20110105180708.000|TR0|terminology in the movement, are you in 
20110105180708.000|20110105180710.000|TR0|full sync with Bill Bennett, or are there 
20110105180710.000|20110105180712.000|TR0|some tensions, as this new breed comes to 
20110105180712.000|20110105180713.000|TR0|Washington, running into the guys who have 
20110105180713.000|20110105180715.000|TR0|been here for five or eight or, maybe, 15 
20110105180715.000|20110105180717.000|TR0|or 20 years, saying, you know, slow down, 
20110105180717.000|20110105180719.000|TR0|kid, it doesn't work that way?
20110105180719.000|20110105180721.000|TR0|
20110105180721.000|20110105180722.000|TR0|ERICK ERICKSON, CONTRIBUTOR AND 
20110105180722.000|20110105180724.000|TR0|CONSERVATIVE, REDSTATE.COM:  Well, there 
20110105180724.000|20110105180726.000|TR0|are always going to be some tensions.  I 
20110105180726.000|20110105180728.000|TR0|think, though, that Bill's right.  You can 
20110105180728.000|20110105180730.000|TR0|compromise with the President.  You can 
20110105180730.000|20110105180732.000|TR0|compromise internally with other 
20110105180732.000|20110105180733.000|TR0|Republicans.  It's a matter of what are 
20110105180733.000|20110105180735.000|TR0|your principles, though.  And you will 
20110105180735.000|20110105180737.000|TR0|have, in some cases, some of the younger 
20110105180737.000|20110105180739.000|TR0|guys coming in, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, on 
20110105180739.000|20110105180741.000|TR0|the Senate side, even, Marco Rubio, who 
20110105180741.000|20110105180742.000|TR0|have principles or they have things that 
20110105180742.000|20110105180744.000|TR0|they view as principles and they're not 
20110105180744.000|20110105180746.000|TR0|going to be willing to compromise on 
20110105180746.000|20110105180748.000|TR0|those.  You'll have internal struggles, 
20110105180748.000|20110105180750.000|TR0|and you'll have external struggles.
20110105180750.000|20110105180752.000|TR0|
20110105180752.000|20110105180753.000|TR0|Largely, though, I mean, and to Bill's 
20110105180753.000|20110105180755.000|TR0|point to say that the Republicans aren't 
20110105180755.000|20110105180757.000|TR0|willing to compromise, or they are going 
20110105180757.000|20110105180759.000|TR0|to shut down the Senate, this debate over 
20110105180759.000|20110105180801.000|TR0|the filibuster, for example, last I 
20110105180801.000|20110105180802.000|TR0|checked, the Democrats were able to get 
20110105180802.000|20110105180804.000|TR0|health care out of the Senate. They were 
20110105180804.000|20110105180806.000|TR0|able to get the S.T.A.R.T. Treaty out.  
20110105180806.000|20110105180808.000|TR0|They were able to get Don't Ask Don't Tell 
20110105180808.000|20110105180810.000|TR0|repealed, and a whole host of other 
20110105180810.000|20110105180812.000|TR0|issues. They're going to compromise.  It's 
20110105180812.000|20110105180813.000|TR0|just on what they compromise. It'll be on 
20110105180813.000|20110105180815.000|TR0|a case-by-case basis.
20110105180815.000|20110105180817.000|TR0|
20110105180817.000|20110105180819.000|TR0|BENNETT:  We're here at the Russell office 
20110105180819.000|20110105180821.000|TR0|building.  Elaine and I were walking up 
20110105180821.000|20110105180822.000|TR0|looking at the history (ph), here.  We 
20110105180822.000|20110105180824.000|TR0|have three branches of government.  
20110105180824.000|20110105180826.000|TR0|Republicans control one-half of one 
20110105180826.000|20110105180828.000|TR0|branch. That's not full control by any 
20110105180828.000|20110105180830.000|TR0|stretch of the imagination.
20110105180830.000|20110105180832.000|TR0|
20110105180832.000|20110105180833.000|TR0|KING:  But it is important.
20110105180833.000|20110105180835.000|TR0|
20110105180835.000|20110105180837.000|TR0|BENNETT:  Oh, it is important.
20110105180837.000|20110105180839.000|TR0|
20110105180839.000|20110105180841.000|TR0|KING:  Bill Bennett, thanks very visiting 
20110105180841.000|20110105180842.000|TR0|with us.  Wolf, as we go back to you, Bill 
20110105180842.000|20110105180844.000|TR0|makes an employment plight about the 
20110105180844.000|20110105180846.000|TR0|history, here. There's a lot of substance 
20110105180846.000|20110105180848.000|TR0|that we will deal with in the days and 
20110105180848.000|20110105180850.000|TR0|weeks ahead.  There's a lot of ceremony, 
20110105180850.000|20110105180852.000|TR0|today.  And we should, also, as we reflect 
20110105180852.000|20110105180853.000|TR0|on this day, consider the history.  The 
20110105180853.000|20110105180855.000|TR0|American people are not strangers to 
20110105180855.000|20110105180857.000|TR0|divided government.  We'll see how this 
20110105180857.000|20110105180859.000|TR0|chapter of it plays out.
20110105180859.000|20110105180901.000|TR0|
20110105180901.000|20110105180902.000|TR0|BENNETT:  Right.

20110105180904.000|20110105180906.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes, and let's not forget, John 
20110105180906.000|20110105180908.000|TR0|Boehner, he is going to be the next 
20110105180908.000|20110105180910.000|TR0|speaker of the House of Representatives.  
20110105180910.000|20110105180911.000|TR0|We're getting ready for that gavel to be 
20110105180911.000|20110105180913.000|TR0|given to him, as well.  Nancy Pelosi, out. 
20110105180913.000|20110105180915.000|TR0| John Boehner, in.  We're talking history. 
20110105180915.000|20110105180917.000|TR0| This is a very historic day, here, in 
20110105180917.000|20110105180919.000|TR0|Washington, D.C., history of the United 
20110105180919.000|20110105180921.000|TR0|States.  On the Senate floor, by the way, 
20110105180921.000|20110105180922.000|TR0|the president pro tem of the Senate, 
20110105180922.000|20110105180924.000|TR0|Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, he's the new 
20110105180924.000|20110105180926.000|TR0|president pro tem of the Senate.  That 
20110105180926.000|20110105180928.000|TR0|means he, after the speaker next in line 
20110105180928.000|20110105180930.000|TR0|for the presidency, god forbid if anything 
20110105180930.000|20110105180931.000|TR0|were to happen to the president, the Vice 
20110105180931.000|20110105180933.000|TR0|President, Speaker would take over after 
20110105180933.000|20110105180935.000|TR0|the Speaker is the President Pro Tem 
20110105180935.000|20110105180937.000|TR0|Daniel Inouye.  The longest serving 
20110105180937.000|20110105180939.000|TR0|Democrat in the US Senate. For a long 
20110105180939.000|20110105180941.000|TR0|time, it was Robert Byrd of West Virginia. 
20110105180941.000|20110105180942.000|TR0| The president pro tem of the Senate, but 
20110105180942.000|20110105180944.000|TR0|now it will be Daniel Inouye.  We're going 
20110105180944.000|20110105180946.000|TR0|to continue our coverage in just a moment, 
20110105180946.000|20110105180948.000|TR0|of this, the opening day of the 112th 
20110105180948.000|20110105180950.000|TR0|Congress.

20110105180953.000|20110105180955.000|TR0|
20110105180955.000|20110105180957.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Welcome back.  We're covering 
20110105180957.000|20110105180959.000|TR0|the new Congress.  This is the opening day 
20110105180959.000|20110105181001.000|TR0|of the 112th Congress.  We're standing by. 
20110105181001.000|20110105181002.000|TR0| There's going to be a new speaker of the 
20110105181002.000|20110105181004.000|TR0|House.  You're looking at the House floor 
20110105181004.000|20110105181006.000|TR0|on the left part of your screen.  John 
20110105181006.000|20110105181008.000|TR0|Boehner will be elected speaker of the 
20110105181008.000|20110105181010.000|TR0|house.  On the right side, you see the 
20110105181010.000|20110105181011.000|TR0|re-elected majority leader in the Senate, 
20110105181011.000|20110105181013.000|TR0|Harry Reid, but his majority has gone down 
20110105181013.000|20110105181015.000|TR0|to 53 to 47 Republicans in the Senate.  
20110105181015.000|20110105181017.000|TR0|Lots going on, here, in Washington on this 
20110105181017.000|20110105181019.000|TR0|day, as well as over at the White House.  
20110105181019.000|20110105181021.000|TR0|You saw Robert Gibbs telling reporters 
20110105181021.000|20110105181022.000|TR0|he's stepping down as the White House 
20110105181022.000|20110105181024.000|TR0|press secretary within a month.  The 
20110105181024.000|20110105181026.000|TR0|President looking for a new press 
20110105181026.000|20110105181028.000|TR0|secretary, new chief of staff, a new 
20110105181028.000|20110105181030.000|TR0|economic adviser.  He's got a lot on his 
20110105181030.000|20110105181031.000|TR0|plate, as well.  Let's go up to Capitol 
20110105181031.000|20110105181033.000|TR0|Hill.  Dana Bash is standing by with a 
20110105181033.000|20110105181035.000|TR0|special guest -- Dana.

20110105181037.000|20110105181039.000|TR0|DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL 
20110105181039.000|20110105181041.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Wolf. Well, 
20110105181041.000|20110105181042.000|TR0|obviously, a lot of the focus on the House 
20110105181042.000|20110105181044.000|TR0|side.  Where I am, is on the Republicans, 
20110105181044.000|20110105181046.000|TR0|since they are taking back control of 
20110105181046.000|20110105181048.000|TR0|Congress, but, obviously, this is not a 
20110105181048.000|20110105181050.000|TR0|great day for Democrats.
20110105181050.000|20110105181051.000|TR0|
20110105181051.000|20110105181053.000|TR0|And I have with me a member of the House 
20110105181053.000|20110105181055.000|TR0|Democratic leadership, Rosa De Lauro of 
20110105181055.000|20110105181057.000|TR0|Connecticut.
20110105181057.000|20110105181059.000|TR0|
20110105181059.000|20110105181100.000|TR0|Thank you, very much, for joining us.  
20110105181100.000|20110105181102.000|TR0|Just if you could give me a sense, and 
20110105181102.000|20110105181104.000|TR0|give our viewers a sense of -- as I said, 
20110105181104.000|20110105181106.000|TR0|this is a bad day for Democrats.  You're 
20110105181106.000|20110105181108.000|TR0|losing control of the Congress that you 
20110105181108.000|20110105181110.000|TR0|just gained four years ago.
20110105181110.000|20110105181111.000|TR0|
20110105181111.000|20110105181113.000|TR0|REP. ROSA DE LAURO (D), CONNECTICUT:  
20110105181113.000|20110105181115.000|TR0|Well, it's never good to be in the 
20110105181115.000|20110105181117.000|TR0|minority, but you what need to do is focus 
20110105181117.000|20110105181119.000|TR0|on what the feature needs to be.  And the 
20110105181119.000|20110105181120.000|TR0|future -- our future needs to be creating 
20110105181120.000|20110105181122.000|TR0|jobs, getting this economy right, putting 
20110105181122.000|20110105181124.000|TR0|people back to work, making sure that 
20110105181124.000|20110105181126.000|TR0|people have an opportunity for the future. 
20110105181126.000|20110105181128.000|TR0| And that's where the focus will be.  And 
20110105181128.000|20110105181130.000|TR0|we, also, have to move to get the deficit 
20110105181130.000|20110105181131.000|TR0|down and to protect the middle class of 
20110105181131.000|20110105181133.000|TR0|this country.
20110105181133.000|20110105181135.000|TR0|
20110105181135.000|20110105181137.000|TR0|BASH:  Yesterday, I was at a press 
20110105181137.000|20110105181139.000|TR0|conference with Nancy Pelosi.  You were 
20110105181139.000|20110105181140.000|TR0|there.  And she said she had no regrets 
20110105181140.000|20110105181142.000|TR0|about the way the Democrats ran the House 
20110105181142.000|20110105181144.000|TR0|for the past four years.  But you're a 
20110105181144.000|20110105181146.000|TR0|self- described liberal.  It was clear in 
20110105181146.000|20110105181148.000|TR0|watching the voters and how they reacted 
20110105181148.000|20110105181150.000|TR0|-- how they voted, but they, perhaps, 
20110105181150.000|20110105181151.000|TR0|thought that the Congress, in particular, 
20110105181151.000|20110105181153.000|TR0|had gone too far to the left.  Do you have 
20110105181153.000|20110105181155.000|TR0|some blame (ph) for that?
20110105181155.000|20110105181157.000|TR0|
20110105181157.000|20110105181159.000|TR0|DE LAURO:  Well, I think that -- I have no 
20110105181159.000|20110105181200.000|TR0|regrets about what he did in the House of 
20110105181200.000|20110105181202.000|TR0|Representatives.  We passed legislation 
20110105181202.000|20110105181204.000|TR0|that would create jobs.  We passed 
20110105181204.000|20110105181206.000|TR0|legislation that, in fact, would create 
20110105181206.000|20110105181208.000|TR0|jobs. We passed record legislation in 
20110105181208.000|20110105181210.000|TR0|providing the people with the opportunity 
20110105181210.000|20110105181211.000|TR0|to send their children to school.  I 
20110105181211.000|20110105181213.000|TR0|think, the health care bill is 
20110105181213.000|20110105181215.000|TR0|transformative in people's lives, and, I 
20110105181215.000|20110105181217.000|TR0|think, quite frankly, that, you know, the 
20110105181217.000|20110105181219.000|TR0|Republicans said they were going to come 
20110105181219.000|20110105181220.000|TR0|here, focus like a laser on the economy, 
20110105181220.000|20110105181222.000|TR0|on deficit reduction, on protecting the 
20110105181222.000|20110105181224.000|TR0|middle class, but if you take a look, they 
20110105181224.000|20110105181226.000|TR0|change in a nanosecond.
20110105181226.000|20110105181228.000|TR0|
20110105181228.000|20110105181230.000|TR0|Repealing health care is not going to 
20110105181230.000|20110105181231.000|TR0|happen.  This is just political theatre.  
20110105181231.000|20110105181233.000|TR0|It helps to motivate their base.  So, 
20110105181233.000|20110105181235.000|TR0|that's what that is. In addition to it, 
20110105181235.000|20110105181237.000|TR0|repealing health care will add about $143 
20110105181237.000|20110105181239.000|TR0|billion to the deficit and create more 
20110105181239.000|20110105181240.000|TR0|unemployment.  They talked about $100 
20110105181240.000|20110105181242.000|TR0|billion in cuts.  That will create 
20110105181242.000|20110105181244.000|TR0|unemployment in education and in 
20110105181244.000|20110105181246.000|TR0|transportation.  And the deficit argument, 
20110105181246.000|20110105181248.000|TR0|it is, quite frankly, a joke.
20110105181248.000|20110105181249.000|TR0|
20110105181249.000|20110105181251.000|TR0|BASH:  Let me just ask you one more 
20110105181251.000|20110105181253.000|TR0|question before I let you go.  And that is 
20110105181253.000|20110105181255.000|TR0|a personal reflection.
20110105181255.000|20110105181257.000|TR0|
20110105181257.000|20110105181259.000|TR0|DE LAURO:  Yes.
20110105181259.000|20110105181300.000|TR0|
20110105181300.000|20110105181302.000|TR0|BASH:  Obviously, it was just four years 
20110105181302.000|20110105181304.000|TR0|ago that one of your very, very good 
20110105181304.000|20110105181306.000|TR0|friends, Nancy Pelosi, began the first 
20110105181306.000|20110105181308.000|TR0|keynote speaker of the House.  She says 
20110105181308.000|20110105181309.000|TR0|she doesn't look back, she doesn't 
20110105181309.000|20110105181311.000|TR0|reflect.  But, for you, as a fellow female 
20110105181311.000|20110105181313.000|TR0|member of Congress, how bitter sweet is it 
20110105181313.000|20110105181315.000|TR0|to see this woman give up the gavel?
20110105181315.000|20110105181317.000|TR0|
20110105181317.000|20110105181319.000|TR0|DE LAURO:  Well, I -- you know, I would 
20110105181319.000|20110105181320.000|TR0|like to see Nancy Pelosi remain speaker of 
20110105181320.000|20110105181322.000|TR0|the House.  That is not what's happened.  
20110105181322.000|20110105181324.000|TR0|The fact of the matter is that this is a 
20110105181324.000|20110105181326.000|TR0|body of deliberation where we can move 
20110105181326.000|20110105181328.000|TR0|forward.  The former has said, she is 
20110105181328.000|20110105181329.000|TR0|moving forward.  We are going to move the 
20110105181329.000|20110105181331.000|TR0|party in what we need to do, and what 
20110105181331.000|20110105181333.000|TR0|she's committed to do, is what is 
20110105181333.000|20110105181335.000|TR0|important for the future of this country.  
20110105181335.000|20110105181337.000|TR0|And that's a national economic growth 
20110105181337.000|20110105181339.000|TR0|strategy, putting people back to work, 
20110105181339.000|20110105181340.000|TR0|revitalizing our manufacturing base, 
20110105181340.000|20110105181342.000|TR0|dealing with education, and research, 
20110105181342.000|20110105181344.000|TR0|innovation, and infrastructure -- 
20110105181344.000|20110105181346.000|TR0|everything that the republican majority 
20110105181346.000|20110105181348.000|TR0|has now said that they want to cut.
20110105181348.000|20110105181349.000|TR0|
20110105181349.000|20110105181351.000|TR0|We are consumed with a -- creating jobs 
20110105181351.000|20110105181353.000|TR0|and creating an economic recovery for this 
20110105181353.000|20110105181355.000|TR0|nation.
20110105181355.000|20110105181357.000|TR0|
20110105181357.000|20110105181359.000|TR0|BASH:  Thank you very much for joining us, 
20110105181359.000|20110105181400.000|TR0|I appreciate it.
20110105181400.000|20110105181402.000|TR0|
20110105181402.000|20110105181404.000|TR0|LAURO:  Thank you.
20110105181404.000|20110105181406.000|TR0|
20110105181406.000|20110105181408.000|TR0|BASH:  And, Wolf, you heard right here, a 
20110105181408.000|20110105181409.000|TR0|member of the democratic leadership -- the 
20110105181409.000|20110105181411.000|TR0|pivot has happened.  The democrats are now 
20110105181411.000|20110105181413.000|TR0|in the house -- the opposition party.  And 
20110105181413.000|20110105181415.000|TR0|that is absolutely clear in their rhetoric 
20110105181415.000|20110105181417.000|TR0|towards the new republican majority.
20110105181417.000|20110105181419.000|TR0|
20110105181419.000|20110105181420.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Significant opposition.  And 
20110105181420.000|20110105181422.000|TR0|I'll restate the numbers again. In fact, 
20110105181422.000|20110105181424.000|TR0|in the new House of Representatives, 242 
20110105181424.000|20110105181426.000|TR0|republicans, 193 democrats.  The 
20110105181426.000|20110105181428.000|TR0|republicans gained 63 seats.  Just to 
20110105181428.000|20110105181429.000|TR0|underscore that, the freshmen, the 
20110105181429.000|20110105181431.000|TR0|incoming members of the House of 
20110105181431.000|20110105181433.000|TR0|Representatives -- there will be 96 
20110105181433.000|20110105181435.000|TR0|freshmen in the house of representatives.  
20110105181435.000|20110105181437.000|TR0|Of those 96, 87 -- 87 are republicans.  
20110105181437.000|20110105181438.000|TR0|Only nine new democrats.  Underscoring 
20110105181438.000|20110105181440.000|TR0|what the President of the United States 
20110105181440.000|20110105181442.000|TR0|called the "shellacking" that the 
20110105181442.000|20110105181444.000|TR0|democrats suffered back on November 2nd.
20110105181444.000|20110105181446.000|TR0|
20110105181446.000|20110105181448.000|TR0|There is real action going on on the 
20110105181448.000|20110105181449.000|TR0|Senate floor right now.  They're voting 
20110105181449.000|20110105181451.000|TR0|for the Speaker of the House on the house 
20110105181451.000|20110105181453.000|TR0|floor.  We all know what the results of 
20110105181453.000|20110105181455.000|TR0|that are going to be, but Harry Reid is 
20110105181455.000|20110105181457.000|TR0|now talking about a proposal by the 
20110105181457.000|20110105181458.000|TR0|democrats to sort of weaken the filibuster 
20110105181458.000|20110105181500.000|TR0|rules that have governed the Senate for 
20110105181500.000|20110105181502.000|TR0|some time.  This is some proposal that 
20110105181502.000|20110105181504.000|TR0|Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, the 
20110105181504.000|20110105181506.000|TR0|democrat from New Mexico, has put forward.
20110105181506.000|20110105181508.000|TR0|
20110105181508.000|20110105181509.000|TR0|I want to bring in our congressional 
20110105181509.000|20110105181511.000|TR0|correspondent, Brianna Keilar, to explain 
20110105181511.000|20110105181513.000|TR0|what the democrats are trying to do right 
20110105181513.000|20110105181515.000|TR0|now.
20110105181515.000|20110105181517.000|TR0|
20110105181517.000|20110105181518.000|TR0|Brianna? BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN 
20110105181518.000|20110105181520.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, as you know, one of 
20110105181520.000|20110105181522.000|TR0|the big tools of the minority in the 
20110105181522.000|20110105181524.000|TR0|Senate for republicans has been this 60- 
20110105181524.000|20110105181526.000|TR0|vote threshold that they can force the 
20110105181526.000|20110105181528.000|TR0|majority to come up with 60 votes to move 
20110105181528.000|20110105181529.000|TR0|legislation.  And now the reality is that 
20110105181529.000|20110105181531.000|TR0|the democrats see their minority 
20110105181531.000|20110105181533.000|TR0|diminished to 53 and it's just going to 
20110105181533.000|20110105181535.000|TR0|make it very difficult to hit that 60-vote 
20110105181535.000|20110105181537.000|TR0|threshold.
20110105181537.000|20110105181538.000|TR0|
20110105181538.000|20110105181540.000|TR0|So, what you have is this effort -- and 
20110105181540.000|20110105181542.000|TR0|it's being spearheaded by freshmen 
20110105181542.000|20110105181544.000|TR0|democrats like Senator Udall.  And they're 
20110105181544.000|20110105181546.000|TR0|putting in changes here on this first day 
20110105181546.000|20110105181548.000|TR0|of the senate, proposed changes, that 
20110105181548.000|20110105181549.000|TR0|would say you don't have to hit that 
20110105181549.000|20110105181551.000|TR0|60-vote threshold just to get a bill to 
20110105181551.000|20110105181553.000|TR0|the floor.  And also, it would end secret 
20110105181553.000|20110105181555.000|TR0|holds, where one senator can object on 
20110105181555.000|20110105181557.000|TR0|behalf of another senator who gets to 
20110105181557.000|20110105181558.000|TR0|remain anonymous.
20110105181558.000|20110105181600.000|TR0|
20110105181600.000|20110105181602.000|TR0|Also, if you want to filibuster something, 
20110105181602.000|20110105181604.000|TR0|you actually have to do that speaking 
20110105181604.000|20110105181606.000|TR0|filibuster, kind of the way Jimmy Stewart 
20110105181606.000|20110105181608.000|TR0|did in "Mr. Smith Comes to Washington".  
20110105181608.000|20110105181609.000|TR0|We know it doesn't happen that way anymore.
20110105181609.000|20110105181611.000|TR0|
20110105181611.000|20110105181613.000|TR0|The bottom line here, though, Wolf, is 
20110105181613.000|20110105181615.000|TR0|these are proposed changes. Negotiations 
20110105181615.000|20110105181617.000|TR0|are continuing between democrats and 
20110105181617.000|20110105181618.000|TR0|republicans on this. And certainly 
20110105181618.000|20110105181620.000|TR0|republicans are really loathe to give up 
20110105181620.000|20110105181622.000|TR0|any of their power.  As the minority, they 
20110105181622.000|20110105181624.000|TR0|don't really want to give up this tool 
20110105181624.000|20110105181626.000|TR0|that they have as the filibuster.  And you 
20110105181626.000|20110105181627.000|TR0|also have some senior democrats who say, 
20110105181627.000|20110105181629.000|TR0|"you know, we maybe don't want to do this 
20110105181629.000|20110105181631.000|TR0|because we could be in the minority again 
20110105181631.000|20110105181633.000|TR0|soon and we're going to want to have that 
20110105181633.000|20110105181635.000|TR0|tool as well."
20110105181635.000|20110105181637.000|TR0|
20110105181637.000|20110105181638.000|TR0|We're going to be seeing, possibly, a vote 
20110105181638.000|20110105181640.000|TR0|on January 24th.  This was introduced 
20110105181640.000|20110105181642.000|TR0|formally today.  There could be a vote on 
20110105181642.000|20110105181644.000|TR0|January 24th. There also could not be a 
20110105181644.000|20110105181646.000|TR0|vote.
20110105181646.000|20110105181647.000|TR0|
20110105181647.000|20110105181649.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes, Brianna, thanks very much 
20110105181649.000|20110105181651.000|TR0|for that.  Brianna on the hill.
20110105181651.000|20110105181653.000|TR0|
20110105181653.000|20110105181655.000|TR0|Donna Brazile, are you among those 
20110105181655.000|20110105181657.000|TR0|democrats who believe that this effort to 
20110105181657.000|20110105181658.000|TR0|weaken the filibuster, not do away with 
20110105181658.000|20110105181700.000|TR0|the filibuster, but to weaken it right now 
20110105181700.000|20110105181702.000|TR0|could backfire if the democrats suffer a 
20110105181702.000|20110105181704.000|TR0|real additional setback in two years or 
20110105181704.000|20110105181706.000|TR0|for years?  They might want to use all 
20110105181706.000|20110105181707.000|TR0|these techniques to stop the republicans, 
20110105181707.000|20110105181709.000|TR0|who potentially could have a huge majority 
20110105181709.000|20110105181711.000|TR0|in the house, from pushing through their 
20110105181711.000|20110105181713.000|TR0|agenda.
20110105181713.000|20110105181715.000|TR0|
20110105181715.000|20110105181717.000|TR0|DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL 
20110105181717.000|20110105181718.000|TR0|ADVISOR:  Wolf, I think that the Senate 
20110105181718.000|20110105181720.000|TR0|should adopt new rules the will allow the 
20110105181720.000|20110105181722.000|TR0|debate to proceed. Part of this package, 
20110105181722.000|20110105181724.000|TR0|which is only four pages, will still give 
20110105181724.000|20110105181726.000|TR0|41 members the ability to stop progress, 
20110105181726.000|20110105181727.000|TR0|but it will allow -- after they get up and 
20110105181727.000|20110105181729.000|TR0|state their objections and have their say 
20110105181729.000|20110105181731.000|TR0|-- it will allow the Senate to proceed 
20110105181731.000|20110105181733.000|TR0|with a vote on some of this crucial piece 
20110105181733.000|20110105181735.000|TR0|of legislation, so I do support 
20110105181735.000|20110105181737.000|TR0|modifications of the Senate rules.
20110105181737.000|20110105181738.000|TR0|
20110105181738.000|20110105181740.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Because I know, Gloria, based on 
20110105181740.000|20110105181742.000|TR0|conversations, there are some democrats 
20110105181742.000|20110105181744.000|TR0|that are saying "well, you know, maybe not 
20110105181744.000|20110105181746.000|TR0|so fast".
20110105181746.000|20110105181747.000|TR0|
20110105181747.000|20110105181749.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  You 
20110105181749.000|20110105181751.000|TR0|know, where you stand depends on where you 
20110105181751.000|20110105181753.000|TR0|sit and depends on who's in the majority 
20110105181753.000|20110105181755.000|TR0|and -- and look, so these democrats are 
20110105181755.000|20110105181757.000|TR0|saying "look, you know, wait a minute, we 
20110105181757.000|20110105181758.000|TR0|could be in the minority at some point and 
20110105181758.000|20110105181800.000|TR0|you're not going to like this".  But 
20110105181800.000|20110105181802.000|TR0|you've got to think about where congress 
20110105181802.000|20110105181804.000|TR0|is right now.  People don't like congress. 
20110105181804.000|20110105181806.000|TR0| They don't think congress gets anything 
20110105181806.000|20110105181807.000|TR0|done.
20110105181807.000|20110105181809.000|TR0|
20110105181809.000|20110105181811.000|TR0|One of the reasons congress doesn't get 
20110105181811.000|20110105181813.000|TR0|anything done is because in the Senate, 
20110105181813.000|20110105181815.000|TR0|you rarely ever get to a debate if there's 
20110105181815.000|20110105181816.000|TR0|a difference between the parties on it 
20110105181816.000|20110105181818.000|TR0|unless you have a huge majority of one 
20110105181818.000|20110105181820.000|TR0|party or another.  So, 60 votes is tough 
20110105181820.000|20110105181822.000|TR0|and you want to at least be able to 
20110105181822.000|20110105181824.000|TR0|proceed to a debate on something and the 
20110105181824.000|20110105181826.000|TR0|secret holds are also sort of an 
20110105181826.000|20110105181827.000|TR0|anachronistic at this point.  Why should 
20110105181827.000|20110105181829.000|TR0|somebody be able to hold something 
20110105181829.000|20110105181831.000|TR0|secretly?  That's, you know -- if you want 
20110105181831.000|20110105181833.000|TR0|to talk about letting the public in to the 
20110105181833.000|20110105181835.000|TR0|way the Senate operates and having 
20110105181835.000|20110105181836.000|TR0|transparency -- secret holds are probably 
20110105181836.000|20110105181838.000|TR0|not a great idea.

20110105181840.000|20110105181842.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Reminds me of the song from 
20110105181842.000|20110105181844.000|TR0|"Fiddler on the Roof" -- "Tradition".  
20110105181844.000|20110105181846.000|TR0|That's the tradition in the Senate.  Right?
20110105181846.000|20110105181847.000|TR0|
20110105181847.000|20110105181849.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, be careful 
20110105181849.000|20110105181851.000|TR0|what you wish for.  I mean, you know, 
20110105181851.000|20110105181853.000|TR0|here's the problem -- it's always been 
20110105181853.000|20110105181855.000|TR0|majority rules - minority rights.  One of 
20110105181855.000|20110105181856.000|TR0|the biggest minority rights has been the 
20110105181856.000|20110105181858.000|TR0|filibuster. Yes, Congress rating is very 
20110105181858.000|20110105181900.000|TR0|low.  It's traditionally, historically 
20110105181900.000|20110105181902.000|TR0|been really low and sometimes it even gets 
20110105181902.000|20110105181904.000|TR0|lower when they pass something people 
20110105181904.000|20110105181906.000|TR0|don't like.  So, you know, making the 
20110105181906.000|20110105181907.000|TR0|senate more active may not be something 
20110105181907.000|20110105181909.000|TR0|that wins them a lot of accolades 
20110105181909.000|20110105181911.000|TR0|depending on what they do.

20110105181913.000|20110105181915.000|TR0|I'm not arguing that they should or 
20110105181915.000|20110105181916.000|TR0|shouldn't do it, I'm just saying that 
20110105181916.000|20110105181918.000|TR0|there's another side to this and when the 
20110105181918.000|20110105181920.000|TR0|minority does begin to lose any way of 
20110105181920.000|20110105181922.000|TR0|sort of slowing down legislation, then you 
20110105181922.000|20110105181924.000|TR0|do have the, you know, unintended 
20110105181924.000|20110105181926.000|TR0|consequences rule that begins to set in 
20110105181926.000|20110105181927.000|TR0|when you pass something really quickly.

20110105181946.000|20110105181947.000|TR0|the last few years with the republicans 
20110105181947.000|20110105181949.000|TR0|putting up all kinds of obstruction.  But 
20110105181949.000|20110105181951.000|TR0|even Chief Justice Roberts complained

20110105182031.000|20110105182033.000|TR0|things to do, things to do.  Well, you 
20110105182033.000|20110105182035.000|TR0|know, first of all, they have to get their 
20110105182035.000|20110105182036.000|TR0|act together and there are these rule 
20110105182036.000|20110105182038.000|TR0|changes that they can only make on a 
20110105182038.000|20110105182040.000|TR0|single day.  What I was surprised to 
20110105182040.000|20110105182042.000|TR0|learn, and I covered the senate for a very 
20110105182042.000|20110105182044.000|TR0|long time, that they can hold the first

20110105182113.000|20110105182115.000|TR0|That is according to the vote count going 
20110105182115.000|20110105182116.000|TR0|on right now. The election for the Speaker 
20110105182116.000|20110105182118.000|TR0|is happening, and he crossed the threshold 
20110105182118.000|20110105182120.000|TR0|in the number of votes that he needs to 
20110105182120.000|20110105182122.000|TR0|become Speaker. That is 218 members of the

20110105182245.000|20110105182247.000|TR0|interesting also, Dana, is that Nancy 
20110105182247.000|20110105182249.000|TR0|Pelosi did not get all the democrats' 
20110105182249.000|20110105182251.000|TR0|votes.  Some of those so-called "blue 
20110105182251.000|20110105182253.000|TR0|dogs" or moderate democrats did not vote 
20110105182253.000|20110105182254.000|TR0|for her, they voted for Heath Shuler -- 
20110105182254.000|20110105182256.000|TR0|one of their own -- the democratic

20110105182258.000|20110105182300.000|TR0|That's right, and that is what we 
20110105182300.000|20110105182302.000|TR0|expected, Wolf, from the very beginning 
20110105182302.000|20110105182304.000|TR0|when Nancy Pelosi made it clear -- in a 
20110105182304.000|20110105182305.000|TR0|surprise move to many of her colleagues -- 
20110105182305.000|20110105182307.000|TR0|that she was not going to step aside after 
20110105182307.000|20110105182309.000|TR0|she lost the Speaker's Gavel in the 
20110105182309.000|20110105182311.000|TR0|election and she was going to run for the 
20110105182311.000|20110105182313.000|TR0|House Minority Leader.  People were not 
20110105182313.000|20110105182314.000|TR0|happy.  Some of the more conservatives, as 
20110105182314.000|20110105182316.000|TR0|you said.  So they made very clear to us, 
20110105182316.000|20110105182318.000|TR0|many of them, that they were not going to 
20110105182318.000|20110105182320.000|TR0|vote for her for Speaker -- excuse me -- 
20110105182320.000|20110105182322.000|TR0|for Minority Leader or Speaker.  That they 
20110105182322.000|20110105182324.000|TR0|wanted somebody else just to make a point 
20110105182324.000|20110105182325.000|TR0|symbolically that they didn't think that 
20110105182325.000|20110105182327.000|TR0|she should still be the democratic leader.
20110105182327.000|20110105182329.000|TR0|
20110105182329.000|20110105182331.000|TR0|But, look, the big story, obviously, as 
20110105182331.000|20110105182333.000|TR0|you've been mentioning, is John Boehner.  
20110105182333.000|20110105182334.000|TR0|We reported a little while ago that his 
20110105182334.000|20110105182336.000|TR0|colleagues have now officially elected him 
20110105182336.000|20110105182338.000|TR0|to be the Speaker.  He is somebody who we 
20110105182338.000|20110105182340.000|TR0|have watched for years, Wolf.  He has been 
20110105182340.000|20110105182342.000|TR0|in Congress for 20 years. He actually came 
20110105182342.000|20110105182343.000|TR0|here back in 1991 as kind of one of the 
20110105182343.000|20110105182345.000|TR0|rabble rousers, not that different from 
20110105182345.000|20110105182347.000|TR0|the new republicans that we see now.
20110105182347.000|20110105182349.000|TR0|
20110105182349.000|20110105182351.000|TR0|He rose to power as part of the early 
20110105182351.000|20110105182353.000|TR0|leadership in the republican revolution 
20110105182353.000|20110105182354.000|TR0|back in 1994, but he fell out of favor and 
20110105182354.000|20110105182356.000|TR0|kind of was pushed aside.  But, also 
20110105182356.000|20110105182358.000|TR0|interesting, at that time, Wolf, he became 
20110105182358.000|20110105182400.000|TR0|the chairman of the education committee.  
20110105182400.000|20110105182402.000|TR0|He actually worked very closely with 
20110105182402.000|20110105182403.000|TR0|democrats.  He helped to get President 
20110105182403.000|20110105182405.000|TR0|Bush's "No Child Left Behind" through, so 
20110105182405.000|20110105182407.000|TR0|very interesting.
20110105182407.000|20110105182409.000|TR0|
20110105182409.000|20110105182411.000|TR0|And also, just in terms of the person, I 
20110105182411.000|20110105182413.000|TR0|think we have a photograph of John 
20110105182413.000|20110105182414.000|TR0|Boehner.  Look at this photograph.  All of 
20110105182414.000|20110105182416.000|TR0|his siblings.  He is one of 12.  And this 
20110105182416.000|20110105182418.000|TR0|is something that he plays up in a big way 
20110105182418.000|20110105182420.000|TR0|-- the fact that he comes from a big 
20110105182420.000|20110105182422.000|TR0|family, that he comes from a blue collar 
20110105182422.000|20110105182423.000|TR0|family, that he knows what it's like, as 
20110105182423.000|20110105182425.000|TR0|he says many times, to sweep the floors.  
20110105182425.000|20110105182427.000|TR0|He started his own business.  And the fact 
20110105182427.000|20110105182429.000|TR0|that he is somebody who comes from this 
20110105182429.000|20110105182431.000|TR0|big blue collar family -- a Catholic 
20110105182431.000|20110105182433.000|TR0|family -- he says really feeds into his 
20110105182433.000|20110105182434.000|TR0|sensibilities here, but it really is a 
20110105182434.000|20110105182436.000|TR0|dual sensibility because he is somebody 
20110105182436.000|20110105182438.000|TR0|also very well- known, as you know, Wolf.
20110105182438.000|20110105182440.000|TR0|
20110105182440.000|20110105182442.000|TR0|He is very close with business -- makes no 
20110105182442.000|20110105182443.000|TR0|apologies for being friends with 
20110105182443.000|20110105182445.000|TR0|lobbyists, and that is a dichotomy.  
20110105182445.000|20110105182447.000|TR0|Especially given the fact that he is now 
20110105182447.000|20110105182449.000|TR0|going to lead the Republican Congress and 
20110105182449.000|20110105182451.000|TR0|many of them have said that they want to 
20110105182451.000|20110105182453.000|TR0|do things differently.
20110105182453.000|20110105182454.000|TR0|
20110105182454.000|20110105182456.000|TR0|BLITZER:  This is -- these are pictures of 
20110105182456.000|20110105182458.000|TR0|him walking to the house floor just a 
20110105182458.000|20110105182500.000|TR0|little while ago, about an hour or so ago, 
20110105182500.000|20110105182502.000|TR0|Dana.  You're standing right there, you 
20110105182502.000|20110105182503.000|TR0|tried to cajole him into coming over to 
20110105182503.000|20110105182505.000|TR0|your microphone.  He smiled a little bit, 
20110105182505.000|20110105182507.000|TR0|not much, but he kept on walking, which is 
20110105182507.000|20110105182509.000|TR0|not a huge surprise.
20110105182509.000|20110105182511.000|TR0|
20110105182511.000|20110105182513.000|TR0|Alright, let's go to Cincinnati right now. 
20110105182513.000|20110105182514.000|TR0| CNN's Mark Preston is standing by over at 
20110105182514.000|20110105182516.000|TR0|"Andy's Cafe".  This is a cafe, a bar, 
20110105182516.000|20110105182518.000|TR0|that started way back in 1938 by John 
20110105182518.000|20110105182520.000|TR0|Boehner's grandfather.  He grew up around 
20110105182520.000|20110105182522.000|TR0|that bar.  He and his 11 brothers and 
20110105182522.000|20110105182523.000|TR0|sisters.  Tell us what's going on.  There 
20110105182523.000|20110105182525.000|TR0|must be a lot of excited people over 
20110105182525.000|20110105182527.000|TR0|there, Mark.

20110105182529.000|20110105182531.000|TR0|MARK PRESTON, CNN POLITICAL EDITOR:  Wolf, 
20110105182531.000|20110105182532.000|TR0|when you talk about the American Dream, 
20110105182532.000|20110105182534.000|TR0|this is where it happened for John Boehner 
20110105182534.000|20110105182536.000|TR0|-- here at Andy's Cafe.  His grandfather 
20110105182536.000|20110105182538.000|TR0|started the bar in 1938, as you said. His 
20110105182538.000|20110105182540.000|TR0|father ran it, John Boehner came in here 
20110105182540.000|20110105182542.000|TR0|as a young boy, 10, 12. He was mopping 
20110105182542.000|20110105182543.000|TR0|these floors.  As he got older he tended 
20110105182543.000|20110105182545.000|TR0|bar.  He ended up going on, became a 
20110105182545.000|20110105182547.000|TR0|janitor, went to school for seven years.  
20110105182547.000|20110105182549.000|TR0|I'll tell you what, talk about (AUDIO GAP) 
20110105182549.000|20110105182551.000|TR0|here, Wolf.  This is where some people say 
20110105182551.000|20110105182552.000|TR0|"what are Midwestern values?"  Well, a lot 
20110105182552.000|20110105182554.000|TR0|of people here know what John Boehner is 
20110105182554.000|20110105182556.000|TR0|all about, including this young lady who 
20110105182556.000|20110105182558.000|TR0|has known him for more than 50 years.

20110105182625.000|20110105182627.000|TR0|think John Boehner might have gained here, 
20110105182627.000|20110105182629.000|TR0|where he grew up in northern Cincinnati, 
20110105182629.000|20110105182631.000|TR0|that might help him as Speaker of the

20110105182638.000|20110105182640.000|TR0|good as the big guy, you know?  That's all 
20110105182640.000|20110105182642.000|TR0|I can say.  I mean, they're just family.

20110105182741.000|20110105182743.000|TR0|BLITZER:  The U.S. Capitol.  This is a big 
20110105182743.000|20110105182745.000|TR0|day up on Capitol Hill, here in 
20110105182745.000|20110105182747.000|TR0|Washington.  Right now, there's a new 
20110105182747.000|20110105182749.000|TR0|House, a new Senate, they're all being 
20110105182749.000|20110105182751.000|TR0|sworn in.  There's going to be a new 
20110105182751.000|20110105182752.000|TR0|speaker, John Boehner has just been 
20110105182752.000|20110105182754.000|TR0|elected.  He'll be formally sworn in, I 
20110105182754.000|20110105182756.000|TR0|guess, within the hour or so up in a 
20110105182756.000|20110105182758.000|TR0|ceremony on Capitol Hill, and become the 
20110105182758.000|20110105182800.000|TR0|next Speaker of the House of 
20110105182800.000|20110105182801.000|TR0|Representatives.

20110105182803.000|20110105182805.000|TR0|In the Senate, they've got some real 
20110105182805.000|20110105182807.000|TR0|business underway.  The Democrats are 
20110105182807.000|20110105182809.000|TR0|trying to weaken some of the arcane rules 
20110105182809.000|20110105182811.000|TR0|involving filibusters. We'll see how far 
20110105182811.000|20110105182812.000|TR0|that gets on this, the first day of the 
20110105182812.000|20110105182814.000|TR0|112th Congress.

20110105182820.000|20110105182821.000|TR0|in with CNN's Fredricka Whitfield.  She's 
20110105182821.000|20110105182823.000|TR0|got some of the headlines for us.

20110105182834.000|20110105182836.000|TR0|A lot,   beginning with police 
20110105182836.000|20110105182838.000|TR0|investigating the death of former Pentagon 
20110105182838.000|20110105182840.000|TR0|official John Wheeler.  They have found 
20110105182840.000|20110105182841.000|TR0|his car in a Wilmington, Delaware parking 
20110105182841.000|20110105182843.000|TR0|garage.  Wheeler reportedly stumbled into 
20110105182843.000|20110105182845.000|TR0|a different garage two days before his 
20110105182845.000|20110105182847.000|TR0|body was found at a landfill.

20110105182900.000|20110105182901.000|TR0|He didn't have a coat on and what really 
20110105182901.000|20110105182903.000|TR0|striked (sic) me -- he didn't have a coat 
20110105182903.000|20110105182905.000|TR0|on and he didn't have his shoes.  Then 
20110105182905.000|20110105182907.000|TR0|when I asked him where was his parking 
20110105182907.000|20110105182909.000|TR0|ticket at when we were at my garage, he 
20110105182909.000|20110105182910.000|TR0|said he couldn't find it.  It was inside 
20110105182910.000|20110105182912.000|TR0|of his briefcase.  So when I asked him 
20110105182912.000|20110105182914.000|TR0|where was his briefcase, he said his 
20110105182914.000|20110105182916.000|TR0|briefcase was stolen.

20110105182927.000|20110105182929.000|TR0|Actress Glenn Close says she is distraught 
20110105182929.000|20110105182930.000|TR0|to find out her image briefly appears in 
20110105182930.000|20110105182932.000|TR0|vulgar videos shown aboard the Navy 
20110105182932.000|20110105182934.000|TR0|aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise.  Close 
20110105182934.000|20110105182936.000|TR0|calls the use of her image insulting and 
20110105182936.000|20110105182938.000|TR0|deeply offensive, explaining that she 
20110105182938.000|20110105182940.000|TR0|visited the Enterprise several years ago.  
20110105182940.000|20110105182941.000|TR0|Captain Owen Honors has been relieved of

20110105182954.000|20110105182956.000|TR0|month.  In a statement today, the 
20110105182956.000|20110105182958.000|TR0|president called Gibbs a close friend and 
20110105182958.000|20110105183000.000|TR0|one of my closest advisors. Gibbs plans to 
20110105183000.000|20110105183001.000|TR0|become a pundit, supporting White House 
20110105183001.000|20110105183003.000|TR0|positions on television and in speeches.

20110105183014.000|20110105183016.000|TR0|better showing than expected.  That figure 
20110105183016.000|20110105183018.000|TR0|is triple the November number, however,

20110105183027.000|20110105183029.000|TR0|in Idaho and Washington State.  And the

20110105183030.000|20110105183032.000|TR0|split the second largest jackpot in U.S.

20110105183218.000|20110105183219.000|TR0|There are 242 Republicans in this new 
20110105183219.000|20110105183221.000|TR0|Congress.  I wonder who that one 
20110105183221.000|20110105183223.000|TR0|Republican who either was not voting, not 
20110105183223.000|20110105183225.000|TR0|present or voted for somebody else might 
20110105183225.000|20110105183227.000|TR0|be, but we'll find out at some point down 
20110105183227.000|20110105183229.000|TR0|the road.  We'll check that.  The 241 is 
20110105183229.000|20110105183230.000|TR0|more than the 218 needed for the majority.
20110105183230.000|20110105183232.000|TR0|
20110105183232.000|20110105183234.000|TR0|There's Nancy Pelosi, you just saw her in 
20110105183234.000|20110105183236.000|TR0|the blue dress.  She did not get 
20110105183236.000|20110105183238.000|TR0|re-elected as speaker of the house, for 
20110105183238.000|20110105183239.000|TR0|obvious reasons, given the fact that there 
20110105183239.000|20110105183241.000|TR0|are only 193 Democrats in this, the new 
20110105183241.000|20110105183243.000|TR0|House of Representatives.  You saw there 
20110105183243.000|20110105183245.000|TR0|were a bunch of Democrats who didn't vote 
20110105183245.000|20110105183247.000|TR0|for her for the minority leader position, 
20110105183247.000|20110105183248.000|TR0|in effect.  They voted for others, 
20110105183248.000|20110105183250.000|TR0|including Heath Shuler, the so-called blue 
20110105183250.000|20110105183252.000|TR0|dog conservative Democrat from North 
20110105183252.000|20110105183254.000|TR0|Carolina.
20110105183254.000|20110105183256.000|TR0|
20110105183256.000|20110105183258.000|TR0|There you see members of the Boehner 
20110105183258.000|20110105183259.000|TR0|family there.  His wife, they're 
20110105183259.000|20110105183301.000|TR0|celebrating the election of John Boehner 
20110105183301.000|20110105183303.000|TR0|to become the Speaker of the House of 
20110105183303.000|20110105183305.000|TR0|Representatives.  An historic day indeed.
20110105183305.000|20110105183307.000|TR0|
20110105183307.000|20110105183308.000|TR0|Candy Crowley is here watching all of 
20110105183308.000|20110105183310.000|TR0|this, someone who's covered Capitol Hill 
20110105183310.000|20110105183312.000|TR0|for a long time.  Let's just get a little 
20110105183312.000|20110105183314.000|TR0|perspective, Candy, on John Boehner -- You 
20110105183314.000|20110105183316.000|TR0|know this man quite well -- and what he 
20110105183316.000|20110105183318.000|TR0|means as the next speaker.
20110105183318.000|20110105183319.000|TR0|
20110105183319.000|20110105183321.000|TR0|CANDY CROWLEY, CNN HOST, "STATE OF THE 
20110105183321.000|20110105183323.000|TR0|UNION":  Well, I don't think speakers are 
20110105183323.000|20110105183325.000|TR0|formed until the speaker's job is 
20110105183325.000|20110105183327.000|TR0|presented to them.  I mean, John Boehner 
20110105183327.000|20110105183328.000|TR0|is a very methodical, precise -- and we 
20110105183328.000|20110105183330.000|TR0|were talking earlier -- you know, a guy 
20110105183330.000|20110105183332.000|TR0|that kind of -- to me, defies the 
20110105183332.000|20110105183334.000|TR0|stereotype that we see of him.  That he is 
20110105183334.000|20110105183336.000|TR0|some, you know, mean spirited kind of 
20110105183336.000|20110105183338.000|TR0|Republican that's just going to charge 
20110105183338.000|20110105183339.000|TR0|right down the right of the party.  He's 
20110105183339.000|20110105183341.000|TR0|not.  He has, in fact, contributed to a 
20110105183341.000|20110105183343.000|TR0|number of issues and voted for a number of 
20110105183343.000|20110105183345.000|TR0|issues and worked with liberals along the 
20110105183345.000|20110105183347.000|TR0|way.  Donna had some more detailed 
20110105183347.000|20110105183348.000|TR0|information about things he's done for 
20110105183348.000|20110105183350.000|TR0|education.
20110105183350.000|20110105183352.000|TR0|
20110105183352.000|20110105183354.000|TR0|I think what we're going to see, though, 
20110105183354.000|20110105183356.000|TR0|is a January speaker and then we're going 
20110105183356.000|20110105183358.000|TR0|to see a February speaker.  I think the 
20110105183358.000|20110105183359.000|TR0|January speaker that you're going to see 
20110105183359.000|20110105183401.000|TR0|is the guy that's going to push through a 
20110105183401.000|20110105183403.000|TR0|repeal of health care reform, that's going 
20110105183403.000|20110105183405.000|TR0|to start trying to toss out some of these 
20110105183405.000|20110105183407.000|TR0|regulations, do a lot of spending cuts 
20110105183407.000|20110105183408.000|TR0|because the Senate won't be around.  None 
20110105183408.000|20110105183410.000|TR0|of it's going to pass the Senate.  So it's 
20110105183410.000|20110105183412.000|TR0|a good time to go to the base.
20110105183412.000|20110105183414.000|TR0|
20110105183414.000|20110105183416.000|TR0|And then there's going to be the February 
20110105183416.000|20110105183418.000|TR0|speaker that's going to have to figure out 
20110105183418.000|20110105183419.000|TR0|how to get something done because he 
20110105183419.000|20110105183421.000|TR0|understands that the American people also 
20110105183421.000|20110105183423.000|TR0|voted out Democrats because it didn't look 
20110105183423.000|20110105183425.000|TR0|like either, A, the right things were 
20110105183425.000|20110105183427.000|TR0|getting done.  But mostly, B, nothing was 
20110105183427.000|20110105183428.000|TR0|getting done.
20110105183428.000|20110105183430.000|TR0|
20110105183430.000|20110105183432.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110105183432.000|20110105183434.000|TR0|ANALYST:  You know, Wolf, this is a man 
20110105183434.000|20110105183436.000|TR0|who was ousted from the Republican 
20110105183436.000|20110105183437.000|TR0|leadership 12 years ago.  And you have to 
20110105183437.000|20110105183439.000|TR0|give him so much credit.
20110105183439.000|20110105183441.000|TR0|
20110105183441.000|20110105183443.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  Tenacious.
20110105183443.000|20110105183445.000|TR0|
20110105183445.000|20110105183447.000|TR0|BORGER:  Tenacious, sticking with it.  
20110105183447.000|20110105183448.000|TR0|Coming back.  Also, being one of those 
20110105183448.000|20110105183450.000|TR0|leaders in the Congress to pay attention 
20110105183450.000|20110105183452.000|TR0|to the Tea Party early on and to say, you 
20110105183452.000|20110105183454.000|TR0|know what, we need to listen to what these 
20110105183454.000|20110105183456.000|TR0|people are saying.  His biggest problem is 
20110105183456.000|20110105183457.000|TR0|going to be managing the expectations of 
20110105183457.000|20110105183459.000|TR0|those Tea Party voters who may say OK, 
20110105183459.000|20110105183501.000|TR0|folks, we control the House now.  Let's 
20110105183501.000|20110105183503.000|TR0|get everything done that we want to get 
20110105183503.000|20110105183505.000|TR0|done except he understands the limits of a 
20110105183505.000|20110105183507.000|TR0|divided government.
20110105183507.000|20110105183508.000|TR0|
20110105183508.000|20110105183510.000|TR0|BLITZER:  A small group of members have 
20110105183510.000|20110105183512.000|TR0|just left the House floor to get John 
20110105183512.000|20110105183514.000|TR0|Boehner and to escort the Speaker-elect to 
20110105183514.000|20110105183516.000|TR0|the floor.  He'll be coming in fairly 
20110105183516.000|20110105183517.000|TR0|soon. There will be remarks from Nancy 
20110105183517.000|20110105183519.000|TR0|Pelosi and certainly from John Boehner, 
20110105183519.000|20110105183521.000|TR0|himself, the formal swearing in ceremony. 
20110105183521.000|20110105183523.000|TR0|That is coming up.
20110105183523.000|20110105183525.000|TR0|
20110105183525.000|20110105183527.000|TR0|Our own John King is up on Capitol Hill 
20110105183527.000|20110105183528.000|TR0|watching all of this unfold.
20110105183528.000|20110105183530.000|TR0|
20110105183530.000|20110105183532.000|TR0|Most of our viewers, dare I say, John, 
20110105183532.000|20110105183534.000|TR0|they don't know much about John Boehner, 
20110105183534.000|20110105183536.000|TR0|but they will in the coming weeks and 
20110105183536.000|20110105183537.000|TR0|months.
20110105183537.000|20110105183539.000|TR0|
20110105183539.000|20110105183541.000|TR0|JOHN KING, CNN HOST, "JOHN KING USA":  He 
20110105183541.000|20110105183543.000|TR0|is now, Wolf, one of the most powerful men 
20110105183543.000|20110105183545.000|TR0|in the United States of America.  He is 
20110105183545.000|20110105183547.000|TR0|second in line to the presidency after 
20110105183547.000|20110105183548.000|TR0|just the vice president.  That is the role 
20110105183548.000|20110105183550.000|TR0|the Speaker of the House fills.  He is 
20110105183550.000|20110105183552.000|TR0|now, as Gloria and Candy just noted, the 
20110105183552.000|20110105183554.000|TR0|leader of a somewhat restless Republicans 
20110105183554.000|20110105183556.000|TR0|majority. Managing that majority is his 
20110105183556.000|20110105183557.000|TR0|primary, number one challenge.
20110105183557.000|20110105183559.000|TR0|
20110105183559.000|20110105183601.000|TR0|And as we watch and we see this moment, 
20110105183601.000|20110105183603.000|TR0|this historic moment of John Boehner 
20110105183603.000|20110105183605.000|TR0|becoming the Speaker of the house, we know 
20110105183605.000|20110105183607.000|TR0|Republicans have gained some seats in the 
20110105183607.000|20110105183608.000|TR0|Senate, as well.  And we will have a new 
20110105183608.000|20110105183610.000|TR0|speaker of the House; a Republican, the 
20110105183610.000|20110105183612.000|TR0|same Minority Republican Leader in the 
20110105183612.000|20110105183614.000|TR0|Senate; Mitch McConnell.  And an 
20110105183614.000|20110105183616.000|TR0|interesting reset moment here in 
20110105183616.000|20110105183617.000|TR0|Washington.
20110105183617.000|20110105183619.000|TR0|
20110105183619.000|20110105183621.000|TR0|Neither one of those men has a very deep, 
20110105183621.000|20110105183623.000|TR0|a very good, a very trustworthy 
20110105183623.000|20110105183625.000|TR0|relationship with the Democratic President 
20110105183625.000|20110105183626.000|TR0|of the United States Barack Obama.  They 
20110105183626.000|20110105183628.000|TR0|have had more contact since the election, 
20110105183628.000|20110105183630.000|TR0|since the Republican shellacking, as the 
20110105183630.000|20110105183632.000|TR0|President calls it, than they had in the 
20110105183632.000|20110105183634.000|TR0|previous two years.  And the challenge now 
20110105183634.000|20110105183636.000|TR0|for all of these men, as Speaker Boehner 
20110105183636.000|20110105183637.000|TR0|tries to manage his new Tea Party energy, 
20110105183637.000|20110105183639.000|TR0|all the energy in the House side as Mitch 
20110105183639.000|20110105183641.000|TR0|McConnell essentially has veto power in 
20110105183641.000|20110105183643.000|TR0|the Senate, as the president, as he said 
20110105183643.000|20110105183645.000|TR0|on the flight back from Hawaii, tries to 
20110105183645.000|20110105183646.000|TR0|have a productive 2011 before going into 
20110105183646.000|20110105183648.000|TR0|the reelection year of 2012.
20110105183648.000|20110105183650.000|TR0|
20110105183650.000|20110105183652.000|TR0|Can they develop a relationship of trust?  
20110105183652.000|20110105183654.000|TR0|They're not going to agree on a lot of 
20110105183654.000|20110105183656.000|TR0|things, but can they negotiate?  Can they 
20110105183656.000|20110105183657.000|TR0|trust each other?  Can they cut some deals 
20110105183657.000|20110105183659.000|TR0|on the spending, the deficit, the other 
20110105183659.000|20110105183701.000|TR0|challenges facing the country?  As Candy 
20110105183701.000|20110105183703.000|TR0|noted, January will be about playing to 
20110105183703.000|20110105183705.000|TR0|the base.  When we talk about these things 
20110105183705.000|20110105183706.000|TR0|a month from now and six weeks from now, 
20110105183706.000|20110105183708.000|TR0|we will have a better sense of what the 
20110105183708.000|20110105183710.000|TR0|American people -- it's a great political 
20110105183710.000|20110105183712.000|TR0|moment  today, it's a lot of theater 
20110105183712.000|20110105183714.000|TR0|today.  What will the American people get 
20110105183714.000|20110105183716.000|TR0|out of this? We'll know more a little bit 
20110105183716.000|20110105183717.000|TR0|down the road.
20110105183717.000|20110105183719.000|TR0|
20110105183719.000|20110105183721.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Fascinating stuff.  And, you 
20110105183721.000|20110105183723.000|TR0|know, one of the most, I find thrilling 
20110105183723.000|20110105183725.000|TR0|moments of any House/Senate, joint 
20110105183725.000|20110105183726.000|TR0|session, this is just the House of 
20110105183726.000|20110105183728.000|TR0|Representatives.  When the Sergeant of 
20110105183728.000|20110105183730.000|TR0|Arms -- in this particular case Bill 
20110105183730.000|20110105183732.000|TR0|Livingood -- will announce the 
20110105183732.000|20110105183734.000|TR0|speaker-elect from the rear of the 
20110105183734.000|20110105183736.000|TR0|chamber.  That's about to happen.
20110105183736.000|20110105183737.000|TR0|
20110105183737.000|20110105183739.000|TR0|Dana Bash is just outside the House floor.
20110105183739.000|20110105183741.000|TR0|
20110105183741.000|20110105183743.000|TR0|I take it what happens next, Dana, is that 
20110105183743.000|20110105183745.000|TR0|the speaker-elect will be escorted in and 
20110105183745.000|20110105183746.000|TR0|he'll actually be introduced by Nancy 
20110105183746.000|20110105183748.000|TR0|Pelosi, the outgoing speaker.  She will 
20110105183748.000|20110105183750.000|TR0|introduce the incoming speaker.
20110105183750.000|20110105183752.000|TR0|
20110105183752.000|20110105183754.000|TR0|DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL 
20110105183754.000|20110105183756.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  It is going to be one of 
20110105183756.000|20110105183757.000|TR0|those moments -- you're exactly right -- 
20110105183757.000|20110105183759.000|TR0|that is how it's going to take place.  The 
20110105183759.000|20110105183801.000|TR0|reverse order of what we saw in terms of 
20110105183801.000|20110105183803.000|TR0|the two of them standing next to each 
20110105183803.000|20110105183805.000|TR0|other four years ago.
20110105183805.000|20110105183806.000|TR0|
20110105183806.000|20110105183808.000|TR0|She is going to introduce, she is going to 
20110105183808.000|20110105183810.000|TR0|make brief remarks.  And then he is also 
20110105183810.000|20110105183812.000|TR0|going to be sworn in by somebody who is a 
20110105183812.000|20110105183814.000|TR0|very prominent, powerful -- historically 
20110105183814.000|20110105183815.000|TR0|powerful figure in this body revered by 
20110105183815.000|20110105183817.000|TR0|the Democrats -- and that is John Dingle.  
20110105183817.000|20110105183819.000|TR0|He's known as the Dean of the House.  He's 
20110105183819.000|20110105183821.000|TR0|been here the longest of anybody, ever. 
20110105183821.000|20110105183823.000|TR0|And so he is going to administer the oath 
20110105183823.000|20110105183825.000|TR0|to John Boehner.
20110105183825.000|20110105183826.000|TR0|
20110105183826.000|20110105183828.000|TR0|I got to tell you, one thing that 
20110105183828.000|20110105183830.000|TR0|everybody is going to be looking for is 
20110105183830.000|20110105183832.000|TR0|John Boehner and how he is going to react 
20110105183832.000|20110105183834.000|TR0|as we walks down, as he stands up there, 
20110105183834.000|20110105183835.000|TR0|as he takes the gavel.  Our Deirdre Walter 
20110105183835.000|20110105183837.000|TR0|(ph), our congressional producer, is in 
20110105183837.000|20110105183839.000|TR0|the chamber and she already has said that 
20110105183839.000|20110105183841.000|TR0|when he first walked in, she saw him start 
20110105183841.000|20110105183843.000|TR0|to tear up.  It will not be a surprise if 
20110105183843.000|20110105183845.000|TR0|he does that again.  You know, he's gotten 
20110105183845.000|20110105183846.000|TR0|a lot of -- made a lot of headlines for 
20110105183846.000|20110105183848.000|TR0|crying in an interview, crying the night 
20110105183848.000|20110105183850.000|TR0|that he won the election.  Those of us who 
20110105183850.000|20110105183852.000|TR0|have covered him for some time know that 
20110105183852.000|20110105183854.000|TR0|when he gets -- he's an emotional guy, and 
20110105183854.000|20110105183855.000|TR0|when he has moments like this, he tends to 
20110105183855.000|20110105183857.000|TR0|emote in a big way.
20110105183857.000|20110105183859.000|TR0|
20110105183859.000|20110105183901.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And we know that these remarks 
20110105183901.000|20110105183903.000|TR0|will be carefully drafted, carefully 
20110105183903.000|20110105183905.000|TR0|written, Nancy Pelosi's remarks 
20110105183905.000|20110105183906.000|TR0|introducing the Speaker- elect, and of 
20110105183906.000|20110105183908.000|TR0|course, the Speaker himself, John Boehner, 
20110105183908.000|20110105183910.000|TR0|will be delivering his remarks.  I'm sure 
20110105183910.000|20110105183912.000|TR0|they've been working on these speeches for 
20110105183912.000|20110105183914.000|TR0|some time.
20110105183914.000|20110105183915.000|TR0|
20110105183915.000|20110105183917.000|TR0|One technical issue.  I don't know if you 
20110105183917.000|20110105183919.000|TR0|know the answer to this, Dana.  Will they 
20110105183919.000|20110105183921.000|TR0|be reading from hard copy, or will they do 
20110105183921.000|20110105183923.000|TR0|what the president does when he comes to 
20110105183923.000|20110105183925.000|TR0|Capitol Hill, have a teleprompter there to 
20110105183925.000|20110105183926.000|TR0|read their speeches?
20110105183926.000|20110105183928.000|TR0|
20110105183928.000|20110105183930.000|TR0|BASH:  You know, that's a good question.  
20110105183930.000|20110105183932.000|TR0|I'm not sure if there's a teleprompter 
20110105183932.000|20110105183934.000|TR0|there today.  If my memory serves me 
20110105183934.000|20110105183935.000|TR0|correctly, they, at least in the past, 
20110105183935.000|20110105183937.000|TR0|have read from the news -- from paper in 
20110105183937.000|20110105183939.000|TR0|front of them.  But wouldn't be surprised 
20110105183939.000|20110105183941.000|TR0|if they used a teleprompter.
20110105183941.000|20110105183943.000|TR0|
20110105183943.000|20110105183945.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Well, we'll see.  We'll see soon 
20110105183945.000|20110105183946.000|TR0|enough.  We'll find out.
20110105183946.000|20110105183948.000|TR0|
20110105183948.000|20110105183950.000|TR0|I want to show our viewers this videotape. 
20110105183950.000|20110105183952.000|TR0| This is what happened four years ago, 
20110105183952.000|20110105183954.000|TR0|when at that time John Boehner handed over 
20110105183954.000|20110105183955.000|TR0|the gavel to Nancy Pelosi becoming the 
20110105183955.000|20110105183957.000|TR0|first Speaker of the House -- the first 
20110105183957.000|20110105183959.000|TR0|woman Speaker of the House.  There she 
20110105183959.000|20110105184001.000|TR0|was.  She was pretty excited. What a 
20110105184001.000|20110105184003.000|TR0|difference four years makes.  She's about 
20110105184003.000|20110105184004.000|TR0|to hand over that gavel to John Boehner 
20110105184004.000|20110105184006.000|TR0|right now.  What a change, what a dramatic 
20110105184006.000|20110105184008.000|TR0|change, indeed.  And we're getting ready 
20110105184008.000|20110105184010.000|TR0|for the sergeant-at-arms to introduce the 
20110105184010.000|20110105184012.000|TR0|Speaker-elect from the rear of the 
20110105184012.000|20110105184014.000|TR0|chamber.  We'll have that live coverage 
20110105184014.000|20110105184015.000|TR0|right after this.

20110105184021.000|20110105184023.000|TR0|BLITZER:   --  Republican congressman from 
20110105184023.000|20110105184024.000|TR0|Virginia.  He's moving up the chain of 
20110105184024.000|20110105184026.000|TR0|command as, well, in the House of 
20110105184026.000|20110105184028.000|TR0|Representatives.
20110105184028.000|20110105184030.000|TR0|
20110105184030.000|20110105184032.000|TR0|As we watch what's happening on the House 
20110105184032.000|20110105184034.000|TR0|floor, John King is standing by.  He's got 
20110105184034.000|20110105184035.000|TR0|a special guest with him who's keenly 
20110105184035.000|20110105184037.000|TR0|involved in all of this as well -- John? 
20110105184037.000|20110105184039.000|TR0|KING:  And Wolf, one of the key players in 
20110105184039.000|20110105184041.000|TR0|this next chapter in Washington divided 
20110105184041.000|20110105184043.000|TR0|government will be Senator John McCain, 
20110105184043.000|20110105184044.000|TR0|the senior senator from Arizona, of 
20110105184044.000|20110105184046.000|TR0|course, the president's opponent back in 
20110105184046.000|20110105184048.000|TR0|the last presidential election.
20110105184048.000|20110105184050.000|TR0|
20110105184050.000|20110105184052.000|TR0|I want to talk to you in a moment about 
20110105184052.000|20110105184054.000|TR0|some of the substantive challenges facing 
20110105184054.000|20110105184055.000|TR0|the country.  But as we watch this history 
20110105184055.000|20110105184057.000|TR0|unfold in the House of Representatives, I 
20110105184057.000|20110105184059.000|TR0|know over here on the Senate side, you 
20110105184059.000|20110105184101.000|TR0|like to say the House is a foreign land.
20110105184101.000|20110105184103.000|TR0|

20110105184106.000|20110105184108.000|TR0|KING:  But you know John Boehner.  He's 
20110105184108.000|20110105184110.000|TR0|been here for 20 years now. Who is he?  
20110105184110.000|20110105184112.000|TR0|And who will he be as Speaker of the House?
20110105184112.000|20110105184114.000|TR0|
20110105184114.000|20110105184115.000|TR0|SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA:  Well, he's 
20110105184115.000|20110105184117.000|TR0|a solid citizen, and he has learned the 
20110105184117.000|20110105184119.000|TR0|lessons of the past.  You notice the way 
20110105184119.000|20110105184121.000|TR0|he's approaching this whole Speakership 
20110105184121.000|20110105184123.000|TR0|with a bit of humility and modesty, as 
20110105184123.000|20110105184124.000|TR0|opposed to what happened in 1994.  I'm 
20110105184124.000|20110105184126.000|TR0|glad that Wolf showed the previous clip 
20110105184126.000|20110105184128.000|TR0|because it shows the transience of 
20110105184128.000|20110105184130.000|TR0|everything in this town.  Just four years 
20110105184130.000|20110105184132.000|TR0|ago, the Democrats had a great victory.  
20110105184132.000|20110105184134.000|TR0|And we Republicans have better understand 
20110105184134.000|20110105184135.000|TR0|that unless we satisfy what the message 
20110105184135.000|20110105184137.000|TR0|was or respond to the message of last 
20110105184137.000|20110105184139.000|TR0|November, then you're going to a different 
20110105184139.000|20110105184141.000|TR0|Speaker.
20110105184141.000|20110105184143.000|TR0|
20110105184143.000|20110105184144.000|TR0|KING:  You make an interesting point 
20110105184144.000|20110105184146.000|TR0|because many Republicans say he'll be 
20110105184146.000|20110105184148.000|TR0|different from Nancy Pelosi, but you're 
20110105184148.000|20110105184150.000|TR0|saying he better be different from Newt 
20110105184150.000|20110105184152.000|TR0|Gingrich.
20110105184152.000|20110105184153.000|TR0|
20110105184153.000|20110105184155.000|TR0|MCCAIN:  Yes, indeed.  Hubris --
20110105184155.000|20110105184157.000|TR0|
20110105184157.000|20110105184159.000|TR0|KING:  Why?
20110105184159.000|20110105184201.000|TR0|
20110105184201.000|20110105184203.000|TR0|MCCAIN:  Hubris -- the Greek god Hubris 
20110105184203.000|20110105184204.000|TR0|has brought down more than one figure in 
20110105184204.000|20110105184206.000|TR0|this town.  Look, he also has to 
20110105184206.000|20110105184208.000|TR0|understand the president is still the 
20110105184208.000|20110105184210.000|TR0|president, and I know that John 
20110105184210.000|20110105184212.000|TR0|understands that, and you can't govern 
20110105184212.000|20110105184213.000|TR0|from being Speaker.  But what you can do 
20110105184213.000|20110105184215.000|TR0|is carry out the duties of the loyal 
20110105184215.000|20110105184217.000|TR0|opposition, and try to work with the 
20110105184217.000|20110105184219.000|TR0|president where you can, and be the 
20110105184219.000|20110105184221.000|TR0|opposition where you can't.  And I think 
20110105184221.000|20110105184223.000|TR0|that John Boehner understands these 
20110105184223.000|20110105184224.000|TR0|lessons of history.  That's why you see a 
20110105184224.000|20110105184226.000|TR0|very modest approach to this job.
20110105184226.000|20110105184228.000|TR0|
20110105184228.000|20110105184230.000|TR0|KING:  He's an emotional guy.  We just saw 
20110105184230.000|20110105184232.000|TR0|him wipe his eyes as he comes up.  I want 
20110105184232.000|20110105184233.000|TR0|to sneak in one more quick question here.  
20110105184233.000|20110105184235.000|TR0|How does he manage the expectations?  He 
20110105184235.000|20110105184237.000|TR0|has all these Tea Party guys who want to 
20110105184237.000|20110105184239.000|TR0|cut spending fast.  You have some of them 
20110105184239.000|20110105184241.000|TR0|in your new Senate Republican caucus.
20110105184241.000|20110105184243.000|TR0|
20110105184243.000|20110105184244.000|TR0|MCCAIN:  Yes.
20110105184244.000|20110105184246.000|TR0|
20110105184246.000|20110105184248.000|TR0|KING:  How do you say to the new guys, I 
20110105184248.000|20110105184250.000|TR0|get it, we'll do it, but it's not going to 
20110105184250.000|20110105184252.000|TR0|be as easy as you think?
20110105184252.000|20110105184253.000|TR0|
20110105184253.000|20110105184255.000|TR0|MCCAIN:  We'd better do it.  They're 
20110105184255.000|20110105184257.000|TR0|already -- the Tea Partiers are 
20110105184257.000|20110105184259.000|TR0|disappointed in what we did in the lame 
20110105184259.000|20110105184301.000|TR0|duck session.  We just better do it.  
20110105184301.000|20110105184303.000|TR0|Otherwise, we're going to see a third 
20110105184303.000|20110105184304.000|TR0|party in America. KING:  All right.  Let's

20110105184355.000|20110105184357.000|TR0|United States.  As a student, I was there 
20110105184357.000|20110105184359.000|TR0|in the freezing cold. For some of you, it 
20110105184359.000|20110105184401.000|TR0|was -- you've read about it in the history 
20110105184401.000|20110105184402.000|TR0|books. Bob Michel and I, to us, it was our 
20110105184402.000|20110105184404.000|TR0|youth.  Right, Bob?
20110105184404.000|20110105184406.000|TR0|
20110105184406.000|20110105184408.000|TR0|I was there in the freezing and heard the 
20110105184408.000|20110105184410.000|TR0|stirring address that inspired generations 
20110105184410.000|20110105184412.000|TR0|of Americans to public service.  In his 
20110105184412.000|20110105184413.000|TR0|1962 State of the Union address right from 
20110105184413.000|20110105184415.000|TR0|here, from this dais, President Kennedy 
20110105184415.000|20110105184417.000|TR0|said to the Congress, "The Constitution 
20110105184417.000|20110105184419.000|TR0|makes us all trustees of the American 
20110105184419.000|20110105184421.000|TR0|people, custodians of the American

20110105184430.000|20110105184432.000|TR0|custodians of America's highest values.  
20110105184432.000|20110105184433.000|TR0|However we may differ, let us never lose

20110105184824.000|20110105184826.000|TR0|future worthy of their sacrifice, which 
20110105184826.000|20110105184828.000|TR0|includes good-paying jobs when they come 
20110105184828.000|20110105184830.000|TR0|home.  It's not enough that we staved off 
20110105184830.000|20110105184831.000|TR0|a depression.  Much more needs to be done

20110105184833.000|20110105184835.000|TR0|the American economy. The only acceptable 
20110105184835.000|20110105184837.000|TR0|outcome is to fully and finally restore

20110105185104.000|20110105185106.000|TR0|than most gavels here, but the gavel of 
20110105185106.000|20110105185108.000|TR0|choice by Speaker Boehner -- I now pass 
20110105185108.000|20110105185109.000|TR0|this...

20110105185144.000|20110105185146.000|TR0|Madam Speaker, thank you for your kind 
20110105185146.000|20110105185148.000|TR0|words, and thank you for your service to 
20110105185148.000|20110105185149.000|TR0|this institution.
20110105185149.000|20110105185151.000|TR0|
20110105185151.000|20110105185153.000|TR0|Secondly, I want to welcome all of our new 
20110105185153.000|20110105185155.000|TR0|members and their families on what is a 
20110105185155.000|20110105185157.000|TR0|very special day. All of us who have been 
20110105185157.000|20110105185158.000|TR0|here remember vividly that first day that 
20110105185158.000|20110105185200.000|TR0|-- that we served here. And I think any of 
20110105185200.000|20110105185202.000|TR0|us can tell you that you'll never forget 
20110105185202.000|20110105185204.000|TR0|today.
20110105185204.000|20110105185206.000|TR0|
20110105185206.000|20110105185208.000|TR0|And my own family is here, as well. I 
20110105185208.000|20110105185209.000|TR0|think you just met Debbie. And next to 
20110105185209.000|20110105185211.000|TR0|Debbie are Lindsay and Tricia, our two 
20110105185211.000|20110105185213.000|TR0|daughters. Welcome. We're glad that you're 
20110105185213.000|20110105185215.000|TR0|here.

20110105185220.000|20110105185222.000|TR0|Ten of my eleven brothers and sisters and 
20110105185222.000|20110105185224.000|TR0|sister-in-laws and brother- in-laws are 
20110105185224.000|20110105185226.000|TR0|here, as well. And my poor brother, Greg, 
20110105185226.000|20110105185228.000|TR0|who runs a restaurant down in Georgia was 
20110105185228.000|20110105185229.000|TR0|unable to be here, but I wanted to 
20110105185229.000|20110105185231.000|TR0|acknowledge him.
20110105185231.000|20110105185233.000|TR0|
20110105185233.000|20110105185235.000|TR0|I also want to acknowledge some of my 
20110105185235.000|20110105185237.000|TR0|close friends that are here from -- from 
20110105185237.000|20110105185238.000|TR0|the other side of the Capitol. You know, 
20110105185238.000|20110105185240.000|TR0|Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican 
20110105185240.000|20110105185242.000|TR0|leader, is here. And two of my best buds, 
20110105185242.000|20110105185244.000|TR0|Richard Burr from North Carolina and Saxby 
20110105185244.000|20110105185246.000|TR0|Chambliss from Georgia, along with, you 
20110105185246.000|20110105185247.000|TR0|know, my buddy, Latham (ph), thank you for 
20110105185247.000|20110105185249.000|TR0|being here, gentlemen. I appreciate it.
20110105185249.000|20110105185251.000|TR0|
20110105185251.000|20110105185253.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110105185253.000|20110105185255.000|TR0|
20110105185255.000|20110105185257.000|TR0|I'm honored and humbled to represent a 
20110105185257.000|20110105185258.000|TR0|great, hard-working community in Congress. 
20110105185258.000|20110105185300.000|TR0|The people of Ohio's Eighth Congressional 
20110105185300.000|20110105185302.000|TR0|District continue to afford me the 
20110105185302.000|20110105185304.000|TR0|privilege to serve, for which I am deeply 
20110105185304.000|20110105185306.000|TR0|grateful.
20110105185306.000|20110105185307.000|TR0|
20110105185307.000|20110105185309.000|TR0|We gather here today at a time of great 
20110105185309.000|20110105185311.000|TR0|challenges. Nearly 1 of 10 of our 
20110105185311.000|20110105185313.000|TR0|neighbors is out of work. Health care 
20110105185313.000|20110105185315.000|TR0|costs are still rising for American 
20110105185315.000|20110105185317.000|TR0|families. Our spending has caught up with 
20110105185317.000|20110105185318.000|TR0|us, and our debt soon will eclipse the 
20110105185318.000|20110105185320.000|TR0|entire size of our national economy. Hard 
20110105185320.000|20110105185322.000|TR0|work and tough decisions will be required 
20110105185322.000|20110105185324.000|TR0|of the 112th Congress.
20110105185324.000|20110105185326.000|TR0|
20110105185326.000|20110105185327.000|TR0|No longer can we fall short. No longer can 
20110105185327.000|20110105185329.000|TR0|we kick the can down the road. The people 
20110105185329.000|20110105185331.000|TR0|voted to end business as usual, and today 
20110105185331.000|20110105185333.000|TR0|we begin to carry out their instructions.
20110105185333.000|20110105185335.000|TR0|
20110105185335.000|20110105185337.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110105185337.000|20110105185338.000|TR0|
20110105185338.000|20110105185340.000|TR0|In the Catholic faith, we enter into a 
20110105185340.000|20110105185342.000|TR0|season of service by having ashes marked 
20110105185342.000|20110105185344.000|TR0|on our head. The ashes remind us that life 
20110105185344.000|20110105185346.000|TR0|in all -- all of its forms is very 
20110105185346.000|20110105185347.000|TR0|fragile, our time on this Earth fleeting. 
20110105185347.000|20110105185349.000|TR0|But as the ashes are delivered, we hear 
20110105185349.000|20110105185351.000|TR0|those humbling words: Remember, you are 
20110105185351.000|20110105185353.000|TR0|dust and to dust you shall return.
20110105185353.000|20110105185355.000|TR0|
20110105185355.000|20110105185357.000|TR0|The American people have humbled us. They 
20110105185357.000|20110105185358.000|TR0|have refreshed our memories to just how 
20110105185358.000|20110105185400.000|TR0|temporary the privilege of serving is. 
20110105185400.000|20110105185402.000|TR0|They've reminded us that everything here 
20110105185402.000|20110105185404.000|TR0|is on loan from them. That includes this 
20110105185404.000|20110105185406.000|TR0|gavel, which I accept cheerfully and 
20110105185406.000|20110105185407.000|TR0|gratefully, knowing that I am but its 
20110105185407.000|20110105185409.000|TR0|caretaker. After all, this is the people's 
20110105185409.000|20110105185411.000|TR0|House.
20110105185411.000|20110105185413.000|TR0|
20110105185413.000|20110105185415.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110105185415.000|20110105185417.000|TR0|
20110105185417.000|20110105185418.000|TR0|This is their Congress. It's not -- it's 
20110105185418.000|20110105185420.000|TR0|about them, not about us. What they want 
20110105185420.000|20110105185422.000|TR0|is a government that's honest, 
20110105185422.000|20110105185424.000|TR0|accountable, and responsive to their 
20110105185424.000|20110105185426.000|TR0|needs, a government that respects 
20110105185426.000|20110105185427.000|TR0|individual liberty, honors our heritage, 
20110105185427.000|20110105185429.000|TR0|and bows before the public that it serves.
20110105185429.000|20110105185431.000|TR0|
20110105185431.000|20110105185433.000|TR0|Let's start with the rules package that 
20110105185433.000|20110105185435.000|TR0|the House will consider today. If passed, 
20110105185435.000|20110105185436.000|TR0|it will change how this institution 
20110105185436.000|20110105185438.000|TR0|operates, with an emphasis on real 
20110105185438.000|20110105185440.000|TR0|transparency, greater accountability, and 
20110105185440.000|20110105185442.000|TR0|a renewed focus on our Constitution.
20110105185442.000|20110105185444.000|TR0|
20110105185444.000|20110105185446.000|TR0|Our aim will be to give the government 
20110105185446.000|20110105185447.000|TR0|back to the American people. In seeking 
20110105185447.000|20110105185449.000|TR0|this goal, we will part with some of the 
20110105185449.000|20110105185451.000|TR0|rituals that have come to characterize 
20110105185451.000|20110105185453.000|TR0|this institution under majorities, both 
20110105185453.000|20110105185455.000|TR0|Republican and Democrat alike. We will 
20110105185455.000|20110105185456.000|TR0|dispense with the conventional wisdom that 
20110105185456.000|20110105185458.000|TR0|bigger bills are always better, that fast 
20110105185458.000|20110105185500.000|TR0|legislating is good legislating, allowing 
20110105185500.000|20110105185502.000|TR0|amendments and open debate makes the 
20110105185502.000|20110105185504.000|TR0|legislative process less efficient than 
20110105185504.000|20110105185506.000|TR0|our forefathers had intended.
20110105185506.000|20110105185507.000|TR0|
20110105185507.000|20110105185509.000|TR0|These misconceptions have been the basis 
20110105185509.000|20110105185511.000|TR0|for the rituals of a modern Washington. 
20110105185511.000|20110105185513.000|TR0|They, in my opinion, have not been served 
20110105185513.000|20110105185515.000|TR0|well to the American people.
20110105185515.000|20110105185516.000|TR0|
20110105185516.000|20110105185518.000|TR0|Today, mindful of the lessons of the past, 
20110105185518.000|20110105185520.000|TR0|we open a new chapter. Legislators and the 
20110105185520.000|20110105185522.000|TR0|public will have three days to read a bill 
20110105185522.000|20110105185524.000|TR0|before it comes to a vote. Legislation 
20110105185524.000|20110105185526.000|TR0|will be more focused, properly 
20110105185526.000|20110105185527.000|TR0|scrutinized, and constitutionally sound.
20110105185527.000|20110105185529.000|TR0|
20110105185529.000|20110105185531.000|TR0|Committees, once bloated, will be smaller, 
20110105185531.000|20110105185533.000|TR0|with a renewed mission, including 
20110105185533.000|20110105185535.000|TR0|oversight. Old rules that have made it 
20110105185535.000|20110105185536.000|TR0|easy to increase spending will be replaced 
20110105185536.000|20110105185538.000|TR0|by new reforms that make it easier to cut 
20110105185538.000|20110105185540.000|TR0|spending. And we will start by cutting 
20110105185540.000|20110105185542.000|TR0|Congress's own budget.
20110105185542.000|20110105185544.000|TR0|

20110105185547.000|20110105185549.000|TR0|But above all else, we will welcome the 
20110105185549.000|20110105185551.000|TR0|battle of ideas, encourage it, engage it 
20110105185551.000|20110105185553.000|TR0|openly, honestly, and respectfully. As the 
20110105185553.000|20110105185555.000|TR0|chamber closest to the people, the House 
20110105185555.000|20110105185556.000|TR0|works best when it is allowed to work its 
20110105185556.000|20110105185558.000|TR0|will, and I ask members of this body to 
20110105185558.000|20110105185600.000|TR0|join me in recognizing this common truth.
20110105185600.000|20110105185602.000|TR0|
20110105185602.000|20110105185604.000|TR0|And to my colleagues in the majority, my 
20110105185604.000|20110105185606.000|TR0|message is this: We will honor our pledge 
20110105185606.000|20110105185607.000|TR0|to America, built on a process of 
20110105185607.000|20110105185609.000|TR0|listening to the American people. We will 
20110105185609.000|20110105185611.000|TR0|stand firm on our constitutional 
20110105185611.000|20110105185613.000|TR0|principles that built our party and built 
20110105185613.000|20110105185615.000|TR0|a great nation.
20110105185615.000|20110105185616.000|TR0|
20110105185616.000|20110105185618.000|TR0|We will do these things, however, in a 
20110105185618.000|20110105185620.000|TR0|manner that restores and respects the 
20110105185620.000|20110105185622.000|TR0|time-honored right of the minority to an 
20110105185622.000|20110105185624.000|TR0|honest debate, a fair and open process.
20110105185624.000|20110105185625.000|TR0|
20110105185625.000|20110105185627.000|TR0|And to my friends in the minority, I offer 
20110105185627.000|20110105185629.000|TR0|a commitment: openness. Once a tradition 
20110105185629.000|20110105185631.000|TR0|of this institution, but increasingly 
20110105185631.000|20110105185633.000|TR0|scarce in recent decades will be the new 
20110105185633.000|20110105185635.000|TR0|standard. There were no open rules in the 
20110105185635.000|20110105185636.000|TR0|House in the last Congress. In this one, 
20110105185636.000|20110105185638.000|TR0|there will be many.
20110105185638.000|20110105185640.000|TR0|
20110105185640.000|20110105185642.000|TR0|And with this restored openness, however, 
20110105185642.000|20110105185644.000|TR0|come a restored responsibility. You will 
20110105185644.000|20110105185645.000|TR0|not have the right to willfully disrupt 
20110105185645.000|20110105185647.000|TR0|the proceedings of the people's House, but 
20110105185647.000|20110105185649.000|TR0|you will always have the right to a robust 
20110105185649.000|20110105185651.000|TR0|debate and an open process that allows you 
20110105185651.000|20110105185653.000|TR0|to represent your constituents, to make 
20110105185653.000|20110105185655.000|TR0|your case, offer alternatives, and be 
20110105185655.000|20110105185656.000|TR0|heard.
20110105185656.000|20110105185658.000|TR0|
20110105185658.000|20110105185700.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110105185700.000|20110105185702.000|TR0|
20110105185702.000|20110105185704.000|TR0|In time, I believe this framework will 
20110105185704.000|20110105185705.000|TR0|allow the House to be a place where the 
20110105185705.000|20110105185707.000|TR0|people's will is done. It will also, I 
20110105185707.000|20110105185709.000|TR0|hope, rebuild trust amongst us and the 
20110105185709.000|20110105185711.000|TR0|people we serve and, in so doing, provide 
20110105185711.000|20110105185713.000|TR0|a guidepost for those who follow us in the 
20110105185713.000|20110105185715.000|TR0|service of our nation.
20110105185715.000|20110105185716.000|TR0|
20110105185716.000|20110105185718.000|TR0|To our new members, Democrat and 
20110105185718.000|20110105185720.000|TR0|Republican alike, as you take the oath 
20110105185720.000|20110105185722.000|TR0|today, I know that you do so mindful of 
20110105185722.000|20110105185724.000|TR0|this shared goal and -- and know that your 
20110105185724.000|20110105185725.000|TR0|constituents have placed much trust in you.
20110105185725.000|20110105185727.000|TR0|
20110105185727.000|20110105185729.000|TR0|As speaker, I feel part of my job is to 
20110105185729.000|20110105185731.000|TR0|help each of you do your job well, 
20110105185731.000|20110105185733.000|TR0|regardless of your political party. My -- 
20110105185733.000|20110105185735.000|TR0|my hope is -- is that every new member -- 
20110105185735.000|20110105185736.000|TR0|and, indeed, every member -- will be 
20110105185736.000|20110105185738.000|TR0|comfortable with approaching me with 
20110105185738.000|20110105185740.000|TR0|regard to matters of the House.
20110105185740.000|20110105185742.000|TR0|
20110105185742.000|20110105185744.000|TR0|We will not always get it right, and we 
20110105185744.000|20110105185745.000|TR0|will not always agree on what is right. 
20110105185745.000|20110105185747.000|TR0|There's a great deal of scar tissue that's 
20110105185747.000|20110105185749.000|TR0|been built up on both sides of the aisle. 
20110105185749.000|20110105185751.000|TR0|We can't ignore that, nor should we.
20110105185751.000|20110105185753.000|TR0|
20110105185753.000|20110105185755.000|TR0|My belief has always been that we can 
20110105185755.000|20110105185756.000|TR0|disagree without being disagreeable. 
20110105185756.000|20110105185758.000|TR0|That's why it's critical that this 
20110105185758.000|20110105185800.000|TR0|institution operate in a matter that 
20110105185800.000|20110105185802.000|TR0|permits a free exchange of ideas and 
20110105185802.000|20110105185804.000|TR0|resolves our honest differences through a 
20110105185804.000|20110105185805.000|TR0|fair debate and vote.
20110105185805.000|20110105185807.000|TR0|
20110105185807.000|20110105185809.000|TR0|We may have different -- sometimes very 
20110105185809.000|20110105185811.000|TR0|different -- ideas about how to go 
20110105185811.000|20110105185813.000|TR0|achieving the common good. It is why we 
20110105185813.000|20110105185814.000|TR0|serve. Let us now move forward, humble in 
20110105185814.000|20110105185816.000|TR0|our demeanor, steady in our principles, 
20110105185816.000|20110105185818.000|TR0|dedicated to proving worthy of the trust 
20110105185818.000|20110105185820.000|TR0|and confidence that has been placed in 
20110105185820.000|20110105185822.000|TR0|each of us.
20110105185822.000|20110105185824.000|TR0|
20110105185824.000|20110105185825.000|TR0|If we brace ourselves to do our duty and 
20110105185825.000|20110105185827.000|TR0|say -- say -- do what we say we're going 
20110105185827.000|20110105185829.000|TR0|to do, I don't think that there's together 
20110105185829.000|20110105185831.000|TR0|anything that we can't accomplish, again, 
20110105185831.000|20110105185833.000|TR0|on behalf of the people we serve.
20110105185833.000|20110105185834.000|TR0|
20110105185834.000|20110105185836.000|TR0|More than a country, America is an idea. 
20110105185836.000|20110105185838.000|TR0|And it's our job to pass that posterity of 
20110105185838.000|20110105185840.000|TR0|blessings that have been bestowed on us to 
20110105185840.000|20110105185842.000|TR0|those generations that follow us.
20110105185842.000|20110105185844.000|TR0|
20110105185844.000|20110105185845.000|TR0|I want to wish all of you the very best. 
20110105185845.000|20110105185847.000|TR0|Welcome to the people's House. Welcome to

20110105185854.000|20110105185856.000|TR0|I am now ready to take the oath of office, 
20110105185856.000|20110105185858.000|TR0|and I ask the dean of the House, the 
20110105185858.000|20110105185900.000|TR0|honorable John Dingell of Michigan, to 
20110105185900.000|20110105185902.000|TR0|administer the oath of office.
20110105185902.000|20110105185904.000|TR0|
20110105185904.000|20110105185905.000|TR0|DINGELL: I thank you. If the gentleman 
20110105185905.000|20110105185907.000|TR0|from Ohio will please raise his right hand.
20110105185907.000|20110105185909.000|TR0|
20110105185909.000|20110105185911.000|TR0|Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you

20110105185918.000|20110105185920.000|TR0|that you take this obligation freely,

20110105185922.000|20110105185924.000|TR0|of evasion, and that you will well and
