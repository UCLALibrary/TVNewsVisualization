20110110230007.000|20110110230009.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  You're in the 
20110110230009.000|20110110230011.000|TR0|SITUATION ROOM. Happening now, caught in 
20110110230011.000|20110110230014.000|TR0|the middle of a bloody rampage.  They were 
20110110230014.000|20110110230016.000|TR0|average citizens, but they became heroes.  
20110110230016.000|20110110230019.000|TR0|And they have saved many more lives in 
20110110230019.000|20110110230021.000|TR0|that Tucson massacre.  I'll speak with a 
20110110230021.000|20110110230024.000|TR0|retired U.S. army colonel who helped 
20110110230024.000|20110110230026.000|TR0|tackle the gunman.
20110110230026.000|20110110230029.000|TR0|
20110110230029.000|20110110230031.000|TR0|Also in shackles, his head saved, the 
20110110230031.000|20110110230034.000|TR0|alleged shooter makes his first court 
20110110230034.000|20110110230036.000|TR0|appearance.  And we're going to hear the 
20110110230036.000|20110110230039.000|TR0|federal charges against him.  He's 
20110110230039.000|20110110230041.000|TR0|speaking out as well.  Stand by.
20110110230041.000|20110110230044.000|TR0|
20110110230044.000|20110110230046.000|TR0|And he was known as the Hammer, once one 
20110110230046.000|20110110230049.000|TR0|of the country's most powerful Republican 
20110110230049.000|20110110230051.000|TR0|politicians, now the former House Majority 
20110110230051.000|20110110230054.000|TR0|Leader Tom DeLay facing prison.

20110110230056.000|20110110230059.000|TR0|Want to welcome our viewers in the United 
20110110230059.000|20110110230101.000|TR0|States and around the world.  Breaking

20110110230104.000|20110110230106.000|TR0|all straight ahead.  I'm Wolf Blitzer.  
20110110230106.000|20110110230109.000|TR0|You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.
20110110230109.000|20110110230111.000|TR0|
20110110230111.000|20110110230113.000|TR0|The Pima County, Arizona, Sheriff's Office 
20110110230113.000|20110110230116.000|TR0|just released this picture of the Tucson 
20110110230116.000|20110110230118.000|TR0|gunman, head shaves and grinning.  Late 
20110110230118.000|20110110230121.000|TR0|this afternoon, 22-year-old Jared Lee 
20110110230121.000|20110110230123.000|TR0|Loughner talked during his first court 
20110110230123.000|20110110230126.000|TR0|appearance, answering to federal charges, 
20110110230126.000|20110110230128.000|TR0|including murder and the attempted 
20110110230128.000|20110110230131.000|TR0|assassination of a member of the United 
20110110230131.000|20110110230133.000|TR0|States Congress.
20110110230133.000|20110110230136.000|TR0|
20110110230136.000|20110110230138.000|TR0|Doctors say Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110110230138.000|20110110230141.000|TR0|Giffords is holding her own. She's being 
20110110230141.000|20110110230143.000|TR0|kept asleep by doctors, is in critical, 
20110110230143.000|20110110230146.000|TR0|but stable condition.  Doctors say they're 
20110110230146.000|20110110230148.000|TR0|-- quote -- "cautiously optimistic."
20110110230148.000|20110110230151.000|TR0|
20110110230151.000|20110110230153.000|TR0|We have all of the angles on this major 
20110110230153.000|20110110230156.000|TR0|story covered for you. But we want to 
20110110230156.000|20110110230158.000|TR0|begin with Loughner's first court 
20110110230158.000|20110110230201.000|TR0|appearance today.
20110110230201.000|20110110230203.000|TR0|
20110110230203.000|20110110230206.000|TR0|Let's go straight to CNN's Ted Rowlands.  
20110110230206.000|20110110230208.000|TR0|He was inside the courtroom, only a couple 
20110110230208.000|20110110230211.000|TR0|of feet away from this accused killer.
20110110230211.000|20110110230213.000|TR0|
20110110230213.000|20110110230215.000|TR0|How did it go, Ted?
20110110230215.000|20110110230218.000|TR0|
20110110230218.000|20110110230220.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110110230220.000|20110110230223.000|TR0|Wolf, as you see in that mug shot, he came 
20110110230223.000|20110110230225.000|TR0|in with his head shaved.  We'd seen photos 
20110110230225.000|20110110230228.000|TR0|of him with a lot of hair.  So that was a 
20110110230228.000|20110110230230.000|TR0|little bit dramatic, as he came in a side 
20110110230230.000|20110110230233.000|TR0|entrance to the courtroom.
20110110230233.000|20110110230235.000|TR0|
20110110230235.000|20110110230238.000|TR0|He first was seated with his lawyer.  And 
20110110230238.000|20110110230240.000|TR0|then, when the judge took the bench, he 
20110110230240.000|20110110230243.000|TR0|went up to a podium and answered questions 
20110110230243.000|20110110230245.000|TR0|of the judge.  When he was first seated, 
20110110230245.000|20110110230248.000|TR0|he was looking around a little bit, looked 
20110110230248.000|20110110230250.000|TR0|at the ceiling, and then stared straight 
20110110230250.000|20110110230253.000|TR0|ahead and seemed to be quite nervous.
20110110230253.000|20110110230255.000|TR0|
20110110230255.000|20110110230258.000|TR0|But when he got to the podium and the 
20110110230258.000|20110110230300.000|TR0|judge engaged him, he answered every 
20110110230300.000|20110110230303.000|TR0|question the judge had.  He repeated his 
20110110230303.000|20110110230305.000|TR0|name for the judge.  He had a very strong 
20110110230305.000|20110110230308.000|TR0|voice.  And then the judge started reading 
20110110230308.000|20110110230310.000|TR0|the charges one by one to Loughner, 
20110110230310.000|20110110230313.000|TR0|starting out with the first count he was 
20110110230313.000|20110110230315.000|TR0|faced with, which was the attempted 
20110110230315.000|20110110230318.000|TR0|assassination of a member of Congress.
20110110230318.000|20110110230320.000|TR0|
20110110230320.000|20110110230322.000|TR0|Counts two and three were attempted murder 
20110110230322.000|20110110230325.000|TR0|-- or the murders of Gabe Zimmerman and 
20110110230325.000|20110110230327.000|TR0|John Roll.  Gabe Zimmerman of course was a 
20110110230327.000|20110110230330.000|TR0|staffer of the congresswoman's.  And John 
20110110230330.000|20110110230332.000|TR0|Roll is a U.S. -- was a U.S. federal judge.
20110110230332.000|20110110230335.000|TR0|
20110110230335.000|20110110230337.000|TR0|And when the judge in this case read that 
20110110230337.000|20110110230340.000|TR0|charge against -- that had to do with the 
20110110230340.000|20110110230342.000|TR0|death of John Roll, you could feel in the 
20110110230342.000|20110110230345.000|TR0|courtroom he seemed to pause, because he 
20110110230345.000|20110110230347.000|TR0|was obviously talking about the death of 
20110110230347.000|20110110230350.000|TR0|one of his colleagues, the murder of one 
20110110230350.000|20110110230352.000|TR0|of his colleagues.
20110110230352.000|20110110230355.000|TR0|
20110110230355.000|20110110230357.000|TR0|Then the judge went on and read the two 
20110110230357.000|20110110230400.000|TR0|remaining charges, attempted murder Pam 
20110110230400.000|20110110230402.000|TR0|Simon and the attempted murder of Ron 
20110110230402.000|20110110230405.000|TR0|Barber, also members of the 
20110110230405.000|20110110230407.000|TR0|congresswoman's staff.  The maximum 
20110110230407.000|20110110230410.000|TR0|sentence for the attempted murders, 
20110110230410.000|20110110230412.000|TR0|20-plus years.  The maximum sentence for 
20110110230412.000|20110110230415.000|TR0|the assassination attempt on a 
20110110230415.000|20110110230417.000|TR0|congresswoman is life in prison.  And 
20110110230417.000|20110110230420.000|TR0|then, of course, the maximum sentence for 
20110110230420.000|20110110230422.000|TR0|the other two murders is the death penalty.
20110110230422.000|20110110230424.000|TR0|
20110110230424.000|20110110230427.000|TR0|Periodically throughout this proceeding, 
20110110230427.000|20110110230429.000|TR0|which only lasted about 15 minutes, the 
20110110230429.000|20110110230432.000|TR0|judge would ask questions.  The judge at 
20110110230432.000|20110110230434.000|TR0|one point held up a document and asked the 
20110110230434.000|20110110230437.000|TR0|defendant, did you fill this out? Did you 
20110110230437.000|20110110230439.000|TR0|sign this?  I can't read this signature.
20110110230439.000|20110110230442.000|TR0|
20110110230442.000|20110110230444.000|TR0|The judge -- or the defendant said, yes, I 
20110110230444.000|20110110230447.000|TR0|did.  Yes.  Then he said, did someone help 
20110110230447.000|20110110230449.000|TR0|you with this?  He said, yes, Ms. Clarke 
20110110230449.000|20110110230452.000|TR0|helped me with this.
20110110230452.000|20110110230454.000|TR0|
20110110230454.000|20110110230457.000|TR0|Ms. Clarke is his public defender.  We 
20110110230457.000|20110110230459.000|TR0|just heard the piece about her.  She was 
20110110230459.000|20110110230502.000|TR0|next to him throughout this entire 
20110110230502.000|20110110230504.000|TR0|proceeding.  Again, it lasted about 15 
20110110230504.000|20110110230507.000|TR0|minutes.  He exited the courtroom.  He 
20110110230507.000|20110110230509.000|TR0|didn't look around the courtroom.  He was 
20110110230509.000|20110110230512.000|TR0|focused on the judge.  But clearly he 
20110110230512.000|20110110230514.000|TR0|understood everything that was going on 
20110110230514.000|20110110230517.000|TR0|around him, and he understood every 
20110110230517.000|20110110230519.000|TR0|question the judge had.  He was 
20110110230519.000|20110110230522.000|TR0|articulate, and he had a strong voice with 
20110110230522.000|20110110230524.000|TR0|all of his answers.
20110110230524.000|20110110230526.000|TR0|
20110110230526.000|20110110230529.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And you were only a few feet, 
20110110230529.000|20110110230531.000|TR0|two feet or three feet away from him, I 
20110110230531.000|20110110230534.000|TR0|take it, Ted.  Some of his classmates at 
20110110230534.000|20110110230536.000|TR0|that community college in Pima County were 
20110110230536.000|20110110230539.000|TR0|saying he would stand up, start rambling, 
20110110230539.000|20110110230541.000|TR0|start saying ridiculous things.  But you 
20110110230541.000|20110110230544.000|TR0|saw none of that. He seemed normal to you, 
20110110230544.000|20110110230546.000|TR0|well aware of what was going on, not crazy 
20110110230546.000|20110110230549.000|TR0|by any means?
20110110230549.000|20110110230551.000|TR0|
20110110230551.000|20110110230554.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Yes.
20110110230554.000|20110110230556.000|TR0|
20110110230556.000|20110110230559.000|TR0|When he first came into the courtroom, his 
20110110230559.000|20110110230601.000|TR0|eyes were darting back and forth very 
20110110230601.000|20110110230604.000|TR0|rapidly and he was walking right towards 
20110110230604.000|20110110230606.000|TR0|me as he took his seat.  I was in the 
20110110230606.000|20110110230609.000|TR0|front row.  So we were about two to three 
20110110230609.000|20110110230611.000|TR0|feet away from each other.       And at 
20110110230611.000|20110110230614.000|TR0|that point, I was thinking, well, I wonder 
20110110230614.000|20110110230616.000|TR0|if he's going to start in with a ramble or 
20110110230616.000|20110110230619.000|TR0|not, because he seemed very nervous.  But 
20110110230619.000|20110110230621.000|TR0|then as soon as the judge took the stand 
20110110230621.000|20110110230624.000|TR0|and as soon as he started to communicate 
20110110230624.000|20110110230626.000|TR0|with his lawyer and the judge, it was 
20110110230626.000|20110110230629.000|TR0|clear that he was understanding -- he 
20110110230629.000|20110110230631.000|TR0|understood exactly what was going on.  And 
20110110230631.000|20110110230633.000|TR0|he was very clear in all of his answers.
20110110230633.000|20110110230636.000|TR0|
20110110230636.000|20110110230638.000|TR0|And he had a very strong voice, which a 
20110110230638.000|20110110230641.000|TR0|lot of times you don't see in this 
20110110230641.000|20110110230643.000|TR0|situation.  You see someone up there who 
20110110230643.000|20110110230646.000|TR0|is very emotional, has a weak voice.  He 
20110110230646.000|20110110230648.000|TR0|was stiff and he had a strong voice and 
20110110230648.000|20110110230651.000|TR0|answered every question that he was asked 
20110110230651.000|20110110230653.000|TR0|by this judge.

20110110230656.000|20110110230658.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Ted Rowlands was an eyewitness 
20110110230658.000|20110110230701.000|TR0|in that courtroom today.
20110110230701.000|20110110230703.000|TR0|
20110110230703.000|20110110230706.000|TR0|All right, Ted, thank you.

20110110230708.000|20110110230711.000|TR0|The horrific shooting in Tucson did 
20110110230711.000|20110110230713.000|TR0|produce several heroes. President Obama 
20110110230713.000|20110110230716.000|TR0|says we should focus on the extraordinary 
20110110230716.000|20110110230718.000|TR0|courage displayed during the tragedy.

20110110230728.000|20110110230731.000|TR0|STATES:  A 20-year-old college student who 
20110110230731.000|20110110230733.000|TR0|ran into the line of fire to rescue his 
20110110230733.000|20110110230735.000|TR0|boss, a wounded woman who helped secure 
20110110230735.000|20110110230738.000|TR0|the ammunition that might have caused even 
20110110230738.000|20110110230740.000|TR0|more damage, the citizens who wrestled 
20110110230740.000|20110110230743.000|TR0|down the gunman.  Part of what I think 
20110110230743.000|20110110230745.000|TR0|that speaks to is the best of America, 
20110110230745.000|20110110230748.000|TR0|even in the face of such mindless violence.

20110110230750.000|20110110230753.000|TR0|And so in the coming days we're going to

20110110230823.000|20110110230825.000|TR0|COL. BILL BADGER (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  I 
20110110230825.000|20110110230828.000|TR0|went down and registered and was standing 
20110110230828.000|20110110230830.000|TR0|in line.  And it was less than two minutes 
20110110230830.000|20110110230833.000|TR0|after I stood in line, why, shots were 
20110110230833.000|20110110230835.000|TR0|fired.
20110110230835.000|20110110230837.000|TR0|
20110110230837.000|20110110230840.000|TR0|And it was just one shot right after the 
20110110230840.000|20110110230842.000|TR0|other, just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  
20110110230842.000|20110110230845.000|TR0|And as soon as I heard the first one, I 
20110110230845.000|20110110230847.000|TR0|thought that somebody had threw a bunch of 
20110110230847.000|20110110230850.000|TR0|firecrackers.  And -- but then I could see 
20110110230850.000|20110110230852.000|TR0|that he actually was shooting a gun.  And 
20110110230852.000|20110110230855.000|TR0|that was a gun.
20110110230855.000|20110110230857.000|TR0|
20110110230857.000|20110110230900.000|TR0|And he'd already shot the congresswoman, 
20110110230900.000|20110110230902.000|TR0|Judge Roll, and a little 9-year-old girl.  
20110110230902.000|20110110230905.000|TR0|And then he was shooting right down the 
20110110230905.000|20110110230907.000|TR0|line.  He was not walking.  He was just 
20110110230907.000|20110110230910.000|TR0|aiming at the people that were sitting in 
20110110230910.000|20110110230912.000|TR0|the 12 chairs.  I could see that as he was 
20110110230912.000|20110110230915.000|TR0|-- you could see some of them, he was 
20110110230915.000|20110110230917.000|TR0|hitting, they were falling.  Others were 
20110110230917.000|20110110230920.000|TR0|diving for the ground.       And I could 
20110110230920.000|20110110230922.000|TR0|-- I was at the end of the row of chairs, 
20110110230922.000|20110110230925.000|TR0|so I knew I better hit the ground.  I 
20110110230925.000|20110110230927.000|TR0|turned to my left and went to hit the 
20110110230927.000|20110110230930.000|TR0|ground, and I heard -- felt this terrible 
20110110230930.000|20110110230932.000|TR0|sting right in the back of my head.  And I 
20110110230932.000|20110110230935.000|TR0|knew that I had been hit.  But I went 
20110110230935.000|20110110230937.000|TR0|right on down to the ground.
20110110230937.000|20110110230940.000|TR0|
20110110230940.000|20110110230942.000|TR0|And he fired approximately, you know, 18 
20110110230942.000|20110110230944.000|TR0|to 20 shots and then stopped shooting.  
20110110230944.000|20110110230947.000|TR0|When he stopped shooting, why, I stood up. 
20110110230947.000|20110110230949.000|TR0| And when I stood up, I didn't realize 
20110110230949.000|20110110230952.000|TR0|that this individual was walking right in 
20110110230952.000|20110110230954.000|TR0|front of me with a -- within a foot of 
20110110230954.000|20110110230957.000|TR0|stepping on my toes. And he was going to 
20110110230957.000|20110110230959.000|TR0|my left.
20110110230959.000|20110110231002.000|TR0|
20110110231002.000|20110110231004.000|TR0|And he just got past me when some other 
20110110231004.000|20110110231007.000|TR0|individual that was there to meet with the 
20110110231007.000|20110110231009.000|TR0|congresswoman took one of the chairs that 
20110110231009.000|20110110231012.000|TR0|they had been sitting on, folded it, and 
20110110231012.000|20110110231014.000|TR0|hit him over the back of the head. 
20110110231014.000|20110110231017.000|TR0|Actually, he saw it coming.  He ducked and 
20110110231017.000|20110110231019.000|TR0|it hit him right on the shoulders.  But 
20110110231019.000|20110110231022.000|TR0|when he did that, his left hand flew out.  
20110110231022.000|20110110231024.000|TR0|His gun was in the right hand.  And I had 
20110110231024.000|20110110231027.000|TR0|the opportunity to grab his left wrist.
20110110231027.000|20110110231029.000|TR0|
20110110231029.000|20110110231032.000|TR0|And I grabbed his left wrist, and with my 
20110110231032.000|20110110231034.000|TR0|right hand I hit him right, you know, 
20110110231034.000|20110110231037.000|TR0|between the shoulder blades.  And he was 
20110110231037.000|20110110231039.000|TR0|going down. At the same time that this was 
20110110231039.000|20110110231042.000|TR0|going on, there was a woman that was -- 
20110110231042.000|20110110231044.000|TR0|she was sure she was going to be shot 
20110110231044.000|20110110231046.000|TR0|because he was walking right towards her 
20110110231046.000|20110110231049.000|TR0|with the gun.
20110110231049.000|20110110231051.000|TR0|
20110110231051.000|20110110231054.000|TR0|But when he got -- you know, right before 
20110110231054.000|20110110231056.000|TR0|he got to her and when he was right in 
20110110231056.000|20110110231059.000|TR0|front of me, why, he took the clip, 
20110110231059.000|20110110231101.000|TR0|another clip out of his pocket.  And she 
20110110231101.000|20110110231104.000|TR0|reached up and grabbed the clip and threw 
20110110231104.000|20110110231106.000|TR0|it to the ground, just because she wanted 
20110110231106.000|20110110231109.000|TR0|to.
20110110231109.000|20110110231111.000|TR0|
20110110231111.000|20110110231114.000|TR0|And this happened at exactly the same time 
20110110231114.000|20110110231116.000|TR0|we were taking the individual to the 
20110110231116.000|20110110231119.000|TR0|ground.  And so, when he hit the ground, 
20110110231119.000|20110110231121.000|TR0|his gun was laying about 6 inches in front 
20110110231121.000|20110110231124.000|TR0|of his left hand.  And another individual 
20110110231124.000|20110110231126.000|TR0|that was there to see the congresswoman 
20110110231126.000|20110110231129.000|TR0|reached down and grabbed the gun to take 
20110110231129.000|20110110231131.000|TR0|it away from him, to get it away, so he 
20110110231131.000|20110110231134.000|TR0|couldn't get it.
20110110231134.000|20110110231136.000|TR0|
20110110231136.000|20110110231139.000|TR0|And as soon as he picked the gun up, why, 
20110110231139.000|20110110231141.000|TR0|I said, drop the gun, drop it quick, 
20110110231141.000|20110110231144.000|TR0|because I was afraid that some law 
20110110231144.000|20110110231146.000|TR0|enforcement person would see this 
20110110231146.000|20110110231149.000|TR0|individual holding this gun and would 
20110110231149.000|20110110231151.000|TR0|shoot him.  And as soon as I told him to 
20110110231151.000|20110110231153.000|TR0|drop it, he dropped it.
20110110231153.000|20110110231156.000|TR0|
20110110231156.000|20110110231158.000|TR0|The real hero here is the individual that 
20110110231158.000|20110110231201.000|TR0|picked up the chair and hit him and the 
20110110231201.000|20110110231203.000|TR0|other individual who helped me take this 
20110110231203.000|20110110231206.000|TR0|individual down to the ground.
20110110231206.000|20110110231208.000|TR0|
20110110231208.000|20110110231211.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Did he say anything, the gunman, 
20110110231211.000|20110110231213.000|TR0|during the time you pounced on top of him 
20110110231213.000|20110110231216.000|TR0|and were holding him down?
20110110231216.000|20110110231218.000|TR0|
20110110231218.000|20110110231221.000|TR0|BILL BADGER:  The only thing he said was 
20110110231221.000|20110110231223.000|TR0|-- I asked him, I said, what in the world 
20110110231223.000|20110110231226.000|TR0|did you do something like this for?  And 
20110110231226.000|20110110231228.000|TR0|he didn't answer me.
20110110231228.000|20110110231231.000|TR0|
20110110231231.000|20110110231233.000|TR0|And I had my left hand.  I was choking 
20110110231233.000|20110110231236.000|TR0|him.  And the other individual had his 
20110110231236.000|20110110231238.000|TR0|knee on the back of his neck.  About that 
20110110231238.000|20110110231241.000|TR0|time, the other individual put a lot more 
20110110231241.000|20110110231243.000|TR0|weight on his neck.  And it pushed his 
20110110231243.000|20110110231246.000|TR0|face right into the sidewalk.  And he 
20110110231246.000|20110110231248.000|TR0|hollered, ow, ow, ow, ow.  And that was 
20110110231248.000|20110110231251.000|TR0|the only thing he said.
20110110231251.000|20110110231253.000|TR0|
20110110231253.000|20110110231255.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Did you realize at the time that 
20110110231255.000|20110110231258.000|TR0|you yourself had been hit by one of these 
20110110231258.000|20110110231300.000|TR0|bullets in the back of your head?
20110110231300.000|20110110231303.000|TR0|
20110110231303.000|20110110231305.000|TR0|BADGER:  I knew that I had been hit, but I 
20110110231305.000|20110110231308.000|TR0|didn't know how serious it was.
20110110231308.000|20110110231310.000|TR0|
20110110231310.000|20110110231313.000|TR0|And while I was holding the individual 
20110110231313.000|20110110231315.000|TR0|down -- we had to hold him from five to 10 
20110110231315.000|20110110231318.000|TR0|minutes before the first deputy got there 
20110110231318.000|20110110231320.000|TR0|with the handcuffs to take the individual. 
20110110231320.000|20110110231323.000|TR0| And while I was holding him down, why, 
20110110231323.000|20110110231325.000|TR0|there was a massive amount of blood 
20110110231325.000|20110110231328.000|TR0|running down the side of my face, you 
20110110231328.000|20110110231330.000|TR0|know, down my arm, all over him and all 
20110110231330.000|20110110231333.000|TR0|over the sidewalk.
20110110231333.000|20110110231335.000|TR0|
20110110231335.000|20110110231338.000|TR0|And I -- I really didn't realize that it 
20110110231338.000|20110110231340.000|TR0|was coming from me until this woman who 
20110110231340.000|20110110231343.000|TR0|had knocked the clip out of his hand said, 
20110110231343.000|20110110231345.000|TR0|you're wounded bad, Bill.  Or she didn't 
20110110231345.000|20110110231348.000|TR0|say Bill, because at that time she didn't 
20110110231348.000|20110110231350.000|TR0|know my name.  She said, you're wounded 
20110110231350.000|20110110231353.000|TR0|bad.  She ran into the Safeway, got some 
20110110231353.000|20110110231355.000|TR0|paper towels and water and brought it back 
20110110231355.000|20110110231357.000|TR0|out and put it on the back of my head and 
20110110231357.000|20110110231400.000|TR0|started, you know, treating the back of my 
20110110231400.000|20110110231402.000|TR0|head.
20110110231402.000|20110110231405.000|TR0|
20110110231405.000|20110110231407.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So how seriously injured -- how 
20110110231407.000|20110110231410.000|TR0|seriously wounded are you right now?
20110110231410.000|20110110231412.000|TR0|
20110110231412.000|20110110231415.000|TR0|BADGER:  Well, the wound is about three 
20110110231415.000|20110110231417.000|TR0|inches long.  It's about a half-inch 
20110110231417.000|20110110231420.000|TR0|across and about a quarter-inch deep.
20110110231420.000|20110110231422.000|TR0|
20110110231422.000|20110110231425.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Do you -- what is the prognosis 
20110110231425.000|20110110231427.000|TR0|for you?  What are the doctors saying 
20110110231427.000|20110110231430.000|TR0|about your recovery, the healing of this 
20110110231430.000|20110110231432.000|TR0|wound?
20110110231432.000|20110110231435.000|TR0|
20110110231435.000|20110110231437.000|TR0|BADGER:  They -- they took me in the 
20110110231437.000|20110110231440.000|TR0|ambulance and took me to St. Mary's 
20110110231440.000|20110110231442.000|TR0|Hospital.  And right away, they did an MRI 
20110110231442.000|20110110231445.000|TR0|and a CAT scan.  And the doctor -- 
20110110231445.000|20110110231447.000|TR0|everybody very professional there, too.  
20110110231447.000|20110110231450.000|TR0|But Dr. Brown (ph), she read the MRI and 
20110110231450.000|20110110231452.000|TR0|she said there was no damage, you know, to 
20110110231452.000|20110110231455.000|TR0|the brain or to the inside of this scalp.
20110110231455.000|20110110231457.000|TR0|
20110110231457.000|20110110231500.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Colonel, how are you dealing 
20110110231500.000|20110110231502.000|TR0|with this?  What are you feeling?  What's 
20110110231502.000|20110110231504.000|TR0|going through your mind?
20110110231504.000|20110110231507.000|TR0|
20110110231507.000|20110110231509.000|TR0|BADGER:  Well, you know, as far as the 
20110110231509.000|20110110231512.000|TR0|head is concerned, it's just numb.  You 
20110110231512.000|20110110231514.000|TR0|know, I'm taking quite a few aspirin for 
20110110231514.000|20110110231517.000|TR0|any pain. But the first 24 hours, the 
20110110231517.000|20110110231519.000|TR0|adrenaline was running so much, that it -- 
20110110231519.000|20110110231522.000|TR0|you know, I was pretty steady the first 24 
20110110231522.000|20110110231524.000|TR0|hours.  I'm a little bit more nervous now 
20110110231524.000|20110110231527.000|TR0|than I was then.
20110110231527.000|20110110231529.000|TR0|
20110110231529.000|20110110231532.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Colonel, do you own or carry a 
20110110231532.000|20110110231534.000|TR0|gun?
20110110231534.000|20110110231537.000|TR0|
20110110231537.000|20110110231539.000|TR0|BADGER:  No.
20110110231539.000|20110110231542.000|TR0|
20110110231542.000|20110110231544.000|TR0|I have got a 21-year-old son.  And when he 
20110110231544.000|20110110231547.000|TR0|was born, my wife made me get rid of .38.  
20110110231547.000|20110110231549.000|TR0|I had one up until that time.
20110110231549.000|20110110231552.000|TR0|
20110110231552.000|20110110231554.000|TR0|But, you know, if I could say something 
20110110231554.000|20110110231557.000|TR0|right now, that something is drastically 
20110110231557.000|20110110231559.000|TR0|wrong with what's going on in our United 
20110110231559.000|20110110231602.000|TR0|States right now.  And when an individual 
20110110231602.000|20110110231604.000|TR0|is turned down to get into the military 
20110110231604.000|20110110231606.000|TR0|and then can be -- is able to go out and 
20110110231606.000|20110110231609.000|TR0|buy a .9-millimeter Glock pistol, and he 
20110110231609.000|20110110231611.000|TR0|had one of the -- or his clips were the 
20110110231611.000|20110110231614.000|TR0|extended clips that were limited to law 
20110110231614.000|20110110231616.000|TR0|enforcement only, and, you know, that -- 
20110110231616.000|20110110231619.000|TR0|or somebody has to put a stop to that.
20110110231619.000|20110110231621.000|TR0|
20110110231621.000|20110110231624.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Colonel Bill Badger, retired 
20110110231624.000|20110110231626.000|TR0|U.S. Army, thanks so much, not only for 
20110110231626.000|20110110231629.000|TR0|joining us.  Much more importantly, thanks 
20110110231629.000|20110110231631.000|TR0|for doing what you did Saturday morning in 
20110110231631.000|20110110231634.000|TR0|Tucson.  We appreciate it very much.
20110110231634.000|20110110231636.000|TR0|
20110110231636.000|20110110231639.000|TR0|BADGER:  Wolf, and thank you.  And keep up 
20110110231639.000|20110110231641.000|TR0|the great work.
20110110231641.000|20110110231644.000|TR0|

20110110231649.000|20110110231651.000|TR0|BLITZER:  A remarkable 74-year-old man.
20110110231651.000|20110110231654.000|TR0|
20110110231654.000|20110110231656.000|TR0|These are live pictures from Tucson right 
20110110231656.000|20110110231659.000|TR0|now, the vigil continuing there, the vigil 
20110110231659.000|20110110231701.000|TR0|in memory of those who died, six 
20110110231701.000|20110110231704.000|TR0|individuals.  Six lives were cut short by 
20110110231704.000|20110110231706.000|TR0|this gunman.
20110110231706.000|20110110231708.000|TR0|
20110110231708.000|20110110231711.000|TR0|The youngest victim was 9-year-old 
20110110231711.000|20110110231713.000|TR0|Christina Taylor Green.  She was born on 
20110110231713.000|20110110231716.000|TR0|September 11, 1991 (sic).  She was a 
20110110231716.000|20110110231718.000|TR0|third-grader, a student council member who 
20110110231718.000|20110110231721.000|TR0|was at Congresswoman Giffords' constituent 
20110110231721.000|20110110231723.000|TR0|meeting because of an interest in 
20110110231723.000|20110110231726.000|TR0|government.  She was the only girl on her 
20110110231726.000|20110110231728.000|TR0|little league baseball team.  Her father 
20110110231728.000|20110110231731.000|TR0|is a Major League scout.  Her grandfather, 
20110110231731.000|20110110231733.000|TR0|by the way, was a Major League manager.
20110110231733.000|20110110231736.000|TR0|
20110110231736.000|20110110231738.000|TR0|John Roll, 63 years old, was Arizona's

20110110231743.000|20110110231746.000|TR0|Phyllis Schneck was a 79-year-old 
20110110231746.000|20110110231748.000|TR0|grandmother who had retired to Arizona 
20110110231748.000|20110110231751.000|TR0|from New Jersey -- 76-year-old church

20110110231753.000|20110110231756.000|TR0|wife from the bullets.  She was wounded,

20110110231758.000|20110110231801.000|TR0|
20110110231801.000|20110110231803.000|TR0|Dorothy Morris was also 76.  Her husband 
20110110231803.000|20110110231806.000|TR0|and high school sweetheart was wounded.  
20110110231806.000|20110110231808.000|TR0|And 30-year-old Gabe Zimmerman was a 
20110110231808.000|20110110231811.000|TR0|Giffords aide and organizer of the event.  
20110110231811.000|20110110231813.000|TR0|He was engaged to be married.

20110110231815.000|20110110231818.000|TR0|She was born in 2001, the little 
20110110231818.000|20110110231820.000|TR0|9-year-old little girl.  She was born in 
20110110231820.000|20110110231823.000|TR0|fact on 9/11.  Just want to make that 
20110110231823.000|20110110231825.000|TR0|clear.  She was not in 1991.  She was born 
20110110231825.000|20110110231828.000|TR0|in 2001.  That was Christina Taylor Green,

20110110231833.000|20110110231835.000|TR0|So, what would cause a gunman to go on a 
20110110231835.000|20110110231838.000|TR0|shooting rampage at a political rally?

20110110231858.000|20110110231900.000|TR0|Maybe, maybe, it was only a matter of 
20110110231900.000|20110110231903.000|TR0|time.  For the last two years, the 
20110110231903.000|20110110231905.000|TR0|political rhetoric in this country has 
20110110231905.000|20110110231908.000|TR0|gotten more hateful and angry and 
20110110231908.000|20110110231910.000|TR0|divisive.  We have seen guns at rallies 
20110110231910.000|20110110231913.000|TR0|and signs with nasty racist slogans.  And 
20110110231913.000|20110110231915.000|TR0|now we have this tragedy in Tucson.  Is 
20110110231915.000|20110110231917.000|TR0|there a link between this inflammatory 
20110110231917.000|20110110231920.000|TR0|rhetoric and the shooting of Congresswoman 
20110110231920.000|20110110231922.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords and 19 others?  Bet on 
20110110231922.000|20110110231925.000|TR0|it.       Several lawmakers from both 
20110110231925.000|20110110231927.000|TR0|sides of the isle are now calling for the 
20110110231927.000|20110110231930.000|TR0|political rhetoric to be toned down.  They 
20110110231930.000|20110110231932.000|TR0|say politicians need to cool it and to 
20110110231932.000|20110110231935.000|TR0|think about how our words affect people.  
20110110231935.000|20110110231937.000|TR0|There's an idea.
20110110231937.000|20110110231940.000|TR0|
20110110231940.000|20110110231942.000|TR0|This is happening at the same time that 
20110110231942.000|20110110231945.000|TR0|some of them are deciding to start 
20110110231945.000|20110110231947.000|TR0|carrying guns.  We talked about that in 
20110110231947.000|20110110231950.000|TR0|the last hour.  Many are pointing fingers 
20110110231950.000|20110110231952.000|TR0|at Sarah Palin, who makes incendiary and 
20110110231952.000|20110110231955.000|TR0|irresponsible comments with some 
20110110231955.000|20110110231957.000|TR0|regularity.  Palin once tweeted concerning 
20110110231957.000|20110110232000.000|TR0|the health care debate -- quote -- "Don't 
20110110232000.000|20110110232002.000|TR0|retreat. Instead, reload."
20110110232002.000|20110110232005.000|TR0|
20110110232005.000|20110110232007.000|TR0|She posted a map online before the midterm 
20110110232007.000|20110110232010.000|TR0|showing crosshairs of the kind you would 
20110110232010.000|20110110232012.000|TR0|see looking through a telescopic rifle 
20110110232012.000|20110110232015.000|TR0|sight over 20 contested Democratic 
20110110232015.000|20110110232017.000|TR0|districts, including Giffords'.  At the 
20110110232017.000|20110110232020.000|TR0|time, Congresswoman Giffords said -- quote 
20110110232020.000|20110110232022.000|TR0|-- "When people do that, they have got to 
20110110232022.000|20110110232024.000|TR0|realize that are consequences to that 
20110110232024.000|20110110232027.000|TR0|action" -- unquote.
20110110232027.000|20110110232029.000|TR0|
20110110232029.000|20110110232032.000|TR0|Well, since the shooting, Palin has 
20110110232032.000|20110110232034.000|TR0|expressed her condolences and says she 
20110110232034.000|20110110232037.000|TR0|hates violence.  The Tea Party movement, 
20110110232037.000|20110110232039.000|TR0|which has also been a cauldron of 
20110110232039.000|20110110232042.000|TR0|inflammatory rhetoric, is also distancing 
20110110232042.000|20110110232044.000|TR0|itself from the tragedy, condemning what 
20110110232044.000|20110110232047.000|TR0|happened.
20110110232047.000|20110110232049.000|TR0|
20110110232049.000|20110110232052.000|TR0|But even if there's no direct correlation 
20110110232052.000|20110110232054.000|TR0|here, people like Palin could bear some 
20110110232054.000|20110110232057.000|TR0|indirect responsibility for the mind-set 
20110110232057.000|20110110232059.000|TR0|of the shooter and others like him.
20110110232059.000|20110110232102.000|TR0|
20110110232102.000|20110110232104.000|TR0|Here's the question.  What can be done to 
20110110232104.000|20110110232107.000|TR0|tone down the hateful rhetoric in this 
20110110232107.000|20110110232109.000|TR0|country?

20110110232119.000|20110110232122.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I'm anxious to hear what our 
20110110232122.000|20110110232124.000|TR0|viewers think.  Jack, thanks for the 
20110110232124.000|20110110232126.000|TR0|question.
20110110232126.000|20110110232129.000|TR0|
20110110232129.000|20110110232131.000|TR0|The Arizona massacre could have been worse 
20110110232131.000|20110110232134.000|TR0|if bystanders hadn't jumped into action.  
20110110232134.000|20110110232136.000|TR0|But is there something they should have 
20110110232136.000|20110110232139.000|TR0|done differently?  And what would you have 
20110110232139.000|20110110232141.000|TR0|done?
20110110232141.000|20110110232144.000|TR0|
20110110232144.000|20110110232146.000|TR0|Also, he was in the hospital with 
20110110232146.000|20110110232149.000|TR0|Representative Giffords when she made her 
20110110232149.000|20110110232151.000|TR0|first movements.  A member of her 
20110110232151.000|20110110232154.000|TR0|congressional staff is standing by the

20110110232159.000|20110110232201.000|TR0|And you're looking at a live picture from 
20110110232201.000|20110110232204.000|TR0|outside the Tucson hospital where the 
20110110232204.000|20110110232206.000|TR0|congresswoman is recovering.  Flowers, 
20110110232206.000|20110110232209.000|TR0|candles, balloons, they are all marking 
20110110232209.000|20110110232211.000|TR0|the site.  We will have much more on the 
20110110232211.000|20110110232214.000|TR0|tragedy, the aftermath, and the political

20110110232224.000|20110110232226.000|TR0|BLITZER:  The slaughter in Tucson may have 
20110110232226.000|20110110232228.000|TR0|been even worse, if not for the heroic 
20110110232228.000|20110110232231.000|TR0|actions of bystanders who wrestled the 
20110110232231.000|20110110232233.000|TR0|suspect to the ground.  We just heard from 
20110110232233.000|20110110232236.000|TR0|one of those heroes.
20110110232236.000|20110110232238.000|TR0|
20110110232238.000|20110110232241.000|TR0|But what should you do if you're caught in 
20110110232241.000|20110110232243.000|TR0|a violent situation like this one?
20110110232243.000|20110110232246.000|TR0|
20110110232246.000|20110110232248.000|TR0|Brian Todd has been looking into this part 
20110110232248.000|20110110232251.000|TR0|of the story for us. I know you're 
20110110232251.000|20110110232253.000|TR0|speaking with experts.  What are you 
20110110232253.000|20110110232256.000|TR0|learning?
20110110232256.000|20110110232258.000|TR0|
20110110232258.000|20110110232301.000|TR0|BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Right.
20110110232301.000|20110110232303.000|TR0|
20110110232303.000|20110110232306.000|TR0|Well, Wolf, one law enforcement expert 
20110110232306.000|20110110232308.000|TR0|says for many of us the first reaction in 
20110110232308.000|20110110232311.000|TR0|these situations is just to freeze while 
20110110232311.000|20110110232313.000|TR0|you process what's happening.  The options 
20110110232313.000|20110110232316.000|TR0|for protecting yourself they say are 
20110110232316.000|20110110232318.000|TR0|limited and responding quickly is crucial.

20110110232328.000|20110110232331.000|TR0|authorities say the suspect was tackled by 
20110110232331.000|20110110232333.000|TR0|two men, while this woman, a diminutive 
20110110232333.000|20110110232335.000|TR0|61- year-old named Patricia Maisch, made 
20110110232335.000|20110110232338.000|TR0|another critical move.
20110110232338.000|20110110232340.000|TR0|
20110110232340.000|20110110232343.000|TR0|PATRICIA MAISCH, EYEWITNESS:  He was 
20110110232343.000|20110110232345.000|TR0|laying right next to me.  So I was able to 
20110110232345.000|20110110232348.000|TR0|just kneel up and was able to take the 
20110110232348.000|20110110232350.000|TR0|magazine away from him.  He had pulled it 
20110110232350.000|20110110232353.000|TR0|out of his pocket and it was on the 
20110110232353.000|20110110232355.000|TR0|ground.  He dropped it and I was able to 
20110110232355.000|20110110232358.000|TR0|get it before he did.

20110110232400.000|20110110232403.000|TR0|TODD:  Experts say it's clear those 
20110110232403.000|20110110232405.000|TR0|actions saved lives.  We asked them about 
20110110232405.000|20110110232408.000|TR0|the best way to minimize casualties in 
20110110232408.000|20110110232410.000|TR0|those crucial moments.

20110110232415.000|20110110232418.000|TR0|area if you're in a chaotic shooting 
20110110232418.000|20110110232420.000|TR0|situation?  I'm here with Bill Pickle.

20110110232435.000|20110110232437.000|TR0|Bill, let's say we're in this open plaza.  
20110110232437.000|20110110232440.000|TR0|There could be a shooter over by where 
20110110232440.000|20110110232442.000|TR0|these trees are or beyond them.  What's 
20110110232442.000|20110110232445.000|TR0|the best instinct, to drop and roll, maybe 
20110110232445.000|20110110232447.000|TR0|take cover behind a pillar here, and then 
20110110232447.000|20110110232450.000|TR0|take off?  What do you do?

20110110232455.000|20110110232457.000|TR0|SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: Well, I think you 
20110110232457.000|20110110232500.000|TR0|have answered part of it.  It's 
20110110232500.000|20110110232502.000|TR0|instinctive.

20110110232505.000|20110110232507.000|TR0|Everyone reacts differently, but if you're 
20110110232507.000|20110110232510.000|TR0|out in an area like this and you hear a 
20110110232510.000|20110110232512.000|TR0|shot or some type of violent action, the 
20110110232512.000|20110110232515.000|TR0|most immediate reaction is you freeze and 
20110110232515.000|20110110232517.000|TR0|then you want to flee.  You either want to 
20110110232517.000|20110110232520.000|TR0|take cover and/or flee.  Someone without 
20110110232520.000|20110110232522.000|TR0|any type of training to handle those 
20110110232522.000|20110110232525.000|TR0|situations, it's best to leave the area as 
20110110232525.000|20110110232527.000|TR0|quickly as possible.  Don't stay there and

20110110232532.000|20110110232535.000|TR0|TODD (voice-over):  What about protecting 
20110110232535.000|20110110232537.000|TR0|yourself with your own gun?  In the wake 
20110110232537.000|20110110232539.000|TR0|of the Tucson shootings, at least two 
20110110232539.000|20110110232542.000|TR0|members of Congress say they will start 
20110110232542.000|20110110232544.000|TR0|packing when they return to their home 
20110110232544.000|20110110232547.000|TR0|districts.

20110110232549.000|20110110232552.000|TR0|REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH:  I was a 
20110110232552.000|20110110232554.000|TR0|conceal carry permit holder before I was 
20110110232554.000|20110110232557.000|TR0|in Congress.  I have continued with that 
20110110232557.000|20110110232559.000|TR0|practice. And I will probably make it even 
20110110232559.000|20110110232602.000|TR0|more regular in my routine moving forward. 
20110110232602.000|20110110232604.000|TR0| It's just a personal security thing for 
20110110232604.000|20110110232607.000|TR0|me.  I think it's a smart thing.
20110110232607.000|20110110232609.000|TR0|
20110110232609.000|20110110232612.000|TR0|TODD:  And Democratic Congressman Heath 
20110110232612.000|20110110232614.000|TR0|Shuler is encouraging his staffers to get 
20110110232614.000|20110110232617.000|TR0|their own concealed carry permits.
20110110232617.000|20110110232619.000|TR0|
20110110232619.000|20110110232622.000|TR0|PICKLE:  You're going to have to ensure 
20110110232622.000|20110110232624.000|TR0|that they have gun safety, firearms 
20110110232624.000|20110110232627.000|TR0|training, and they have to have some kind 
20110110232627.000|20110110232629.000|TR0|of training in how to handle stressful or 
20110110232629.000|20110110232632.000|TR0|dangerous situations.  That's a tall order 
20110110232632.000|20110110232634.000|TR0|for a young staff person.

20110110232642.000|20110110232644.000|TR0|TODD:  Congressman Shuler and Jason 
20110110232644.000|20110110232646.000|TR0|Chaffetz both say they have received 
20110110232646.000|20110110232649.000|TR0|threats in the recent past.  Chaffetz is 
20110110232649.000|20110110232651.000|TR0|planning to introduce legislation calling 
20110110232651.000|20110110232654.000|TR0|for U.S. Marshals to protect members of 
20110110232654.000|20110110232656.000|TR0|Congress when they return to their home

20110110232701.000|20110110232704.000|TR0|Contacted by CNN, an official with the 
20110110232704.000|20110110232706.000|TR0|Marshals would not comment on that, other 
20110110232706.000|20110110232709.000|TR0|than to say that would require significant 
20110110232709.000|20110110232711.000|TR0|funding. Bill Pickle says a lot of these 
20110110232711.000|20110110232714.000|TR0|federal agencies just don't have the 
20110110232714.000|20110110232716.000|TR0|resources to do that -- Wolf.

20110110232719.000|20110110232721.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So, what do these experts say 
20110110232721.000|20110110232724.000|TR0|the best way members of Congress can 
20110110232724.000|20110110232726.000|TR0|protect themselves if they don't have 
20110110232726.000|20110110232729.000|TR0|Secret Service or U.S. Marshal protection?
20110110232729.000|20110110232731.000|TR0|
20110110232731.000|20110110232734.000|TR0|TODD:  Bill Pickle says there's an even 
20110110232734.000|20110110232736.000|TR0|better deterrent than those officers.  He 
20110110232736.000|20110110232739.000|TR0|says at these events if you take or 
20110110232739.000|20110110232741.000|TR0|request a local law enforcement officer, 
20110110232741.000|20110110232744.000|TR0|even just one, maybe a couple, to be there 
20110110232744.000|20110110232746.000|TR0|with uniforms on with cars nearby, he says 
20110110232746.000|20110110232748.000|TR0|that's a great deterrent for a lot of 
20110110232748.000|20110110232751.000|TR0|these people wanting to do harm.  And this 
20110110232751.000|20110110232753.000|TR0|is a Secret Service officer saying this.  
20110110232753.000|20110110232756.000|TR0|They have experience in this. The presence 
20110110232756.000|20110110232758.000|TR0|of those uniformed officers out there is a 
20110110232758.000|20110110232801.000|TR0|great deterrent.
20110110232801.000|20110110232803.000|TR0|
20110110232803.000|20110110232806.000|TR0|BLITZER:  In other words, just have a 
20110110232806.000|20110110232808.000|TR0|police officer outside either with a car 
20110110232808.000|20110110232811.000|TR0|very visible...

20110110232821.000|20110110232823.000|TR0|right.
20110110232823.000|20110110232826.000|TR0|
20110110232826.000|20110110232828.000|TR0|BLITZER:  That's a good idea.  All right, 
20110110232828.000|20110110232831.000|TR0|thanks very much, Brian, for that.

20110110232836.000|20110110232838.000|TR0|tragedy, you can imagine what

20110110233139.000|20110110233142.000|TR0|want to get too close. It's -- it's really 
20110110233142.000|20110110233144.000|TR0|hard.  I mean, I keep saying that, but 
20110110233144.000|20110110233147.000|TR0|it's really true.  For people who know and 
20110110233147.000|20110110233149.000|TR0|love Gabby, this event really hit close to

20110110233202.000|20110110233204.000|TR0|example, we opened our office at 8 a.m.  
20110110233204.000|20110110233206.000|TR0|We wanted to go about our duty as if 
20110110233206.000|20110110233209.000|TR0|everything were normal.  Of course, things 
20110110233209.000|20110110233211.000|TR0|are far from normal, but we know that 
20110110233211.000|20110110233214.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords would want us to 
20110110233214.000|20110110233216.000|TR0|open up our office and function as best as 
20110110233216.000|20110110233219.000|TR0|we can.  And that is exactly what we did.
20110110233219.000|20110110233221.000|TR0|
20110110233221.000|20110110233224.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I take it you were also there, 
20110110233224.000|20110110233226.000|TR0|C.J., when the doctors were inside, and 
20110110233226.000|20110110233229.000|TR0|they asked her to have some movement, 
20110110233229.000|20110110233231.000|TR0|movement of hand or whatever, and you saw 
20110110233231.000|20110110233234.000|TR0|her responding.  Talk a little bit about 
20110110233234.000|20110110233236.000|TR0|that.
20110110233236.000|20110110233239.000|TR0|
20110110233239.000|20110110233241.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Well, what happened was the 
20110110233241.000|20110110233244.000|TR0|doctors asked her to hold up two fingers.  
20110110233244.000|20110110233246.000|TR0|She -- the congresswoman held up two 
20110110233246.000|20110110233249.000|TR0|fingers. And it was -- as the doctors 
20110110233249.000|20110110233251.000|TR0|might have told you already, a very good 
20110110233251.000|20110110233254.000|TR0|sign.  For us in her office, it was -- 
20110110233254.000|20110110233256.000|TR0|sparked a little bit of a discussion.  Was 
20110110233256.000|20110110233259.000|TR0|she flashing the victory sign or the peace 
20110110233259.000|20110110233301.000|TR0|sign?  And we decided that it was -- it 
20110110233301.000|20110110233304.000|TR0|was both.
20110110233304.000|20110110233306.000|TR0|
20110110233306.000|20110110233308.000|TR0|BLITZER:  How are you personally dealing 
20110110233308.000|20110110233311.000|TR0|with this horrible situation?
20110110233311.000|20110110233313.000|TR0|
20110110233313.000|20110110233316.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Well, by staying busy, 
20110110233316.000|20110110233318.000|TR0|talking to you and others. We had our 
20110110233318.000|20110110233321.000|TR0|office open today.  People were coming in 
20110110233321.000|20110110233323.000|TR0|to pay their respects, dropping off 
20110110233323.000|20110110233326.000|TR0|flowers.  There's an impromptu shrine that 
20110110233326.000|20110110233328.000|TR0|was set up outside of our office, like 
20110110233328.000|20110110233331.000|TR0|there is a memorial here.  Candles, 
20110110233331.000|20110110233333.000|TR0|photos, notes, stuffed animals.  It's 
20110110233333.000|20110110233336.000|TR0|really quite touching.
20110110233336.000|20110110233338.000|TR0|
20110110233338.000|20110110233341.000|TR0|I think if -- if we stay focused on why we 
20110110233341.000|20110110233343.000|TR0|do what we do, the public service aspect 
20110110233343.000|20110110233346.000|TR0|of our lives, I think it's OK.  For me, 
20110110233346.000|20110110233348.000|TR0|it's OK.
20110110233348.000|20110110233351.000|TR0|
20110110233351.000|20110110233353.000|TR0|When we, our mind begins to think about 
20110110233353.000|20110110233356.000|TR0|other things, like the colleague that we 
20110110233356.000|20110110233358.000|TR0|lost, Gabe Zimmerman, it becomes very 
20110110233358.000|20110110233401.000|TR0|hard.  I left the office yesterday 
20110110233401.000|20110110233403.000|TR0|evening, just past 11.  And I drove past 
20110110233403.000|20110110233406.000|TR0|the memorial, and it was -- honestly, 
20110110233406.000|20110110233408.000|TR0|Wolf, it was hard to keep together. 
20110110233408.000|20110110233410.000|TR0|Because this was -- it's surreal.  It's a 
20110110233410.000|20110110233413.000|TR0|surreal experience.  And even two days 
20110110233413.000|20110110233415.000|TR0|later, it's still very difficult for us to 
20110110233415.000|20110110233418.000|TR0|come to grips with.
20110110233418.000|20110110233420.000|TR0|
20110110233420.000|20110110233423.000|TR0|BLITZER:  C.J., what can you tell us about 
20110110233423.000|20110110233425.000|TR0|what happened back in 2007?  The accused 
20110110233425.000|20110110233428.000|TR0|gunman, Jared Loughner, supposedly got 
20110110233428.000|20110110233430.000|TR0|some letter from your office.  He came to 
20110110233430.000|20110110233433.000|TR0|another event that the congresswoman was 
20110110233433.000|20110110233435.000|TR0|holding.  Talk a little bit about that.  
20110110233435.000|20110110233438.000|TR0|I'm sure you've gone back and reviewed it.
20110110233438.000|20110110233440.000|TR0|
20110110233440.000|20110110233443.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Yes.  Well, I can't give you 
20110110233443.000|20110110233445.000|TR0|too much detail about that specific event. 
20110110233445.000|20110110233448.000|TR0| I can tell you that, if someone attended 
20110110233448.000|20110110233450.000|TR0|a "Congress on Your Corner," they are 
20110110233450.000|20110110233453.000|TR0|asked to sign in.  And if they sign in, 
20110110233453.000|20110110233455.000|TR0|they probably got a letter thanking them 
20110110233455.000|20110110233458.000|TR0|for attending.  And that's standard 
20110110233458.000|20110110233500.000|TR0|practice in our office.
20110110233500.000|20110110233503.000|TR0|
20110110233503.000|20110110233505.000|TR0|We send a lot of thank-you notes at the 
20110110233505.000|20110110233508.000|TR0|congresswoman's request. It's very 
20110110233508.000|20110110233510.000|TR0|important to her that she close the circle 
20110110233510.000|20110110233513.000|TR0|and let people know who took the time out 
20110110233513.000|20110110233515.000|TR0|to speak to her, come to her events, write 
20110110233515.000|20110110233517.000|TR0|her, even interview her, the reporters 
20110110233517.000|20110110233520.000|TR0|sometimes get thank-you notes or thank-you 
20110110233520.000|20110110233522.000|TR0|calls or e-mails from Congresswoman 
20110110233522.000|20110110233525.000|TR0|Giffords.  Our office has a tracking 
20110110233525.000|20110110233527.000|TR0|system for thank-you notes, because they 
20110110233527.000|20110110233530.000|TR0|are very important to Congresswoman 
20110110233530.000|20110110233532.000|TR0|Giffords.
20110110233532.000|20110110233535.000|TR0|
20110110233535.000|20110110233537.000|TR0|But as to the specifics of this event, I 
20110110233537.000|20110110233540.000|TR0|-- or the incident that you spoke of, I 
20110110233540.000|20110110233542.000|TR0|can't go too much beyond what you already 
20110110233542.000|20110110233545.000|TR0|know.
20110110233545.000|20110110233547.000|TR0|
20110110233547.000|20110110233550.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Well, tell her family and when 
20110110233550.000|20110110233552.000|TR0|she wakes up, tell her we're all praying 
20110110233552.000|20110110233555.000|TR0|for her.  We're praying for the others who 
20110110233555.000|20110110233557.000|TR0|were injured.
20110110233557.000|20110110233600.000|TR0|
20110110233600.000|20110110233602.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Thank you, Wolf.
20110110233602.000|20110110233605.000|TR0|
20110110233605.000|20110110233607.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And certainly, our deepest 
20110110233607.000|20110110233610.000|TR0|condolences to all those killed, including 
20110110233610.000|20110110233612.000|TR0|your colleague, Gabe Zimmerman, who was 
20110110233612.000|20110110233615.000|TR0|only 30 years old.  He was about -- 
20110110233615.000|20110110233617.000|TR0|getting ready to get married, as well. 
20110110233617.000|20110110233619.000|TR0|What a sad story for everyone involved.  
20110110233619.000|20110110233622.000|TR0|C.J., thanks very much.
20110110233622.000|20110110233624.000|TR0|
20110110233624.000|20110110233627.000|TR0|KARAMARGIN:  Thank you, Wolf.
20110110233627.000|20110110233629.000|TR0|
20110110233629.000|20110110233632.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  Let's bring in 
20110110233632.000|20110110233634.000|TR0|Gloria Borger, our senior political 
20110110233634.000|20110110233637.000|TR0|analyst.  You wrote a column today about 
20110110233637.000|20110110233639.000|TR0|an e-mail that this congresswoman wrote to 
20110110233639.000|20110110233642.000|TR0|someone, what, just days earlier?
20110110233642.000|20110110233644.000|TR0|
20110110233644.000|20110110233647.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  The 
20110110233647.000|20110110233649.000|TR0|day before the shooting, Wolf, on Friday, 
20110110233649.000|20110110233652.000|TR0|she had gotten a notice in the mail from 
20110110233652.000|20110110233654.000|TR0|Trey Grayson.  You may remember him, 
20110110233654.000|20110110233657.000|TR0|secretary of state of Kentucky. He ran for 
20110110233657.000|20110110233659.000|TR0|the Senate on the Republican side.  Did 
20110110233659.000|20110110233702.000|TR0|not win.  He'd been appointed head of the 
20110110233702.000|20110110233704.000|TR0|Institute of Politics at Harvard.
20110110233704.000|20110110233707.000|TR0|
20110110233707.000|20110110233709.000|TR0|He sent out an e-mailing to his friends, 
20110110233709.000|20110110233712.000|TR0|and she wrote him back, congratulating 
20110110233712.000|20110110233714.000|TR0|him.  Let me quote from this e-mail.  She 
20110110233714.000|20110110233717.000|TR0|said to him, quote, "I would love to talk 
20110110233717.000|20110110233719.000|TR0|about we -- what we can do to promote 
20110110233719.000|20110110233722.000|TR0|centrism and moderation.  We need to 
20110110233722.000|20110110233724.000|TR0|figure out how to tone our rhetoric and 
20110110233724.000|20110110233726.000|TR0|partisanship down."  She was so prescient, 
20110110233726.000|20110110233729.000|TR0|Wolf, about the need to tone this down.
20110110233729.000|20110110233731.000|TR0|
20110110233731.000|20110110233734.000|TR0|Again, we have to keep saying, as we have 
20110110233734.000|20110110233736.000|TR0|all day today, we don't know anything 
20110110233736.000|20110110233739.000|TR0|about the politics of this shooter, other 
20110110233739.000|20110110233741.000|TR0|than to say, as we've just received word 
20110110233741.000|20110110233744.000|TR0|from the Pima County registrar that, in 
20110110233744.000|20110110233746.000|TR0|fact, he was registered as an independent. 
20110110233746.000|20110110233749.000|TR0| Not Democrat, not Republican.  
20110110233749.000|20110110233751.000|TR0|Independent.
20110110233751.000|20110110233754.000|TR0|
20110110233754.000|20110110233756.000|TR0|BLITZER:  The allegedly shooter in this 
20110110233756.000|20110110233759.000|TR0|case, Jared Loughner.
20110110233759.000|20110110233801.000|TR0|
20110110233801.000|20110110233804.000|TR0|BORGER:  Exactly.  Exactly.
20110110233804.000|20110110233806.000|TR0|
20110110233806.000|20110110233809.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So he didn't register as a 
20110110233809.000|20110110233811.000|TR0|Republican or a Democrat; he registered as 
20110110233811.000|20110110233814.000|TR0|an independent?
20110110233814.000|20110110233816.000|TR0|
20110110233816.000|20110110233819.000|TR0|BORGER:  That's right.  So you can't say 
20110110233819.000|20110110233821.000|TR0|-- you can't say where he came from 
20110110233821.000|20110110233824.000|TR0|politically.  We know -- we know that he's 
20110110233824.000|20110110233826.000|TR0|apparently unhinged, but we don't know 
20110110233826.000|20110110233828.000|TR0|what his politics are.  But we do know 
20110110233828.000|20110110233831.000|TR0|it's always good to talk about toning down 
20110110233831.000|20110110233833.000|TR0|the rhetoric.
20110110233833.000|20110110233836.000|TR0|
20110110233836.000|20110110233838.000|TR0|BLITZER:  How is the elected leadership 
20110110233838.000|20110110233841.000|TR0|dealing with this crisis?
20110110233841.000|20110110233843.000|TR0|
20110110233843.000|20110110233846.000|TR0|BORGER:  Well, you know, I think it's 
20110110233846.000|20110110233848.000|TR0|interesting.  Because I think they've 
20110110233848.000|20110110233851.000|TR0|really risen to the occasion.  And you 
20110110233851.000|20110110233853.000|TR0|have a new speaker of the House, John 
20110110233853.000|20110110233856.000|TR0|Boehner, came out, gave a statement 
20110110233856.000|20110110233858.000|TR0|immediately.  You haven't seen him 
20110110233858.000|20110110233901.000|TR0|everywhere else.  Took care of his flock 
20110110233901.000|20110110233903.000|TR0|in the Congress.  Had an unprecedented 
20110110233903.000|20110110233906.000|TR0|bipartisan conference call with over 800 
20110110233906.000|20110110233908.000|TR0|people on -- staffers, members of Congress 
20110110233908.000|20110110233911.000|TR0|-- about security.
20110110233911.000|20110110233913.000|TR0|
20110110233913.000|20110110233916.000|TR0|The moment of silence on the steps of the 
20110110233916.000|20110110233918.000|TR0|House -- of the Congress.  And also 
20110110233918.000|20110110233921.000|TR0|deciding, and I think rightly so not to 
20110110233921.000|20110110233923.000|TR0|take up the very contentious repeal of 
20110110233923.000|20110110233926.000|TR0|health-care reform this week, rather to 
20110110233926.000|20110110233928.000|TR0|put it off.
20110110233928.000|20110110233930.000|TR0|
20110110233930.000|20110110233933.000|TR0|And again, Barack Obama also speaking to 
20110110233933.000|20110110233935.000|TR0|the American public immediately.  I would 
20110110233935.000|20110110233938.000|TR0|not be surprised, Wolf, if we hear more 
20110110233938.000|20110110233940.000|TR0|from Barack Obama about this, either in 
20110110233940.000|20110110233943.000|TR0|the near future or in his State of the 
20110110233943.000|20110110233945.000|TR0|Union.
20110110233945.000|20110110233948.000|TR0|
20110110233948.000|20110110233950.000|TR0|BLITZER:  A lot of people have looked at 
20110110233950.000|20110110233953.000|TR0|the map targeting her districts, some 
20110110233953.000|20110110233955.000|TR0|other Democratic districts, that Sarah 
20110110233955.000|20110110233958.000|TR0|Palin put out. But I take it the Democrats 
20110110233958.000|20110110234000.000|TR0|also had a map showing some targeted 
20110110234000.000|20110110234003.000|TR0|districts.
20110110234003.000|20110110234005.000|TR0|
20110110234005.000|20110110234008.000|TR0|BORGER:  Yes.  And this has been a real 
20110110234008.000|20110110234010.000|TR0|bone of contention between Democrats and 
20110110234010.000|20110110234013.000|TR0|Republicans.  You see -- see this map up 
20110110234013.000|20110110234015.000|TR0|there that was used by Democrats, and I 
20110110234015.000|20110110234018.000|TR0|believe it was...
20110110234018.000|20110110234020.000|TR0|
20110110234020.000|20110110234023.000|TR0|BLITZER:  2004.
20110110234023.000|20110110234025.000|TR0|
20110110234025.000|20110110234028.000|TR0|BORGER:  ... in the 2004 election.  It 
20110110234028.000|20110110234030.000|TR0|talks about enemies.  It talks about 
20110110234030.000|20110110234033.000|TR0|targets.  It has bulls-eyes.
20110110234033.000|20110110234035.000|TR0|
20110110234035.000|20110110234037.000|TR0|So I think what we see here, Wolf, is that 
20110110234037.000|20110110234040.000|TR0|nobody has the moral high ground here.  
20110110234040.000|20110110234042.000|TR0|These are the words we use in elections, 
20110110234042.000|20110110234045.000|TR0|OK?  And there is nobody -- nobody who's 
20110110234045.000|20110110234047.000|TR0|got the corner on saying, "I'm holier than 
20110110234047.000|20110110234050.000|TR0|thou, and I've never used this kind of 
20110110234050.000|20110110234052.000|TR0|language."
20110110234052.000|20110110234055.000|TR0|
20110110234055.000|20110110234057.000|TR0|What we can say, though, Wolf, is that I 
20110110234057.000|20110110234100.000|TR0|think the test of leadership in the future 
20110110234100.000|20110110234102.000|TR0|is going to be the test of somebody who 
20110110234102.000|20110110234105.000|TR0|can actually talk to voters and calm down 
20110110234105.000|20110110234107.000|TR0|the rhetoric, rather than ratchet it up.
20110110234107.000|20110110234110.000|TR0|
20110110234110.000|20110110234112.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Thanks.  Good -- good point, 
20110110234112.000|20110110234115.000|TR0|Gloria, as usual. Appreciate it.
20110110234115.000|20110110234117.000|TR0|
20110110234117.000|20110110234120.000|TR0|BORGER:  Thank you.

20110110234122.000|20110110234125.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Jack Cafferty has more on this.  
20110110234125.000|20110110234127.000|TR0|He's asking what could be done to tone 
20110110234127.000|20110110234130.000|TR0|down the hateful rhetoric in the country.  
20110110234130.000|20110110234132.000|TR0|Jack is standing by with your e-mail.  I'm 
20110110234132.000|20110110234135.000|TR0|anxious to hear what you think.

20110110234137.000|20110110234139.000|TR0|Plus, a former House majority leader now 
20110110234139.000|20110110234142.000|TR0|facing prison time.  We have details of 
20110110234142.000|20110110234144.000|TR0|the sentencing of Tom DeLay.

20110110234152.000|20110110234154.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We'll get back to the Tucson 
20110110234154.000|20110110234157.000|TR0|shooting shortly.  But he was once one of 
20110110234157.000|20110110234159.000|TR0|the most powerful Republicans.  Now Tom 
20110110234159.000|20110110234202.000|TR0|DeLay is facing prison.  CNN's Ed 
20110110234202.000|20110110234204.000|TR0|Lavandera is joining us now from Texas 
20110110234204.000|20110110234207.000|TR0|with the latest.
20110110234207.000|20110110234209.000|TR0|
20110110234209.000|20110110234212.000|TR0|Ed, what happened?
20110110234212.000|20110110234214.000|TR0|
20110110234214.000|20110110234217.000|TR0|ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110110234217.000|20110110234219.000|TR0|Wolf, just a short while ago, literally 
20110110234219.000|20110110234222.000|TR0|seconds ago, Tom DeLay left the Travis 
20110110234222.000|20110110234224.000|TR0|County jail where he has been booked.  He 
20110110234224.000|20110110234227.000|TR0|was sentenced today by a judge here in 
20110110234227.000|20110110234229.000|TR0|Austin, Texas, to three years in prison.  
20110110234229.000|20110110234232.000|TR0|Plus, he'll have extended probation time 
20110110234232.000|20110110234234.000|TR0|after that.  But he has been allowed to 
20110110234234.000|20110110234237.000|TR0|post bond while the case is under appeal.
20110110234237.000|20110110234239.000|TR0|
20110110234239.000|20110110234241.000|TR0|A very angry Tom DeLay as he left the jail 
20110110234241.000|20110110234244.000|TR0|here in Austin.  Even his attorney 
20110110234244.000|20110110234246.000|TR0|extremely angry.     Essentially, Tom 
20110110234246.000|20110110234249.000|TR0|DeLay was convicted back in November, 
20110110234249.000|20110110234251.000|TR0|found guilty of money laundering and 
20110110234251.000|20110110234254.000|TR0|conspiracy, essentially accused of 
20110110234254.000|20110110234256.000|TR0|funneling $190,000 in corporate money 
20110110234256.000|20110110234259.000|TR0|through various PACs into Republican 
20110110234259.000|20110110234301.000|TR0|candidates running for the state 
20110110234301.000|20110110234304.000|TR0|legislature here in Texas. That's where 
20110110234304.000|20110110234306.000|TR0|these charges stem from.
20110110234306.000|20110110234309.000|TR0|
20110110234309.000|20110110234311.000|TR0|Of course, as you mentioned, Wolf, Tom 
20110110234311.000|20110110234314.000|TR0|DeLay was once one of the most powerful 
20110110234314.000|20110110234316.000|TR0|Republicans in the country, doing work 
20110110234316.000|20110110234319.000|TR0|here in Texas to make sure that more and 
20110110234319.000|20110110234321.000|TR0|more Republicans would get elected from 
20110110234321.000|20110110234324.000|TR0|the state of Texas.  He made no excuses 
20110110234324.000|20110110234326.000|TR0|for that today when he spoke in front of 
20110110234326.000|20110110234329.000|TR0|the judge, saying that he believed in his 
20110110234329.000|20110110234331.000|TR0|conservative politics that he does not 
20110110234331.000|20110110234334.000|TR0|believe he did anything wrong.
20110110234334.000|20110110234336.000|TR0|
20110110234336.000|20110110234339.000|TR0|This sentence handed down by the judge 
20110110234339.000|20110110234341.000|TR0|came as an extreme shock to not only him 
20110110234341.000|20110110234344.000|TR0|but his attorney as well, who had very few 
20110110234344.000|20110110234346.000|TR0|words as he left the courthouse here this 
20110110234346.000|20110110234348.000|TR0|afternoon.

20110110234358.000|20110110234401.000|TR0|If I told you what I thought, I'd get 
20110110234401.000|20110110234403.000|TR0|sued.  This will not stand.  Thank you.

20110110234413.000|20110110234416.000|TR0|had to say.  We thought that Dick -- that 
20110110234416.000|20110110234418.000|TR0|Tom DeLay would have some comments to say 
20110110234418.000|20110110234421.000|TR0|after he posted bond here just a short 
20110110234421.000|20110110234423.000|TR0|while ago, but he refused to answer any 
20110110234423.000|20110110234426.000|TR0|questions.

20110110234431.000|20110110234433.000|TR0|very happy with the verdict, that they 
20110110234433.000|20110110234436.000|TR0|believe it was a fair sentence that has 
20110110234436.000|20110110234438.000|TR0|been handed down by this judge.  And they 
20110110234438.000|20110110234441.000|TR0|say it should send a message to all

20110110234453.000|20110110234455.000|TR0|ATTORNEY:  I think the message of this 
20110110234455.000|20110110234458.000|TR0|case is very clear and has been from the 
20110110234458.000|20110110234500.000|TR0|very first day.  Corporate contributions 
20110110234500.000|20110110234503.000|TR0|in Texas are illegal.  And you can't give 
20110110234503.000|20110110234505.000|TR0|corporate money to a candidate directly, 
20110110234505.000|20110110234508.000|TR0|and you can't give it indirectly.  That's 
20110110234508.000|20110110234510.000|TR0|been the message all along.

20110110234518.000|20110110234520.000|TR0|LAVANDERA;  So, Wolf, an amazing turn of 
20110110234520.000|20110110234523.000|TR0|events here today in Austin as -- as once 
20110110234523.000|20110110234525.000|TR0|one of the most powerful Republicans in 
20110110234525.000|20110110234528.000|TR0|this country, Tom DeLay, now facing the 
20110110234528.000|20110110234530.000|TR0|very serious likelihood that he could be 
20110110234530.000|20110110234533.000|TR0|spending up to three years in prison.
20110110234533.000|20110110234535.000|TR0|
20110110234535.000|20110110234538.000|TR0|He will remain out.  And his attorneys say 
20110110234538.000|20110110234540.000|TR0|that -- they have been saying all along 
20110110234540.000|20110110234543.000|TR0|that they believe this is a complete 
20110110234543.000|20110110234545.000|TR0|miscarriage of justice, do not feel that 
20110110234545.000|20110110234548.000|TR0|this verdict and the guilty verdicts were 
20110110234548.000|20110110234550.000|TR0|safe.  And they will continue to fight 
20110110234550.000|20110110234553.000|TR0|hard on appeal.  So it will be interesting 
20110110234553.000|20110110234555.000|TR0|to see how this plays out over the months 
20110110234555.000|20110110234557.000|TR0|and years ahead -- Wolf.

20110110234615.000|20110110234617.000|TR0|Palin, the former Alaska governor, also a 
20110110234617.000|20110110234620.000|TR0|reality television star.  But guess what?  
20110110234620.000|20110110234622.000|TR0|Maybe -- maybe not for long.

20110110234652.000|20110110234655.000|TR0|He was there, brought to that federal --

20110110234749.000|20110110234752.000|TR0| Very disturbing and very bizarre, Wolf.  
20110110234752.000|20110110234754.000|TR0|Ashley Turton was the wife of White House 
20110110234754.000|20110110234757.000|TR0|aide Dan Turton.  Firefighters found her 
20110110234757.000|20110110234759.000|TR0|body inside her vehicle, which was burning 
20110110234759.000|20110110234801.000|TR0|inside the garage of her family's Capitol 
20110110234801.000|20110110234804.000|TR0|Hill home around 5 a.m. this morning.  The 
20110110234804.000|20110110234806.000|TR0|fire did not spread, and Turton's husband 
20110110234806.000|20110110234809.000|TR0|and three young children were not hurt.

20110110234816.000|20110110234819.000|TR0| NASA's Kepler Space Telescope made the

20110110234821.000|20110110234824.000|TR0|ever discovered outside our solar system.  
20110110234824.000|20110110234826.000|TR0|It's just under 1 1/2 times the size of 
20110110234826.000|20110110234829.000|TR0|earth.  But before you get too excited, 
20110110234829.000|20110110234831.000|TR0|scientists say it's too close to its star 
20110110234831.000|20110110234834.000|TR0|to support life.

20110110234839.000|20110110234841.000|TR0|be a one-season wonder.  "Entertainment 
20110110234841.000|20110110234844.000|TR0|Weekly" is reporting that producer Mark

20110110234851.000|20110110234854.000|TR0|reason was given, and TLC would not 
20110110234854.000|20110110234856.000|TR0|confirm the reports to CNN.  But the 
20110110234856.000|20110110234859.000|TR0|magazine notes that there could be 
20110110234859.000|20110110234901.000|TR0|equal-time issues, you know, if Palin 
20110110234901.000|20110110234904.000|TR0|decides to run for president, Wolf.

20110110234916.000|20110110234918.000|TR0|SYLVESTER:  I was going to say.  It would 
20110110234918.000|20110110234921.000|TR0|go on and on     BLITZER:  ... and Mitt 
20110110234921.000|20110110234923.000|TR0|Romney have "Mitt Romney's Massachusetts" 
20110110234923.000|20110110234926.000|TR0|or New Hampshire, where he's living right 
20110110234926.000|20110110234928.000|TR0|now.  So they'd have to do a lot of those
