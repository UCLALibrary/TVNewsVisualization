20110110220007.000|20110110220009.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  Brooke, thanks 
20110110220009.000|20110110220011.000|TR0|very much.
20110110220011.000|20110110220014.000|TR0|
20110110220014.000|20110110220016.000|TR0|Happening now, the accused assassin in 
20110110220016.000|20110110220019.000|TR0|court and breaking his silence in the 
20110110220019.000|20110110220021.000|TR0|deadly mass shooting in Arizona.  Stand by 
20110110220021.000|20110110220024.000|TR0|for the newest information about his 
20110110220024.000|20110110220026.000|TR0|troubled life and why he allegedly 
20110110220026.000|20110110220029.000|TR0|targeted U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110110220029.000|20110110220031.000|TR0|Giffords.
20110110220031.000|20110110220034.000|TR0|
20110110220034.000|20110110220036.000|TR0|The president and members of both parties 
20110110220036.000|20110110220039.000|TR0|joining together in silence, shock and 
20110110220039.000|20110110220041.000|TR0|grief.  Mr. Obama offering new comments 
20110110220041.000|20110110220044.000|TR0|today about the tragedy.  We're plugged 
20110110220044.000|20110110220046.000|TR0|into the debate over angry partisan 
20110110220046.000|20110110220049.000|TR0|politics and whether this shooting will 
20110110220049.000|20110110220051.000|TR0|change anything.
20110110220051.000|20110110220054.000|TR0|
20110110220054.000|20110110220056.000|TR0|And one big question for so many lawmakers 
20110110220056.000|20110110220059.000|TR0|right now -- does this act of violence 
20110110220059.000|20110110220101.000|TR0|expose dangerous holes in America's gun 
20110110220101.000|20110110220104.000|TR0|laws and in security for government 
20110110220104.000|20110110220106.000|TR0|officials?
20110110220106.000|20110110220109.000|TR0|
20110110220109.000|20110110220111.000|TR0|I'm Wolf Blitzer.
20110110220111.000|20110110220114.000|TR0|
20110110220114.000|20110110220116.000|TR0|You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.
20110110220116.000|20110110220119.000|TR0|
20110110220119.000|20110110220121.000|TR0|Twenty-two-year-old Jared Loughner now 
20110110220121.000|20110110220124.000|TR0|seems fully aware of the heinous charges 
20110110220124.000|20110110220126.000|TR0|he faces in the mass shooting in Arizona 
20110110220126.000|20110110220128.000|TR0|that killed six people and left a United 
20110110220128.000|20110110220131.000|TR0|States Congresswoman fighting for her 
20110110220131.000|20110110220133.000|TR0|life.  Loughner appearing in an Arizona 
20110110220133.000|20110110220136.000|TR0|courtroom just a short while ago.
20110110220136.000|20110110220138.000|TR0|
20110110220138.000|20110110220141.000|TR0|Doctors now say Representative Gabrielle 
20110110220141.000|20110110220143.000|TR0|Giffords' condition has stabilized but 
20110110220143.000|20110110220146.000|TR0|still is critical after a bullet store 
20110110220146.000|20110110220148.000|TR0|through her brain.
20110110220148.000|20110110220151.000|TR0|
20110110220151.000|20110110220153.000|TR0|President Obama says Americans are pulling 
20110110220153.000|20110110220156.000|TR0|together after the shooting.  He led a 
20110110220156.000|20110110220158.000|TR0|moment of silence today silence today for 
20110110220158.000|20110110220201.000|TR0|the victims.
20110110220201.000|20110110220203.000|TR0|
20110110220203.000|20110110220206.000|TR0|We've seen reports that the shooting 
20110110220206.000|20110110220208.000|TR0|suspect, Jared Loughner, had not been 
20110110220208.000|20110110220211.000|TR0|talking to police.  But it appears he 
20110110220211.000|20110110220213.000|TR0|broke his silence in court today.
20110110220213.000|20110110220216.000|TR0|
20110110220216.000|20110110220218.000|TR0|CNN's Ted Rowlands covered the court 
20110110220218.000|20110110220221.000|TR0|appearance in Phoenix.
20110110220221.000|20110110220223.000|TR0|
20110110220223.000|20110110220226.000|TR0|He's joining us now on the phone -- walk 
20110110220226.000|20110110220228.000|TR0|us through, Ted, what happened when he 
20110110220228.000|20110110220231.000|TR0|walked into that courtroom. TED ROWLANDS, 
20110110220231.000|20110110220233.000|TR0|CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, he walked 
20110110220233.000|20110110220236.000|TR0|in chains. Both his legs and his arms were 
20110110220236.000|20110110220238.000|TR0|chained.  He was in a tan prison clothed 
20110110220238.000|20110110220241.000|TR0|suit.  And he first looked up to the 
20110110220241.000|20110110220243.000|TR0|ceiling.  His eyes were darting around.  
20110110220243.000|20110110220245.000|TR0|He seemed nervous.  Then he sat with his 
20110110220245.000|20110110220248.000|TR0|attorney, Judy Clarke, for a while, before 
20110110220248.000|20110110220250.000|TR0|the judge took the bench.  And you could 
20110110220250.000|20110110220253.000|TR0|tell that he was listening to what she was 
20110110220253.000|20110110220255.000|TR0|saying and nodding. So he was definitely 
20110110220255.000|20110110220258.000|TR0|-- you could tell early on that he was 
20110110220258.000|20110110220300.000|TR0|understanding the proceedings.
20110110220300.000|20110110220303.000|TR0|
20110110220303.000|20110110220305.000|TR0|And then when the judge took the bench, it 
20110110220305.000|20110110220308.000|TR0|was very clear that he understood 
20110110220308.000|20110110220310.000|TR0|everything.  And he was very succinct and 
20110110220310.000|20110110220313.000|TR0|very clear in his diction.  He answered 
20110110220313.000|20110110220315.000|TR0|every question the judge had -- in fact, 
20110110220315.000|20110110220318.000|TR0|the first thing the judge said after he 
20110110220318.000|20110110220320.000|TR0|took the bench was, "Are you Jared Lee 
20110110220320.000|20110110220323.000|TR0|Loughner?"
20110110220323.000|20110110220325.000|TR0|
20110110220325.000|20110110220328.000|TR0|And Loughner sort of paused and -- and 
20110110220328.000|20110110220330.000|TR0|leaned into the microphone. And then, in a 
20110110220330.000|20110110220333.000|TR0|very strong voice said, "Yes, I am Jared 
20110110220333.000|20110110220335.000|TR0|Lee Loughner."
20110110220335.000|20110110220338.000|TR0|
20110110220338.000|20110110220340.000|TR0|From there, the judge went through all of 
20110110220340.000|20110110220343.000|TR0|the counts.  And each and every time that 
20110110220343.000|20110110220345.000|TR0|Loughner was asked a question by this 
20110110220345.000|20110110220348.000|TR0|judge, he clearly answered it either a yes 
20110110220348.000|20110110220350.000|TR0|or no or whatever was appropriate.
20110110220350.000|20110110220353.000|TR0|
20110110220353.000|20110110220355.000|TR0|At one point, he was asked did -- did 
20110110220355.000|20110110220358.000|TR0|Miss. Clarke, his lawyer, help him fill 
20110110220358.000|20110110220400.000|TR0|out a form.  And he said, "Yes, Miss. 
20110110220400.000|20110110220402.000|TR0|Clarke did help me fill it out."
20110110220402.000|20110110220405.000|TR0|
20110110220405.000|20110110220407.000|TR0|So, clearly, he understands what's going 
20110110220407.000|20110110220410.000|TR0|on.  And we didn't know what to expect in 
20110110220410.000|20110110220412.000|TR0|court, but what we got was a very young 
20110110220412.000|20110110220415.000|TR0|man, head shaven, in shackles, answering 
20110110220415.000|20110110220417.000|TR0|very politely to this judge.
20110110220417.000|20110110220420.000|TR0|
20110110220420.000|20110110220422.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And you were only a few feet 
20110110220422.000|20110110220425.000|TR0|away, Ted.  But you said earlier his -- 
20110110220425.000|20110110220427.000|TR0|what, his eyes were darting around, he 
20110110220427.000|20110110220430.000|TR0|appeared nervous.
20110110220430.000|20110110220432.000|TR0|
20110110220432.000|20110110220435.000|TR0|Walk us through a little bit of what he 
20110110220435.000|20110110220437.000|TR0|looked like.
20110110220437.000|20110110220440.000|TR0|
20110110220440.000|20110110220442.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Well, I was probably about two 
20110110220442.000|20110110220445.000|TR0|feet away from him, because I was in the 
20110110220445.000|20110110220447.000|TR0|front row.  So he -- when he came out of 
20110110220447.000|20110110220450.000|TR0|the entrance to the courtroom where 
20110110220450.000|20110110220452.000|TR0|there's a jail cell set up -- they'd 
20110110220452.000|20110110220455.000|TR0|opened the door and you could actually see 
20110110220455.000|20110110220457.000|TR0|inside.  And I could see the jail cell and 
20110110220457.000|20110110220500.000|TR0|then -- and then they brought him in.
20110110220500.000|20110110220502.000|TR0|
20110110220502.000|20110110220505.000|TR0|When they first brought him into the 
20110110220505.000|20110110220507.000|TR0|courtroom, he did look around a little 
20110110220507.000|20110110220510.000|TR0|bit.  And he was darting his eyes back and 
20110110220510.000|20110110220512.000|TR0|forth very rapidly. And then he looked up 
20110110220512.000|20110110220515.000|TR0|sort of to the ceiling, until he was led 
20110110220515.000|20110110220517.000|TR0|to the chair, where he sat and sort of 
20110110220517.000|20110110220519.000|TR0|settled down.
20110110220519.000|20110110220522.000|TR0|
20110110220522.000|20110110220524.000|TR0|I think it was just nerves, what we were 
20110110220524.000|20110110220527.000|TR0|seeing there, because after his lawyer sat 
20110110220527.000|20110110220529.000|TR0|next to him and talked to him, he seemed 
20110110220529.000|20110110220532.000|TR0|to settle down.  He was very rigid 
20110110220532.000|20110110220534.000|TR0|throughout the whole process.  But from 
20110110220534.000|20110110220537.000|TR0|there, he answered every question very 
20110110220537.000|20110110220539.000|TR0|clearly and to the -- every question the 
20110110220539.000|20110110220542.000|TR0|judge had.
20110110220542.000|20110110220544.000|TR0|
20110110220544.000|20110110220547.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And -- and you said he was -- he 
20110110220547.000|20110110220549.000|TR0|was bald, if you will, he had a shaven 
20110110220549.000|20110110220552.000|TR0|head?
20110110220552.000|20110110220554.000|TR0|
20110110220554.000|20110110220557.000|TR0|Because the picture we've been showing our 
20110110220557.000|20110110220559.000|TR0|viewers shows he's got a lot of hair.
20110110220559.000|20110110220602.000|TR0|
20110110220602.000|20110110220604.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Yes, he was -- his head was 
20110110220604.000|20110110220607.000|TR0|shaved.  He looked like he had some 
20110110220607.000|20110110220609.000|TR0|bruises, most likely from the scuffle 
20110110220609.000|20110110220612.000|TR0|following the shooting rampage, when he 
20110110220612.000|20110110220614.000|TR0|was pinned down to the ground for an 
20110110220614.000|20110110220617.000|TR0|extended period of time.  But he -- yes, 
20110110220617.000|20110110220619.000|TR0|his head was completely shaven and unlike 
20110110220619.000|20110110220622.000|TR0|the photos that we've seen where, of 
20110110220622.000|20110110220624.000|TR0|course, he -- he had -- he had lots of 
20110110220624.000|20110110220627.000|TR0|hair.
20110110220627.000|20110110220629.000|TR0|
20110110220629.000|20110110220632.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Did -- and what was he wearing 
20110110220632.000|20110110220634.000|TR0|in this brief court appearance?
20110110220634.000|20110110220636.000|TR0|
20110110220636.000|20110110220639.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  He was wearing the prison 
20110110220639.000|20110110220641.000|TR0|outfit.  It was in -- it was a tan-colored 
20110110220641.000|20110110220644.000|TR0|prison outfit.  And he had chains not only 
20110110220644.000|20110110220646.000|TR0|on his arms, but also on his legs.  So he 
20110110220646.000|20110110220649.000|TR0|sort of shuffled around the courtroom. 
20110110220649.000|20110110220651.000|TR0|They first moved him to a table and then 
20110110220651.000|20110110220654.000|TR0|he had to move up to a podium when the 
20110110220654.000|20110110220656.000|TR0|judge took the bench.
20110110220656.000|20110110220659.000|TR0|
20110110220659.000|20110110220701.000|TR0|One interesting note.  When the judge went 
20110110220701.000|20110110220704.000|TR0|through all the charges -- and he went 
20110110220704.000|20110110220706.000|TR0|through them one by one, not only listing 
20110110220706.000|20110110220709.000|TR0|the charge, but also the possible penalty. 
20110110220709.000|20110110220711.000|TR0| When he listed the charge of murder in 
20110110220711.000|20110110220714.000|TR0|the first degree in the death of
20110110220714.000|20110110220716.000|TR0|
20110110220716.000|20110110220719.000|TR0|John Roll, a U.S. district judge, to me, 
20110110220719.000|20110110220721.000|TR0|it seemed like this judge on the bench, 
20110110220721.000|20110110220724.000|TR0|Judge Anderson, paused rather dramatically 
20110110220724.000|20110110220726.000|TR0|to emphasize that he was announcing the 
20110110220726.000|20110110220729.000|TR0|death of one of his colleagues, another 
20110110220729.000|20110110220731.000|TR0|federal judge down in Tucson.  And it was 
20110110220731.000|20110110220734.000|TR0|a very dramatic moment.  And maybe I 
20110110220734.000|20110110220736.000|TR0|overanalyzed it, but that's what I took 
20110110220736.000|20110110220739.000|TR0|from being in the court out -- in the 
20110110220739.000|20110110220741.000|TR0|courtroom.
20110110220741.000|20110110220744.000|TR0|
20110110220744.000|20110110220746.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And so you didn't get any 
20110110220746.000|20110110220749.000|TR0|impression, based on this brief court 
20110110220749.000|20110110220751.000|TR0|appearance, of someone who was crazy or 
20110110220751.000|20110110220753.000|TR0|psychotic or a lunatic.
20110110220753.000|20110110220756.000|TR0|
20110110220756.000|20110110220758.000|TR0|At least on the surface he seemed 
20110110220758.000|20110110220801.000|TR0|relatively normal, is that what I'm 
20110110220801.000|20110110220803.000|TR0|hearing from you, Ted?
20110110220803.000|20110110220806.000|TR0|
20110110220806.000|20110110220808.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  He 
20110110220808.000|20110110220811.000|TR0|followed orders and -- and he conducted 
20110110220811.000|20110110220813.000|TR0|himself with courtesy, really, in -- in 
20110110220813.000|20110110220816.000|TR0|the courtroom.  And we, of course, had no 
20110110220816.000|20110110220818.000|TR0|idea what to expect, because we had heard 
20110110220818.000|20110110220821.000|TR0|that he was not talking to authorities.  
20110110220821.000|20110110220823.000|TR0|And we had heard that he had disrupted his 
20110110220823.000|20110110220826.000|TR0|college classroom over the last few years. 
20110110220826.000|20110110220828.000|TR0| So we were really interested to see how 
20110110220828.000|20110110220831.000|TR0|he would handle himself.  And -- and he 
20110110220831.000|20110110220833.000|TR0|not only understood what was going on, but 
20110110220833.000|20110110220836.000|TR0|he conducted himself in a manner which was 
20110110220836.000|20110110220838.000|TR0|much different than you might think 
20110110220838.000|20110110220841.000|TR0|somebody who was capable of what he did on 
20110110220841.000|20110110220843.000|TR0|Saturday -- or allegedly did on Saturday 
20110110220843.000|20110110220846.000|TR0|morning -- would have handled himself the 
20110110220846.000|20110110220848.000|TR0|way in which he did.  It was a -- it was a 
20110110220848.000|20110110220851.000|TR0|little bit -- it was a little bit 
20110110220851.000|20110110220853.000|TR0|different than, personally, I thought we 
20110110220853.000|20110110220856.000|TR0|were going to see in court today.  He 
20110110220856.000|20110110220858.000|TR0|seemed like a young man that definitely 
20110110220858.000|20110110220901.000|TR0|understood everything and was very clear 
20110110220901.000|20110110220903.000|TR0|in his answers to the judge.
20110110220903.000|20110110220906.000|TR0|
20110110220906.000|20110110220908.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Ted Rowlands reporting for us.
20110110220908.000|20110110220911.000|TR0|
20110110220911.000|20110110220913.000|TR0|All right, Ted, thanks very much.

20110110220920.000|20110110220923.000|TR0|recovering from this horrific shooting. 
20110110220923.000|20110110220925.000|TR0|Our national political correspondent, 
20110110220925.000|20110110220928.000|TR0|Jessica Yellin, is in Tucson, where they, 
20110110220928.000|20110110220930.000|TR0|earlier in the day, gave an update on her 
20110110220930.000|20110110220933.000|TR0|condition -- update our viewers, Jessica, 
20110110220933.000|20110110220935.000|TR0|on what -- what we know about her

20110110220943.000|20110110220945.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, the Congresswoman's 
20110110220945.000|20110110220948.000|TR0|neurosurgeon says that her condition 
20110110220948.000|20110110220950.000|TR0|essentially has not changed since 
20110110220950.000|20110110220953.000|TR0|yesterday.  And that is excellent news.  
20110110220953.000|20110110220955.000|TR0|He explains that in conditions like this, 
20110110220955.000|20110110220958.000|TR0|you want the patient to remain in as good 
20110110220958.000|20110110221000.000|TR0|shape as she has been.  And they say they 
20110110221000.000|20110110221003.000|TR0|do daily C.T. scans and they've seen no 
20110110221003.000|20110110221005.000|TR0|change.
20110110221005.000|20110110221008.000|TR0|
20110110221008.000|20110110221010.000|TR0|And he made the point that she continues 
20110110221010.000|20110110221013.000|TR0|to respond to -- to commands.

20110110221028.000|20110110221030.000|TR0|UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: What I don't 
20110110221030.000|20110110221032.000|TR0|want to do is get into the specifics.  But 
20110110221032.000|20110110221035.000|TR0|as I've said before, when I say someone 
20110110221035.000|20110110221037.000|TR0|follows simple commands, it could be 
20110110221037.000|20110110221040.000|TR0|showing us their thumb, perhaps two 
20110110221040.000|20110110221042.000|TR0|fingers, gripping a hand, wiggling toes.  
20110110221042.000|20110110221045.000|TR0|All of those are simple commands that she 
20110110221045.000|20110110221047.000|TR0|can do, even though, for example, she has 
20110110221047.000|20110110221050.000|TR0|a breathing tube in place that would 
20110110221050.000|20110110221052.000|TR0|preclude more complex communication.

20110110221100.000|20110110221102.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Now, Wolf, the biggest concern at 
20110110221102.000|20110110221105.000|TR0|this point, as we've reported, is the 
20110110221105.000|20110110221107.000|TR0|possibility of swelling in her brain.  The 
20110110221107.000|20110110221110.000|TR0|doctors -- the surgeon said that she 
20110110221110.000|20110110221112.000|TR0|remains in danger of that at least through 
20110110221112.000|20110110221115.000|TR0|tomorrow, possibly through the end of the 
20110110221115.000|20110110221117.000|TR0|week.  They have removed a piece of her 
20110110221117.000|20110110221120.000|TR0|skull to minimize the chances of brain 
20110110221120.000|20110110221122.000|TR0|swelling.
20110110221122.000|20110110221125.000|TR0|
20110110221125.000|20110110221127.000|TR0|He said that they won't know more about 
20110110221127.000|20110110221130.000|TR0|any other effects of the gunshot until 
20110110221130.000|20110110221132.000|TR0|they remove that breathing tube -- for 
20110110221132.000|20110110221135.000|TR0|example, what kind of -- is her speech 
20110110221135.000|20110110221137.000|TR0|affected at all, sight, movement.  But 
20110110221137.000|20110110221140.000|TR0|they say her family is with her.  They do 
20110110221140.000|20110110221142.000|TR0|not know yet if she recognizes them, 
20110110221142.000|20110110221145.000|TR0|because the apparatus she's in doesn't 
20110110221145.000|20110110221147.000|TR0|allow them to.
20110110221147.000|20110110221149.000|TR0|
20110110221149.000|20110110221152.000|TR0|But they hope to know more as soon as they 
20110110221152.000|20110110221154.000|TR0|remove the breathing tube, either later 
20110110221154.000|20110110221157.000|TR0|this week or next week, hopefully, they 
20110110221157.000|20110110221159.000|TR0|say -- Wolf.

20110110221204.000|20110110221207.000|TR0|we heard from the Arizona governor, 
20110110221207.000|20110110221209.000|TR0|delivering what's called the state of the 
20110110221209.000|20110110221212.000|TR0|state address.

20110110221214.000|20110110221217.000|TR0|What is -- what was the basic point that 
20110110221217.000|20110110221219.000|TR0|she was making today, Jan Brewer?
20110110221219.000|20110110221222.000|TR0|
20110110221222.000|20110110221224.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Governor Jan Brewer delivered 
20110110221224.000|20110110221227.000|TR0|what most governors use to set the agenda 
20110110221227.000|20110110221229.000|TR0|for the next year.  She said normally she 
20110110221229.000|20110110221232.000|TR0|would talk about job creation, education, 
20110110221232.000|20110110221234.000|TR0|tax cuts.  But she said this is not the 
20110110221234.000|20110110221237.000|TR0|time. Instead, she addressed the tragedy.

20110110221252.000|20110110221254.000|TR0|events were not just an attack on those 
20110110221254.000|20110110221257.000|TR0|individuals we loved and lost, but an 
20110110221257.000|20110110221259.000|TR0|assault on our Constitutional republic, on 
20110110221259.000|20110110221302.000|TR0|our democracy, on all we treasure and all 
20110110221302.000|20110110221304.000|TR0|hold dear as citizens and public servants. 
20110110221304.000|20110110221306.000|TR0| Arizona is in pain.  Yes. Our grief is 
20110110221306.000|20110110221309.000|TR0|profound.  We are yet in the first hours 
20110110221309.000|20110110221311.000|TR0|of our sorrow. But we have not been 
20110110221311.000|20110110221314.000|TR0|brought down.  We will never be brought 
20110110221314.000|20110110221316.000|TR0|down.

20110110221326.000|20110110221329.000|TR0|Republican, has been something of a 
20110110221329.000|20110110221331.000|TR0|flashpoint for debate in this ongoing 
20110110221331.000|20110110221334.000|TR0|immigration battle here. But since this 
20110110221334.000|20110110221336.000|TR0|tragedy has happened, she has struck a 
20110110221336.000|20110110221339.000|TR0|very bipartisan tone -- a unifying tone, 
20110110221339.000|20110110221341.000|TR0|calling Gabrielle Giffords a good friend.
20110110221341.000|20110110221344.000|TR0|

20110110221351.000|20110110221354.000|TR0|site when the shooting occurred, who had 
20110110221354.000|20110110221356.000|TR0|medical training, rushed to take care of 
20110110221356.000|20110110221359.000|TR0|the Congresswoman.  And many of the 
20110110221359.000|20110110221401.000|TR0|Congresswoman's staffers, credit Hernandez 
20110110221401.000|20110110221404.000|TR0|with helping to save Congresswoman 
20110110221404.000|20110110221406.000|TR0|Giffords' life.  He was specially

20110110221438.000|20110110221441.000|TR0|He's got a little smirk there from that

20110110221550.000|20110110221553.000|TR0|there's no evidence that the rhetoric that

20110110221608.000|20110110221610.000|TR0|poisonous politics. They delayed a health

20110110221613.000|20110110221615.000|TR0|with a resolution to honor the victims of

20110110221927.000|20110110221929.000|TR0|him, you called her such a good name.  And 
20110110221929.000|20110110221932.000|TR0|that's celebrated.  We've got to make it...

20110110222004.000|20110110222006.000|TR0|BASH:  Now what Cleaver has said about 
20110110222006.000|20110110222009.000|TR0|both parties being responsible for this 
20110110222009.000|20110110222011.000|TR0|atmosphere is interesting, given the fact 
20110110222011.000|20110110222014.000|TR0|that over the weekend, we saw some of his 
20110110222014.000|20110110222016.000|TR0|Democratic colleagues not so subtly use 
20110110222016.000|20110110222019.000|TR0|this to go after Sarah Palin.  And you saw 
20110110222019.000|20110110222021.000|TR0|conservatives fight back and say wait a 
20110110222021.000|20110110222024.000|TR0|minute, Democrats are playing politics

20110110222029.000|20110110222031.000|TR0|But regardless, for the most part, by and 
20110110222031.000|20110110222034.000|TR0|large, we have seen members of Congress 
20110110222034.000|20110110222036.000|TR0|have a different tone here.  They are 
20110110222036.000|20110110222039.000|TR0|being much more courteous to each other, 
20110110222039.000|20110110222041.000|TR0|much -- much more camaraderie.

20110110222206.000|20110110222208.000|TR0|JACK CAFFERTY:  In light of the tragedy in 
20110110222208.000|20110110222210.000|TR0|Tucson, and the attempted assassination of 
20110110222210.000|20110110222213.000|TR0|a sitting member of Congress, some 
20110110222213.000|20110110222215.000|TR0|lawmakers are taking matters into their 
20110110222215.000|20110110222218.000|TR0|own hands.  They're saying now that they 
20110110222218.000|20110110222220.000|TR0|plan to carry guns in public in their home 
20110110222220.000|20110110222223.000|TR0|districts.
20110110222223.000|20110110222225.000|TR0|
20110110222225.000|20110110222228.000|TR0|Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz of 
20110110222228.000|20110110222230.000|TR0|Utah tells CNN he's always had a concealed 
20110110222230.000|20110110222233.000|TR0|weapon license and often carried a gun, 
20110110222233.000|20110110222235.000|TR0|but he says now he may do it more 
20110110222235.000|20110110222238.000|TR0|regularly.  Chaffetz says he's already 
20110110222238.000|20110110222240.000|TR0|gotten half a dozen death threats that 
20110110222240.000|20110110222243.000|TR0|have caused him to call the Capitol Police 
20110110222243.000|20110110222245.000|TR0|or local law enforcement after only two 
20110110222245.000|20110110222248.000|TR0|years in office.
20110110222248.000|20110110222250.000|TR0|
20110110222250.000|20110110222253.000|TR0|He also thinks Congress ought to consider 
20110110222253.000|20110110222255.000|TR0|using the U.S. marshal service to provide 
20110110222255.000|20110110222258.000|TR0|security for lawmakers in their districts 
20110110222258.000|20110110222300.000|TR0|like they do for federal judges.  Politico 
20110110222300.000|20110110222303.000|TR0|reports that Democratic Congressman Heath 
20110110222303.000|20110110222305.000|TR0|Schuler of North Carolina also plans to 
20110110222305.000|20110110222308.000|TR0|carry a gun more often and increased 
20110110222308.000|20110110222310.000|TR0|security in his district.
20110110222310.000|20110110222313.000|TR0|
20110110222313.000|20110110222315.000|TR0|Schuler's encouraging staffers to get 
20110110222315.000|20110110222318.000|TR0|their own permits to carry a gun.  He was 
20110110222318.000|20110110222320.000|TR0|the victim of a serious death threat a 
20110110222320.000|20110110222323.000|TR0|couple of years back.  Other lawmakers are 
20110110222323.000|20110110222325.000|TR0|taking steps to tighten security in their 
20110110222325.000|20110110222327.000|TR0|offices.  Some suggest local law 
20110110222327.000|20110110222330.000|TR0|enforcement could play a larger role at 
20110110222330.000|20110110222332.000|TR0|events like the one where Congresswoman 
20110110222332.000|20110110222335.000|TR0|Giffords was shot or at town hall meetings.

20110110222342.000|20110110222345.000|TR0|will continue to engage their constituents

20110110222352.000|20110110222355.000|TR0|Congress are now going to be carrying

20110110222549.000|20110110222552.000|TR0|told the court he doesn't believe he did 
20110110222552.000|20110110222554.000|TR0|anything wrong.

20110110222557.000|20110110222559.000|TR0|And the southeast is getting hammered with 
20110110222559.000|20110110222602.000|TR0|a rare blast of winter weather this hour.  
20110110222602.000|20110110222604.000|TR0|Take a look.  Snow, freezing rain and 
20110110222604.000|20110110222606.000|TR0|sleet are wreaking havoc on travelers and 
20110110222606.000|20110110222609.000|TR0|thousands are without power.  The weather 
20110110222609.000|20110110222611.000|TR0|system is expected to head northeast 
20110110222611.000|20110110222614.000|TR0|starting tomorrow.  Wolf --

20110110222631.000|20110110222634.000|TR0|
20110110222634.000|20110110222636.000|TR0|SYLVESTER:  Yes, if they have to get on a 
20110110222636.000|20110110222639.000|TR0|plane, they might want to check their 
20110110222639.000|20110110222641.000|TR0|flights ahead of time.
20110110222641.000|20110110222644.000|TR0|

20110110222649.000|20110110222651.000|TR0|All right, coming up, I'll speak live with 
20110110222651.000|20110110222654.000|TR0|the neurosurgeon treating Congresswoman 
20110110222654.000|20110110222656.000|TR0|Giffords and I'll ask him if he believes 
20110110222656.000|20110110222659.000|TR0|she'll be able to walk, be able to talk, 
20110110222659.000|20110110222701.000|TR0|how she's doing with her recovery.  
20110110222701.000|20110110222704.000|TR0|Standby for that.
20110110222704.000|20110110222706.000|TR0|
20110110222706.000|20110110222709.000|TR0|And we'll also hear what Sarah Palin is

20110110222719.000|20110110222721.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Let's get back to our top story 
20110110222721.000|20110110222723.000|TR0|right now within the past hour.  The 
20110110222723.000|20110110222726.000|TR0|accused shooter in Tucson, Jared Loughner 
20110110222726.000|20110110222728.000|TR0|in appeared in federal court.  Ted 
20110110222728.000|20110110222731.000|TR0|Rowlands was on the scene.  You're only a 
20110110222731.000|20110110222733.000|TR0|few feet away from him.  We're showing the 
20110110222733.000|20110110222736.000|TR0|mug shot that was just released. Update 
20110110222736.000|20110110222738.000|TR0|our viewers on how that went, Ted.
20110110222738.000|20110110222741.000|TR0|
20110110222741.000|20110110222743.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110110222743.000|20110110222746.000|TR0|you could see that he now has a shaved 
20110110222746.000|20110110222748.000|TR0|head.  He came into the courtroom in 
20110110222748.000|20110110222751.000|TR0|shackles.  He was a bit nervous at the 
20110110222751.000|20110110222753.000|TR0|beginning, but he understood everything 
20110110222753.000|20110110222756.000|TR0|the judge said. The judge and he had 
20110110222756.000|20110110222758.000|TR0|multiple back and forths throughout this 
20110110222758.000|20110110222801.000|TR0|15- minute hearing, probably 10 separate 
20110110222801.000|20110110222803.000|TR0|questions that Loughner had to answer to 
20110110222803.000|20110110222806.000|TR0|the judge.
20110110222806.000|20110110222808.000|TR0|
20110110222808.000|20110110222811.000|TR0|And each and every time he was coherent.  
20110110222811.000|20110110222813.000|TR0|He was succinct.  He had a strong voice, 
20110110222813.000|20110110222816.000|TR0|leaned into the microphone started off by 
20110110222816.000|20110110222818.000|TR0|saying "I am Jared Lee Loughner" and then 
20110110222818.000|20110110222821.000|TR0|from there every single time, the judge 
20110110222821.000|20110110222823.000|TR0|asked him a question he was at the podium, 
20110110222823.000|20110110222826.000|TR0|leaned into it and answered coherently and 
20110110222826.000|20110110222828.000|TR0|very strong.
20110110222828.000|20110110222831.000|TR0|
20110110222831.000|20110110222833.000|TR0|A little different than many people 
20110110222833.000|20110110222836.000|TR0|expected, because we had heard he wasn't 
20110110222836.000|20110110222838.000|TR0|cooperating with police.  We weren't sure 
20110110222838.000|20110110222840.000|TR0|if he could come in and be silent.  The 
20110110222840.000|20110110222843.000|TR0|judge at the beginning told him he could 
20110110222843.000|20110110222845.000|TR0|be or if he would speak or maybe disrupt 
20110110222845.000|20110110222848.000|TR0|the proceedings.  We saw a young man who 
20110110222848.000|20110110222850.000|TR0|understood everything and answered 
20110110222850.000|20110110222853.000|TR0|everything he was asked.
20110110222853.000|20110110222855.000|TR0|
20110110222855.000|20110110222858.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Stand by, Ted.  We're going to 
20110110222858.000|20110110222900.000|TR0|get back to you because we want more 
20110110222900.000|20110110222903.000|TR0|specifics on what happened in that

20110110222930.000|20110110222933.000|TR0|statement saying it is quite clear that 
20110110222933.000|20110110222935.000|TR0|liberals are trying to exploit the 
20110110222935.000|20110110222938.000|TR0|shooting for their own political benefit 
20110110222938.000|20110110222940.000|TR0|and used deception and dishonesty to try 
20110110222940.000|20110110222943.000|TR0|to smear all of us and our beliefs.  They 
20110110222943.000|20110110222945.000|TR0|are angry right now.  Why?

20110110222950.000|20110110222953.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  I have spoken to Tea Party 
20110110222953.000|20110110222955.000|TR0|groups here, Wolf.  They say it's because 
20110110222955.000|20110110222957.000|TR0|this suspect had nothing to do with them 
20110110222957.000|20110110223000.000|TR0|as far as they know.  They've checked 
20110110223000.000|20110110223002.000|TR0|their own lists.  They've gone through 
20110110223002.000|20110110223005.000|TR0|event video, and they say he is not 
20110110223005.000|20110110223007.000|TR0|attended their events or been affiliated 
20110110223007.000|20110110223010.000|TR0|and not mentioned their issues on his blog 
20110110223010.000|20110110223012.000|TR0|postings, et cetera.

20110110223015.000|20110110223017.000|TR0|They feel it's a rush to judgment to blame 
20110110223017.000|20110110223020.000|TR0|them for something where there's no clear 
20110110223020.000|20110110223022.000|TR0|connection.  There is in fairness some 
20110110223022.000|20110110223025.000|TR0|politicians here, had talked about 
20110110223025.000|20110110223027.000|TR0|changing the tone in this town of 
20110110223027.000|20110110223030.000|TR0|political debate before this but the tea

20110110223042.000|20110110223045.000|TR0|has been outspoken going back to the

20110110223117.000|20110110223119.000|TR0|when you heard him say that, he hasn't 
20110110223119.000|20110110223122.000|TR0|shied away, hasn't backed away from that 
20110110223122.000|20110110223124.000|TR0|since.  What did you think of that

20110110223129.000|20110110223132.000|TR0|JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  
20110110223132.000|20110110223134.000|TR0|Well, you know, I guess, I have a lot of 
20110110223134.000|20110110223137.000|TR0|friends in Arizona.  I was just out there 
20110110223137.000|20110110223139.000|TR0|and it's a state that depends, not 
20110110223139.000|20110110223142.000|TR0|totally, but a large measure on tourism 
20110110223142.000|20110110223144.000|TR0|and a lot of people invested a lot of 
20110110223144.000|20110110223147.000|TR0|money out there.
20110110223147.000|20110110223149.000|TR0|
20110110223149.000|20110110223152.000|TR0|When you have the governor falsely 
20110110223152.000|20110110223154.000|TR0|claiming that people are being beheaded 
20110110223154.000|20110110223157.000|TR0|and that kind of foolishness, it goes 
20110110223157.000|20110110223159.000|TR0|against I think an image that people who 
20110110223159.000|20110110223202.000|TR0|have real skin in the game, have real 
20110110223202.000|20110110223204.000|TR0|investment I think it goes against their 
20110110223204.000|20110110223207.000|TR0|interests and I think the sheriff is 
20110110223207.000|20110110223209.000|TR0|frustrated.
20110110223209.000|20110110223212.000|TR0|
20110110223212.000|20110110223214.000|TR0|I think some of the rhetoric out there 
20110110223214.000|20110110223217.000|TR0|gets mighty heated up sometimes.  I don't 
20110110223217.000|20110110223219.000|TR0|think that their governor is a judicious 
20110110223219.000|20110110223222.000|TR0|person that thinks things out very well, 
20110110223222.000|20110110223224.000|TR0|if at all, and this probably adds to it, 
20110110223224.000|20110110223227.000|TR0|but there's a lot - it's unfair to smear a 
20110110223227.000|20110110223229.000|TR0|whole state on the basis of - and this 
20110110223229.000|20110110223231.000|TR0|guy, he was a real nutty.  I mean, we've 
20110110223231.000|20110110223234.000|TR0|got nutty people in Louisiana.  There's 
20110110223234.000|20110110223236.000|TR0|nutty people everywhere.  This guy was one 
20110110223236.000|20110110223239.000|TR0|real, real nutty guy.
20110110223239.000|20110110223241.000|TR0|
20110110223241.000|20110110223244.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  You're talking 
20110110223244.000|20110110223246.000|TR0|about the alleged shooter in this case, 
20110110223246.000|20110110223249.000|TR0|James.
20110110223249.000|20110110223251.000|TR0|
20110110223251.000|20110110223254.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  Yes.
20110110223254.000|20110110223256.000|TR0|
20110110223256.000|20110110223259.000|TR0|BLITZER:  You're not talking about the 
20110110223259.000|20110110223301.000|TR0|sheriff.
20110110223301.000|20110110223304.000|TR0|
20110110223304.000|20110110223306.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  Yes, who, by the way, had -- I 
20110110223306.000|20110110223309.000|TR0|think the tea party there's no evidence 
20110110223309.000|20110110223311.000|TR0|that links him to the tea party that I've 
20110110223311.000|20110110223314.000|TR0|seen.  If somebody can produce some, I'd 
20110110223314.000|20110110223316.000|TR0|be willing to look at it.
20110110223316.000|20110110223319.000|TR0|
20110110223319.000|20110110223321.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is Sarah Palin being recklessly 
20110110223321.000|20110110223324.000|TR0|criticized right now, Alex, for the 
20110110223324.000|20110110223326.000|TR0|comments she's made about reloading and 
20110110223326.000|20110110223329.000|TR0|having a bull's eye on her district in 
20110110223329.000|20110110223331.000|TR0|Arizona?  Is that all unfair?
20110110223331.000|20110110223334.000|TR0|
20110110223334.000|20110110223336.000|TR0|ALEX CASTELLANOS, FORMER ROMNEY 
20110110223336.000|20110110223339.000|TR0|PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT: First, I 
20110110223339.000|20110110223341.000|TR0|think it's tremendously unfair.  Look, I'm 
20110110223341.000|20110110223344.000|TR0|not a big Sarah Palin Fan.  I think she's 
20110110223344.000|20110110223346.000|TR0|becoming increasingly irrelevant to the 
20110110223346.000|20110110223348.000|TR0|political debate.  A leader has to lead.  
20110110223348.000|20110110223351.000|TR0|She's really offering nothing new of where 
20110110223351.000|20110110223353.000|TR0|the Republican Party should go.
20110110223353.000|20110110223356.000|TR0|
20110110223356.000|20110110223358.000|TR0|Nevertheless, for anyone to say that 
20110110223358.000|20110110223401.000|TR0|Washington is doing such a great job that 
20110110223401.000|20110110223403.000|TR0|someone like Sarah Palin can't criticize 
20110110223403.000|20110110223406.000|TR0|it strongly and harshly and fight tough 
20110110223406.000|20110110223408.000|TR0|political battles to change the place, 
20110110223408.000|20110110223411.000|TR0|that's just ridiculous and to say that 
20110110223411.000|20110110223413.000|TR0|those Americans who are concerned about 
20110110223413.000|20110110223416.000|TR0|that somehow contributed to this tragedy 
20110110223416.000|20110110223418.000|TR0|is, I think, way overreaching, but that's 
20110110223418.000|20110110223421.000|TR0|what we've seen.
20110110223421.000|20110110223423.000|TR0|
20110110223423.000|20110110223426.000|TR0|You know, we have the Ft. Hood shooting.  
20110110223426.000|20110110223428.000|TR0|The president stands up and says, let's be 
20110110223428.000|20110110223431.000|TR0|patient.  Let's find out what happened.  
20110110223431.000|20110110223433.000|TR0|Let's not rush to judgment, but here in 
20110110223433.000|20110110223436.000|TR0|this case, 30 seconds later, let's blame 
20110110223436.000|20110110223438.000|TR0|Sarah Palin, and I think the Democrats are 
20110110223438.000|20110110223441.000|TR0|overreaching on that.
20110110223441.000|20110110223443.000|TR0|
20110110223443.000|20110110223446.000|TR0|BLITZER:  She was in that district, James, 
20110110223446.000|20110110223448.000|TR0|back on March 26th of 2010, and she was 
20110110223448.000|20110110223451.000|TR0|obviously campaigning for the Republican 
20110110223451.000|20110110223453.000|TR0|candidate for the tea party candidate.  
20110110223453.000|20110110223456.000|TR0|Listen to what she said then in Tucson.

20110110223503.000|20110110223506.000|TR0|SARAH PALIN, (R) FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR:  
20110110223506.000|20110110223508.000|TR0|We know violence isn't the answer.  When 
20110110223508.000|20110110223510.000|TR0|we take up our arms, we're talking about 
20110110223510.000|20110110223513.000|TR0|our vote. We're talking about being 
20110110223513.000|20110110223515.000|TR0|involved in a contested primary like this, 
20110110223515.000|20110110223518.000|TR0|and picking the right candidate, too, John 
20110110223518.000|20110110223520.000|TR0|McCain.  We thank you for that.  But this 
20110110223520.000|20110110223523.000|TR0|B.S. coming from the lame stream media 
20110110223523.000|20110110223525.000|TR0|lately about this, about inciting 
20110110223525.000|20110110223528.000|TR0|violence, don't let -- don't let the 
20110110223528.000|20110110223530.000|TR0|conversation be diverted.  Don't let a 
20110110223530.000|20110110223533.000|TR0|distraction like that get you off track.

20110110223540.000|20110110223543.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  James, she makes a 
20110110223543.000|20110110223545.000|TR0|fair point, do you think?
20110110223545.000|20110110223548.000|TR0|
20110110223548.000|20110110223550.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  I would point out Senator 
20110110223550.000|20110110223553.000|TR0|DeMint who is now the hero of the 
20110110223553.000|20110110223555.000|TR0|Republican Party said she's the most 
20110110223555.000|20110110223558.000|TR0|influential Republican since Ronald 
20110110223558.000|20110110223600.000|TR0|Reagan.  She is the intellectual center of 
20110110223600.000|20110110223603.000|TR0|that political party right now.  I think 
20110110223603.000|20110110223605.000|TR0|-- Jim DeMint, who Alex, as you know, is 
20110110223605.000|20110110223608.000|TR0|the most influential senator that they 
20110110223608.000|20110110223610.000|TR0|have say she's got more influence in 
20110110223610.000|20110110223613.000|TR0|Republicans than Ronald Reagan.  I'm just 
20110110223613.000|20110110223615.000|TR0|going on what she said.  I'm not the -- 
20110110223615.000|20110110223618.000|TR0|I'm not a Republican.  I just think that 
20110110223618.000|20110110223620.000|TR0|some of her language, I think, is 
20110110223620.000|20110110223623.000|TR0|unfortunate. I bet if she had to do it all 
20110110223623.000|20110110223625.000|TR0|over again she wouldn't put cross-hairs on 
20110110223625.000|20110110223627.000|TR0|the congressional districts that they 
20110110223627.000|20110110223630.000|TR0|wanted to win.  And some of her rhetoric 
20110110223630.000|20110110223632.000|TR0|is silly.  I don't think the woman is for 
20110110223632.000|20110110223635.000|TR0|violence. She's got five kids, but 
20110110223635.000|20110110223637.000|TR0|sometimes, they can -- but Sharron Angle, 
20110110223637.000|20110110223640.000|TR0|the tea party is definitely tolerant of 
20110110223640.000|20110110223642.000|TR0|extremism and violence.  Look what Sharron 
20110110223642.000|20110110223645.000|TR0|Angle said to tea party favorite that they 
20110110223645.000|20110110223647.000|TR0|would have to execute Second Amendment 
20110110223647.000|20110110223650.000|TR0|remedies against Senator Reid.  There's no 
20110110223650.000|20110110223652.000|TR0|excuse for that.  That's wrong, wrong, 
20110110223652.000|20110110223655.000|TR0|wrong.  And the tea party just dumped 
20110110223655.000|20110110223657.000|TR0|money after her.
20110110223657.000|20110110223700.000|TR0|
20110110223700.000|20110110223702.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Jessica, in fairness, sometimes, 
20110110223702.000|20110110223705.000|TR0|the liberals, sometimes the left wing of 
20110110223705.000|20110110223707.000|TR0|the Democratic Party, sometimes they get 
20110110223707.000|20110110223710.000|TR0|go off on tangents and say things that are 
20110110223710.000|20110110223712.000|TR0|not necessarily well-thought-out.

20110110223715.000|20110110223717.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL 
20110110223717.000|20110110223720.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely. And that's 
20110110223720.000|20110110223722.000|TR0|what a lot of conservatives and tea party 
20110110223722.000|20110110223725.000|TR0|activists are pointing to in particular 
20110110223725.000|20110110223727.000|TR0|comments president Obama made during the 
20110110223727.000|20110110223730.000|TR0|campaign when he said if they bring a 
20110110223730.000|20110110223732.000|TR0|knife to the fight, we'll bring a gun.  
20110110223732.000|20110110223735.000|TR0|Other comments, other Democrats have made, 
20110110223735.000|20110110223737.000|TR0|but you know the president said that once.
20110110223737.000|20110110223740.000|TR0|
20110110223740.000|20110110223742.000|TR0|He didn't repeat it, and it was a quote 
20110110223742.000|20110110223744.000|TR0|from the "Untouchables"  and what 
20110110223744.000|20110110223747.000|TR0|Democrats say in response to this in 
20110110223747.000|20110110223749.000|TR0|general because I'm being inundated with 
20110110223749.000|20110110223752.000|TR0|e-mail about this, Wolf, is that it's a 
20110110223752.000|20110110223754.000|TR0|false equivalency because in the view of 
20110110223754.000|20110110223757.000|TR0|liberals, they don't make these kind of 
20110110223757.000|20110110223759.000|TR0|violent parallels as much as the right 
20110110223759.000|20110110223802.000|TR0|does.
20110110223802.000|20110110223804.000|TR0|
20110110223804.000|20110110223807.000|TR0|The right, of course, thinks that's 
20110110223807.000|20110110223809.000|TR0|totally absurd.  The bigger question, 
20110110223809.000|20110110223812.000|TR0|Wolf, is, you know, President Obama has 
20110110223812.000|20110110223814.000|TR0|this opportunity to strike a post part as 
20110110223814.000|20110110223817.000|TR0|in tone.  We saw all of those people 
20110110223817.000|20110110223819.000|TR0|unified in Capitol Hill this morning.  How 
20110110223819.000|20110110223822.000|TR0|do you do it when the left and the right 
20110110223822.000|20110110223824.000|TR0|are this angry after an incident that 
20110110223824.000|20110110223827.000|TR0|would bring people together like this?
20110110223827.000|20110110223829.000|TR0|
20110110223829.000|20110110223832.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  Go ahead very 
20110110223832.000|20110110223834.000|TR0|quickly, Alex, wrap it up.
20110110223834.000|20110110223837.000|TR0|
20110110223837.000|20110110223839.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  Well, I think James is such 
20110110223839.000|20110110223842.000|TR0|a paragon of moderation in his rhetoric.  
20110110223842.000|20110110223844.000|TR0|Sarah Palin will certainly should model 
20110110223844.000|20110110223847.000|TR0|herself after him, and James you just said 
20110110223847.000|20110110223849.000|TR0|you don't want to smear the whole state 
20110110223849.000|20110110223852.000|TR0|but you just smeared the governor.  I 
20110110223852.000|20110110223854.000|TR0|think we could all use more maturity in 
20110110223854.000|20110110223857.000|TR0|our political rhetoric.
20110110223857.000|20110110223859.000|TR0|
20110110223859.000|20110110223901.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  I did.  I think that governor 
20110110223901.000|20110110223904.000|TR0|is vapid.
20110110223904.000|20110110223906.000|TR0|
20110110223906.000|20110110223909.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right --
20110110223909.000|20110110223911.000|TR0|
20110110223911.000|20110110223914.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  Did you watch her?  I think 
20110110223914.000|20110110223916.000|TR0|she's a vapid person.  I'm not smearing 
20110110223916.000|20110110223919.000|TR0|the whole state.  I think that --
20110110223919.000|20110110223921.000|TR0|
20110110223921.000|20110110223924.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110110223924.000|20110110223926.000|TR0|
20110110223926.000|20110110223929.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  There's nothing wrong with 
20110110223929.000|20110110223931.000|TR0|being critical of the government in 
20110110223931.000|20110110223934.000|TR0|Washington and had nothing to do with what 
20110110223934.000|20110110223936.000|TR0|this crazy guy did in Arizona.
20110110223936.000|20110110223939.000|TR0|
20110110223939.000|20110110223941.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  There's nothing wrong with 
20110110223941.000|20110110223944.000|TR0|saying that Jan Brewer is vapid because 
20110110223944.000|20110110223946.000|TR0|she is.
20110110223946.000|20110110223949.000|TR0|
20110110223949.000|20110110223951.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  We'll put you down as 
20110110223951.000|20110110223954.000|TR0|undecided then James.
20110110223954.000|20110110223956.000|TR0|
20110110223956.000|20110110223959.000|TR0|BLITZER:  James has never been shy.
20110110223959.000|20110110224001.000|TR0|
20110110224001.000|20110110224004.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  OK.  Put me down as -- OK.
20110110224004.000|20110110224006.000|TR0|
20110110224006.000|20110110224009.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  Guys, thanks very 
20110110224009.000|20110110224011.000|TR0|much.  Jessica, don't go too far away.  
20110110224011.000|20110110224014.000|TR0|We'll get back to you soon.
20110110224014.000|20110110224016.000|TR0|
20110110224016.000|20110110224018.000|TR0|The deadly massacre is raising new 
20110110224018.000|20110110224021.000|TR0|concerns about the safety of Congressional 
20110110224021.000|20110110224023.000|TR0|lawmakers.  What some members are planning 
20110110224023.000|20110110224026.000|TR0|to do next. That's coming up.
20110110224026.000|20110110224028.000|TR0|
20110110224028.000|20110110224031.000|TR0|Also, he helped bring down the alleged 
20110110224031.000|20110110224033.000|TR0|gunman even as a bullet grazed the back of 
20110110224033.000|20110110224036.000|TR0|his head.  We'll speak live with an 
20110110224036.000|20110110224038.000|TR0|eyewitness who was there, a hero.
20110110224038.000|20110110224041.000|TR0|
20110110224041.000|20110110224043.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

20110110224046.000|20110110224048.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Doctors in Tucson treating 
20110110224048.000|20110110224051.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords say she is not out 
20110110224051.000|20110110224053.000|TR0|of the woods, not by any means.  Dr. 
20110110224053.000|20110110224056.000|TR0|Michael Lemole is the chief of 
20110110224056.000|20110110224058.000|TR0|neurosurgery at the University Medican 
20110110224058.000|20110110224101.000|TR0|Center in Tucson. He's joining us now.  
20110110224101.000|20110110224103.000|TR0|Dr. Lemole, thanks very much for joining 
20110110224103.000|20110110224106.000|TR0|us. More importantly, thanks very much for 
20110110224106.000|20110110224108.000|TR0|treating not only the congresswoman but 
20110110224108.000|20110110224111.000|TR0|the others.  Give us latest on her 
20110110224111.000|20110110224113.000|TR0|condition.  How is she doing?
20110110224113.000|20110110224116.000|TR0|
20110110224116.000|20110110224118.000|TR0|DR. MICHAEL LEMOLE, CHIEF OF NEUROSURGERY 
20110110224118.000|20110110224121.000|TR0|UNIV MEDICAL CTR.:  The good news is that 
20110110224121.000|20110110224123.000|TR0|she's holding her own, and no change in 
20110110224123.000|20110110224126.000|TR0|her case is good for us.
20110110224126.000|20110110224128.000|TR0|
20110110224128.000|20110110224131.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is she responding to commands?
20110110224131.000|20110110224133.000|TR0|
20110110224133.000|20110110224135.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  She's still doing that when we 
20110110224135.000|20110110224138.000|TR0|back of on the sedation sufficiently.
20110110224138.000|20110110224140.000|TR0|
20110110224140.000|20110110224143.000|TR0|BLITZER:  What does that mean?  Like, can 
20110110224143.000|20110110224145.000|TR0|you give us an example, raise your hand, 
20110110224145.000|20110110224148.000|TR0|wiggle your toes?  What are you asking her 
20110110224148.000|20110110224150.000|TR0|to do?
20110110224150.000|20110110224153.000|TR0|
20110110224153.000|20110110224155.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  Exactly that.  Show us your 
20110110224155.000|20110110224158.000|TR0|thumb, squeeze my hand, wiggle your toes, 
20110110224158.000|20110110224200.000|TR0|all of those kinds of things we ask.
20110110224200.000|20110110224203.000|TR0|
20110110224203.000|20110110224205.000|TR0|BLITZER:  She can do all of those things?
20110110224205.000|20110110224208.000|TR0|
20110110224208.000|20110110224210.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  I don't want to go into her 
20110110224210.000|20110110224213.000|TR0|specifics, but she is giving us enough 
20110110224213.000|20110110224215.000|TR0|information to let us know that she's in 
20110110224215.000|20110110224218.000|TR0|there and she's able to respond to us.
20110110224218.000|20110110224220.000|TR0|
20110110224220.000|20110110224223.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is she still, I assume, 
20110110224223.000|20110110224225.000|TR0|connected to all the breathing tubes, the 
20110110224225.000|20110110224228.000|TR0|IVs, the respirator, everything along 
20110110224228.000|20110110224230.000|TR0|those lines in intensive care, is that 
20110110224230.000|20110110224233.000|TR0|right?
20110110224233.000|20110110224235.000|TR0|
20110110224235.000|20110110224238.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  Everything is fully connected, 
20110110224238.000|20110110224240.000|TR0|and of course, that limits our examination 
20110110224240.000|20110110224243.000|TR0|and so what I'm giving you sounds like I'm 
20110110224243.000|20110110224245.000|TR0|being very vague, but to some extent, 
20110110224245.000|20110110224248.000|TR0|we're very limited in our ability to 
20110110224248.000|20110110224250.000|TR0|assess her.
20110110224250.000|20110110224252.000|TR0|
20110110224252.000|20110110224255.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Is she or is she not in what's 
20110110224255.000|20110110224257.000|TR0|called an induced coma?
20110110224257.000|20110110224300.000|TR0|
20110110224300.000|20110110224302.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  That's another way of saying 
20110110224302.000|20110110224305.000|TR0|sedation or anesthetic sedation. It simply 
20110110224305.000|20110110224307.000|TR0|makes her comfortable between the 
20110110224307.000|20110110224310.000|TR0|examination times. Breathing tubes are 
20110110224310.000|20110110224312.000|TR0|terribly uncomfortable.  She's got to be 
20110110224312.000|20110110224315.000|TR0|feeling some pain from the surgery itself. 
20110110224315.000|20110110224317.000|TR0| And so, we want to make her as 
20110110224317.000|20110110224320.000|TR0|comfortable as possible.
20110110224320.000|20110110224322.000|TR0|
20110110224322.000|20110110224325.000|TR0|BLITZER:  So, when you put her in an 
20110110224325.000|20110110224327.000|TR0|induced coma, let's say, where you put it 
20110110224327.000|20110110224330.000|TR0|asleep, I guess, might be a little bit 
20110110224330.000|20110110224332.000|TR0|more, I guess, accurate way of describing 
20110110224332.000|20110110224335.000|TR0|it, she feels no pain at that time.  The 
20110110224335.000|20110110224337.000|TR0|whole purpose is so that she doesn't feel 
20110110224337.000|20110110224340.000|TR0|pain?
20110110224340.000|20110110224342.000|TR0|
20110110224342.000|20110110224345.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  Correct.
20110110224345.000|20110110224347.000|TR0|
20110110224347.000|20110110224350.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We spoke the other night, at 
20110110224350.000|20110110224352.000|TR0|least I did, with Dr. Sanjay Gupta, our 
20110110224352.000|20110110224355.000|TR0|CNN medical correspondent, who himself is 
20110110224355.000|20110110224357.000|TR0|a neurosurgeon. He says sometimes you do 
20110110224357.000|20110110224400.000|TR0|an induced coma to make sure the swelling 
20110110224400.000|20110110224402.000|TR0|in the brain doesn't go on, and it's a way 
20110110224402.000|20110110224405.000|TR0|of dealing with the issues that could 
20110110224405.000|20110110224407.000|TR0|complicate the recovery.
20110110224407.000|20110110224410.000|TR0|
20110110224410.000|20110110224412.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  And that's why I'm a little 
20110110224412.000|20110110224414.000|TR0|uncomfortable with the term "induced 
20110110224414.000|20110110224417.000|TR0|coma."  Because we have something what we 
20110110224417.000|20110110224419.000|TR0|call barbiturate coma and that's actually 
20110110224419.000|20110110224422.000|TR0|for the purpose of knocking down the 
20110110224422.000|20110110224424.000|TR0|metabolic rate of the brain cells so that 
20110110224424.000|20110110224427.000|TR0|they don't require as much oxygen in those 
20110110224427.000|20110110224429.000|TR0|cases where we're having a hard time 
20110110224429.000|20110110224432.000|TR0|giving the brain oxygen.  And that is a 
20110110224432.000|20110110224434.000|TR0|very specific type of coma.  What we're 
20110110224434.000|20110110224437.000|TR0|doing here is not that.
20110110224437.000|20110110224439.000|TR0|
20110110224439.000|20110110224442.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I know I asked you if you could 
20110110224442.000|20110110224444.000|TR0|bring a diagram or a brain to show us a 
20110110224444.000|20110110224447.000|TR0|little bit of what's going on and I take 
20110110224447.000|20110110224449.000|TR0|it you have something you can show us?
20110110224449.000|20110110224452.000|TR0|
20110110224452.000|20110110224454.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  What I have here is a brain 
20110110224454.000|20110110224457.000|TR0|model, and I don't want to get into the 
20110110224457.000|20110110224459.000|TR0|specifics of her case, but what I can show 
20110110224459.000|20110110224502.000|TR0|you on this model is where the bullet 
20110110224502.000|20110110224504.000|TR0|didn't go and why she's doing so well, we 
20110110224504.000|20110110224507.000|TR0|think. If you look down sort of the 
20110110224507.000|20110110224509.000|TR0|geometric center of this brain model, 
20110110224509.000|20110110224512.000|TR0|right down in here, this is a critical 
20110110224512.000|20110110224514.000|TR0|relay center.  This is where all of the 
20110110224514.000|20110110224517.000|TR0|information coming up from the spinal cord 
20110110224517.000|20110110224519.000|TR0|and the body has to pass through and be 
20110110224519.000|20110110224522.000|TR0|parceled out to the brain, and likewise, 
20110110224522.000|20110110224524.000|TR0|anything the brain wants to tell the rest 
20110110224524.000|20110110224527.000|TR0|of the world or any kind of commands it 
20110110224527.000|20110110224529.000|TR0|wants to carry out has to pass through 
20110110224529.000|20110110224531.000|TR0|that area.
20110110224531.000|20110110224534.000|TR0|
20110110224534.000|20110110224536.000|TR0|So, if a bullet goes through there, it's a 
20110110224536.000|20110110224539.000|TR0|very different story.  If a bullet goes 
20110110224539.000|20110110224541.000|TR0|through these fluid spaces, again, very -- 
20110110224541.000|20110110224544.000|TR0|and right there, it's sort of purplish.  
20110110224544.000|20110110224546.000|TR0|It's also a very, very poor prognosis 
20110110224546.000|20110110224549.000|TR0|because it's near those arousal centers, 
20110110224549.000|20110110224551.000|TR0|those areas that control your level of 
20110110224551.000|20110110224554.000|TR0|alertness.  And if a bullet goes from side 
20110110224554.000|20110110224556.000|TR0|to side, meaning that is affected both 
20110110224556.000|20110110224559.000|TR0|sides, again, very poor prognosis.  And 
20110110224559.000|20110110224601.000|TR0|I'm happy to say, in her case, none of 
20110110224601.000|20110110224604.000|TR0|those trajectories happened.  And I think 
20110110224604.000|20110110224606.000|TR0|that's why she's doing so well.
20110110224606.000|20110110224609.000|TR0|
20110110224609.000|20110110224611.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And what you've said publicly, I 
20110110224611.000|20110110224614.000|TR0|don't want you to say anything that you 
20110110224614.000|20110110224616.000|TR0|don't want to say for obvious reasons is 
20110110224616.000|20110110224619.000|TR0|that it went from the back to the front on 
20110110224619.000|20110110224621.000|TR0|the left side, is that right? LEMOLE:  Let 
20110110224621.000|20110110224624.000|TR0|me qualify that because our assessment was 
20110110224624.000|20110110224626.000|TR0|not forensic by any means, and all we can 
20110110224626.000|20110110224629.000|TR0|tell based upon the fracture on the front 
20110110224629.000|20110110224631.000|TR0|and the back is we thought that maybe it 
20110110224631.000|20110110224634.000|TR0|was going from the back to the front, but 
20110110224634.000|20110110224636.000|TR0|we're very quick to say we might be wrong 
20110110224636.000|20110110224639.000|TR0|on that.  And I'm sure the forensic 
20110110224639.000|20110110224641.000|TR0|scientist will actually reconstruct the 
20110110224641.000|20110110224644.000|TR0|crime scene.
20110110224644.000|20110110224646.000|TR0|
20110110224646.000|20110110224648.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We're talking now, not this 
20110110224648.000|20110110224651.000|TR0|week, perhaps, months for recovery, is 
20110110224651.000|20110110224653.000|TR0|that right?
20110110224653.000|20110110224656.000|TR0|
20110110224656.000|20110110224658.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  I think that's fair.
20110110224658.000|20110110224701.000|TR0|
20110110224701.000|20110110224703.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And the prospect of her walking 
20110110224703.000|20110110224706.000|TR0|and talking and seeing and all of that, 
20110110224706.000|20110110224708.000|TR0|what are her chances?
20110110224708.000|20110110224711.000|TR0|
20110110224711.000|20110110224713.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  Without going into her case in 
20110110224713.000|20110110224716.000|TR0|specific, for these kind of injuries, the 
20110110224716.000|20110110224718.000|TR0|entire range is possible, from basically 
20110110224718.000|20110110224721.000|TR0|very poor recovery to very full functional 
20110110224721.000|20110110224723.000|TR0|recovery, and I don't think it's useful to 
20110110224723.000|20110110224726.000|TR0|prognosticate before we even have her 
20110110224726.000|20110110224728.000|TR0|awake and the breathing tube taken out and 
20110110224728.000|20110110224731.000|TR0|we can even fully assess her.
20110110224731.000|20110110224733.000|TR0|
20110110224733.000|20110110224736.000|TR0|BLITZER:  When she does awake and when you 
20110110224736.000|20110110224738.000|TR0|have a chance to speak with her, Dr. 
20110110224738.000|20110110224741.000|TR0|Lemole, go ahead and tell her that all of 
20110110224741.000|20110110224743.000|TR0|our viewers here at CNN in the United 
20110110224743.000|20110110224746.000|TR0|States and around the world were praying 
20110110224746.000|20110110224748.000|TR0|for her and we wish her a speedy recovery. 
20110110224748.000|20110110224751.000|TR0| And we thank you, Dr. Lemole, very much 
20110110224751.000|20110110224753.000|TR0|for doing what you're doing, your entire

20110110224813.000|20110110224815.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  Dr. Michael Lemole 
20110110224815.000|20110110224818.000|TR0|is the chief of neurology at Tucson 
20110110224818.000|20110110224820.000|TR0|University Medical Center.  He's a 
20110110224820.000|20110110224823.000|TR0|neurosurgeon.  He's doing what he's doing,

20110110224848.000|20110110224850.000|TR0|with local law enforcement to make sure 
20110110224850.000|20110110224853.000|TR0|that security at events in home districts 
20110110224853.000|20110110224855.000|TR0|is adequate.  They also say they'll 
20110110224855.000|20110110224858.000|TR0|develop more formal procedures for dealing 
20110110224858.000|20110110224900.000|TR0|with potential threats, that includes

20110110224937.000|20110110224940.000|TR0|there are parades to go to, town hall

20110110225007.000|20110110225010.000|TR0|that's not who we are.  We come from the

20110110225027.000|20110110225030.000|TR0|very difficult for me to be a member of

20110110225042.000|20110110225044.000|TR0|the U.S. Marshal Service which protects 
20110110225044.000|20110110225047.000|TR0|federal judges should do the same for 
20110110225047.000|20110110225049.000|TR0|lawmakers.  And he says, he's also taking

20110110225244.000|20110110225246.000|TR0|CONTRIBUTOR:  Question this hour, what 
20110110225246.000|20110110225249.000|TR0|does it say about our country that some 
20110110225249.000|20110110225251.000|TR0|members of the U.S. Congress are now going 
20110110225251.000|20110110225254.000|TR0|to be carrying guns in the wake of the 
20110110225254.000|20110110225256.000|TR0|situation in Tucson?  We got this from 
20110110225256.000|20110110225259.000|TR0|Strom in Charleston, South Carolina.  I 
20110110225259.000|20110110225301.000|TR0|think members of Congress carrying 
20110110225301.000|20110110225304.000|TR0|firearms might be going a bit too far, but 
20110110225304.000|20110110225306.000|TR0|the days of being able to directly meet 
20110110225306.000|20110110225309.000|TR0|with your constituents in the small public 
20110110225309.000|20110110225311.000|TR0|forums are simply over.  It's just not 
20110110225311.000|20110110225314.000|TR0|safe.

20110110225318.000|20110110225321.000|TR0|hateful rhetoric has left these leaders 
20110110225321.000|20110110225323.000|TR0|fearing for their lives.  Who is going to 
20110110225323.000|20110110225326.000|TR0|want to serve the people if you can be 
20110110225326.000|20110110225328.000|TR0|killed because of the likes of Limbaugh, 
20110110225328.000|20110110225331.000|TR0|Beck, and Palin have inflamed people to 
20110110225331.000|20110110225333.000|TR0|become monsters?  Sad.

20110110225346.000|20110110225348.000|TR0|Steve in Virginia Beach, it says a lot of 
20110110225348.000|20110110225351.000|TR0|things.  Our expectations of effective 
20110110225351.000|20110110225353.000|TR0|parenting and traditional American values 
20110110225353.000|20110110225356.000|TR0|aren't nearly what they used to be.  It 
20110110225356.000|20110110225358.000|TR0|says our politicians ignoring the 
20110110225358.000|20110110225401.000|TR0|importance of the rule of law for so many 
20110110225401.000|20110110225403.000|TR0|decades wasn't a good idea either.  And it 
20110110225403.000|20110110225406.000|TR0|says Congress is still addressing symptoms 
20110110225406.000|20110110225408.000|TR0|instead of the underlying problems.

20110110225413.000|20110110225416.000|TR0|guys aren't already carrying guns.  For 
20110110225416.000|20110110225418.000|TR0|years, they've claimed to be advocates of 
20110110225418.000|20110110225421.000|TR0|pro-gun legislation to the point where 
20110110225421.000|20110110225423.000|TR0|they have written laws to allow guns into 
20110110225423.000|20110110225426.000|TR0|our national parks, our universities, our 
20110110225426.000|20110110225428.000|TR0|trains, and our political events.  Now, 
20110110225428.000|20110110225431.000|TR0|things are so dangerous they have to 
20110110225431.000|20110110225433.000|TR0|protect themselves from lunatics who are

20110110225443.000|20110110225445.000|TR0|own personal safety, how about tightening 
20110110225445.000|20110110225448.000|TR0|the gun laws in the U.S. so we're all safe 
20110110225448.000|20110110225450.000|TR0|from the crazies among us?

20110110225458.000|20110110225500.000|TR0|of them calling each other liars, 
20110110225500.000|20110110225503.000|TR0|socialist, bigot, they can start shooting 
20110110225503.000|20110110225505.000|TR0|each other.  This country is becoming more

20110110225635.000|20110110225637.000|TR0|defense attorney who's never shied away 
20110110225637.000|20110110225640.000|TR0|from high-profile cases.  She represented 
20110110225640.000|20110110225642.000|TR0|the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski.  A fellow 
20110110225642.000|20110110225645.000|TR0|public defender in that case calls Clarke 
20110110225645.000|20110110225647.000|TR0|a tireless worker who is one of the top, 
20110110225647.000|20110110225650.000|TR0|if not the top, legal defenders in the 
20110110225650.000|20110110225652.000|TR0|country.  Kaczynski pleaded guilty in a 
20110110225652.000|20110110225655.000|TR0|deal that spared him the death penalty.
20110110225655.000|20110110225657.000|TR0|
20110110225657.000|20110110225700.000|TR0|Clarke also assisted in the defense of 
20110110225700.000|20110110225702.000|TR0|confessed al Qaeda operative, Zacarias 
20110110225702.000|20110110225705.000|TR0|Moussaoui.  He, too, is serving a life 
20110110225705.000|20110110225707.000|TR0|sentence in prison. Those cases posed a

20110110225722.000|20110110225724.000|TR0|obviously guilty of the crime charged and 
20110110225724.000|20110110225727.000|TR0|turn a death penalty case into a life

20110110225737.000|20110110225739.000|TR0|Toobin.  A mental state defense is all

20110110225747.000|20110110225749.000|TR0|Judy Clarke is to persuade the prosecutors 
20110110225749.000|20110110225752.000|TR0|that he is so damaged, that her client is 
20110110225752.000|20110110225754.000|TR0|so psychologically impaired that no 
20110110225754.000|20110110225757.000|TR0|purpose, no deterrent purpose would be 
20110110225757.000|20110110225759.000|TR0|served by executing him and all that needs 
20110110225759.000|20110110225802.000|TR0|to be done is separate him from society 
20110110225802.000|20110110225804.000|TR0|for the rest of his life.

20110110225807.000|20110110225809.000|TR0|SNOW:  There are some cases that didn't go 
20110110225809.000|20110110225812.000|TR0|to trial.  In 1998, Russell Weston was 
20110110225812.000|20110110225814.000|TR0|accused of killing two Capitol Hill police 
20110110225814.000|20110110225817.000|TR0|officers.  Barry Boss was his public 
20110110225817.000|20110110225819.000|TR0|defender.
20110110225819.000|20110110225822.000|TR0|
20110110225822.000|20110110225824.000|TR0|BARRY BOSS, COZEN O'CONNOR:  He was, you 
20110110225824.000|20110110225826.000|TR0|know, headed into the Capitol to try to 
20110110225826.000|20110110225829.000|TR0|seize control of this time control machine 
20110110225829.000|20110110225831.000|TR0|that he believed was at the Capitol and 
20110110225831.000|20110110225834.000|TR0|thought that he was saving humanity by 
20110110225834.000|20110110225836.000|TR0|doing it.
20110110225836.000|20110110225839.000|TR0|
20110110225839.000|20110110225841.000|TR0|SNOW:  Weston was deemed incompetent found 
20110110225841.000|20110110225844.000|TR0|to have no understanding of the 
20110110225844.000|20110110225846.000|TR0|proceedings against him.  There's a 
20110110225846.000|20110110225849.000|TR0|different threshold for the mental 
20110110225849.000|20110110225851.000|TR0|insanity defense.
20110110225851.000|20110110225854.000|TR0|
20110110225854.000|20110110225856.000|TR0|BOSS:  The defendant has to prove by clear 
20110110225856.000|20110110225859.000|TR0|and convincing evidence that he didn't 
20110110225859.000|20110110225901.000|TR0|understand that he has a mental disease or 
20110110225901.000|20110110225904.000|TR0|defect and that he didn't understand or 
20110110225904.000|20110110225906.000|TR0|appreciate his conduct or understand the 
20110110225906.000|20110110225909.000|TR0|wrongfulness of it.  So, that's also very 
20110110225909.000|20110110225911.000|TR0|difficult to establish.

20110110225919.000|20110110225921.000|TR0|SNOW (on-camera):  As Jared Lee Loughner 
20110110225921.000|20110110225924.000|TR0|is likely to undergo a lengthy battery of 
20110110225924.000|20110110225926.000|TR0|exams by psychiatrists and psychologists 
20110110225926.000|20110110225929.000|TR0|in the coming months.  They'll be hired by 
20110110225929.000|20110110225931.000|TR0|both the government and the defense, and 
20110110225931.000|20110110225934.000|TR0|their conclusions will go a long way in 
20110110225934.000|20110110225936.000|TR0|determining whether Loughner will ever 
20110110225936.000|20110110225939.000|TR0|face the death penalty -- Wolf. BLITZER:  
20110110225939.000|20110110225941.000|TR0|All right.  Mary, thank you.
