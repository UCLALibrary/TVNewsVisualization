20110110140751.272|20110110140752.839|TR0|able to stay in their home, 
20110110140752.839|20110110140754.406|TR0|despite the fact that it was 
20110110140754.406|20110110140755.973|TR0|foreclosed upon in 2007, and 
20110110140755.973|20110110140757.540|TR0|Antonio Ibanez will have the

20110110140802.240|20110110140803.807|TR0|home, then it will have to pay

20110110141258.388|20110110141259.955|TR0|as human shields, the Muslims 
20110110141259.955|20110110141301.522|TR0|surrounded churches in an 
20110110141301.522|20110110141303.089|TR0|attempt to prevent any more 
20110110141303.089|20110110141304.655|TR0|attacks. The Muslims organized 
20110110141304.655|20110110141306.222|TR0|under the slogan: "We either

20110110141315.624|20110110141317.191|TR0|prosecutors have charged Jared 
20110110141317.191|20110110141318.758|TR0|Lee Loughner with the attempted 
20110110141318.758|20110110141320.325|TR0|assassination of Arizona 
20110110141320.325|20110110141321.892|TR0|Congress member Gabrielle 
20110110141321.892|20110110141323.459|TR0|Giffords, as well as the murders 
20110110141323.459|20110110141325.025|TR0|of her aide, Gabe Zimmerman, and 
20110110141325.025|20110110141326.592|TR0|the chief federal judge of the 
20110110141326.592|20110110141328.159|TR0|state.

20110110141329.726|20110110141331.293|TR0|Giffords, a Democrat 
20110110141331.293|20110110141332.860|TR0|representing the Tucson area, 
20110110141332.860|20110110141334.427|TR0|was shot in the back of the head 
20110110141334.427|20110110141335.994|TR0|at close range on Saturday 
20110110141335.994|20110110141337.561|TR0|morning outside a supermarket in 
20110110141337.561|20110110141339.128|TR0|Tucson, where she was holding an 
20110110141339.128|20110110141340.695|TR0|event called "Congress on Your 
20110110141340.695|20110110141342.262|TR0|Corner" to meet with 
20110110141342.262|20110110141343.828|TR0|constituents. After shooting 
20110110141343.828|20110110141345.395|TR0|Giffords, the gunman opened fire 
20110110141345.395|20110110141346.962|TR0|on the small crowd. In all, 20 
20110110141346.962|20110110141348.529|TR0|people were shot, six were 
20110110141348.529|20110110141350.096|TR0|killed. The dead include U.S. 
20110110141350.096|20110110141351.663|TR0|District Judge John Roll, 
20110110141351.663|20110110141353.230|TR0|Giffords' aide Gabe Zimmerman, a 
20110110141353.230|20110110141354.797|TR0|nine year-old girl born on 9/11, 
20110110141354.797|20110110141356.364|TR0|and three people in their late 
20110110141356.364|20110110141357.931|TR0|seventies.

20110110141359.498|20110110141401.065|TR0|Other federal charges against 
20110110141401.065|20110110141402.631|TR0|Loughner include two counts of 
20110110141402.631|20110110141404.198|TR0|attempting to kill a federal 
20110110141404.198|20110110141405.765|TR0|employee. More charges are 
20110110141405.765|20110110141407.332|TR0|expected.

20110110141408.899|20110110141410.466|TR0|The court documents filed Sunday 
20110110141410.466|20110110141412.033|TR0|suggest the attack was a 
20110110141412.033|20110110141413.600|TR0|premeditated assassination 
20110110141413.600|20110110141415.167|TR0|attempt. The FBI says, on an 
20110110141415.167|20110110141416.734|TR0|envelope, Loughner wrote, "I 
20110110141416.734|20110110141418.301|TR0|planned ahead," "My 
20110110141418.301|20110110141419.868|TR0|assassination" and "Giffords." 
20110110141419.868|20110110141421.434|TR0|He then signed the note. The 
20110110141421.434|20110110141423.001|TR0|envelope was kept in a safe at 
20110110141423.001|20110110141424.568|TR0|Loughner's home alongside a 
20110110141424.568|20110110141426.135|TR0|letter from Giffords in 2007 
20110110141426.135|20110110141427.702|TR0|thanking him for attending a 
20110110141427.702|20110110141429.269|TR0|meeting similar to the one he 
20110110141429.269|20110110141430.836|TR0|attacked on Saturday.
20110110141430.836|20110110141432.403|TR0|
20110110141432.403|20110110141433.970|TR0|While the motivation for the 
20110110141433.970|20110110141435.537|TR0|attack remains unclear, the 
20110110141435.537|20110110141437.104|TR0|picture emerging of Loughner is 
20110110141437.104|20110110141438.671|TR0|of a severely disturbed 
20110110141438.671|20110110141440.237|TR0|22-year-old with mental health 
20110110141440.237|20110110141441.804|TR0|issues. In September, Loughner 
20110110141441.804|20110110141443.371|TR0|was suspended from Pima County 
20110110141443.371|20110110141444.938|TR0|Community College after five 
20110110141444.938|20110110141446.505|TR0|run-ins with campus police for 
20110110141446.505|20110110141448.072|TR0|disruptive behavior. One student 
20110110141448.072|20110110141449.639|TR0|who attended class with him 
20110110141449.639|20110110141451.206|TR0|wrote an email to friends 
20110110141451.206|20110110141452.773|TR0|saying, quote, "We have a 
20110110141452.773|20110110141454.340|TR0|mentally unstable person in the 
20110110141454.340|20110110141455.907|TR0|class that scares the living 
20110110141455.907|20110110141457.474|TR0|crap out of me. He is one of 
20110110141457.474|20110110141459.040|TR0|those whose picture you see on 
20110110141459.040|20110110141500.607|TR0|the news, after he has come into 
20110110141500.607|20110110141502.174|TR0|class with an automatic weapon," 
20110110141502.174|20110110141503.741|TR0|she wrote.

20110110141508.442|20110110141510.009|TR0|suggest an obsession with 
20110110141510.009|20110110141511.576|TR0|bizarre anti-government 
20110110141511.576|20110110141513.143|TR0|grievances, including ramblings 
20110110141513.143|20110110141514.710|TR0|about currency policies and 
20110110141514.710|20110110141516.277|TR0|language control through 
20110110141516.277|20110110141517.844|TR0|grammar. Investigators are also 
20110110141517.844|20110110141519.410|TR0|exploring suspected links 
20110110141519.410|20110110141520.977|TR0|between Loughner and American 
20110110141520.977|20110110141522.544|TR0|[Renaissance], a group known for 
20110110141522.544|20110110141524.111|TR0|white supremacist, 
20110110141524.111|20110110141525.678|TR0|anti-immigrant rhetoric.

20110110141527.245|20110110141528.812|TR0|Loughner is scheduled to appear 
20110110141528.812|20110110141530.379|TR0|this afternoon in U.S. District

20110110141533.513|20110110141535.080|TR0|The charges filed on Sunday came 
20110110141535.080|20110110141536.647|TR0|hours after doctors in Tucson 
20110110141536.647|20110110141538.213|TR0|gave an update on Giffords' 
20110110141538.213|20110110141539.780|TR0|condition and said she's able to 
20110110141539.780|20110110141541.347|TR0|respond to simple commands 
20110110141541.347|20110110141542.914|TR0|following emergency brain 
20110110141542.914|20110110141544.481|TR0|surgery. She remains sedated and 
20110110141544.481|20110110141546.048|TR0|in critical condition. Doctors 
20110110141546.048|20110110141547.615|TR0|said the bullet traversed the 
20110110141547.615|20110110141549.182|TR0|left side of her brain, entering 
20110110141549.182|20110110141550.749|TR0|from back, exiting the front. 
20110110141550.749|20110110141552.316|TR0|This is trauma physician Peter 
20110110141552.316|20110110141553.883|TR0|Rhee.
20110110141553.883|20110110141555.450|TR0|
20110110141555.450|20110110141557.016|TR0|>> DR. PETER RHEE: Everybody's 
20110110141557.016|20110110141558.583|TR0|going to be cautious about 
20110110141558.583|20110110141600.150|TR0|overcalling it, but I am 
20110110141600.150|20110110141601.717|TR0|optimistic. I was optimistic 
20110110141601.717|20110110141603.284|TR0|yesterday when I saw the case 
20110110141603.284|20110110141604.851|TR0|and I saw the brain and the 
20110110141604.851|20110110141606.418|TR0|amount of injury that had gone 
20110110141606.418|20110110141607.985|TR0|through. But overall, this is 
20110110141607.985|20110110141609.552|TR0|about as good as you're going to 
20110110141609.552|20110110141611.119|TR0|get. You know, when you get shot 
20110110141611.119|20110110141612.686|TR0|in the head and the bullet goes 
20110110141612.686|20110110141614.253|TR0|through your brain, the chances 
20110110141614.253|20110110141615.819|TR0|of you living is very small, and 
20110110141615.819|20110110141617.386|TR0|the chances of you waking up and 
20110110141617.386|20110110141618.953|TR0|actually following commands is 
20110110141618.953|20110110141620.520|TR0|even much smaller than that. So 
20110110141620.520|20110110141622.087|TR0|this, so far, has been a very 
20110110141622.087|20110110141623.654|TR0|good situation. Hopefully it 
20110110141623.654|20110110141625.221|TR0|will stay that way. OK? 
20110110141625.221|20110110141626.788|TR0|Obviously we don't know which 
20110110141626.788|20110110141628.355|TR0|way - which direction she's 
20110110141628.355|20110110141629.922|TR0|going to go. It's still very 
20110110141629.922|20110110141631.489|TR0|precarious at this time.

20110110141633.056|20110110141634.622|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: The White House 
20110110141634.622|20110110141636.189|TR0|announced on Sunday that 
20110110141636.189|20110110141637.756|TR0|President Obama will observe a 
20110110141637.756|20110110141639.323|TR0|moment of silence for the 
20110110141639.323|20110110141640.890|TR0|victims at 11:00 Eastern time 
20110110141640.890|20110110141642.457|TR0|today. Hours after the shooting 
20110110141642.457|20110110141644.024|TR0|Saturday, Obama made a televised 
20110110141644.024|20110110141645.591|TR0|statement from the White House.
20110110141645.591|20110110141647.158|TR0|
20110110141647.158|20110110141648.725|TR0|>> PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We 
20110110141648.725|20110110141650.292|TR0|are still assembling all the 
20110110141650.292|20110110141651.859|TR0|facts, but we know that 
20110110141651.859|20110110141653.426|TR0|Representative Giffords was one 
20110110141653.426|20110110141654.992|TR0|of the victims. She is currently 
20110110141654.992|20110110141656.559|TR0|at a hospital in the area, and 
20110110141656.559|20110110141658.126|TR0|she is battling for her life. We 
20110110141658.126|20110110141659.693|TR0|also know that at least five 
20110110141659.693|20110110141701.260|TR0|people lost their lives in this 
20110110141701.260|20110110141702.827|TR0|tragedy. Among them were a 
20110110141702.827|20110110141704.394|TR0|federal judge, John Roll, who

20110110141707.528|20110110141709.095|TR0|a young girl, who was barely 
20110110141709.095|20110110141710.662|TR0|nine years old. I've spoken to 
20110110141710.662|20110110141712.229|TR0|Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and 
20110110141712.229|20110110141713.795|TR0|offered the full resources of 
20110110141713.795|20110110141715.362|TR0|the federal government. The 
20110110141715.362|20110110141716.929|TR0|suspect is currently in custody, 
20110110141716.929|20110110141718.496|TR0|but we don't yet know what 
20110110141718.496|20110110141720.063|TR0|provoked this unspeakable act. 
20110110141720.063|20110110141721.630|TR0|Gabby Giffords was a friend of 
20110110141721.630|20110110141723.197|TR0|mine. She is not only an

20110110141724.764|20110110141726.331|TR0|but she is also somebody who is 
20110110141726.331|20110110141727.898|TR0|warm and caring. She is well 
20110110141727.898|20110110141729.465|TR0|liked by her colleagues and well 
20110110141729.465|20110110141731.032|TR0|liked by her constituents.

20110110141802.370|20110110141803.937|TR0|threats and acts of vandalism. A 
20110110141803.937|20110110141805.504|TR0|glass panel in her office was 
20110110141805.504|20110110141807.071|TR0|shattered, and at an outdoor 
20110110141807.071|20110110141808.638|TR0|event similar to the one where 
20110110141808.638|20110110141810.204|TR0|she was shot, a visitor dropped 
20110110141810.204|20110110141811.771|TR0|a gun. Giffords was also 
20110110141811.771|20110110141813.338|TR0|included on a controversial map

20110110141819.606|20110110141821.173|TR0|In a tweet, Palin urged 
20110110141821.173|20110110141822.740|TR0|supporters: "Don't

20110110141825.874|20110110141827.441|TR0|In March, Giffords appeared on

20110110141838.409|20110110141839.976|TR0|the last several months. Our 
20110110141839.976|20110110141841.543|TR0|office corner has really become 
20110110141841.543|20110110141843.110|TR0|an area where the Tea Party 
20110110141843.110|20110110141844.677|TR0|movement congregates. And the 
20110110141844.677|20110110141846.244|TR0|rhetoric is incredibly heated - 
20110110141846.244|20110110141847.811|TR0|not just the calls, but the 
20110110141847.811|20110110141849.377|TR0|emails, the slurs. So, I mean, 
20110110141849.377|20110110141850.944|TR0|things have really gotten spun 
20110110141850.944|20110110141852.511|TR0|up. And, I mean, you've got to 
20110110141852.511|20110110141854.078|TR0|think about it. Our democracy is 
20110110141854.078|20110110141855.645|TR0|a light - a beacon, really - 
20110110141855.645|20110110141857.212|TR0|around the world, because we 
20110110141857.212|20110110141858.779|TR0|effect change at the ballot box 
20110110141858.779|20110110141900.346|TR0|and not because of these, you 
20110110141900.346|20110110141901.913|TR0|know, outbursts of violence, in 
20110110141901.913|20110110141903.480|TR0|certain cases, and the yelling 
20110110141903.480|20110110141905.047|TR0|and the - you know, it's just - 
20110110141905.047|20110110141906.614|TR0|you know, change is important. 
20110110141906.614|20110110141908.180|TR0|It's a part of our process. But 
20110110141908.180|20110110141909.747|TR0|it's really important that we 
20110110141909.747|20110110141911.314|TR0|focus on the fact that we have a 
20110110141911.314|20110110141912.881|TR0|democratic process.

20110110141919.149|20110110141920.716|TR0|leadership, should have spoken

20110110141922.283|20110110141923.850|TR0|this violence? Or are you 
20110110141923.850|20110110141925.417|TR0|satisfied with what they've 
20110110141925.417|20110110141926.983|TR0|said? For example, the Minority 
20110110141926.983|20110110141928.550|TR0|Leader, John Boehner, was on Fox

20110110141936.385|20110110141937.952|TR0|Republican Party or the 
20110110141937.952|20110110141939.519|TR0|Democratic Party - there are 
20110110141939.519|20110110141941.086|TR0|certainly a lot of independents 
20110110141941.086|20110110141942.653|TR0|out there, that [inaudible] even 
20110110141942.653|20110110141944.220|TR0|will not resonate towards - but

20110110141945.786|20110110141947.353|TR0|our community, to say, "Look, we 
20110110141947.353|20110110141948.920|TR0|can't stand for this." I mean, 
20110110141948.920|20110110141950.487|TR0|this is a situation where people 
20110110141950.487|20110110141952.054|TR0|don't - I mean, really we need 
20110110141952.054|20110110141953.621|TR0|to realize that the rhetoric and 
20110110141953.621|20110110141955.188|TR0|firing people up and, you know, 
20110110141955.188|20110110141956.755|TR0|even things - for example, we're

20110110142003.023|20110110142004.590|TR0|our district. When people do 
20110110142004.590|20110110142006.156|TR0|that, they've got to realize 
20110110142006.156|20110110142007.723|TR0|there's consequences to that

20110110142115.101|20110110142116.668|TR0|the victims are doing well and 
20110110142116.668|20110110142118.235|TR0|the optimism that is being 
20110110142118.235|20110110142119.802|TR0|expressed by the doctors 
20110110142119.802|20110110142121.368|TR0|regarding Gabby's recovery is 
20110110142121.368|20110110142122.935|TR0|prayers answered and very good 
20110110142122.935|20110110142124.502|TR0|to hear. And for the people that 
20110110142124.502|20110110142126.069|TR0|were killed, what a sad moment. 
20110110142126.069|20110110142127.636|TR0|You can't really fathom the 
20110110142127.636|20110110142129.203|TR0|amount of distress that it's 
20110110142129.203|20110110142130.770|TR0|caused everybody, but you can 
20110110142130.770|20110110142132.337|TR0|appreciate the fact that, for 
20110110142132.337|20110110142133.904|TR0|all of us, it is now becoming a 
20110110142133.904|20110110142135.471|TR0|very sobering time to think 
20110110142135.471|20110110142137.038|TR0|about not only what has 
20110110142137.038|20110110142138.605|TR0|happened, but what we're going 
20110110142138.605|20110110142140.172|TR0|to do about this.
20110110142140.172|20110110142141.738|TR0|
20110110142141.738|20110110142143.305|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Gabe Zimmerman, 
20110110142143.305|20110110142144.872|TR0|the social worker who was the 
20110110142144.872|20110110142146.439|TR0|aide to Congressmember Giffords 
20110110142146.439|20110110142148.006|TR0|who was killed, you knew his 
20110110142148.006|20110110142149.573|TR0|family well.
20110110142149.573|20110110142151.140|TR0|
20110110142151.140|20110110142152.707|TR0|>> REP. RAUL GRIJALVA: Yeah, his 
20110110142152.707|20110110142154.274|TR0|mom, Emily. The world is so 
20110110142154.274|20110110142155.841|TR0|strange and connected. His mom 
20110110142155.841|20110110142157.408|TR0|was my first boss, when I got a 
20110110142157.408|20110110142158.975|TR0|real job, and - for the City of 
20110110142158.975|20110110142200.541|TR0|Tucson. And I consider her a 
20110110142200.541|20110110142202.108|TR0|dear friend. She just retired. 
20110110142202.108|20110110142203.675|TR0|Gabe was a good public servant 
20110110142203.675|20110110142205.242|TR0|and a young man with a great 
20110110142205.242|20110110142206.809|TR0|personal future and a great 
20110110142206.809|20110110142208.376|TR0|public future. And what a loss 
20110110142208.376|20110110142209.943|TR0|for all of us and all of us in 
20110110142209.943|20110110142211.510|TR0|our community.

20110110142213.077|20110110142214.644|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Tell us about 
20110110142214.644|20110110142216.211|TR0|Judge John Roll, who was killed.
20110110142216.211|20110110142217.778|TR0|
20110110142217.778|20110110142219.344|TR0|>> REP. RAUL GRIJALVA: Forty 
20110110142219.344|20110110142220.911|TR0|years in the justice system, a 
20110110142220.911|20110110142222.478|TR0|chief justice, appointed by 
20110110142222.478|20110110142224.045|TR0|first President Bush, a fair 
20110110142224.045|20110110142225.612|TR0|man, many difficult cases, 
20110110142225.612|20110110142227.179|TR0|constantly pushing for resources 
20110110142227.179|20110110142228.746|TR0|because of the huge workload in 
20110110142228.746|20110110142230.313|TR0|that court regarding district 
20110110142230.313|20110110142231.880|TR0|cases of immigration, drug 
20110110142231.880|20110110142233.447|TR0|cases, horribly overworked 
20110110142233.447|20110110142235.014|TR0|court. And John, in front of the 
20110110142235.014|20110110142236.581|TR0|Senate and in front of Congress, 
20110110142236.581|20110110142238.147|TR0|constantly pushing for not only 
20110110142238.147|20110110142239.714|TR0|resources, but for attention to 
20110110142239.714|20110110142241.281|TR0|that region, that he felt his 
20110110142241.281|20110110142242.848|TR0|court was under siege, given all 
20110110142242.848|20110110142244.415|TR0|the activity going around drugs 
20110110142244.415|20110110142245.982|TR0|and immigration enforcement. And 
20110110142245.982|20110110142247.549|TR0|an advocate, good family man, 
20110110142247.549|20110110142249.116|TR0|and admired by many, many people.
20110110142249.116|20110110142250.683|TR0|
20110110142250.683|20110110142252.250|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, he, 
20110110142252.250|20110110142253.817|TR0|himself, was under protection, 
20110110142253.817|20110110142255.384|TR0|his family. He was a 
20110110142255.384|20110110142256.950|TR0|conservative judge, but on the 
20110110142256.950|20110110142258.517|TR0|issue of immigration, he had 
20110110142258.517|20110110142300.084|TR0|stood up for immigrants and was 
20110110142300.084|20110110142301.651|TR0|seriously threatened.
20110110142301.651|20110110142303.218|TR0|
20110110142303.218|20110110142304.785|TR0|>> REP. RAUL GRIJALVA: Yeah. He 
20110110142304.785|20110110142306.352|TR0|was fair. And I think he also 
20110110142306.352|20110110142307.919|TR0|had some difficult cases that he 
20110110142307.919|20110110142309.486|TR0|was going to preside over 
20110110142309.486|20110110142311.053|TR0|relative to immigration and 
20110110142311.053|20110110142312.620|TR0|ethnic studies in the state. And 
20110110142312.620|20110110142314.187|TR0|I think, as a consequence of the 
20110110142314.187|20110110142315.754|TR0|profile cases and his rulings, 
20110110142315.754|20110110142317.320|TR0|which were consistent with law, 
20110110142317.320|20110110142318.887|TR0|he received those threats. And 
20110110142318.887|20110110142320.454|TR0|that's just - that just adds 
20110110142320.454|20110110142322.021|TR0|another chapter to this whole 
20110110142322.021|20110110142323.588|TR0|sad and frightening aspect to 
20110110142323.588|20110110142325.155|TR0|our political life and our 
20110110142325.155|20110110142326.722|TR0|public life now in this 
20110110142326.722|20110110142328.289|TR0|community and, quite frankly, in 
20110110142328.289|20110110142329.856|TR0|this country.
20110110142329.856|20110110142331.423|TR0|
20110110142331.423|20110110142332.990|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20110110142332.990|20110110142334.557|TR0|about how you're feeling right 
20110110142334.557|20110110142336.123|TR0|now in terms of your own safety? 
20110110142336.123|20110110142337.690|TR0|I know this is an issue for 
20110110142337.690|20110110142339.257|TR0|Congress members across the 
20110110142339.257|20110110142340.824|TR0|country. A conference call 
20110110142340.824|20110110142342.391|TR0|yesterday with 800 people on it 
20110110142342.391|20110110142343.958|TR0|that -
20110110142343.958|20110110142345.525|TR0|
20110110142345.525|20110110142347.092|TR0|>> REP. RAUL GRIJALVA: Yes.
20110110142347.092|20110110142348.659|TR0|
20110110142348.659|20110110142350.226|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: - House Speaker 
20110110142350.226|20110110142351.793|TR0|Boehner presided over. But you, 
20110110142351.793|20110110142353.360|TR0|yourself, have been threatened - 
20110110142353.360|20110110142354.926|TR0|white powder, a white substance, 
20110110142354.926|20110110142356.493|TR0|sent to your office. Like 
20110110142356.493|20110110142358.060|TR0|Congressmember Giffords, your 
20110110142358.060|20110110142359.627|TR0|window was smashed - yours in 
20110110142359.627|20110110142401.194|TR0|Yuma, hers in Tucson. I earlier 
20110110142401.194|20110110142402.761|TR0|- I mentioned American 
20110110142402.761|20110110142404.328|TR0|Renaissance, a group that - it 
20110110142404.328|20110110142405.895|TR0|is not clear if there is a 
20110110142405.895|20110110142407.462|TR0|connection here. Clearly, Jared 
20110110142407.462|20110110142409.029|TR0|Loughner is an extremely 
20110110142409.029|20110110142410.596|TR0|disturbed young man. But what 
20110110142410.596|20110110142412.163|TR0|about this level of antagonism?
20110110142412.163|20110110142413.729|TR0|
20110110142413.729|20110110142415.296|TR0|>> REP. RAUL GRIJALVA: You have 
20110110142415.296|20110110142416.863|TR0|a cauldron that has been brewing 
20110110142416.863|20110110142418.430|TR0|and being stirred for close to a 
20110110142418.430|20110110142419.997|TR0|decade in Arizona that has to do 
20110110142419.997|20110110142421.564|TR0|with the issue - recently the 
20110110142421.564|20110110142423.131|TR0|issue of healthcare, but 
20110110142423.131|20110110142424.698|TR0|consistently around the issue of 
20110110142424.698|20110110142426.265|TR0|immigration and the border. And 
20110110142426.265|20110110142427.832|TR0|that has become polarizing, 
20110110142427.832|20110110142429.399|TR0|divisive. The rhetoric has been 
20110110142429.399|20110110142430.966|TR0|ugly and very, very disturbing 
20110110142430.966|20110110142432.532|TR0|and divisive and angry and 
20110110142432.532|20110110142434.099|TR0|hateful. And you mix all that 
20110110142434.099|20110110142435.666|TR0|together, and whether there is a 
20110110142435.666|20110110142437.233|TR0|linkage or not - and I hope 
20110110142437.233|20110110142438.800|TR0|myself that there is no linkage, 
20110110142438.800|20110110142440.367|TR0|that this is just a deranged 
20110110142440.367|20110110142441.934|TR0|young man that did a despicable 
20110110142441.934|20110110142443.501|TR0|act - but the fact remains that 
20110110142443.501|20110110142445.068|TR0|there's a tone and a tenor 
20110110142445.068|20110110142446.635|TR0|that's been set in our national 
20110110142446.635|20110110142448.202|TR0|dialogue that we cannot get away 
20110110142448.202|20110110142449.769|TR0|from. And I think that's the 
20110110142449.769|20110110142451.336|TR0|reflection that each member of 
20110110142451.336|20110110142452.902|TR0|Congress, each governor and the 
20110110142452.902|20110110142454.469|TR0|leadership in our state better 
20110110142454.469|20110110142456.036|TR0|take very seriously, that it is 
20110110142456.036|20110110142457.603|TR0|- words have consequences, as 
20110110142457.603|20110110142459.170|TR0|Gabby said, and setting a tone, 
20110110142459.170|20110110142500.737|TR0|whether it is through the shock 
20110110142500.737|20110110142502.304|TR0|radio disc jockeys in Arizona 
20110110142502.304|20110110142503.871|TR0|and elsewhere, where they 
20110110142503.871|20110110142505.438|TR0|continue to promote a 
20110110142505.438|20110110142507.005|TR0|divisiveness and a hatred, and 
20110110142507.005|20110110142508.572|TR0|then you have people that are 
20110110142508.572|20110110142510.139|TR0|listening - and I'm not going to 
20110110142510.139|20110110142511.705|TR0|draw the linkage, but in frail 
20110110142511.705|20110110142513.272|TR0|minds and frail circumstances, 
20110110142513.272|20110110142514.839|TR0|where you have demonized people, 
20110110142514.839|20110110142516.406|TR0|where you have made a politician 
20110110142516.406|20110110142517.973|TR0|that disagrees with you not just 
20110110142517.973|20110110142519.540|TR0|your opponent, your deadly

20110110142521.107|20110110142522.674|TR0|consequences. You develop a

20110110142527.375|20110110142528.942|TR0|that they have some shared 
20110110142528.942|20110110142530.508|TR0|responsibility. This is not 
20110110142530.508|20110110142532.075|TR0|about abridging free speech. 
20110110142532.075|20110110142533.642|TR0|This is not about the right to 
20110110142533.642|20110110142535.209|TR0|petition our government. This is 
20110110142535.209|20110110142536.776|TR0|not about the right to assemble. 
20110110142536.776|20110110142538.343|TR0|This is about responsibility.

20110110142544.611|20110110142546.178|TR0|be healthy. They should be hard 
20110110142546.178|20110110142547.745|TR0|fought. But we don't demonize, 
20110110142547.745|20110110142549.311|TR0|and we do not make people our

20110110142729.594|20110110142731.161|TR0|She needed to do what she does

20110110142824.436|20110110142826.003|TR0|that the division and the 
20110110142826.003|20110110142827.570|TR0|polarization is stark and deep.

20110110142830.704|20110110142832.271|TR0|politics in Arizona have become

20110110143342.521|20110110143344.088|TR0|Sheriff Dupnik now joins us on 
20110110143344.088|20110110143345.655|TR0|the telephone from Tucson.
20110110143345.655|20110110143347.221|TR0|
20110110143347.221|20110110143348.788|TR0|Welcome to Democracy Now! Our 
20110110143348.788|20110110143350.355|TR0|condolences on this horrible 
20110110143350.355|20110110143351.922|TR0|tragedy. I wanted to go to your 
20110110143351.922|20110110143353.489|TR0|statement that Arizona is "the 
20110110143353.489|20110110143355.056|TR0|tombstone of the United States 
20110110143355.056|20110110143356.623|TR0|of America," when it comes to 
20110110143356.623|20110110143358.190|TR0|gun laws in this country. 
20110110143358.190|20110110143359.757|TR0|Arizona is only one of three 
20110110143359.757|20110110143401.324|TR0|states in this country that have 
20110110143401.324|20110110143402.891|TR0|laws that allow you to carry a 
20110110143402.891|20110110143404.458|TR0|concealed weapon without a 
20110110143404.458|20110110143406.024|TR0|permit in public. Talk about 
20110110143406.024|20110110143407.591|TR0|these laws, Sheriff Dupnik.

20110110143409.158|20110110143410.725|TR0|>> SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK: 
20110110143410.725|20110110143412.292|TR0|Well, Arizona is an ultra-right, 
20110110143412.292|20110110143413.859|TR0|ultra-conservative state. And I 
20110110143413.859|20110110143415.426|TR0|think it is victimized by the 
20110110143415.426|20110110143416.993|TR0|gun lobby. Our legislators don't 
20110110143416.993|20110110143418.560|TR0|seem capable of doing anything 
20110110143418.560|20110110143420.127|TR0|reasonable when it comes to 
20110110143420.127|20110110143421.694|TR0|weapons in this state. And as 
20110110143421.694|20110110143423.261|TR0|you heard on the clip, there's a 
20110110143423.261|20110110143424.827|TR0|bill put into the legislature, 
20110110143424.827|20110110143426.394|TR0|as we speak, that would allow 
20110110143426.394|20110110143427.961|TR0|teachers and students to carry 
20110110143427.961|20110110143429.528|TR0|weapons concealed in the 
20110110143429.528|20110110143431.095|TR0|classrooms. And to me, it's 
20110110143431.095|20110110143432.662|TR0|insane.
20110110143432.662|20110110143434.229|TR0|
20110110143434.229|20110110143435.796|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: The history of 
20110110143435.796|20110110143437.363|TR0|this - Janet Napolitano, the 
20110110143437.363|20110110143438.930|TR0|head of the Department of 
20110110143438.930|20110110143440.497|TR0|Homeland Security, had vetoed 
20110110143440.497|20110110143442.064|TR0|efforts in the past, but when 
20110110143442.064|20110110143443.631|TR0|Janet - when Governor Brewer 
20110110143443.631|20110110143445.197|TR0|came into office, she signed a 
20110110143445.197|20110110143446.764|TR0|bill that made Arizona not only 
20110110143446.764|20110110143448.331|TR0|the third state, after Alaska 
20110110143448.331|20110110143449.898|TR0|and Vermont, to make it legal to 
20110110143449.898|20110110143451.465|TR0|carry a concealed weapon without 
20110110143451.465|20110110143453.032|TR0|a permit, but she has also 
20110110143453.032|20110110143454.599|TR0|signed a bill allowing loaded 
20110110143454.599|20110110143456.166|TR0|guns in bars and restaurants and 
20110110143456.166|20110110143457.733|TR0|another bill that prohibits 
20110110143457.733|20110110143459.300|TR0|property owners from banning 
20110110143459.300|20110110143500.867|TR0|guns from parking areas, as long 
20110110143500.867|20110110143502.434|TR0|as the weapons are kept locked 
20110110143502.434|20110110143504.000|TR0|in vehicles. Do you think these 
20110110143504.000|20110110143505.567|TR0|laws need to be revoked, need to 
20110110143505.567|20110110143507.134|TR0|be changed?
20110110143507.134|20110110143508.701|TR0|
20110110143508.701|20110110143510.268|TR0|>> SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK: 
20110110143510.268|20110110143511.835|TR0|Well, there is absolutely no 
20110110143511.835|20110110143513.402|TR0|chance that that's going to 
20110110143513.402|20110110143514.969|TR0|happen in the state of Arizona. 
20110110143514.969|20110110143516.536|TR0|But we can't get the legislature 
20110110143516.536|20110110143518.103|TR0|to pass a law against texting 
20110110143518.103|20110110143519.670|TR0|while driving. That's how, in my 
20110110143519.670|20110110143521.237|TR0|judgment, ridiculously things 
20110110143521.237|20110110143522.803|TR0|have become in our state.
20110110143522.803|20110110143524.370|TR0|
20110110143524.370|20110110143525.937|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You've been 
20110110143525.937|20110110143527.504|TR0|extremely strong, Sheriff 
20110110143527.504|20110110143529.071|TR0|Dupnik, about the political 
20110110143529.071|20110110143530.638|TR0|climate in Arizona, particularly 
20110110143530.638|20110110143532.205|TR0|the state of TV and radio talk 
20110110143532.205|20110110143533.772|TR0|shows. Explain exactly what you 
20110110143533.772|20110110143535.339|TR0|mean.
20110110143535.339|20110110143536.906|TR0|
20110110143536.906|20110110143538.473|TR0|>> SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK: 
20110110143538.473|20110110143540.040|TR0|Well, I think that there are a 
20110110143540.040|20110110143541.606|TR0|lot of people in the radio 
20110110143541.606|20110110143543.173|TR0|industry, especially, and some 
20110110143543.173|20110110143544.740|TR0|in the TV industry, who make 
20110110143544.740|20110110143546.307|TR0|millions of dollars off of 
20110110143546.307|20110110143547.874|TR0|inflaming the public, purveying 
20110110143547.874|20110110143549.441|TR0|hate against the government, and 
20110110143549.441|20110110143551.008|TR0|distrust. And in some cases, we 
20110110143551.008|20110110143552.575|TR0|have political candidates who 
20110110143552.575|20110110143554.142|TR0|say, "Maybe if we can't solve 
20110110143554.142|20110110143555.709|TR0|these problems, we need to 
20110110143555.709|20110110143557.276|TR0|consider the Second Amendment as 
20110110143557.276|20110110143558.843|TR0|a solution," or we have 
20110110143558.843|20110110143600.409|TR0|high-profile people saying, 
20110110143600.409|20110110143601.976|TR0|"People like Gabrielle Giffords, 
20110110143601.976|20110110143603.543|TR0|we need to keep in the 
20110110143603.543|20110110143605.110|TR0|crosshairs." And in my judgment, 
20110110143605.110|20110110143606.677|TR0|these kinds of statements are 
20110110143606.677|20110110143608.244|TR0|totally irresponsible, and there 
20110110143608.244|20110110143609.811|TR0|are consequences associated with 
20110110143609.811|20110110143611.378|TR0|them.

20110110143614.512|20110110143616.079|TR0|I want to play a clip of 
20110110143616.079|20110110143617.646|TR0|Republican senator Jon Kyl of 
20110110143617.646|20110110143619.213|TR0|Arizona. He was interviewed on 
20110110143619.213|20110110143620.779|TR0|CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday. 
20110110143620.779|20110110143622.346|TR0|Bob Schieffer questioned him 
20110110143622.346|20110110143623.913|TR0|about your comments.
20110110143623.913|20110110143625.480|TR0|
20110110143625.480|20110110143627.047|TR0|>> BOB SCHIEFFER: The Sheriff of 
20110110143627.047|20110110143628.614|TR0|Pima County blamed the vitriolic 
20110110143628.614|20110110143630.181|TR0|political rhetoric that has 
20110110143630.181|20110110143631.748|TR0|consumed the country - that is 
20110110143631.748|20110110143633.315|TR0|his phrase - for this happening. 
20110110143633.315|20110110143634.882|TR0|Do you feel that that was a part 
20110110143634.882|20110110143636.449|TR0|of this?
20110110143636.449|20110110143638.016|TR0|
20110110143638.016|20110110143639.582|TR0|>> SEN. JON KYL: First, I didn't 
20110110143639.582|20110110143641.149|TR0|really think that that had any 
20110110143641.149|20110110143642.716|TR0|part in a law enforcement 
20110110143642.716|20110110143644.283|TR0|briefing last night. It was 
20110110143644.283|20110110143645.850|TR0|speculation. And I don't think 
20110110143645.850|20110110143647.417|TR0|we should rush to speculate. I 
20110110143647.417|20110110143648.984|TR0|thought that the report that we 
20110110143648.984|20110110143650.551|TR0|just saw from Tucson seems to 
20110110143650.551|20110110143652.118|TR0|have it about right. We really 
20110110143652.118|20110110143653.685|TR0|don't know what motivated this 
20110110143653.685|20110110143655.252|TR0|young person, except to know 
20110110143655.252|20110110143656.819|TR0|that he was very mentally 
20110110143656.819|20110110143658.385|TR0|unstable.

20110110143709.354|20110110143710.921|TR0|response is, precisely what I 
20110110143710.921|20110110143712.488|TR0|said before, I stand by. In my 
20110110143712.488|20110110143714.055|TR0|judgment, people who are 
20110110143714.055|20110110143715.622|TR0|mentally unstable are very 
20110110143715.622|20110110143717.188|TR0|susceptible to the kind of 
20110110143717.188|20110110143718.755|TR0|rhetoric that's going on in our 
20110110143718.755|20110110143720.322|TR0|country. And I think that we all 
20110110143720.322|20110110143721.889|TR0|have a responsibility to take a 
20110110143721.889|20110110143723.456|TR0|look at that. I think it's sad, 
20110110143723.456|20110110143725.023|TR0|the state that America has 
20110110143725.023|20110110143726.590|TR0|become, where we have a 
20110110143726.590|20110110143728.157|TR0|political system that, in my 
20110110143728.157|20110110143729.724|TR0|judgment, is totally broken. And 
20110110143729.724|20110110143731.291|TR0|anger plays a large role in the 
20110110143731.291|20110110143732.858|TR0|things that are going on. And 
20110110143732.858|20110110143734.425|TR0|there are people who play to the 
20110110143734.425|20110110143735.991|TR0|anger in our people and who 
20110110143735.991|20110110143737.558|TR0|encourage it.

20110110143751.661|20110110143753.228|TR0|
20110110143753.228|20110110143754.795|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: One is, what 
20110110143754.795|20110110143756.361|TR0|about the fact that Jared 
20110110143756.361|20110110143757.928|TR0|Loughner, who was kicked out of 
20110110143757.928|20110110143759.495|TR0|Pima County - at least, 
20110110143759.495|20110110143801.062|TR0|suspended - Pima County College, 
20110110143801.062|20110110143802.629|TR0|as mentally unstable, a 
20110110143802.629|20110110143804.196|TR0|potential danger to himself and 
20110110143804.196|20110110143805.763|TR0|others, clearly a problem - how 
20110110143805.763|20110110143807.330|TR0|was he able to purchase a gun in 
20110110143807.330|20110110143808.897|TR0|Tucson?
20110110143808.897|20110110143810.464|TR0|
20110110143810.464|20110110143812.031|TR0|>> SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK: 
20110110143812.031|20110110143813.598|TR0|Well, he could have purchased a 
20110110143813.598|20110110143815.164|TR0|gun anywhere in the United 
20110110143815.164|20110110143816.731|TR0|States of America, based on the 
20110110143816.731|20110110143818.298|TR0|laws that we have. Mental 
20110110143818.298|20110110143819.865|TR0|incompetency is a reason to 
20110110143819.865|20110110143821.432|TR0|disqualify a person, but you 
20110110143821.432|20110110143822.999|TR0|have to be declared mentally 
20110110143822.999|20110110143824.566|TR0|incompetent by the court system. 
20110110143824.566|20110110143826.133|TR0|And he has not been declared 
20110110143826.133|20110110143827.700|TR0|mentally incompetent. And there 
20110110143827.700|20110110143829.267|TR0|are millions - maybe I overstate 
20110110143829.267|20110110143830.834|TR0|- maybe tens of thousands of 
20110110143830.834|20110110143832.401|TR0|people just like this individual 
20110110143832.401|20110110143833.967|TR0|in our country that are 
20110110143833.967|20110110143835.534|TR0|vulnerable, make our politicians 
20110110143835.534|20110110143837.101|TR0|especially vulnerable. I know 
20110110143837.101|20110110143838.668|TR0|that in Congress, there's 
20110110143838.668|20110110143840.235|TR0|considerable angst as to what 
20110110143840.235|20110110143841.802|TR0|happened in Tucson, Arizona. And 
20110110143841.802|20110110143843.369|TR0|I think they all realize that 
20110110143843.369|20110110143844.936|TR0|when they're out of public, they 
20110110143844.936|20110110143846.503|TR0|are very rarely - unless there's 
20110110143846.503|20110110143848.070|TR0|some specific information or 
20110110143848.070|20110110143849.637|TR0|intelligence that there may be a 
20110110143849.637|20110110143851.204|TR0|problem, they are unprotected. 
20110110143851.204|20110110143852.770|TR0|And I think that we need to take 
20110110143852.770|20110110143854.337|TR0|a look at how we can do a better 
20110110143854.337|20110110143855.904|TR0|job in law enforcement of 
20110110143855.904|20110110143857.471|TR0|protecting our elected officials

20110110144115.360|20110110144116.927|TR0|there is also a sense of 
20110110144116.927|20110110144118.494|TR0|reconsidering the sort of 
20110110144118.494|20110110144120.061|TR0|slippery slope, a weakening of 
20110110144120.061|20110110144121.628|TR0|the gun laws they have in the 
20110110144121.628|20110110144123.195|TR0|state, especially over the past 
20110110144123.195|20110110144124.762|TR0|two years. As you've already 
20110110144124.762|20110110144126.328|TR0|mentioned, in the spring of 
20110110144126.328|20110110144127.895|TR0|2009, Governor Brewer, of 
20110110144127.895|20110110144129.462|TR0|course, passed a law that 
20110110144129.462|20110110144131.029|TR0|allowed concealed weapons to be 
20110110144131.029|20110110144132.596|TR0|allowed in bars and restaurants 
20110110144132.596|20110110144134.163|TR0|that serve alcohol. A year 
20110110144134.163|20110110144135.730|TR0|later, of course, last year, she 
20110110144135.730|20110110144137.297|TR0|passed a law that allows us to 
20110110144137.297|20110110144138.864|TR0|have concealed weapons without 
20110110144138.864|20110110144140.431|TR0|permits, but also to sell 
20110110144140.431|20110110144141.998|TR0|manufactured guns and ammunition 
20110110144141.998|20110110144143.565|TR0|in Arizona without any federal

20110110144156.100|20110110144157.667|TR0|which essentially will allow

20110110144203.934|20110110144205.501|TR0|residents, are really beginning 
20110110144205.501|20110110144207.068|TR0|to reconsider this lethal 
20110110144207.068|20110110144208.635|TR0|combination of not only 
20110110144208.635|20110110144210.202|TR0|hate-filled speech, but 
20110110144210.202|20110110144211.769|TR0|dangerous and easy access to

20110110144216.470|20110110144218.037|TR0|returned to Tucson. You grew up 
20110110144218.037|20110110144219.604|TR0|there and wrote a piece for the 
20110110144219.604|20110110144221.171|TR0|Huffington Post this weekend on 
20110110144221.171|20110110144222.737|TR0|your experiences with guns 
20110110144222.737|20110110144224.304|TR0|growing up.

20110110144225.871|20110110144227.438|TR0|>> JEFF BIGGERS: Right. Right. I 
20110110144227.438|20110110144229.005|TR0|mean, this is a gun state. I 
20110110144229.005|20110110144230.572|TR0|think across the nation, not 
20110110144230.572|20110110144232.139|TR0|only in Arizona, we all grow up 
20110110144232.139|20110110144233.706|TR0|with guns. I had my first gun - 
20110110144233.706|20110110144235.273|TR0|fired my first gun when I was 
20110110144235.273|20110110144236.840|TR0|eight years old at a summer camp 
20110110144236.840|20110110144238.407|TR0|with the YMCA here in Tucson, 
20110110144238.407|20110110144239.974|TR0|Arizona. And I cut my political 
20110110144239.974|20110110144241.540|TR0|teeth, for example, when I was 
20110110144241.540|20110110144243.107|TR0|17 with Congressman Morris K. 
20110110144243.107|20110110144244.674|TR0|Udall, who was a very proud 
20110110144244.674|20110110144246.241|TR0|member of the NRA who defended 
20110110144246.241|20110110144247.808|TR0|gun rights. But I think we see a 
20110110144247.808|20110110144249.375|TR0|huge difference between the 
20110110144249.375|20110110144250.942|TR0|right to own a weapon to go 
20110110144250.942|20110110144252.509|TR0|hunting or to defend yourself 
20110110144252.509|20110110144254.076|TR0|and the right for mentally 
20110110144254.076|20110110144255.643|TR0|disturbed people to purchase

20110110144344.217|20110110144345.784|TR0|numbers, you see his references 
20110110144345.784|20110110144347.351|TR0|to grammar as a way the 
20110110144347.351|20110110144348.918|TR0|government controls us, and you

20110110144352.052|20110110144353.619|TR0|what he's talking about?
20110110144353.619|20110110144355.186|TR0|
20110110144355.186|20110110144356.753|TR0|>> CHIP BERLET: Well, only 
20110110144356.753|20110110144358.319|TR0|partially. Clearly, he's 
20110110144358.319|20110110144359.886|TR0|mentally unbalanced. He picks up 
20110110144359.886|20110110144401.453|TR0|a lot of themes of people who 
20110110144401.453|20110110144403.020|TR0|are very troubled and anxious. 
20110110144403.020|20110110144404.587|TR0|You know, I can't diagnose him, 
20110110144404.587|20110110144406.154|TR0|but I think this is someone who 
20110110144406.154|20110110144407.721|TR0|is disturbed.
20110110144407.721|20110110144409.288|TR0|
20110110144409.288|20110110144410.855|TR0|That said, why did he pick the 
20110110144410.855|20110110144412.422|TR0|target he picked? And the 
20110110144412.422|20110110144413.989|TR0|answer, I think, is found in 
20110110144413.989|20110110144415.556|TR0|some of his obsessions with 
20110110144415.556|20110110144417.122|TR0|things like currency, with 
20110110144417.122|20110110144418.689|TR0|federal manipulation of money, 
20110110144418.689|20110110144420.256|TR0|with the idea of a second 
20110110144420.256|20110110144421.823|TR0|American Constitution, which is 
20110110144421.823|20110110144423.390|TR0|used in the Patriot and 
20110110144423.390|20110110144424.957|TR0|far-right movements to describe

20110110144434.359|20110110144435.926|TR0|basically conspiracies in which 
20110110144435.926|20110110144437.492|TR0|the government is oppressing the 
20110110144437.492|20110110144439.059|TR0|people and, perhaps in his mind, 
20110110144439.059|20110110144440.626|TR0|engaging in mind control on 
20110110144440.626|20110110144442.193|TR0|behalf of vested interests who 
20110110144442.193|20110110144443.760|TR0|control the money. This is a 
20110110144443.760|20110110144445.327|TR0|longstanding right-wing

20110110144456.295|20110110144457.862|TR0|points out, comes from a Patriot 
20110110144457.862|20110110144459.429|TR0|icon named David Wynn Miller of 
20110110144459.429|20110110144500.996|TR0|Milwaukee, who has a whole 
20110110144500.996|20110110144502.563|TR0|website talking about the use of 
20110110144502.563|20110110144504.130|TR0|grammar and numbers as a way of 
20110110144504.130|20110110144505.697|TR0|mind control to keep people from 
20110110144505.697|20110110144507.264|TR0|focusing on the great Federal 
20110110144507.264|20110110144508.831|TR0|Reserve conspiracy theory. The 
20110110144508.831|20110110144510.398|TR0|idea that the Federal Reserve 
20110110144510.398|20110110144511.965|TR0|was created as part of a vast 
20110110144511.965|20110110144513.532|TR0|conspiracy is not just embedded 
20110110144513.532|20110110144515.098|TR0|in the minds of people who are 
20110110144515.098|20110110144516.665|TR0|disturbed, but it's widely 
20110110144516.665|20110110144518.232|TR0|shared on, you know, Alex Jones'

20110110144519.799|20110110144521.366|TR0|representative Ron Paul. So, 
20110110144521.366|20110110144522.933|TR0|what we have here is a 
20110110144522.933|20110110144524.500|TR0|right-wing milieu in which Mr. 
20110110144524.500|20110110144526.067|TR0|Loughner apparently wandered 
20110110144526.067|20110110144527.634|TR0|through and posted information

20110110144537.035|20110110144538.602|TR0|abortion, and he stood up and 
20110110144538.602|20110110144540.169|TR0|said something about killing her 
20110110144540.169|20110110144541.736|TR0|baby and just started to laugh. 
20110110144541.736|20110110144543.303|TR0|But can you talk about where 
20110110144543.303|20110110144544.870|TR0|anti-choice activism fits in

20110110144551.138|20110110144552.704|TR0|who believes this set of 
20110110144552.704|20110110144554.271|TR0|stories, abortion, gay rights, 
20110110144554.271|20110110144555.838|TR0|sexual liberalism are all part 
20110110144555.838|20110110144557.405|TR0|of a plan to destroy America by 
20110110144557.405|20110110144558.972|TR0|reducing its moral backbone and 
20110110144558.972|20110110144600.539|TR0|allowing godless ideas and alien 
20110110144600.539|20110110144602.106|TR0|ideas to infiltrate the country 
20110110144602.106|20110110144603.673|TR0|and destroy America as God's new 
20110110144603.673|20110110144605.240|TR0|promised land. So, within 
20110110144605.240|20110110144606.807|TR0|certain groups of the Christian

20110110144608.374|20110110144609.941|TR0|anti-abortion, the idea is that 
20110110144609.941|20110110144611.508|TR0|this is all part of the same 
20110110144611.508|20110110144613.074|TR0|fabric of secular humanist, 
20110110144613.074|20110110144614.641|TR0|liberal treason. And it's this 
20110110144614.641|20110110144616.208|TR0|idea that the Democrats and the 
20110110144616.208|20110110144617.775|TR0|liberals and the leftists are 
20110110144617.775|20110110144619.342|TR0|treasonous, which is creating 
20110110144619.342|20110110144620.909|TR0|this atmosphere of demonization 
20110110144620.909|20110110144622.476|TR0|and vilification.
20110110144622.476|20110110144624.043|TR0|
20110110144624.043|20110110144625.610|TR0|Back in June of 2009, I wrote a 
20110110144625.610|20110110144627.177|TR0|report called "Toxic to 
20110110144627.177|20110110144628.744|TR0|Democracy," which said - and 
20110110144628.744|20110110144630.311|TR0|I'll quote it - "Aggressive 
20110110144630.311|20110110144631.877|TR0|right-wing rhetoric targeting 
20110110144631.877|20110110144633.444|TR0|Democrats as treasonous 
20110110144633.444|20110110144635.011|TR0|encourages some unstable people 
20110110144635.011|20110110144636.578|TR0|to act out in aggression or 
20110110144636.578|20110110144638.145|TR0|violence." So this was 
20110110144638.145|20110110144639.712|TR0|predictable. Sara Robinson,

20110110144712.617|20110110144714.184|TR0|
20110110144714.184|20110110144715.751|TR0|>> CHIP BERLET: Well, I can by 
20110110144715.751|20110110144717.318|TR0|starting to say that that report 
20110110144717.318|20110110144718.885|TR0|was woefully researched and 
20110110144718.885|20110110144720.452|TR0|contained numerous errors of 
20110110144720.452|20110110144722.019|TR0|fact. American Renaissance is a 
20110110144722.019|20110110144723.586|TR0|tuxedo racist group of scholars 
20110110144723.586|20110110144725.153|TR0|and intellectuals. It is white 
20110110144725.153|20110110144726.720|TR0|supremacist. It is eugenicist. 
20110110144726.720|20110110144728.286|TR0|It believes in bloodline purity 
20110110144728.286|20110110144729.853|TR0|in America. But they had a major 
20110110144729.853|20110110144731.420|TR0|struggle over anti-Semitism, and 
20110110144731.420|20110110144732.987|TR0|the anti-Semites were thrown 
20110110144732.987|20110110144734.554|TR0|out. The reference in that 
20110110144734.554|20110110144736.121|TR0|so-called government report to 
20110110144736.121|20110110144737.688|TR0|the Zionist-occupied government, 
20110110144737.688|20110110144739.255|TR0|that's the rhetoric of the 
20110110144739.255|20110110144740.822|TR0|neo-Nazi movement. So, again, 
20110110144740.822|20110110144742.389|TR0|what we have here is a 
20110110144742.389|20110110144743.956|TR0|government document allegedly 
20110110144743.956|20110110144745.523|TR0|being circulated which 
20110110144745.523|20110110144747.090|TR0|misunderstands the politics of 
20110110144747.090|20110110144748.656|TR0|the situation, and it's just an 
20110110144748.656|20110110144750.223|TR0|error. It's entirely possible 
20110110144750.223|20110110144751.790|TR0|Mr. Loughner read their 
20110110144751.790|20110110144753.357|TR0|newsletter. It's entirely 
20110110144753.357|20110110144754.924|TR0|possible he visited their 
20110110144754.924|20110110144756.491|TR0|website. There is evidence that 
20110110144756.491|20110110144758.058|TR0|he's obsessed with immigration 
20110110144758.058|20110110144759.625|TR0|and natural-born Americans, 
20110110144759.625|20110110144801.192|TR0|natural law citizens as opposed

20110110144835.664|20110110144837.231|TR0|overturned the pre-existing 
20110110144837.231|20110110144838.798|TR0|constitution, so it became a

20110110144840.365|20110110144841.932|TR0|based on this false notion of 
20110110144841.932|20110110144843.499|TR0|equality. And so, the second 
20110110144843.499|20110110144845.065|TR0|American Constitution then begs 
20110110144845.065|20110110144846.632|TR0|the question of the need for a 
20110110144846.632|20110110144848.199|TR0|second American Revolution to 
20110110144848.199|20110110144849.766|TR0|overthrow the bogus government

20110110145022.214|20110110145023.781|TR0|radical right state legislature 
20110110145023.781|20110110145025.348|TR0|who is really obsessive and 
20110110145025.348|20110110145026.915|TR0|hell-bent on having some sort of

20110110145030.049|20110110145031.616|TR0|people here in Tucson are really 
20110110145031.616|20110110145033.183|TR0|trying to come to grips of how 
20110110145033.183|20110110145034.750|TR0|there can be more public events

20110110145143.694|20110110145145.261|TR0|partially. Clearly, he's 
20110110145145.261|20110110145146.828|TR0|mentally unbalanced. He picks up 
20110110145146.828|20110110145148.395|TR0|a lot of themes of people who 
20110110145148.395|20110110145149.962|TR0|are very troubled and anxious. 
20110110145149.962|20110110145151.529|TR0|You know, I can't diagnose him,

20110110145153.096|20110110145154.663|TR0|is disturbed.

20110110145156.229|20110110145157.796|TR0|That said, why did he pick the 
20110110145157.796|20110110145159.363|TR0|target he picked? And the 
20110110145159.363|20110110145200.930|TR0|answer, I think, is found in 
20110110145200.930|20110110145202.497|TR0|some of his obsessions with 
20110110145202.497|20110110145204.064|TR0|things like currency, with

20110110145258.906|20110110145300.473|TR0|conspiracy is not just embedded 
20110110145300.473|20110110145302.040|TR0|in the minds of people who are 
20110110145302.040|20110110145303.607|TR0|disturbed, but it's widely 
20110110145303.607|20110110145305.174|TR0|shared on, you know, Alex Jones'

20110110145325.544|20110110145327.111|TR0|said something about killing her 
20110110145327.111|20110110145328.678|TR0|baby and just started to laugh. 
20110110145328.678|20110110145330.245|TR0|But can you talk about where

20110110145336.512|20110110145338.079|TR0|walking in the shoes of a person 
20110110145338.079|20110110145339.646|TR0|who believes this set of 
20110110145339.646|20110110145341.213|TR0|stories, abortion, gay rights, 
20110110145341.213|20110110145342.780|TR0|sexual liberalism are all part 
20110110145342.780|20110110145344.347|TR0|of a plan to destroy America by 
20110110145344.347|20110110145345.914|TR0|reducing its moral backbone and 
20110110145345.914|20110110145347.481|TR0|allowing godless ideas and alien 
20110110145347.481|20110110145349.048|TR0|ideas to infiltrate the country 
20110110145349.048|20110110145350.614|TR0|and destroy America as God's new 
20110110145350.614|20110110145352.181|TR0|promised land. So, within 
20110110145352.181|20110110145353.748|TR0|certain groups of the Christian 
20110110145353.748|20110110145355.315|TR0|right who are militantly 
20110110145355.315|20110110145356.882|TR0|anti-abortion, the idea is that 
20110110145356.882|20110110145358.449|TR0|this is all part of the same 
20110110145358.449|20110110145400.016|TR0|fabric of secular humanist, 
20110110145400.016|20110110145401.583|TR0|liberal treason. And it's this 
20110110145401.583|20110110145403.150|TR0|idea that the Democrats and the 
20110110145403.150|20110110145404.717|TR0|liberals and the leftists are 
20110110145404.717|20110110145406.284|TR0|treasonous, which is creating 
20110110145406.284|20110110145407.851|TR0|this atmosphere of demonization 
20110110145407.851|20110110145409.417|TR0|and vilification.

20110110145410.984|20110110145412.551|TR0|Back in June of 2009, I wrote a

20110110145415.685|20110110145417.252|TR0|I'll quote it - "Aggressive 
20110110145417.252|20110110145418.819|TR0|right-wing rhetoric targeting

20110110145502.693|20110110145504.260|TR0|starting to say that that report 
20110110145504.260|20110110145505.827|TR0|was woefully researched and 
20110110145505.827|20110110145507.393|TR0|contained numerous errors of 
20110110145507.393|20110110145508.960|TR0|fact. American Renaissance is a 
20110110145508.960|20110110145510.527|TR0|tuxedo racist group of scholars 
20110110145510.527|20110110145512.094|TR0|and intellectuals. It is white 
20110110145512.094|20110110145513.661|TR0|supremacist. It is eugenicist. 
20110110145513.661|20110110145515.228|TR0|It believes in bloodline purity 
20110110145515.228|20110110145516.795|TR0|in America. But they had a major 
20110110145516.795|20110110145518.362|TR0|struggle over anti-Semitism, and 
20110110145518.362|20110110145519.929|TR0|the anti-Semites were thrown 
20110110145519.929|20110110145521.496|TR0|out. The reference in that 
20110110145521.496|20110110145523.063|TR0|so-called government report to 
20110110145523.063|20110110145524.630|TR0|the Zionist-occupied government, 
20110110145524.630|20110110145526.196|TR0|that's the rhetoric of the 
20110110145526.196|20110110145527.763|TR0|neo-Nazi movement. So, again, 
20110110145527.763|20110110145529.330|TR0|what we have here is a 
20110110145529.330|20110110145530.897|TR0|government document allegedly 
20110110145530.897|20110110145532.464|TR0|being circulated which 
20110110145532.464|20110110145534.031|TR0|misunderstands the politics of 
20110110145534.031|20110110145535.598|TR0|the situation, and it's just an 
20110110145535.598|20110110145537.165|TR0|error. It's entirely possible 
20110110145537.165|20110110145538.732|TR0|Mr. Loughner read their 
20110110145538.732|20110110145540.299|TR0|newsletter. It's entirely 
20110110145540.299|20110110145541.866|TR0|possible he visited their 
20110110145541.866|20110110145543.433|TR0|website. There is evidence that 
20110110145543.433|20110110145544.999|TR0|he's obsessed with immigration 
20110110145544.999|20110110145546.566|TR0|and natural-born Americans,

20110110145622.606|20110110145624.172|TR0|overturned the pre-existing 
20110110145624.172|20110110145625.739|TR0|constitution, so it became a

20110110145628.873|20110110145630.440|TR0|equality. And so, the second 
20110110145630.440|20110110145632.007|TR0|American Constitution then begs 
20110110145632.007|20110110145633.574|TR0|the question of the need for a 
20110110145633.574|20110110145635.141|TR0|second American Revolution to 
20110110145635.141|20110110145636.708|TR0|overthrow the bogus government

20110110145709.613|20110110145711.180|TR0|be the idea that Jews own the 
20110110145711.180|20110110145712.747|TR0|banks, that there's a Zionist
