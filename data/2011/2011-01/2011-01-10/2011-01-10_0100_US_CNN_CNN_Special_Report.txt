20110110010158.000|20110110010201.000|TR0|Good evening.  I'm John King in 
20110110010201.000|20110110010203.000|TR0|Washington.  Tonight, Congresswoman 
20110110010203.000|20110110010206.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords remains in critical 
20110110010206.000|20110110010208.000|TR0|condition in a Tucson, Arizona, hospital.

20110110010215.000|20110110010218.000|TR0|our politics have changed tonight.  The 
20110110010218.000|20110110010220.000|TR0|political agenda here in Washington -- are 
20110110010220.000|20110110010223.000|TR0|public officials now talking openly about 
20110110010223.000|20110110010225.000|TR0|public safety and their safety and 
20110110010225.000|20110110010228.000|TR0|perhaps, some say, the very nature of our

20110110010252.000|20110110010254.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL 
20110110010254.000|20110110010257.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, John.  You know, here 
20110110010257.000|20110110010259.000|TR0|in Tucson, there is a mix of shock, 
20110110010259.000|20110110010302.000|TR0|sadness and some real anxiety.  I've been 
20110110010302.000|20110110010304.000|TR0|talking to various groups of people today, 
20110110010304.000|20110110010306.000|TR0|and it's hard to go anywhere without 
20110110010306.000|20110110010309.000|TR0|running into someone who has a connection 
20110110010309.000|20110110010311.000|TR0|to this tragedy.  They were either in 
20110110010311.000|20110110010314.000|TR0|church choir with one of the victims or 
20110110010314.000|20110110010316.000|TR0|someone lives around the corner.  It is a 
20110110010316.000|20110110010319.000|TR0|relatively small community.
20110110010319.000|20110110010321.000|TR0|
20110110010321.000|20110110010323.000|TR0|But there's also this anxiety because we 
20110110010323.000|20110110010326.000|TR0|still don't know the motive for this 
20110110010326.000|20110110010328.000|TR0|shooter?  Was it politically motivated?  
20110110010328.000|20110110010331.000|TR0|It leads to the questioning of our 
20110110010331.000|20110110010333.000|TR0|political rhetoric and the way we engage 
20110110010333.000|20110110010336.000|TR0|with one another, all those questions 
20110110010336.000|20110110010338.000|TR0|leaving people here feeling very, very 
20110110010338.000|20110110010340.000|TR0|uncertain and somewhat tense, John.  We 
20110110010340.000|20110110010343.000|TR0|will get to all of that, of course, in the 
20110110010343.000|20110110010345.000|TR0|hours ahead.
20110110010345.000|20110110010348.000|TR0|
20110110010348.000|20110110010350.000|TR0|I'm joined, though, by Randi Kaye.  As you 
20110110010350.000|20110110010353.000|TR0|know, Randi has been working this story 
20110110010353.000|20110110010355.000|TR0|quite aggressively.  And you have spoken 
20110110010355.000|20110110010358.000|TR0|now with a new eyewitness.
20110110010358.000|20110110010400.000|TR0|
20110110010400.000|20110110010402.000|TR0|RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We have.  
20110110010402.000|20110110010405.000|TR0|As you know, we got our first glimpse of 
20110110010405.000|20110110010407.000|TR0|the 911 tapes just being released today by 
20110110010407.000|20110110010410.000|TR0|authorities, chilling tapes from the scene 
20110110010410.000|20110110010412.000|TR0|yesterday.  And one of the people who was 
20110110010412.000|20110110010415.000|TR0|there while all of this unfolding was a 
20110110010415.000|20110110010417.000|TR0|woman named Patricia Maisch.  She's this 
20110110010417.000|20110110010419.000|TR0|eyewitness.  She said that everything was 
20110110010419.000|20110110010422.000|TR0|happening so fast.  She didn't know if she 
20110110010422.000|20110110010424.000|TR0|was going to be injured or killed or what 
20110110010424.000|20110110010427.000|TR0|she should do.
20110110010427.000|20110110010429.000|TR0|
20110110010429.000|20110110010432.000|TR0|And she was eventually credited as one of 
20110110010432.000|20110110010434.000|TR0|the people, one of the heroes, if you want 
20110110010434.000|20110110010436.000|TR0|to call them that, who helped tackle the 
20110110010436.000|20110110010439.000|TR0|suspect. She was told to grab the gun.  
20110110010439.000|20110110010441.000|TR0|She helped grab the magazine, which was 
20110110010441.000|20110110010444.000|TR0|already empty, while he was trying to 
20110110010444.000|20110110010446.000|TR0|reload and did reload that second 
20110110010446.000|20110110010449.000|TR0|magazine, which had 31 bullets in it.  And 
20110110010449.000|20110110010451.000|TR0|just by chance, the spring didn't work, 
20110110010451.000|20110110010453.000|TR0|and there was a malfunction of the gun, so 
20110110010453.000|20110110010456.000|TR0|there were no more bullets fired.
20110110010456.000|20110110010458.000|TR0|
20110110010458.000|20110110010501.000|TR0|But if you listen to her as she spoke with 
20110110010501.000|20110110010503.000|TR0|us today, you can hear just how modest she 
20110110010503.000|20110110010506.000|TR0|is about all that unfolded.

20110110010518.000|20110110010520.000|TR0|was an assistant in being able to get that 
20110110010520.000|20110110010523.000|TR0|magazine or clip -- I'm not a gun person,

20110110010527.000|20110110010530.000|TR0|clip.  And another gentleman that was 
20110110010530.000|20110110010532.000|TR0|standing up, not the two that were 
20110110010532.000|20110110010535.000|TR0|securing him, was able to get the gun.

20110110010621.000|20110110010623.000|TR0|she thought she might be a target.  So 
20110110010623.000|20110110010626.000|TR0|what did she do instead?  She actually 
20110110010626.000|20110110010628.000|TR0|stayed and not only really helped tackle 
20110110010628.000|20110110010631.000|TR0|this shooter -- alleged shooter -- but she 
20110110010631.000|20110110010633.000|TR0|also helped one of the victims who was 
20110110010633.000|20110110010636.000|TR0|bleeding from the head.
20110110010636.000|20110110010638.000|TR0|
20110110010638.000|20110110010640.000|TR0|Listen to what she told us about that.

20110110010648.000|20110110010650.000|TR0|MAISCH:  When I saw the man with the head 
20110110010650.000|20110110010653.000|TR0|wound, I was a little panicky.  And then I 
20110110010653.000|20110110010655.000|TR0|decided that wasn't -- that wasn't going 
20110110010655.000|20110110010657.000|TR0|to help. And so I just asked another man 
20110110010657.000|20110110010700.000|TR0|to sit on his ankles, and I went to get a 
20110110010700.000|20110110010702.000|TR0|compress for him.  And I stayed there 
20110110010702.000|20110110010705.000|TR0|until they -- I held the man -- held the 
20110110010705.000|20110110010707.000|TR0|compress on the man's head until the 
20110110010707.000|20110110010710.000|TR0|police secured the shooter.

20110110010717.000|20110110010719.000|TR0|KAYE:  She actually said that the woman 
20110110010719.000|20110110010722.000|TR0|who was right next to her at this event 
20110110010722.000|20110110010724.000|TR0|was shot.  She said that she saw the 
20110110010724.000|20110110010727.000|TR0|suspect actually aim and fire.  He was 
20110110010727.000|20110110010729.000|TR0|aiming down, so the woman might have been 
20110110010729.000|20110110010731.000|TR0|on the ground, and she watched him fire 
20110110010731.000|20110110010734.000|TR0|that gun at the woman sitting next to her.
20110110010734.000|20110110010736.000|TR0|
20110110010736.000|20110110010739.000|TR0|YELLIN:  You know, it's amazing what 
20110110010739.000|20110110010741.000|TR0|people are capable of in these 
20110110010741.000|20110110010744.000|TR0|extraordinary moments.  That remarkable 
20110110010744.000|20110110010746.000|TR0|woman.  Now, you also have an update on 
20110110010746.000|20110110010749.000|TR0|the status of the congresswoman.
20110110010749.000|20110110010751.000|TR0|
20110110010751.000|20110110010753.000|TR0|KAYE:  Right.  We've been here at the 
20110110010753.000|20110110010756.000|TR0|hospital.  We've been getting updates from 
20110110010756.000|20110110010758.000|TR0|the hospital.  She is still sedated.  What 
20110110010758.000|20110110010801.000|TR0|they're doing is they're keeping her 
20110110010801.000|20110110010803.000|TR0|sedated, and then bringing her out of that 
20110110010803.000|20110110010806.000|TR0|sedation every once in a while to check 
20110110010806.000|20110110010808.000|TR0|her brain function.  They say they're 
20110110010808.000|20110110010810.000|TR0|extremely optimistic, very encouraged, but 
20110110010810.000|20110110010813.000|TR0|they're also cautiously optimistic at the 
20110110010813.000|20110110010815.000|TR0|same time.
20110110010815.000|20110110010818.000|TR0|
20110110010818.000|20110110010820.000|TR0|She is the only one still listed here in 
20110110010820.000|20110110010823.000|TR0|critical condition.  She's still in the 
20110110010823.000|20110110010825.000|TR0|intensive care unit.  There are nine other 
20110110010825.000|20110110010827.000|TR0|victims here at this hospital.  Three are 
20110110010827.000|20110110010830.000|TR0|in serious condition.  Six of them are in 
20110110010830.000|20110110010832.000|TR0|fair condition.  Their greatest concern 
20110110010832.000|20110110010835.000|TR0|right now is the possible swelling of her 
20110110010835.000|20110110010837.000|TR0|brain.  So they did remove part of her 
20110110010837.000|20110110010840.000|TR0|skull, as you know, during the surgery in 
20110110010840.000|20110110010842.000|TR0|case there is pressure, in case the brain 
20110110010842.000|20110110010844.000|TR0|does swell.
20110110010844.000|20110110010847.000|TR0|
20110110010847.000|20110110010849.000|TR0|But they say that, you know, if you're 
20110110010849.000|20110110010852.000|TR0|going to be shot in the head, the way she 
20110110010852.000|20110110010854.000|TR0|was shot is actually the best way to be 
20110110010854.000|20110110010857.000|TR0|shot, if you can even say that.
20110110010857.000|20110110010859.000|TR0|
20110110010859.000|20110110010901.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Unbelievable.  OK, thank you,

20110110010904.000|20110110010906.000|TR0|developments.  I know you'll be back.  
20110110010906.000|20110110010909.000|TR0|Thanks. John, a remarkable story that she 
20110110010909.000|20110110010911.000|TR0|is still alive and doctors here are 
20110110010911.000|20110110010914.000|TR0|optimistic.  I'll toss it back to you in 
20110110010914.000|20110110010916.000|TR0|Washington.

20110110010918.000|20110110010921.000|TR0|KING:  Jess, back to you in just a moment. 
20110110010921.000|20110110010923.000|TR0| But first, important details here.  The 
20110110010923.000|20110110010926.000|TR0|criminal complaint filed today contains 
20110110010926.000|20110110010928.000|TR0|disturbing new information about what the 
20110110010928.000|20110110010931.000|TR0|shooting suspect apparently was thinking.
20110110010931.000|20110110010933.000|TR0|
20110110010933.000|20110110010936.000|TR0|CNN's Jeanne Meserve is here with the 
20110110010936.000|20110110010938.000|TR0|latest.  When you read through this, it's 
20110110010938.000|20110110010940.000|TR0|pretty stunning.
20110110010940.000|20110110010943.000|TR0|
20110110010943.000|20110110010945.000|TR0|JEANNE MESERVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, 
20110110010945.000|20110110010948.000|TR0|and what it lets you know is that if this 
20110110010948.000|20110110010950.000|TR0|document is accurate, this was targeted.  
20110110010950.000|20110110010953.000|TR0|This was an attempted assassination.  The 
20110110010953.000|20110110010955.000|TR0|document I'm referring to is the statement 
20110110010955.000|20110110010957.000|TR0|of probable cause that was filed today in 
20110110010957.000|20110110011000.000|TR0|court.  And what it says is that when they 
20110110011000.000|20110110011002.000|TR0|executed a search warrant at the home 
20110110011002.000|20110110011005.000|TR0|where Jared Loughner, the suspect, lives, 
20110110011005.000|20110110011007.000|TR0|they found in a safe an envelope with 
20110110011007.000|20110110011010.000|TR0|writing on it.  And what it said -- and 
20110110011010.000|20110110011012.000|TR0|I'm quoting here -- "I planned ahead, my 
20110110011012.000|20110110011014.000|TR0|assassination," the name Giffords, along 
20110110011014.000|20110110011017.000|TR0|with what appears to be Loughner's 
20110110011017.000|20110110011019.000|TR0|signature.
20110110011019.000|20110110011022.000|TR0|
20110110011022.000|20110110011024.000|TR0|In addition, there was another letter in 
20110110011024.000|20110110011027.000|TR0|there addressed from 2007. This was a 
20110110011027.000|20110110011029.000|TR0|letter from Congresswoman Giffords 
20110110011029.000|20110110011031.000|TR0|addressed to Jared Loughner.  And it 
20110110011031.000|20110110011034.000|TR0|appeared to be inviting him to a "Congress 
20110110011034.000|20110110011036.000|TR0|on the Corner" event.  Of course, it was a 
20110110011036.000|20110110011039.000|TR0|"Congress on the Corner" event yesterday 
20110110011039.000|20110110011041.000|TR0|where she was shot, but this was a 
20110110011041.000|20110110011044.000|TR0|different one held at a different location 
20110110011044.000|20110110011046.000|TR0|and back in 2007.  It's tantalizing.  We'd 
20110110011046.000|20110110011048.000|TR0|love to know more about what's here, but 
20110110011048.000|20110110011051.000|TR0|that's all they've included in this 
20110110011051.000|20110110011053.000|TR0|document.
20110110011053.000|20110110011056.000|TR0|
20110110011056.000|20110110011058.000|TR0|KING:  And that's what makes it hard 
20110110011058.000|20110110011101.000|TR0|because you can't read through this and 
20110110011101.000|20110110011103.000|TR0|find a motive.
20110110011103.000|20110110011105.000|TR0|
20110110011105.000|20110110011108.000|TR0|MESERVE:  No.  No.  You don't find a 
20110110011108.000|20110110011110.000|TR0|motive here, but I suspect part of the 
20110110011110.000|20110110011113.000|TR0|explanation may be right here.  What we 
20110110011113.000|20110110011115.000|TR0|also got today were the five counts that 
20110110011115.000|20110110011118.000|TR0|were filed against him, one for attempted 
20110110011118.000|20110110011120.000|TR0|murder of a member of Congress, one for 
20110110011120.000|20110110011123.000|TR0|first degree murder of a federal judge, 
20110110011123.000|20110110011125.000|TR0|Judge John Roll, first degree murder of a 
20110110011125.000|20110110011127.000|TR0|congressional Aide, Gabriel Zimmerman, and 
20110110011127.000|20110110011130.000|TR0|attempted murder of two other aids to the 
20110110011130.000|20110110011132.000|TR0|congresswoman, Pamela Simon (ph) and Ron 
20110110011132.000|20110110011135.000|TR0|Barber (ph).  But the FBI director made it 
20110110011135.000|20110110011137.000|TR0|clear that there could be additional 
20110110011137.000|20110110011140.000|TR0|charges coming, John.
20110110011140.000|20110110011142.000|TR0|
20110110011142.000|20110110011144.000|TR0|KING:  Do we know his disposition right 
20110110011144.000|20110110011147.000|TR0|now?  He was not cooperating. Have they 
20110110011147.000|20110110011149.000|TR0|had any luck in getting him to be more 
20110110011149.000|20110110011152.000|TR0|conversant?
20110110011152.000|20110110011154.000|TR0|
20110110011154.000|20110110011157.000|TR0|MESERVE:  Indications -- indications from 
20110110011157.000|20110110011159.000|TR0|the sheriff that he's not talking, but 
20110110011159.000|20110110011201.000|TR0|I've asked a number of law enforcement 
20110110011201.000|20110110011204.000|TR0|forces sources today whether he is or 
20110110011204.000|20110110011206.000|TR0|isn't.  They're not saying much about it.
20110110011206.000|20110110011209.000|TR0|
20110110011209.000|20110110011211.000|TR0|KING:  And one piece of new information is 
20110110011211.000|20110110011214.000|TR0|when he bought the Glock, the gun.
20110110011214.000|20110110011216.000|TR0|
20110110011216.000|20110110011218.000|TR0|MESERVE:  Yes, he bought it back in 
20110110011218.000|20110110011221.000|TR0|November.  He bought it legally. He bought 
20110110011221.000|20110110011223.000|TR0|it from a store called Sportsmen's (ph) 
20110110011223.000|20110110011226.000|TR0|Warehouse.  Another new piece of 
20110110011226.000|20110110011228.000|TR0|information -- we have known that the Army 
20110110011228.000|20110110011231.000|TR0|turned him away when he tried to apply 
20110110011231.000|20110110011233.000|TR0|there.  We now know that that was because 
20110110011233.000|20110110011235.000|TR0|he failed a drug test.

20110110011238.000|20110110011240.000|TR0|KING:  Jeanne Meserve, all over this 
20110110011240.000|20110110011243.000|TR0|investigation.  Jeanne, thanks so much.  
20110110011243.000|20110110011245.000|TR0|More in a little bit.

20110110011248.000|20110110011250.000|TR0|Next, a teacher who had the suspect in 
20110110011250.000|20110110011252.000|TR0|class and who says he was trouble from day 
20110110011252.000|20110110011255.000|TR0|one.  And later, we'll hear from an intern 
20110110011255.000|20110110011257.000|TR0|who's worked for Congresswoman Giffords 
20110110011257.000|20110110011300.000|TR0|less than a week and helped save her life.

20110110011312.000|20110110011314.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A kind of 
20110110011314.000|20110110011317.000|TR0|shady-looking gentleman came up, asked me 
20110110011317.000|20110110011319.000|TR0|if he could talk to the congresswoman.  So 
20110110011319.000|20110110011322.000|TR0|just like anybody else, I redirected him 
20110110011322.000|20110110011324.000|TR0|to the back of the line.  Came back about 
20110110011324.000|20110110011327.000|TR0|30 seconds later, and before I knew, he 
20110110011327.000|20110110011329.000|TR0|was barging through the tables toward the 
20110110011329.000|20110110011331.000|TR0|congresswoman.

20110110011339.000|20110110011341.000|TR0|KING:  CNN has some new details tonight 
20110110011341.000|20110110011344.000|TR0|about suspected gunman Jared Lee Loughner. 
20110110011344.000|20110110011346.000|TR0| We get the details from someone who 
20110110011346.000|20110110011348.000|TR0|taught him a class at community college.  
20110110011348.000|20110110011351.000|TR0|Back out to Jessica Yellin in Tucson for 
20110110011351.000|20110110011353.000|TR0|that -- Jess.
20110110011353.000|20110110011356.000|TR0|
20110110011356.000|20110110011358.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Hey, John.  You know, one of the 
20110110011358.000|20110110011401.000|TR0|big questions here is motivation, and 
20110110011401.000|20110110011403.000|TR0|since we don't know that, we are still 
20110110011403.000|20110110011405.000|TR0|asking many questions about the suspect 
20110110011405.000|20110110011408.000|TR0|himself.  Our own Drew Griffin was able to 
20110110011408.000|20110110011410.000|TR0|sit down, talk to someone who actually 
20110110011410.000|20110110011413.000|TR0|knew the suspect.  It was his math 
20110110011413.000|20110110011415.000|TR0|teacher.  And he sensed trouble.

20110110011418.000|20110110011420.000|TR0|DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS 
20110110011420.000|20110110011422.000|TR0|UNIT:  Trouble from the very beginning, 
20110110011422.000|20110110011425.000|TR0|Jessica.  Ben McGahee (ph) is the teacher 
20110110011425.000|20110110011427.000|TR0|of math 092 (ph) at Pima County Committee 
20110110011427.000|20110110011430.000|TR0|College, and on June 1st, the day the 
20110110011430.000|20110110011432.000|TR0|class started, at 8:00 AM, Loughner came 
20110110011432.000|20110110011435.000|TR0|into class and immediately began creating 
20110110011435.000|20110110011437.000|TR0|a disturbance.  Take a listen.
20110110011437.000|20110110011439.000|TR0|
20110110011439.000|20110110011442.000|TR0|YELLIN:  I don't -- we don't have the 
20110110011442.000|20110110011444.000|TR0|sound, so tell us what he said, if you 
20110110011444.000|20110110011447.000|TR0|would.
20110110011447.000|20110110011449.000|TR0|
20110110011449.000|20110110011452.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  He would be making outbursts in 
20110110011452.000|20110110011454.000|TR0|the class.  It happened over and over 
20110110011454.000|20110110011456.000|TR0|again.  He would say random things.  He 
20110110011456.000|20110110011459.000|TR0|would argue with the teacher.  He would 
20110110011459.000|20110110011501.000|TR0|scream out answers that were obviously 
20110110011501.000|20110110011504.000|TR0|wrong.  And when the teacher tried to gain 
20110110011504.000|20110110011506.000|TR0|control of the class, the student was very 
20110110011506.000|20110110011509.000|TR0|disruptive.  At times, he would come into 
20110110011509.000|20110110011511.000|TR0|class with an iPod on, not listening to 
20110110011511.000|20110110011514.000|TR0|anything that was said.
20110110011514.000|20110110011516.000|TR0|
20110110011516.000|20110110011518.000|TR0|Eventually, it got to the point where the 
20110110011518.000|20110110011521.000|TR0|professor and the students, the other 15 
20110110011521.000|20110110011523.000|TR0|or 20 students in the class, were 
20110110011523.000|20110110011526.000|TR0|frightened, extremely frightened that 
20110110011526.000|20110110011528.000|TR0|something like this very thing would 
20110110011528.000|20110110011531.000|TR0|happen.  They mentioned guns and were 
20110110011531.000|20110110011533.000|TR0|afraid that he was going to come back with 
20110110011533.000|20110110011535.000|TR0|a gun and kill them all.
20110110011535.000|20110110011538.000|TR0|
20110110011538.000|20110110011540.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Now, had he written something 
20110110011540.000|20110110011543.000|TR0|disturbing? GRIFFIN:  On one test, the 
20110110011543.000|20110110011545.000|TR0|math teacher said, he wrote "mayhem fest" 
20110110011545.000|20110110011548.000|TR0|in exclamation points.  That apparently -- 
20110110011548.000|20110110011550.000|TR0|we haven't had time to check it out -- was 
20110110011550.000|20110110011552.000|TR0|a reference to a heavy metal band with 
20110110011552.000|20110110011555.000|TR0|some kind of violence in tone.  But they 
20110110011555.000|20110110011557.000|TR0|were very disturbed.  They had called the 
20110110011557.000|20110110011600.000|TR0|campus police.  They had called the dean.  
20110110011600.000|20110110011602.000|TR0|And eventually -- eventually -- after two 
20110110011602.000|20110110011605.000|TR0|or three times of the police being called 
20110110011605.000|20110110011607.000|TR0|to that classroom, the student was removed 
20110110011607.000|20110110011609.000|TR0|and he was told he could not come back to 
20110110011609.000|20110110011612.000|TR0|Pima County Community College until and 
20110110011612.000|20110110011614.000|TR0|unless he had a psychiatric evaluation.
20110110011614.000|20110110011617.000|TR0|
20110110011617.000|20110110011619.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Now, do you know if this was 
20110110011619.000|20110110011622.000|TR0|because of the behavior in this one class, 
20110110011622.000|20110110011624.000|TR0|or did he say was it indicative of how he 
20110110011624.000|20110110011626.000|TR0|was with other teachers?
20110110011626.000|20110110011629.000|TR0|
20110110011629.000|20110110011631.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  He only had -- Ben McGrahee -- 
20110110011631.000|20110110011634.000|TR0|again, the math instructor -- only had him 
20110110011634.000|20110110011636.000|TR0|for this one class.  First time he ever 
20110110011636.000|20110110011639.000|TR0|met him was this summer.  And this class 
20110110011639.000|20110110011641.000|TR0|met four times a week.  He said afterwards 
20110110011641.000|20110110011643.000|TR0|Loughner went to a weight training class 
20110110011643.000|20110110011646.000|TR0|across the street at the YMCA.  He's not 
20110110011646.000|20110110011648.000|TR0|sure if there were any disturbances there. 
20110110011648.000|20110110011651.000|TR0| But he says it was based on his 
20110110011651.000|20110110011653.000|TR0|complaints, his, actually, calls to the 
20110110011653.000|20110110011656.000|TR0|campus police, which is why Loughner was 
20110110011656.000|20110110011658.000|TR0|kicked out of his school.
20110110011658.000|20110110011701.000|TR0|
20110110011701.000|20110110011703.000|TR0|And again, some of the other students -- 
20110110011703.000|20110110011705.000|TR0|they wrote e-mails, We have a seriously 
20110110011705.000|20110110011708.000|TR0|disturbed student in class.  He scares the 
20110110011708.000|20110110011710.000|TR0|crap out of me, one student wrote on June 
20110110011710.000|20110110011713.000|TR0|14th.
20110110011713.000|20110110011715.000|TR0|
20110110011715.000|20110110011718.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Oh!  It's so upsetting because, 
20110110011718.000|20110110011720.000|TR0|clearly, there were signs that there 
20110110011720.000|20110110011722.000|TR0|seemed to be some sort of mental issue 
20110110011722.000|20110110011725.000|TR0|here that could have been addressed.
20110110011725.000|20110110011727.000|TR0|
20110110011727.000|20110110011730.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Yes.
20110110011730.000|20110110011732.000|TR0|
20110110011732.000|20110110011735.000|TR0|YELLIN:  That could have been addressed.
20110110011735.000|20110110011737.000|TR0|
20110110011737.000|20110110011739.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Now, according -- this is 
20110110011739.000|20110110011742.000|TR0|according to the observations of the math 
20110110011742.000|20110110011744.000|TR0|instructor, teaching elementary algebra, 
20110110011744.000|20110110011747.000|TR0|he said he seemed at times to be high on 
20110110011747.000|20110110011749.000|TR0|some kind of drugs, was completely 
20110110011749.000|20110110011752.000|TR0|unresponsive at times.  Then at other 
20110110011752.000|20110110011754.000|TR0|times, he would just blurt things out.  So 
20110110011754.000|20110110011756.000|TR0|he was clearly disturbing the class, 
20110110011756.000|20110110011759.000|TR0|talking about the Constitution, that the 
20110110011759.000|20110110011801.000|TR0|class itself was violating his 
20110110011801.000|20110110011804.000|TR0|constitutional rights.
20110110011804.000|20110110011806.000|TR0|
20110110011806.000|20110110011809.000|TR0|Another thing we learned is, apparently, 
20110110011809.000|20110110011811.000|TR0|he had flunked this class already and was 
20110110011811.000|20110110011813.000|TR0|coming back to take it again and was 
20110110011813.000|20110110011816.000|TR0|really concerned and complaining about 
20110110011816.000|20110110011818.000|TR0|that.
20110110011818.000|20110110011821.000|TR0|
20110110011821.000|20110110011823.000|TR0|YELLIN:  He was clearly a very, very 
20110110011823.000|20110110011826.000|TR0|disturbed person, and there were signs.
20110110011826.000|20110110011828.000|TR0|
20110110011828.000|20110110011830.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Yes.
20110110011830.000|20110110011833.000|TR0|
20110110011833.000|20110110011835.000|TR0|YELLIN:  There were signs early.  All 
20110110011835.000|20110110011838.000|TR0|right.  Thank you, Drew.
20110110011838.000|20110110011840.000|TR0|
20110110011840.000|20110110011843.000|TR0|All right, and we are going to turn now to 
20110110011843.000|20110110011845.000|TR0|a happier story, a story of an intern who 
20110110011845.000|20110110011848.000|TR0|was able to tend to her (SIC) boss, 
20110110011848.000|20110110011850.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords. Our own Ted Rowlands 
20110110011850.000|20110110011852.000|TR0|has that story.
20110110011852.000|20110110011855.000|TR0|
20110110011855.000|20110110011857.000|TR0|Ted, you were able to speak to this 
20110110011857.000|20110110011900.000|TR0|intern, another actual hero on this day, 
20110110011900.000|20110110011902.000|TR0|this terrible, tragic day.
20110110011902.000|20110110011905.000|TR0|
20110110011905.000|20110110011907.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, 
20110110011907.000|20110110011909.000|TR0|absolutely, Jessica.  Daniel Hernandez is 
20110110011909.000|20110110011912.000|TR0|a 20-year-old college student here, and 
20110110011912.000|20110110011914.000|TR0|what an impressive young man he is.  He 
20110110011914.000|20110110011917.000|TR0|was at this event.  He was an intern for 
20110110011917.000|20110110011919.000|TR0|the congresswoman.  And you're going to 
20110110011919.000|20110110011922.000|TR0|hear in his own words exactly what 
20110110011922.000|20110110011924.000|TR0|happened.  But after you hear him, it's 
20110110011924.000|20110110011926.000|TR0|very clear that this young man helped save 
20110110011926.000|20110110011929.000|TR0|the congresswoman's life.
20110110011929.000|20110110011931.000|TR0|
20110110011931.000|20110110011934.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
20110110011934.000|20110110011936.000|TR0|
20110110011936.000|20110110011939.000|TR0|DANIEL HERNANDEZ, GIFFORDS'S INTERN:  I 
20110110011939.000|20110110011941.000|TR0|heard the gunshots, and I knew that people 
20110110011941.000|20110110011943.000|TR0|had been injured, most likely.  So I ran 
20110110011943.000|20110110011946.000|TR0|towards where the congresswoman was.
20110110011946.000|20110110011948.000|TR0|
20110110011948.000|20110110011951.000|TR0|When I got there, I saw that there were 
20110110011951.000|20110110011953.000|TR0|people who had been injured. I then tried 
20110110011953.000|20110110011956.000|TR0|to see who had a pulse still, see if 
20110110011956.000|20110110011958.000|TR0|people were still breathing.  I was only 
20110110011958.000|20110110012000.000|TR0|able to check two or three people before I 
20110110012000.000|20110110012003.000|TR0|noticed that Congresswoman Giffords had 
20110110012003.000|20110110012005.000|TR0|been injured severely.  So then she became 
20110110012005.000|20110110012008.000|TR0|my first priority -- not just because of 
20110110012008.000|20110110012010.000|TR0|her position but also because of the 
20110110012010.000|20110110012013.000|TR0|severity of her wounds.
20110110012013.000|20110110012015.000|TR0|
20110110012015.000|20110110012017.000|TR0|She had a shot to the head, so I tried to 
20110110012017.000|20110110012020.000|TR0|make sure that I picked her up so that she 
20110110012020.000|20110110012022.000|TR0|wasn't in a position where she could 
20110110012022.000|20110110012025.000|TR0|asphyxiate on her own blood because of the 
20110110012025.000|20110110012027.000|TR0|position that she was originally in.  I 
20110110012027.000|20110110012030.000|TR0|then started applying pressure to her 
20110110012030.000|20110110012032.000|TR0|wound to try and kind of stem some of the 
20110110012032.000|20110110012034.000|TR0|blood loss.
20110110012034.000|20110110012037.000|TR0|
20110110012037.000|20110110012039.000|TR0|People from the Safeway came outside with 
20110110012039.000|20110110012042.000|TR0|smocks from the meat department which were 
20110110012042.000|20110110012044.000|TR0|clean, that we were able to then use to 
20110110012044.000|20110110012047.000|TR0|cover her wound.
20110110012047.000|20110110012049.000|TR0|
20110110012049.000|20110110012052.000|TR0|She was alert and conscious, but she 
20110110012052.000|20110110012054.000|TR0|wasn't able to speak.  So the way that she 
20110110012054.000|20110110012056.000|TR0|was communicating was by grabbing my hand 
20110110012056.000|20110110012059.000|TR0|and just squeezing.
20110110012059.000|20110110012101.000|TR0|
20110110012101.000|20110110012104.000|TR0|My main thing was just trying to keep her 
20110110012104.000|20110110012106.000|TR0|as alert as possible and just keep trying 
20110110012106.000|20110110012109.000|TR0|to interact with her so that she was still 
20110110012109.000|20110110012111.000|TR0|acting with some response.
20110110012111.000|20110110012113.000|TR0|
20110110012113.000|20110110012116.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  And she was?
20110110012116.000|20110110012118.000|TR0|
20110110012118.000|20110110012121.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  She was.  The entire time that 
20110110012121.000|20110110012123.000|TR0|I was with the congresswoman, she was 
20110110012123.000|20110110012126.000|TR0|still responding.  She was obviously in a 
20110110012126.000|20110110012128.000|TR0|lot of pain, so I just let her know to 
20110110012128.000|20110110012130.000|TR0|squeeze my hand as hard as she needed to.
20110110012130.000|20110110012133.000|TR0|
20110110012133.000|20110110012135.000|TR0|Once the emergency services came and I no 
20110110012135.000|20110110012138.000|TR0|longer was providing the care, my main 
20110110012138.000|20110110012140.000|TR0|concern was trying to sure that she knew 
20110110012140.000|20110110012143.000|TR0|that someone was there with her, no matter 
20110110012143.000|20110110012145.000|TR0|what happened, that she knew that someone 
20110110012145.000|20110110012147.000|TR0|was there holding her hand.
20110110012147.000|20110110012150.000|TR0|
20110110012150.000|20110110012152.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Did you save her life?
20110110012152.000|20110110012155.000|TR0|
20110110012155.000|20110110012157.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  I don't think that I did.  I 
20110110012157.000|20110110012200.000|TR0|think it was emergency services.  People 
20110110012200.000|20110110012202.000|TR0|have been referring to me as a hero.  I 
20110110012202.000|20110110012204.000|TR0|don't think that that's something that I 
20110110012204.000|20110110012207.000|TR0|am.  I think the people that are heroes 
20110110012207.000|20110110012209.000|TR0|are people like Gabby, who are public 
20110110012209.000|20110110012212.000|TR0|servants and who have dedicated their 
20110110012212.000|20110110012214.000|TR0|lives to public service.  So it just makes 
20110110012214.000|20110110012217.000|TR0|me happy that I was be able to help her in 
20110110012217.000|20110110012219.000|TR0|any way that I could.

20110110012229.000|20110110012231.000|TR0|got his first aid training during a class 
20110110012231.000|20110110012234.000|TR0|in first aid when he was in high school.  
20110110012234.000|20110110012236.000|TR0|And he said it just instantly came back to 
20110110012236.000|20110110012239.000|TR0|him and he jumped into that mode. Clearly, 
20110110012239.000|20110110012241.000|TR0|this young man helped save the 
20110110012241.000|20110110012243.000|TR0|congresswoman's life.  He has heard from 
20110110012243.000|20110110012246.000|TR0|the family, including her husband.  They

20110110012334.000|20110110012337.000|TR0|horrible, horrible incident.  But is it an 
20110110012337.000|20110110012339.000|TR0|isolated incident, or does Congress need

20110110012509.000|20110110012512.000|TR0|about security.  Not a lot of new 
20110110012512.000|20110110012514.000|TR0|instructions, if you will.  The only thing 
20110110012514.000|20110110012517.000|TR0|that I was told that they were told was a 
20110110012517.000|20110110012519.000|TR0|designated district staff member to be in 
20110110012519.000|20110110012521.000|TR0|touch with law enforcement.  They said 
20110110012521.000|20110110012524.000|TR0|they were going to talk more about it 
20110110012524.000|20110110012526.000|TR0|later on.

20110110012529.000|20110110012531.000|TR0|But listen to what the number two Democrat 
20110110012531.000|20110110012534.000|TR0|in the House, Steny Hoyer, said about how 
20110110012534.000|20110110012536.000|TR0|members are feeling.

20110110012543.000|20110110012546.000|TR0|REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD), MINORITY WHIP:  I 
20110110012546.000|20110110012548.000|TR0|don't think there's any doubt but my 
20110110012548.000|20110110012551.000|TR0|colleagues are very concerned about the 
20110110012551.000|20110110012553.000|TR0|environment in which they're now 
20110110012553.000|20110110012555.000|TR0|operating.  It's been a much angrier, 
20110110012555.000|20110110012558.000|TR0|confrontational environment over the last 
20110110012558.000|20110110012600.000|TR0|two or three years than we have 
20110110012600.000|20110110012603.000|TR0|experienced in the past.  And I think 
20110110012603.000|20110110012605.000|TR0|there is worry about that. I will tell you 
20110110012605.000|20110110012608.000|TR0|also that the staffers -- we should not 
20110110012608.000|20110110012610.000|TR0|forget that a staff member was lost here.

20110110012617.000|20110110012620.000|TR0|BASH:  And we should underscore that 
20110110012620.000|20110110012622.000|TR0|members of Congress, all of them that I 
20110110012622.000|20110110012625.000|TR0|talked to, they say that they understand 
20110110012625.000|20110110012627.000|TR0|that at least now that this looks like an 
20110110012627.000|20110110012630.000|TR0|isolated incident.  But many of them say, 
20110110012630.000|20110110012632.000|TR0|Look, this is our job.  This is what we 
20110110012632.000|20110110012634.000|TR0|do.  We're not going to change. We're not 
20110110012634.000|20110110012637.000|TR0|going to not go and talk to our 
20110110012637.000|20110110012639.000|TR0|constituents.  One member I talked to said 
20110110012639.000|20110110012642.000|TR0|maybe he already had stopped putting his 
20110110012642.000|20110110012644.000|TR0|schedule on his Web site because he was a 
20110110012644.000|20110110012647.000|TR0|little bit fearful.  He said maybe other 
20110110012647.000|20110110012649.000|TR0|members are going to do that.  But look, 
20110110012649.000|20110110012651.000|TR0|the bottom line is that you can't protect 
20110110012651.000|20110110012654.000|TR0|435 members of the House, 100 members of 
20110110012654.000|20110110012656.000|TR0|Senate every day, like you have -- like we 
20110110012656.000|20110110012659.000|TR0|see every day for somebody like the

20110110012704.000|20110110012706.000|TR0|KING:  Well, stay with us.  Let's continue 
20110110012706.000|20110110012708.000|TR0|the conversation and bring in Congressman 
20110110012708.000|20110110012711.000|TR0|Jason Chaffetz.  He's a Republican.  He 
20110110012711.000|20110110012713.000|TR0|joins us from Salt Lake City.

20110110012716.000|20110110012718.000|TR0|Congressman, let me ask you straight up 
20110110012718.000|20110110012721.000|TR0|this.  Are you fearful now. When you're 
20110110012721.000|20110110012723.000|TR0|home in your district and you want to 
20110110012723.000|20110110012725.000|TR0|interact with your constituents, the best 
20110110012725.000|20110110012728.000|TR0|way is to find a public place, like 
20110110012728.000|20110110012730.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords did, a supermarket, 
20110110012730.000|20110110012733.000|TR0|a mall, some place open like that.  Are 
20110110012733.000|20110110012735.000|TR0|you fearful that that's a mistake?
20110110012735.000|20110110012738.000|TR0|
20110110012738.000|20110110012740.000|TR0|REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH:  Well, no, 
20110110012740.000|20110110012742.000|TR0|I don't think it's a mistake.  I think 
20110110012742.000|20110110012745.000|TR0|it's a necessity.  But it does strike a 
20110110012745.000|20110110012747.000|TR0|chord.  It does send a shiver down your 
20110110012747.000|20110110012750.000|TR0|spine, and we relate to it.  We're touched 
20110110012750.000|20110110012752.000|TR0|by it.  It is a little -- little 
20110110012752.000|20110110012755.000|TR0|frightening that there's some whacko out 
20110110012755.000|20110110012757.000|TR0|there that'll do some unthinkable thing, 
20110110012757.000|20110110012759.000|TR0|as we saw with our friend in Gabby.  So -- 
20110110012759.000|20110110012802.000|TR0|but we've got to keep doing it.  We got to 
20110110012802.000|20110110012804.000|TR0|keep being out there.
20110110012804.000|20110110012807.000|TR0|
20110110012807.000|20110110012809.000|TR0|KING:  You heard your Democratic 
20110110012809.000|20110110012812.000|TR0|colleague, Mr. Hoyer, say that he thinks 
20110110012812.000|20110110012814.000|TR0|the last few years, the environment is 
20110110012814.000|20110110012817.000|TR0|worse, that it is more threatening, that 
20110110012817.000|20110110012819.000|TR0|there is sharper language, more 
20110110012819.000|20110110012821.000|TR0|threatening language.  Have you received 
20110110012821.000|20110110012824.000|TR0|specific threats against you?
20110110012824.000|20110110012826.000|TR0|
20110110012826.000|20110110012829.000|TR0|CHAFFETZ:  Well, I just completed my first 
20110110012829.000|20110110012831.000|TR0|term in Congress.  I've only been there 24 
20110110012831.000|20110110012834.000|TR0|months.  But unfortunately, I've had my 
20110110012834.000|20110110012836.000|TR0|share of threats.  And I've had to engage 
20110110012836.000|20110110012838.000|TR0|sergeant-at-arms and the Capitol Hill 
20110110012838.000|20110110012841.000|TR0|police, and I think they've done a good 
20110110012841.000|20110110012843.000|TR0|job.  I think every single member of 
20110110012843.000|20110110012846.000|TR0|Congress on both sides of the aisle has 
20110110012846.000|20110110012848.000|TR0|felt the heat, has really felt people have 
20110110012848.000|20110110012851.000|TR0|stepped over the line and been a threat.  
20110110012851.000|20110110012853.000|TR0|And it's just part of the reality of being 
20110110012853.000|20110110012855.000|TR0|in Congress. KING:  You have a permit to 
20110110012855.000|20110110012858.000|TR0|carry a weapon, a concealed weapon.  You 
20110110012858.000|20110110012900.000|TR0|have that permit.  It's perfectly legal.  
20110110012900.000|20110110012903.000|TR0|And you were quoted in a news article 
20110110012903.000|20110110012905.000|TR0|today as saying perhaps -- perhaps you'll 
20110110012905.000|20110110012908.000|TR0|take advantage of that right to protect 
20110110012908.000|20110110012910.000|TR0|yourself more often.  Is that true?
20110110012910.000|20110110012912.000|TR0|
20110110012912.000|20110110012915.000|TR0|CHAFFETZ:  I do not carry a weapon when I 
20110110012915.000|20110110012917.000|TR0|go to Washington, D.C.  We have great 
20110110012917.000|20110110012920.000|TR0|security there.  When I'm home here in 
20110110012920.000|20110110012922.000|TR0|Utah -- I was a concealed carry permit 
20110110012922.000|20110110012925.000|TR0|holder before I was in Congress.  I've 
20110110012925.000|20110110012927.000|TR0|continued with that practice, and I will 
20110110012927.000|20110110012929.000|TR0|probably make it even more regular in my 
20110110012929.000|20110110012932.000|TR0|routine moving forward.  It's just a 
20110110012932.000|20110110012934.000|TR0|personal security thing for me.  I think 
20110110012934.000|20110110012937.000|TR0|it's a smart thing.  Not everybody could 
20110110012937.000|20110110012939.000|TR0|or necessarily should do this, but I've 
20110110012939.000|20110110012942.000|TR0|always felt comfortable with it and did it 
20110110012942.000|20110110012944.000|TR0|before I was in Congress and will continue 
20110110012944.000|20110110012946.000|TR0|moving forward.
20110110012946.000|20110110012949.000|TR0|
20110110012949.000|20110110012951.000|TR0|BASH:  Congressman, it's Dana Bash.  You 
20110110012951.000|20110110012954.000|TR0|and I spoke earlier by phone, and you were 
20110110012954.000|20110110012956.000|TR0|talking to me about the fact that you feel 
20110110012956.000|20110110012959.000|TR0|safe in Washington and the Capitol, but 
20110110012959.000|20110110013001.000|TR0|not so much at home in the district or 
20110110013001.000|20110110013004.000|TR0|your residence.  Talk a little bit about 
20110110013004.000|20110110013006.000|TR0|that and about some of your ideas for how 
20110110013006.000|20110110013008.000|TR0|you and your fellow members of Congress 
20110110013008.000|20110110013011.000|TR0|could get better security when you're back 
20110110013011.000|20110110013013.000|TR0|home.
20110110013013.000|20110110013016.000|TR0|
20110110013016.000|20110110013018.000|TR0|CHAFFETZ:  Undoubtedly, the security in 
20110110013018.000|20110110013021.000|TR0|Washington, D.C., the number one terrorist 
20110110013021.000|20110110013023.000|TR0|target in the world, is very, very secure. 
20110110013023.000|20110110013025.000|TR0| My personal residence, my two district 
20110110013025.000|20110110013028.000|TR0|offices, I have some question marks about. 
20110110013028.000|20110110013030.000|TR0|And I think we need to explore the idea of 
20110110013030.000|20110110013033.000|TR0|allowing the sergeant-of- arms to really 
20110110013033.000|20110110013035.000|TR0|coordinate, I think, with the U.S. 
20110110013035.000|20110110013038.000|TR0|Marshals, who are already tasked with 
20110110013038.000|20110110013040.000|TR0|protecting federal judges, U.S. 
20110110013040.000|20110110013042.000|TR0|prosecutors. These people are protected, 
20110110013042.000|20110110013045.000|TR0|and there's threat assessment done by the 
20110110013045.000|20110110013047.000|TR0|U.S. Marshals.  Perhaps that role and 
20110110013047.000|20110110013050.000|TR0|responsibility ought to be expanded out to 
20110110013050.000|20110110013052.000|TR0|include members of Congress to make those 
20110110013052.000|20110110013055.000|TR0|types of assessments.
20110110013055.000|20110110013057.000|TR0|
20110110013057.000|20110110013059.000|TR0|I also think we need to look very closely 
20110110013059.000|20110110013102.000|TR0|at the Internet because we get a lot of 
20110110013102.000|20110110013104.000|TR0|threats via, you know, Facebook and 
20110110013104.000|20110110013107.000|TR0|Twitter, e-mails that are just 
20110110013107.000|20110110013109.000|TR0|unacceptable.  And I think we're going to 
20110110013109.000|20110110013112.000|TR0|have to take those much more seriously 
20110110013112.000|20110110013114.000|TR0|than we have in the past.

20110110013116.000|20110110013119.000|TR0|KING:  Well, Congressman, as you take 
20110110013119.000|20110110013121.000|TR0|those threats much more seriously than in 
20110110013121.000|20110110013124.000|TR0|the past, there are some, as you know -- 
20110110013124.000|20110110013126.000|TR0|you're well aware, in the last 24 hours -- 
20110110013126.000|20110110013129.000|TR0|who have said that that commentary, the 
20110110013129.000|20110110013131.000|TR0|threatening language, the tough language 
20110110013131.000|20110110013133.000|TR0|in the social network, is encouraged by 
20110110013133.000|20110110013136.000|TR0|politicians who have used increasingly 
20110110013136.000|20110110013138.000|TR0|sharp language, military terms.  Do you 
20110110013138.000|20110110013141.000|TR0|believe that a coarsening of the political 
20110110013141.000|20110110013143.000|TR0|discourse is contributing to this 
20110110013143.000|20110110013146.000|TR0|environment?

20110110013148.000|20110110013151.000|TR0|CHAFFETZ:  Look, what makes America the 
20110110013151.000|20110110013153.000|TR0|greatest country on the face of the planet 
20110110013153.000|20110110013155.000|TR0|is that we can disagree on issues, that we 
20110110013155.000|20110110013158.000|TR0|stand up for truth (ph), for principle and 
20110110013158.000|20110110013200.000|TR0|we debate those issues.  But at the end of 
20110110013200.000|20110110013203.000|TR0|the day, we're still all on the same team. 
20110110013203.000|20110110013205.000|TR0| We're still all Americans, and we ought 
20110110013205.000|20110110013208.000|TR0|to be able to shake -- you know, put our 
20110110013208.000|20110110013210.000|TR0|hands out there and shake hands.  And 
20110110013210.000|20110110013212.000|TR0|nobody has ever advocated to move to 
20110110013212.000|20110110013215.000|TR0|violence, to step over that line and do 
20110110013215.000|20110110013217.000|TR0|the unthinkable that we just saw play out 
20110110013217.000|20110110013220.000|TR0|in Tucson.
20110110013220.000|20110110013222.000|TR0|
20110110013222.000|20110110013225.000|TR0|So it happens on both sides.  I do worry 
20110110013225.000|20110110013227.000|TR0|about it.  Here in Utah, one of the local 
20110110013227.000|20110110013229.000|TR0|television stations, local newspapers, got 
20110110013229.000|20110110013232.000|TR0|rid of the comment boards because they got 
20110110013232.000|20110110013234.000|TR0|so out of control.  People were being so 
20110110013234.000|20110110013237.000|TR0|aggressive, really stepping over the line. 
20110110013237.000|20110110013239.000|TR0| And I think that is a legitimate thing we 
20110110013239.000|20110110013242.000|TR0|should look at moving forward.
20110110013242.000|20110110013244.000|TR0|
20110110013244.000|20110110013246.000|TR0|KING:  Congressman Chaffetz, appreciate

20110110013259.000|20110110013301.000|TR0|could be so hopeful tonight that 
20110110013301.000|20110110013303.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabby Giffords could survive 
20110110013303.000|20110110013306.000|TR0|despite being shot point-blank in the

20110110013330.000|20110110013333.000|TR0|pistol.  He went in, he just started 
20110110013333.000|20110110013335.000|TR0|firing and then he ran.

20110110013342.000|20110110013345.000|TR0|KING:  The 911 call there.  The shooting 
20110110013345.000|20110110013347.000|TR0|happened about 10:10 Saturday morning 
20110110013347.000|20110110013350.000|TR0|Tucson time during an outdoor town meeting 
20110110013350.000|20110110013352.000|TR0|event called "Congress on Your Corner."  
20110110013352.000|20110110013355.000|TR0|There was a big banner with Representative 
20110110013355.000|20110110013357.000|TR0|Giffords's name on it.  She was there to 
20110110013357.000|20110110013359.000|TR0|answer questions and talk with anyone, 
20110110013359.000|20110110013402.000|TR0|anyone who showed up.  Nobody expected 
20110110013402.000|20110110013404.000|TR0|this.

20110110013409.000|20110110013412.000|TR0|
20110110013412.000|20110110013414.000|TR0|DANIEL HERNANDEZ, GIFFORDS'S INTERN:  I 
20110110013414.000|20110110013416.000|TR0|heard the gunshots, and I knew that people 
20110110013416.000|20110110013419.000|TR0|had been injured, most likely.  So I ran 
20110110013419.000|20110110013421.000|TR0|towards where the congresswoman was.
20110110013421.000|20110110013424.000|TR0|
20110110013424.000|20110110013426.000|TR0|When I got there, I saw that there were 
20110110013426.000|20110110013429.000|TR0|people who had been injured. I then tried 
20110110013429.000|20110110013431.000|TR0|to see who had a pulse still; see if 
20110110013431.000|20110110013433.000|TR0|people were still breathing.  I was only 
20110110013433.000|20110110013436.000|TR0|able to check two or three people before I 
20110110013436.000|20110110013438.000|TR0|noticed that Congresswoman Giffords had 
20110110013438.000|20110110013441.000|TR0|been injured severely.  So then she became 
20110110013441.000|20110110013443.000|TR0|my first priority -- not just because of 
20110110013443.000|20110110013446.000|TR0|her position but also because of the 
20110110013446.000|20110110013448.000|TR0|severity of her wounds.
20110110013448.000|20110110013450.000|TR0|
20110110013450.000|20110110013453.000|TR0|She had a shot to the head, so I tried to 
20110110013453.000|20110110013455.000|TR0|make sure that I picked her up so that she 
20110110013455.000|20110110013458.000|TR0|wasn't in a position where she could 
20110110013458.000|20110110013500.000|TR0|asphyxiate on her own blood because of the 
20110110013500.000|20110110013503.000|TR0|position that she was originally in.  I 
20110110013503.000|20110110013505.000|TR0|then started applying pressure to her 
20110110013505.000|20110110013507.000|TR0|wound to try and kind of stem some of the 
20110110013507.000|20110110013510.000|TR0|blood loss.
20110110013510.000|20110110013512.000|TR0|
20110110013512.000|20110110013515.000|TR0|People from the Safeway came outside with 
20110110013515.000|20110110013517.000|TR0|smocks from the meat department which were 
20110110013517.000|20110110013520.000|TR0|clean, that we were able to then use to 
20110110013520.000|20110110013522.000|TR0|cover her wound.
20110110013522.000|20110110013524.000|TR0|
20110110013524.000|20110110013527.000|TR0|She was alert and conscious, but she 
20110110013527.000|20110110013529.000|TR0|wasn't able to speak.  So the way that she 
20110110013529.000|20110110013532.000|TR0|was communicating was by grabbing my hand 
20110110013532.000|20110110013534.000|TR0|and just squeezing.
20110110013534.000|20110110013537.000|TR0|
20110110013537.000|20110110013539.000|TR0|My main thing was just trying to keep her 
20110110013539.000|20110110013542.000|TR0|as alert as possible and just keep trying 
20110110013542.000|20110110013544.000|TR0|to interact with her so that she was still 
20110110013544.000|20110110013546.000|TR0|acting with some response.
20110110013546.000|20110110013549.000|TR0|
20110110013549.000|20110110013551.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  And she 
20110110013551.000|20110110013554.000|TR0|was?
20110110013554.000|20110110013556.000|TR0|
20110110013556.000|20110110013559.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  She was.  The entire time that 
20110110013559.000|20110110013601.000|TR0|I was with the congresswoman, she was 
20110110013601.000|20110110013603.000|TR0|still responding.  She was obviously in a 
20110110013603.000|20110110013606.000|TR0|lot of pain, so I just let her know to 
20110110013606.000|20110110013608.000|TR0|squeeze my hand as hard as she needed to.
20110110013608.000|20110110013611.000|TR0|
20110110013611.000|20110110013613.000|TR0|Once the emergency services came and I no 
20110110013613.000|20110110013616.000|TR0|longer was providing the care, my main 
20110110013616.000|20110110013618.000|TR0|concern was trying to sure that she knew 
20110110013618.000|20110110013620.000|TR0|that someone was there with her, no matter 
20110110013620.000|20110110013623.000|TR0|what happened, that she knew that someone 
20110110013623.000|20110110013625.000|TR0|was there holding her hand.
20110110013625.000|20110110013628.000|TR0|
20110110013628.000|20110110013630.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Did you save her life?
20110110013630.000|20110110013633.000|TR0|
20110110013633.000|20110110013635.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  I don't think that I did.  I 
20110110013635.000|20110110013637.000|TR0|think it was emergency services.  People 
20110110013637.000|20110110013640.000|TR0|have been referring to me as a hero.  I 
20110110013640.000|20110110013642.000|TR0|don't think that that's something that I 
20110110013642.000|20110110013645.000|TR0|am.  I think the people that are heroes 
20110110013645.000|20110110013647.000|TR0|are people like Gabby, who are public 
20110110013647.000|20110110013650.000|TR0|servants and who have dedicated their 
20110110013650.000|20110110013652.000|TR0|lives to public service.  So it just makes 
20110110013652.000|20110110013654.000|TR0|me happy that I was be able to help her in 
20110110013654.000|20110110013657.000|TR0|any way that I could.

20110110013738.000|20110110013741.000|TR0|over and over again by the doctors who are 
20110110013741.000|20110110013743.000|TR0|taking care of her.  In fact, they talked 
20110110013743.000|20110110013746.000|TR0|about yesterday, John, really pretty soon 
20110110013746.000|20110110013748.000|TR0|after the operation, about how they were 
20110110013748.000|20110110013750.000|TR0|as optimistic as they could be, which I 
20110110013750.000|20110110013753.000|TR0|was actually a little bit surprised by, 
20110110013753.000|20110110013755.000|TR0|John, that soon after an operation, 
20110110013755.000|20110110013758.000|TR0|doctors saying that.  Usually, surgeons 
20110110013758.000|20110110013800.000|TR0|hold their cards a little closer to the 
20110110013800.000|20110110013803.000|TR0|vest.
20110110013803.000|20110110013805.000|TR0|
20110110013805.000|20110110013807.000|TR0|But they had a lot of good reason to be, 
20110110013807.000|20110110013810.000|TR0|it sounds like, as we've collected more 
20110110013810.000|20110110013812.000|TR0|information.  First of all, she was able 
20110110013812.000|20110110013815.000|TR0|to get to the operating room quickly after 
20110110013815.000|20110110013817.000|TR0|this, and that's obviously something that 
20110110013817.000|20110110013820.000|TR0|helped her.  But also, when she got to the 
20110110013820.000|20110110013822.000|TR0|hospital originally, John, one of the 
20110110013822.000|20110110013824.000|TR0|things doctors do immediately is see now 
20110110013824.000|20110110013827.000|TR0|-- what is her neurological status.  And 
20110110013827.000|20110110013829.000|TR0|is she able to demonstrate some evidence 
20110110013829.000|20110110013832.000|TR0|of high brain function?
20110110013832.000|20110110013834.000|TR0|
20110110013834.000|20110110013837.000|TR0|You know, Dr. Friese is one of the doctors 
20110110013837.000|20110110013839.000|TR0|who saw her immediately.  I had a chance 
20110110013839.000|20110110013841.000|TR0|to talk to him earlier and asked what he 
20110110013841.000|20110110013844.000|TR0|-- what that exam was like when he first 
20110110013844.000|20110110013846.000|TR0|saw the congresswoman.  Here's what he 
20110110013846.000|20110110013849.000|TR0|said.

20110110013856.000|20110110013858.000|TR0|DR. RANDALL FRIESE, TRAUMA SURGEON:  One 
20110110013858.000|20110110013901.000|TR0|of the first things I wanted to do was 
20110110013901.000|20110110013903.000|TR0|assess her ability to understand what was 
20110110013903.000|20110110013906.000|TR0|going on, and I also wanted to reassure 
20110110013906.000|20110110013908.000|TR0|her.  So one of the first things I did was 
20110110013908.000|20110110013911.000|TR0|I held her hand and I leaned in close to 
20110110013911.000|20110110013913.000|TR0|her and told her that she was at the 
20110110013913.000|20110110013916.000|TR0|hospital, that we were going to care for 
20110110013916.000|20110110013918.000|TR0|her.  And I wanted to see if she 
20110110013918.000|20110110013920.000|TR0|understood what was happening, and I asked 
20110110013920.000|20110110013923.000|TR0|her to please squeeze my hand.  She gave 
20110110013923.000|20110110013925.000|TR0|me a great, big squeeze at that point, and 
20110110013925.000|20110110013928.000|TR0|I was very encouraged, as a good finding, 
20110110013928.000|20110110013930.000|TR0|that she understood what I was asking.

20110110013940.000|20110110013942.000|TR0|still able -- they say she's still able to 
20110110013942.000|20110110013945.000|TR0|follow commands, hear something, process 
20110110013945.000|20110110013947.000|TR0|it, and execute a function based on what 
20110110013947.000|20110110013950.000|TR0|she's hearing.  They have her in what 
20110110013950.000|20110110013952.000|TR0|they're calling a medically-induced coma, 
20110110013952.000|20110110013954.000|TR0|giving her lots of medications to sort of 
20110110013954.000|20110110013957.000|TR0|keep her brain at rest, obviously try and 
20110110013957.000|20110110013959.000|TR0|sedate her and diminish her pain.  But 
20110110013959.000|20110110014002.000|TR0|John, they wake her up periodically, 
20110110014002.000|20110110014004.000|TR0|almost every hour usually, and make sure 
20110110014004.000|20110110014007.000|TR0|that that neurological exam that we just 
20110110014007.000|20110110014009.000|TR0|described hasn't changed, John.

20110110014011.000|20110110014014.000|TR0|KING:  And Sanjay, a lot of what we're 
20110110014014.000|20110110014016.000|TR0|getting from viewers and seeing in the 
20110110014016.000|20110110014019.000|TR0|social networks is people just saying, 
20110110014019.000|20110110014021.000|TR0|Wow, how could she possibly have survived 
20110110014021.000|20110110014024.000|TR0|a shot to the head from such close range?  
20110110014024.000|20110110014026.000|TR0|How rare is that?
20110110014026.000|20110110014028.000|TR0|
20110110014028.000|20110110014031.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, it is rare.  I mean, you 
20110110014031.000|20110110014033.000|TR0|know, it happens, and there are certainly 
20110110014033.000|20110110014036.000|TR0|variables that can determine that, the 
20110110014036.000|20110110014038.000|TR0|type of munition that is used, exactly the 
20110110014038.000|20110110014041.000|TR0|type of trajectory in the brain.
20110110014041.000|20110110014043.000|TR0|
20110110014043.000|20110110014045.000|TR0|What we know, John -- let me just show you 
20110110014045.000|20110110014048.000|TR0|if I can here quickly, looking at this 
20110110014048.000|20110110014050.000|TR0|brain model.  What we know is that the 
20110110014050.000|20110110014053.000|TR0|bullet entered the back of the left side 
20110110014053.000|20110110014055.000|TR0|of the head and exited the front left side 
20110110014055.000|20110110014058.000|TR0|of the head.  It did not cross from one 
20110110014058.000|20110110014100.000|TR0|side of the brain to the other.  If it 
20110110014100.000|20110110014102.000|TR0|had, that would be a very poor sign, and 
20110110014102.000|20110110014105.000|TR0|patients are much less likely to survive 
20110110014105.000|20110110014107.000|TR0|that.
20110110014107.000|20110110014110.000|TR0|
20110110014110.000|20110110014112.000|TR0|It also, John, as you know, I'm sure you 
20110110014112.000|20110110014115.000|TR0|heard, was what's known as a "through and 
20110110014115.000|20110110014117.000|TR0|through" injury.  So the bullet enters and 
20110110014117.000|20110110014120.000|TR0|then it leaves, but a lot of the velocity, 
20110110014120.000|20110110014122.000|TR0|the energy of the bullet actually is 
20110110014122.000|20110110014124.000|TR0|dissipated in the air, as opposed to all 
20110110014124.000|20110110014127.000|TR0|of it being dissipated within the skull 
20110110014127.000|20110110014129.000|TR0|cavity.  And that was really important.
20110110014129.000|20110110014132.000|TR0|
20110110014132.000|20110110014134.000|TR0|Also, the type of operation that's 
20110110014134.000|20110110014137.000|TR0|performed on her, as well, involves lots 
20110110014137.000|20110110014139.000|TR0|of things, including stopping the bleeding 
20110110014139.000|20110110014141.000|TR0|that, you know, is a big concern here, and 
20110110014141.000|20110110014144.000|TR0|also anticipating swelling of the brain 
20110110014144.000|20110110014146.000|TR0|and trying to diminish the impact of that. 
20110110014146.000|20110110014149.000|TR0| Here's how the surgeon put it to us 
20110110014149.000|20110110014151.000|TR0|earlier.

20110110014201.000|20110110014203.000|TR0|UNIV. OF ARIZONA:  Once in the OR, we went 
20110110014203.000|20110110014206.000|TR0|through our routine procedure for this 
20110110014206.000|20110110014208.000|TR0|kind of injury. And that consisted of 
20110110014208.000|20110110014211.000|TR0|controlling the bleeding, which thank 
20110110014211.000|20110110014213.000|TR0|goodness, was not severe or excessive.  
20110110014213.000|20110110014215.000|TR0|Our next objective was to take the 
20110110014215.000|20110110014218.000|TR0|pressure off the brain.  And that was by 
20110110014218.000|20110110014220.000|TR0|removing the bone fragments that were 
20110110014220.000|20110110014223.000|TR0|caused by the bullet fracture, as well as 
20110110014223.000|20110110014225.000|TR0|some additional bone to allow the brain to 
20110110014225.000|20110110014228.000|TR0|relax.  And lastly, we removed any small 
20110110014228.000|20110110014230.000|TR0|parts of devitalized brain, and I'm happy 
20110110014230.000|20110110014232.000|TR0|to say we didn't have to do a whole lot of 
20110110014232.000|20110110014235.000|TR0|that.

20110110014242.000|20110110014245.000|TR0|GUPTA:  So just again, quickly, John, what 
20110110014245.000|20110110014247.000|TR0|he was describing there is the bullet 
20110110014247.000|20110110014249.000|TR0|enters back here in the skull.  Some of 
20110110014249.000|20110110014252.000|TR0|the bone fragments almost act as little 
20110110014252.000|20110110014254.000|TR0|missiles themselves, pushing into the 
20110110014254.000|20110110014257.000|TR0|brain. They have to go and remove some of 
20110110014257.000|20110110014259.000|TR0|that bone, stop that bleeding, clean up 
20110110014259.000|20110110014302.000|TR0|some of the tissue that is actually 
20110110014302.000|20110110014304.000|TR0|damaged by the brain.
20110110014304.000|20110110014307.000|TR0|
20110110014307.000|20110110014309.000|TR0|But it was that last part he was talking 
20110110014309.000|20110110014311.000|TR0|about, John, removing some of the other 
20110110014311.000|20110110014314.000|TR0|bone on the left side of the head here and 
20110110014314.000|20110110014316.000|TR0|removing that so that the brain has a 
20110110014316.000|20110110014319.000|TR0|place to swell.  Because of the hard 
20110110014319.000|20110110014321.000|TR0|casing of the skull, the brain would have 
20110110014321.000|20110110014324.000|TR0|no place to swell, and that can be 
20110110014324.000|20110110014326.000|TR0|catastrophic.  But taking that bone out, 
20110110014326.000|20110110014328.000|TR0|leaving it out for the time being, that's 
20110110014328.000|20110110014331.000|TR0|sort of anticipating the problems with 
20110110014331.000|20110110014333.000|TR0|swelling.

20110110014341.000|20110110014343.000|TR0|successful recovery here -- where there 
20110110014343.000|20110110014345.000|TR0|will necessarily have to be one additional 
20110110014345.000|20110110014348.000|TR0|surgery, two additional surgeries, 
20110110014348.000|20110110014350.000|TR0|several? Do we know?

20110110014353.000|20110110014355.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, you know, I mean, as far as 
20110110014355.000|20110110014358.000|TR0|the acute period now, they're really 
20110110014358.000|20110110014400.000|TR0|hoping that there are no more operations 
20110110014400.000|20110110014402.000|TR0|necessary. You know, the things that would 
20110110014402.000|20110110014405.000|TR0|require another operation are to stop -- 
20110110014405.000|20110110014407.000|TR0|you know, if there's some increased 
20110110014407.000|20110110014410.000|TR0|bleeding, for example.  Because that bone 
20110110014410.000|20110110014412.000|TR0|is removed, hopefully, the swelling, which 
20110110014412.000|20110110014415.000|TR0|is almost anticipated after an injury to 
20110110014415.000|20110110014417.000|TR0|the brain like this -- that's going to be 
20110110014417.000|20110110014419.000|TR0|more easily controllable.
20110110014419.000|20110110014422.000|TR0|
20110110014422.000|20110110014424.000|TR0|The operation in the future, which could 
20110110014424.000|20110110014427.000|TR0|be weeks if not a couple of months down 
20110110014427.000|20110110014429.000|TR0|the road, would be to place that bone back 
20110110014429.000|20110110014432.000|TR0|on the left side of her head, you know, 
20110110014432.000|20110110014434.000|TR0|when clearly, there's no evidence of 
20110110014434.000|20110110014436.000|TR0|swelling and she's ready to have that 
20110110014436.000|20110110014439.000|TR0|done.  But hopefully, no more operations 
20110110014439.000|20110110014441.000|TR0|in the acute aftermath.  They always plan 
20110110014441.000|20110110014444.000|TR0|for one, if necessary, but none planned 
20110110014444.000|20110110014446.000|TR0|now.

20110110014511.000|20110110014513.000|TR0|shooting -- this is a question being asked 
20110110014513.000|20110110014515.000|TR0|in Washington and across American politics 
20110110014515.000|20110110014518.000|TR0|-- will this tragedy tone down our 
20110110014518.000|20110110014520.000|TR0|political rhetoric?

20110110014535.000|20110110014537.000|TR0|CANDIDATE:  My background is I'm a 
20110110014537.000|20110110014540.000|TR0|moderate.  You know, I'm a businesswoman.  
20110110014540.000|20110110014542.000|TR0|I've done a variety of work in this 
20110110014542.000|20110110014545.000|TR0|community.  Again, being a third 
20110110014545.000|20110110014547.000|TR0|generation southern Arizonan I think 
20110110014547.000|20110110014549.000|TR0|really makes a difference.  I think people 
20110110014549.000|20110110014552.000|TR0|understand that it's important to have 
20110110014552.000|20110110014554.000|TR0|someone who's truly from here and 
20110110014554.000|20110110014557.000|TR0|represents the interests of the people, 
20110110014557.000|20110110014559.000|TR0|you know, who had to live and work here.  
20110110014559.000|20110110014602.000|TR0|And I would be proud to represent this

20110110014611.000|20110110014614.000|TR0|KING:  That was from an interview I 
20110110014614.000|20110110014616.000|TR0|conducted with then candidate Gabrielle 
20110110014616.000|20110110014619.000|TR0|Giffords in her first race for Congress 
20110110014619.000|20110110014621.000|TR0|back in 2006. Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110110014621.000|20110110014623.000|TR0|"Gabby" Giffords is a relative newcomer to 
20110110014623.000|20110110014626.000|TR0|Washington, but she's been in politics for 
20110110014626.000|20110110014628.000|TR0|quite a while.  Last Wednesday, she was 
20110110014628.000|20110110014631.000|TR0|sworn in to her third term representing 
20110110014631.000|20110110014633.000|TR0|Arizona's 8th congressional district.  
20110110014633.000|20110110014636.000|TR0|It's a border district in the southeastern 
20110110014636.000|20110110014638.000|TR0|corner of the state.  It was a close and a 
20110110014638.000|20110110014640.000|TR0|bruising race.
20110110014640.000|20110110014643.000|TR0|
20110110014643.000|20110110014645.000|TR0|According to her official biography, solar 
20110110014645.000|20110110014648.000|TR0|energy, immigration reform and issues 
20110110014648.000|20110110014650.000|TR0|affecting military families are her top 
20110110014650.000|20110110014653.000|TR0|priorities in Congress.  Prior to coming 
20110110014653.000|20110110014655.000|TR0|to Washington, she served in both houses 
20110110014655.000|20110110014658.000|TR0|of the Arizona state legislature.  She 
20110110014658.000|20110110014700.000|TR0|also ran her family's tire and automotive 
20110110014700.000|20110110014702.000|TR0|business.  She's a native of Tucson, and 
20110110014702.000|20110110014705.000|TR0|Giffords is married to NASA astronaut Mark 
20110110014705.000|20110110014707.000|TR0|Kelly.

20110110014710.000|20110110014712.000|TR0|Ever since this tragic shooting unfolded, 
20110110014712.000|20110110014715.000|TR0|the Pima County sheriff, Clarence Dupnik, 
20110110014715.000|20110110014717.000|TR0|has railed against what he calls excessive 
20110110014717.000|20110110014719.000|TR0|vitriol. Now, we have to be very, very 
20110110014719.000|20110110014722.000|TR0|clear here.  We do not know a motive yet 
20110110014722.000|20110110014724.000|TR0|in this tragedy, nor do we have any 
20110110014724.000|20110110014727.000|TR0|official clinical assessment of the 
20110110014727.000|20110110014729.000|TR0|gunman's mental state.  But the sheriff 
20110110014729.000|20110110014732.000|TR0|clearly suggests that he sees that an 
20110110014732.000|20110110014734.000|TR0|unstable person could be provoked to 
20110110014734.000|20110110014736.000|TR0|violence by hateful rhetoric on the 
20110110014736.000|20110110014739.000|TR0|airwaves and the Internet.

20110110014741.000|20110110014744.000|TR0|So let's have a conversation about, is our 
20110110014744.000|20110110014746.000|TR0|political rhetoric contributing perhaps, 
20110110014746.000|20110110014749.000|TR0|or at least should we, after an episode 
20110110014749.000|20110110014751.000|TR0|like this, dial it back?  Let's bring in 
20110110014751.000|20110110014753.000|TR0|our senior political analyst David Gergen, 
20110110014753.000|20110110014756.000|TR0|and Jessica Yellin is back with us from 
20110110014756.000|20110110014758.000|TR0|Tucson.
20110110014758.000|20110110014801.000|TR0|
20110110014801.000|20110110014803.000|TR0|David, I want to go to you first because 
20110110014803.000|20110110014806.000|TR0|you have served four presidents.  You have 
20110110014806.000|20110110014808.000|TR0|been around a long time.  You were in the 
20110110014808.000|20110110014810.000|TR0|White House the day Ronald Reagan and Jim 
20110110014810.000|20110110014813.000|TR0|Brady were shot.  And there's a 
20110110014813.000|20110110014815.000|TR0|conversation happening in the wake of this 
20110110014815.000|20110110014818.000|TR0|shooting.  Some of it is thoughtful.  Some 
20110110014818.000|20110110014820.000|TR0|of it is necessary, about security 
20110110014820.000|20110110014823.000|TR0|preparations. Some of it I find, frankly, 
20110110014823.000|20110110014825.000|TR0|a little dangerous and risky, about trying 
20110110014825.000|20110110014827.000|TR0|to assign blame.
20110110014827.000|20110110014830.000|TR0|
20110110014830.000|20110110014832.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110110014832.000|20110110014835.000|TR0|ANALYST:  John, it's that last point that 
20110110014835.000|20110110014837.000|TR0|I think is -- we should focus on for a 
20110110014837.000|20110110014840.000|TR0|moment here, and that is the way that 
20110110014840.000|20110110014842.000|TR0|accusations are being hurled by one side 
20110110014842.000|20110110014845.000|TR0|against the other, charges and 
20110110014845.000|20110110014847.000|TR0|countercharges.  In the absence of 
20110110014847.000|20110110014849.000|TR0|definitive evidence about what the motives 
20110110014849.000|20110110014852.000|TR0|were here for this shooter, I think do run 
20110110014852.000|20110110014854.000|TR0|a heavy risk of only further embittering 
20110110014854.000|20110110014857.000|TR0|us, further poisoning the system and 
20110110014857.000|20110110014859.000|TR0|making it more difficult to go on and to 
20110110014859.000|20110110014902.000|TR0|conduct a civil, decent political 
20110110014902.000|20110110014904.000|TR0|discourse.
20110110014904.000|20110110014906.000|TR0|
20110110014906.000|20110110014909.000|TR0|KING:  And Jess, we do not want to 
20110110014909.000|20110110014911.000|TR0|encourage irresponsible conversation, but 
20110110014911.000|20110110014914.000|TR0|it is also our job to cover politics and 
20110110014914.000|20110110014916.000|TR0|to cover the wake of a tragedy like this.  
20110110014916.000|20110110014919.000|TR0|And you see it in your experience 
20110110014919.000|20110110014921.000|TR0|firsthand there.  There are people saying 
20110110014921.000|20110110014923.000|TR0|this is because of the haters in our 
20110110014923.000|20110110014926.000|TR0|society.  Some have blamed Sarah Palin.  
20110110014926.000|20110110014928.000|TR0|Some have blamed the Tea Party.  And as I 
20110110014928.000|20110110014931.000|TR0|toss to you, I want to be very, very 
20110110014931.000|20110110014933.000|TR0|clear.  As David just said, we know 
20110110014933.000|20110110014936.000|TR0|nothing, nothing about this shooter's -- 
20110110014936.000|20110110014938.000|TR0|alleged shooter's motives.  And we need to 
20110110014938.000|20110110014940.000|TR0|be careful. However, this conversation is 
20110110014940.000|20110110014943.000|TR0|happening, whether we like it or not.
20110110014943.000|20110110014945.000|TR0|
20110110014945.000|20110110014948.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Absolutely.  We've both been 
20110110014948.000|20110110014950.000|TR0|inundated with e-mails, and it's all over 
20110110014950.000|20110110014953.000|TR0|social media.  And you talk to people 
20110110014953.000|20110110014955.000|TR0|here, and they ask about the political 
20110110014955.000|20110110014957.000|TR0|discourse and what it may have done.  It's 
20110110014957.000|20110110015000.000|TR0|really something that does come up when 
20110110015000.000|20110110015002.000|TR0|you approach people.

20110110015005.000|20110110015007.000|TR0|But I have -- I met with one of the Tea 
20110110015007.000|20110110015010.000|TR0|Party activists, the head of the Tea Party 
20110110015010.000|20110110015012.000|TR0|of Tucson, who's feeling very, very 
20110110015012.000|20110110015014.000|TR0|frustrated and upset that the Tea Party 
20110110015014.000|20110110015017.000|TR0|has been invoked in any way because the 
20110110015017.000|20110110015019.000|TR0|shooter -- the alleged shooter has not in 
20110110015019.000|20110110015022.000|TR0|any known way mentioned the Tea Party in 
20110110015022.000|20110110015024.000|TR0|any of his writings or his musings on the 
20110110015024.000|20110110015027.000|TR0|Internet.
20110110015027.000|20110110015029.000|TR0|
20110110015029.000|20110110015032.000|TR0|I just wanted to play a piece of sound 
20110110015032.000|20110110015034.000|TR0|from the Tea Party activist. Maybe David 
20110110015034.000|20110110015036.000|TR0|wants to react, or you, John.

20110110015046.000|20110110015049.000|TR0|ORGANIZER:  I've seen nothing to convince 
20110110015049.000|20110110015051.000|TR0|me that had that been John McCain or Jon 
20110110015051.000|20110110015053.000|TR0|Kyl at that same area that the same thing 
20110110015053.000|20110110015056.000|TR0|wouldn't have happened.
20110110015056.000|20110110015058.000|TR0|
20110110015058.000|20110110015101.000|TR0|YELLIN:  But Gabrielle Giffords was put in 
20110110015101.000|20110110015103.000|TR0|crosshairs by Sarah Palin on her Sarah 
20110110015103.000|20110110015106.000|TR0|PAC, and that's something that a lot of 
20110110015106.000|20110110015108.000|TR0|people on the left have been pointing to.  
20110110015108.000|20110110015110.000|TR0|And also, the sheriff has raised the

20110110015115.000|20110110015118.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  And both of those are absurd!  
20110110015118.000|20110110015120.000|TR0|I'm sorry, but it is -- it's -- it's even 
20110110015120.000|20110110015123.000|TR0|sick, the fact that people were 
20110110015123.000|20110110015125.000|TR0|premeditating making this into a political 
20110110015125.000|20110110015127.000|TR0|issue, when it's a tragedy for our 
20110110015127.000|20110110015130.000|TR0|community, you know?  And it's a horrible 
20110110015130.000|20110110015132.000|TR0|thing, but don't compound it, especially 
20110110015132.000|20110110015135.000|TR0|when you're the sheriff, by going around 
20110110015135.000|20110110015137.000|TR0|and trying to drag people into it that 
20110110015137.000|20110110015140.000|TR0|just don't belong in the discussion at 
20110110015140.000|20110110015142.000|TR0|this point.

20110110015144.000|20110110015147.000|TR0|There's people -- and it's not -- there's 
20110110015147.000|20110110015149.000|TR0|not a lot of people -- I'll go that -- 
20110110015149.000|20110110015152.000|TR0|that were kind of hoping this would be a 
20110110015152.000|20110110015154.000|TR0|Tea Party -- because they don't agree with 
20110110015154.000|20110110015157.000|TR0|the Tea Party, and they want -- they want 
20110110015157.000|20110110015159.000|TR0|a cudgel to go beat the Tea Party with.  
20110110015159.000|20110110015201.000|TR0|They've been waiting for something like 
20110110015201.000|20110110015204.000|TR0|this.  So if it fits or not, they were 
20110110015204.000|20110110015206.000|TR0|going to try to make it fit.  Now, 
20110110015206.000|20110110015209.000|TR0|obviously, the details of the case have 
20110110015209.000|20110110015211.000|TR0|kind of blunted that.

20110110015219.000|20110110015221.000|TR0|KING:  It's an interesting conversation.  
20110110015221.000|20110110015223.000|TR0|And David, a couple things. Number one, I 
20110110015223.000|20110110015226.000|TR0|think that reinforces the idea that it is 
20110110015226.000|20110110015228.000|TR0|reckless to try to assign blame for any 
20110110015228.000|20110110015231.000|TR0|political purpose absent any details. 
20110110015231.000|20110110015233.000|TR0|However, to Jess's questions about the 
20110110015233.000|20110110015236.000|TR0|Palin crosshairs and other things -- could 
20110110015236.000|20110110015238.000|TR0|we use this moment perhaps as a teachable 
20110110015238.000|20110110015240.000|TR0|moment for politicians to be more careful 
20110110015240.000|20110110015243.000|TR0|about what they do, the symbols they use, 
20110110015243.000|20110110015245.000|TR0|the language they use, so that you don't 
20110110015245.000|20110110015248.000|TR0|then, after some tragedy, have them drawn 
20110110015248.000|20110110015250.000|TR0|into a reckless conversation?
20110110015250.000|20110110015253.000|TR0|
20110110015253.000|20110110015255.000|TR0|GERGEN:  John, I think you're on exactly 
20110110015255.000|20110110015257.000|TR0|the right track.  And that is, there are 
20110110015257.000|20110110015300.000|TR0|two parallel points here.  One is we do 
20110110015300.000|20110110015302.000|TR0|not have evidence that there's any link at 
20110110015302.000|20110110015305.000|TR0|all to the rhetoric and what this deranged 
20110110015305.000|20110110015307.000|TR0|young man did.  After all, he may have 
20110110015307.000|20110110015310.000|TR0|been heavily influenced by movies, by 
20110110015310.000|20110110015312.000|TR0|television violence.  And far be it from 
20110110015312.000|20110110015314.000|TR0|us in the media to say, Oh, it's the 
20110110015314.000|20110110015317.000|TR0|politicians who are creating a climate of 
20110110015317.000|20110110015319.000|TR0|violence in this country, when there's so 
20110110015319.000|20110110015322.000|TR0|much violence on television and in the 
20110110015322.000|20110110015324.000|TR0|movies.  So we don't know and we ought to 
20110110015324.000|20110110015327.000|TR0|hold the accusations about this case.
20110110015327.000|20110110015329.000|TR0|
20110110015329.000|20110110015331.000|TR0|At the same time, there is no doubt that 
20110110015331.000|20110110015334.000|TR0|our rhetoric has gotten much, much worse 
20110110015334.000|20110110015336.000|TR0|over the last few years.  It has become 
20110110015336.000|20110110015339.000|TR0|villainous.  It has become poisonous.  And 
20110110015339.000|20110110015341.000|TR0|whether or not this happened, we needed to 
20110110015341.000|20110110015344.000|TR0|get calmed down because it does create an 
20110110015344.000|20110110015346.000|TR0|atmosphere in which people hate each 
20110110015346.000|20110110015348.000|TR0|other.  We don't go forward as a united 
20110110015348.000|20110110015351.000|TR0|people, and it's very hard for anybody to 
20110110015351.000|20110110015353.000|TR0|govern.
20110110015353.000|20110110015356.000|TR0|
20110110015356.000|20110110015358.000|TR0|KING:  And Jess, is it worse there?  We've 
20110110015358.000|20110110015401.000|TR0|both been through Arizona many times in 
20110110015401.000|20110110015403.000|TR0|the last couple years.  It is the 
20110110015403.000|20110110015405.000|TR0|frontier, if you will, in the politics of 
20110110015405.000|20110110015408.000|TR0|division right now, with the big debates 
20110110015408.000|20110110015410.000|TR0|over immigration and all that.  When you 
20110110015410.000|20110110015413.000|TR0|get back on the ground -- I remember being 
20110110015413.000|20110110015415.000|TR0|there in 2006, 2008, again in 2010 -- back 
20110110015415.000|20110110015418.000|TR0|on the ground now, is it exacerbated 
20110110015418.000|20110110015420.000|TR0|there?  Is the volume higher in Arizona?
20110110015420.000|20110110015423.000|TR0|
20110110015423.000|20110110015425.000|TR0|YELLIN:  You know, the difference is we're 
20110110015425.000|20110110015427.000|TR0|in Tucson here.  Pima County is not as 
20110110015427.000|20110110015430.000|TR0|overheated as Maricopa, where all those 
20110110015430.000|20110110015432.000|TR0|immigration debates are really taking 
20110110015432.000|20110110015435.000|TR0|place.  And that's why so many -- so many 
20110110015435.000|20110110015437.000|TR0|of the people I've talked today, John, say 
20110110015437.000|20110110015440.000|TR0|they're surprised this happened here 
20110110015440.000|20110110015442.000|TR0|because they think of this -- one person 
20110110015442.000|20110110015444.000|TR0|described it as the Berkeley of Arizona, a 
20110110015444.000|20110110015447.000|TR0|much more sort of liberal community, in 
20110110015447.000|20110110015449.000|TR0|their mind, or a much more -- I shouldn't 
20110110015449.000|20110110015452.000|TR0|say liberal in this context, but a 
20110110015452.000|20110110015454.000|TR0|different kind of open -- more open 
20110110015454.000|20110110015457.000|TR0|community.  They were really surprised, 
20110110015457.000|20110110015459.000|TR0|John.

20110110015501.000|20110110015504.000|TR0|KING:  And David, in this essay you wrote 
20110110015504.000|20110110015506.000|TR0|on CNN.com today, you say, "We can do 
20110110015506.000|20110110015509.000|TR0|better, a lot better."  Explain.
20110110015509.000|20110110015511.000|TR0|
20110110015511.000|20110110015514.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Well, John, I think we are a 
20110110015514.000|20110110015516.000|TR0|country that was founded in a lot of 
20110110015516.000|20110110015518.000|TR0|tumult.  We've always had a rough and 
20110110015518.000|20110110015521.000|TR0|tumble politics.  But generally speaking, 
20110110015521.000|20110110015523.000|TR0|the leaders of this country since the 
20110110015523.000|20110110015526.000|TR0|founding have been people who've looked 
20110110015526.000|20110110015528.000|TR0|for ways to overcome disagreements, have 
20110110015528.000|20110110015531.000|TR0|looked -- have understood that it's the 
20110110015531.000|20110110015533.000|TR0|unity of the country that drives us 
20110110015533.000|20110110015535.000|TR0|forward.  Our national motto, E pluribus 
20110110015535.000|20110110015538.000|TR0|Unum, is "From many, one."  And we can do 
20110110015538.000|20110110015540.000|TR0|better now in cooling the rhetoric, 
20110110015540.000|20110110015543.000|TR0|cooling the accusations about this 
20110110015543.000|20110110015545.000|TR0|particular case, but at the same time, 
20110110015545.000|20110110015548.000|TR0|renewing our efforts to get the poison and 
20110110015548.000|20110110015550.000|TR0|the vitriol out of our politics and, 
20110110015550.000|20110110015552.000|TR0|indeed, out of the media.

20110110015555.000|20110110015557.000|TR0|KING:  Give a big amen to that.  David 
20110110015557.000|20110110015600.000|TR0|Gergen, Jess, we'll be back to you in just

20110110015602.000|20110110015605.000|TR0|stay with us.  We will reflect on the 
20110110015605.000|20110110015607.000|TR0|youngest victim, the youngest victim, a

20110110015617.000|20110110015619.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Welcome back to our continuing 
20110110015619.000|20110110015622.000|TR0|coverage of "A Congresswoman Shot."  There 
20110110015622.000|20110110015624.000|TR0|are so many questions, but no one must 
20110110015624.000|20110110015627.000|TR0|have more questions than the family of 
20110110015627.000|20110110015629.000|TR0|Christina Green, the 9-year-old who was so 
20110110015629.000|20110110015631.000|TR0|tragically gunned down in this violent 
20110110015631.000|20110110015634.000|TR0|episode. Our own Casey Wian had an 
20110110015634.000|20110110015636.000|TR0|opportunity to talk to her parents.  
20110110015636.000|20110110015639.000|TR0|Casey, it must be difficult to even be 
20110110015639.000|20110110015641.000|TR0|with them.  They must be in shock. But 
20110110015641.000|20110110015644.000|TR0|they were able to share some of their 
20110110015644.000|20110110015646.000|TR0|memories with you.

20110110015648.000|20110110015651.000|TR0|CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They 
20110110015651.000|20110110015653.000|TR0|really were.  It's amazing. Little 
20110110015653.000|20110110015656.000|TR0|Christina Green, 9 years old, was born on 
20110110015656.000|20110110015658.000|TR0|9/11.  And she died nine years later in 
20110110015658.000|20110110015701.000|TR0|this tragedy in Tucson.  And her parents 
20110110015701.000|20110110015703.000|TR0|wanted to make sure that those tragedies 
20110110015703.000|20110110015705.000|TR0|were not what she was remembered for. 
20110110015705.000|20110110015708.000|TR0|Let's listen to what she had to say.

20110110015715.000|20110110015718.000|TR0|JOHN GREEN, 9-YEAR-OLD'S FATHER:  It does 
20110110015718.000|20110110015720.000|TR0|say something about our society that my 
20110110015720.000|20110110015722.000|TR0|daughter was born on a tragic day and she 
20110110015722.000|20110110015725.000|TR0|went out on a tragic day.
20110110015725.000|20110110015727.000|TR0|
20110110015727.000|20110110015730.000|TR0|ROXANNA GREEN, 9-YEAR-OLD'S MOTHER:  She 
20110110015730.000|20110110015732.000|TR0|was a great friend, a great sister, a 
20110110015732.000|20110110015735.000|TR0|great daughter.  I was so proud of her.  
20110110015735.000|20110110015737.000|TR0|And I just want everyone to know -- and I 
20110110015737.000|20110110015739.000|TR0|think a lot of people that know us and 
20110110015739.000|20110110015742.000|TR0|knew Christina Taylor (ph), that you know, 
20110110015742.000|20110110015744.000|TR0|we got robbed, she got robbed of a 
20110110015744.000|20110110015747.000|TR0|beautiful life that she could have had.
20110110015747.000|20110110015749.000|TR0|
20110110015749.000|20110110015752.000|TR0|JOHN GREEN:  There's going to be a lot of 
20110110015752.000|20110110015754.000|TR0|those kind of moments that -- I had one 
20110110015754.000|20110110015757.000|TR0|this morning, just waking up and -- she 
20110110015757.000|20110110015759.000|TR0|comes up and says, Daddy, it's time to get 
20110110015759.000|20110110015801.000|TR0|up.  And she didn't do that this morning.

20110110015809.000|20110110015811.000|TR0|WIAN:  Now, John is obviously a big guy.  
20110110015811.000|20110110015814.000|TR0|He's a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers.  
20110110015814.000|20110110015816.000|TR0|He's an athlete.  His father won a World 
20110110015816.000|20110110015818.000|TR0|Series as manager of the Philadelphia 
20110110015818.000|20110110015821.000|TR0|Phillies.  A very tough individual.  But 
20110110015821.000|20110110015823.000|TR0|it was so difficult to see him reduced to 
20110110015823.000|20110110015826.000|TR0|tears barely 24 hours after his little 
20110110015826.000|20110110015828.000|TR0|girl died, Jessica.
20110110015828.000|20110110015831.000|TR0|
20110110015831.000|20110110015833.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Did he have anything to say about 
20110110015833.000|20110110015835.000|TR0|the shooter?
20110110015835.000|20110110015838.000|TR0|
20110110015838.000|20110110015840.000|TR0|WIAN:  We asked them about that, and both 
20110110015840.000|20110110015843.000|TR0|of them said they haven't really given a 
20110110015843.000|20110110015845.000|TR0|moment's thought to the shooter.  They 
20110110015845.000|20110110015848.000|TR0|don't want to take away from the memory of 
20110110015848.000|20110110015850.000|TR0|their daughter.  But it's very clear 
20110110015850.000|20110110015852.000|TR0|they're very angry, especially the father, 
20110110015852.000|20110110015855.000|TR0|very angry and struggling to understand 
20110110015855.000|20110110015857.000|TR0|why this happened.
20110110015857.000|20110110015900.000|TR0|
20110110015900.000|20110110015902.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Well, I was able to speak to one 
20110110015902.000|20110110015905.000|TR0|of her pastors, the little girl's pastors, 
20110110015905.000|20110110015907.000|TR0|who said it's an unexplainable loss and a 
20110110015907.000|20110110015909.000|TR0|devastating tragedy for this community.

20110110015929.000|20110110015931.000|TR0|contributed to this tragic event here in
