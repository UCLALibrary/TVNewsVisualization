20110129000007.000|20110129000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST:  Thanks Wolf and good 
20110129000009.000|20110129000012.000|TR0|evening everyone.  Tonight Egyptian 
20110129000012.000|20110129000015.000|TR0|President Hosni Mubarak tries to quiet a 
20110129000015.000|20110129000017.000|TR0|political crisis, but his defiant tone 
20110129000017.000|20110129000020.000|TR0|leaves the protesters and the Obama White 
20110129000020.000|20110129000023.000|TR0|House highly disappointed.  President 
20110129000023.000|20110129000025.000|TR0|Obama addressed the Egyptian crisis just 
20110129000025.000|20110129000028.000|TR0|moments ago saying he had called President 
20110129000028.000|20110129000031.000|TR0|Mubarak to deliver a stern message.

20110129000039.000|20110129000042.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENT OF THE 
20110129000042.000|20110129000044.000|TR0|UNITED STATES:  Violence will not address 
20110129000044.000|20110129000047.000|TR0|the grievances of the Egyptian people.  
20110129000047.000|20110129000050.000|TR0|And suppressing ideas never succeeds in 
20110129000050.000|20110129000052.000|TR0|making them go away.  What is needed right 
20110129000052.000|20110129000055.000|TR0|now are concrete steps that advance the 
20110129000055.000|20110129000058.000|TR0|rights of the Egyptian people.  A 
20110129000058.000|20110129000100.000|TR0|meaningful dialogue between the government 
20110129000100.000|20110129000103.000|TR0|and its citizens, and a path of political 
20110129000103.000|20110129000106.000|TR0|change that leads to a future of greater 
20110129000106.000|20110129000108.000|TR0|freedom and greater opportunity and 
20110129000108.000|20110129000111.000|TR0|justice for the Egyptian people.

20110129000119.000|20110129000122.000|TR0|KING:  Just about an hour before President 
20110129000122.000|20110129000125.000|TR0|Obama spoke, the Egyptian president 
20110129000125.000|20110129000127.000|TR0|addressed his people on state television.  
20110129000127.000|20110129000130.000|TR0|That after a day of unprecedented protests 
20110129000130.000|20110129000133.000|TR0|demanding regime change.  A defiant 
20110129000133.000|20110129000135.000|TR0|President Mubarak said he had asked his 
20110129000135.000|20110129000138.000|TR0|government ministers to resign but said he 
20110129000138.000|20110129000141.000|TR0|wasn't going anywhere.

20110129000152.000|20110129000154.000|TR0|translator):  I take responsibility for 
20110129000154.000|20110129000157.000|TR0|the security of this country and the 
20110129000157.000|20110129000200.000|TR0|citizens.  I will not let this happen.  I 
20110129000200.000|20110129000202.000|TR0|will not let fear to live in the citizens. 
20110129000202.000|20110129000205.000|TR0| Or to let this tell us what's going to 
20110129000205.000|20110129000208.000|TR0|happen in the future.

20110129000216.000|20110129000219.000|TR0|KING:  Immediate reaction on the streets 
20110129000219.000|20110129000221.000|TR0|of Egypt suggested President Mubarak had 
20110129000221.000|20110129000224.000|TR0|only strengthened the resolve of his 
20110129000224.000|20110129000227.000|TR0|critics. We have a packed hour ahead 
20110129000227.000|20110129000229.000|TR0|including conversations with the Senate 
20110129000229.000|20110129000232.000|TR0|Foreign Relations Committee John Kerry and 
20110129000232.000|20110129000235.000|TR0|CNN's Fareed Zakaria, but let's begin with 
20110129000235.000|20110129000237.000|TR0|the latest on this dramatic breaking news 
20110129000237.000|20110129000240.000|TR0|from the center of the protests in Cairo.
20110129000240.000|20110129000243.000|TR0|
20110129000243.000|20110129000246.000|TR0|CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is live there.  
20110129000246.000|20110129000248.000|TR0|Fred, I assume after the speech, we have 
20110129000248.000|20110129000251.000|TR0|demonstrations.  It is 2:00 a.m., so help 
20110129000251.000|20110129000254.000|TR0|put us into context, what we're learning 
20110129000254.000|20110129000256.000|TR0|of the initial reaction of the Egyptian 
20110129000256.000|20110129000259.000|TR0|people.
20110129000259.000|20110129000302.000|TR0|
20110129000302.000|20110129000304.000|TR0|FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  
20110129000304.000|20110129000307.000|TR0|Well, John, I mean the protests are still 
20110129000307.000|20110129000310.000|TR0|going on here on the streets of Cairo.  
20110129000310.000|20110129000312.000|TR0|They've gotten a little bit weaker.  As 
20110129000312.000|20110129000315.000|TR0|you said it's about 2:00 in the morning.  
20110129000315.000|20110129000318.000|TR0|But you're absolutely right.  After that 
20110129000318.000|20110129000321.000|TR0|speech by Hosni Mubarak people were very 
20110129000321.000|20110129000323.000|TR0|angry.  They went past our live position 
20110129000323.000|20110129000326.000|TR0|here, actually had the bureau chanting we 
20110129000326.000|20110129000329.000|TR0|want him out.  We want him out.
20110129000329.000|20110129000331.000|TR0|
20110129000331.000|20110129000334.000|TR0|And Gamal, which is Hosni Mubarak's son, 
20110129000334.000|20110129000337.000|TR0|they said, Gamal, tell your father that we 
20110129000337.000|20110129000339.000|TR0|hate him.  So certainly he did seem to 
20110129000339.000|20110129000342.000|TR0|stoke more anger with that speech than 
20110129000342.000|20110129000345.000|TR0|anything else.  And I've been talking to a 
20110129000345.000|20110129000348.000|TR0|lot of people here during these protests 
20110129000348.000|20110129000350.000|TR0|who have been having a lot of issues, who 
20110129000350.000|20110129000353.000|TR0|have been beaten by the police, who have 
20110129000353.000|20110129000356.000|TR0|had tear gas shot at them by the police.
20110129000356.000|20110129000358.000|TR0|
20110129000358.000|20110129000401.000|TR0|And they are telling me that they want 
20110129000401.000|20110129000404.000|TR0|America to take a stronger stand and make 
20110129000404.000|20110129000406.000|TR0|Hosni Mubarak step down.  That's obviously 
20110129000406.000|20110129000409.000|TR0|not something that's going to happen, but 
20110129000409.000|20110129000412.000|TR0|the initial sort of reaction that we got 
20110129000412.000|20110129000414.000|TR0|to the Obama speech is that many people 
20110129000414.000|20110129000417.000|TR0|believe that it was a little bit too weak 
20110129000417.000|20110129000420.000|TR0|for what they were expecting -- John.
20110129000420.000|20110129000423.000|TR0|
20110129000423.000|20110129000425.000|TR0|KING:  And as you mentioned, 2:00 a.m. in 
20110129000425.000|20110129000428.000|TR0|the morning.  Take us through what is 
20110129000428.000|20110129000431.000|TR0|expected.  Have we already heard from the 
20110129000431.000|20110129000433.000|TR0|protesters about organizations for 
20110129000433.000|20110129000436.000|TR0|tomorrow, and not only in Cairo but 
20110129000436.000|20110129000439.000|TR0|elsewhere in Egypt?
20110129000439.000|20110129000441.000|TR0|
20110129000441.000|20110129000444.000|TR0|PLEITGEN:  Well we haven't heard very much 
20110129000444.000|20110129000447.000|TR0|about the specific organizations.  But one 
20110129000447.000|20110129000450.000|TR0|of the things that we have to emphasize is 
20110129000450.000|20110129000452.000|TR0|that communications in this country right 
20110129000452.000|20110129000455.000|TR0|now have basically been shut down.  What 
20110129000455.000|20110129000458.000|TR0|has happened is they've shut down the 
20110129000458.000|20110129000500.000|TR0|Internet.  They've shut down cell phone 
20110129000500.000|20110129000503.000|TR0|communications, text messages as well, so 
20110129000503.000|20110129000506.000|TR0|it is very difficult for these protesters 
20110129000506.000|20110129000508.000|TR0|to communicate.
20110129000508.000|20110129000511.000|TR0|
20110129000511.000|20110129000514.000|TR0|That, of course, hasn't stopped this 
20110129000514.000|20110129000516.000|TR0|massive melee that took place here in 
20110129000516.000|20110129000519.000|TR0|Cairo and in other cities in Egypt 
20110129000519.000|20110129000522.000|TR0|throughout the day. Now, what people have 
20110129000522.000|20110129000525.000|TR0|been telling me is that they don't plan to 
20110129000525.000|20110129000527.000|TR0|let down.  They say that they are going to 
20110129000527.000|20110129000530.000|TR0|conduct more protests in the coming days.  
20110129000530.000|20110129000533.000|TR0|They're going to keep going on the streets 
20110129000533.000|20110129000535.000|TR0|until their demands are met.  Now many of 
20110129000535.000|20110129000538.000|TR0|them are saying they want better chances 
20110129000538.000|20110129000541.000|TR0|for jobs.  They want more social freedom.
20110129000541.000|20110129000543.000|TR0|
20110129000543.000|20110129000546.000|TR0|But the main thing that most people are 
20110129000546.000|20110129000549.000|TR0|saying is that they want President Mubarak 
20110129000549.000|20110129000551.000|TR0|to step down.  Clearly that has not 
20110129000551.000|20110129000554.000|TR0|happened.  And they were saying that they 
20110129000554.000|20110129000557.000|TR0|were going out into the streets until that 
20110129000557.000|20110129000600.000|TR0|happens.  And clearly a lot of the 
20110129000600.000|20110129000602.000|TR0|protesters that we saw on the streets here 
20110129000602.000|20110129000605.000|TR0|were very much emboldened that despite the 
20110129000605.000|20110129000608.000|TR0|fact that they got hit by tear gas, they 
20110129000608.000|20110129000610.000|TR0|got beaten, they did in many cases manage 
20110129000610.000|20110129000613.000|TR0|to beat the police force back that was on 
20110129000613.000|20110129000616.000|TR0|the street to prevent exactly what 
20110129000616.000|20110129000618.000|TR0|happened today from happening -- John.
20110129000618.000|20110129000621.000|TR0|
20110129000621.000|20110129000624.000|TR0|KING:  And Fred, help us understand.  You 
20110129000624.000|20110129000627.000|TR0|mentioned the encounters with the police.  
20110129000627.000|20110129000629.000|TR0|Later in the day it was more of an army 
20110129000629.000|20110129000632.000|TR0|presence and less of a police presence.  
20110129000632.000|20110129000635.000|TR0|Explain to our viewers especially in the 
20110129000635.000|20110129000637.000|TR0|United States the significance of that.    
20110129000637.000|20110129000640.000|TR0|   PLEITGEN:  Huge significance.  Huge 
20110129000640.000|20110129000643.000|TR0|significance because it is something that 
20110129000643.000|20110129000645.000|TR0|hasn't happened here in this country in 
20110129000645.000|20110129000648.000|TR0|decades.  First of all, what you have to 
20110129000648.000|20110129000651.000|TR0|understand is that the police is really a 
20110129000651.000|20110129000653.000|TR0|hated organization here in this country.  
20110129000653.000|20110129000656.000|TR0|A lot of people have witnessed police 
20110129000656.000|20110129000659.000|TR0|brutality; have been beaten up by police 
20110129000659.000|20110129000702.000|TR0|officers. You could see how the police 
20110129000702.000|20110129000704.000|TR0|force was a lightning rod and it was also 
20110129000704.000|20110129000707.000|TR0|using massive force against the people, 
20110129000707.000|20110129000710.000|TR0|against the demonstrators here in the 
20110129000710.000|20110129000712.000|TR0|streets.
20110129000712.000|20110129000715.000|TR0|
20110129000715.000|20110129000718.000|TR0|As I said, they were using tear gas.  We 
20110129000718.000|20110129000720.000|TR0|heard reports that they were firing live 
20110129000720.000|20110129000723.000|TR0|rounds into the crowds, also that they 
20110129000723.000|20110129000726.000|TR0|were using rubber bullets as well.  
20110129000726.000|20110129000729.000|TR0|Clearly this is an organization that is 
20110129000729.000|20110129000731.000|TR0|despised by the people.  Not just the 
20110129000731.000|20110129000734.000|TR0|regular police.  There is also a plain 
20110129000734.000|20110129000737.000|TR0|clothes police force which the Egyptians 
20110129000737.000|20110129000739.000|TR0|simply refer to as the thugs.  The 
20110129000739.000|20110129000742.000|TR0|military is a much different sort of force.
20110129000742.000|20110129000745.000|TR0|
20110129000745.000|20110129000747.000|TR0|When they came into the streets, they were 
20110129000747.000|20110129000750.000|TR0|greeted by the people. The people were 
20110129000750.000|20110129000753.000|TR0|chanting, the military and the people of 
20110129000753.000|20110129000755.000|TR0|Egypt, we are one.  So clearly this is a 
20110129000755.000|20110129000758.000|TR0|force that has much more of the respect, 
20110129000758.000|20110129000801.000|TR0|of the Egyptian people.  But on the other 
20110129000801.000|20110129000804.000|TR0|hand, of course, you can see that this is 
20110129000804.000|20110129000806.000|TR0|really a ground rattling demonstration 
20110129000806.000|20110129000809.000|TR0|that is going on when you have armored 
20110129000809.000|20110129000812.000|TR0|vehicles with 50-caliber gun turrets on 
20110129000812.000|20110129000814.000|TR0|them driving through the streets of Cairo 
20110129000814.000|20110129000817.000|TR0|and positioning themselves outside of key 
20110129000817.000|20110129000820.000|TR0|government buildings -- John.

20110129000833.000|20110129000836.000|TR0|check in with him, but let's continue our 
20110129000836.000|20110129000839.000|TR0|conversation right now with two men who 
20110129000839.000|20110129000841.000|TR0|know this country and know this region

20110129000900.000|20110129000903.000|TR0|Policy here.  Neil, you lived in Cairo for 
20110129000903.000|20110129000906.000|TR0|quite some time.  President Mubarak 
20110129000906.000|20110129000908.000|TR0|tonight seems to make the calculation that 
20110129000908.000|20110129000911.000|TR0|he can put this genie back in the bottle.  
20110129000911.000|20110129000914.000|TR0|The question is can he?
20110129000914.000|20110129000916.000|TR0|
20110129000916.000|20110129000919.000|TR0|NEIL MACFARQUHAR, FORMER N.Y. TIMES CAIRO 
20110129000919.000|20110129000922.000|TR0|BUREAU CHIEF:  You know Egyptians seem to 
20110129000922.000|20110129000924.000|TR0|be playing by their standard play book.  
20110129000924.000|20110129000927.000|TR0|You kind of deploy the police.  And if 
20110129000927.000|20110129000930.000|TR0|that doesn't work, you get on TV and you 
20110129000930.000|20110129000933.000|TR0|make a few concessions.  But the Egyptian 
20110129000933.000|20110129000935.000|TR0|people are slow to anger. But once they 
20110129000935.000|20110129000938.000|TR0|get angry, they really burn.  And given 
20110129000938.000|20110129000941.000|TR0|the numbers that we've seen on the 
20110129000941.000|20110129000943.000|TR0|streets, the kind of people participating, 
20110129000943.000|20110129000946.000|TR0|and the sort of social and economic 
20110129000946.000|20110129000949.000|TR0|demands they're making, I'm not sure the 
20110129000949.000|20110129000951.000|TR0|standard playbook of just sort of change 
20110129000951.000|20110129000954.000|TR0|the government will appease them.
20110129000954.000|20110129000957.000|TR0|
20110129000957.000|20110129000959.000|TR0|KING:  And Professor Telhami, address what 
20110129000959.000|20110129001002.000|TR0|Neil just said.  It's an excellent 
20110129001002.000|20110129001005.000|TR0|insight.  He says this is bubbling up and 
20110129001005.000|20110129001008.000|TR0|you know they're slow to anger, but once 
20110129001008.000|20110129001010.000|TR0|they anger, you track public opinion in 
20110129001010.000|20110129001013.000|TR0|the region.  You're in touch with people 
20110129001013.000|20110129001016.000|TR0|in the region.  Is this now, have we 
20110129001016.000|20110129001018.000|TR0|tipped from demands for evolution to 
20110129001018.000|20110129001021.000|TR0|demands for revolution?
20110129001021.000|20110129001024.000|TR0|
20110129001024.000|20110129001026.000|TR0|SHIBLEY TELHAMI, SR. FELLOW, SABAN CENTER 
20110129001026.000|20110129001029.000|TR0|FOR MIDEAST POLICY:  I think the aura of 
20110129001029.000|20110129001032.000|TR0|the state has been broken.  I think 
20110129001032.000|20110129001034.000|TR0|there's been an aura that has basically 
20110129001034.000|20110129001037.000|TR0|deterred a lot of people from going out in 
20110129001037.000|20110129001040.000|TR0|masses.  The security service is the sense 
20110129001040.000|20110129001043.000|TR0|of the bigness and the power of the state 
20110129001043.000|20110129001045.000|TR0|I think it's broken.  We have not seen the 
20110129001045.000|20110129001048.000|TR0|scale that we have witnessed today in 
20110129001048.000|20110129001051.000|TR0|Egypt.
20110129001051.000|20110129001053.000|TR0|
20110129001053.000|20110129001056.000|TR0|Obviously I think when some of it had to 
20110129001056.000|20110129001059.000|TR0|do with the spillover from Tunisia.  But 
20110129001059.000|20110129001101.000|TR0|this is pent up and it is out there.  You 
20110129001101.000|20110129001104.000|TR0|know the real question is can it be 
20110129001104.000|20110129001107.000|TR0|sustained?  I know what we've witnessed 
20110129001107.000|20110129001110.000|TR0|today is extraordinary.  It is something 
20110129001110.000|20110129001112.000|TR0|the likes of which of we have not seen.  
20110129001112.000|20110129001115.000|TR0|It's going to have consequences no matter 
20110129001115.000|20110129001118.000|TR0|what.  But the real, first thing to watch 
20110129001118.000|20110129001120.000|TR0|is can this be sustained?  Will they pour 
20110129001120.000|20110129001123.000|TR0|out tomorrow in the same large numbers as 
20110129001123.000|20110129001126.000|TR0|today or will it die down? That's of 
20110129001126.000|20110129001128.000|TR0|course the first measure of understanding 
20110129001128.000|20110129001131.000|TR0|how important it is.
20110129001131.000|20110129001134.000|TR0|
20110129001134.000|20110129001136.000|TR0|KING:  And Neil, as we watch, that as we 
20110129001136.000|20110129001139.000|TR0|watch what happens in the next 24 to 48 
20110129001139.000|20110129001142.000|TR0|hours in Egypt, not only in Cairo but 
20110129001142.000|20110129001145.000|TR0|across the great swath of Egypt, what is 
20110129001145.000|20110129001147.000|TR0|your number one question for what happens 
20110129001147.000|20110129001150.000|TR0|within the borders and then address the 
20110129001150.000|20110129001153.000|TR0|potential domino effect in the region, 
20110129001153.000|20110129001155.000|TR0|given Egypt's historic role as the beacon 
20110129001155.000|20110129001158.000|TR0|in the region?
20110129001158.000|20110129001201.000|TR0|
20110129001201.000|20110129001203.000|TR0|MACFARQUHAR:  I think you know that the 
20110129001203.000|20110129001206.000|TR0|government has to walk a very fine line 
20110129001206.000|20110129001209.000|TR0|about how much violence they use to 
20110129001209.000|20110129001212.000|TR0|suppress it because the more violence they 
20110129001212.000|20110129001214.000|TR0|use, it may have the opposite effect and 
20110129001214.000|20110129001217.000|TR0|drive more people on to the streets.  And 
20110129001217.000|20110129001220.000|TR0|also you know the military; President 
20110129001220.000|20110129001222.000|TR0|Mubarak has made sure to tamp down any 
20110129001222.000|20110129001225.000|TR0|political aspirations in the military.
20110129001225.000|20110129001228.000|TR0|
20110129001228.000|20110129001230.000|TR0|But you know they have to be asking 
20110129001230.000|20110129001233.000|TR0|themselves how far they're willing to go 
20110129001233.000|20110129001236.000|TR0|to suppress this.  He hasn't really used 
20110129001236.000|20110129001238.000|TR0|them.  You know he uses tanks and stuff 
20110129001238.000|20110129001241.000|TR0|outside big public buildings, the Foreign 
20110129001241.000|20110129001244.000|TR0|Ministry, the Ministry of Communications.  
20110129001244.000|20110129001247.000|TR0|You know but using them to protect 
20110129001247.000|20110129001249.000|TR0|buildings is one thing.  Using them to 
20110129001249.000|20110129001252.000|TR0|fire on crowds is another.  So you know 
20110129001252.000|20110129001255.000|TR0|that is something that might make, you 
20110129001255.000|20110129001257.000|TR0|know cause the formula to tip a little bit.
20110129001257.000|20110129001300.000|TR0|
20110129001300.000|20110129001303.000|TR0|And Egypt is, of course, you know it's a 
20110129001303.000|20110129001305.000|TR0|fulcrum in the region. It has long been a 
20110129001305.000|20110129001308.000|TR0|cultural capital.  It's the most populist 
20110129001308.000|20110129001311.000|TR0|nation, the biggest military.  You know 
20110129001311.000|20110129001314.000|TR0|it's just something that all Arabs look to 
20110129001314.000|20110129001316.000|TR0|for sort of their cultural, their 
20110129001316.000|20110129001319.000|TR0|political guidance.  So if Egypt falls, it 
20110129001319.000|20110129001322.000|TR0|is really a pretty big domino.  And of 
20110129001322.000|20110129001324.000|TR0|course, the United States, it is an 
20110129001324.000|20110129001327.000|TR0|incredibly nervous moment for them because 
20110129001327.000|20110129001330.000|TR0|it is a lynchpin for them for stability in 
20110129001330.000|20110129001332.000|TR0|the region.
20110129001332.000|20110129001335.000|TR0|
20110129001335.000|20110129001338.000|TR0|It's a lynchpin for you know trying to

20110129001340.000|20110129001343.000|TR0|peace process, trying to move it forward.  
20110129001343.000|20110129001346.000|TR0|The Egyptians have been you know 
20110129001346.000|20110129001349.000|TR0|instrumental in trying to get the 
20110129001349.000|20110129001351.000|TR0|Palestinians to move forward.  And just 
20110129001351.000|20110129001354.000|TR0|the sort of whole structure of American 
20110129001354.000|20110129001357.000|TR0|foreign policy in the region is built on 
20110129001357.000|20110129001359.000|TR0|the fact that Egypt has been fairly 
20110129001359.000|20110129001402.000|TR0|stable.  So if that goes, they're going to 
20110129001402.000|20110129001405.000|TR0|be scrambling.  And I think you see that a 
20110129001405.000|20110129001407.000|TR0|little bit in the wariness of the reaction.

20110129001410.000|20110129001413.000|TR0|KING:  Let's listen to a bit of what 
20110129001413.000|20110129001416.000|TR0|President Mubarak said.  It was after a 
20110129001416.000|20110129001418.000|TR0|day of protests, unprecedented pictures of 
20110129001418.000|20110129001421.000|TR0|demonstrations in the streets.  We saw the 
20110129001421.000|20110129001424.000|TR0|flames.  We saw the demonstrations.  We 
20110129001424.000|20110129001426.000|TR0|heard the chants for regime change.  The 
20110129001426.000|20110129001429.000|TR0|president finally came on television.  He 
20110129001429.000|20110129001432.000|TR0|did say his government ministers would 
20110129001432.000|20110129001434.000|TR0|resign.  But he said he would stay in 
20110129001434.000|20110129001437.000|TR0|power and he was quite defiant.  Let's 
20110129001437.000|20110129001440.000|TR0|listen.

20110129001507.000|20110129001509.000|TR0|is a very little line between freedom and

20110129001523.000|20110129001526.000|TR0|lost touch with his people?

20110129001528.000|20110129001531.000|TR0|MACFARQUHAR:  You know I mean The fact 
20110129001531.000|20110129001534.000|TR0|that he has been there for 30 years and he 
20110129001534.000|20110129001536.000|TR0|has convinced himself that he alone among

20110129001539.000|20110129001542.000|TR0|capable of ruling the country is a pretty 
20110129001542.000|20110129001544.000|TR0|key sign that he lost touch a while ago.  
20110129001544.000|20110129001547.000|TR0|And you know I don't know what he is 
20110129001547.000|20110129001550.000|TR0|seeing but I don't know if he realizes the 
20110129001550.000|20110129001553.000|TR0|extent of the anger that he is facing on

20110129001711.000|20110129001713.000|TR0|He said he had just called President Hosni 
20110129001713.000|20110129001716.000|TR0|Mubarak of Egypt, urged him, urged him to

20110129001738.000|20110129001740.000|TR0|government to reverse the actions that 
20110129001740.000|20110129001743.000|TR0|they've taken to interfere with access to 
20110129001743.000|20110129001746.000|TR0|the Internet, the cell phone service, and 
20110129001746.000|20110129001748.000|TR0|to social networks that do so much to 
20110129001748.000|20110129001751.000|TR0|connect people in the 21st Century.  At 
20110129001751.000|20110129001754.000|TR0|the same time, those protesting in the 
20110129001754.000|20110129001757.000|TR0|streets have a responsibility to express 
20110129001757.000|20110129001759.000|TR0|themselves peacefully.  Violence and 
20110129001759.000|20110129001802.000|TR0|destruction will not lead to the reforms

20110129001815.000|20110129001818.000|TR0|officials tell us they were highly 
20110129001818.000|20110129001821.000|TR0|disappointed that President Mubarak did 
20110129001821.000|20110129001823.000|TR0|not reach out and promised to open a 
20110129001823.000|20110129001826.000|TR0|dialogue with the demonstrators in his 
20110129001826.000|20110129001829.000|TR0|speech. Others in the United States 
20110129001829.000|20110129001832.000|TR0|government are also disappointed.  A short 
20110129001832.000|20110129001834.000|TR0|time ago I spoke to Senator John Kerry of 
20110129001834.000|20110129001837.000|TR0|Massachusetts.  He is the Chairman of the 
20110129001837.000|20110129001840.000|TR0|Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  And I 
20110129001840.000|20110129001842.000|TR0|began by asking him if the Egyptian 
20110129001842.000|20110129001845.000|TR0|government does not do more to accommodate 
20110129001845.000|20110129001848.000|TR0|the protesters, should the United States

20110129001850.000|20110129001853.000|TR0|generous aid to Egypt.

20110129001904.000|20110129001907.000|TR0|CHAIRMAN:  Well I think that look let's 
20110129001907.000|20110129001909.000|TR0|not put the cart ahead of the horse.  
20110129001909.000|20110129001912.000|TR0|There are a lot of things before we get to 
20110129001912.000|20110129001915.000|TR0|that.  We obviously have a lot of tools. 
20110129001915.000|20110129001917.000|TR0|But the important thing here is to try to 
20110129001917.000|20110129001920.000|TR0|build on what happened in Tunisia in a way 
20110129001920.000|20110129001923.000|TR0|that restores a sense of future and 
20110129001923.000|20110129001925.000|TR0|possibilities of the region.  And 
20110129001925.000|20110129001928.000|TR0|hopefully avoids the street clashes and 
20110129001928.000|20110129001931.000|TR0|confrontation and loss of life and 
20110129001931.000|20110129001934.000|TR0|violence as the way we're going to go 
20110129001934.000|20110129001936.000|TR0|forward here.
20110129001936.000|20110129001939.000|TR0|
20110129001939.000|20110129001942.000|TR0|I think there could be a peaceful outcome. 
20110129001942.000|20110129001944.000|TR0| But as I said, it depends really on 
20110129001944.000|20110129001947.000|TR0|President Mubarak's response to this 
20110129001947.000|20110129001950.000|TR0|crisis.  One of the things that I think he 
20110129001950.000|20110129001952.000|TR0|could do, which might be constructive, is 
20110129001952.000|20110129001955.000|TR0|to talk with his son and his son to talk 
20110129001955.000|20110129001958.000|TR0|with him and to sort of recognize the 
20110129001958.000|20110129002000.000|TR0|frustrations that have built up and what 
20110129002000.000|20110129002003.000|TR0|the needs are now.  And perhaps defer his 
20110129002003.000|20110129002006.000|TR0|son's ambitions for the moment or ask him 
20110129002006.000|20110129002009.000|TR0|to in a way that sort of promises some 
20110129002009.000|20110129002011.000|TR0|kind of succession process that opens the 
20110129002011.000|20110129002014.000|TR0|process up.  But still respects the 
20110129002014.000|20110129002017.000|TR0|leadership that he has given over these 
20110129002017.000|20110129002019.000|TR0|years.  I think there is a way forward.  
20110129002019.000|20110129002022.000|TR0|And the key is in the response in the 
20110129002022.000|20110129002025.000|TR0|streets.

20110129002033.000|20110129002036.000|TR0|airing their grievances against President 
20110129002036.000|20110129002038.000|TR0|Mubarak is that the United States

20110129002041.000|20110129002044.000|TR0|because of that strategic alliance, 
20110129002044.000|20110129002046.000|TR0|because of his role in the peace process 
20110129002046.000|20110129002049.000|TR0|that perhaps we have not been as 
20110129002049.000|20110129002052.000|TR0|persistent and as consistent in demanding 
20110129002052.000|20110129002054.000|TR0|openness, political reforms, the 
20110129002054.000|20110129002057.000|TR0|construction of other democratic 
20110129002057.000|20110129002100.000|TR0|institutions, so that it is not just the 
20110129002100.000|20110129002102.000|TR0|Mubarak family.  Is that a fair criticism, 
20110129002102.000|20110129002105.000|TR0|sir?
20110129002105.000|20110129002108.000|TR0|
20110129002108.000|20110129002111.000|TR0|KERRY:  In terms of the sort of what has 
20110129002111.000|20110129002113.000|TR0|taken place in public, some people might 
20110129002113.000|20110129002116.000|TR0|find a legitimate argument there, but in 
20110129002116.000|20110129002119.000|TR0|private, no, it is not legitimate.  In 
20110129002119.000|20110129002121.000|TR0|every conversation that I know high level 
20110129002121.000|20110129002124.000|TR0|officials have had, Vice President Biden, 
20110129002124.000|20110129002127.000|TR0|Secretary Clinton, conversations I've had 
20110129002127.000|20110129002129.000|TR0|through the years, we have always raised 
20110129002129.000|20110129002132.000|TR0|with him issues of democracy.  I can 
20110129002132.000|20110129002135.000|TR0|remember talking with him very 
20110129002135.000|20110129002138.000|TR0|specifically about specific political 
20110129002138.000|20110129002140.000|TR0|prisoners, about the election process, 
20110129002140.000|20110129002143.000|TR0|about the control of the media, about 
20110129002143.000|20110129002146.000|TR0|opening up that process.
20110129002146.000|20110129002148.000|TR0|
20110129002148.000|20110129002151.000|TR0|But always, there was the Muslim 
20110129002151.000|20110129002154.000|TR0|brotherhood that was there that was 
20110129002154.000|20110129002156.000|TR0|proffered as a rationale for why they had 
20110129002156.000|20110129002159.000|TR0|to be pretty tough.  And I'm afraid that 
20110129002159.000|20110129002202.000|TR0|what has happened through the years is 
20110129002202.000|20110129002204.000|TR0|that legitimate democracy activists have 
20110129002204.000|20110129002207.000|TR0|been swept in to that umbrella.  And I 
20110129002207.000|20110129002210.000|TR0|think that's part of the building 
20110129002210.000|20110129002213.000|TR0|frustration.  That has run its course now. 
20110129002213.000|20110129002215.000|TR0|And so this is a moment where President 
20110129002215.000|20110129002218.000|TR0|Mubarak really has to be the statesman.
20110129002218.000|20110129002221.000|TR0|
20110129002221.000|20110129002223.000|TR0|KING:  Is it perhaps time to cast aside 
20110129002223.000|20110129002226.000|TR0|the old rules of diploma? You make an 
20110129002226.000|20110129002229.000|TR0|interesting point and an important point 
20110129002229.000|20110129002231.000|TR0|that in private you can be very tough with 
20110129002231.000|20110129002234.000|TR0|a president like Mr. Mubarak.  Publicly 
20110129002234.000|20110129002237.000|TR0|you might not want to do that, but then 
20110129002237.000|20110129002240.000|TR0|what you get as a result, Senator Kerry, 
20110129002240.000|20110129002242.000|TR0|is that the people don't trust us, a lot 
20110129002242.000|20110129002245.000|TR0|of anti-American sentiment.  Should we be 
20110129002245.000|20110129002248.000|TR0|more public in this new age of open 
20110129002248.000|20110129002250.000|TR0|communication of the Internet and social 
20110129002250.000|20110129002253.000|TR0|networking?
20110129002253.000|20110129002256.000|TR0|
20110129002256.000|20110129002258.000|TR0|KERRY:  Well I think the answer is yes and 
20110129002258.000|20110129002301.000|TR0|I think that the administration has been 
20110129002301.000|20110129002304.000|TR0|pretty clear today, but you also want to 
20110129002304.000|20110129002306.000|TR0|do it in a way that doesn't invite 
20110129002306.000|20110129002309.000|TR0|recklessness, doesn't invite more 
20110129002309.000|20110129002312.000|TR0|violence.  That really helps, I think, the 
20110129002312.000|20110129002315.000|TR0|art here is to have effective diplomacy 
20110129002315.000|20110129002317.000|TR0|that makes it clear as the president did, 
20110129002317.000|20110129002320.000|TR0|I think, in his statements in the last few 
20110129002320.000|20110129002323.000|TR0|days.  That the United States is first and 
20110129002323.000|20110129002325.000|TR0|foremost concerned about the rights of 
20110129002325.000|20110129002328.000|TR0|people and first and foremost concerned 
20110129002328.000|20110129002331.000|TR0|about the protection of people in the 
20110129002331.000|20110129002333.000|TR0|street and to try to avoid a violent 
20110129002333.000|20110129002336.000|TR0|confrontation between the military and the 
20110129002336.000|20110129002339.000|TR0|citizens of the country.  And I think we 
20110129002339.000|20110129002342.000|TR0|are, as the president made clear in Cairo 
20110129002342.000|20110129002344.000|TR0|ironically where he gave his speech, we're 
20110129002344.000|20110129002347.000|TR0|on the side of democracy.
20110129002347.000|20110129002350.000|TR0|
20110129002350.000|20110129002352.000|TR0|We're on the side of people being able to 
20110129002352.000|20110129002355.000|TR0|exercise those rights and I think that's 
20110129002355.000|20110129002358.000|TR0|squarely where we stand, but we also stand 
20110129002358.000|20110129002400.000|TR0|for doing it in a way, for making that 
20110129002400.000|20110129002403.000|TR0|point and for helping to create a 
20110129002403.000|20110129002406.000|TR0|transition that works for the people, 
20110129002406.000|20110129002408.000|TR0|works for the region and works for really 
20110129002408.000|20110129002411.000|TR0|the you know avoidance of the kind of 
20110129002411.000|20110129002414.000|TR0|chaos that could ensue if everybody simply 
20110129002414.000|20110129002417.000|TR0|throws fuel on the fire.  I think 
20110129002417.000|20110129002419.000|TR0|everybody understands where we stand here. 
20110129002419.000|20110129002422.000|TR0| And you know there may have been mistakes 
20110129002422.000|20110129002425.000|TR0|in the past but I think the key here is an 
20110129002425.000|20110129002427.000|TR0|encouraging process that empowers people 
20110129002427.000|20110129002430.000|TR0|but does so in a very responsible way.  I 
20110129002430.000|20110129002433.000|TR0|think that's possible.
20110129002433.000|20110129002435.000|TR0|
20110129002435.000|20110129002438.000|TR0|KING:  You made a bold point a bit earlier 
20110129002438.000|20110129002441.000|TR0|in the interview saying that in your best 
20110129002441.000|20110129002444.000|TR0|advice would be for President Mubarak to 
20110129002444.000|20110129002446.000|TR0|talk to his son and essentially set the 
20110129002446.000|20110129002449.000|TR0|family ambitions aside and clear a path 
20110129002449.000|20110129002452.000|TR0|for an open presidential election.  I 
20110129002452.000|20110129002454.000|TR0|assume is your point without a Mubarak on 
20110129002454.000|20110129002457.000|TR0|the ballot next time.  Do you have any 
20110129002457.000|20110129002500.000|TR0|fears that even if you got that wish, sir, 
20110129002500.000|20110129002502.000|TR0|what next?  Because of the lack of 
20110129002502.000|20110129002505.000|TR0|democratic institutions, do you have a 
20110129002505.000|20110129002508.000|TR0|concern as the chairman of the Senate 
20110129002508.000|20110129002510.000|TR0|Foreign Relations Committee that what 
20110129002510.000|20110129002513.000|TR0|might happen next might not be "A", as 
20110129002513.000|20110129002516.000|TR0|stable and "B", as friendly to the United 
20110129002516.000|20110129002519.000|TR0|States?
20110129002519.000|20110129002521.000|TR0|
20110129002521.000|20110129002524.000|TR0|KERRY:  Look, we have to take those lumps 
20110129002524.000|20110129002527.000|TR0|as they come.  And sometimes you literally 
20110129002527.000|20110129002529.000|TR0|have to just let the chips fall where they 
20110129002529.000|20110129002532.000|TR0|may.  I'm confident that the people of 
20110129002532.000|20110129002535.000|TR0|Egypt want a future just like other people 
20110129002535.000|20110129002537.000|TR0|in the world want a future where people 
20110129002537.000|20110129002540.000|TR0|are not subject to bombs and violence and 
20110129002540.000|20110129002543.000|TR0|beheadings and extremism.  It's a very 
20110129002543.000|20110129002545.000|TR0|sophisticated civil society with great 
20110129002545.000|20110129002548.000|TR0|contributions through all of history to 
20110129002548.000|20110129002551.000|TR0|all of us.  I really feel strongly that 
20110129002551.000|20110129002554.000|TR0|under the right circumstances this could 
20110129002554.000|20110129002556.000|TR0|be a peaceful and positive transformation, 
20110129002556.000|20110129002559.000|TR0|notwithstanding the presence of extremists 
20110129002559.000|20110129002602.000|TR0|like the Muslim brotherhood and others.
20110129002602.000|20110129002604.000|TR0|
20110129002604.000|20110129002607.000|TR0|The key to that is going to be how 
20110129002607.000|20110129002610.000|TR0|President Mubarak chooses to empower the 
20110129002610.000|20110129002612.000|TR0|people.  It is my personal judgment -- I 
20110129002612.000|20110129002615.000|TR0|am not speaking for the administration -- 
20110129002615.000|20110129002618.000|TR0|I am not speaking for anybody else except 
20110129002618.000|20110129002621.000|TR0|myself.  But it is my judgment from what I 
20110129002621.000|20110129002623.000|TR0|know of people there and of my own trips 
20110129002623.000|20110129002626.000|TR0|there that one of the things that has 
20110129002626.000|20110129002629.000|TR0|fostered a lack of credibility in the 
20110129002629.000|20110129002631.000|TR0|government and questions about the future 
20110129002631.000|20110129002634.000|TR0|is this sense that they were trying to 
20110129002634.000|20110129002637.000|TR0|engineer a less than transparent and 
20110129002637.000|20110129002639.000|TR0|accountable election process that would 
20110129002639.000|20110129002642.000|TR0|result in a dynastic leadership.  I think 
20110129002642.000|20110129002645.000|TR0|that's a mistake personally.  And I also 
20110129002645.000|20110129002647.000|TR0|think that the events that are unfolding 
20110129002647.000|20110129002650.000|TR0|in the streets of Egypt right now are in 
20110129002650.000|20110129002653.000|TR0|fact the predicate by the Egyptian people 
20110129002653.000|20110129002656.000|TR0|to making that clear.

20110129002658.000|20110129002701.000|TR0|KING:  Senator John Kerry, the chairman of

20110129002704.000|20110129002706.000|TR0|sir thanks for your time on this important 
20110129002706.000|20110129002709.000|TR0|day.

20110129002712.000|20110129002714.000|TR0|KERRY:  Thank you.

20110129002736.000|20110129002739.000|TR0|words now coming from the Obama White 
20110129002739.000|20110129002741.000|TR0|House.  Will they have impact?  We'll be 
20110129002741.000|20110129002744.000|TR0|back in just a minute -- more of this

20110129002755.000|20110129002758.000|TR0|KING:  Live pictures there from our CNN 
20110129002758.000|20110129002800.000|TR0|Cairo Bureau.  Of course we're continuing 
20110129002800.000|20110129002803.000|TR0|to watch the streets of Cairo to see what 
20110129002803.000|20110129002806.000|TR0|happens in the wake of President Mubarak's 
20110129002806.000|20110129002808.000|TR0|defiant speech to the Egyptian people 
20110129002808.000|20110129002811.000|TR0|saying he plans to stay in power and 
20110129002811.000|20110129002814.000|TR0|urging them not -- urging them not to 
20110129002814.000|20110129002816.000|TR0|demonstrate further in the streets.
20110129002816.000|20110129002819.000|TR0|
20110129002819.000|20110129002822.000|TR0|Obviously this situation is being watched 
20110129002822.000|20110129002825.000|TR0|here in the United States, across the Arab 
20110129002825.000|20110129002827.000|TR0|world and in Israel.  Israel made peace 
20110129002827.000|20110129002830.000|TR0|with Egypt years ago and is watching now 
20110129002830.000|20110129002833.000|TR0|to see if the Mubarak government can 
20110129002833.000|20110129002835.000|TR0|withstand this pressure.

20110129002838.000|20110129002841.000|TR0|Our Jerusalem Bureau Chief Kevin Flower 
20110129002841.000|20110129002843.000|TR0|joins us now and Kevin is the Israeli 
20110129002843.000|20110129002846.000|TR0|government watching quietly or are they 
20110129002846.000|20110129002849.000|TR0|speaking out?
20110129002849.000|20110129002851.000|TR0|
20110129002851.000|20110129002854.000|TR0|KEVIN FLOWER, CNN JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF:  
20110129002854.000|20110129002857.000|TR0|Very quietly, the sounds of silence here, 
20110129002857.000|20110129002900.000|TR0|John, as the Israeli government has yet to 
20110129002900.000|20110129002902.000|TR0|comment in any way for the past couple of 
20110129002902.000|20110129002905.000|TR0|days, but nothing, nothing tonight as the 
20110129002905.000|20110129002908.000|TR0|events in Cairo and the rest of Egypt got 
20110129002908.000|20110129002910.000|TR0|a lot more dramatic.  A couple of days ago 
20110129002910.000|20110129002913.000|TR0|we did hear from a few government 
20110129002913.000|20110129002916.000|TR0|officials saying that they thought that 
20110129002916.000|20110129002918.000|TR0|President Mubarak could weather this storm.
20110129002918.000|20110129002921.000|TR0|
20110129002921.000|20110129002924.000|TR0|I think tonight Israeli officials are 
20110129002924.000|20110129002927.000|TR0|taking a closer look at those assessments 
20110129002927.000|20110129002929.000|TR0|and wondering to themselves what is going 
20110129002929.000|20110129002932.000|TR0|to happen here.  This Israeli government 
20110129002932.000|20110129002935.000|TR0|does not want to see a regime change in 
20110129002935.000|20110129002937.000|TR0|Egypt.  They do not want to see 
20110129002937.000|20110129002940.000|TR0|revolutionary change in Egypt.  Egypt is a 
20110129002940.000|20110129002943.000|TR0|vital, strategic partner, regional ally.  
20110129002943.000|20110129002945.000|TR0|It is Israel's closest regional ally.  For 
20110129002945.000|20110129002948.000|TR0|the past 28 years it has had a very good 
20110129002948.000|20110129002951.000|TR0|relationship, working relationship with 
20110129002951.000|20110129002953.000|TR0|President Mubarak.
20110129002953.000|20110129002956.000|TR0|
20110129002956.000|20110129002959.000|TR0|Although the peace is sometimes called a 
20110129002959.000|20110129003002.000|TR0|cold peace, they share a lot of interests. 
20110129003002.000|20110129003004.000|TR0| And most currently those are Iran and its 
20110129003004.000|20110129003007.000|TR0|proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon 
20110129003007.000|20110129003010.000|TR0|and in the Gaza Strip respectively. Those 
20110129003010.000|20110129003012.000|TR0|are some shared concerns, so Israel is 
20110129003012.000|20110129003015.000|TR0|looking warily on what's going on, on its 
20110129003015.000|20110129003018.000|TR0|southern border -- John.
20110129003018.000|20110129003020.000|TR0|
20110129003020.000|20110129003023.000|TR0|KING:  It's an interesting point you make 
20110129003023.000|20110129003026.000|TR0|and for those who don't follow the region 
20110129003026.000|20110129003028.000|TR0|closely on a day-to-day basis, let's 
20110129003028.000|20110129003031.000|TR0|expand a little bit because some might 
20110129003031.000|20110129003034.000|TR0|think wow Israel is a vibrant democracy.  
20110129003034.000|20110129003037.000|TR0|Why would it not want a more vibrant 
20110129003037.000|20110129003039.000|TR0|democracy to its south?  But this is a 
20110129003039.000|20110129003042.000|TR0|case of real politic.  This is a 
20110129003042.000|20110129003045.000|TR0|partnership, Kevin that's not perfect but 
20110129003045.000|20110129003047.000|TR0|it has worked for the Israelis.  It is the 
20110129003047.000|20110129003050.000|TR0|one, if you will, peaceful, trustworthy 
20110129003050.000|20110129003053.000|TR0|relationship they have in the Arab world.
20110129003053.000|20110129003055.000|TR0|
20110129003055.000|20110129003058.000|TR0|FLOWER:  It is and with Jordan as well to 
20110129003058.000|20110129003101.000|TR0|a certain extent.  But it is exactly that. 
20110129003101.000|20110129003104.000|TR0| The -- what the Israelis want to see in 
20110129003104.000|20110129003106.000|TR0|the two neighboring countries that it has 
20110129003106.000|20110129003109.000|TR0|peace treaties with is stability above all 
20110129003109.000|20110129003112.000|TR0|else.  That is much more important than 
20110129003112.000|20110129003114.000|TR0|democratic rights; you know the rights of 
20110129003114.000|20110129003117.000|TR0|people to assemble freely.  Israel would 
20110129003117.000|20110129003120.000|TR0|certainly like the see that in the future, 
20110129003120.000|20110129003122.000|TR0|but it is worried about its security, 
20110129003122.000|20110129003125.000|TR0|about regional security.  It wants 
20110129003125.000|20110129003128.000|TR0|stability above all else.
20110129003128.000|20110129003130.000|TR0|
20110129003130.000|20110129003133.000|TR0|KING:  Kevin Flower our Jerusalem Bureau 
20110129003133.000|20110129003136.000|TR0|chief.  Kevin, we'll keep in touch with 
20110129003136.000|20110129003139.000|TR0|you as well as this dramatic situation 
20110129003139.000|20110129003141.000|TR0|unfolds. Let's go back to our conversation 
20110129003141.000|20110129003144.000|TR0|with Professor Shibley Telhami of the 
20110129003144.000|20110129003147.000|TR0|University of the Maryland and the Saban 
20110129003147.000|20110129003149.000|TR0|Center for Mideast Policy.  The domino 
20110129003149.000|20110129003152.000|TR0|effect -- Egypt's historic role as sort of 
20110129003152.000|20110129003155.000|TR0|the beacon, the largest, the founding 
20110129003155.000|20110129003157.000|TR0|civilization, if you will, of the Arab 
20110129003157.000|20110129003200.000|TR0|world, if this continues in Egypt, what 
20110129003200.000|20110129003203.000|TR0|are the conversations and the calculations 
20110129003203.000|20110129003206.000|TR0|in Jordan, in Saudi Arabia, in Morocco?
20110129003206.000|20110129003208.000|TR0|
20110129003208.000|20110129003211.000|TR0|TELHAMI:  You know even with Tunisia, not 
20110129003211.000|20110129003214.000|TR0|Egypt -- Egypt is obviously a -- you know 
20110129003214.000|20110129003216.000|TR0|a different order because it has 80 
20110129003216.000|20110129003219.000|TR0|million people, historically, a leader of 
20110129003219.000|20110129003222.000|TR0|the Arab world.  It is an anchor of 
20110129003222.000|20110129003224.000|TR0|American foreign policy since the 1970s.  
20110129003224.000|20110129003227.000|TR0|If there is change, no question it would 
20110129003227.000|20110129003230.000|TR0|have more ramifications than almost any 
20110129003230.000|20110129003232.000|TR0|other place in the Arab world.
20110129003232.000|20110129003235.000|TR0|
20110129003235.000|20110129003238.000|TR0|But even with Tunisia, we're talking about 
20110129003238.000|20110129003241.000|TR0|spillover.  The spillover really isn't 
20110129003241.000|20110129003243.000|TR0|just because somebody sets a trend.  When 
20110129003243.000|20110129003246.000|TR0|you look at what we've been tracing for 
20110129003246.000|20110129003249.000|TR0|the past decade and more, there has been a 
20110129003249.000|20110129003251.000|TR0|widening gap between publics and 
20110129003251.000|20110129003254.000|TR0|governments on almost every issue -- issue 
20110129003254.000|20110129003257.000|TR0|-- domestic issues, foreign policy issues, 
20110129003257.000|20110129003259.000|TR0|issues of identity, frustrated public, 
20110129003259.000|20110129003302.000|TR0|humiliated public.  The real puzzle for 
20110129003302.000|20110129003305.000|TR0|most of us, who are in the business of 
20110129003305.000|20110129003308.000|TR0|political science, is why haven't they 
20110129003308.000|20110129003310.000|TR0|revolted?  It is not a question of if 
20110129003310.000|20110129003313.000|TR0|there is a reason to revolt.  There have 
20110129003313.000|20110129003316.000|TR0|been a lot of reasons for people to revolt.
20110129003316.000|20110129003318.000|TR0|
20110129003318.000|20110129003321.000|TR0|So, what happened is obviously they 
20110129003321.000|20110129003324.000|TR0|haven't been able to do it. They haven't 
20110129003324.000|20110129003326.000|TR0|been able to organize.  They haven't 
20110129003326.000|20110129003329.000|TR0|broken through the barrier.  They haven't 
20110129003329.000|20110129003332.000|TR0|managed to get a lot of people into the 
20110129003332.000|20110129003334.000|TR0|streets.  And what we've seen in the 
20110129003334.000|20110129003337.000|TR0|Tunisia case, now in the Egypt case.  Is 
20110129003337.000|20110129003340.000|TR0|that there is something going on where 
20110129003340.000|20110129003343.000|TR0|people can get out in large numbers, 
20110129003343.000|20110129003345.000|TR0|organize, coordinate, without relying on 
20110129003345.000|20110129003348.000|TR0|an existing political party, the likes of 
20110129003348.000|20110129003351.000|TR0|which governments have repressed and 
20110129003351.000|20110129003353.000|TR0|managed to prevent.  So I think that's the 
20110129003353.000|20110129003356.000|TR0|empowerment.  The empowerment is they see 
20110129003356.000|20110129003359.000|TR0|a model that is working.  They have reason 
20110129003359.000|20110129003401.000|TR0|of their own.  They're not trying to just 
20110129003401.000|20110129003404.000|TR0|follow a trend.  They have reasons of 
20110129003404.000|20110129003407.000|TR0|their own to want to revolt in multiple 
20110129003407.000|20110129003410.000|TR0|countries in the Arab world.  And they see 
20110129003410.000|20110129003412.000|TR0|that it is working.  If they see it is 
20110129003412.000|20110129003415.000|TR0|working, it will be infectious.
20110129003415.000|20110129003418.000|TR0|
20110129003418.000|20110129003420.000|TR0|KING:  What is the impression, not in the 
20110129003420.000|20110129003423.000|TR0|governments, but on the street about this 
20110129003423.000|20110129003426.000|TR0|U.S. administration?  President Obama went 
20110129003426.000|20110129003428.000|TR0|to Cairo. That was where he was trying to 
20110129003428.000|20110129003431.000|TR0|begin a making up process, if you will, 
20110129003431.000|20110129003434.000|TR0|with the Arab and Muslim after the Bush 
20110129003434.000|20110129003436.000|TR0|administration.  He did talk about 
20110129003436.000|20110129003439.000|TR0|democracy there.  But the question is, did 
20110129003439.000|20110129003442.000|TR0|he follow through?  He said in that speech 
20110129003442.000|20110129003445.000|TR0|just having elections is not enough. If 
20110129003445.000|20110129003447.000|TR0|there is not a vibrant democratic system, 
20110129003447.000|20110129003450.000|TR0|then you had Secretary of State Clinton 
20110129003450.000|20110129003453.000|TR0|say President Mubarak is like a family 
20110129003453.000|20110129003455.000|TR0|friend.  There are some of those 
20110129003455.000|20110129003458.000|TR0|protesters on the street, Professor, 
20110129003458.000|20110129003501.000|TR0|saying they believe their president took 
20110129003501.000|20110129003503.000|TR0|that as a green light.  That he had a 
20110129003503.000|20110129003506.000|TR0|friendly administration that would allow 
20110129003506.000|20110129003509.000|TR0|him to go back to being more repressive.  
20110129003509.000|20110129003511.000|TR0|A fair point?
20110129003511.000|20110129003514.000|TR0|
20110129003514.000|20110129003517.000|TR0|TELHAMI:  I think there is no question 
20110129003517.000|20110129003520.000|TR0|that there is more frustration with the 
20110129003520.000|20110129003522.000|TR0|Obama administration after a year and a 
20110129003522.000|20110129003525.000|TR0|half in office.  No question about that.  
20110129003525.000|20110129003528.000|TR0|The real question isn't that.  We've 
20110129003528.000|20110129003530.000|TR0|traced it a year and a half ago, we know, 
20110129003530.000|20110129003533.000|TR0|obviously it has been longer than that.  
20110129003533.000|20110129003536.000|TR0|The real issue is not that.  The real 
20110129003536.000|20110129003538.000|TR0|issues are the blaming the Obama 
20110129003538.000|20110129003541.000|TR0|administration for what there is.  I 
20110129003541.000|20110129003544.000|TR0|happen to think it is the contrary.  That 
20110129003544.000|20110129003547.000|TR0|in fact, one reason why the Tunisian 
20110129003547.000|20110129003549.000|TR0|revolt turned into a revolution, and 
20110129003549.000|20110129003552.000|TR0|worked, is because the U.S. was not 
20110129003552.000|20110129003555.000|TR0|implicated in any shape or form.  If you 
20110129003555.000|20110129003557.000|TR0|look back in the Bush years when the U.S. 
20110129003557.000|20110129003600.000|TR0|was seen to be pushing this agenda 
20110129003600.000|20110129003603.000|TR0|aggressively, and they didn't trust the 
20110129003603.000|20110129003605.000|TR0|Americans' intention.  The U.S. was doing 
20110129003605.000|20110129003608.000|TR0|things they didn't like on the 
20110129003608.000|20110129003611.000|TR0|Arab/Israeli issue, on the Iraq issue, 
20110129003611.000|20110129003613.000|TR0|then it tainted the genuine democracy 
20110129003613.000|20110129003616.000|TR0|advocates.
20110129003616.000|20110129003619.000|TR0|
20110129003619.000|20110129003622.000|TR0|So I think the administration, number one, 
20110129003622.000|20110129003624.000|TR0|has to stand obviously on the side of the 
20110129003624.000|20110129003627.000|TR0|people and the freedoms that they are 
20110129003627.000|20110129003630.000|TR0|calling for. But stay as much as you can 
20110129003630.000|20110129003632.000|TR0|out of it.  Don't make America part of 
20110129003632.000|20110129003635.000|TR0|this.  This is not about America.  And 
20110129003635.000|20110129003638.000|TR0|what we see is there is no sloganeering.  
20110129003638.000|20110129003640.000|TR0|This is not an ideological revolt.  There 
20110129003640.000|20110129003643.000|TR0|are various segments of society.  This 
20110129003643.000|20110129003646.000|TR0|isn't the Muslim Brotherhood spearheading 
20110129003646.000|20110129003649.000|TR0|this.  That makes it more effective, 
20110129003649.000|20110129003651.000|TR0|because governments don't know how to say, 
20110129003651.000|20110129003654.000|TR0|you know, this is responsible.
20110129003654.000|20110129003657.000|TR0|
20110129003657.000|20110129003659.000|TR0|We've heard President Mubarak, tonight, 
20110129003659.000|20110129003702.000|TR0|say there is a plot.  But it is very hard 
20110129003702.000|20110129003705.000|TR0|to point to say who is behind this plot, 
20110129003705.000|20110129003707.000|TR0|because obviously, if you look at the 
20110129003707.000|20110129003710.000|TR0|make-up of the people on the streets, they 
20110129003710.000|20110129003713.000|TR0|are from all walks of life.  From left to 
20110129003713.000|20110129003715.000|TR0|right, Christian, Muslim, secular and 
20110129003715.000|20110129003718.000|TR0|religious; and therefore, it is very hard 
20110129003718.000|20110129003721.000|TR0|for them to make the argument this is not 
20110129003721.000|20110129003724.000|TR0|an indigenous expression of a vast segment 
20110129003724.000|20110129003726.000|TR0|of the Egyptian people.

20110129003812.000|20110129003815.000|TR0|here in Washington.  After a day of 
20110129003815.000|20110129003817.000|TR0|clashes between protesters and police in 
20110129003817.000|20110129003820.000|TR0|cities across Egypt, the Egyptian 
20110129003820.000|20110129003823.000|TR0|President Hosni Mubarak went on national 
20110129003823.000|20110129003826.000|TR0|television and defiantly tried to quiet 
20110129003826.000|20110129003828.000|TR0|this political crisis.

20110129003842.000|20110129003844.000|TR0|the security of this country and the 
20110129003844.000|20110129003847.000|TR0|citizens.  I will not let this happen.  I 
20110129003847.000|20110129003850.000|TR0|will not let fear to live in the citizens,

20110129003903.000|20110129003906.000|TR0|KING:  After that speech, President Obama 
20110129003906.000|20110129003909.000|TR0|reached out to the Egyptian leader and 
20110129003909.000|20110129003911.000|TR0|then President Obama made a statement at 
20110129003911.000|20110129003914.000|TR0|the White House.  He made it clear the 
20110129003914.000|20110129003917.000|TR0|Egyptian leader had not gone far enough.  
20110129003917.000|20110129003919.000|TR0|He called on Egypt's government to show 
20110129003919.000|20110129003922.000|TR0|restraint for the protestors.

20110129003930.000|20110129003933.000|TR0|OBAMA: As the situation continues to 
20110129003933.000|20110129003936.000|TR0|unfold, our first concern is preventing 
20110129003936.000|20110129003938.000|TR0|injury or loss of life.  So I want to be 
20110129003938.000|20110129003941.000|TR0|very clear in calling upon the Egyptian 
20110129003941.000|20110129003944.000|TR0|authorities to refrain from any violence 
20110129003944.000|20110129003946.000|TR0|against peaceful protesters.  The people 
20110129003946.000|20110129003949.000|TR0|of Egypt have rights that are universal.  
20110129003949.000|20110129003952.000|TR0|That includes the right to peaceful 
20110129003952.000|20110129003954.000|TR0|assembly, and association; the right to 
20110129003954.000|20110129003957.000|TR0|free speech, and the ability to determine 
20110129003957.000|20110129004000.000|TR0|their own destiny.  These are human rights 
20110129004000.000|20110129004003.000|TR0|and the United States will stand up for 
20110129004003.000|20110129004005.000|TR0|them everywhere.

20110129004019.000|20110129004021.000|TR0|Mubarak had only strengthened the resolve 
20110129004021.000|20110129004024.000|TR0|of his critics.  A short time ago I spoke 
20110129004024.000|20110129004027.000|TR0|to our Fareed Zakaria and asked him what

20110129004056.000|20110129004059.000|TR0|President Mubarak told his people was, in

20110129004102.000|20110129004105.000|TR0|conciliatory and highly disappointing.  
20110129004105.000|20110129004107.000|TR0|Then the official went on to say, but what

20110129004118.000|20110129004121.000|TR0|President Mubarak had a golden opportunity 
20110129004121.000|20110129004123.000|TR0|to get out in front of this, to make some 
20110129004123.000|20110129004126.000|TR0|kind of political process work, that would 
20110129004126.000|20110129004129.000|TR0|have given people a sense that there was 
20110129004129.000|20110129004132.000|TR0|evolution, not revolution in Egypt.  That 
20110129004132.000|20110129004134.000|TR0|there was a political evolution that would 
20110129004134.000|20110129004137.000|TR0|provide for a more democratic or more 
20110129004137.000|20110129004140.000|TR0|constitutional, a more law- abiding 
20110129004140.000|20110129004142.000|TR0|government, that would take into account 
20110129004142.000|20110129004145.000|TR0|the interests of the people.
20110129004145.000|20110129004148.000|TR0|
20110129004148.000|20110129004150.000|TR0|Instead, he decided to say, trust me.  I 
20110129004150.000|20110129004153.000|TR0|hear you.  I'm going to get rid of this 
20110129004153.000|20110129004156.000|TR0|government.  I'm going to put in another 
20110129004156.000|20110129004158.000|TR0|government. Of course, the problem is the 
20110129004158.000|20110129004201.000|TR0|people didn't really dislike the 
20110129004201.000|20110129004204.000|TR0|government, that is, his cabinet.  They 
20110129004204.000|20110129004207.000|TR0|dislike him.  They want action taken 
20110129004207.000|20110129004209.000|TR0|against him and his 28-year-old rule and 
20110129004209.000|20110129004212.000|TR0|30 years of martial law.  So it was very 
20110129004212.000|20110129004215.000|TR0|disappointing.  In some ways 
20110129004215.000|20110129004217.000|TR0|characteristic of dictatorships, it is 
20110129004217.000|20110129004220.000|TR0|very difficult to give up powerful, very 
20110129004220.000|20110129004223.000|TR0|difficult to see the writing on the wall.
20110129004223.000|20110129004225.000|TR0|
20110129004225.000|20110129004228.000|TR0|My guess is that while in the short term, 
20110129004228.000|20110129004231.000|TR0|the Egyptian army might be able to 
20110129004231.000|20110129004234.000|TR0|prevail, in the long run, this is the 
20110129004234.000|20110129004236.000|TR0|beginning of the end.
20110129004236.000|20110129004239.000|TR0|
20110129004239.000|20110129004242.000|TR0|KING:  You stay beginning of the end.  
20110129004242.000|20110129004244.000|TR0|Because if you look at this, President 
20110129004244.000|20110129004247.000|TR0|Mubarak has had some unrest before, but 
20110129004247.000|20110129004250.000|TR0|nothing even close to this scale.  Yet he 
20110129004250.000|20110129004252.000|TR0|seem to portray tonight that he can put 
20110129004252.000|20110129004255.000|TR0|the genie back in the bottle.
20110129004255.000|20110129004258.000|TR0|
20110129004258.000|20110129004300.000|TR0|ZAKARIA:  You know, you're right.  He has 
20110129004300.000|20110129004303.000|TR0|put it back in the bottle many times.  
20110129004303.000|20110129004306.000|TR0|He's had many kinds of protests, revolts 
20110129004306.000|20110129004309.000|TR0|through his terms in office.  We're in a 
20110129004309.000|20110129004311.000|TR0|different world.  There are two or three 
20110129004311.000|20110129004314.000|TR0|things that are new.  The first is--this 
20110129004314.000|20110129004317.000|TR0|is his own fault -- He unleashed a set of 
20110129004317.000|20110129004319.000|TR0|economic reforms in Egypt.  Egypt has been 
20110129004319.000|20110129004322.000|TR0|growing over the last five years.  It grew 
20110129004322.000|20110129004325.000|TR0|6.5 percent last year, so you have a 
20110129004325.000|20110129004327.000|TR0|middle class, you have restlessness, you 
20110129004327.000|20110129004330.000|TR0|have people who feel like they deserve 
20110129004330.000|20110129004333.000|TR0|rights.
20110129004333.000|20110129004336.000|TR0|
20110129004336.000|20110129004338.000|TR0|The next thing that has been going on is, 
20110129004338.000|20110129004341.000|TR0|of course, this extraordinary cable 
20110129004341.000|20110129004344.000|TR0|television, Internet, satellite 
20110129004344.000|20110129004346.000|TR0|revolution.  Al Jazeera, Twitter, Facebook 
20110129004346.000|20110129004349.000|TR0|and a hundred things like it; and finally, 
20110129004349.000|20110129004352.000|TR0|of course, the Tunisian revolution.  So 
20110129004352.000|20110129004354.000|TR0|all these things happened and provided a 
20110129004354.000|20110129004357.000|TR0|golden opportunity in Egypt for a middle 
20110129004357.000|20110129004400.000|TR0|class that was restive.  That had felt as 
20110129004400.000|20110129004402.000|TR0|though it need to be heard.  And Mubarak 
20110129004402.000|20110129004405.000|TR0|did not hear them.  It was a sad moment, 
20110129004405.000|20110129004408.000|TR0|because he had a chance.  He had a chance 
20110129004408.000|20110129004411.000|TR0|a year ago when he could have made clear 
20110129004411.000|20110129004413.000|TR0|he was not going to run for election as an 
20110129004413.000|20110129004416.000|TR0|82-year-old man, running after 28 years in 
20110129004416.000|20110129004419.000|TR0|office.  He would have signaled this was 
20110129004419.000|20110129004421.000|TR0|the beginning of change in Egypt.  That's 
20110129004421.000|20110129004424.000|TR0|really what people want in Egypt, my sense 
20110129004424.000|20110129004427.000|TR0|is, not revolution, not a revolt, but just 
20110129004427.000|20110129004429.000|TR0|change.  And he doesn't seem to be 
20110129004429.000|20110129004432.000|TR0|promising change.
20110129004432.000|20110129004435.000|TR0|
20110129004435.000|20110129004438.000|TR0|So given Egypt's historic role in the Arab 
20110129004438.000|20110129004440.000|TR0|and Muslim world, the cradle, if you will, 
20110129004440.000|20110129004443.000|TR0|the beacon, the largest country, what is 
20110129004443.000|20110129004446.000|TR0|the calculation now going on in Riyadh, 
20110129004446.000|20110129004448.000|TR0|and in Jordan, and in other Arab capitals, 
20110129004448.000|20110129004451.000|TR0|as they watch this unfold?  It has to be a 
20110129004451.000|20110129004454.000|TR0|great sense of trepidation.
20110129004454.000|20110129004456.000|TR0|
20110129004456.000|20110129004459.000|TR0|There are a lot of Arab diplomats here in 
20110129004459.000|20110129004502.000|TR0|Davos and I've spoken to most of them.  
20110129004502.000|20110129004504.000|TR0|There is an enormous amount of 
20110129004504.000|20110129004507.000|TR0|trepidation.  Many of them will tell that 
20110129004507.000|20110129004510.000|TR0|you that their countries are different.  
20110129004510.000|20110129004513.000|TR0|But I wouldn't believe them.  Because you 
20110129004513.000|20110129004515.000|TR0|know what?  Two week ago Egypt looked 
20110129004515.000|20110129004518.000|TR0|different.  The truth of the matter is 
20110129004518.000|20110129004521.000|TR0|that this is a virus that is unleashed.  
20110129004521.000|20110129004523.000|TR0|It may not spread everywhere.
20110129004523.000|20110129004526.000|TR0|
20110129004526.000|20110129004529.000|TR0|As I say, it is interesting to note that 
20110129004529.000|20110129004531.000|TR0|Egypt and Tunisia were the two non-oil 
20110129004531.000|20110129004534.000|TR0|producing Arab countries that had been 
20110129004534.000|20110129004537.000|TR0|growing economically.  That had been 
20110129004537.000|20110129004539.000|TR0|modernizing their economies.  In a strange 
20110129004539.000|20110129004542.000|TR0|sense, the more stagnant ones, like Syria, 
20110129004542.000|20110129004545.000|TR0|have been spared some of this contagion of 
20110129004545.000|20110129004548.000|TR0|middle class restlessness.  But everywhere 
20110129004548.000|20110129004550.000|TR0|they're looking at it.  And everywhere 
20110129004550.000|20110129004553.000|TR0|they're wondering what their people are 
20110129004553.000|20110129004556.000|TR0|making of it.
20110129004556.000|20110129004558.000|TR0|
20110129004558.000|20110129004601.000|TR0|The point you began with is very 
20110129004601.000|20110129004604.000|TR0|important.  Egypt is the cultural heart of 
20110129004604.000|20110129004606.000|TR0|the Arab world.  It is historically been 
20110129004606.000|20110129004609.000|TR0|the heart and soul of the Arab world.  It 
20110129004609.000|20110129004612.000|TR0|is where Arab nationalism comes from with 
20110129004612.000|20110129004615.000|TR0|Nasser in the 1950s.  Egyptian films, 
20110129004615.000|20110129004617.000|TR0|songs, television shows dominate the Arab 
20110129004617.000|20110129004620.000|TR0|world.  If Egypt goes, it will be a very, 
20110129004620.000|20110129004623.000|TR0|very big fall.
20110129004623.000|20110129004625.000|TR0|
20110129004625.000|20110129004628.000|TR0|KING:  And if Egypt goes, if Egypt is 
20110129004628.000|20110129004631.000|TR0|unstable, Fareed, does anybody in the 
20110129004631.000|20110129004633.000|TR0|region win?  Many would say maybe Iran is 
20110129004633.000|20110129004636.000|TR0|not unhappy to see Egypt in turmoil and a 
20110129004636.000|20110129004639.000|TR0|key ally of the United States at this 
20110129004639.000|20110129004641.000|TR0|moment of crisis.
20110129004641.000|20110129004644.000|TR0|
20110129004644.000|20110129004647.000|TR0|ZAKARIA:  I would suspect that it would 
20110129004647.000|20110129004650.000|TR0|take a lot to turn Egypt into real chaos 
20110129004650.000|20110129004652.000|TR0|and crisis.  Egypt is the oldest state in 
20110129004652.000|20110129004655.000|TR0|the Arab world.  It is one of the oldest 
20110129004655.000|20110129004658.000|TR0|states in the world.  Egypt is one of the 
20110129004658.000|20110129004700.000|TR0|few states in the world, Egypt, Iran, that 
20110129004700.000|20110129004703.000|TR0|have continuous borders from I don't know, 
20110129004703.000|20110129004706.000|TR0|5,000 B.C.  It is an old state.  This is 
20110129004706.000|20110129004708.000|TR0|the pharaoh state, and old administration, 
20110129004708.000|20110129004711.000|TR0|a respected army.  So even if you have 
20110129004711.000|20110129004714.000|TR0|change in Egypt, don't be surprised a year 
20110129004714.000|20110129004717.000|TR0|or two later the same bureaucrats are 
20110129004717.000|20110129004719.000|TR0|running a lot of what's going on in Egypt. 
20110129004719.000|20110129004722.000|TR0| I don't think you will have the kind of 
20110129004722.000|20110129004725.000|TR0|chaos that people fear.  You may have a 
20110129004725.000|20110129004727.000|TR0|different government, it may have populist 
20110129004727.000|20110129004730.000|TR0|tendencies, it may have Islamist 
20110129004730.000|20110129004733.000|TR0|tendencies, but I don't think it will be 
20110129004733.000|20110129004735.000|TR0|the massive revolution you saw in Iran in 
20110129004735.000|20110129004738.000|TR0|the 1970s.
20110129004738.000|20110129004741.000|TR0|
20110129004741.000|20110129004743.000|TR0|KING:  Fareed Zakaria, as always, 
20110129004743.000|20110129004746.000|TR0|appreciate your insights.
20110129004746.000|20110129004749.000|TR0|
20110129004749.000|20110129004752.000|TR0|ZAKARIA:  Pleasure, John.
20110129004752.000|20110129004754.000|TR0|
20110129004754.000|20110129004757.000|TR0|KING:  You're looking at live pictures.  
20110129004757.000|20110129004800.000|TR0|These are feeding in live to us, from our 
20110129004800.000|20110129004802.000|TR0|Cairo bureau.  A military tank on the 
20110129004802.000|20110129004805.000|TR0|streets just outside; you see people 
20110129004805.000|20110129004808.000|TR0|milling on the streets as well.

20110129004810.000|20110129004813.000|TR0|It is coming up on 3:00 o'clock in the 
20110129004813.000|20110129004816.000|TR0|morning Saturday.  A peaceful scene at the 
20110129004816.000|20110129004819.000|TR0|moment, but some people walking on the 
20110129004819.000|20110129004821.000|TR0|street, especially, you see them on the 
20110129004821.000|20110129004824.000|TR0|top there again.  We haven't seen this 
20110129004824.000|20110129004827.000|TR0|before, military vehicles lining the 
20110129004827.000|20110129004829.000|TR0|street.  This is outside CNN's Cairo 
20110129004829.000|20110129004832.000|TR0|bureau.  When we come back we will go to 
20110129004832.000|20110129004835.000|TR0|our Ben Wedeman.  He is right there on the 
20110129004835.000|20110129004837.000|TR0|scene.  We'll also check in live at the 
20110129004837.000|20110129004840.000|TR0|White House .

20110129004843.000|20110129004845.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110129004845.000|20110129004848.000|TR0|
20110129004848.000|20110129004851.000|TR0|KING:  Let's go straight to our Senior 
20110129004851.000|20110129004854.000|TR0|International Correspondent Ben Wedeman.  
20110129004854.000|20110129004856.000|TR0|He is in Cairo watching this drama unfold.
20110129004856.000|20110129004859.000|TR0|
20110129004859.000|20110129004902.000|TR0|Ben, the president gave his speech.  He 
20110129004902.000|20110129004904.000|TR0|sounded defiant and by all accounts, the 
20110129004904.000|20110129004907.000|TR0|protesters are not satisfied.  Is that 
20110129004907.000|20110129004910.000|TR0|correct?
20110129004910.000|20110129004912.000|TR0|
20110129004912.000|20110129004915.000|TR0|BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INT'L. CORRESPONDENT: 
20110129004915.000|20110129004918.000|TR0| Yes.  Not satisfied at all, John.  What 
20110129004918.000|20110129004921.000|TR0|we saw is almost immediately after that 
20110129004921.000|20110129004923.000|TR0|speech, which was televised on live TV, 
20110129004923.000|20110129004926.000|TR0|more protests coming out.  They're not 
20110129004926.000|20110129004929.000|TR0|violent so far.  And I can tell you right 
20110129004929.000|20110129004931.000|TR0|now, four army tanks and at least as many 
20110129004931.000|20110129004934.000|TR0|armored personnel carriers have just 
20110129004934.000|20110129004937.000|TR0|pulled up outside our building.  And this 
20110129004937.000|20110129004939.000|TR0|actually has been to the satisfaction of 
20110129004939.000|20110129004942.000|TR0|many Egyptians.  Because the worry is that 
20110129004942.000|20110129004945.000|TR0|the police have seemed to have completely 
20110129004945.000|20110129004947.000|TR0|disappeared.  With them gone, there is the 
20110129004947.000|20110129004950.000|TR0|specter of real chaos.
20110129004950.000|20110129004953.000|TR0|
20110129004953.000|20110129004956.000|TR0|It was interesting.  We were watching as 
20110129004956.000|20110129004958.000|TR0|the police station right behind our 
20110129004958.000|20110129005001.000|TR0|building was attacked by the protesters.  
20110129005001.000|20110129005004.000|TR0|All of the police had put on civilian 
20110129005004.000|20110129005006.000|TR0|clothing and ran away.  And we're hearing 
20110129005006.000|20110129005009.000|TR0|reports of all the major police stations 
20110129005009.000|20110129005012.000|TR0|around Cairo have been sacked.  There is 
20110129005012.000|20110129005014.000|TR0|no longer a police forceful it is the army 
20110129005014.000|20110129005017.000|TR0|and the Republican Guard that seem to be 
20110129005017.000|20110129005020.000|TR0|on control of the streets, John.
20110129005020.000|20110129005022.000|TR0|
20110129005022.000|20110129005025.000|TR0|KING:  And Ben, if it is the army now that 
20110129005025.000|20110129005028.000|TR0|is the key barrier, if you will, when you 
20110129005028.000|20110129005031.000|TR0|have civil demonstrations in the morning, 
20110129005031.000|20110129005033.000|TR0|is that when we will learn how the army 
20110129005033.000|20110129005036.000|TR0|will react?  Whether the army will be 
20110129005036.000|20110129005039.000|TR0|aggressive in its response?  And I assume 
20110129005039.000|20110129005041.000|TR0|the next 24 to 48 hours whether we are 
20110129005041.000|20110129005044.000|TR0|truly at a tipping point when it comes to 
20110129005044.000|20110129005047.000|TR0|President Mubarak?
20110129005047.000|20110129005049.000|TR0|
20110129005049.000|20110129005052.000|TR0|WEDEMAN:  A tipping point indeed, John.  
20110129005052.000|20110129005055.000|TR0|The army so far seems to be very 
20110129005055.000|20110129005058.000|TR0|restrained.  Very hesitant to use the sort 
20110129005058.000|20110129005100.000|TR0|of violence that the police did quite 
20110129005100.000|20110129005103.000|TR0|liberally against the people.  And that 
20110129005103.000|20110129005106.000|TR0|may be the critical point.  People are not 
20110129005106.000|20110129005108.000|TR0|going to be satisfied with this speech the 
20110129005108.000|20110129005111.000|TR0|president made.  In fact, that was a 
20110129005111.000|20110129005114.000|TR0|speech many thought he would make very 
20110129005114.000|20110129005116.000|TR0|early on in the protests.  Most people say 
20110129005116.000|20110129005119.000|TR0|the formation of a government is just too 
20110129005119.000|20110129005122.000|TR0|little, too late.  And they are definitely 
20110129005122.000|20110129005124.000|TR0|looking at the army to somehow help this 
20110129005124.000|20110129005127.000|TR0|country muddle through this current 
20110129005127.000|20110129005130.000|TR0|crisis, John.
20110129005130.000|20110129005133.000|TR0|
20110129005133.000|20110129005135.000|TR0|KING:  Ben Wedeman in Cairo, part of our 
20110129005135.000|20110129005138.000|TR0|remarkable team inside the country.  Ben, 
20110129005138.000|20110129005141.000|TR0|thank you for your exhaustive work.  We'll 
20110129005141.000|20110129005143.000|TR0|keep in touch in the key hours ahead, the 
20110129005143.000|20110129005146.000|TR0|key hours ahead.
20110129005146.000|20110129005149.000|TR0|
20110129005149.000|20110129005151.000|TR0|Let's check in now with the White House.  
20110129005151.000|20110129005154.000|TR0|The president of the United States, after 
20110129005154.000|20110129005157.000|TR0|President Mubarak's nationally televised 
20110129005157.000|20110129005200.000|TR0|address. You just heard Ben talking about 
20110129005200.000|20110129005202.000|TR0|that.  President Obama called him, made 
20110129005202.000|20110129005205.000|TR0|clear he wanted a bit more from the 
20110129005205.000|20110129005208.000|TR0|Egyptian president.  Wanted more of an 
20110129005208.000|20110129005210.000|TR0|open dialogue with the demonstrators.  
20110129005210.000|20110129005213.000|TR0|Then the president of the United States 
20110129005213.000|20110129005216.000|TR0|spoke to the American people and said this.
20110129005216.000|20110129005218.000|TR0|

20110129005221.000|20110129005224.000|TR0|
20110129005224.000|20110129005226.000|TR0|OBAMA:  President Mubarak addressed the 
20110129005226.000|20110129005229.000|TR0|Egyptian people tonight. He pledged a 
20110129005229.000|20110129005232.000|TR0|better democracy and greater economic 
20110129005232.000|20110129005235.000|TR0|opportunity.  I just spoke to him after 
20110129005235.000|20110129005237.000|TR0|his speech.  And I told him he has a 
20110129005237.000|20110129005240.000|TR0|responsibility to give meaning to those 
20110129005240.000|20110129005243.000|TR0|words.  To take concrete steps and actions 
20110129005243.000|20110129005245.000|TR0|that deliver on that promise.
20110129005245.000|20110129005248.000|TR0|

20110129005253.000|20110129005256.000|TR0|KING:  Our White House Correspondent Dan 
20110129005256.000|20110129005259.000|TR0|Lothian is with us.
20110129005259.000|20110129005302.000|TR0|
20110129005302.000|20110129005304.000|TR0|And, Dan, I know the president's team will 
20110129005304.000|20110129005307.000|TR0|track the key daylight hours tomorrow.  
20110129005307.000|20110129005310.000|TR0|What are the concrete steps the president 
20110129005310.000|20110129005312.000|TR0|wants to see and see soon?

20110129005315.000|20110129005318.000|TR0|DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE 
20110129005318.000|20110129005320.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's something 
20110129005320.000|20110129005323.000|TR0|that will develop over the next few days.  
20110129005323.000|20110129005326.000|TR0|The administration will be keeping a close 
20110129005326.000|20110129005328.000|TR0|eye on whether or not the government 
20110129005328.000|20110129005331.000|TR0|responds to this warning, if you will, 
20110129005331.000|20110129005334.000|TR0|from the U.S. whether or not the security 
20110129005334.000|20110129005337.000|TR0|forces and the police forces continue to 
20110129005337.000|20110129005339.000|TR0|crack down on protesters there in Egypt.
20110129005339.000|20110129005342.000|TR0|
20110129005342.000|20110129005345.000|TR0|And one of the things an administration 
20110129005345.000|20110129005347.000|TR0|official said the White House will 
20110129005347.000|20110129005350.000|TR0|continue reviewing is the assistance that 
20110129005350.000|20110129005353.000|TR0|the U.S. gives to Egypt, including more 
20110129005353.000|20110129005355.000|TR0|than a billion dollars each year.  They 
20110129005355.000|20110129005358.000|TR0|will watch the progress and how the 
20110129005358.000|20110129005401.000|TR0|government in Egypt deals with the unrest 
20110129005401.000|20110129005404.000|TR0|on the ground.  And that could impact the 
20110129005404.000|20110129005406.000|TR0|aid going forward to Egypt, John?
20110129005406.000|20110129005409.000|TR0|
20110129005409.000|20110129005412.000|TR0|KING:  Dan, I assume we could hear from 
20110129005412.000|20110129005414.000|TR0|the president again tomorrow, or at least 
20110129005414.000|20110129005417.000|TR0|someone at the White House.  The National 
20110129005417.000|20110129005420.000|TR0|Security team will watch this play out.
20110129005420.000|20110129005422.000|TR0|
20110129005422.000|20110129005425.000|TR0|LOTHIAN:  They'll be watching it very 
20110129005425.000|20110129005428.000|TR0|closely.  Perhaps we'll hear from the 
20110129005428.000|20110129005430.000|TR0|president.  We're told that he continues 
20110129005430.000|20110129005433.000|TR0|to get up to the minute information on the 
20110129005433.000|20110129005436.000|TR0|situation on the ground in Egypt.  He got 
20110129005436.000|20110129005439.000|TR0|an early morning memo from his national 
20110129005439.000|20110129005441.000|TR0|security adviser, and then that typical 
20110129005441.000|20110129005444.000|TR0|daily briefing that the president gets 
20110129005444.000|20110129005447.000|TR0|that touches on a whole host of issues, 
20110129005447.000|20110129005449.000|TR0|national security issues, domestic and 
20110129005449.000|20110129005452.000|TR0|international as well.  Today focused 
20110129005452.000|20110129005455.000|TR0|solely on Egypt.  That meeting lasting for 
20110129005455.000|20110129005457.000|TR0|about 40 minutes.  The president will 
20110129005457.000|20110129005500.000|TR0|continue to get that kind of information 
20110129005500.000|20110129005503.000|TR0|going forward as well, John.
20110129005503.000|20110129005505.000|TR0|
20110129005505.000|20110129005508.000|TR0|KING:  Dan Lothian at the White House.  
20110129005508.000|20110129005511.000|TR0|Dan, appreciate it.
20110129005511.000|20110129005514.000|TR0|
20110129005514.000|20110129005516.000|TR0|Still with us is Professor Shibley 
20110129005516.000|20110129005519.000|TR0|Telhami, who knows this region 
20110129005519.000|20110129005522.000|TR0|extraordinarily well.  I want to come over 
20110129005522.000|20110129005524.000|TR0|to the wall a minute and talk about the 
20110129005524.000|20110129005527.000|TR0|value of the Internet.  The importance of 
20110129005527.000|20110129005530.000|TR0|the Internet in communicating and 
20110129005530.000|20110129005532.000|TR0|organizing, but first to Ben Wedeman's 
20110129005532.000|20110129005535.000|TR0|point about the restraint of the army so 
20110129005535.000|20110129005538.000|TR0|far.  He's seen that in Cairo, our Nic 
20110129005538.000|20110129005541.000|TR0|Robertson just sent out a Tweet from 
20110129005541.000|20110129005543.000|TR0|Alexandria, saying there were people 
20110129005543.000|20110129005546.000|TR0|looting, they burned a police station, and 
20110129005546.000|20110129005549.000|TR0|the army was staying back from that.  How 
20110129005549.000|20110129005551.000|TR0|important is the army in the next 12 to 24 
20110129005551.000|20110129005554.000|TR0|hours?
20110129005554.000|20110129005557.000|TR0|
20110129005557.000|20110129005559.000|TR0|TELHAMI:  Central.  The army is the anchor 
20110129005559.000|20110129005602.000|TR0|of this regime.  This is, of course, a 
20110129005602.000|20110129005605.000|TR0|regime that was born out of a coup that 
20110129005605.000|20110129005607.000|TR0|was popular, that was called the 
20110129005607.000|20110129005610.000|TR0|Revolution 1952.  What it does is very 
20110129005610.000|20110129005613.000|TR0|important for the regime.  They have a 
20110129005613.000|20110129005616.000|TR0|good reputation in the Egyptian public. 
20110129005616.000|20110129005618.000|TR0|They receive them well.  It seemed to be 
20110129005618.000|20110129005621.000|TR0|professional.  But if they start going 
20110129005621.000|20110129005624.000|TR0|against the public, it is going to change 
20110129005624.000|20110129005626.000|TR0|the picture. And what we've seen today is 
20110129005626.000|20110129005629.000|TR0|the security services were overwhelmed. 
20110129005629.000|20110129005632.000|TR0|They are not going to be able to keep the 
20110129005632.000|20110129005634.000|TR0|kind of order that the government wants.  
20110129005634.000|20110129005637.000|TR0|And it's going to be up to the army.  And 
20110129005637.000|20110129005640.000|TR0|if they do, do it by force, then they are 
20110129005640.000|20110129005643.000|TR0|going to change the whole structure. They 
20110129005643.000|20110129005645.000|TR0|want to keep the reputation for the 
20110129005645.000|20110129005648.000|TR0|future.  They can't afford that.  So 
20110129005648.000|20110129005651.000|TR0|they'll be in the --     (CROSS TALK)
20110129005651.000|20110129005653.000|TR0|
20110129005653.000|20110129005656.000|TR0|KING:  So then if the people are in the 
20110129005656.000|20110129005659.000|TR0|streets and the army does not act 
20110129005659.000|20110129005701.000|TR0|aggressively, is that a message from the 
20110129005701.000|20110129005704.000|TR0|army to President Mubarak?
20110129005704.000|20110129005707.000|TR0|
20110129005707.000|20110129005709.000|TR0|TELHAMI:  Well in the short term, we don't 
20110129005709.000|20110129005712.000|TR0|know yet because there has not been a 
20110129005712.000|20110129005715.000|TR0|major challenge.  Obviously if the curfews 
20110129005715.000|20110129005718.000|TR0|continue and then people pour into the 
20110129005718.000|20110129005720.000|TR0|streets, even if peacefully, and the army 
20110129005720.000|20110129005723.000|TR0|sits back, it's going to be a problem.  
20110129005723.000|20110129005726.000|TR0|Somebody is going to have to enforce it.  
20110129005726.000|20110129005728.000|TR0|But I don't think-at this point, the upper 
20110129005728.000|20110129005731.000|TR0|echelons of the army are loyal to the 
20110129005731.000|20110129005734.000|TR0|president.  The part of the regime, the 
20110129005734.000|20110129005736.000|TR0|officers are professional.  The rank and 
20110129005736.000|20110129005739.000|TR0|file with the people, they come from the 
20110129005739.000|20110129005742.000|TR0|people.  And we don't know yet how they 
20110129005742.000|20110129005745.000|TR0|will behave if, in fact, there's 
20110129005745.000|20110129005747.000|TR0|confrontation.

20110129005822.000|20110129005825.000|TR0|KING:  Here in the United States, we take 
20110129005825.000|20110129005828.000|TR0|our right to free speech and our right for

20110129005830.000|20110129005833.000|TR0|granted. In Egypt, an authoritarian regime 
20110129005833.000|20110129005836.000|TR0|has stifled the opposition.  It jails its 
20110129005836.000|20110129005838.000|TR0|critics, which makes what we've seen in
