20110114000007.000|20110114000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR:  Thanks Wolf and 
20110114000009.000|20110114000011.000|TR0|good evening everyone.  A lot of breaking 
20110114000011.000|20110114000014.000|TR0|news tonight including talk of a miracle 
20110114000014.000|20110114000016.000|TR0|in Tucson tonight, also word a missing 
20110114000016.000|20110114000019.000|TR0|piece of evidence is now in police hands 
20110114000019.000|20110114000021.000|TR0|and there is pain.  One family's numbing 
20110114000021.000|20110114000024.000|TR0|loss has in many ways become the unifying 
20110114000024.000|20110114000026.000|TR0|symbol of Tucson's and America's tragedy.  
20110114000026.000|20110114000029.000|TR0|There was a funeral mass for 9-year-old 
20110114000029.000|20110114000031.000|TR0|Christina Taylor Green today.
20110114000031.000|20110114000034.000|TR0|
20110114000034.000|20110114000036.000|TR0|She was born on 9/11 and a giant flag 
20110114000036.000|20110114000039.000|TR0|recovered from ground zero was lifted in a 
20110114000039.000|20110114000041.000|TR0|make shift arch outside the family's 
20110114000041.000|20110114000044.000|TR0|church.  More on Christina in a moment 
20110114000044.000|20110114000046.000|TR0|including a conversation with the New York 
20110114000046.000|20110114000049.000|TR0|City firefighter who carried the historic 
20110114000049.000|20110114000051.000|TR0|flag to Tucson and some spent time 
20110114000051.000|20110114000054.000|TR0|tonight's with the girl's grieving parents.
20110114000054.000|20110114000056.000|TR0|
20110114000056.000|20110114000059.000|TR0|There are also important developments in 
20110114000059.000|20110114000101.000|TR0|the investigation including the discovery 
20110114000101.000|20110114000104.000|TR0|of a piece of evidence we told you last 
20110114000104.000|20110114000106.000|TR0|night was missing, a black bag suspected 
20110114000106.000|20110114000109.000|TR0|assassin Jared Lee Loughner had the 
20110114000109.000|20110114000111.000|TR0|morning of the massacre.  But first, our 
20110114000111.000|20110114000114.000|TR0|Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us after an 
20110114000114.000|20110114000116.000|TR0|exclusive day of access to the medical 
20110114000116.000|20110114000118.000|TR0|team treating Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110114000118.000|20110114000121.000|TR0|Giffords.
20110114000121.000|20110114000123.000|TR0|
20110114000123.000|20110114000126.000|TR0|It was another day of startling progress.  
20110114000126.000|20110114000128.000|TR0|She lifted both legs when asked to do so 
20110114000128.000|20110114000131.000|TR0|and the doctors are now accelerating her 
20110114000131.000|20110114000133.000|TR0|physical therapy.  Let's go straight to 
20110114000133.000|20110114000136.000|TR0|Dr. Gupta.  Doctor, before we get into the 
20110114000136.000|20110114000138.000|TR0|medical assessment, you also had a 
20110114000138.000|20110114000141.000|TR0|fascinating exclusive conversation, the 
20110114000141.000|20110114000143.000|TR0|first interview I'm aware of, with 
20110114000143.000|20110114000146.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords, the congresswoman's 
20110114000146.000|20110114000148.000|TR0|husband, Captain Mark Kelly.  What did he 
20110114000148.000|20110114000151.000|TR0|tell you?
20110114000151.000|20110114000153.000|TR0|
20110114000153.000|20110114000156.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL 
20110114000156.000|20110114000158.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know it was a 
20110114000158.000|20110114000201.000|TR0|fascinating discussion.  We talked for 
20110114000201.000|20110114000203.000|TR0|about 20 minutes. First of all, he did 
20110114000203.000|20110114000206.000|TR0|attend that memorial service, John that 
20110114000206.000|20110114000208.000|TR0|you were just talking about for Christina 
20110114000208.000|20110114000211.000|TR0|Green.  In fact I met him right as he 
20110114000211.000|20110114000213.000|TR0|returned from that memorial service.
20110114000213.000|20110114000216.000|TR0|
20110114000216.000|20110114000218.000|TR0|He talked about you know how he found out 
20110114000218.000|20110114000221.000|TR0|about what had happened to his wife.  He 
20110114000221.000|20110114000223.000|TR0|was in Houston at the time.  He got a call 
20110114000223.000|20110114000226.000|TR0|from Congressman Giffords chief of staff, 
20110114000226.000|20110114000228.000|TR0|Thea (ph), who told him what had happened, 
20110114000228.000|20110114000230.000|TR0|but just sort of rough idea, vague.  There 
20110114000230.000|20110114000233.000|TR0|had been no news reports of this at this 
20110114000233.000|20110114000235.000|TR0|point, so he, you know he was frankly 
20110114000235.000|20110114000238.000|TR0|finding it hard to believe being in 
20110114000238.000|20110114000240.000|TR0|Houston, being a pilot, an astronaut, in 
20110114000240.000|20110114000243.000|TR0|fact he wanted to get his way to Tucson as 
20110114000243.000|20110114000245.000|TR0|quickly as possible.
20110114000245.000|20110114000248.000|TR0|
20110114000248.000|20110114000250.000|TR0|Commercial flights would take too long.  
20110114000250.000|20110114000253.000|TR0|He was able to get some help from a friend 
20110114000253.000|20110114000255.000|TR0|on a private plane and got here within 45 
20110114000255.000|20110114000258.000|TR0|minutes. Right about the time now that his 
20110114000258.000|20110114000300.000|TR0|wife, Congresswoman Giffords, was coming 
20110114000300.000|20110114000303.000|TR0|out of the operating room and that was the 
20110114000303.000|20110114000305.000|TR0|first time that this all started to come 
20110114000305.000|20110114000308.000|TR0|to reality for him.  He met with two 
20110114000308.000|20110114000310.000|TR0|doctors, Doctor Rhee and Dr. Lemole.  
20110114000310.000|20110114000313.000|TR0|John, you've talked to both of them this 
20110114000313.000|20110114000315.000|TR0|week.
20110114000315.000|20110114000318.000|TR0|
20110114000318.000|20110114000320.000|TR0|They basically told him what had happened 
20110114000320.000|20110114000323.000|TR0|at that point and tried to paint a picture 
20110114000323.000|20110114000325.000|TR0|of what the next several hours and days 
20110114000325.000|20110114000328.000|TR0|would be like.  He talked a lot about last 
20110114000328.000|20110114000330.000|TR0|night, John, and the president of the 
20110114000330.000|20110114000333.000|TR0|United States visiting her.  And I asked 
20110114000333.000|20110114000335.000|TR0|Captain Kelly, I said did your wife know 
20110114000335.000|20110114000337.000|TR0|that the president was there visiting with 
20110114000337.000|20110114000340.000|TR0|her.  And he sort of paused for a second 
20110114000340.000|20110114000342.000|TR0|and he said, well, I think that she knew 
20110114000342.000|20110114000345.000|TR0|that the president was there, was in the 
20110114000345.000|20110114000347.000|TR0|room, but she wasn't quite sure why, which 
20110114000347.000|20110114000350.000|TR0|I thought was interesting and a very fair 
20110114000350.000|20110114000352.000|TR0|characterization probably of what is going 
20110114000352.000|20110114000355.000|TR0|on inside her mind right now.
20110114000355.000|20110114000357.000|TR0|
20110114000357.000|20110114000400.000|TR0|John, you know one thing that I learned 
20110114000400.000|20110114000402.000|TR0|today as well is that Congresswoman 
20110114000402.000|20110114000405.000|TR0|Giffords was brought to this hospital 
20110114000405.000|20110114000407.000|TR0|behind me by an ambulance, not by 
20110114000407.000|20110114000410.000|TR0|helicopter, brought by ambulance, which is 
20110114000410.000|20110114000412.000|TR0|actually considered to be faster than a 
20110114000412.000|20110114000415.000|TR0|helicopter given the distance of the 
20110114000415.000|20110114000417.000|TR0|Safeway from this hospital.  She did not 
20110114000417.000|20110114000420.000|TR0|have a breathing tube put in on site.  The 
20110114000420.000|20110114000422.000|TR0|adopted what's known as a scoop and run 
20110114000422.000|20110114000425.000|TR0|sort of philosophy, get her here as 
20110114000425.000|20110114000427.000|TR0|quickly as possible and that's what they 
20110114000427.000|20110114000430.000|TR0|did here.  Captain Kelly himself did not 
20110114000430.000|20110114000432.000|TR0|know that she had been brought by ground.  
20110114000432.000|20110114000435.000|TR0|He thought she had been brought by 
20110114000435.000|20110114000437.000|TR0|helicopter.  It just gives you an idea of 
20110114000437.000|20110114000440.000|TR0|how fluid the situation still is, John, in 
20110114000440.000|20110114000442.000|TR0|terms of getting information.
20110114000442.000|20110114000445.000|TR0|
20110114000445.000|20110114000447.000|TR0|KING:  I want to get to the medical 
20110114000447.000|20110114000449.000|TR0|details and your exclusive access to the 
20110114000449.000|20110114000452.000|TR0|medical team in a minute, but help me 
20110114000452.000|20110114000454.000|TR0|again -- help us all understand, you have 
20110114000454.000|20110114000457.000|TR0|this conversation with Captain Kelly, 
20110114000457.000|20110114000459.000|TR0|we've all been waiting to hear from him, 
20110114000459.000|20110114000502.000|TR0|this is obviously an incredible time of 
20110114000502.000|20110114000504.000|TR0|hardship for him, yet there has been this 
20110114000504.000|20110114000507.000|TR0|hope in recent days. And so he's in the 
20110114000507.000|20110114000509.000|TR0|room, her friends from Congress come in, 
20110114000509.000|20110114000512.000|TR0|and what does he take away from that?  I 
20110114000512.000|20110114000514.000|TR0|assume on the one hand he's incredibly 
20110114000514.000|20110114000517.000|TR0|excited but also a little bit of afraid to 
20110114000517.000|20110114000519.000|TR0|get too excited.
20110114000519.000|20110114000522.000|TR0|
20110114000522.000|20110114000524.000|TR0|GUPTA:  He's not the kind of guy that 
20110114000524.000|20110114000527.000|TR0|strikes me as somebody who would use the 
20110114000527.000|20110114000529.000|TR0|word miracle just off the cuff.  And you 
20110114000529.000|20110114000532.000|TR0|heard the word miracle being thrown around 
20110114000532.000|20110114000534.000|TR0|a lot last night.  And I'm not somebody 
20110114000534.000|20110114000537.000|TR0|who uses it off the cuff either, but I 
20110114000537.000|20110114000539.000|TR0|asked him specifically about that and he 
20110114000539.000|20110114000542.000|TR0|sort of got a little glimmer in his eyes 
20110114000542.000|20110114000544.000|TR0|and he said it was miraculous.
20110114000544.000|20110114000547.000|TR0|
20110114000547.000|20110114000549.000|TR0|I think he really believed it.  I'm not 
20110114000549.000|20110114000552.000|TR0|sure if he was referring to the timing of 
20110114000552.000|20110114000554.000|TR0|when she opened her eyes, being that the 
20110114000554.000|20110114000557.000|TR0|president was visiting right around that 
20110114000557.000|20110114000559.000|TR0|time and everything, but he really 
20110114000559.000|20110114000601.000|TR0|believes that she was opening her eyes, 
20110114000601.000|20110114000604.000|TR0|you know in some sort of recognition of 
20110114000604.000|20110114000606.000|TR0|all that was going on around her at that 
20110114000606.000|20110114000609.000|TR0|time.  You know he said that he met with 
20110114000609.000|20110114000611.000|TR0|Dr. Rhee and Dr. Lemole.  Dr. Rhee was, 
20110114000611.000|20110114000614.000|TR0|you know just straight to the facts.
20110114000614.000|20110114000616.000|TR0|
20110114000616.000|20110114000619.000|TR0|She's going to survive.  I'm confident of 
20110114000619.000|20110114000621.000|TR0|it.  And he said Dr. Lemole said look, you 
20110114000621.000|20110114000624.000|TR0|know we've got to be cautious here and I 
20110114000624.000|20110114000626.000|TR0|guarantee she's going to have some steps 
20110114000626.000|20110114000629.000|TR0|backwards over the next several days.  And 
20110114000629.000|20110114000631.000|TR0|then he looked at me and said she hasn't 
20110114000631.000|20110114000634.000|TR0|had any steps backwards yet.  So we're 
20110114000634.000|20110114000636.000|TR0|keeping our fingers crossed.  That's sort 
20110114000636.000|20110114000639.000|TR0|of his attitude and that's sort of his 
20110114000639.000|20110114000641.000|TR0|perception of things right now.  Still has 
20110114000641.000|20110114000644.000|TR0|the breathing tube in, but Captain Kelly 
20110114000644.000|20110114000646.000|TR0|said that could come out as early as 
20110114000646.000|20110114000649.000|TR0|tomorrow, could be a few more days, but 
20110114000649.000|20110114000651.000|TR0|he's optimistic that's happening as well 
20110114000651.000|20110114000654.000|TR0|soon.
20110114000654.000|20110114000656.000|TR0|
20110114000656.000|20110114000659.000|TR0|KING:  It's breathtaking.  Now, Dr. Gupta, 
20110114000659.000|20110114000701.000|TR0|this is what you do for a living and you 
20110114000701.000|20110114000704.000|TR0|were granted exclusive access to the 
20110114000704.000|20110114000706.000|TR0|trauma suite where she is being cared for, 
20110114000706.000|20110114000708.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords is being cared for 
20110114000708.000|20110114000711.000|TR0|today.  Tell us what the highlights of 
20110114000711.000|20110114000713.000|TR0|what you learned from Dr. Lemole and the 
20110114000713.000|20110114000716.000|TR0|others.
20110114000716.000|20110114000718.000|TR0|
20110114000718.000|20110114000721.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well you know Dr. Lemole in pretty 
20110114000721.000|20110114000723.000|TR0|great detail really talked about the 
20110114000723.000|20110114000726.000|TR0|specifics of this operation and you know 
20110114000726.000|20110114000728.000|TR0|we talked a little bit about that, but he 
20110114000728.000|20110114000731.000|TR0|really showed some of exactly what he did 
20110114000731.000|20110114000733.000|TR0|to try and make sure she had no pressure 
20110114000733.000|20110114000736.000|TR0|on her brain.  John, it's called a 
20110114000736.000|20110114000738.000|TR0|decompressive hemicranectomy.  You don't 
20110114000738.000|20110114000741.000|TR0|need to remember that name, but here's the 
20110114000741.000|20110114000743.000|TR0|point.
20110114000743.000|20110114000746.000|TR0|
20110114000746.000|20110114000748.000|TR0|You take off almost half the skull on the 
20110114000748.000|20110114000751.000|TR0|head and the point is to provide a lot of 
20110114000751.000|20110114000753.000|TR0|room for the brain to swell.  He said 
20110114000753.000|20110114000756.000|TR0|there hasn't been a lot of swelling and 
20110114000756.000|20110114000758.000|TR0|you know he just showed that in great 
20110114000758.000|20110114000801.000|TR0|detail, but you know I was curious 
20110114000801.000|20110114000803.000|TR0|especially after talking to Captain Kelly 
20110114000803.000|20110114000806.000|TR0|of what Dr. Lemole's perception was and 
20110114000806.000|20110114000808.000|TR0|exactly what the congresswoman knows right 
20110114000808.000|20110114000811.000|TR0|now.  I mean does she understand what is 
20110114000811.000|20110114000813.000|TR0|going on with her and I asked him about 
20110114000813.000|20110114000816.000|TR0|that.  Take a listen.

20110114000823.000|20110114000825.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Do you feel that she understands 
20110114000825.000|20110114000828.000|TR0|all that has happened to her?
20110114000828.000|20110114000830.000|TR0|
20110114000830.000|20110114000833.000|TR0|DR. MICHAEL LEMOLE, CHIEF OF NEUROSURGERY: 
20110114000833.000|20110114000835.000|TR0| I'm starting to think so.
20110114000835.000|20110114000838.000|TR0|
20110114000838.000|20110114000840.000|TR0|GUPTA:  She knows.
20110114000840.000|20110114000843.000|TR0|
20110114000843.000|20110114000845.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  It's really -- I was there when 
20110114000845.000|20110114000848.000|TR0|the congresswoman and the senator were in 
20110114000848.000|20110114000850.000|TR0|the room and to see her open her eye and 
20110114000850.000|20110114000853.000|TR0|look at them, there's just no question in 
20110114000853.000|20110114000855.000|TR0|my mind.  And she's done that for her 
20110114000855.000|20110114000858.000|TR0|husband, as well.  Those glimmers of 
20110114000858.000|20110114000900.000|TR0|recognition, that tracking of the eyes 
20110114000900.000|20110114000903.000|TR0|tells you a whole lot more, that she is 
20110114000903.000|20110114000905.000|TR0|aware of her surroundings to some extent 
20110114000905.000|20110114000908.000|TR0|coming in and out perhaps and that she's 
20110114000908.000|20110114000910.000|TR0|trying to engage that reality, as well.
20110114000910.000|20110114000913.000|TR0|
20110114000913.000|20110114000915.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110114000915.000|20110114000918.000|TR0|
20110114000918.000|20110114000920.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You know so we've been talking 
20110114000920.000|20110114000923.000|TR0|about the fact that she follows commands, 
20110114000923.000|20110114000925.000|TR0|John, obviously significant because it 
20110114000925.000|20110114000928.000|TR0|shows a certain higher level of cognitive 
20110114000928.000|20110114000930.000|TR0|and consciousness in terms of her 
20110114000930.000|20110114000932.000|TR0|function.  This is more than that.  And I 
20110114000932.000|20110114000935.000|TR0|think that's why Lemole is excited.  I 
20110114000935.000|20110114000937.000|TR0|think that's why Captain Kelly was 
20110114000937.000|20110114000940.000|TR0|excited, the fact that she now is getting 
20110114000940.000|20110114000942.000|TR0|some recognition, sort of putting the 
20110114000942.000|20110114000945.000|TR0|pieces of the puzzle together, John.  
20110114000945.000|20110114000947.000|TR0|That's what Lemole and Captain Kelly were 
20110114000947.000|20110114000950.000|TR0|really describing to me today.
20110114000950.000|20110114000952.000|TR0|
20110114000952.000|20110114000955.000|TR0|KING:  And Doc, help me the best you can 
20110114000955.000|20110114000957.000|TR0|here.  I'm sure in your experience you 
20110114000957.000|20110114001000.000|TR0|have lost patients that you thought were 
20110114001000.000|20110114001002.000|TR0|going to make it and that patients have 
20110114001002.000|20110114001005.000|TR0|made it that you thought you were going to 
20110114001005.000|20110114001007.000|TR0|lose.  At the briefing earlier today, Dr. 
20110114001007.000|20110114001010.000|TR0|Lemole was saying you know miracles happen 
20110114001010.000|20110114001012.000|TR0|every day and most doctors like to think 
20110114001012.000|20110114001015.000|TR0|it was their work or the work of somebody 
20110114001015.000|20110114001017.000|TR0|else in the medical team, but he also says 
20110114001017.000|20110114001020.000|TR0|sometimes you just can't connect those 
20110114001020.000|20110114001022.000|TR0|dots and let's just not understate that 
20110114001022.000|20110114001025.000|TR0|there are miracles in our lives.  How 
20110114001025.000|20110114001027.000|TR0|spiritual I guess are you when you're 
20110114001027.000|20110114001030.000|TR0|trained clinically, you're practiced not 
20110114001030.000|20110114001032.000|TR0|to panic, but what is the spirituality of 
20110114001032.000|20110114001035.000|TR0|the moment?
20110114001035.000|20110114001037.000|TR0|
20110114001037.000|20110114001039.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, there -- you know as much as 
20110114001039.000|20110114001042.000|TR0|we'd like to think we know everything 
20110114001042.000|20110114001044.000|TR0|there is to know about these operations 
20110114001044.000|20110114001047.000|TR0|and predictive of the outcomes and all 
20110114001047.000|20110114001049.000|TR0|that, you're absolutely right, John.  I've 
20110114001049.000|20110114001052.000|TR0|been surprised and I think every surgeon 
20110114001052.000|20110114001054.000|TR0|probably has been surprised in both 
20110114001054.000|20110114001057.000|TR0|directions.  Things that you thought were 
20110114001057.000|20110114001059.000|TR0|flawless and the outcome was not what you 
20110114001059.000|20110114001102.000|TR0|wanted and vice versa, where patients 
20110114001102.000|20110114001104.000|TR0|somehow recovered in some way that you 
20110114001104.000|20110114001107.000|TR0|just could not possibly explain.
20110114001107.000|20110114001109.000|TR0|
20110114001109.000|20110114001112.000|TR0|And families ask you can you explain to me 
20110114001112.000|20110114001114.000|TR0|what happened here and you simply can't.  
20110114001114.000|20110114001117.000|TR0|And I think that Lemole is referring to 
20110114001117.000|20110114001119.000|TR0|that.  He is a very good neurosurgeon, no 
20110114001119.000|20110114001122.000|TR0|question he was very quick in terms of 
20110114001122.000|20110114001124.000|TR0|being able to take her to the operating 
20110114001124.000|20110114001127.000|TR0|room and do that operation. But you know 
20110114001127.000|20110114001129.000|TR0|he even -- he thought that she was going 
20110114001129.000|20110114001132.000|TR0|to have some backwards days as he told 
20110114001132.000|20110114001134.000|TR0|Captain Kelly and myself that she was just 
20110114001134.000|20110114001137.000|TR0|going to backward, you know move backwards 
20110114001137.000|20110114001139.000|TR0|over a couple of days, and she just hasn't 
20110114001139.000|20110114001142.000|TR0|done that.  She's moved forward every 
20110114001142.000|20110114001144.000|TR0|single day for the last five days and I 
20110114001144.000|20110114001147.000|TR0|think that's what is so -- probably that's 
20110114001147.000|20110114001149.000|TR0|the most astounding part of this for the 
20110114001149.000|20110114001151.000|TR0|doctors caring for her.
20110114001151.000|20110114001154.000|TR0|
20110114001154.000|20110114001156.000|TR0|KING:  It is remarkable.  Sanjay, before I 
20110114001156.000|20110114001159.000|TR0|let you go, you also had a chance to talk 
20110114001159.000|20110114001201.000|TR0|another shooting victim who is recovering 
20110114001201.000|20110114001204.000|TR0|in that hospital, Ron Barber and I'm told 
20110114001204.000|20110114001206.000|TR0|he relayed quite a remarkable story to 
20110114001206.000|20110114001209.000|TR0|you.  Share it with us.
20110114001209.000|20110114001211.000|TR0|
20110114001211.000|20110114001214.000|TR0|GUPTA:  It's hard to tell, John, the 
20110114001214.000|20110114001216.000|TR0|story.  And I've been thinking about it 
20110114001216.000|20110114001219.000|TR0|almost since I spoke with him.  Ron Barber 
20110114001219.000|20110114001221.000|TR0|is a staff member, a community outreach 
20110114001221.000|20110114001224.000|TR0|member for the congresswoman.  He worked 
20110114001224.000|20110114001226.000|TR0|40 years in another job, development of 
20110114001226.000|20110114001229.000|TR0|disabilities (ph), was retired, and he 
20110114001229.000|20110114001231.000|TR0|came back to work for the congresswoman.  
20110114001231.000|20110114001234.000|TR0|He was standing next to her on the day 
20110114001234.000|20110114001236.000|TR0|that this happened.
20110114001236.000|20110114001239.000|TR0|
20110114001239.000|20110114001241.000|TR0|And he -- like some of the other stories 
20110114001241.000|20110114001244.000|TR0|you heard, he saw some activity and 
20110114001244.000|20110114001246.000|TR0|started to recognize something was wrong.  
20110114001246.000|20110114001249.000|TR0|And he told me he was looking at the 
20110114001249.000|20110114001251.000|TR0|congresswoman when she was shot.  He was 
20110114001251.000|20110114001254.000|TR0|looking at her.  And obviously realized 
20110114001254.000|20110114001256.000|TR0|what had happened and then he turned 
20110114001256.000|20110114001259.000|TR0|around like this and he himself was shot 
20110114001259.000|20110114001301.000|TR0|in the face and in the leg. And when he 
20110114001301.000|20110114001303.000|TR0|fell down, John, this is almost hard to 
20110114001303.000|20110114001306.000|TR0|talk about -- when he fell down the 
20110114001306.000|20110114001308.000|TR0|congresswoman was facing in the other 
20110114001308.000|20110114001311.000|TR0|direction.
20110114001311.000|20110114001313.000|TR0|
20110114001313.000|20110114001316.000|TR0|He fell down next to her so he was facing 
20110114001316.000|20110114001318.000|TR0|her back.  And they were both just slumped 
20110114001318.000|20110114001321.000|TR0|over.  And he was a wake.  He was 
20110114001321.000|20110114001323.000|TR0|conscious. He was you know cognizant of 
20110114001323.000|20110114001326.000|TR0|what was happening.  And then right in 
20110114001326.000|20110114001328.000|TR0|between them fell Gabe, Gabe Zimmerman.  
20110114001328.000|20110114001331.000|TR0|He fell down and Ron had a hard time 
20110114001331.000|20110114001333.000|TR0|talking about this, but he wanted to tell 
20110114001333.000|20110114001336.000|TR0|the story as a part his own catharsis I 
20110114001336.000|20110114001338.000|TR0|believe, but he saw Gabe fall right in 
20110114001338.000|20110114001341.000|TR0|between him and the congresswoman and he 
20110114001341.000|20110114001343.000|TR0|said he was clearly had died.
20110114001343.000|20110114001346.000|TR0|
20110114001346.000|20110114001348.000|TR0|He was still.  He was not moving.  He saw 
20110114001348.000|20110114001351.000|TR0|significant gunshot to his body.  And he 
20110114001351.000|20110114001353.000|TR0|described that.  You know he also 
20110114001353.000|20110114001356.000|TR0|described the fact that he had significant 
20110114001356.000|20110114001358.000|TR0|bleeding coming out of a wound in his leg, 
20110114001358.000|20110114001401.000|TR0|one of the major blood vessels there and a 
20110114001401.000|20110114001403.000|TR0|bystander, someone who is not part of this 
20110114001403.000|20110114001406.000|TR0|event at all.  It was just someone 
20110114001406.000|20110114001408.000|TR0|actually going to the Safeway to shop, 
20110114001408.000|20110114001410.000|TR0|actually put pressure on his leg and all 
20110114001410.000|20110114001413.000|TR0|the doctors here and Ron himself said 
20110114001413.000|20110114001415.000|TR0|there's no question it saved his life.
20110114001415.000|20110114001418.000|TR0|
20110114001418.000|20110114001420.000|TR0|He was bleeding so profusely from this 
20110114001420.000|20110114001423.000|TR0|injury that she saved his life.  I don't 
20110114001423.000|20110114001425.000|TR0|know if you're looking at video, John, but 
20110114001425.000|20110114001428.000|TR0|apparently this woman, Anna, was with him 
20110114001428.000|20110114001430.000|TR0|today.  He got to meet this woman, the 
20110114001430.000|20110114001433.000|TR0|woman who saved his life today, and they 
20110114001433.000|20110114001435.000|TR0|were strolling around here behind me at 
20110114001435.000|20110114001438.000|TR0|the memorial.  But it was just -- it was 
20110114001438.000|20110114001440.000|TR0|an unbelievable story.  I have, you know 
20110114001440.000|20110114001443.000|TR0|I've never heard anything quite like that, 
20110114001443.000|20110114001445.000|TR0|the horror of it and then the unbelievable 
20110114001445.000|20110114001448.000|TR0|heroic efforts of it, as well.
20110114001448.000|20110114001450.000|TR0|
20110114001450.000|20110114001453.000|TR0|KING:  Dr. Sanjay Gupta on the scene for 
20110114001453.000|20110114001455.000|TR0|us -- Doc, fascinating reporting.  Keep at 
20110114001455.000|20110114001458.000|TR0|it.  Thanks so much for sharing all that 
20110114001458.000|20110114001500.000|TR0|exclusive access with us today.  We'll be 
20110114001500.000|20110114001503.000|TR0|in touch with Dr. Gupta.  Thank you, 
20110114001503.000|20110114001505.000|TR0|Sanjay.
20110114001505.000|20110114001508.000|TR0|
20110114001508.000|20110114001510.000|TR0|Now to some important developments in the 
20110114001510.000|20110114001513.000|TR0|investigation today, the authorities now 
20110114001513.000|20110114001515.000|TR0|have a black bag and they're testing it to 
20110114001515.000|20110114001518.000|TR0|learn if it is the one suspected assassin 
20110114001518.000|20110114001520.000|TR0|Jared Lee Loughner had the morning of the 
20110114001520.000|20110114001522.000|TR0|massacre.  With us on the telephone now 
20110114001522.000|20110114001525.000|TR0|one of the lead investigators, Bureau 
20110114001525.000|20110114001527.000|TR0|Chief Richard Kastigar of the Pima County 
20110114001527.000|20110114001530.000|TR0|Sheriff's Office -- sir, it's good to 
20110114001530.000|20110114001532.000|TR0|speak with you tonight.
20110114001532.000|20110114001535.000|TR0|
20110114001535.000|20110114001537.000|TR0|When we spoke yesterday, you said this was 
20110114001537.000|20110114001540.000|TR0|among the pieces of evidence you were 
20110114001540.000|20110114001542.000|TR0|looking for.  They have found it today.  
20110114001542.000|20110114001545.000|TR0|As we speak tonight, are you certain or 
20110114001545.000|20110114001547.000|TR0|not yet certain it is the bag that Mr. 
20110114001547.000|20110114001550.000|TR0|Loughner's father said he had that morning?
20110114001550.000|20110114001552.000|TR0|
20110114001552.000|20110114001555.000|TR0|RICHARD KASTIGAR, BUREAU CHIEF, PIMA CO. 
20110114001555.000|20110114001557.000|TR0|SHERIFF'S DEPT. (via phone):  Well, John, 
20110114001557.000|20110114001600.000|TR0|we're absolutely not certain, but we 
20110114001600.000|20110114001602.000|TR0|certainly have very good reason to believe 
20110114001602.000|20110114001605.000|TR0|that this is related.  The location that 
20110114001605.000|20110114001607.000|TR0|the bag was found at, its description as 
20110114001607.000|20110114001610.000|TR0|per the dad, and even the contents are 
20110114001610.000|20110114001612.000|TR0|very, very, very suggestive to lead a 
20110114001612.000|20110114001615.000|TR0|reasonable person to conclude that this is 
20110114001615.000|20110114001617.000|TR0|likely what was involved in this case.
20110114001617.000|20110114001620.000|TR0|
20110114001620.000|20110114001622.000|TR0|This is one of the pieces of missing 
20110114001622.000|20110114001625.000|TR0|evidence.  Obviously we have to be 
20110114001625.000|20110114001627.000|TR0|cautious, we have to take that bag as well 
20110114001627.000|20110114001630.000|TR0|as its content and I think by now your 
20110114001630.000|20110114001632.000|TR0|listeners know that there were several -- 
20110114001632.000|20110114001634.000|TR0|or several boxes of ammunition in there, 
20110114001634.000|20110114001637.000|TR0|the ammunition type happens to fit the 
20110114001637.000|20110114001639.000|TR0|weapon that was used.  And we have to take 
20110114001639.000|20110114001642.000|TR0|that and we have to do trace evidence.
20110114001642.000|20110114001644.000|TR0|
20110114001644.000|20110114001647.000|TR0|It's with the FBI now.  I'm certain that 
20110114001647.000|20110114001649.000|TR0|they're going to be looking for everything 
20110114001649.000|20110114001652.000|TR0|from fingerprints to DNA, so there's a 
20110114001652.000|20110114001654.000|TR0|little bit more work to do, but I feel 
20110114001654.000|20110114001657.000|TR0|comfortable in telling you that it's very 
20110114001657.000|20110114001659.000|TR0|likely involved in this incident.
20110114001659.000|20110114001702.000|TR0|
20110114001702.000|20110114001704.000|TR0|KING:  And so that would help you, 
20110114001704.000|20110114001707.000|TR0|assuming you are correct, it would help 
20110114001707.000|20110114001709.000|TR0|you with the what and the how.  When we 
20110114001709.000|20110114001712.000|TR0|were speaking yesterday, we were still 
20110114001712.000|20110114001714.000|TR0|trying to answer the big and the most 
20110114001714.000|20110114001717.000|TR0|important riddle of why, anything else in 
20110114001717.000|20110114001719.000|TR0|the bag?  There's ammunition I'm told, the 
20110114001719.000|20110114001722.000|TR0|receipts I'm told.  Any other notes, news 
20110114001722.000|20110114001724.000|TR0|clippings, anything at all that would give 
20110114001724.000|20110114001727.000|TR0|you any sense to motive?
20110114001727.000|20110114001729.000|TR0|
20110114001729.000|20110114001732.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well, I can tell you there are 
20110114001732.000|20110114001734.000|TR0|other things in the bag, but I'm not going 
20110114001734.000|20110114001737.000|TR0|to discuss the specifics because we need 
20110114001737.000|20110114001739.000|TR0|to substantiate through others who might 
20110114001739.000|20110114001741.000|TR0|have been involved with what is in the bag 
20110114001741.000|20110114001744.000|TR0|how they got there.  So it sounds a little 
20110114001744.000|20110114001746.000|TR0|bit coy perhaps in our approach to this to 
20110114001746.000|20110114001749.000|TR0|you folks, but to be very honest, we need 
20110114001749.000|20110114001751.000|TR0|to protect this as evidence and go talk to 
20110114001751.000|20110114001754.000|TR0|people who may have further information 
20110114001754.000|20110114001756.000|TR0|that can substantiate how the items in the 
20110114001756.000|20110114001759.000|TR0|bag got there.
20110114001759.000|20110114001801.000|TR0|
20110114001801.000|20110114001804.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110114001804.000|20110114001806.000|TR0|
20110114001806.000|20110114001809.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Suffice it to say we got 
20110114001809.000|20110114001811.000|TR0|ammunition in there and it matches that 
20110114001811.000|20110114001814.000|TR0|type of ammunition that was used in this 
20110114001814.000|20110114001816.000|TR0|incident.
20110114001816.000|20110114001819.000|TR0|
20110114001819.000|20110114001821.000|TR0|KING:  Is -- are the other materials, I 
20110114001821.000|20110114001824.000|TR0|understand and respect the need for 
20110114001824.000|20110114001826.000|TR0|privacy and to protect the integrity of 
20110114001826.000|20110114001829.000|TR0|the evidence. Are the other materials 
20110114001829.000|20110114001831.000|TR0|something that could get you into the 
20110114001831.000|20110114001834.000|TR0|motive issue if you are certain -- if you 
20110114001834.000|20110114001836.000|TR0|are certain they were not put in after the 
20110114001836.000|20110114001839.000|TR0|fact or if they have his fingerprints, for 
20110114001839.000|20110114001841.000|TR0|example?
20110114001841.000|20110114001844.000|TR0|
20110114001844.000|20110114001846.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  They don't really lead to a 
20110114001846.000|20110114001849.000|TR0|motive, John, but they certainly do tell 
20110114001849.000|20110114001851.000|TR0|us that there's a relationship between 
20110114001851.000|20110114001853.000|TR0|what's in the bag and what happened on 
20110114001853.000|20110114001856.000|TR0|Saturday and what his movements were 
20110114001856.000|20110114001858.000|TR0|leading up to that time.
20110114001858.000|20110114001901.000|TR0|
20110114001901.000|20110114001903.000|TR0|KING:  By that can I assume some notice of 
20110114001903.000|20110114001906.000|TR0|the event or some photographs of the site 
20110114001906.000|20110114001908.000|TR0|or something to that effect?
20110114001908.000|20110114001911.000|TR0|
20110114001911.000|20110114001913.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well it gives us some 
20110114001913.000|20110114001916.000|TR0|indication where he was and what he was 
20110114001916.000|20110114001918.000|TR0|doing.
20110114001918.000|20110114001921.000|TR0|
20110114001921.000|20110114001923.000|TR0|KING:  All right, let me move on to 
20110114001923.000|20110114001926.000|TR0|another question.  A bunch of reports, we 
20110114001926.000|20110114001928.000|TR0|talked about this yesterday and you were 
20110114001928.000|20110114001931.000|TR0|adamant that there was nothing in the 
20110114001931.000|20110114001933.000|TR0|record, he has a few minor offenses in the 
20110114001933.000|20110114001936.000|TR0|past that young people get involved, drug 
20110114001936.000|20110114001938.000|TR0|paraphernalia, underage drinking, but you 
20110114001938.000|20110114001941.000|TR0|said there was nothing in the record, at 
20110114001941.000|20110114001943.000|TR0|least in front of your department that 
20110114001943.000|20110114001946.000|TR0|would say, wait a minute, we've got a 
20110114001946.000|20110114001948.000|TR0|problem here, we need to intervene and do 
20110114001948.000|20110114001951.000|TR0|something.
20110114001951.000|20110114001953.000|TR0|
20110114001953.000|20110114001956.000|TR0|The Pima Community College Department of 
20110114001956.000|20110114001958.000|TR0|Public Safety released a bunch of reports 
20110114001958.000|20110114002000.000|TR0|today and there are evidence in here that 
20110114002000.000|20110114002003.000|TR0|no, no direct threats against anybody, but 
20110114002003.000|20110114002005.000|TR0|the people who were around this guy at the 
20110114002005.000|20110114002008.000|TR0|school felt threatened.  They thought he 
20110114002008.000|20110114002010.000|TR0|was capable of violence.  In Arizona, you 
20110114002010.000|20110114002013.000|TR0|can petition and go and say this person 
20110114002013.000|20110114002015.000|TR0|has a problem.  This person I think is 
20110114002015.000|20110114002018.000|TR0|unstable.
20110114002018.000|20110114002020.000|TR0|
20110114002020.000|20110114002023.000|TR0|This person I think is dangerous and you 
20110114002023.000|20110114002025.000|TR0|can petition to have them forced into 
20110114002025.000|20110114002028.000|TR0|mental health treatment, at least an 
20110114002028.000|20110114002030.000|TR0|evaluation.  Do you believe when you look 
20110114002030.000|20110114002033.000|TR0|at this evidence that someone at that 
20110114002033.000|20110114002035.000|TR0|school and the police department or the 
20110114002035.000|20110114002038.000|TR0|administration should have taken that step?
20110114002038.000|20110114002040.000|TR0|
20110114002040.000|20110114002043.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well I can tell you that 
20110114002043.000|20110114002045.000|TR0|hindsight is certainly 20/20 and I know 
20110114002045.000|20110114002048.000|TR0|that's cliquish (ph) in my comment.  But 
20110114002048.000|20110114002050.000|TR0|there's still not specific information 
20110114002050.000|20110114002053.000|TR0|that would lead a reasonable person to 
20110114002053.000|20110114002055.000|TR0|conclude of what the events would be just 
20110114002055.000|20110114002058.000|TR0|a few days ago.  This individual certainly 
20110114002058.000|20110114002100.000|TR0|had some bizarre behavior and it's easy to 
20110114002100.000|20110114002103.000|TR0|sit back and say, you know what, this guy 
20110114002103.000|20110114002105.000|TR0|was very strange in the classroom and 
20110114002105.000|20110114002108.000|TR0|disruptive and I could have predicted that.
20110114002108.000|20110114002110.000|TR0|
20110114002110.000|20110114002112.000|TR0|Well I'm going to tell you we couldn't 
20110114002112.000|20110114002115.000|TR0|have predicted that.  The other difficulty 
20110114002115.000|20110114002117.000|TR0|is what the other police department 
20110114002117.000|20110114002120.000|TR0|reported was not of a criminal nature and 
20110114002120.000|20110114002122.000|TR0|it might have violated the college campus' 
20110114002122.000|20110114002125.000|TR0|administrative rules and it might have 
20110114002125.000|20110114002127.000|TR0|caused them to take administrative action 
20110114002127.000|20110114002130.000|TR0|against him, but there was very little 
20110114002130.000|20110114002132.000|TR0|criminal action.  And another thing, John, 
20110114002132.000|20110114002135.000|TR0|you need to understand, although there's a 
20110114002135.000|20110114002137.000|TR0|little more specificity with regard to the 
20110114002137.000|20110114002140.000|TR0|issue of commitment, and you really have 
20110114002140.000|20110114002142.000|TR0|to make a direct threat to yourself or 
20110114002142.000|20110114002145.000|TR0|someone else before you may be 
20110114002145.000|20110114002147.000|TR0|involuntarily committed.
20110114002147.000|20110114002150.000|TR0|
20110114002150.000|20110114002152.000|TR0|Now, voluntary commitment is a different 
20110114002152.000|20110114002155.000|TR0|issue.  And that would rest with the 
20110114002155.000|20110114002157.000|TR0|individual and/or the caretakers and/or 
20110114002157.000|20110114002200.000|TR0|perhaps the parents' influence.  But 
20110114002200.000|20110114002202.000|TR0|involuntary commitments are a little bit 
20110114002202.000|20110114002205.000|TR0|more of a difficult challenge.
20110114002205.000|20110114002207.000|TR0|
20110114002207.000|20110114002210.000|TR0|KING:  Chief Kastigar, appreciate your

20110114002229.000|20110114002232.000|TR0|we come back, one of the friends who was 
20110114002232.000|20110114002234.000|TR0|in the room when Congresswoman Giffords 
20110114002234.000|20110114002237.000|TR0|first opened her eyes and a sense of 
20110114002237.000|20110114002239.000|TR0|whether the tone might be different when 
20110114002239.000|20110114002242.000|TR0|Congress gets back to business next week 
20110114002242.000|20110114002244.000|TR0|and Republicans push to repeal the Obama 
20110114002244.000|20110114002247.000|TR0|health care law -- first, though, a

20110114002302.000|20110114002304.000|TR0|life uncommon for a girl her age.  She'd 
20110114002304.000|20110114002307.000|TR0|remind her mother, we are so blessed.  We

20110114002319.000|20110114002322.000|TR0|comforting. We have to be strong.  Our

20110114002404.000|20110114002406.000|TR0|at last night's memorial service in Tucson 
20110114002406.000|20110114002409.000|TR0|and who just before that ceremony 
20110114002409.000|20110114002411.000|TR0|participated in what she likes to call a 
20110114002411.000|20110114002414.000|TR0|miracle.  Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman 
20110114002414.000|20110114002416.000|TR0|Schultz of Florida joins us now.  And 
20110114002416.000|20110114002419.000|TR0|Congresswoman I want to ask you about what 
20110114002419.000|20110114002421.000|TR0|comes next week when you get back to 
20110114002421.000|20110114002424.000|TR0|business and back to repealing health

20110114002429.000|20110114002431.000|TR0|inside the room last night, you're 
20110114002431.000|20110114002434.000|TR0|visiting your friend Gabby Giffords, the

20110114002443.000|20110114002446.000|TR0|FLORIDA:  Well, it was nothing short of a 
20110114002446.000|20110114002448.000|TR0|miracle.  I don't know that I've ever -- 
20110114002448.000|20110114002451.000|TR0|other than the birth of my kids, I don't 
20110114002451.000|20110114002453.000|TR0|know that I've ever been that close to a 
20110114002453.000|20110114002456.000|TR0|miracle.  But just first of all the thrill 
20110114002456.000|20110114002458.000|TR0|and the joy to be able to be there for my

20110114002516.000|20110114002518.000|TR0|know some of the good times we've had.  I 
20110114002518.000|20110114002521.000|TR0|said to her at one point, Gabby, you know 
20110114002521.000|20110114002523.000|TR0|you need to get better as quick as you can 
20110114002523.000|20110114002526.000|TR0|because we expect you back in New 
20110114002526.000|20110114002528.000|TR0|Hampshire where we've -- they vacationed 
20110114002528.000|20110114002531.000|TR0|with us the last couple of summers.  And 
20110114002531.000|20110114002533.000|TR0|right when I did that, John, she -- her 
20110114002533.000|20110114002536.000|TR0|eyes just started to open slightly, just 
20110114002536.000|20110114002538.000|TR0|in slits.  And then Mark, her husband, he 
20110114002538.000|20110114002541.000|TR0|just got so excited.
20110114002541.000|20110114002543.000|TR0|
20110114002543.000|20110114002546.000|TR0|He said Gabby, Gabby, if you can see me, 
20110114002546.000|20110114002548.000|TR0|then give me the thumbs up sign and she 
20110114002548.000|20110114002551.000|TR0|couldn't do it -- she didn't do it not 
20110114002551.000|20110114002553.000|TR0|right away. Then we just kept talking to 
20110114002553.000|20110114002555.000|TR0|her and the doctor said oh my gosh this is 
20110114002555.000|20110114002558.000|TR0|incredible progress.  He whips out his 
20110114002558.000|20110114002600.000|TR0|BlackBerry.  I see him out of the corner 
20110114002600.000|20110114002603.000|TR0|of my eye, e-mailing frantically, then -- 
20110114002603.000|20110114002605.000|TR0|and we're all getting overcome with 
20110114002605.000|20110114002608.000|TR0|emotion and continuing to talk to her and 
20110114002608.000|20110114002610.000|TR0|urging her on, you know Mark said Gabby 
20110114002610.000|20110114002613.000|TR0|open your eyes again.
20110114002613.000|20110114002615.000|TR0|
20110114002615.000|20110114002618.000|TR0|Can you see me?  Give me the thumbs up.  
20110114002618.000|20110114002620.000|TR0|And then all of a sudden she opened them 
20110114002620.000|20110114002623.000|TR0|up a little bit more and a little bit more 
20110114002623.000|20110114002625.000|TR0|and then her arm flew up after the last 
20110114002625.000|20110114002628.000|TR0|time, he asked her to give, to give him a 
20110114002628.000|20110114002630.000|TR0|thumbs up, and he said touch my ring, 
20110114002630.000|20110114002633.000|TR0|honey, and she did.  And she touched his 
20110114002633.000|20110114002635.000|TR0|arm.  And, John, it was just -- my heart I 
20110114002635.000|20110114002638.000|TR0|think was about to burst out of my chest.  
20110114002638.000|20110114002640.000|TR0|It was just amazing.
20110114002640.000|20110114002643.000|TR0|
20110114002643.000|20110114002645.000|TR0|KING:  And you have zero doubt, zero doubt 
20110114002645.000|20110114002648.000|TR0|that she knew who was talking to her and 
20110114002648.000|20110114002650.000|TR0|exactly -- and she was responding to 
20110114002650.000|20110114002653.000|TR0|specific words and commands?
20110114002653.000|20110114002655.000|TR0|
20110114002655.000|20110114002658.000|TR0|SCHULTZ:  Oh, look, I'm no medical expert, 
20110114002658.000|20110114002700.000|TR0|but it was very clear that she was 
20110114002700.000|20110114002702.000|TR0|responding to our voices, to what we were 
20110114002702.000|20110114002705.000|TR0|saying.  And I mean actually after we left 
20110114002705.000|20110114002707.000|TR0|the hospital room, Dr. Lemole, who has 
20110114002707.000|20110114002710.000|TR0|been on the news and so wonderfully 
20110114002710.000|20110114002712.000|TR0|explained what's going on medically to the 
20110114002712.000|20110114002715.000|TR0|country, he said, you know and he's pretty 
20110114002715.000|20110114002717.000|TR0|matter of fact guy.  Not easily impressed 
20110114002717.000|20110114002720.000|TR0|like most doctors don't seem to be. And he 
20110114002720.000|20110114002722.000|TR0|said to us, look, I usually dismiss 
20110114002722.000|20110114002725.000|TR0|emotion and the impact of emotion and 
20110114002725.000|20110114002727.000|TR0|friendship, and he said to us we just 
20110114002727.000|20110114002730.000|TR0|witnessed the power of friendship.  So I 
20110114002730.000|20110114002732.000|TR0|just -- it was incredible.
20110114002732.000|20110114002735.000|TR0|
20110114002735.000|20110114002737.000|TR0|KING:  Did he sound any cautionary --
20110114002737.000|20110114002740.000|TR0|
20110114002740.000|20110114002742.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110114002742.000|20110114002745.000|TR0|
20110114002745.000|20110114002747.000|TR0|KING:  We don't know sadly and the signs 
20110114002747.000|20110114002750.000|TR0|are very optimistic and what you saw last 
20110114002750.000|20110114002752.000|TR0|night is incredible and I'm glad you're 
20110114002752.000|20110114002755.000|TR0|helping us understand it -- any cautionary 
20110114002755.000|20110114002757.000|TR0|notes about what it tells you about where 
20110114002757.000|20110114002800.000|TR0|she can get?
20110114002800.000|20110114002802.000|TR0|
20110114002802.000|20110114002805.000|TR0|SCHULTZ:  Oh, yes.  He absolutely 
20110114002805.000|20110114002807.000|TR0|continued to caution us and everyone that 
20110114002807.000|20110114002810.000|TR0|there is a long road ahead and -- but the 
20110114002810.000|20110114002812.000|TR0|hopeful thing was how happy they were that 
20110114002812.000|20110114002814.000|TR0|this was significant progress so soon 
20110114002814.000|20110114002817.000|TR0|after the injury.  But there is a long way 
20110114002817.000|20110114002819.000|TR0|to go.  There's no question about it and 
20110114002819.000|20110114002822.000|TR0|that can't be understated.
20110114002822.000|20110114002824.000|TR0|
20110114002824.000|20110114002827.000|TR0|KING:  What were you told to expect going 
20110114002827.000|20110114002829.000|TR0|into the room?  I assume it was a lower 
20110114002829.000|20110114002832.000|TR0|expectation which is what made it all the 
20110114002832.000|20110114002834.000|TR0|more dramatic and miracle.
20110114002834.000|20110114002837.000|TR0|
20110114002837.000|20110114002839.000|TR0|SCHULTZ:  Oh, yes.  I mean I -- you know I 
20110114002839.000|20110114002842.000|TR0|had a chance to talk to Mark on the phone 
20110114002842.000|20110114002844.000|TR0|and we've been texting back and forth.  
20110114002844.000|20110114002847.000|TR0|And so you know I was aware of what she 
20110114002847.000|20110114002849.000|TR0|looked like and actually she looked so 
20110114002849.000|20110114002852.000|TR0|much better than -- she looked beautiful 
20110114002852.000|20110114002854.000|TR0|actually -- so much better than I 
20110114002854.000|20110114002857.000|TR0|expected.  I mean I have not seen someone 
20110114002857.000|20110114002859.000|TR0|who has had a gunshot wound ever in my 
20110114002859.000|20110114002902.000|TR0|life.
20110114002902.000|20110114002904.000|TR0|
20110114002904.000|20110114002907.000|TR0|But she -- and I don't want to violate her 
20110114002907.000|20110114002909.000|TR0|privacy, so I'm not going to describe 
20110114002909.000|20110114002912.000|TR0|anything, but she looks -- her strength 
20110114002912.000|20110114002914.000|TR0|really, you could see it in her.  We could 
20110114002914.000|20110114002917.000|TR0|feel it with her struggling to open her 
20110114002917.000|20110114002919.000|TR0|eyes.  I mean you could see every ounce of 
20110114002919.000|20110114002922.000|TR0|Gabby Giffords' determination that I know 
20110114002922.000|20110114002924.000|TR0|so well just pouring out of her to get 
20110114002924.000|20110114002926.000|TR0|those eyes open and to respond to our 
20110114002926.000|20110114002929.000|TR0|voices and to Mark's encouragement.
20110114002929.000|20110114002931.000|TR0|
20110114002931.000|20110114002934.000|TR0|KING:  It is remarkable and we will 
20110114002934.000|20110114002936.000|TR0|continue to pray as I know you will.

20110114002944.000|20110114002946.000|TR0|KING:  It's a tough transition to make, 
20110114002946.000|20110114002949.000|TR0|but the Republican leadership says it's 
20110114002949.000|20110114002951.000|TR0|back to work next week.  And one of the 
20110114002951.000|20110114002954.000|TR0|questions, and the president talked about 
20110114002954.000|20110114002956.000|TR0|this last night, can we be more civil in 
20110114002956.000|20110114002959.000|TR0|our politics.  You are going to get to the 
20110114002959.000|20110114003001.000|TR0|business; the House Republicans want to 
20110114003001.000|20110114003004.000|TR0|repeal the health care bill.  And as you 
20110114003004.000|20110114003006.000|TR0|well know that was one of the most 
20110114003006.000|20110114003009.000|TR0|emotional, some would say vitriolics (ph), 
20110114003009.000|20110114003011.000|TR0|certainly a lot of hyperbole in the debate 
20110114003011.000|20110114003014.000|TR0|about it in the Congress and throughout 
20110114003014.000|20110114003016.000|TR0|the last campaign season.

20110114003019.000|20110114003021.000|TR0|The question is what next.  I want you to 
20110114003021.000|20110114003024.000|TR0|listen here to one Republican and one 
20110114003024.000|20110114003026.000|TR0|Democrat.  This is from just last week on 
20110114003026.000|20110114003029.000|TR0|the prospect of moving ahead for the 
20110114003029.000|20110114003031.000|TR0|repeal.  This is not as tough as it was in 
20110114003031.000|20110114003033.000|TR0|the first debate, not as tough as it was 
20110114003033.000|20110114003036.000|TR0|in the campaign but listen to this

20110114003138.000|20110114003141.000|TR0|will Republicans say, no, these are the 
20110114003141.000|20110114003143.000|TR0|provisions we don't like and whether it's 
20110114003143.000|20110114003145.000|TR0|the reach of government or the cost or 
20110114003145.000|20110114003148.000|TR0|whatever.  Will we have a policy debate or 
20110114003148.000|20110114003150.000|TR0|will we have that?
20110114003150.000|20110114003153.000|TR0|
20110114003153.000|20110114003155.000|TR0|SCHULTZ:  I am no less opposed to 
20110114003155.000|20110114003158.000|TR0|repealing health care reform than I was 
20110114003158.000|20110114003200.000|TR0|last week before this tragic accident -- 
20110114003200.000|20110114003203.000|TR0|this tragedy happened.  But I think we all 
20110114003203.000|20110114003205.000|TR0|need to -- we have to lead by example in 
20110114003205.000|20110114003208.000|TR0|Congress and then hopefully others who are 
20110114003208.000|20110114003210.000|TR0|outside the congressional process will 
20110114003210.000|20110114003213.000|TR0|almost be shamed into taking a page from 
20110114003213.000|20110114003215.000|TR0|our book. Because I think it's absolutely 
20110114003215.000|20110114003218.000|TR0|imperative.  What President Obama, his 
20110114003218.000|20110114003220.000|TR0|beautiful words last night when he said 
20110114003220.000|20110114003223.000|TR0|that Christina Green had hopes, high 
20110114003223.000|20110114003225.000|TR0|expectations for our democracy, and we 
20110114003225.000|20110114003228.000|TR0|have to live up to those expectations and 
20110114003228.000|20110114003230.000|TR0|the expectations of our children.
20110114003230.000|20110114003233.000|TR0|
20110114003233.000|20110114003235.000|TR0|KING:  Let me ask you lastly as a symbolic 
20110114003235.000|20110114003238.000|TR0|gesture, one of your Democratic colleagues 
20110114003238.000|20110114003240.000|TR0|on the Senate side, Mark Udall, has 
20110114003240.000|20110114003243.000|TR0|proposed never mind the usual practice of 
20110114003243.000|20110114003245.000|TR0|the Republicans sit on this side of the 
20110114003245.000|20110114003248.000|TR0|House chamber, the Democrats sit on this 
20110114003248.000|20110114003250.000|TR0|side of the House chamber.  Let's all sit 
20110114003250.000|20110114003253.000|TR0|together.  Let's all sit together and 
20110114003253.000|20110114003255.000|TR0|listen to the president as a sign of 
20110114003255.000|20110114003257.000|TR0|respect and a sign of unity.  Good idea?
20110114003257.000|20110114003300.000|TR0|
20110114003300.000|20110114003302.000|TR0|SCHULTZ:  You know I've already -- I think 
20110114003302.000|20110114003305.000|TR0|it's a great idea. I've already been 
20110114003305.000|20110114003307.000|TR0|thinking of who I might ask to sit with me.
20110114003307.000|20110114003310.000|TR0|
20110114003310.000|20110114003312.000|TR0|KING:  Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman 
20110114003312.000|20110114003315.000|TR0|Schultz there -- when we come back, the 
20110114003315.000|20110114003317.000|TR0|Republican perspective from Jeff Flake of 
20110114003317.000|20110114003320.000|TR0|Arizona.  He was at Christina Martin's -- 
20110114003320.000|20110114003322.000|TR0|Christina Green's -- excuse me -- funeral 
20110114003322.000|20110114003325.000|TR0|today and at the memorial service last 
20110114003325.000|20110114003327.000|TR0|night.  We'll talk to Congressman Flake in 
20110114003327.000|20110114003330.000|TR0|just a minute.

20110114003337.000|20110114003340.000|TR0|KING:  Joining me now, Republican 
20110114003340.000|20110114003342.000|TR0|Congressman Jeff Flake of Arizona.  He was 
20110114003342.000|20110114003345.000|TR0|at last night's memorial service when the 
20110114003345.000|20110114003347.000|TR0|president spoke at the University of 
20110114003347.000|20110114003350.000|TR0|Arizona.  And he's just now back from the 
20110114003350.000|20110114003352.000|TR0|funeral of the youngest victim of this 
20110114003352.000|20110114003355.000|TR0|tragedy, Christina Green.
20110114003355.000|20110114003357.000|TR0|
20110114003357.000|20110114003400.000|TR0|Congressman, let's start there.  You have 
20110114003400.000|20110114003402.000|TR0|a congresswoman shot, a federal judge 
20110114003402.000|20110114003404.000|TR0|killed, the president leading the nation 
20110114003404.000|20110114003407.000|TR0|in tribute and reflection.  And yet this 
20110114003407.000|20110114003409.000|TR0|little girl in some ways has become the 
20110114003409.000|20110114003412.000|TR0|most unifying figure just because of the 
20110114003412.000|20110114003414.000|TR0|most horrible thought of a nine- year-old 
20110114003414.000|20110114003417.000|TR0|girl, who wanted to see what democracy 
20110114003417.000|20110114003419.000|TR0|looked like.  Her life snuffed out in this 
20110114003419.000|20110114003422.000|TR0|heinous rampage and her parents having to 
20110114003422.000|20110114003424.000|TR0|do what no parents should ever have to do. 
20110114003424.000|20110114003427.000|TR0| Tell us about the service today.
20110114003427.000|20110114003429.000|TR0|
20110114003429.000|20110114003432.000|TR0|REP. JEFF FLAKE (R) ARIZONA:  It was a 
20110114003432.000|20110114003434.000|TR0|beautiful service.  And as you mentioned, 
20110114003434.000|20110114003437.000|TR0|there is nothing tougher.  I cannot 
20110114003437.000|20110114003439.000|TR0|imagine.  I don't believe any of us that 
20110114003439.000|20110114003442.000|TR0|haven't gone through it can know what a 
20110114003442.000|20110114003444.000|TR0|parent must feel as they bury their child. 
20110114003444.000|20110114003447.000|TR0| And it was just a very difficult service 
20110114003447.000|20110114003449.000|TR0|in a way, but very beautiful, as well.
20110114003449.000|20110114003452.000|TR0|
20110114003452.000|20110114003454.000|TR0|KING:  When you see the community together 
20110114003454.000|20110114003457.000|TR0|as it is, I spoke a bit earlier to the New 
20110114003457.000|20110114003459.000|TR0|York City fireman who rushed down there, 
20110114003459.000|20110114003502.000|TR0|with the giant flag, and it is an 
20110114003502.000|20110114003504.000|TR0|incredibly sad moment.  I'm a parent of 
20110114003504.000|20110114003507.000|TR0|two children.  I can't fathom.  I can't 
20110114003507.000|20110114003509.000|TR0|wrap my mind around it.  And yet when you 
20110114003509.000|20110114003512.000|TR0|see the community rallying like that there 
20110114003512.000|20110114003514.000|TR0|is-it's a tough thing to say at the 
20110114003514.000|20110114003516.000|TR0|moment, but there is an upside, no?
20110114003516.000|20110114003519.000|TR0|
20110114003519.000|20110114003521.000|TR0|FLAKE: I can tell you being it at the 
20110114003521.000|20110114003524.000|TR0|memorial service last night and being in 
20110114003524.000|20110114003526.000|TR0|Tucson a bit this past week, it's been a 
20110114003526.000|20110114003529.000|TR0|community that's gone through a lot.  And 
20110114003529.000|20110114003531.000|TR0|to see the community rally together and to 
20110114003531.000|20110114003534.000|TR0|celebrate those who are recovering, and to 
20110114003534.000|20110114003536.000|TR0|honor those who gave their lives and those 
20110114003536.000|20110114003539.000|TR0|who risked their lives to save the others, 
20110114003539.000|20110114003541.000|TR0|it's just an incredible experience all the 
20110114003541.000|20110114003544.000|TR0|way around.  And for the say state of 
20110114003544.000|20110114003546.000|TR0|Arizona, I think the state certainly wants 
20110114003546.000|20110114003549.000|TR0|to people to remember all the heroism, and 
20110114003549.000|20110114003551.000|TR0|the good things rather than just one lone 
20110114003551.000|20110114003554.000|TR0|gunman.
20110114003554.000|20110114003556.000|TR0|
20110114003556.000|20110114003559.000|TR0|KING:  That is an excellent point you 
20110114003559.000|20110114003601.000|TR0|make.  I just flew back this morning after 
20110114003601.000|20110114003604.000|TR0|several days there.  And it's very raw in 
20110114003604.000|20110114003606.000|TR0|Tucson, as you, I'm sure have experienced. 
20110114003606.000|20110114003609.000|TR0| And people are mad on the one hand, and 
20110114003609.000|20110114003611.000|TR0|they are shocked on the other hand.
20110114003611.000|20110114003614.000|TR0|
20110114003614.000|20110114003616.000|TR0|And the memorial service last night, 
20110114003616.000|20110114003619.000|TR0|everyone I spoke to found uplifting.  And 
20110114003619.000|20110114003621.000|TR0|I want you to listen to a little bit what 
20110114003621.000|20110114003624.000|TR0|the president said.  And we'll talk about 
20110114003624.000|20110114003626.000|TR0|it because you understand, you're coming 
20110114003626.000|20110114003628.000|TR0|back to work next week, and people will 
20110114003628.000|20110114003631.000|TR0|question will it be any different?  Let's 
20110114003631.000|20110114003633.000|TR0|listen to the president.
20110114003633.000|20110114003636.000|TR0|

20110114003643.000|20110114003646.000|TR0|STATES:  At a time when we are far too 
20110114003646.000|20110114003648.000|TR0|eager to lay the blame for all that ails 
20110114003648.000|20110114003651.000|TR0|the world at the feet of those who happen 
20110114003651.000|20110114003653.000|TR0|to think differently than we do. It's 
20110114003653.000|20110114003656.000|TR0|important for us to pause for a moment and 
20110114003656.000|20110114003658.000|TR0|make sure that we're talking with each 
20110114003658.000|20110114003701.000|TR0|other in a way that heals, not in a way 
20110114003701.000|20110114003703.000|TR0|that wounds.

20110114003713.000|20110114003716.000|TR0|Congressman?  As you know, you delayed the 
20110114003716.000|20110114003718.000|TR0|health care repeal vote this year, it was 
20110114003718.000|20110114003721.000|TR0|the right choice by your leadership, they 
20110114003721.000|20110114003723.000|TR0|will bring it up next week.  I think 
20110114003723.000|20110114003726.000|TR0|everybody think everybody has to get back 
20110114003726.000|20110114003728.000|TR0|to business.  You just heard your 
20110114003728.000|20110114003731.000|TR0|Democratic colleague Debbie Larson Schultz 
20110114003731.000|20110114003733.000|TR0|saying she is, you know, she is determined 
20110114003733.000|20110114003735.000|TR0|to fight your effort to the repeal, but 
20110114003735.000|20110114003738.000|TR0|she hopes that she, herself, will do it in 
20110114003738.000|20110114003740.000|TR0|a more civil way.  Will we?
20110114003740.000|20110114003743.000|TR0|
20110114003743.000|20110114003745.000|TR0|FLAKE: Right.  Well, let me just say first 
20110114003745.000|20110114003748.000|TR0|that I told the president after the speech 
20110114003748.000|20110114003750.000|TR0|that he's given a lot of good speeches, 
20110114003750.000|20110114003753.000|TR0|but none better than last night.  It was 
20110114003753.000|20110114003755.000|TR0|just exactly what I think we needed to 
20110114003755.000|20110114003758.000|TR0|hear and I've seen things in the last 
20110114003758.000|20110114003800.000|TR0|couple of days that I didn't think I'd see 
20110114003800.000|20110114003803.000|TR0|in Congress.  To have a bipartisan 
20110114003803.000|20110114003805.000|TR0|conference call, where you don't have 
20110114003805.000|20110114003808.000|TR0|either side jockeying for a political 
20110114003808.000|20110114003810.000|TR0|advantage, and the same on the House 
20110114003810.000|20110114003813.000|TR0|floor.  And when we get to the health care 
20110114003813.000|20110114003815.000|TR0|debate and other things, those are items 
20110114003815.000|20110114003818.000|TR0|that there should be debate on.  And there 
20110114003818.000|20110114003820.000|TR0|might even need to be partisan debate.  
20110114003820.000|20110114003823.000|TR0|But I think that all of us, myself 
20110114003823.000|20110114003825.000|TR0|included, and others, want to go into this 
20110114003825.000|20110114003828.000|TR0|next week and into the future with a 
20110114003828.000|20110114003830.000|TR0|renewed commitment to more civility and 
20110114003830.000|20110114003833.000|TR0|more civil tone.
20110114003833.000|20110114003835.000|TR0|
20110114003835.000|20110114003838.000|TR0|KING:  And our leaders are being watched 
20110114003838.000|20110114003840.000|TR0|at this moment.  You have a Republican 
20110114003840.000|20110114003843.000|TR0|congressman right here applauding the 
20110114003843.000|20110114003845.000|TR0|Democratic president of the United States; 
20110114003845.000|20110114003847.000|TR0|doesn't happen that often in our politics 
20110114003847.000|20110114003850.000|TR0|this day.  You had a there last night 
20110114003850.000|20110114003852.000|TR0|Senator McCain cut short an overseas trip, 
20110114003852.000|20110114003855.000|TR0|or his trip to South America to come home. 
20110114003855.000|20110114003857.000|TR0|The state leadership was there, a lot of 
20110114003857.000|20110114003900.000|TR0|national leadership was there.  The new 
20110114003900.000|20110114003902.000|TR0|speaker of the House, your leader, John 
20110114003902.000|20110114003905.000|TR0|Boehner, did not make the trip.  And he 
20110114003905.000|20110114003907.000|TR0|was at a political event here in 
20110114003907.000|20110114003910.000|TR0|Washington.  Do you think that was the 
20110114003910.000|20110114003912.000|TR0|right call?
20110114003912.000|20110114003915.000|TR0|
20110114003915.000|20110114003917.000|TR0|FLAKE: Well, let me say that the Arizona 
20110114003917.000|20110114003920.000|TR0|delegation, some of us have been scheduled 
20110114003920.000|20110114003922.000|TR0|to take part in the memorial service held 
20110114003922.000|20110114003925.000|TR0|on Capitol Hill and we felt badly at 
20110114003925.000|20110114003927.000|TR0|having missed that.  And the speaker felt 
20110114003927.000|20110114003930.000|TR0|that he should stay for that, and I think 
20110114003930.000|20110114003932.000|TR0|that that was appropriate.  That was 
20110114003932.000|20110114003935.000|TR0|already scheduled and he did a great job 
20110114003935.000|20110114003937.000|TR0|on the floor prior to that, and in that 
20110114003937.000|20110114003940.000|TR0|service.  So I don't think anyone should 
20110114003940.000|20110114003942.000|TR0|fault him for staying in Washington.
20110114003942.000|20110114003945.000|TR0|
20110114003945.000|20110114003947.000|TR0|KING:  Jeff Flake, Republican congressman 
20110114003947.000|20110114003950.000|TR0|from Arizona.  Sir, it's been a tough few 
20110114003950.000|20110114003952.000|TR0|days.  And a tough few days, we appreciate 
20110114003952.000|20110114003954.000|TR0|your time tonight.
20110114003954.000|20110114003957.000|TR0|
20110114003957.000|20110114003959.000|TR0|FLAKE: Thank you.
20110114003959.000|20110114004002.000|TR0|
20110114004002.000|20110114004004.000|TR0|KING:  Thank you. Take care, Sir.

20110114004007.000|20110114004009.000|TR0|When we come back, a veteran criminal 
20110114004009.000|20110114004012.000|TR0|profiler takes us inside the 
20110114004012.000|20110114004014.000|TR0|investigation.  Her perspective on what 
20110114004014.000|20110114004017.000|TR0|might have motivated this assassin just 
20110114004017.000|20110114004019.000|TR0|ahead.
20110114004019.000|20110114004022.000|TR0|

20110114004027.000|20110114004029.000|TR0|KING:  A pair of troubling questions keep 
20110114004029.000|20110114004032.000|TR0|getting bigger as we learn more about the 
20110114004032.000|20110114004034.000|TR0|suspect, Jared Lee Loughner's past.  What 
20110114004034.000|20110114004037.000|TR0|happened and why?  With us now former FBI 
20110114004037.000|20110114004039.000|TR0|criminal profiler Candice Delong.  She 
20110114004039.000|20110114004042.000|TR0|also has served as the head psychiatric 
20110114004042.000|20110114004044.000|TR0|nurse at Northwestern University.
20110114004044.000|20110114004047.000|TR0|
20110114004047.000|20110114004049.000|TR0|Ms. Delong, thanks for joining us.
20110114004049.000|20110114004052.000|TR0|
20110114004052.000|20110114004054.000|TR0|CANDICE DELONG, FMR. FBI CRIMINAL 
20110114004054.000|20110114004057.000|TR0|PROFILER: You're welcome.
20110114004057.000|20110114004059.000|TR0|
20110114004059.000|20110114004102.000|TR0|KING:  From everything you've seen, 
20110114004102.000|20110114004104.000|TR0|everything you've read, everything you've 
20110114004104.000|20110114004106.000|TR0|heard, when you overlap that with your 
20110114004106.000|20110114004109.000|TR0|experience, who is Jared Lee Loughner?
20110114004109.000|20110114004111.000|TR0|
20110114004111.000|20110114004114.000|TR0|DELONG:  It sounds to me as if Jared Lee 
20110114004114.000|20110114004116.000|TR0|Loughner is probably someone suffering 
20110114004116.000|20110114004119.000|TR0|from a major psychiatric disorder known as 
20110114004119.000|20110114004121.000|TR0|schizophrenia.  This is not multiple 
20110114004121.000|20110114004124.000|TR0|personality.  This is a condition wherein 
20110114004124.000|20110114004126.000|TR0|the individual may hear voices, but is 
20110114004126.000|20110114004129.000|TR0|frequently guided by delusion.  They have 
20110114004129.000|20110114004131.000|TR0|a thought disorder.  They misperceive 
20110114004131.000|20110114004134.000|TR0|things. They may see two strangers talking 
20110114004134.000|20110114004136.000|TR0|across the street and instantly think that 
20110114004136.000|20110114004139.000|TR0|those people are talking to them.  They 
20110114004139.000|20110114004141.000|TR0|may see you on the TV and think that you 
20110114004141.000|20110114004144.000|TR0|are speaking directly to him.  They don't 
20110114004144.000|20110114004146.000|TR0|perceive things right and they frequently 
20110114004146.000|20110114004149.000|TR0|feel threatened by their surroundings and 
20110114004149.000|20110114004151.000|TR0|threatened by others.  It appears to me 
20110114004151.000|20110114004154.000|TR0|that may be at the root of what Mr. 
20110114004154.000|20110114004156.000|TR0|Loughner's problems are.
20110114004156.000|20110114004159.000|TR0|
20110114004159.000|20110114004201.000|TR0|KING:  And if he is who you believe him to 
20110114004201.000|20110114004204.000|TR0|be, by your estimation, what is he 
20110114004204.000|20110114004206.000|TR0|thinking now as he sits in federal prison?
20110114004206.000|20110114004209.000|TR0|
20110114004209.000|20110114004211.000|TR0|DELONG:  Well, the thing about 
20110114004211.000|20110114004214.000|TR0|schizophrenia and delusions, which a 
20110114004214.000|20110114004216.000|TR0|delusion is a strong belief and an idea 
20110114004216.000|20110114004218.000|TR0|that has no basis in concept, it appears 
20110114004218.000|20110114004221.000|TR0|that he was threatened by the 
20110114004221.000|20110114004223.000|TR0|congresswoman.  That he -- I'm guessing he 
20110114004223.000|20110114004226.000|TR0|took a shot at her, tried to kill her, 
20110114004226.000|20110114004228.000|TR0|because he believed she was dangerous, at 
20110114004228.000|20110114004231.000|TR0|least dangerous to him.  The fact that he 
20110114004231.000|20110114004233.000|TR0|was apprehended and he's been in jail for 
20110114004233.000|20110114004236.000|TR0|five days hasn't taught him a lesson.  He 
20110114004236.000|20110114004238.000|TR0|can't be talked out of delusions.  People 
20110114004238.000|20110114004241.000|TR0|suffering in the grips of schizophrenia 
20110114004241.000|20110114004243.000|TR0|are irrational, and unreasonable, so he's 
20110114004243.000|20110114004246.000|TR0|probably still thinking, she is still a 
20110114004246.000|20110114004248.000|TR0|danger.
20110114004248.000|20110114004251.000|TR0|
20110114004251.000|20110114004253.000|TR0|KING:  And does he compare to others?  
20110114004253.000|20110114004256.000|TR0|You're basing your assumptions here, your 
20110114004256.000|20110114004258.000|TR0|estimations, based on your own experience 
20110114004258.000|20110114004301.000|TR0|in other cases you've studied.  Put him 
20110114004301.000|20110114004303.000|TR0|into context for us.  Put this crime into 
20110114004303.000|20110114004306.000|TR0|context.
20110114004306.000|20110114004308.000|TR0|
20110114004308.000|20110114004311.000|TR0|DELONG:  Well, this is a very serious 
20110114004311.000|20110114004313.000|TR0|crime, the vast majority of people with 
20110114004313.000|20110114004316.000|TR0|schizophrenia and it's approximately 1 to 
20110114004316.000|20110114004318.000|TR0|2 percent  of the population, never hurt 
20110114004318.000|20110114004321.000|TR0|anyone except themselves.  They don't want 
20110114004321.000|20110114004323.000|TR0|to be around other people.  They don't 
20110114004323.000|20110114004325.000|TR0|like talking to other people. Of the 
20110114004325.000|20110114004328.000|TR0|millions of homeless people in this 
20110114004328.000|20110114004330.000|TR0|country, approximately 50 percent of them 
20110114004330.000|20110114004333.000|TR0|suffer from a serious mental illness such 
20110114004333.000|20110114004335.000|TR0|as this, but they're not the people on the 
20110114004335.000|20110114004338.000|TR0|street going up to you and even asking for 
20110114004338.000|20110114004340.000|TR0|spare change.  They don't want interaction 
20110114004340.000|20110114004343.000|TR0|with people.  So if Jared is suffering 
20110114004343.000|20110114004345.000|TR0|from schizophrenia, the fact that he did 
20110114004345.000|20110114004348.000|TR0|this is unusual.  It's rare.  Sadly, 
20110114004348.000|20110114004350.000|TR0|however, though John, when a schizophrenic 
20110114004350.000|20110114004353.000|TR0|does become violent, it usually makes 
20110114004353.000|20110114004355.000|TR0|headlines like this.
20110114004355.000|20110114004358.000|TR0|
20110114004358.000|20110114004400.000|TR0|KING:  And so what are the signs?  I have 
20110114004400.000|20110114004403.000|TR0|in front of me a bunch of reports.  Let's 
20110114004403.000|20110114004405.000|TR0|start here.  From Pima Community College, 
20110114004405.000|20110114004408.000|TR0|Department of Public Safety, teachers, 
20110114004408.000|20110114004410.000|TR0|fellow students did not want him in the 
20110114004410.000|20110114004413.000|TR0|classroom.  They felt he was bizarre and 
20110114004413.000|20110114004415.000|TR0|in some cases threatening.  Here is from 
20110114004415.000|20110114004418.000|TR0|one of the reports. Teacher had said 
20110114004418.000|20110114004420.000|TR0|Loughner made comments in the class after 
20110114004420.000|20110114004423.000|TR0|the poem that were a huge leap from the 
20110114004423.000|20110114004425.000|TR0|context of the poem, said things about 
20110114004425.000|20110114004428.000|TR0|abortion, wars, killing people and why 
20110114004428.000|20110114004430.000|TR0|don't we just strap bombs to babies.  
20110114004430.000|20110114004433.000|TR0|Loughner has a dark personality and it is 
20110114004433.000|20110114004435.000|TR0|creepy.  They have resolved to keep an eye 
20110114004435.000|20110114004437.000|TR0|on him.
20110114004437.000|20110114004440.000|TR0|
20110114004440.000|20110114004442.000|TR0|Arizona has a law in which you can 
20110114004442.000|20110114004445.000|TR0|petition to force somebody to get a mental 
20110114004445.000|20110114004447.000|TR0|health evaluation.  Do things like that in 
20110114004447.000|20110114004450.000|TR0|these reports, is that enough to meet the 
20110114004450.000|20110114004452.000|TR0|test in your view?
20110114004452.000|20110114004455.000|TR0|
20110114004455.000|20110114004457.000|TR0|DELONG:  Yes, absolutely.  One of your 
20110114004457.000|20110114004500.000|TR0|earlier guests said, and this may be the 
20110114004500.000|20110114004502.000|TR0|case with Arizona, but, it's not the case 
20110114004502.000|20110114004505.000|TR0|in other places where I've worked, in 
20110114004505.000|20110114004507.000|TR0|Illinois and currently in California, or 
20110114004507.000|20110114004510.000|TR0|that I'm aware of, their psychiatric laws. 
20110114004510.000|20110114004512.000|TR0| They can be -- a person can be evaluated, 
20110114004512.000|20110114004515.000|TR0|can be picked up by the police and brought 
20110114004515.000|20110114004517.000|TR0|into a county psychiatric facility and 
20110114004517.000|20110114004520.000|TR0|evaluated by a psychiatrist, who may find 
20110114004520.000|20110114004522.000|TR0|them to be in need of mental health 
20110114004522.000|20110114004525.000|TR0|treatment, and can hold them against -- 
20110114004525.000|20110114004527.000|TR0|it's called an involuntary commitment for 
20110114004527.000|20110114004530.000|TR0|72 hours, if they are suicidal, homicidal 
20110114004530.000|20110114004532.000|TR0|or gravely disabled as a result of their 
20110114004532.000|20110114004535.000|TR0|mental illness.  Someone hearing voices, 
20110114004535.000|20110114004537.000|TR0|delusional, talking about blowing up 
20110114004537.000|20110114004540.000|TR0|babies with bombs and what not, might have 
20110114004540.000|20110114004542.000|TR0|been considered by psychiatrists to be 
20110114004542.000|20110114004545.000|TR0|gravely disabled at that moment and could 
20110114004545.000|20110114004547.000|TR0|have been held for a minimum of 72 hours.  
20110114004547.000|20110114004549.000|TR0|If they're deemed after 72 hours by this 
20110114004549.000|20110114004552.000|TR0|the psychiatrist to still need treatment, 
20110114004552.000|20110114004554.000|TR0|then they may have a hearing in front of a 
20110114004554.000|20110114004557.000|TR0|judge who would decide if they stay for 
20110114004557.000|20110114004559.000|TR0|two more weeks.
20110114004559.000|20110114004602.000|TR0|
20110114004602.000|20110114004604.000|TR0|KING:  And when you look at cases in the 
20110114004604.000|20110114004607.000|TR0|past, is this consistent or inconsistent?  
20110114004607.000|20110114004609.000|TR0|And the question is this, the police say 
20110114004609.000|20110114004612.000|TR0|when they finally searched his house, they 
20110114004612.000|20110114004614.000|TR0|found a lockbox in his bedroom that had a 
20110114004614.000|20110114004617.000|TR0|form letter the congresswoman had sent, 
20110114004617.000|20110114004619.000|TR0|talking about an event he had been at in 
20110114004619.000|20110114004622.000|TR0|the past.  And some scribbles an envelope, 
20110114004622.000|20110114004624.000|TR0|die bitch, die pigs, reference to cops, 
20110114004624.000|20110114004627.000|TR0|but not a big diary, not a lot of news 
20110114004627.000|20110114004629.000|TR0|clippings, just a couple of things.  Not 
20110114004629.000|20110114004632.000|TR0|somebody who is obsessing to the point 
20110114004632.000|20110114004634.000|TR0|that they're collecting all these things.
20110114004634.000|20110114004637.000|TR0|
20110114004637.000|20110114004639.000|TR0|DELONG:  Well, what was probably going on, 
20110114004639.000|20110114004642.000|TR0|and certainly what we certainly know now 
20110114004642.000|20110114004644.000|TR0|after the events of last Saturday, the 
20110114004644.000|20110114004647.000|TR0|approach earlier that he had months 
20110114004647.000|20110114004649.000|TR0|before, probably is what we know in law 
20110114004649.000|20110114004652.000|TR0|enforcement and profiling and this kind of 
20110114004652.000|20110114004654.000|TR0|analysis as a nonlethal approach.  He 
20110114004654.000|20110114004656.000|TR0|approached her -- he probably had a gun 
20110114004656.000|20110114004659.000|TR0|with him at the time -- to see how close 
20110114004659.000|20110114004701.000|TR0|he could get to her.  A true political 
20110114004701.000|20110114004704.000|TR0|assassin would not have scribblings, 
20110114004704.000|20110114004706.000|TR0|writings, would not tell anyone. In this 
20110114004706.000|20110114004709.000|TR0|particular case, Mr. Loughner's mental 
20110114004709.000|20110114004711.000|TR0|illness was guiding him.  And that 
20110114004711.000|20110114004714.000|TR0|probably-I mean, he had moments of hate, 
20110114004714.000|20110114004716.000|TR0|moments of -- he's probably told someone 
20110114004716.000|20110114004719.000|TR0|what was in his head and why he believes 
20110114004719.000|20110114004721.000|TR0|he was justified in what he did.  His 
20110114004721.000|20110114004724.000|TR0|reasons make perfect sense to him.

20110114004804.000|20110114004806.000|TR0|of a child; undimmed by the cynicism or 
20110114004806.000|20110114004808.000|TR0|vitriol that we adults all too often just 
20110114004808.000|20110114004811.000|TR0|take for granted.  I want to live up to

20110114004823.000|20110114004826.000|TR0|talking last night about nine-year-old 
20110114004826.000|20110114004828.000|TR0|Christina Green.  Funeral service for her 
20110114004828.000|20110114004831.000|TR0|today. Will we?  Will we live up to her 
20110114004831.000|20110114004833.000|TR0|expectations?  Let's have a conversation 
20110114004833.000|20110114004836.000|TR0|with Erick Erickson our contributor and 
20110114004836.000|20110114004838.000|TR0|the editor of ConservativeRedState.com.

20110114004843.000|20110114004846.000|TR0|Let me start with you Cornell.  You are in 
20110114004846.000|20110114004848.000|TR0|the room.  Will we? Will it get-or will we 
20110114004848.000|20110114004851.000|TR0|in 72 or 172 hours be back to screaming at 
20110114004851.000|20110114004853.000|TR0|each other and calling each other jerks.

20110114004856.000|20110114004858.000|TR0|CONTRIBUTOR:  I'd like to hope so. 
20110114004858.000|20110114004901.000|TR0|However, I've been in this town long 
20110114004901.000|20110114004903.000|TR0|enough to know that it is tough. Here is 
20110114004903.000|20110114004906.000|TR0|the problem:  If the American people 
20110114004906.000|20110114004908.000|TR0|demand I think it will change.  If the 
20110114004908.000|20110114004911.000|TR0|middle swath of Americans demand it, and 
20110114004911.000|20110114004913.000|TR0|they reward the politicians for it, which 
20110114004913.000|20110114004916.000|TR0|I think they will, I think that some of 
20110114004916.000|20110114004918.000|TR0|the numbers coming out right now say that 
20110114004918.000|20110114004920.000|TR0|they will.  They will force the 
20110114004920.000|20110114004923.000|TR0|politicians to change.  But right now, 
20110114004923.000|20110114004925.000|TR0|unless the American people are demanding 
20110114004925.000|20110114004928.000|TR0|that they change it will be hard to change.

20110114004933.000|20110114004935.000|TR0|the point I like to make, and we made it a 
20110114004935.000|20110114004938.000|TR0|long time ago when you agreed to enjoy 
20110114004938.000|20110114004940.000|TR0|this network and come on the program, 
20110114004940.000|20110114004943.000|TR0|there are great ideas to fight about, 
20110114004943.000|20110114004945.000|TR0|there are great debates to have about the 
20110114004945.000|20110114004948.000|TR0|size of government, and spending, and 
20110114004948.000|20110114004950.000|TR0|taxes, and healthcare and the role and 
20110114004950.000|20110114004953.000|TR0|reach of government, and schools, and 
20110114004953.000|20110114004955.000|TR0|everything else across the spectrum.  We 
20110114004955.000|20110114004958.000|TR0|can have them without saying well, I 
20110114004958.000|20110114005000.000|TR0|disagree with you that means you are 
20110114005000.000|20110114005003.000|TR0|un-American, or you don't love your 
20110114005003.000|20110114005005.000|TR0|country?  Can't we?

20110114005010.000|20110114005013.000|TR0| I would hope so.  I was somewhat 
20110114005013.000|20110114005015.000|TR0|disappointed reading the transcript of the 
20110114005015.000|20110114005018.000|TR0|White House press conference with Gibbs 
20110114005018.000|20110114005020.000|TR0|and the number of reporters trying to get 
20110114005020.000|20110114005023.000|TR0|him to engage in the blame game.  And you 
20110114005023.000|20110114005025.000|TR0|know it is not just the politicians it is 
20110114005025.000|20110114005027.000|TR0|all around.  It will have to be the press, 
20110114005027.000|20110114005030.000|TR0|American people, everyone participating 
20110114005030.000|20110114005032.000|TR0|and trying to change the tone-if it is to

20110114005040.000|20110114005042.000|TR0|some of the back and forth at the White 
20110114005042.000|20110114005045.000|TR0|House briefing, with reporters trying to 
20110114005045.000|20110114005047.000|TR0|see if the president had anybody in mind, 
20110114005047.000|20110114005050.000|TR0|when he said certain things.  And this is 
20110114005050.000|20110114005052.000|TR0|one of the things they were asking about.  
20110114005052.000|20110114005055.000|TR0|Let's listen.

20110114005127.000|20110114005130.000|TR0|minute.  I wanted to play a little bit 
20110114005130.000|20110114005132.000|TR0|more from the president's speech last 
20110114005132.000|20110114005135.000|TR0|night.  This is what reporters were 
20110114005135.000|20110114005137.000|TR0|asking, who did the president have in mind 
20110114005137.000|20110114005139.000|TR0|when he said this?

20110114005219.000|20110114005222.000|TR0|more from people on the right, who might 
20110114005222.000|20110114005224.000|TR0|have been trying to stir something up, but 
20110114005224.000|20110114005227.000|TR0|politely.  Saying, look, the people who 
20110114005227.000|20110114005229.000|TR0|were playing blame, or those who 
20110114005229.000|20110114005232.000|TR0|were-whether it was pointing to the Sarah 
20110114005232.000|20110114005234.000|TR0|Palin Web postings or other things.  Was 
20110114005234.000|20110114005237.000|TR0|the president there, delivering a message 
20110114005237.000|20110114005239.000|TR0|to the left saying back off?

20110114005242.000|20110114005244.000|TR0|BELCHER:  I think he was delivering, he 
20110114005244.000|20110114005247.000|TR0|delivered a message to the country, which 
20110114005247.000|20110114005249.000|TR0|he has to do as the leader of the country, 
20110114005249.000|20110114005251.000|TR0|he was delivering a message to the 
20110114005251.000|20110114005254.000|TR0|country.  The other thing he said, no one 
20110114005254.000|20110114005256.000|TR0|can know what triggered this.  He was 
20110114005256.000|20110114005259.000|TR0|speaking directly to us saying bring this 
20110114005259.000|20110114005301.000|TR0|down, let's move forward.  He was-he was a 
20110114005301.000|20110114005304.000|TR0|leader last night.  And it was one of his 
20110114005304.000|20110114005306.000|TR0|finest performances.

20110114005314.000|20110114005316.000|TR0|ERICKSON:  You know I think that was 
20110114005316.000|20110114005319.000|TR0|probably the best speech he has given as 
20110114005319.000|20110114005321.000|TR0|president.  It really was a tremendous 
20110114005321.000|20110114005324.000|TR0|speech.  The genius of those paragraphs 
20110114005324.000|20110114005326.000|TR0|there is the left can say he was talking 
20110114005326.000|20110114005329.000|TR0|to the right.  Right can say he was 
20110114005329.000|20110114005331.000|TR0|talking to the left.  Overall he was 
20110114005331.000|20110114005334.000|TR0|talking to everyone.  As I have said all 
20110114005334.000|20110114005336.000|TR0|week, the blame game and did political 
20110114005336.000|20110114005339.000|TR0|rhetoric cause this, and all, we have got 
20110114005339.000|20110114005341.000|TR0|six people dead in Arizona.  And it's just 
20110114005341.000|20110114005344.000|TR0|been a distraction all week and I'm glad 
20110114005344.000|20110114005346.000|TR0|he said it.
20110114005346.000|20110114005349.000|TR0|
20110114005349.000|20110114005351.000|TR0|KING:  Amen.  We will end on that point.  
20110114005351.000|20110114005354.000|TR0|We will see, when we are here next week 
20110114005354.000|20110114005356.000|TR0|and we're talking about the efforts to 
20110114005356.000|20110114005358.000|TR0|repeal healthcare in the House, let's see 
20110114005358.000|20110114005401.000|TR0|how we handle ourselves, and lets see how 
20110114005401.000|20110114005403.000|TR0|the politicians handle themselves.  Maybe 
20110114005403.000|20110114005406.000|TR0|we can have a fierce, partisan, feisty 
20110114005406.000|20110114005408.000|TR0|debate that is not so personal and 
20110114005408.000|20110114005411.000|TR0|vitriolic. Eric and Cornell, appreciate 
20110114005411.000|20110114005413.000|TR0|your time tonight.

20110114005441.000|20110114005443.000|TR0|they passed under a U.S. flag recovered at

20110114005448.000|20110114005451.000|TR0|Christina was born that very day.  A short 
20110114005451.000|20110114005453.000|TR0|time ago I asked New York City firefighter 
20110114005453.000|20110114005456.000|TR0|Jimmy Sands, who brought the flag to 
20110114005456.000|20110114005458.000|TR0|Tucson, what Christina's parents told him.

20110114005508.000|20110114005510.000|TR0|meant a lot to them. That was pretty much 
20110114005510.000|20110114005513.000|TR0|the extent of our small conversation.  
20110114005513.000|20110114005515.000|TR0|They were definitely overwhelmed with all 
20110114005515.000|20110114005518.000|TR0|of the people that came out today.  It was 
20110114005518.000|20110114005520.000|TR0|a beautiful ceremony and we are just very 
20110114005520.000|20110114005523.000|TR0|happy to -- to give them a little

20110114005533.000|20110114005535.000|TR0|it means to you, and what you think it 
20110114005535.000|20110114005538.000|TR0|should mean, not only to the people of 
20110114005538.000|20110114005540.000|TR0|Tucson tonight, but to the country?       
20110114005540.000|20110114005543.000|TR0|SANDS:  Basically it is a symbol of our 
20110114005543.000|20110114005545.000|TR0|rebuilding, turning a tragedy into 
20110114005545.000|20110114005548.000|TR0|something positive.  The flag is 20 by 30, 
20110114005548.000|20110114005550.000|TR0|and it is being stitched back together.  
20110114005550.000|20110114005553.000|TR0|And when it is completed it will be

20110114005605.000|20110114005608.000|TR0|only from Christina's parents, but others 
20110114005608.000|20110114005610.000|TR0|about the significance of seeing that

20110114005618.000|20110114005620.000|TR0|SANDS:  It was very emotional.  Everybody 
20110114005620.000|20110114005622.000|TR0|was saying thank you. They were -- they 
20110114005622.000|20110114005625.000|TR0|were very happy that we were able to bring

20110114005657.000|20110114005700.000|TR0|been a time of reflection.  I know you 
20110114005700.000|20110114005702.000|TR0|were struck last night as a parent, by the

20110114005705.000|20110114005707.000|TR0|speech, he was speaking much more as 
20110114005707.000|20110114005710.000|TR0|parent of two daughters than the president 
20110114005710.000|20110114005712.000|TR0|of 309 million people.

20110114005715.000|20110114005717.000|TR0|PETE DOMINICK, CNN OFFBEAT REPORTER:  
20110114005717.000|20110114005720.000|TR0|That's right, John King.
20110114005720.000|20110114005722.000|TR0|
20110114005722.000|20110114005725.000|TR0|Not only did he speak as a parent, I think 
20110114005725.000|20110114005727.000|TR0|he spoke as a son, when he thought about 
20110114005727.000|20110114005729.000|TR0|losing his mom.  He spoke as a husband, I 
20110114005729.000|20110114005732.000|TR0|think, you know, looking down at his wife. 
20110114005732.000|20110114005734.000|TR0| And, yes, he spoke most importantly as a 
20110114005734.000|20110114005737.000|TR0|parent.  Last night the president I think, 
20110114005737.000|20110114005739.000|TR0|he wasn't only the president.  He was an 
20110114005739.000|20110114005742.000|TR0|American, he was a parent.
20110114005742.000|20110114005744.000|TR0|
20110114005744.000|20110114005747.000|TR0|My wife walked out after putting our 
20110114005747.000|20110114005749.000|TR0|little girls to bed, I was just 
20110114005749.000|20110114005752.000|TR0|waterworks, crying.  She said, what's 
20110114005752.000|20110114005754.000|TR0|wrong?  The president is talking about 
20110114005754.000|20110114005757.000|TR0|this little girl.  We think about our 
20110114005757.000|20110114005759.000|TR0|little girls.  It was really poignant, 
20110114005759.000|20110114005802.000|TR0|really touching.  I thought the president 
20110114005802.000|20110114005804.000|TR0|did a great job.
20110114005804.000|20110114005807.000|TR0|
20110114005807.000|20110114005809.000|TR0|John, I think you did a great job out 
20110114005809.000|20110114005812.000|TR0|there as well.  I am happy you were out 
20110114005812.000|20110114005814.000|TR0|there, because you were able to tell us 
20110114005814.000|20110114005817.000|TR0|and our viewers the energy out there.  
20110114005817.000|20110114005819.000|TR0|Last night you said these people needed 
20110114005819.000|20110114005822.000|TR0|something to celebrate.  They have been 
20110114005822.000|20110114005824.000|TR0|mourning for days.  What was it like that 
20110114005824.000|20110114005827.000|TR0|energy out there being in that community?
20110114005827.000|20110114005829.000|TR0|
20110114005829.000|20110114005832.000|TR0|KING:  Well it was, sad to make the trip, 
20110114005832.000|20110114005834.000|TR0|Pete.  But I am a reporter, I am a 
20110114005834.000|20110114005837.000|TR0|reporter, I am a report.  This anchor 
20110114005837.000|20110114005839.000|TR0|thing is sometimes still new to me in the 
20110114005839.000|20110114005841.000|TR0|sense you are sometimes forced inside a 
20110114005841.000|20110114005844.000|TR0|studio.  I say that with no disrespect.  
20110114005844.000|20110114005846.000|TR0|When something like this happens, you are 
20110114005846.000|20110114005849.000|TR0|saddened, but you want to go there to see 
20110114005849.000|20110114005851.000|TR0|it and feel it.  To the point, I think it 
20110114005851.000|20110114005854.000|TR0|was hard if you were just listening at 
20110114005854.000|20110114005856.000|TR0|home and you hadn't been to Tucson, to 
20110114005856.000|20110114005859.000|TR0|hear the laughter, cheering and all the 
20110114005859.000|20110114005901.000|TR0|applause and what looked like a 
20110114005901.000|20110114005904.000|TR0|celebration.  The town had been in shock 
20110114005904.000|20110114005906.000|TR0|for days, and crying for days, they were 
20110114005906.000|20110114005909.000|TR0|celebrating the first responders, the 
20110114005909.000|20110114005911.000|TR0|doctors, and everybody else.  It was quite 
20110114005911.000|20110114005914.000|TR0|moving.
20110114005914.000|20110114005916.000|TR0|
20110114005916.000|20110114005919.000|TR0|Pete, we will see you tomorrow.
20110114005919.000|20110114005921.000|TR0|
20110114005921.000|20110114005924.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Tomorrow, we'll have a good 
20110114005924.000|20110114005926.000|TR0|time.
20110114005926.000|20110114005929.000|TR0|
20110114005929.000|20110114005931.000|TR0|KING:  We'll have time to laugh in the 
20110114005931.000|20110114005934.000|TR0|days ahead.
20110114005934.000|20110114005936.000|TR0|
20110114005936.000|20110114005939.000|TR0|That's all for us tonight.  I am glad to 
20110114005939.000|20110114005941.000|TR0|be back.  I don't dislike my studio that 
20110114005941.000|20110114005944.000|TR0|much.  We'll see you right here tomorrow 
20110114005944.000|20110114005946.000|TR0|night. PARKER SPITZER starts right now.
