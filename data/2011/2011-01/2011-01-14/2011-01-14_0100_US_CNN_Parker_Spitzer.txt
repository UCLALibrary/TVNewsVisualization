20110114010007.000|20110114010009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR:  I am glad to be 
20110114010009.000|20110114010011.000|TR0|back.  I don't dislike my studio that 
20110114010011.000|20110114010013.000|TR0|much.  We'll see you right here tomorrow 
20110114010013.000|20110114010016.000|TR0|night.  "PARKER SPITZER" starts now.
20110114010016.000|20110114010018.000|TR0|
20110114010018.000|20110114010020.000|TR0|KATHLEEN PARKER, CNN ANCHOR:  Good 
20110114010020.000|20110114010022.000|TR0|evening, I am Kathleen Parker.
20110114010022.000|20110114010025.000|TR0|
20110114010025.000|20110114010027.000|TR0|ELIOT SPITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  And I'm Eliot 
20110114010027.000|20110114010029.000|TR0|Spitzer.  Welcome to the program.
20110114010029.000|20110114010031.000|TR0|
20110114010031.000|20110114010034.000|TR0|We begin tonight with the best possible 
20110114010034.000|20110114010036.000|TR0|news from the University Medical Center in 
20110114010036.000|20110114010038.000|TR0|Tucson.  Extraordinary progress for 
20110114010038.000|20110114010041.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.
20110114010041.000|20110114010043.000|TR0|
20110114010043.000|20110114010045.000|TR0|CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has spoken 
20110114010045.000|20110114010047.000|TR0|exclusively with the congresswoman's 
20110114010047.000|20110114010050.000|TR0|doctors and her husband.  Today they sat 
20110114010050.000|20110114010052.000|TR0|her up on the edge of the bed and she 
20110114010052.000|20110114010054.000|TR0|moved both her legs and wait until you 
20110114010054.000|20110114010056.000|TR0|hear what else she did.
20110114010056.000|20110114010059.000|TR0|
20110114010059.000|20110114010101.000|TR0|But first here are the questions we want 
20110114010101.000|20110114010103.000|TR0|to drill down on tonight.  Is it possible, 
20110114010103.000|20110114010106.000|TR0|could it happen, that Gabrielle Giffords 
20110114010106.000|20110114010108.000|TR0|has a full recovery?
20110114010108.000|20110114010110.000|TR0|
20110114010110.000|20110114010112.000|TR0|And then the ugly side of the story, chat 
20110114010112.000|20110114010115.000|TR0|room postings, describing rape and 
20110114010115.000|20110114010117.000|TR0|cannibalism, reveal the horrible and 
20110114010117.000|20110114010119.000|TR0|disturbing thoughts of Jared Loughner.  
20110114010119.000|20110114010121.000|TR0|The strangest ramblings yet, what do they 
20110114010121.000|20110114010124.000|TR0|tell us about whether or not he was insane.
20110114010124.000|20110114010126.000|TR0|
20110114010126.000|20110114010128.000|TR0|And then something you probably haven't 
20110114010128.000|20110114010130.000|TR0|heard about a second gun at the scene of 
20110114010130.000|20110114010133.000|TR0|the shooting and a near miss.  Just how 
20110114010133.000|20110114010135.000|TR0|close were we to a greater tragedy in 
20110114010135.000|20110114010137.000|TR0|Tucson?
20110114010137.000|20110114010140.000|TR0|
20110114010140.000|20110114010142.000|TR0|PARKER:  Meanwhile, authorities believe 
20110114010142.000|20110114010144.000|TR0|they've recovered another clue that links 
20110114010144.000|20110114010146.000|TR0|Jared Loughner to the shooting spree in 
20110114010146.000|20110114010149.000|TR0|Tucson.  A black bag containing several 
20110114010149.000|20110114010151.000|TR0|boxes of ammunition that matches the type 
20110114010151.000|20110114010153.000|TR0|used in the incident was found today by a 
20110114010153.000|20110114010155.000|TR0|teenager walking his dog very close to the 
20110114010155.000|20110114010158.000|TR0|Loughner home.
20110114010158.000|20110114010200.000|TR0|
20110114010200.000|20110114010202.000|TR0|Loughner's father Randy told police he saw 
20110114010202.000|20110114010205.000|TR0|his son carrying a bag on the morning of 
20110114010205.000|20110114010207.000|TR0|the shooting.  The father asked his son 
20110114010207.000|20110114010209.000|TR0|what he was doing, but Jared gave him only 
20110114010209.000|20110114010211.000|TR0|a mumbled response.
20110114010211.000|20110114010214.000|TR0|
20110114010214.000|20110114010216.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Earlier today Friends and family 
20110114010216.000|20110114010218.000|TR0|turned out for 9-year- old Christina 
20110114010218.000|20110114010220.000|TR0|Green's funeral service.       Christina 
20110114010220.000|20110114010223.000|TR0|of course was killed while attending 
20110114010223.000|20110114010225.000|TR0|Giffords' meet- and-greet Saturday.  As 
20110114010225.000|20110114010227.000|TR0|hundreds of mourners arrived at St. 
20110114010227.000|20110114010230.000|TR0|Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church, they 
20110114010230.000|20110114010232.000|TR0|passed under a giant American flag 
20110114010232.000|20110114010234.000|TR0|recovered in the aftermath of 9/11, the 
20110114010234.000|20110114010236.000|TR0|very day Christina was born.
20110114010236.000|20110114010239.000|TR0|
20110114010239.000|20110114010241.000|TR0|PARKER:  And as family and victims search 
20110114010241.000|20110114010243.000|TR0|for answers we've learned more details 
20110114010243.000|20110114010245.000|TR0|that offer a glimpse into Loughner's dark 
20110114010245.000|20110114010248.000|TR0|and disturbing mind.
20110114010248.000|20110114010250.000|TR0|
20110114010250.000|20110114010252.000|TR0|Randi Kaye joins us from Tucson with the 
20110114010252.000|20110114010254.000|TR0|latest.
20110114010254.000|20110114010257.000|TR0|
20110114010257.000|20110114010259.000|TR0|Hi, Randi.
20110114010259.000|20110114010301.000|TR0|
20110114010301.000|20110114010304.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110114010304.000|20110114010306.000|TR0|
20110114010306.000|20110114010308.000|TR0|PARKER:  Let me just start.  I'm sorry.  
20110114010308.000|20110114010310.000|TR0|Didn't mean to interrupt you.  But so much 
20110114010310.000|20110114010313.000|TR0|has been said about Loughner's writings 
20110114010313.000|20110114010315.000|TR0|and ramblings, and you've taken a closer 
20110114010315.000|20110114010317.000|TR0|look at some of that information. What can 
20110114010317.000|20110114010319.000|TR0|you tell us about what you've learned 
20110114010319.000|20110114010322.000|TR0|about his online writings and world he was 
20110114010322.000|20110114010324.000|TR0|living in?
20110114010324.000|20110114010326.000|TR0|
20110114010326.000|20110114010329.000|TR0|RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well I can 
20110114010329.000|20110114010331.000|TR0|tell you that we've learned that he was 
20110114010331.000|20110114010333.000|TR0|pretty obsessed with dreaming.  And not 
20110114010333.000|20110114010335.000|TR0|just any kind of dreaming, but lucid 
20110114010335.000|20110114010338.000|TR0|dreaming or what's called conscious 
20110114010338.000|20110114010340.000|TR0|dreaming where you actually feel like you 
20110114010340.000|20110114010342.000|TR0|are in the dream, you're aware that you're 
20110114010342.000|20110114010344.000|TR0|in the dream, but you also feel like you 
20110114010344.000|20110114010347.000|TR0|can manipulate the dream.  Sort of like 
20110114010347.000|20110114010349.000|TR0|that movie "Inception."
20110114010349.000|20110114010351.000|TR0|
20110114010351.000|20110114010353.000|TR0|And we found some of those writings on 
20110114010353.000|20110114010356.000|TR0|YouTube.  They were apparently written in 
20110114010356.000|20110114010358.000|TR0|the last four weeks.  And I can tell you 
20110114010358.000|20110114010400.000|TR0|what some of them say.  This is just a 
20110114010400.000|20110114010403.000|TR0|sampling of them.
20110114010403.000|20110114010405.000|TR0|
20110114010405.000|20110114010407.000|TR0|One says, "My favorite activity is 
20110114010407.000|20110114010409.000|TR0|conscience dreaming."  What he meant to 
20110114010409.000|20110114010412.000|TR0|write was conscious dreaming, but he 
20110114010412.000|20110114010414.000|TR0|misspells it and writes conscience 
20110114010414.000|20110114010416.000|TR0|dreaming.  "Some of you don't dream, 
20110114010416.000|20110114010418.000|TR0|sadly."
20110114010418.000|20110114010421.000|TR0|
20110114010421.000|20110114010423.000|TR0|He also wrote, "The population of dreamers 
20110114010423.000|20110114010425.000|TR0|in the United States is less than 5 
20110114010425.000|20110114010428.000|TR0|percent."  And finally, he wrote, "Jared 
20110114010428.000|20110114010430.000|TR0|Loughner is conscience dreaming," again 
20110114010430.000|20110114010432.000|TR0|using the wrong word, "at this moment. 
20110114010432.000|20110114010434.000|TR0|Thus Jared Loughner is asleep."
20110114010434.000|20110114010437.000|TR0|
20110114010437.000|20110114010439.000|TR0|So he was very obsessed with dreaming, 
20110114010439.000|20110114010441.000|TR0|according to his friends. They say he 
20110114010441.000|20110114010443.000|TR0|actually kept a dream journal.  And 
20110114010443.000|20110114010446.000|TR0|friends told us that he felt like he could 
20110114010446.000|20110114010448.000|TR0|be anything and everything that he wanted 
20110114010448.000|20110114010450.000|TR0|in a dream.  Everything that he wasn't in 
20110114010450.000|20110114010453.000|TR0|the real world.  So once again, obsessed 
20110114010453.000|20110114010455.000|TR0|with lucid dreaming or conscious dreaming 
20110114010455.000|20110114010457.000|TR0|-- Eliot?
20110114010457.000|20110114010459.000|TR0|
20110114010459.000|20110114010502.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, Randi, you spoke with 
20110114010502.000|20110114010504.000|TR0|an expert who studied all this stuff.  
20110114010504.000|20110114010506.000|TR0|What this lucid dreaming.  Is it possible 
20110114010506.000|20110114010508.000|TR0|he was dreaming during the shooting?  I 
20110114010508.000|20110114010511.000|TR0|mean is there some completely sort of 
20110114010511.000|20110114010513.000|TR0|psychosis that captured him?
20110114010513.000|20110114010515.000|TR0|
20110114010515.000|20110114010517.000|TR0|KAYE:  Well, that's what we wanted to try 
20110114010517.000|20110114010520.000|TR0|and find out.  So we spoke with the 
20110114010520.000|20110114010522.000|TR0|University of Arizona psychology professor 
20110114010522.000|20110114010524.000|TR0|Gary Schwartz.  And he said that for 
20110114010524.000|20110114010527.000|TR0|someone who's mentally ill which is what 
20110114010527.000|20110114010529.000|TR0|many experts believe Jared Loughner is, 
20110114010529.000|20110114010531.000|TR0|this lucid dreaming can be very dangerous 
20110114010531.000|20110114010533.000|TR0|because they get so deep into it that they 
20110114010533.000|20110114010536.000|TR0|might lose their reality.
20110114010536.000|20110114010538.000|TR0|
20110114010538.000|20110114010540.000|TR0|They might not realize when they are 
20110114010540.000|20110114010542.000|TR0|dreaming and when they're actually in 
20110114010542.000|20110114010545.000|TR0|their own reality.  So I asked him if it's 
20110114010545.000|20110114010547.000|TR0|possible that Jared Loughner was dreaming 
20110114010547.000|20110114010549.000|TR0|when he allegedly shot those 19 people. 
20110114010549.000|20110114010552.000|TR0|And this is what the professor told me.

20110114010558.000|20110114010601.000|TR0|GARY SCHWARTZ, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA:  It 
20110114010601.000|20110114010603.000|TR0|is conceivable from what we know about his 
20110114010603.000|20110114010605.000|TR0|history that he was -- he could have been 
20110114010605.000|20110114010607.000|TR0|confusing when he was in a dream and when 
20110114010607.000|20110114010610.000|TR0|he wasn't in a dream.  And so we have to 
20110114010610.000|20110114010612.000|TR0|be open to that possibility.

20110114010619.000|20110114010621.000|TR0|KAYE:  Now this professor also told me 
20110114010621.000|20110114010623.000|TR0|that he believes that Loughner actually 
20110114010623.000|20110114010626.000|TR0|liked his dream world better, that his 
20110114010626.000|20110114010628.000|TR0|fantasy world, in his dream world that was 
20110114010628.000|20110114010630.000|TR0|really his escape from the darkness that 
20110114010630.000|20110114010632.000|TR0|appeared to be taking over his life -- 
20110114010632.000|20110114010635.000|TR0|Eliot.
20110114010635.000|20110114010637.000|TR0|
20110114010637.000|20110114010639.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.
20110114010639.000|20110114010641.000|TR0|
20110114010641.000|20110114010644.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right, Randi Kaye.  Thanks so 
20110114010644.000|20110114010646.000|TR0|much for your report.
20110114010646.000|20110114010648.000|TR0|
20110114010648.000|20110114010651.000|TR0|Stay tuned for more of Randi's report 
20110114010651.000|20110114010653.000|TR0|tonight at 10:00 p.m. on "ANDERSON COOPER

20110114010657.000|20110114010700.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Now we turn to Jared Loughner's 
20110114010700.000|20110114010702.000|TR0|defense.  How will these rants and other 
20110114010702.000|20110114010704.000|TR0|questionable behaviors factor into it?
20110114010704.000|20110114010706.000|TR0|
20110114010706.000|20110114010709.000|TR0|Joining us to explore all of this, CNN 
20110114010709.000|20110114010711.000|TR0|senior legal analyst Jeff Toobin.
20110114010711.000|20110114010713.000|TR0|
20110114010713.000|20110114010716.000|TR0|Jeff, as always, thank you for being here.
20110114010716.000|20110114010718.000|TR0|
20110114010718.000|20110114010720.000|TR0|PARKER:  Jeffrey, lucid dreaming.  He's 
20110114010720.000|20110114010722.000|TR0|dreaming but he knows he's dreaming.  He 
20110114010722.000|20110114010725.000|TR0|can live in his dreams.  It all sounds 
20110114010725.000|20110114010727.000|TR0|like hocus pocus.  I mean is there 
20110114010727.000|20110114010729.000|TR0|something to this?
20110114010729.000|20110114010731.000|TR0|
20110114010731.000|20110114010734.000|TR0|JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  
20110114010734.000|20110114010736.000|TR0|Well, certainly it seems like the only 
20110114010736.000|20110114010738.000|TR0|hope if this case ever gets to a jury for 
20110114010738.000|20110114010740.000|TR0|the defense is some sort of insanity 
20110114010740.000|20110114010743.000|TR0|defense.  And the legal system has been 
20110114010743.000|20110114010745.000|TR0|struggling for more than 200 years to 
20110114010745.000|20110114010747.000|TR0|define insanity in a way that people can 
20110114010747.000|20110114010750.000|TR0|understand.
20110114010750.000|20110114010752.000|TR0|
20110114010752.000|20110114010754.000|TR0|And the best I can do to describe the 
20110114010754.000|20110114010756.000|TR0|contemporary standard at least in federal 
20110114010756.000|20110114010759.000|TR0|court is that legally insane means you 
20110114010759.000|20110114010801.000|TR0|have to not understand what you're doing.  
20110114010801.000|20110114010803.000|TR0|If you realize you are shooting a human 
20110114010803.000|20110114010805.000|TR0|being, you're not legally sane.  But if 
20110114010805.000|20110114010808.000|TR0|you you're shooting a watermelon, when you 
20110114010808.000|20110114010810.000|TR0|are in fact shooting a human being, then 
20110114010810.000|20110114010812.000|TR0|perhaps you are insane.  It's a very 
20110114010812.000|20110114010815.000|TR0|narrow -- standard.  And it's very hard to 
20110114010815.000|20110114010817.000|TR0|get acquitted on those counts.
20110114010817.000|20110114010819.000|TR0|
20110114010819.000|20110114010821.000|TR0|PARKER:  Yes -- I'm just automatically 
20110114010821.000|20110114010824.000|TR0|skeptical.  If he's writing all these 
20110114010824.000|20110114010826.000|TR0|things about dreaming, is he creating -- 
20110114010826.000|20110114010828.000|TR0|trying to create a case for himself, that 
20110114010828.000|20110114010830.000|TR0|he's insane, in case he gets -- you know?  
20110114010830.000|20110114010833.000|TR0|I mean it sounds like he's planning it all 
20110114010833.000|20110114010835.000|TR0|out.
20110114010835.000|20110114010837.000|TR0|
20110114010837.000|20110114010840.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  It doesn't strike me that way.  
20110114010840.000|20110114010842.000|TR0|The bigger problem for him I think is the 
20110114010842.000|20110114010844.000|TR0|material apparently that was found in his 
20110114010844.000|20110114010846.000|TR0|home that says my assassination.  
20110114010846.000|20110114010849.000|TR0|Giffords' name.  You know I planned this.
20110114010849.000|20110114010851.000|TR0|
20110114010851.000|20110114010853.000|TR0|That certainly suggests that he knew at 
20110114010853.000|20110114010855.000|TR0|least by the legal standard that he knew 
20110114010855.000|20110114010858.000|TR0|what he was doing.  So I think an insanity 
20110114010858.000|20110114010900.000|TR0|defense is going to be very tough for him.
20110114010900.000|20110114010902.000|TR0|
20110114010902.000|20110114010904.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Going to have to say that.  That 
20110114010904.000|20110114010907.000|TR0|one word, assassination.  That has been 
20110114010907.000|20110114010909.000|TR0|recovered, handwritten, I believe, would 
20110114010909.000|20110114010911.000|TR0|seem to doom any capacity that he would 
20110114010911.000|20110114010914.000|TR0|have or an expert on his behalf would have 
20110114010914.000|20110114010916.000|TR0|to say that he did not understand the 
20110114010916.000|20110114010918.000|TR0|wrongfulness of what he was doing.
20110114010918.000|20110114010920.000|TR0|
20110114010920.000|20110114010923.000|TR0|And Jeff, to your point, psychology and 
20110114010923.000|20110114010925.000|TR0|criminal law have never meshed well 
20110114010925.000|20110114010927.000|TR0|because, one, psychology is an effort to 
20110114010927.000|20110114010929.000|TR0|understand and almost explain away.  
20110114010929.000|20110114010932.000|TR0|Criminal law is an effort to say you knew 
20110114010932.000|20110114010934.000|TR0|what you're doing, you're culpable.  
20110114010934.000|20110114010936.000|TR0|There's been a very uncomfortable meshing 
20110114010936.000|20110114010939.000|TR0|of these two as you point out for over 200 
20110114010939.000|20110114010941.000|TR0|years now.
20110114010941.000|20110114010943.000|TR0|
20110114010943.000|20110114010945.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  That's true.  But there is also 
20110114010945.000|20110114010948.000|TR0|some appeal to insanity. Because at some 
20110114010948.000|20110114010950.000|TR0|level with a lot of criminals, and 
20110114010950.000|20110114010952.000|TR0|particularly a criminal like if he did 
20110114010952.000|20110114010954.000|TR0|what we think he did, it seems so crazy.  
20110114010954.000|20110114010957.000|TR0|It seems like not the result of an ordered 
20110114010957.000|20110114010959.000|TR0|mind.  Now we also don't want to let 
20110114010959.000|20110114011001.000|TR0|anyone get away with this.  So we're torn 
20110114011001.000|20110114011003.000|TR0|in both directions.
20110114011003.000|20110114011006.000|TR0|
20110114011006.000|20110114011008.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Here's the thing.  Are -- we 
20110114011008.000|20110114011010.000|TR0|hope sane mind would say anybody who would 
20110114011010.000|20110114011013.000|TR0|do that is necessarily insane.
20110114011013.000|20110114011015.000|TR0|
20110114011015.000|20110114011017.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  Correct.
20110114011017.000|20110114011019.000|TR0|
20110114011019.000|20110114011022.000|TR0|PARKER:  Right.
20110114011022.000|20110114011024.000|TR0|
20110114011024.000|20110114011026.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Because the depravity speaks for 
20110114011026.000|20110114011028.000|TR0|itself.
20110114011028.000|20110114011031.000|TR0|
20110114011031.000|20110114011033.000|TR0|PARKER:  So everybody is crazy.
20110114011033.000|20110114011035.000|TR0|
20110114011035.000|20110114011038.000|TR0|SPITZER:  On the other hand we cannot have 
20110114011038.000|20110114011040.000|TR0|an ordered world in which merely the vast 
20110114011040.000|20110114011042.000|TR0|nature of the criminal act permits one to 
20110114011042.000|20110114011044.000|TR0|get off.  And therefore we see this 
20110114011044.000|20110114011047.000|TR0|depravity, we don't let that become an 
20110114011047.000|20110114011049.000|TR0|excuse nor should we in my mind.
20110114011049.000|20110114011051.000|TR0|
20110114011051.000|20110114011053.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  And the example that defines this 
20110114011053.000|20110114011056.000|TR0|problem for many people is the John 
20110114011056.000|20110114011058.000|TR0|Hinckley case.  Because John Hinckley shot 
20110114011058.000|20110114011100.000|TR0|President Reagan and two other people in 
20110114011100.000|20110114011103.000|TR0|1981.  And he wanted to impress Jodie 
20110114011103.000|20110114011105.000|TR0|Foster and he was obviously a person with 
20110114011105.000|20110114011107.000|TR0|great mental problems.  And he was found 
20110114011107.000|20110114011109.000|TR0|not guilty by reason of insanity.
20110114011109.000|20110114011112.000|TR0|
20110114011112.000|20110114011114.000|TR0|Now that doesn't mean you go home like you 
20110114011114.000|20110114011116.000|TR0|get acquitted in other circumstances.  He 
20110114011116.000|20110114011118.000|TR0|has been in a mental institution for the 
20110114011118.000|20110114011121.000|TR0|past 30 years, although he does get hall 
20110114011121.000|20110114011123.000|TR0|passes to get out.  It is much better to 
20110114011123.000|20110114011125.000|TR0|be found legally insane than to be 
20110114011125.000|20110114011127.000|TR0|convicted.  But a lot of people were very 
20110114011127.000|20110114011130.000|TR0|upset with that verdict.  And the defense 
20110114011130.000|20110114011132.000|TR0|has been tightened since 1981.
20110114011132.000|20110114011134.000|TR0|
20110114011134.000|20110114011137.000|TR0|PARKER:  What about -- what about guilty 
20110114011137.000|20110114011139.000|TR0|and insane?
20110114011139.000|20110114011141.000|TR0|
20110114011141.000|20110114011143.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  You know some states have that 
20110114011143.000|20110114011146.000|TR0|verdict.  Phoenix -- Arizona does not.  
20110114011146.000|20110114011148.000|TR0|The federal government does not.  That's 
20110114011148.000|20110114011150.000|TR0|an attempt to sort of grapple with this.  
20110114011150.000|20110114011152.000|TR0|And I think it's worked in some 
20110114011152.000|20110114011155.000|TR0|circumstances but it doesn't apply here.
20110114011155.000|20110114011157.000|TR0|
20110114011157.000|20110114011159.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Play us -- play out for us, if 
20110114011159.000|20110114011202.000|TR0|you would, where this case is in terms of 
20110114011202.000|20110114011204.000|TR0|the process of the federal prosecution.  
20110114011204.000|20110114011206.000|TR0|What happened the other day?  What will 
20110114011206.000|20110114011208.000|TR0|happen next and when will he actually have 
20110114011208.000|20110114011211.000|TR0|to enter a plea?  And what will happen 
20110114011211.000|20110114011213.000|TR0|thereafter?
20110114011213.000|20110114011215.000|TR0|
20110114011215.000|20110114011217.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  What -- he was arraigned.  That 
20110114011217.000|20110114011220.000|TR0|means he was just had the charges read to 
20110114011220.000|20110114011222.000|TR0|him so he understands.  The judge put the 
20110114011222.000|20110114011224.000|TR0|case down for what's called the 
20110114011224.000|20110114011227.000|TR0|preliminary hearing, 30 days later.  Those 
20110114011227.000|20110114011229.000|TR0|preliminary hearings never happen because 
20110114011229.000|20110114011231.000|TR0|before the 30 days the federal government 
20110114011231.000|20110114011233.000|TR0|presents the case to a grand jury and then 
20110114011233.000|20110114011236.000|TR0|he gets indicted.
20110114011236.000|20110114011238.000|TR0|
20110114011238.000|20110114011240.000|TR0|So he will be indicted sometime in the 
20110114011240.000|20110114011242.000|TR0|next month.  At that point he will be 
20110114011242.000|20110114011245.000|TR0|arraigned by a federal district court.  
20110114011245.000|20110114011247.000|TR0|And then the pretrial motions will start.  
20110114011247.000|20110114011249.000|TR0|Obviously a big part of that will be 
20110114011249.000|20110114011251.000|TR0|psychological evaluation.
20110114011251.000|20110114011254.000|TR0|
20110114011254.000|20110114011256.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And of course there will be two 
20110114011256.000|20110114011258.000|TR0|parallel cases here. There will be a 
20110114011258.000|20110114011301.000|TR0|federal case for the attempted 
20110114011301.000|20110114011303.000|TR0|assassination of the congresswoman and the 
20110114011303.000|20110114011305.000|TR0|-- the killing of the federal judge.  Then 
20110114011305.000|20110114011307.000|TR0|there will be state cases with respect to 
20110114011307.000|20110114011310.000|TR0|the other victims as well.  So how do 
20110114011310.000|20110114011312.000|TR0|those two interplay with each other over 
20110114011312.000|20110114011314.000|TR0|time?
20110114011314.000|20110114011316.000|TR0|
20110114011316.000|20110114011319.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  Well, this is something I think 
20110114011319.000|20110114011321.000|TR0|you know something about, Eliot.  There's 
20110114011321.000|20110114011323.000|TR0|turf battles that go on between 
20110114011323.000|20110114011326.000|TR0|prosecutors with parallel jurisdiction.
20110114011326.000|20110114011328.000|TR0|
20110114011328.000|20110114011330.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110114011330.000|20110114011332.000|TR0|
20110114011332.000|20110114011335.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  And usually they work it out.  
20110114011335.000|20110114011337.000|TR0|But sometimes it can become pretty 
20110114011337.000|20110114011339.000|TR0|contentious.  I think in this circumstance 
20110114011339.000|20110114011341.000|TR0|they'll work it out.  But obviously the 
20110114011341.000|20110114011344.000|TR0|district attorney in Pima County and 
20110114011344.000|20110114011346.000|TR0|United States attorney in Arizona are 
20110114011346.000|20110114011348.000|TR0|going to have to figure out who goes first.
20110114011348.000|20110114011350.000|TR0|
20110114011350.000|20110114011353.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And who will make the 
20110114011353.000|20110114011355.000|TR0|determination about death penalty?
20110114011355.000|20110114011357.000|TR0|
20110114011357.000|20110114011400.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  Well, each jurisdiction has the 
20110114011400.000|20110114011402.000|TR0|option because both the U.S. government 
20110114011402.000|20110114011404.000|TR0|and the state of Arizona have death 
20110114011404.000|20110114011406.000|TR0|penalty.  Clearly this case is e eligible 
20110114011406.000|20110114011409.000|TR0|under both.  So the authorities in both 
20110114011409.000|20110114011411.000|TR0|jurisdictions will have to make that 
20110114011411.000|20110114011413.000|TR0|determination.  That's going to be really 
20110114011413.000|20110114011415.000|TR0|interesting to see who goes first on that 
20110114011415.000|20110114011418.000|TR0|issue.
20110114011418.000|20110114011420.000|TR0|
20110114011420.000|20110114011422.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And will he be tried in Tucson?  
20110114011422.000|20110114011425.000|TR0|Or will the defense move to have it tried 
20110114011425.000|20110114011427.000|TR0|far away saying he can't possibly get an 
20110114011427.000|20110114011429.000|TR0|impartial jury in this community?
20110114011429.000|20110114011431.000|TR0|
20110114011431.000|20110114011434.000|TR0|TOOBIN:  Well, certainly that's going to 
20110114011434.000|20110114011436.000|TR0|be an issue that's on the table.  Remember 
20110114011436.000|20110114011438.000|TR0|the judges in Tucson have already said, we 
20110114011438.000|20110114011440.000|TR0|can't try this case because one of the 
20110114011440.000|20110114011443.000|TR0|victims was our colleague.  So they're 
20110114011443.000|20110114011445.000|TR0|bringing in a federal judge from San Diego.
20110114011445.000|20110114011447.000|TR0|
20110114011447.000|20110114011450.000|TR0|That's just one of the many complexities.  
20110114011450.000|20110114011452.000|TR0|The defense is going to want to do one 
20110114011452.000|20110114011454.000|TR0|thing above all for starters which is slow 
20110114011454.000|20110114011456.000|TR0|this thing down.  Because everybody is so 
20110114011456.000|20110114011459.000|TR0|angry now, the defense is going to want to 
20110114011459.000|20110114011501.000|TR0|put this thing on a slow mo.
20110114011501.000|20110114011503.000|TR0|
20110114011503.000|20110114011505.000|TR0|SPITZER:  There's an old saying that delay 
20110114011505.000|20110114011508.000|TR0|is just as good as an acquittal, just 
20110114011508.000|20110114011510.000|TR0|doesn't last as long.
20110114011510.000|20110114011512.000|TR0|
20110114011512.000|20110114011514.000|TR0|All right.  Thanks so much for joining us,

20110114011634.000|20110114011636.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL 
20110114011636.000|20110114011638.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, thanks.
20110114011638.000|20110114011641.000|TR0|
20110114011641.000|20110114011643.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Sanjay, first, you had a chance 
20110114011643.000|20110114011645.000|TR0|to speak with Captain Mark Kelly, Gabby 
20110114011645.000|20110114011648.000|TR0|Giffords' husband.  First time he spoke 
20110114011648.000|20110114011650.000|TR0|with anybody.  Quite a remarkable 
20110114011650.000|20110114011652.000|TR0|interview.  What did he tell you?
20110114011652.000|20110114011654.000|TR0|
20110114011654.000|20110114011657.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, you know, he was in Houston 
20110114011657.000|20110114011659.000|TR0|when he found out about this, Eliot.  He 
20110114011659.000|20110114011701.000|TR0|got a call from the chief of staff for 
20110114011701.000|20110114011703.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords.  And, you know, he 
20110114011703.000|20110114011706.000|TR0|didn't really know what to believe at that 
20110114011706.000|20110114011708.000|TR0|point.  This hadn't been in the news at 
20110114011708.000|20110114011710.000|TR0|that point.
20110114011710.000|20110114011713.000|TR0|
20110114011713.000|20110114011715.000|TR0|He's a Navy pilot, as you know, was able 
20110114011715.000|20110114011717.000|TR0|to get access to a plane and made his way 
20110114011717.000|20110114011719.000|TR0|to Tucson, about 45 minutes after he took 
20110114011719.000|20110114011722.000|TR0|off.  He arrived here right at the time 
20110114011722.000|20110114011724.000|TR0|that she was being brought out of the 
20110114011724.000|20110114011726.000|TR0|operating room, he told me.
20110114011726.000|20110114011728.000|TR0|
20110114011728.000|20110114011731.000|TR0|And it was at that time that he sat down 
20110114011731.000|20110114011733.000|TR0|and talk to Dr. Rhee and Dr. Lemole, two 
20110114011733.000|20110114011735.000|TR0|doctors that we've gotten to know over 
20110114011735.000|20110114011737.000|TR0|this past week. And they told him that his 
20110114011737.000|20110114011740.000|TR0|wife had been shot in the head at that 
20110114011740.000|20110114011742.000|TR0|point and specifically the nature of the 
20110114011742.000|20110114011744.000|TR0|injury and sort of their expectations over 
20110114011744.000|20110114011747.000|TR0|the next several days.
20110114011747.000|20110114011749.000|TR0|
20110114011749.000|20110114011751.000|TR0|You know he talked a lot about last night. 
20110114011751.000|20110114011753.000|TR0| It was a -- you know, it was a really 
20110114011753.000|20110114011756.000|TR0|important night.  I think -- you've heard 
20110114011756.000|20110114011758.000|TR0|what happened.  The president visiting 
20110114011758.000|20110114011800.000|TR0|with her, her opening her eyes.  He 
20110114011800.000|20110114011802.000|TR0|doesn't strike me as the kind of guy who's 
20110114011802.000|20110114011805.000|TR0|prone to using the word miracle just off 
20110114011805.000|20110114011807.000|TR0|the cuff.
20110114011807.000|20110114011809.000|TR0|
20110114011809.000|20110114011812.000|TR0|But he said it was a miraculous moment.  I 
20110114011812.000|20110114011814.000|TR0|asked him, I said did your wife, the 
20110114011814.000|20110114011816.000|TR0|congresswoman recognize that the president 
20110114011816.000|20110114011818.000|TR0|of the United States was in her room.  And 
20110114011818.000|20110114011821.000|TR0|he sort of paused for a second and said, I 
20110114011821.000|20110114011823.000|TR0|think she knew that the president was 
20110114011823.000|20110114011825.000|TR0|there but she was still sort of struggling 
20110114011825.000|20110114011827.000|TR0|to figure out why.
20110114011827.000|20110114011830.000|TR0|
20110114011830.000|20110114011832.000|TR0|And that gives you a good sense of sort of 
20110114011832.000|20110114011834.000|TR0|where her mind is at this point.  She's 
20110114011834.000|20110114011837.000|TR0|moving her left arm spontaneously.  She 
20110114011837.000|20110114011839.000|TR0|still has her breathing tube in although 
20110114011839.000|20110114011841.000|TR0|he believes it could be taken out as early 
20110114011841.000|20110114011843.000|TR0|as tomorrow.
20110114011843.000|20110114011846.000|TR0|
20110114011846.000|20110114011848.000|TR0|So he shared a lot of details about sort 
20110114011848.000|20110114011850.000|TR0|of over the last few days, what's been 
20110114011850.000|20110114011852.000|TR0|happening with him and how he's been 
20110114011852.000|20110114011855.000|TR0|making his decisions.
20110114011855.000|20110114011857.000|TR0|
20110114011857.000|20110114011859.000|TR0|PARKER:  That's a remarkable --
20110114011859.000|20110114011901.000|TR0|
20110114011901.000|20110114011904.000|TR0|GUPTA:  I want to tell you one more thing 
20110114011904.000|20110114011906.000|TR0|as well, if I -- if I could just one more 
20110114011906.000|20110114011908.000|TR0|thing as well.
20110114011908.000|20110114011911.000|TR0|
20110114011911.000|20110114011913.000|TR0|PARKER:  Sure.
20110114011913.000|20110114011915.000|TR0|
20110114011915.000|20110114011917.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You know this whole idea of where 
20110114011917.000|20110114011920.000|TR0|she is in her own mind. Doctor Lemole is 
20110114011920.000|20110114011922.000|TR0|the chief neurosurgeon.  I asked him 
20110114011922.000|20110114011924.000|TR0|specifically about that as well.  Just 
20110114011924.000|20110114011926.000|TR0|take a quick listen to this.
20110114011926.000|20110114011929.000|TR0|

20110114011931.000|20110114011933.000|TR0|
20110114011933.000|20110114011936.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Do you feel that she understands 
20110114011936.000|20110114011938.000|TR0|all that has happened to her?
20110114011938.000|20110114011940.000|TR0|
20110114011940.000|20110114011942.000|TR0|DR. MICHAEL LEMOLE, CHIEF OF NEUROSURGERY: 
20110114011942.000|20110114011945.000|TR0| I'm starting to think so.
20110114011945.000|20110114011947.000|TR0|
20110114011947.000|20110114011949.000|TR0|GUPTA:  She knows.
20110114011949.000|20110114011951.000|TR0|
20110114011951.000|20110114011954.000|TR0|LEMOLE:  It's really -- I was there when 
20110114011954.000|20110114011956.000|TR0|the congresswoman and the senator were in 
20110114011956.000|20110114011958.000|TR0|the room.  And to see her open her eye and 
20110114011958.000|20110114012000.000|TR0|look at them, there's just no question in 
20110114012000.000|20110114012003.000|TR0|my mind.  And she's done that for her 
20110114012003.000|20110114012005.000|TR0|husband as well.  Those glimmers of 
20110114012005.000|20110114012007.000|TR0|recognition, that tracking of the eyes 
20110114012007.000|20110114012010.000|TR0|tells you a whole lot more, that she is 
20110114012010.000|20110114012012.000|TR0|aware of her surroundings to some extent, 
20110114012012.000|20110114012014.000|TR0|coming in and out perhaps, and that she is 
20110114012014.000|20110114012016.000|TR0|trying to engage that reality as well.
20110114012016.000|20110114012019.000|TR0|
20110114012019.000|20110114012021.000|TR0|(END OF VIDEO CLIP)
20110114012021.000|20110114012023.000|TR0|
20110114012023.000|20110114012025.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Kathleen, I wanted you to listen 
20110114012025.000|20110114012028.000|TR0|to that because, you know, we've made a 
20110114012028.000|20110114012030.000|TR0|lot of the fact that she's been following 
20110114012030.000|20110114012032.000|TR0|commands. But what he's describing there, 
20110114012032.000|20110114012035.000|TR0|Dr. Lemole, and also her husband, is even 
20110114012035.000|20110114012037.000|TR0|a higher level of cognitive function and, 
20110114012037.000|20110114012039.000|TR0|you know, it's a step forward which is 
20110114012039.000|20110114012041.000|TR0|exactly what they're looking for.
20110114012041.000|20110114012044.000|TR0|
20110114012044.000|20110114012046.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, given that, Sanjay, and 
20110114012046.000|20110114012048.000|TR0|given the extreme injury she suffered to 
20110114012048.000|20110114012050.000|TR0|her brain, what do you -- what is her 
20110114012050.000|20110114012053.000|TR0|prognosis?  I mean she seems to be 
20110114012053.000|20110114012055.000|TR0|experiencing a series of amazing steps 
20110114012055.000|20110114012057.000|TR0|forward.
20110114012057.000|20110114012100.000|TR0|
20110114012100.000|20110114012102.000|TR0|GUPTA:  She is able to, you know, move 
20110114012102.000|20110114012104.000|TR0|both of her legs.  She was dangling her 
20110114012104.000|20110114012106.000|TR0|legs over the side of the bed as you 
20110114012106.000|20110114012109.000|TR0|mentioned.
20110114012109.000|20110114012111.000|TR0|
20110114012111.000|20110114012113.000|TR0|You know the biggest concern at this point 
20110114012113.000|20110114012115.000|TR0|is still the strength in the right arm and 
20110114012115.000|20110114012118.000|TR0|the right leg to some extent.  Perhaps 
20110114012118.000|20110114012120.000|TR0|even more so the right arm.  And also her 
20110114012120.000|20110114012122.000|TR0|language function overall.  Her ability to 
20110114012122.000|20110114012124.000|TR0|receive communication, her ability to 
20110114012124.000|20110114012127.000|TR0|express herself.
20110114012127.000|20110114012129.000|TR0|
20110114012129.000|20110114012131.000|TR0|We can't -- we can't test that because she 
20110114012131.000|20110114012134.000|TR0|still has a breathing tube in.  And 
20110114012134.000|20110114012136.000|TR0|they're still -- they're not talking a lot 
20110114012136.000|20110114012138.000|TR0|about the function of her right arm, 
20110114012138.000|20110114012140.000|TR0|although I think it's safe to say that 
20110114012140.000|20110114012143.000|TR0|that's one of the areas of the brain that 
20110114012143.000|20110114012145.000|TR0|they're probably most worried about.
20110114012145.000|20110114012147.000|TR0|
20110114012147.000|20110114012149.000|TR0|So it's hard to say, Kathleen.  And, you 
20110114012149.000|20110114012152.000|TR0|know, people can have improvements months 
20110114012152.000|20110114012154.000|TR0|afterwards.  So where this ends up, I 
20110114012154.000|20110114012156.000|TR0|think is -- it really just speculation at 
20110114012156.000|20110114012159.000|TR0|this point.
20110114012159.000|20110114012201.000|TR0|
20110114012201.000|20110114012203.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Yes, you know, Sanjay, this may 
20110114012203.000|20110114012205.000|TR0|be unfair, as you say, speculation is 
20110114012205.000|20110114012208.000|TR0|probably useless.  But as somebody who 
20110114012208.000|20110114012210.000|TR0|really has watched this, as so many of us 
20110114012210.000|20110114012212.000|TR0|have with amazement at the speed of the 
20110114012212.000|20110114012214.000|TR0|recovery, is there any hope for complete 
20110114012214.000|20110114012217.000|TR0|cognitive recovery so that we will once 
20110114012217.000|20110114012219.000|TR0|again see her on the floor of the House of 
20110114012219.000|20110114012221.000|TR0|Representatives giving an impassioned 
20110114012221.000|20110114012224.000|TR0|speech?  Is that what we can hope and pray 
20110114012224.000|20110114012226.000|TR0|for?
20110114012226.000|20110114012228.000|TR0|
20110114012228.000|20110114012230.000|TR0|GUPTA:  I think the idea of a full 
20110114012230.000|20110114012233.000|TR0|cognitive recovery is there, Eliot.  You 
20110114012233.000|20110114012235.000|TR0|know, I was referring specifically to her 
20110114012235.000|20110114012237.000|TR0|motor function. But I think so.  Given the 
20110114012237.000|20110114012239.000|TR0|fact that she was following commands even 
20110114012239.000|20110114012242.000|TR0|before she had surgery is very suggestive 
20110114012242.000|20110114012244.000|TR0|of the fact that she -- her brain injury, 
20110114012244.000|20110114012246.000|TR0|even though it was significant, she was 
20110114012246.000|20110114012248.000|TR0|already compensating even at that time.
20110114012248.000|20110114012251.000|TR0|
20110114012251.000|20110114012253.000|TR0|And also, the one thing you can say, 
20110114012253.000|20110114012255.000|TR0|there's a lot of speculation in 
20110114012255.000|20110114012258.000|TR0|neurosurgery, but the one thing that you 
20110114012258.000|20110114012300.000|TR0|can say is that the rate of recovery 
20110114012300.000|20110114012302.000|TR0|immediately after an injury is directly 
20110114012302.000|20110114012304.000|TR0|proportional to how good, how good the 
20110114012304.000|20110114012307.000|TR0|outcome is going to be overall.  She's 
20110114012307.000|20110114012309.000|TR0|been recovering fast.
20110114012309.000|20110114012311.000|TR0|
20110114012311.000|20110114012313.000|TR0|PARKER:  And what about other patients, 
20110114012313.000|20110114012316.000|TR0|Sanjay?  How are they doing?
20110114012316.000|20110114012318.000|TR0|
20110114012318.000|20110114012320.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, you know there are so many 
20110114012320.000|20110114012323.000|TR0|patients still in the hospital here.  I 
20110114012323.000|20110114012325.000|TR0|have heard some incredible stories from 
20110114012325.000|20110114012327.000|TR0|some of the patients today.  Some of them 
20110114012327.000|20110114012329.000|TR0|are a little bit tough to even talk about. 
20110114012329.000|20110114012332.000|TR0| But one of them, I'll tell you real 
20110114012332.000|20110114012334.000|TR0|quickly, Ron Barber, is one of the 
20110114012334.000|20110114012336.000|TR0|staffers for the congresswoman as well.  
20110114012336.000|20110114012338.000|TR0|Head of community outreach.
20110114012338.000|20110114012341.000|TR0|
20110114012341.000|20110114012343.000|TR0|He was standing right next to her when 
20110114012343.000|20110114012345.000|TR0|this happened.  And he relayed the story 
20110114012345.000|20110114012347.000|TR0|to me today.  He heard the shot.  And he 
20110114012347.000|20110114012350.000|TR0|was actually looking at the congresswoman 
20110114012350.000|20110114012352.000|TR0|when she got shot.  He turned his head to 
20110114012352.000|20110114012354.000|TR0|look to see where it came from.  And he 
20110114012354.000|20110114012357.000|TR0|himself was shot in the face and in the 
20110114012357.000|20110114012359.000|TR0|leg.
20110114012359.000|20110114012401.000|TR0|
20110114012401.000|20110114012403.000|TR0|The congresswoman landed.  He landed 
20110114012403.000|20110114012406.000|TR0|behind the congresswoman. So he was lying 
20110114012406.000|20110114012408.000|TR0|down looking at her back.  Both of them 
20110114012408.000|20110114012410.000|TR0|slumped over. He was still conscious.  And 
20110114012410.000|20110114012412.000|TR0|then right in between them, Gabe Zimmerman 
20110114012412.000|20110114012415.000|TR0|fell.  He had been shot and Ron told me 
20110114012415.000|20110114012417.000|TR0|and it was tough for him to talk about 
20110114012417.000|20110114012419.000|TR0|this.  But he told me that he knew that 
20110114012419.000|20110114012422.000|TR0|Gabe was dead right at that time.
20110114012422.000|20110114012424.000|TR0|
20110114012424.000|20110114012426.000|TR0|It was just a horrific scene.  But he also 
20110114012426.000|20110114012428.000|TR0|described a woman named Anna who wasn't 
20110114012428.000|20110114012431.000|TR0|even at the even who came over and held 
20110114012431.000|20110114012433.000|TR0|pressure that was significant bleeding on 
20110114012433.000|20110114012435.000|TR0|his leg.  And he told me, his doctors can 
20110114012435.000|20110114012437.000|TR0|confirm this that had she not come over 
20110114012437.000|20110114012440.000|TR0|and held that pressure, he probably 
20110114012440.000|20110114012442.000|TR0|wouldn't have survived.  So real heroes 
20110114012442.000|20110114012444.000|TR0|among the horror there.
20110114012444.000|20110114012447.000|TR0|
20110114012447.000|20110114012449.000|TR0|PARKER:  Wow.

20110114012451.000|20110114012453.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, Sanjay, tales of 
20110114012453.000|20110114012456.000|TR0|heroism just keep coming out.  A 
20110114012456.000|20110114012458.000|TR0|remarkable thing.  And even the scene 
20110114012458.000|20110114012500.000|TR0|behind you, the tributes that are being 
20110114012500.000|20110114012502.000|TR0|paid by the public.  There's outpouring of 
20110114012502.000|20110114012505.000|TR0|support and hope.  Just wonderful to see 
20110114012505.000|20110114012507.000|TR0|in the aftermath of this tragedy.

20110114012516.000|20110114012518.000|TR0|Next, there was another gun at the 
20110114012518.000|20110114012521.000|TR0|shooting scene last Saturday. We tell you 
20110114012521.000|20110114012523.000|TR0|what could have happened when we return.  
20110114012523.000|20110114012525.000|TR0|Stay with us.

20110114012555.000|20110114012557.000|TR0|PARKER:  You may have heard of Joe 
20110114012557.000|20110114012559.000|TR0|Zamudio.  Joe is one of the heroes of the 
20110114012559.000|20110114012601.000|TR0|shooting incident in Tucson on Saturday 
20110114012601.000|20110114012604.000|TR0|morning.  He helped restrain the shooter 
20110114012604.000|20110114012606.000|TR0|Jared Loughner before first responders 
20110114012606.000|20110114012608.000|TR0|arrived on the scene.
20110114012608.000|20110114012611.000|TR0|
20110114012611.000|20110114012613.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Joe is here tonight and we'll 
20110114012613.000|20110114012615.000|TR0|hear his remarkable story.  But there's a 
20110114012615.000|20110114012617.000|TR0|twist to a story we want to explore.  When 
20110114012617.000|20110114012620.000|TR0|Joe arrived on the scene he was armed, he 
20110114012620.000|20110114012622.000|TR0|had his gun ready with the safety off.  In 
20110114012622.000|20110114012624.000|TR0|that moment of chaos, Joe made a split 
20110114012624.000|20110114012626.000|TR0|second decision not to fire his gun.
20110114012626.000|20110114012629.000|TR0|
20110114012629.000|20110114012631.000|TR0|But what might have happened if he had?
20110114012631.000|20110114012633.000|TR0|
20110114012633.000|20110114012635.000|TR0|Please welcome, Joe Zamudio.
20110114012635.000|20110114012638.000|TR0|
20110114012638.000|20110114012640.000|TR0|Joe, thank you for being here and thank 
20110114012640.000|20110114012642.000|TR0|you for everything you did on Saturday.
20110114012642.000|20110114012645.000|TR0|
20110114012645.000|20110114012647.000|TR0|JOE ZAMUDIO, TUCSON SHOOTING EYEWITNESS:  
20110114012647.000|20110114012649.000|TR0|Thank you.       PARKER:  All right, Joe --
20110114012649.000|20110114012651.000|TR0|
20110114012651.000|20110114012654.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know --
20110114012654.000|20110114012656.000|TR0|
20110114012656.000|20110114012658.000|TR0|PARKER:  Before -- just tell us what 
20110114012658.000|20110114012700.000|TR0|happened Saturday morning. Tell us what 
20110114012700.000|20110114012703.000|TR0|you saw.
20110114012703.000|20110114012705.000|TR0|
20110114012705.000|20110114012707.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  Well, Kathleen, I went into the 
20110114012707.000|20110114012710.000|TR0|Walgreens to buy something.  And before I 
20110114012710.000|20110114012712.000|TR0|could even finish my transaction I heard 
20110114012712.000|20110114012714.000|TR0|the gunshots ring out.  And I just 
20110114012714.000|20110114012716.000|TR0|reacted.  I didn't think about it at all.  
20110114012716.000|20110114012719.000|TR0|You know I've heard that question more 
20110114012719.000|20110114012721.000|TR0|times than I can count. And I honestly I 
20110114012721.000|20110114012723.000|TR0|didn't think.  If I had I probably would 
20110114012723.000|20110114012725.000|TR0|have hit the ground.
20110114012725.000|20110114012728.000|TR0|
20110114012728.000|20110114012730.000|TR0|PARKER:  But when you got there, you saw a 
20110114012730.000|20110114012732.000|TR0|man holding a gun. Tell us what happened 
20110114012732.000|20110114012734.000|TR0|then.
20110114012734.000|20110114012737.000|TR0|
20110114012737.000|20110114012739.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  Well, as I came through the door 
20110114012739.000|20110114012741.000|TR0|of the store I saw a man who I believe was 
20110114012741.000|20110114012744.000|TR0|wounded saying shooter, shooter, get down. 
20110114012744.000|20110114012746.000|TR0| At that instant it affirmed my assumption 
20110114012746.000|20110114012748.000|TR0|that the -- there were gunshots that I had 
20110114012748.000|20110114012750.000|TR0|heard.  And in that second, split second, 
20110114012750.000|20110114012753.000|TR0|I took the safety off my gun and I palmed 
20110114012753.000|20110114012755.000|TR0|it and I was ready to go.  But I didn't 
20110114012755.000|20110114012757.000|TR0|remove it from my coat yet.
20110114012757.000|20110114012759.000|TR0|
20110114012759.000|20110114012802.000|TR0|I turned my shoulders and squared them to 
20110114012802.000|20110114012804.000|TR0|the breezeway.  And in that second I saw 
20110114012804.000|20110114012806.000|TR0|the gentleman who was not the shooter, I 
20110114012806.000|20110114012809.000|TR0|later found out, holding a firearm.  And I 
20110114012809.000|20110114012811.000|TR0|saw that firearm had been cleared.  And 
20110114012811.000|20110114012813.000|TR0|the slide was locked black.  And I decided 
20110114012813.000|20110114012815.000|TR0|that he wasn't a threat to me.  And I 
20110114012815.000|20110114012818.000|TR0|could possibly take him down without 
20110114012818.000|20110114012820.000|TR0|shooting him, which was pretty important 
20110114012820.000|20110114012822.000|TR0|to me to not to be an executioner.
20110114012822.000|20110114012824.000|TR0|
20110114012824.000|20110114012827.000|TR0|And luckily, you know, and I made that 
20110114012827.000|20110114012829.000|TR0|choice.  And I ran up on him.  And I 
20110114012829.000|20110114012831.000|TR0|grabbed his wrist and told him to drop it. 
20110114012831.000|20110114012834.000|TR0| At which point, everyone around me made 
20110114012834.000|20110114012836.000|TR0|it pretty clear that the shooter was a 
20110114012836.000|20110114012838.000|TR0|different man.  The one they were holding 
20110114012838.000|20110114012840.000|TR0|to the ground and struggling.  And that 
20110114012840.000|20110114012843.000|TR0|was just another bystander like myself 
20110114012843.000|20110114012845.000|TR0|trying to help.
20110114012845.000|20110114012847.000|TR0|
20110114012847.000|20110114012849.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Now what you did, Joe -- I got 
20110114012849.000|20110114012852.000|TR0|to tell you what you did, it was an act of 
20110114012852.000|20110114012854.000|TR0|heroism.  It's kind of remarkable.  The 
20110114012854.000|20110114012856.000|TR0|question I've got for you.  I mean it was 
20110114012856.000|20110114012858.000|TR0|an incredibly close call.  You made the 
20110114012858.000|20110114012901.000|TR0|right judgment, a remarkably good judgment 
20110114012901.000|20110114012903.000|TR0|not to shoot the other fellow who was 
20110114012903.000|20110114012905.000|TR0|there assisting as you were.
20110114012905.000|20110114012908.000|TR0|
20110114012908.000|20110114012910.000|TR0|Does it worry you, my goodness how close 
20110114012910.000|20110114012912.000|TR0|you came in having that many guns around 
20110114012912.000|20110114012914.000|TR0|might have actually caused a tragedy?

20110114012917.000|20110114012919.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  No.  I mean, I made a really 
20110114012919.000|20110114012921.000|TR0|good decision.  That's why I carry a gun 
20110114012921.000|20110114012923.000|TR0|because I trust myself to make the right 
20110114012923.000|20110114012926.000|TR0|decision.  You know?  I didn't pull it 
20110114012926.000|20110114012928.000|TR0|out.  Nobody even knew.  I told the police 
20110114012928.000|20110114012930.000|TR0|officer, the first one I spoke to.  I 
20110114012930.000|20110114012933.000|TR0|said, sir, I am carrying a firearm.  I 
20110114012933.000|20110114012935.000|TR0|didn't pull it out.  I didn't use it.  It 
20110114012935.000|20110114012937.000|TR0|wasn't necessary.  But I thought you 
20110114012937.000|20110114012939.000|TR0|should know.  And he said thank you. You 
20110114012939.000|20110114012942.000|TR0|know?
20110114012942.000|20110114012944.000|TR0|
20110114012944.000|20110114012946.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right.       ZAMUDIO:  We 
20110114012946.000|20110114012948.000|TR0|will talk to you about it later.  I'm not 
20110114012948.000|20110114012951.000|TR0|worried. Go ahead.
20110114012951.000|20110114012953.000|TR0|
20110114012953.000|20110114012955.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Does it worry you at all?  I 
20110114012955.000|20110114012957.000|TR0|mean, look, we don't want to do anything 
20110114012957.000|20110114013000.000|TR0|to diminish the heroism and the wisdom of 
20110114013000.000|20110114013002.000|TR0|your decision.  But with too many people 
20110114013002.000|20110114013004.000|TR0|carrying guns, doesn't it increase the 
20110114013004.000|20110114013007.000|TR0|odds somebody might make the wrong 
20110114013007.000|20110114013009.000|TR0|decision and shoot an innocent person even 
20110114013009.000|20110114013011.000|TR0|with all the good intent to actually shoot 
20110114013011.000|20110114013013.000|TR0|only somebody who was actually committing 
20110114013013.000|20110114013016.000|TR0|the crime?
20110114013016.000|20110114013018.000|TR0|
20110114013018.000|20110114013020.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  Yes, I mean, you can't know what 
20110114013020.000|20110114013022.000|TR0|people are going to do.  And I'm not 
20110114013022.000|20110114013025.000|TR0|trying to say that I'm perfect or that 
20110114013025.000|20110114013027.000|TR0|everyone out there will be in that moment 
20110114013027.000|20110114013029.000|TR0|as thoughtful as I was.
20110114013029.000|20110114013032.000|TR0|
20110114013032.000|20110114013034.000|TR0|I definitely don't believe that everyone 
20110114013034.000|20110114013036.000|TR0|should carry a gun. There is a lot of 
20110114013036.000|20110114013038.000|TR0|people who don't have the right responses 
20110114013038.000|20110114013041.000|TR0|and who aren't comfortable and practice 
20110114013041.000|20110114013043.000|TR0|and who would make the wrong decision. And 
20110114013043.000|20110114013045.000|TR0|there's people who are just afraid and who 
20110114013045.000|20110114013047.000|TR0|would -- who would not at all be a good 
20110114013047.000|20110114013050.000|TR0|person to carry a gun.
20110114013050.000|20110114013052.000|TR0|
20110114013052.000|20110114013054.000|TR0|But I feel like if you -- if you want to 
20110114013054.000|20110114013057.000|TR0|protect yourself, and if you're confident, 
20110114013057.000|20110114013059.000|TR0|then you should be allowed to.  And I'm an 
20110114013059.000|20110114013101.000|TR0|American.
20110114013101.000|20110114013103.000|TR0|
20110114013103.000|20110114013106.000|TR0|SPITZER:  There's been a lot of 
20110114013106.000|20110114013108.000|TR0|conversation the past couple of days, 
20110114013108.000|20110114013110.000|TR0|obviously, about does it make sense to 
20110114013110.000|20110114013112.000|TR0|limit access to guns.  I just want to ask 
20110114013112.000|20110114013115.000|TR0|you, one of the ideas out there is to at 
20110114013115.000|20110114013117.000|TR0|least to not permit somebody to buy a 
20110114013117.000|20110114013119.000|TR0|magazine with 33 bullets in it for a Glock 
20110114013119.000|20110114013121.000|TR0|9. I mean does that sort of limit make 
20110114013121.000|20110114013124.000|TR0|sense to you?
20110114013124.000|20110114013126.000|TR0|
20110114013126.000|20110114013128.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  You know, I mean I guess 33 is a 
20110114013128.000|20110114013131.000|TR0|little bit excessive. I own -- personally 
20110114013131.000|20110114013133.000|TR0|I own extended magazines.  It's a little 
20110114013133.000|20110114013135.000|TR0|bit easier when you're at the range.  You 
20110114013135.000|20110114013137.000|TR0|don't have to reload as much. It's -- I 
20110114013137.000|20110114013140.000|TR0|mean it's purely a convenience thing.  
20110114013140.000|20110114013142.000|TR0|It's not about -- the whole thing is, you 
20110114013142.000|20110114013144.000|TR0|know, if you needed 30 rounds and you 
20110114013144.000|20110114013146.000|TR0|couldn't get a 30-round clip, he could 
20110114013146.000|20110114013149.000|TR0|have had two guns with 15-round clips.
20110114013149.000|20110114013151.000|TR0|
20110114013151.000|20110114013153.000|TR0|I mean you're splitting hairs at that 
20110114013153.000|20110114013156.000|TR0|point.  The problem is not the amount of 
20110114013156.000|20110114013158.000|TR0|bullets or whether or not he could get a 
20110114013158.000|20110114013200.000|TR0|gun, the problem is that this person got 
20110114013200.000|20110114013202.000|TR0|to this point emotionally and mentally 
20110114013202.000|20110114013205.000|TR0|where they could do something like this.
20110114013205.000|20110114013207.000|TR0|
20110114013207.000|20110114013209.000|TR0|And I feel like we as a community and as a 
20110114013209.000|20110114013211.000|TR0|country have the responsibility to protect 
20110114013211.000|20110114013214.000|TR0|people among who need help like this.  To, 
20110114013214.000|20110114013216.000|TR0|you know, point them out and to get them 
20110114013216.000|20110114013218.000|TR0|help.  Even if that means committing 
20110114013218.000|20110114013221.000|TR0|people or whatever needs to happen, we 
20110114013221.000|20110114013223.000|TR0|can't allow things like this to go down.  
20110114013223.000|20110114013225.000|TR0|And it's not a -- I mean you can control 
20110114013225.000|20110114013227.000|TR0|guns better.  You could try.  But the 
20110114013227.000|20110114013230.000|TR0|truth is that criminals can get guns. They 
20110114013230.000|20110114013232.000|TR0|can still them, they can borrow them, they 
20110114013232.000|20110114013234.000|TR0|can do anything.  I mean, you can buy one 
20110114013234.000|20110114013236.000|TR0|out of a trunk.  It's not that hard to get 
20110114013236.000|20110114013239.000|TR0|a gun.  The real thing is can we stop 
20110114013239.000|20110114013241.000|TR0|people from being irresponsible?
20110114013241.000|20110114013243.000|TR0|
20110114013243.000|20110114013245.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right.  Joe Zamudio, thank 
20110114013245.000|20110114013248.000|TR0|you so much.  We appreciate your quick, 
20110114013248.000|20110114013250.000|TR0|clear thinking in those circumstances and 
20110114013250.000|20110114013252.000|TR0|we appreciate you coming on the show.

20110114013301.000|20110114013304.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  Have a wonderful evening.

20110114013310.000|20110114013313.000|TR0|On Tuesday, we spoke with Alan Corwin, an 
20110114013313.000|20110114013315.000|TR0|expert on gun law and author of "The 
20110114013315.000|20110114013317.000|TR0|Arizona Gun Owner's Guide." Mr. Korwin 
20110114013317.000|20110114013320.000|TR0|feels strongly that when more people carry 
20110114013320.000|20110114013322.000|TR0|guns we're all safer.  Mr. Korwin is back 
20110114013322.000|20110114013324.000|TR0|with us tonight.
20110114013324.000|20110114013326.000|TR0|
20110114013326.000|20110114013329.000|TR0|Welcome, Alan.  Thanks for coming back on 
20110114013329.000|20110114013331.000|TR0|the show.

20110114013335.000|20110114013338.000|TR0|OWNER'S GUIDE:  It's a pleasure to be 
20110114013338.000|20110114013340.000|TR0|here, Eliot.
20110114013340.000|20110114013342.000|TR0|
20110114013342.000|20110114013344.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Thank you.
20110114013344.000|20110114013347.000|TR0|
20110114013347.000|20110114013349.000|TR0|PARKER:  Hi, Mr. Korwin, I'm here too.  
20110114013349.000|20110114013351.000|TR0|Nice to talk to you.
20110114013351.000|20110114013354.000|TR0|
20110114013354.000|20110114013356.000|TR0|KORWIN:  Hi, Kathleen.  Sorry.
20110114013356.000|20110114013358.000|TR0|
20110114013358.000|20110114013400.000|TR0|PARKER:  That's OK.  Hey, I'd like to 
20110114013400.000|20110114013403.000|TR0|listen to something that you said to us on 
20110114013403.000|20110114013405.000|TR0|Tuesday.
20110114013405.000|20110114013407.000|TR0|

20110114013409.000|20110114013412.000|TR0|
20110114013412.000|20110114013414.000|TR0|KORWIN:  The only way to have stopped 
20110114013414.000|20110114013416.000|TR0|Loughner was with countervailing force.  
20110114013416.000|20110114013419.000|TR0|No, you don't want a shootout in public.  
20110114013419.000|20110114013421.000|TR0|But if somebody goes berserk, look how the 
20110114013421.000|20110114013423.000|TR0|story would have been different if some 
20110114013423.000|20110114013425.000|TR0|individual there had a firearm, one of Ms. 
20110114013425.000|20110114013428.000|TR0|Giffords' aides had a firearm and was able 
20110114013428.000|20110114013430.000|TR0|to return fire.  That's the real travesty. 
20110114013430.000|20110114013432.000|TR0|There was nobody there capable of 
20110114013432.000|20110114013434.000|TR0|returning fire.
20110114013434.000|20110114013437.000|TR0|

20110114013439.000|20110114013441.000|TR0|
20110114013441.000|20110114013444.000|TR0|PARKER:  OK.  Well, we now know from Joe 
20110114013444.000|20110114013446.000|TR0|Zamudio that, in fact, he was capable of 
20110114013446.000|20110114013448.000|TR0|returning fire.  So here's a 24-year-old 
20110114013448.000|20110114013450.000|TR0|with a gun. He took off the safety.  He 
20110114013450.000|20110114013453.000|TR0|came into this chaotic, traumatic scene, 
20110114013453.000|20110114013455.000|TR0|and he was prepared to shoot the wrong 
20110114013455.000|20110114013457.000|TR0|man.  In this case, you know, he didn't, 
20110114013457.000|20110114013459.000|TR0|thank God.  But do you still feel that 
20110114013459.000|20110114013502.000|TR0|countervailing is the best remedy?
20110114013502.000|20110114013504.000|TR0|
20110114013504.000|20110114013506.000|TR0|KORWIN:  You know, I thought about that a 
20110114013506.000|20110114013508.000|TR0|lot since last time, Kathleen.  You were 
20110114013508.000|20110114013511.000|TR0|concerned, legitimately that somebody 
20110114013511.000|20110114013513.000|TR0|might shoot and create more trouble.  But 
20110114013513.000|20110114013515.000|TR0|if there was another active shooter there, 
20110114013515.000|20110114013518.000|TR0|or if Joe was there earlier, he might have 
20110114013518.000|20110114013520.000|TR0|stopped him.  And the chances of him 
20110114013520.000|20110114013522.000|TR0|shooting 19 people by accident is 
20110114013522.000|20110114013524.000|TR0|extraordinarily remote.  The chances are 
20110114013524.000|20110114013527.000|TR0|if he had been there earlier he could have 
20110114013527.000|20110114013529.000|TR0|stopped him and he did use countervailing 
20110114013529.000|20110114013531.000|TR0|force.  He wrestled him to the ground.  
20110114013531.000|20110114013533.000|TR0|And they held him down.
20110114013533.000|20110114013536.000|TR0|
20110114013536.000|20110114013538.000|TR0|Force was required to stop this guy.  
20110114013538.000|20110114013540.000|TR0|Whatever sort.  If you can avoid shooting, 
20110114013540.000|20110114013543.000|TR0|you always do.  But if innocent life 
20110114013543.000|20110114013545.000|TR0|immediately depends on it, you must to 
20110114013545.000|20110114013547.000|TR0|save the lives and to save yourselves.
20110114013547.000|20110114013549.000|TR0|
20110114013549.000|20110114013552.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, that's an important point 
20110114013552.000|20110114013554.000|TR0|because responsible gun owners do know 
20110114013554.000|20110114013556.000|TR0|that.  You don't shoot unless you 
20110114013556.000|20110114013558.000|TR0|absolutely have to.
20110114013558.000|20110114013601.000|TR0|
20110114013601.000|20110114013603.000|TR0|KORWIN:  Correct.
20110114013603.000|20110114013605.000|TR0|
20110114013605.000|20110114013608.000|TR0|PARKER:  So I think that's a point worth 
20110114013608.000|20110114013610.000|TR0|repeating.
20110114013610.000|20110114013612.000|TR0|
20110114013612.000|20110114013614.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, but, Alan, obviously 
20110114013614.000|20110114013617.000|TR0|you and I come from slightly different 
20110114013617.000|20110114013619.000|TR0|perspectives on this issue.  I want to 
20110114013619.000|20110114013621.000|TR0|give you some numbers that come from the 
20110114013621.000|20110114013623.000|TR0|Brady campaign to prevent gun violence, 
20110114013623.000|20110114013626.000|TR0|and I know you disagree with them a well.  
20110114013626.000|20110114013628.000|TR0|But the numbers are kind of staggering.  
20110114013628.000|20110114013630.000|TR0|Just take a listen.
20110114013630.000|20110114013632.000|TR0|
20110114013632.000|20110114013635.000|TR0|For every age group where there are more 
20110114013635.000|20110114013637.000|TR0|guns, there are more accidental deaths.  
20110114013637.000|20110114013639.000|TR0|In 2009, the most recent year for which we 
20110114013639.000|20110114013642.000|TR0|have real numbers, 18,610 people were 
20110114013642.000|20110114013644.000|TR0|wounded in unintentional shooting. So -- 
20110114013644.000|20110114013646.000|TR0|and I think there were also, in the year 
20110114013646.000|20110114013648.000|TR0|before that, there were over 600 deaths.  
20110114013648.000|20110114013651.000|TR0|Isn't it clear that the more guns there 
20110114013651.000|20110114013653.000|TR0|are out there the more death and injuries 
20110114013653.000|20110114013655.000|TR0|are caused accidentally?  And isn't that a 
20110114013655.000|20110114013657.000|TR0|risk we've just got to consider in who has 
20110114013657.000|20110114013700.000|TR0|access to guns?
20110114013700.000|20110114013702.000|TR0|
20110114013702.000|20110114013704.000|TR0|KORWIN:  Well, you have a set of 
20110114013704.000|20110114013707.000|TR0|statistics there and you catch me without 
20110114013707.000|20110114013709.000|TR0|another set.  But when you look at 
20110114013709.000|20110114013711.000|TR0|statistics the Brady group comes up with 
20110114013711.000|20110114013713.000|TR0|and they're well recognized as a highly 
20110114013713.000|20110114013716.000|TR0|biased group, their statistics are 
20110114013716.000|20110114013718.000|TR0|brilliant.  When you look at the NRA 
20110114013718.000|20110114013720.000|TR0|statistics and they're a highly 
20110114013720.000|20110114013722.000|TR0|controversial group as well, their 
20110114013722.000|20110114013725.000|TR0|statistics are brilliant.  And neither of 
20110114013725.000|20110114013727.000|TR0|those statistics match.  So putting your 
20110114013727.000|20110114013729.000|TR0|rights into a statistical argument, I 
20110114013729.000|20110114013731.000|TR0|don't think is a good idea.  And if the 
20110114013731.000|20110114013734.000|TR0|numbers you just cited are correct, then 
20110114013734.000|20110114013736.000|TR0|Americans need more training, more 
20110114013736.000|20110114013738.000|TR0|classes.  We need more trainers on the 
20110114013738.000|20110114013741.000|TR0|ground.  A person should know how to 
20110114013741.000|20110114013743.000|TR0|safely handle a firearm, how to keep them 
20110114013743.000|20110114013745.000|TR0|safe in the home.
20110114013745.000|20110114013747.000|TR0|
20110114013747.000|20110114013750.000|TR0|There are 100 million guns in America -- 
20110114013750.000|20110114013752.000|TR0|more than 100 million guns, in 100 million 
20110114013752.000|20110114013754.000|TR0|homes.  And so the statistical percentages 
20110114013754.000|20110114013756.000|TR0|are very low, but there are tragedies 
20110114013756.000|20110114013759.000|TR0|every single one and it shows the need for 
20110114013759.000|20110114013801.000|TR0|more training.
20110114013801.000|20110114013803.000|TR0|
20110114013803.000|20110114013806.000|TR0|We have a program here in Arizona, the 
20110114013806.000|20110114013808.000|TR0|TrainMeAZ.com campaign, to train everybody 
20110114013808.000|20110114013810.000|TR0|in Arizona to know how to use a firearm 
20110114013810.000|20110114013812.000|TR0|safely. Whether you want one or not, you 
20110114013812.000|20110114013815.000|TR0|should understand how to use it.
20110114013815.000|20110114013817.000|TR0|
20110114013817.000|20110114013819.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, Alan, I --
20110114013819.000|20110114013821.000|TR0|
20110114013821.000|20110114013824.000|TR0|KORWIN:  Doesn't that make sense?
20110114013824.000|20110114013826.000|TR0|
20110114013826.000|20110114013828.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Sure it does.  Look, not in 
20110114013828.000|20110114013831.000|TR0|entirety but I agree with you we want a 
20110114013831.000|20110114013833.000|TR0|lot more training.  And I think that at 
20110114013833.000|20110114013835.000|TR0|this moment, even those who are 
20110114013835.000|20110114013837.000|TR0|traditionally in favor of gun control 
20110114013837.000|20110114013840.000|TR0|would be very happy to get bipartisan 
20110114013840.000|20110114013842.000|TR0|support to require training before people 
20110114013842.000|20110114013844.000|TR0|bought something like a Glock with 10, 20 
20110114013844.000|20110114013846.000|TR0|or 30 bullets, you know, in the cartridge, 
20110114013846.000|20110114013849.000|TR0|in the magazine.  So I think maybe we can 
20110114013849.000|20110114013851.000|TR0|at least agree on that much right now to 
20110114013851.000|20110114013853.000|TR0|knock down the number of these accidental 
20110114013853.000|20110114013855.000|TR0|shootings.  What do you think about that?
20110114013855.000|20110114013858.000|TR0|
20110114013858.000|20110114013900.000|TR0|KORWIN:  I would rather see the free 
20110114013900.000|20110114013902.000|TR0|market do it because when government gets 
20110114013902.000|20110114013905.000|TR0|involved it doesn't really run as well, in 
20110114013905.000|20110114013907.000|TR0|my opinion, or as experience has shown.  
20110114013907.000|20110114013909.000|TR0|We had government-mandated classes here in 
20110114013909.000|20110114013911.000|TR0|Arizona for many years and they didn't 
20110114013911.000|20110114013914.000|TR0|cover all sorts of very important 
20110114013914.000|20110114013916.000|TR0|subjects.  But that was the mandated 
20110114013916.000|20110114013918.000|TR0|class.  If you went to a privately-run 
20110114013918.000|20110114013920.000|TR0|class and went to an instructor, you got 
20110114013920.000|20110114013923.000|TR0|much better training, more in-depth 
20110114013923.000|20110114013925.000|TR0|training.
20110114013925.000|20110114013927.000|TR0|
20110114013927.000|20110114013930.000|TR0|And I'm a kind of free market type of guy. 
20110114013930.000|20110114013932.000|TR0| If you want America trained, let's go to 
20110114013932.000|20110114013934.000|TR0|the trainers who are certified, the people 
20110114013934.000|20110114013936.000|TR0|who know what they're doing.  We have them 
20110114013936.000|20110114013939.000|TR0|all listed on Web sites. That's the way to 
20110114013939.000|20110114013941.000|TR0|pursue it, not to have government 
20110114013941.000|20110114013943.000|TR0|bureaucrats somewhere else decide you must 
20110114013943.000|20110114013945.000|TR0|study a, b, c and d, and assume that's 
20110114013945.000|20110114013948.000|TR0|correct.  I would even see it in the 
20110114013948.000|20110114013950.000|TR0|schools, and Arizona has a marksmanship 
20110114013950.000|20110114013952.000|TR0|program for high school students that's a 
20110114013952.000|20110114013954.000|TR0|full semester long.  Let them take that 
20110114013954.000|20110114013957.000|TR0|and learn that way.

20110114013959.000|20110114014001.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, Alan, I'm all for private 
20110114014001.000|20110114014004.000|TR0|instructors, but I wouldn't mind seeing 
20110114014004.000|20110114014006.000|TR0|people be required to have training before 
20110114014006.000|20110114014008.000|TR0|they buy a gun.  But thanks so much for

20110114014107.000|20110114014109.000|TR0|SPITZER:  The events Arizona led to a 
20110114014109.000|20110114014112.000|TR0|bizarre moment in today's White House 
20110114014112.000|20110114014114.000|TR0|press briefing.  A Russian reporter asked 
20110114014114.000|20110114014116.000|TR0|a question that stunned the entire room 
20110114014116.000|20110114014118.000|TR0|and caught Robert Gibbs off-guard.

20110114014121.000|20110114014123.000|TR0|Our senior White House correspondent Ed 
20110114014123.000|20110114014125.000|TR0|Henry was there and he joins us now to 
20110114014125.000|20110114014128.000|TR0|tell us all about it.
20110114014128.000|20110114014130.000|TR0|
20110114014130.000|20110114014132.000|TR0|Ed, exactly what happened?
20110114014132.000|20110114014134.000|TR0|
20110114014134.000|20110114014137.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110114014137.000|20110114014139.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Eliot, it was so surreal.  
20110114014139.000|20110114014141.000|TR0|I was in the front row.  You could almost 
20110114014141.000|20110114014143.000|TR0|feel a chill in the room in the sense that 
20110114014143.000|20110114014146.000|TR0|it was like the cold war was back maybe 
20110114014146.000|20110114014148.000|TR0|just for a few moments.  This Russian 
20110114014148.000|20110114014150.000|TR0|reporter grilling the American press 
20110114014150.000|20110114014153.000|TR0|secretary and basically saying, look, 
20110114014153.000|20110114014155.000|TR0|coming out of Tucson, certainly, it's all 
20110114014155.000|20110114014157.000|TR0|American to have freedom of speech.  But 
20110114014157.000|20110114014159.000|TR0|he said it was also American to have 
20110114014159.000|20110114014202.000|TR0|someone who's deranged and act on it in a 
20110114014202.000|20110114014204.000|TR0|violent way.  That seemed to be suggesting 
20110114014204.000|20110114014206.000|TR0|that maybe in Russia where there's less 
20110114014206.000|20110114014208.000|TR0|freedom they don't have the same problems. 
20110114014208.000|20110114014211.000|TR0| It stunned reporters like myself in the 
20110114014211.000|20110114014213.000|TR0|room, but it also stunned a clearly 
20110114014213.000|20110114014215.000|TR0|emotional Robert Gibbs.

20110114014222.000|20110114014224.000|TR0|ANDREI SITOV, ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY:  
20110114014224.000|20110114014227.000|TR0|First, my condolences to all the 
20110114014227.000|20110114014229.000|TR0|Americans, especially obviously to the 
20110114014229.000|20110114014231.000|TR0|victims.  But second as to why, it does 
20110114014231.000|20110114014233.000|TR0|not seem all that incomprehensible, at 
20110114014233.000|20110114014236.000|TR0|least from the outside.  It's the reverse 
20110114014236.000|20110114014238.000|TR0|side of freedom.  Unless you want 
20110114014238.000|20110114014240.000|TR0|restrictions, unless you want the bigger 
20110114014240.000|20110114014242.000|TR0|role for the government --

20110114014245.000|20110114014247.000|TR0|ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: 
20110114014247.000|20110114014249.000|TR0| Don't do this.  Look, I think there's an 
20110114014249.000|20110114014252.000|TR0|investigation that's going to go on.  
20110114014252.000|20110114014254.000|TR0|There's a -- hold on.  Let me take my time 
20110114014254.000|20110114014256.000|TR0|back just for a second.
20110114014256.000|20110114014258.000|TR0|
20110114014258.000|20110114014301.000|TR0|I think there's an investigation that's 
20110114014301.000|20110114014303.000|TR0|going to go on.  I think there are.  I 
20110114014303.000|20110114014305.000|TR0|think, as it goes on, we will learn more 
20110114014305.000|20110114014307.000|TR0|and more about what happened.  I think as 
20110114014307.000|20110114014310.000|TR0|the president was clear last night, we may 
20110114014310.000|20110114014312.000|TR0|never know.
20110114014312.000|20110114014314.000|TR0|
20110114014314.000|20110114014317.000|TR0|SITOV:  This is America.  The democracy, 
20110114014317.000|20110114014319.000|TR0|the freedom of speech, the freedom of 
20110114014319.000|20110114014321.000|TR0|assembly, the freedom to petition your 
20110114014321.000|20110114014323.000|TR0|government.  And many people outside would 
20110114014323.000|20110114014326.000|TR0|also say, and the quote, unquote, freedom 
20110114014326.000|20110114014328.000|TR0|of a deranged mind to react in a violent 
20110114014328.000|20110114014330.000|TR0|way is also American.  How would you 
20110114014330.000|20110114014332.000|TR0|respond to that?
20110114014332.000|20110114014335.000|TR0|
20110114014335.000|20110114014337.000|TR0|GIBBS:  I'm sorry, what's the last part?
20110114014337.000|20110114014339.000|TR0|
20110114014339.000|20110114014341.000|TR0|SITOV:  The quote, unquote freedom of the 
20110114014341.000|20110114014344.000|TR0|deranged mind to react violently to them, 
20110114014344.000|20110114014346.000|TR0|it is also American.
20110114014346.000|20110114014348.000|TR0|
20110114014348.000|20110114014351.000|TR0|GIBBS:  No, it's not.
20110114014351.000|20110114014353.000|TR0|
20110114014353.000|20110114014355.000|TR0|No, no, I would disagree vehemently with 
20110114014355.000|20110114014357.000|TR0|that.  There are -- there is nothing in 
20110114014357.000|20110114014400.000|TR0|the values of our country, there is 
20110114014400.000|20110114014402.000|TR0|nothing on the many laws on our books that 
20110114014402.000|20110114014404.000|TR0|would provide for somebody to impugn and 
20110114014404.000|20110114014406.000|TR0|impede on the very freedoms that you began 
20110114014406.000|20110114014409.000|TR0|with by exercising the actions that that 
20110114014409.000|20110114014411.000|TR0|individual took on that day.  That is -- 
20110114014411.000|20110114014413.000|TR0|that is not American.  There are, I think 
20110114014413.000|20110114014416.000|TR0|there's agreement on all sides of the 
20110114014416.000|20110114014418.000|TR0|political spectrum.  Violence is never, 
20110114014418.000|20110114014420.000|TR0|ever acceptable.
20110114014420.000|20110114014422.000|TR0|
20110114014422.000|20110114014425.000|TR0|We had people that died.  We had people 
20110114014425.000|20110114014427.000|TR0|whose lives will be changed forever 
20110114014427.000|20110114014429.000|TR0|because of the deranged actions of a 
20110114014429.000|20110114014431.000|TR0|madman.  Those are not American.  Those 
20110114014431.000|20110114014434.000|TR0|are not in keeping with the important 
20110114014434.000|20110114014436.000|TR0|bedrock values by which this country was 
20110114014436.000|20110114014438.000|TR0|founded and by which its citizens live 
20110114014438.000|20110114014441.000|TR0|each and every day of their lives in hopes 
20110114014441.000|20110114014443.000|TR0|of something better for those that are 
20110114014443.000|20110114014445.000|TR0|here.  Thank you.

20110114014452.000|20110114014454.000|TR0|HENRY:  Now, I spoke to the reporter 
20110114014454.000|20110114014456.000|TR0|later.  He said, look, all -- the only 
20110114014456.000|20110114014459.000|TR0|point he was trying to make was that if 
20110114014459.000|20110114014501.000|TR0|Americans want to clamp down on this, 
20110114014501.000|20110114014503.000|TR0|we're going to need more gun control.  
20110114014503.000|20110114014505.000|TR0|And, by the way, Robert Gibbs pushing back 
20110114014505.000|20110114014508.000|TR0|so hard he was able to sort of duck that 
20110114014508.000|20110114014510.000|TR0|broader issue of gun control.  But the 
20110114014510.000|20110114014512.000|TR0|manner in which this reporter approached 
20110114014512.000|20110114014515.000|TR0|it, especially now when emotions are still 
20110114014515.000|20110114014517.000|TR0|so raw just a few days after the tragedy 
20110114014517.000|20110114014519.000|TR0|seemed just a bit over the top.  And 
20110114014519.000|20110114014521.000|TR0|that's why you saw such a strong reaction 
20110114014521.000|20110114014524.000|TR0|from him to say the least.     PARKER:  
20110114014524.000|20110114014526.000|TR0|Just a bit.  Good for Robert Gibbs.  Yes.
20110114014526.000|20110114014528.000|TR0|
20110114014528.000|20110114014530.000|TR0|HENRY:  Yes.
20110114014530.000|20110114014533.000|TR0|
20110114014533.000|20110114014535.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.  Couldn't agree more. 
20110114014535.000|20110114014537.000|TR0| I think Robert Gibbs handled it just 
20110114014537.000|20110114014540.000|TR0|right.  And the amazing thing is I don't 
20110114014540.000|20110114014542.000|TR0|think most folks would even realize a 
20110114014542.000|20110114014544.000|TR0|foreign reporter can go into the White 
20110114014544.000|20110114014546.000|TR0|House and ask questions of our national 
20110114014546.000|20110114014549.000|TR0|leadership.  I bet you one thing they do 
20110114014549.000|20110114014551.000|TR0|not do that in Russia.  All right.

20110114014553.000|20110114014555.000|TR0|HENRY:  Freedom of speech here for sure.

20110114014618.000|20110114014620.000|TR0|need to rank them accordingly.  We'll find 
20110114014620.000|20110114014623.000|TR0|out just what measurements he'd use and 
20110114014623.000|20110114014625.000|TR0|why.  Coming up next.

20110114014657.000|20110114014659.000|TR0|Welcome, Stephen.
20110114014659.000|20110114014701.000|TR0|
20110114014701.000|20110114014704.000|TR0|STEPHEN L. CARTER, AUTHOR, "THE VIOLENCE 
20110114014704.000|20110114014706.000|TR0|OF PEACE":  Thanks very much.  Thank you 
20110114014706.000|20110114014708.000|TR0|for having me on.
20110114014708.000|20110114014710.000|TR0|
20110114014710.000|20110114014713.000|TR0|PARKER:  We've all learned that there's a 
20110114014713.000|20110114014715.000|TR0|big difference between campaigning and 
20110114014715.000|20110114014717.000|TR0|governing.  And the former anti-war Barack 
20110114014717.000|20110114014719.000|TR0|Obama has become the pro-war President 
20110114014719.000|20110114014722.000|TR0|Obama.  What do you think happened?
20110114014722.000|20110114014724.000|TR0|
20110114014724.000|20110114014726.000|TR0|CARTER:  It's really quite striking.  And 
20110114014726.000|20110114014728.000|TR0|I think maybe the best example of it is if 
20110114014728.000|20110114014731.000|TR0|you look at the speech that President 
20110114014731.000|20110114014733.000|TR0|Obama gave when he won the Nobel Prize in 
20110114014733.000|20110114014735.000|TR0|December 2009, he had a little line in the 
20110114014735.000|20110114014738.000|TR0|speech, a fascinating line in what he said 
20110114014738.000|20110114014740.000|TR0|there is evil in the world and sometimes 
20110114014740.000|20110114014742.000|TR0|you have to use military force to combat 
20110114014742.000|20110114014744.000|TR0|it.  And that sounds so much like George 
20110114014744.000|20110114014747.000|TR0|W. Bush.
20110114014747.000|20110114014749.000|TR0|
20110114014749.000|20110114014751.000|TR0|PARKER:  Bush.
20110114014751.000|20110114014753.000|TR0|
20110114014753.000|20110114014756.000|TR0|CARTER:  And I think what happened, this 
20110114014756.000|20110114014758.000|TR0|is not a criticism of either man.  I think 
20110114014758.000|20110114014800.000|TR0|what happens is that once a president gets 
20110114014800.000|20110114014803.000|TR0|into the White House and sees the actual 
20110114014803.000|20110114014805.000|TR0|breadth of threats that exist in the 
20110114014805.000|20110114014807.000|TR0|world, the world starts to look like a 
20110114014807.000|20110114014809.000|TR0|different place and the question of how 
20110114014809.000|20110114014812.000|TR0|you deploy America's military starts to 
20110114014812.000|20110114014814.000|TR0|look maybe a little different than it did 
20110114014814.000|20110114014816.000|TR0|in the course of campaigning.     What I'm 
20110114014816.000|20110114014818.000|TR0|trying to do in this book is to ask the 
20110114014818.000|20110114014821.000|TR0|question that President Obama in that 
20110114014821.000|20110114014823.000|TR0|address challenges to ask, which is where 
20110114014823.000|20110114014825.000|TR0|do we find the moral framework for 
20110114014825.000|20110114014828.000|TR0|evaluating these things, things that 
20110114014828.000|20110114014830.000|TR0|presidents feel they must do?  Wars that 
20110114014830.000|20110114014832.000|TR0|presidents feel they must fight as 
20110114014832.000|20110114014834.000|TR0|President Obama has said about Afghanistan 
20110114014834.000|20110114014837.000|TR0|to find a moral framework for that 
20110114014837.000|20110114014839.000|TR0|evaluation.
20110114014839.000|20110114014841.000|TR0|
20110114014841.000|20110114014843.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, you've been critical of the 
20110114014843.000|20110114014846.000|TR0|president for not having a well-defined 
20110114014846.000|20110114014848.000|TR0|philosophy of war.  I mean, he did talk 
20110114014848.000|20110114014850.000|TR0|about just war in that speech.  But has he 
20110114014850.000|20110114014852.000|TR0|effectively made the case for what we're 
20110114014852.000|20110114014855.000|TR0|trying to accomplish in Afghanistan and 
20110114014855.000|20110114014857.000|TR0|how it fits into that framework.
20110114014857.000|20110114014859.000|TR0|
20110114014859.000|20110114014902.000|TR0|CARTER:  What you see with the president 
20110114014902.000|20110114014904.000|TR0|is a repeated emphasis on the necessity of 
20110114014904.000|20110114014906.000|TR0|winning the war in Afghanistan.  He 
20110114014906.000|20110114014908.000|TR0|referred to it as a war of necessity, a 
20110114014908.000|20110114014911.000|TR0|war that was forced on us, a war we have 
20110114014911.000|20110114014913.000|TR0|no choice but to win.  But at the same 
20110114014913.000|20110114014915.000|TR0|time that he insists on that view, he's 
20110114014915.000|20110114014917.000|TR0|also taken the view that on the other hand 
20110114014917.000|20110114014920.000|TR0|we're going to be out by 2014.  And you 
20110114014920.000|20110114014922.000|TR0|really can't do both.  You have to have a 
20110114014922.000|20110114014924.000|TR0|view either this is a war that's crucial 
20110114014924.000|20110114014927.000|TR0|to win, in which case you go all in.  Or 
20110114014927.000|20110114014929.000|TR0|it's a war that was a great mistake, in 
20110114014929.000|20110114014931.000|TR0|which case you begin in a serious way to 
20110114014931.000|20110114014933.000|TR0|withdraw.  And I think the president ought 
20110114014933.000|20110114014936.000|TR0|to choose one of those two courses as it 
20110114014936.000|20110114014938.000|TR0|were to ride.
20110114014938.000|20110114014940.000|TR0|
20110114014940.000|20110114014942.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Look, the Oslo speech where he 
20110114014942.000|20110114014945.000|TR0|accepted the Nobel Peace Prize was a 
20110114014945.000|20110114014947.000|TR0|beautiful speech and laid out, as you 
20110114014947.000|20110114014949.000|TR0|said, both the historical and the current 
20110114014949.000|20110114014951.000|TR0|rationale for just war which is sometimes 
20110114014951.000|20110114014954.000|TR0|a difficult concept for people.  But what 
20110114014954.000|20110114014956.000|TR0|theory of just war now would apply to 
20110114014956.000|20110114014958.000|TR0|Afghanistan as the president articulated?  
20110114014958.000|20110114015001.000|TR0|Is it any longer a war of self defense in 
20110114015001.000|20110114015003.000|TR0|your view?
20110114015003.000|20110114015005.000|TR0|
20110114015005.000|20110114015007.000|TR0|CARTER:  That's a fair question.  The 
20110114015007.000|20110114015010.000|TR0|president said that a just war has to be a 
20110114015010.000|20110114015012.000|TR0|war that's a last resort and is for a just 
20110114015012.000|20110114015014.000|TR0|cause. There's a part of the just war 
20110114015014.000|20110114015016.000|TR0|theory.  It's a very important part. And I 
20110114015016.000|20110114015019.000|TR0|think that the question about whether 
20110114015019.000|20110114015021.000|TR0|Afghanistan fits that definition, which is 
20110114015021.000|20110114015023.000|TR0|something all of us have strong opinions 
20110114015023.000|20110114015026.000|TR0|on, is exactly the kind of question that I 
20110114015026.000|20110114015028.000|TR0|think we need to be debating.  We don't 
20110114015028.000|20110114015030.000|TR0|debate enough.
20110114015030.000|20110114015032.000|TR0|
20110114015032.000|20110114015035.000|TR0|The ideal I think is to find ways to talk 
20110114015035.000|20110114015037.000|TR0|about issues of war and peace without 
20110114015037.000|20110114015039.000|TR0|resorting to the kind of effort to gain 
20110114015039.000|20110114015041.000|TR0|partisan advantage all the time.  There 
20110114015041.000|20110114015044.000|TR0|used to be this idea that politics stops 
20110114015044.000|20110114015046.000|TR0|at the water's edge.  I'm not saying I 
20110114015046.000|20110114015048.000|TR0|want you to oppose a war. If it's a bad 
20110114015048.000|20110114015051.000|TR0|idea, we should fight against it.  But we 
20110114015051.000|20110114015053.000|TR0|need to find ways to discuss war, to talk 
20110114015053.000|20110114015055.000|TR0|about war within a framework like the just 
20110114015055.000|20110114015057.000|TR0|war framework without simply thinking 
20110114015057.000|20110114015100.000|TR0|about what makes our side of the debate 
20110114015100.000|20110114015102.000|TR0|better off.
20110114015102.000|20110114015104.000|TR0|
20110114015104.000|20110114015106.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, that's part of what you do 
20110114015106.000|20110114015109.000|TR0|in this book as you give us language to 
20110114015109.000|20110114015111.000|TR0|use and talking about it.  And you insist 
20110114015111.000|20110114015113.000|TR0|that the larger American public needs to 
20110114015113.000|20110114015115.000|TR0|be a part of that discussion, shouldn't 
20110114015115.000|20110114015118.000|TR0|just be happening in the halls of 
20110114015118.000|20110114015120.000|TR0|Congress.  When you talk about a war of 
20110114015120.000|20110114015122.000|TR0|last resort, did Iraq qualify as a just 
20110114015122.000|20110114015125.000|TR0|war in any way?
20110114015125.000|20110114015127.000|TR0|
20110114015127.000|20110114015129.000|TR0|CARTER:  I think it's very difficult to 
20110114015129.000|20110114015131.000|TR0|make the case that Iraq was a war of last 
20110114015131.000|20110114015134.000|TR0|resort.  But I'm not entirely sure 
20110114015134.000|20110114015136.000|TR0|Afghanistan was either.  But the question 
20110114015136.000|20110114015138.000|TR0|isn't so much what I think.  The question 
20110114015138.000|20110114015140.000|TR0|is where is the form?  Where do we discuss 
20110114015140.000|20110114015143.000|TR0|these issues in a way that's actually 
20110114015143.000|20110114015145.000|TR0|helpful to those who are making actual 
20110114015145.000|20110114015147.000|TR0|policy?  That I think is what we need to 
20110114015147.000|20110114015150.000|TR0|try to find room to do.
20110114015150.000|20110114015152.000|TR0|
20110114015152.000|20110114015154.000|TR0|SPITZER:  What's interesting -- in the 
20110114015154.000|20110114015156.000|TR0|section, the pivotal section of the 
20110114015156.000|20110114015159.000|TR0|president's speech in Oslo, where he 
20110114015159.000|20110114015201.000|TR0|defines just war, he talks about last 
20110114015201.000|20110114015203.000|TR0|resort and self defense.  There's much 
20110114015203.000|20110114015205.000|TR0|less in there about spreading virtues of 
20110114015205.000|20110114015208.000|TR0|democracy, freedom, sort of the world one 
20110114015208.000|20110114015210.000|TR0|would create with war which have been 
20110114015210.000|20110114015212.000|TR0|President Bush's sort of articulated 
20110114015212.000|20110114015215.000|TR0|foreign policy frame.  President Obama is 
20110114015215.000|20110114015217.000|TR0|a much more self-defense oriented speech 
20110114015217.000|20110114015219.000|TR0|which actually makes it harder for him, I 
20110114015219.000|20110114015221.000|TR0|think, right now to justify a war against 
20110114015221.000|20110114015224.000|TR0|just the Taliban in Afghanistan.
20110114015224.000|20110114015226.000|TR0|
20110114015226.000|20110114015228.000|TR0|CARTER:  I think there's something to 
20110114015228.000|20110114015230.000|TR0|that.  The Bush doctrine much maligned had 
20110114015230.000|20110114015233.000|TR0|two separate aspects.  One of them which 
20110114015233.000|20110114015235.000|TR0|President Obama has endorsed 
20110114015235.000|20110114015237.000|TR0|wholeheartedly is attacking our enemies 
20110114015237.000|20110114015239.000|TR0|before they can attack us.  He's used that 
20110114015239.000|20110114015242.000|TR0|same language a lot of times.  Used more 
20110114015242.000|20110114015244.000|TR0|drone attacks than President Bush ever 
20110114015244.000|20110114015246.000|TR0|did.  A lot of things like that.  The 
20110114015246.000|20110114015249.000|TR0|other part to spread democracy, he's been 
20110114015249.000|20110114015251.000|TR0|less attuned to, less interested in 
20110114015251.000|20110114015253.000|TR0|perhaps.  But then you get the 
20110114015253.000|20110114015255.000|TR0|complication what's going on in 
20110114015255.000|20110114015258.000|TR0|Afghanistan.  Afghanistan, we're fighting 
20110114015258.000|20110114015300.000|TR0|a war, problems in the government that 
20110114015300.000|20110114015302.000|TR0|everyone agrees is quite a corrupt 
20110114015302.000|20110114015304.000|TR0|government. And I don't know any way that 
20110114015304.000|20110114015307.000|TR0|you can work with it without increasing 
20110114015307.000|20110114015309.000|TR0|that corruption.  You can decide that's 
20110114015309.000|20110114015311.000|TR0|the cost of doing business you have to do 
20110114015311.000|20110114015314.000|TR0|that.  But again, that's the sort of thing 
20110114015314.000|20110114015316.000|TR0|I think that we ought to be debating.
20110114015316.000|20110114015318.000|TR0|
20110114015318.000|20110114015320.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Interestingly, the framework of 
20110114015320.000|20110114015323.000|TR0|just war might apply more readily to Iraq 
20110114015323.000|20110114015325.000|TR0|if one were to believe there were weapons 
20110114015325.000|20110114015327.000|TR0|of mass destruction.  Obviously, we found 
20110114015327.000|20110114015329.000|TR0|that there weren't.  But if you believe 
20110114015329.000|20110114015332.000|TR0|that the leadership of the country 
20110114015332.000|20110114015334.000|TR0|actually believed that, then the 
20110114015334.000|20110114015336.000|TR0|definition of just war that President 
20110114015336.000|20110114015338.000|TR0|Obama laid out, arguably could have 
20110114015338.000|20110114015341.000|TR0|justified that war.
20110114015341.000|20110114015343.000|TR0|
20110114015343.000|20110114015345.000|TR0|CARTER:  Actually there's another part of 
20110114015345.000|20110114015348.000|TR0|Obama's speech which is quite interesting 
20110114015348.000|20110114015350.000|TR0|on this.  President Obama pointed out 
20110114015350.000|20110114015352.000|TR0|correctly that the just war tradition 
20110114015352.000|20110114015354.000|TR0|sometimes allows the use of force not just 
20110114015354.000|20110114015357.000|TR0|in self defense, but actually requires the 
20110114015357.000|20110114015359.000|TR0|use of force to defend other people who 
20110114015359.000|20110114015401.000|TR0|are suffering.  If you look at the early 
20110114015401.000|20110114015403.000|TR0|writers on just war, we're talking about a 
20110114015403.000|20110114015406.000|TR0|couple thousand years ago, a lot of them 
20110114015406.000|20110114015408.000|TR0|actually thought that defending others was 
20110114015408.000|20110114015410.000|TR0|a higher cause than defending the self.  
20110114015410.000|20110114015413.000|TR0|And that's something I think we ought to 
20110114015413.000|20110114015415.000|TR0|think about two.
20110114015415.000|20110114015417.000|TR0|
20110114015417.000|20110114015419.000|TR0|PARKER:  And where does nation-building 
20110114015419.000|20110114015422.000|TR0|fit into that whole definition?
20110114015422.000|20110114015424.000|TR0|
20110114015424.000|20110114015426.000|TR0|CARTER:  I think nation-building fits into 
20110114015426.000|20110114015428.000|TR0|it poorly.  It's difficult to imagine that 
20110114015428.000|20110114015431.000|TR0|you can without an enormous commitment of 
20110114015431.000|20110114015433.000|TR0|force create a nation by force.
20110114015433.000|20110114015435.000|TR0|
20110114015435.000|20110114015438.000|TR0|Now, we did it after World War II.  But 
20110114015438.000|20110114015440.000|TR0|that was with an enormous troop 
20110114015440.000|20110114015442.000|TR0|commitment.  That wasn't with the kind of 
20110114015442.000|20110114015444.000|TR0|limited engagement that we're willing to 
20110114015444.000|20110114015447.000|TR0|do today.  I think that -- if the war in 
20110114015447.000|20110114015449.000|TR0|Afghanistan is a war to keep the Taliban 
20110114015449.000|20110114015451.000|TR0|from seizing power, we have to have clear 
20110114015451.000|20110114015453.000|TR0|benchmarks.  I shouldn't use that word.  
20110114015453.000|20110114015456.000|TR0|It's too politically freighted.  But we 
20110114015456.000|20110114015458.000|TR0|have to have a clear vision from the 
20110114015458.000|20110114015500.000|TR0|president, this would count as victory.  
20110114015500.000|20110114015502.000|TR0|And this is how I'm going to attain it.
20110114015502.000|20110114015505.000|TR0|
20110114015505.000|20110114015507.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.  We have to take a 
20110114015507.000|20110114015509.000|TR0|quick break.  We'll continue our 
20110114015509.000|20110114015512.000|TR0|conversation with Stephen Carter in just a 
20110114015512.000|20110114015514.000|TR0|moment.  We'll be right back.
20110114015514.000|20110114015516.000|TR0|
20110114015516.000|20110114015518.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110114015518.000|20110114015521.000|TR0|
20110114015521.000|20110114015523.000|TR0|PARKER:  We're back with author Stephen L. 
20110114015523.000|20110114015525.000|TR0|Carter.
20110114015525.000|20110114015527.000|TR0|
20110114015527.000|20110114015530.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Professor, I just got to read 
20110114015530.000|20110114015532.000|TR0|and quote something from your book here.  
20110114015532.000|20110114015534.000|TR0|Fascinating, the whole book is 
20110114015534.000|20110114015537.000|TR0|fascinating.  But you say you're talking 
20110114015537.000|20110114015539.000|TR0|about terrorism and the choice of going to 
20110114015539.000|20110114015541.000|TR0|war. The true absolutist is rare.  And 
20110114015541.000|20110114015543.000|TR0|then you continue on.  But I want to 
20110114015543.000|20110114015546.000|TR0|quote, "This position is in its way Nobel 
20110114015546.000|20110114015548.000|TR0|but it fails to partake of the reality 
20110114015548.000|20110114015550.000|TR0|that we have no choice but to rank evils."
20110114015550.000|20110114015552.000|TR0|
20110114015552.000|20110114015555.000|TR0|That's a remarkably important observation. 
20110114015555.000|20110114015557.000|TR0| I think it's absolutely correct.  But 
20110114015557.000|20110114015559.000|TR0|does that take you to a conclusion that 
20110114015559.000|20110114015602.000|TR0|you would torture somebody to get the 
20110114015602.000|20110114015604.000|TR0|evidence to stop a bomb from going off, 
20110114015604.000|20110114015606.000|TR0|this sort of quintessential morality 
20110114015606.000|20110114015608.000|TR0|choice that professors love to play with?
20110114015608.000|20110114015611.000|TR0|
20110114015611.000|20110114015613.000|TR0|CARTER:  I wouldn't do it.  I'm an 
20110114015613.000|20110114015615.000|TR0|absolutist on torture.  I think you never 
20110114015615.000|20110114015617.000|TR0|do it.  But I think that people who 
20110114015617.000|20110114015620.000|TR0|believe there's a reasonable scale up to 
20110114015620.000|20110114015622.000|TR0|things like that, they're making an 
20110114015622.000|20110114015624.000|TR0|important argument.  I think we ought to 
20110114015624.000|20110114015626.000|TR0|have that conversation sometimes, 
20110114015626.000|20110114015629.000|TR0|conversations like that instead of just 
20110114015629.000|20110114015631.000|TR0|condemning one side or the other --
20110114015631.000|20110114015633.000|TR0|
20110114015633.000|20110114015636.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You have a fascinating 
20110114015636.000|20110114015638.000|TR0|discussion here about the role of human 
20110114015638.000|20110114015640.000|TR0|intelligence, which is essential to all 
20110114015640.000|20110114015642.000|TR0|these decisions, of course.  But if you're 
20110114015642.000|20110114015645.000|TR0|going to rank evils, do you not then -- 
20110114015645.000|20110114015647.000|TR0|haven't you just said you need to rank the 
20110114015647.000|20110114015649.000|TR0|relative evil of torture against one 
20110114015649.000|20110114015651.000|TR0|individual versus the cataclysm of mass 
20110114015651.000|20110114015654.000|TR0|murder?
20110114015654.000|20110114015656.000|TR0|
20110114015656.000|20110114015658.000|TR0|CARTER:  I think that's right.  I think 
20110114015658.000|20110114015701.000|TR0|that's basically right. Again, I emphasize 
20110114015701.000|20110114015703.000|TR0|I wouldn't do it.
20110114015703.000|20110114015705.000|TR0|
20110114015705.000|20110114015707.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110114015707.000|20110114015710.000|TR0|
20110114015710.000|20110114015712.000|TR0|CARTER:  I would be against it in all 
20110114015712.000|20110114015714.000|TR0|circumstances.  But I think that someone 
20110114015714.000|20110114015716.000|TR0|who doesn't take that view, it's not a 
20110114015716.000|20110114015719.000|TR0|wicked view, it's not an evil view.
20110114015719.000|20110114015721.000|TR0|
20110114015721.000|20110114015723.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110114015723.000|20110114015725.000|TR0|
20110114015725.000|20110114015728.000|TR0|CARTER:  It's a view that helps solve (ph) 
20110114015728.000|20110114015730.000|TR0|the complexity and the difficulty of these 
20110114015730.000|20110114015732.000|TR0|issues.
20110114015732.000|20110114015735.000|TR0|
20110114015735.000|20110114015737.000|TR0|PARKER:  On the subject of evil, President 
20110114015737.000|20110114015739.000|TR0|Obama has mentioned it in his speech.  
20110114015739.000|20110114015741.000|TR0|President Bush used it often.  Is the 
20110114015741.000|20110114015744.000|TR0|concept of evil as relates to war, is that 
20110114015744.000|20110114015746.000|TR0|a new conversation or is that always been 
20110114015746.000|20110114015748.000|TR0|part of our war dialogue?     CARTER:  
20110114015748.000|20110114015750.000|TR0|It's a very old conversation going back to 
20110114015750.000|20110114015753.000|TR0|some of the early debates about just war 
20110114015753.000|20110114015755.000|TR0|theory.  And there is evil in the world. 
20110114015755.000|20110114015757.000|TR0|The president is right about that.  He 
20110114015757.000|20110114015800.000|TR0|also mentioned it in his talk in Tucson.  
20110114015800.000|20110114015802.000|TR0|He mentioned evil in the world as well.
20110114015802.000|20110114015804.000|TR0|
20110114015804.000|20110114015806.000|TR0|There is evil in the word, but the 
20110114015806.000|20110114015809.000|TR0|question of whether you have to use 
20110114015809.000|20110114015811.000|TR0|military force is not determined just by 
20110114015811.000|20110114015813.000|TR0|whether you have identified an evil out 
20110114015813.000|20110114015815.000|TR0|there.  You also have to go through the 
20110114015815.000|20110114015818.000|TR0|other questions of just war tradition 
20110114015818.000|20110114015820.000|TR0|raises, like whether it's a last resort, 
20110114015820.000|20110114015822.000|TR0|where there other less violent ways to 
20110114015822.000|20110114015825.000|TR0|accomplish the same thing.

20110114015827.000|20110114015829.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And I think that the issue in 
20110114015829.000|20110114015831.000|TR0|our limited seconds left that we have not 
20110114015831.000|20110114015834.000|TR0|touched upon is the moral obligation to go 
20110114015834.000|20110114015836.000|TR0|into a situation like Rwanda.  Forget 
20110114015836.000|20110114015838.000|TR0|nation-building, just saving human life, 
20110114015838.000|20110114015840.000|TR0|and whether that is -- there's a moral 
20110114015840.000|20110114015843.000|TR0|compulsion to do that?
20110114015843.000|20110114015845.000|TR0|
20110114015845.000|20110114015847.000|TR0|CARTER:  Bill Clinton said that it was the 
20110114015847.000|20110114015849.000|TR0|biggest mistake of his presidency not 
20110114015849.000|20110114015852.000|TR0|trying to defend Rwanda where a million 
20110114015852.000|20110114015854.000|TR0|people died. And I agree with him.
20110114015854.000|20110114015856.000|TR0|
20110114015856.000|20110114015859.000|TR0|PARKER:  Or the moral obligation to stay 
20110114015859.000|20110114015901.000|TR0|in Iraq to protect the women should the 
20110114015901.000|20110114015903.000|TR0|Taliban resurge.
20110114015903.000|20110114015905.000|TR0|
20110114015905.000|20110114015908.000|TR0|CARTER:  Well, I think that all over the 
20110114015908.000|20110114015910.000|TR0|world, when we get involved, when we have 
20110114015910.000|20110114015912.000|TR0|those questions, we can't be everywhere 
20110114015912.000|20110114015914.000|TR0|but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be 
20110114015914.000|20110114015917.000|TR0|anywhere.
20110114015917.000|20110114015919.000|TR0|
20110114015919.000|20110114015921.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.
20110114015921.000|20110114015924.000|TR0|
20110114015924.000|20110114015926.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right.  Stephen Carter, 
20110114015926.000|20110114015928.000|TR0|thanks so much for being with us.
20110114015928.000|20110114015930.000|TR0|
20110114015930.000|20110114015933.000|TR0|CARTER:  My pleasure, thank you.
20110114015933.000|20110114015935.000|TR0|
20110114015935.000|20110114015937.000|TR0|PARKER:  And thank you for watching.
20110114015937.000|20110114015939.000|TR0|
