20110107140022.000|20110107140024.000|TR0|hearts over the years.

20110107140109.000|20110107140111.000|TR0|MORNING":  He's a newlywed. He's off the 
20110107140111.000|20110107140114.000|TR0|market.  Sorry about that.
20110107140114.000|20110107140116.000|TR0|
20110107140116.000|20110107140118.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  That's why they're crying.  
20110107140118.000|20110107140120.000|TR0|Have a good weekend, guys.
20110107140120.000|20110107140123.000|TR0|
20110107140123.000|20110107140125.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Exactly.
20110107140125.000|20110107140127.000|TR0|
20110107140127.000|20110107140129.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  9:00 a.m. on the East Coast, 
20110107140129.000|20110107140132.000|TR0|6:00 a.m. out West. Here's some of the 
20110107140132.000|20110107140134.000|TR0|stories that have us talking this morning.
20110107140134.000|20110107140136.000|TR0|
20110107140136.000|20110107140138.000|TR0|Two Mississippi sisters now free women 
20110107140138.000|20110107140141.000|TR0|walking out of prison just moments ago on 
20110107140141.000|20110107140143.000|TR0|the promise that they'll share a kidney.  
20110107140143.000|20110107140145.000|TR0|Gladys and Jamie Scott spent 16 years 
20110107140145.000|20110107140147.000|TR0|behind bars for an armed robbery that 
20110107140147.000|20110107140149.000|TR0|netted $11.  They were serving life 
20110107140149.000|20110107140152.000|TR0|sentences.  But Mississippi governor 
20110107140152.000|20110107140154.000|TR0|Hailey Barbour suspended that punishment 
20110107140154.000|20110107140156.000|TR0|in part because of their organ donation 
20110107140156.000|20110107140158.000|TR0|plan.
20110107140158.000|20110107140201.000|TR0|
20110107140201.000|20110107140203.000|TR0|Marty Savidge live at the prison in Pearl, 
20110107140203.000|20110107140205.000|TR0|Mississippi, just outside of Jackson.
20110107140205.000|20110107140207.000|TR0|
20110107140207.000|20110107140210.000|TR0|Marty, kidney transplant means freedom.
20110107140210.000|20110107140212.000|TR0|
20110107140212.000|20110107140214.000|TR0|MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It 
20110107140214.000|20110107140216.000|TR0|does, indeed, Kyra.  In fact, we just 
20110107140216.000|20110107140219.000|TR0|watched as the vehicle that was 
20110107140219.000|20110107140221.000|TR0|transporting the two sisters -- and we're 
20110107140221.000|20110107140223.000|TR0|talking about Jamie and Gladys Scott -- 
20110107140223.000|20110107140225.000|TR0|just left the front main gate as of about 
20110107140225.000|20110107140228.000|TR0|30 seconds ago from the Central 
20110107140228.000|20110107140230.000|TR0|Mississippi Corrections facility here 
20110107140230.000|20110107140232.000|TR0|where they have been for many, many years.
20110107140232.000|20110107140234.000|TR0|
20110107140234.000|20110107140236.000|TR0|So it is the first taste of freedom for 
20110107140236.000|20110107140239.000|TR0|them.  There was no celebration.  There 
20110107140239.000|20110107140241.000|TR0|was no honking of horns and there was no 
20110107140241.000|20110107140243.000|TR0|wild jubilation because they realize that 
20110107140243.000|20110107140245.000|TR0|their release is based on a number of 
20110107140245.000|20110107140248.000|TR0|conditions and at this critical moment 
20110107140248.000|20110107140250.000|TR0|nobody wants to do anything that could 
20110107140250.000|20110107140252.000|TR0|possibly jeopardize or upset the process 
20110107140252.000|20110107140254.000|TR0|that is under way.
20110107140254.000|20110107140257.000|TR0|
20110107140257.000|20110107140259.000|TR0|A long, awaited process that should be 
20110107140259.000|20110107140301.000|TR0|pointed out.
20110107140301.000|20110107140303.000|TR0|
20110107140303.000|20110107140306.000|TR0|What is going to happen now is that the 
20110107140306.000|20110107140308.000|TR0|sisters will be taken into Jackson.  
20110107140308.000|20110107140310.000|TR0|They'll be taken to a place where they can 
20110107140310.000|20110107140312.000|TR0|rest, where they can get some food.  
20110107140312.000|20110107140315.000|TR0|They've also been given a change of 
20110107140315.000|20110107140317.000|TR0|clothing because obviously for the last 16 
20110107140317.000|20110107140319.000|TR0|years they've been in prison attire.
20110107140319.000|20110107140321.000|TR0|
20110107140321.000|20110107140323.000|TR0|And then it is anticipated that there's 
20110107140323.000|20110107140326.000|TR0|going to be a news conference later this 
20110107140326.000|20110107140328.000|TR0|afternoon and it's expected that the 
20110107140328.000|20110107140330.000|TR0|sisters will speak at that time.  However, 
20110107140330.000|20110107140332.000|TR0|we have to point out there's been a lot of 
20110107140332.000|20110107140335.000|TR0|rumors going on that perhaps the 
20110107140335.000|20110107140337.000|TR0|Department of Corrections for the state of 
20110107140337.000|20110107140339.000|TR0|Mississippi or even the governor's office 
20110107140339.000|20110107140341.000|TR0|is not too happy that they will be 
20110107140341.000|20110107140344.000|TR0|speaking out.
20110107140344.000|20110107140346.000|TR0|
20110107140346.000|20110107140348.000|TR0|And so there is still some question as to 
20110107140348.000|20110107140350.000|TR0|how much they will say or how open they 
20110107140350.000|20110107140353.000|TR0|can be about the time that they've been in 
20110107140353.000|20110107140355.000|TR0|prison or how they feel about being 
20110107140355.000|20110107140357.000|TR0|released.  So that's where it stands right 
20110107140357.000|20110107140359.000|TR0|now -- Kyra.
20110107140359.000|20110107140402.000|TR0|
20110107140402.000|20110107140404.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  We'll keep talking 
20110107140404.000|20110107140406.000|TR0|throughout the morning then, Marty.  
20110107140406.000|20110107140408.000|TR0|Thanks so much.
20110107140408.000|20110107140410.000|TR0|
20110107140410.000|20110107140413.000|TR0|Meanwhile this morning, the other huge 
20110107140413.000|20110107140415.000|TR0|job, new measure of the economy just 
20110107140415.000|20110107140417.000|TR0|minutes ago.  We learned that the nation's 
20110107140417.000|20110107140419.000|TR0|jobless rate took a big tumble last month 
20110107140419.000|20110107140422.000|TR0|to 9.4 percent.  That's compared to 9.8 
20110107140422.000|20110107140424.000|TR0|percent in November.  Just over 100,000 
20110107140424.000|20110107140426.000|TR0|jobs were created so this is all good 
20110107140426.000|20110107140428.000|TR0|news.  Right?  Well, not quite.
20110107140428.000|20110107140431.000|TR0|
20110107140431.000|20110107140433.000|TR0|Chief business correspondent Ali Velshi 
20110107140433.000|20110107140435.000|TR0|here to break it all down.  How's it not 
20110107140435.000|20110107140437.000|TR0|good news?
20110107140437.000|20110107140440.000|TR0|
20110107140440.000|20110107140442.000|TR0|ALI VELSHI, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS 
20110107140442.000|20110107140444.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  I'm -- you know me, I'm an 
20110107140444.000|20110107140446.000|TR0|optimist.  I want this to be good news.  
20110107140446.000|20110107140449.000|TR0|And how is it not good news that 100,000 
20110107140449.000|20110107140451.000|TR0|jobs are created?
20110107140451.000|20110107140453.000|TR0|
20110107140453.000|20110107140455.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Right.       VELSHI:  Well, 
20110107140455.000|20110107140457.000|TR0|it's not good news because we wanted 
20110107140457.000|20110107140500.000|TR0|162,000, 165,000, 170,000.  We can't get 
20110107140500.000|20110107140502.000|TR0|back to that low unemployment rate we had 
20110107140502.000|20110107140504.000|TR0|before the -- before the recession started 
20110107140504.000|20110107140506.000|TR0|without 250,000 or 300,000 new jobs a 
20110107140506.000|20110107140509.000|TR0|month, so at this rate, until it picks up, 
20110107140509.000|20110107140511.000|TR0|it's just going to be this slow plodding 
20110107140511.000|20110107140513.000|TR0|recovery.
20110107140513.000|20110107140515.000|TR0|
20110107140515.000|20110107140518.000|TR0|Here's the other thing.  Forget that 
20110107140518.000|20110107140520.000|TR0|unemployment rate.  9.4 percent.  It is a 
20110107140520.000|20110107140522.000|TR0|percentage of the number of people in the 
20110107140522.000|20110107140524.000|TR0|workforce but people have been unemployed 
20110107140524.000|20110107140527.000|TR0|for so long that people are dropping off 
20110107140527.000|20110107140529.000|TR0|the workforce.  So pay attention only to 
20110107140529.000|20110107140531.000|TR0|the number of jobs created.
20110107140531.000|20110107140533.000|TR0|
20110107140533.000|20110107140536.000|TR0|The 9.4 percent, it's a bit of a red 
20110107140536.000|20110107140538.000|TR0|herring.  The unemployment rate.  Yes, 
20110107140538.000|20110107140540.000|TR0|it's down, I'm glad it's down, everybody 
20110107140540.000|20110107140542.000|TR0|is glad it's down.  What you need to see 
20110107140542.000|20110107140545.000|TR0|is that 103,000 jobs were created.  Very 
20110107140545.000|20110107140547.000|TR0|good for the 103,000 people who have new 
20110107140547.000|20110107140549.000|TR0|jobs.
20110107140549.000|20110107140551.000|TR0|
20110107140551.000|20110107140553.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Where are the jobs?
20110107140553.000|20110107140556.000|TR0|
20110107140556.000|20110107140558.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Well, the biggest gainer, 
20110107140558.000|20110107140600.000|TR0|interestingly enough, was in leisure and 
20110107140600.000|20110107140602.000|TR0|hospitality.  The hotel and food industry. 
20110107140602.000|20110107140605.000|TR0| There were jobs in retail that were 
20110107140605.000|20110107140607.000|TR0|added, there were jobs in health care. 
20110107140607.000|20110107140609.000|TR0|Health care, by the way, has not lost a 
20110107140609.000|20110107140611.000|TR0|job in -- I don't know, years. That's a 
20110107140611.000|20110107140614.000|TR0|growing area.
20110107140614.000|20110107140616.000|TR0|
20110107140616.000|20110107140618.000|TR0|Few extra jobs in manufacturing but again 
20110107140618.000|20110107140620.000|TR0|we had 15 years of losses in 
20110107140620.000|20110107140623.000|TR0|manufacturing.  So largely things haven't 
20110107140623.000|20110107140625.000|TR0|changed all that much.  They're up but 
20110107140625.000|20110107140627.000|TR0|they haven't changed all that much.  
20110107140627.000|20110107140629.000|TR0|That's why it's not fantastic.  Because at 
20110107140629.000|20110107140632.000|TR0|this point in the recovery, Kyra, we need 
20110107140632.000|20110107140634.000|TR0|things to change a lot.
20110107140634.000|20110107140636.000|TR0|
20110107140636.000|20110107140638.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Isn't that interesting, though, 
20110107140638.000|20110107140640.000|TR0|about leisure and hospitality?
20110107140640.000|20110107140643.000|TR0|
20110107140643.000|20110107140645.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Yes.
20110107140645.000|20110107140647.000|TR0|
20110107140647.000|20110107140649.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  I mean that tells you something 
20110107140649.000|20110107140652.000|TR0|about the -- the economy.
20110107140652.000|20110107140654.000|TR0|
20110107140654.000|20110107140656.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Tells you people are spending, 
20110107140656.000|20110107140658.000|TR0|right?
20110107140658.000|20110107140701.000|TR0|
20110107140701.000|20110107140703.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Right.
20110107140703.000|20110107140705.000|TR0|
20110107140705.000|20110107140707.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110107140707.000|20110107140710.000|TR0|
20110107140710.000|20110107140712.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  People are spending money.
20110107140712.000|20110107140714.000|TR0|
20110107140714.000|20110107140716.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Yes.  It could be people are 
20110107140716.000|20110107140719.000|TR0|spending money here and that's quite 
20110107140719.000|20110107140721.000|TR0|possible because the savings rate has gone 
20110107140721.000|20110107140723.000|TR0|up.  It could also be we have a low U.S. 
20110107140723.000|20110107140725.000|TR0|dollar so people are coming in.  People 
20110107140725.000|20110107140727.000|TR0|from Canada are coming in, people from 
20110107140727.000|20110107140730.000|TR0|Europe are coming in, people from South 
20110107140730.000|20110107140732.000|TR0|America.
20110107140732.000|20110107140734.000|TR0|
20110107140734.000|20110107140736.000|TR0|It's a good deal to travel in America 
20110107140736.000|20110107140739.000|TR0|right now.  So could be both and I'll look 
20110107140739.000|20110107140741.000|TR0|into it a little more but that tells you 
20110107140741.000|20110107140743.000|TR0|something. People are traveling.       
20110107140743.000|20110107140745.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes.  And also those gas prices 
20110107140745.000|20110107140748.000|TR0|are going up, as well, which is very 
20110107140748.000|20110107140750.000|TR0|frustrating.
20110107140750.000|20110107140752.000|TR0|
20110107140752.000|20110107140754.000|TR0|VELSHI:  And that's going to draw some of 
20110107140754.000|20110107140757.000|TR0|the travel back.
20110107140757.000|20110107140759.000|TR0|
20110107140759.000|20110107140801.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, exactly.  All right.  
20110107140801.000|20110107140803.000|TR0|Thanks, Ali.
20110107140803.000|20110107140806.000|TR0|
20110107140806.000|20110107140808.000|TR0|VELSHI:  OK.
20110107140808.000|20110107140810.000|TR0|
20110107140810.000|20110107140812.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Appreciate it.
20110107140812.000|20110107140814.000|TR0|
20110107140814.000|20110107140817.000|TR0|Well, later this morning, President Obama 
20110107140817.000|20110107140819.000|TR0|will announce key new members of his 
20110107140819.000|20110107140821.000|TR0|economic team.  Among them economist Gene 
20110107140821.000|20110107140823.000|TR0|Sperling. He's expected to be named the 
20110107140823.000|20110107140826.000|TR0|next director of the National Economic 
20110107140826.000|20110107140828.000|TR0|Council.  Sperling held the same position 
20110107140828.000|20110107140830.000|TR0|under former President Clinton.
20110107140830.000|20110107140832.000|TR0|
20110107140832.000|20110107140835.000|TR0|And President Obama has to fill four 
20110107140835.000|20110107140837.000|TR0|high-profile vacancies in his 
20110107140837.000|20110107140839.000|TR0|administration now.  The announcement is 
20110107140839.000|20110107140841.000|TR0|actually scheduled for 11:35 Eastern Time. 
20110107140841.000|20110107140844.000|TR0| You will see it live right here on CNN.
20110107140844.000|20110107140846.000|TR0|
20110107140846.000|20110107140848.000|TR0|And for weeks the bluster has been 
20110107140848.000|20110107140850.000|TR0|building.  We're talking about the battle 
20110107140850.000|20110107140853.000|TR0|lines deepening but today on Capitol Hill 
20110107140853.000|20110107140855.000|TR0|the first real shot is fired in the battle 
20110107140855.000|20110107140857.000|TR0|to repeal health care reform.
20110107140857.000|20110107140859.000|TR0|
20110107140859.000|20110107140901.000|TR0|The Republican leadership of the House is 
20110107140901.000|20110107140904.000|TR0|holding a test vote on a hot point issue 
20110107140904.000|20110107140906.000|TR0|that helped sweep them into power.
20110107140906.000|20110107140908.000|TR0|
20110107140908.000|20110107140910.000|TR0|CNN congressional correspondent Brianna 
20110107140910.000|20110107140913.000|TR0|Keilar just outside the House chamber for 
20110107140913.000|20110107140915.000|TR0|this milestone event.
20110107140915.000|20110107140917.000|TR0|
20110107140917.000|20110107140919.000|TR0|So, Brianna, what happens today exactly?  
20110107140919.000|20110107140922.000|TR0|And let's talk about why it matters to all 
20110107140922.000|20110107140924.000|TR0|of us.
20110107140924.000|20110107140926.000|TR0|
20110107140926.000|20110107140928.000|TR0|BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN CONGRESSIONAL 
20110107140928.000|20110107140931.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kyra, overall, this 
20110107140931.000|20110107140933.000|TR0|is a very big deal because this is the 
20110107140933.000|20110107140935.000|TR0|first vote on a health care repeal and the 
20110107140935.000|20110107140937.000|TR0|vote that we're expecting to take place on 
20110107140937.000|20110107140940.000|TR0|the House floor later this morning is a 
20110107140940.000|20110107140942.000|TR0|vote that says, here's how the actual vote 
20110107140942.000|20110107140944.000|TR0|on the repeal is going to play out next 
20110107140944.000|20110107140946.000|TR0|Wednesday.
20110107140946.000|20110107140948.000|TR0|
20110107140948.000|20110107140951.000|TR0|This is vote -- we call it a vote on the 
20110107140951.000|20110107140953.000|TR0|rule.  I know that doesn't mean a lot to a 
20110107140953.000|20110107140955.000|TR0|lot of people, but what that means is it 
20110107140955.000|20110107140957.000|TR0|lays out all of the parameters and 
20110107140957.000|20110107141000.000|TR0|something that's going to be so 
20110107141000.000|20110107141002.000|TR0|interesting that really caught our eye 
20110107141002.000|20110107141004.000|TR0|here is there is going to be eight hours 
20110107141004.000|20110107141006.000|TR0|of debate next Wednesday.
20110107141006.000|20110107141009.000|TR0|
20110107141009.000|20110107141011.000|TR0|We were kind of joking that it seems like 
20110107141011.000|20110107141013.000|TR0|it's turning into the Senate here.  Eight 
20110107141013.000|20110107141015.000|TR0|hours of debate, this is going to be on 
20110107141015.000|20110107141018.000|TR0|the floor all day next Wednesday, and it's 
20110107141018.000|20110107141020.000|TR0|going to be quite the spectacle.
20110107141020.000|20110107141022.000|TR0|
20110107141022.000|20110107141024.000|TR0|And, Kyra, right now Democrats are sort of 
20110107141024.000|20110107141027.000|TR0|raising objections saying that they have 
20110107141027.000|20110107141029.000|TR0|been shut out of this process.  They did 
20110107141029.000|20110107141031.000|TR0|propose some amendments, some changes to 
20110107141031.000|20110107141033.000|TR0|this very simple repeal in the committee 
20110107141033.000|20110107141035.000|TR0|process and the rules committee but, of 
20110107141035.000|20110107141038.000|TR0|course, not surprisingly, those were shut 
20110107141038.000|20110107141040.000|TR0|down -- Kyra.       PHILLIPS:  And, you 
20110107141040.000|20110107141042.000|TR0|know, the argument on both sides about 
20110107141042.000|20110107141044.000|TR0|health care reform continues, the debate 
20110107141044.000|20110107141047.000|TR0|continues, both sides constantly weighing 
20110107141047.000|20110107141049.000|TR0|in on this.
20110107141049.000|20110107141051.000|TR0|
20110107141051.000|20110107141053.000|TR0|KEILAR:  This has been hammered all week 
20110107141053.000|20110107141056.000|TR0|long.  Republicans, here's what they're 
20110107141056.000|20110107141058.000|TR0|saying.  They're saying that the health 
20110107141058.000|20110107141100.000|TR0|care overhaul is a job killer.  They're 
20110107141100.000|20110107141102.000|TR0|saying that it's unconstitutional. All of 
20110107141102.000|20110107141105.000|TR0|this talk about this constitution.  Why?  
20110107141105.000|20110107141107.000|TR0|Because of that individual mandate.  
20110107141107.000|20110107141109.000|TR0|Because it says all Americans have to get 
20110107141109.000|20110107141111.000|TR0|coverage.
20110107141111.000|20110107141114.000|TR0|
20110107141114.000|20110107141116.000|TR0|And they say that it's going to raise your 
20110107141116.000|20110107141118.000|TR0|taxes.  That it's going to cost more 
20110107141118.000|20110107141120.000|TR0|money.  Of course, Democrats have their 
20110107141120.000|20110107141123.000|TR0|own argument here.  They're saying this 
20110107141123.000|20110107141125.000|TR0|repeal is going to actually add $230 
20110107141125.000|20110107141127.000|TR0|billion to the deficit.  These are numbers

20110107141547.000|20110107141549.000|TR0|it could be a biological way of warding

20110107142209.000|20110107142212.000|TR0|He showed us the court letter and a letter

20110107142241.000|20110107142243.000|TR0|next door was the one that was supposed to 
20110107142243.000|20110107142245.000|TR0|be demolished.  That's no comfort to Hall

20110107142314.000|20110107142317.000|TR0|feeling right now?
20110107142317.000|20110107142319.000|TR0|
20110107142319.000|20110107142321.000|TR0|HALL:  I'm still stunned.  I can't 
20110107142321.000|20110107142323.000|TR0|believe, like, this really happened.
20110107142323.000|20110107142326.000|TR0|
20110107142326.000|20110107142328.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  What did you tell your kids, 
20110107142328.000|20110107142330.000|TR0|Andre?
20110107142330.000|20110107142332.000|TR0|
20110107142332.000|20110107142334.000|TR0|HALL:  I can't even -- I can't even tell 
20110107142334.000|20110107142337.000|TR0|them, like -- like they used to go over to 
20110107142337.000|20110107142339.000|TR0|the house with me when I would do some 
20110107142339.000|20110107142341.000|TR0|work.  Now I can't even -- I can't even 
20110107142341.000|20110107142343.000|TR0|tell them, because then it'll just crush 
20110107142343.000|20110107142346.000|TR0|their dreams, like, how are you going to 
20110107142346.000|20110107142348.000|TR0|pull up to this place that your kids 
20110107142348.000|20110107142350.000|TR0|picked the colors out for the rooms?  I 
20110107142350.000|20110107142352.000|TR0|have visions of my daughters coming up 
20110107142352.000|20110107142355.000|TR0|from Kansas and playing in the backyard 
20110107142355.000|20110107142357.000|TR0|and -- now it's just gone.  Like, if I 
20110107142357.000|20110107142359.000|TR0|pull up to the house and be like -- 
20110107142359.000|20110107142401.000|TR0|they'll be like, "Where's the house?"
20110107142401.000|20110107142404.000|TR0|
20110107142404.000|20110107142406.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  So, where --
20110107142406.000|20110107142408.000|TR0|
20110107142408.000|20110107142410.000|TR0|HALL:  What do you want to tell them?
20110107142410.000|20110107142413.000|TR0|
20110107142413.000|20110107142415.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Where are you staying?  Where 
20110107142415.000|20110107142417.000|TR0|are you staying now?
20110107142417.000|20110107142419.000|TR0|
20110107142419.000|20110107142421.000|TR0|HALL:  I'm in a one-bedroom apartment.  I 
20110107142421.000|20110107142424.000|TR0|had plans to move into this house, I only 
20110107142424.000|20110107142426.000|TR0|had three more weeks and I'd have been in 
20110107142426.000|20110107142428.000|TR0|there. But now, when I pull up, I see a 
20110107142428.000|20110107142430.000|TR0|backhoe sitting on the house.  I had to 
20110107142430.000|20110107142433.000|TR0|drive around the block to make sure that I 
20110107142433.000|20110107142435.000|TR0|was on the right street. And I found out 
20110107142435.000|20110107142437.000|TR0|it was the right street.  It was just 
20110107142437.000|20110107142439.000|TR0|devastating.       PHILLIPS:  Well, we 
20110107142439.000|20110107142442.000|TR0|have tried to reach out to the contractor, 
20110107142442.000|20110107142444.000|TR0|PJ Deller.  No one's returning our calls.  
20110107142444.000|20110107142446.000|TR0|The mayor's office did tell the affiliate 
20110107142446.000|20110107142448.000|TR0|there, WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh, that PJ 
20110107142448.000|20110107142451.000|TR0|Deller won't be doing any more demolition 
20110107142451.000|20110107142453.000|TR0|work for the city.  Have you heard 
20110107142453.000|20110107142455.000|TR0|anything from the contractor?  Because 
20110107142455.000|20110107142457.000|TR0|they're not returning our calls, and they 
20110107142457.000|20110107142500.000|TR0|need to be called out on this.
20110107142500.000|20110107142502.000|TR0|
20110107142502.000|20110107142504.000|TR0|HALL:  I've not heard nothing from the 
20110107142504.000|20110107142506.000|TR0|contractor or the city. The city is 
20110107142506.000|20110107142508.000|TR0|copping out to, "Oh, they're not going to 
20110107142508.000|20110107142511.000|TR0|get any more business."  Yes, but they're 
20110107142511.000|20110107142513.000|TR0|not saying anything to me.  Now, the 
20110107142513.000|20110107142515.000|TR0|city's trying to say, "Oh, if he did work 
20110107142515.000|20110107142517.000|TR0|on the house, he didn't have a permit."  
20110107142517.000|20110107142520.000|TR0|You don't need a permit to do interior 
20110107142520.000|20110107142522.000|TR0|work, to paint, to mud and tape inside the 
20110107142522.000|20110107142524.000|TR0|house.  You need a permit to go outside 
20110107142524.000|20110107142526.000|TR0|and do exterior work.  All the work that 
20110107142526.000|20110107142529.000|TR0|they had listed that need to be done was 
20110107142529.000|20110107142531.000|TR0|exterior work.
20110107142531.000|20110107142533.000|TR0|
20110107142533.000|20110107142535.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  So, so the city's not helping 
20110107142535.000|20110107142538.000|TR0|you at all?  They're not giving you any 
20110107142538.000|20110107142540.000|TR0|options?  Because I see a letter, here.  
20110107142540.000|20110107142542.000|TR0|We've got a copy from the city of the 
20110107142542.000|20110107142544.000|TR0|Pittsburgh, the Department of Public 
20110107142544.000|20110107142547.000|TR0|Safety, the Bureau of Building Inspections 
20110107142547.000|20110107142549.000|TR0|saying, "Do not demolish" your home.  It's 
20110107142549.000|20110107142551.000|TR0|got your address on here, and it's telling 
20110107142551.000|20110107142553.000|TR0|the contractor not to demolish your home.  
20110107142553.000|20110107142555.000|TR0|So, are they doing anything to help you 
20110107142555.000|20110107142558.000|TR0|with what your options are now?
20110107142558.000|20110107142600.000|TR0|
20110107142600.000|20110107142602.000|TR0|HALL:  They're not doing anything.  If it 
20110107142602.000|20110107142604.000|TR0|was a Steeler game, they would do 
20110107142604.000|20110107142607.000|TR0|something.  But nobody's trying to help 
20110107142607.000|20110107142609.000|TR0|me.  Pittsburgh needs to stand up, because 
20110107142609.000|20110107142611.000|TR0|if they don't stand up, they're going to 
20110107142611.000|20110107142613.000|TR0|fall for anything, just let this keep 
20110107142613.000|20110107142616.000|TR0|happening.
20110107142616.000|20110107142618.000|TR0|
20110107142618.000|20110107142620.000|TR0|This is -- this is crazy, like -- this is 
20110107142620.000|20110107142622.000|TR0|just crazy.  My dream is done.  It's gone. 
20110107142622.000|20110107142625.000|TR0| And now, now they want to point fingers.  
20110107142625.000|20110107142627.000|TR0|"Oh, it wasn't me.  It was them.  It 
20110107142627.000|20110107142629.000|TR0|wasn't me, it was them."  That's crazy.  
20110107142629.000|20110107142631.000|TR0|And for him to come on TV, the head of 
20110107142631.000|20110107142634.000|TR0|Bureau Inspectors to come on TV and say, 
20110107142634.000|20110107142636.000|TR0|"Oh, he didn't have a permit, so why would 
20110107142636.000|20110107142638.000|TR0|he be doing work in the house?"  I bet he 
20110107142638.000|20110107142640.000|TR0|hasn't inspected the house in five years.
20110107142640.000|20110107142642.000|TR0|
20110107142642.000|20110107142645.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right, well, thanks --
20110107142645.000|20110107142647.000|TR0|
20110107142647.000|20110107142649.000|TR0|HALL:  Going to come and say I don't have 
20110107142649.000|20110107142651.000|TR0|a permit.
20110107142651.000|20110107142654.000|TR0|
20110107142654.000|20110107142656.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, we wanted to talk to you, 
20110107142656.000|20110107142658.000|TR0|we wanted to get the story out there, and 
20110107142658.000|20110107142700.000|TR0|we are asking PJ Deller, someone from that 
20110107142700.000|20110107142703.000|TR0|contracting incorporation to give us some 
20110107142703.000|20110107142705.000|TR0|type of answer of what's going to happen.  
20110107142705.000|20110107142707.000|TR0|Obviously, the wrong house was demolished.
20110107142707.000|20110107142709.000|TR0|
20110107142709.000|20110107142712.000|TR0|The City of Pittsburgh, we'd like to know 
20110107142712.000|20110107142714.000|TR0|if they're going to help you in any way in 
20110107142714.000|20110107142716.000|TR0|telling you your options.  Andre Hall, we 
20110107142716.000|20110107142718.000|TR0|sure hope that you stay in touch with us 
20110107142718.000|20110107142721.000|TR0|and let us know how this plays out.  We'd 
20110107142721.000|20110107142723.000|TR0|like to put the pressure on the right 
20110107142723.000|20110107142725.000|TR0|people.
20110107142725.000|20110107142727.000|TR0|
20110107142727.000|20110107142730.000|TR0|HALL:  Thank you.  Yes, they need the 
20110107142730.000|20110107142732.000|TR0|pressure put on them, because nobody said 
20110107142732.000|20110107142734.000|TR0|anything, nobody came by to see me, 
20110107142734.000|20110107142736.000|TR0|nothing.
20110107142736.000|20110107142738.000|TR0|
20110107142738.000|20110107142741.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Andre hall, you keep in --
20110107142741.000|20110107142743.000|TR0|
20110107142743.000|20110107142745.000|TR0|HALL:  I even --
20110107142745.000|20110107142747.000|TR0|
20110107142747.000|20110107142750.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Go ahead.
20110107142750.000|20110107142752.000|TR0|
20110107142752.000|20110107142754.000|TR0|HALL:  I even had my little nephew come 
20110107142754.000|20110107142756.000|TR0|down from Cal U to help me on the weekends 
20110107142756.000|20110107142759.000|TR0|on the house.  He would come down there.  
20110107142759.000|20110107142801.000|TR0|Very strong builder.  He would come down 
20110107142801.000|20110107142803.000|TR0|and just help me.
20110107142803.000|20110107142805.000|TR0|
20110107142805.000|20110107142808.000|TR0|And now, when he -- when we went over to 
20110107142808.000|20110107142810.000|TR0|the property, he's like, "Unc, where's the 
20110107142810.000|20110107142812.000|TR0|house?"  I'm like, "You don't even want to 
20110107142812.000|20110107142814.000|TR0|know."
20110107142814.000|20110107142817.000|TR0|
20110107142817.000|20110107142819.000|TR0|I don't even want to take him to the paint 
20110107142819.000|20110107142821.000|TR0|picture to show him that this backhoe 
20110107142821.000|20110107142823.000|TR0|knocked down my house.
20110107142823.000|20110107142825.000|TR0|
20110107142825.000|20110107142828.000|TR0|What do you tell your kids?  What do you 
20110107142828.000|20110107142830.000|TR0|tell your kids, like, "Oh, the room that 
20110107142830.000|20110107142832.000|TR0|you picked out, with the colors and 
20110107142832.000|20110107142834.000|TR0|everything, is gone.  You can't play in 
20110107142834.000|20110107142837.000|TR0|the backyard."  The house that they were 
20110107142837.000|20110107142839.000|TR0|supposed to knock down, that's -- I was 
20110107142839.000|20110107142841.000|TR0|going to take that lot over and add on.
20110107142841.000|20110107142843.000|TR0|
20110107142843.000|20110107142846.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  We'll, Andre, we will --
20110107142846.000|20110107142848.000|TR0|
20110107142848.000|20110107142850.000|TR0|HALL:  It's just --

20110107142928.000|20110107142930.000|TR0|He was a teacher's aide for special needs

20110107142948.000|20110107142951.000|TR0|is just heart- wrenching.  A teacher's 
20110107142951.000|20110107142953.000|TR0|aide for special needs students actually 
20110107142953.000|20110107142955.000|TR0|died this week trying to save an autistic 
20110107142955.000|20110107142957.000|TR0|teen from the path of a bus. Witnesses say 
20110107142957.000|20110107142959.000|TR0|that Thomas Jim Dunn actually pushed the 
20110107142959.000|20110107143002.000|TR0|child out of harm's way as the pair 
20110107143002.000|20110107143004.000|TR0|crossed an Illinois street during a soda 
20110107143004.000|20110107143006.000|TR0|run. It was a final selfless act for a man 
20110107143006.000|20110107143008.000|TR0|who is also a 20-year vet of the police 
20110107143008.000|20110107143011.000|TR0|auxiliary unit in Bourbonnais, just about

20110107143035.000|20110107143038.000|TR0|we're going to miss him.  So I mean, it's 
20110107143038.000|20110107143040.000|TR0|very, very hard.

20110107143100.000|20110107143102.000|TR0|were, he was the same with every student, 
20110107143102.000|20110107143104.000|TR0|every staff member.  He was a person who

20110107143109.000|20110107143111.000|TR0|HORNG:  On Monday afternoon, he was doing 
20110107143111.000|20110107143113.000|TR0|what he often did, teaching a student a 
20110107143113.000|20110107143116.000|TR0|life lesson by walking him across the 
20110107143116.000|20110107143118.000|TR0|street to buy a soda.  Police say a public 
20110107143118.000|20110107143120.000|TR0|transit bus hit Dunn as it was turning 
20110107143120.000|20110107143122.000|TR0|left, barely missing the student.  And 
20110107143122.000|20110107143125.000|TR0|investigators are now looking into initial 
20110107143125.000|20110107143127.000|TR0|witness statements that Dunn pushed the

20110107143133.000|20110107143136.000|TR0|POLICE DEPARTMENT: Knowing Jim, it would 
20110107143136.000|20110107143138.000|TR0|not be surprising had he done that.  If 
20110107143138.000|20110107143140.000|TR0|you know Jim at all, that would be an 
20110107143140.000|20110107143142.000|TR0|instinctive reaction that he would have.

20110107143145.000|20110107143147.000|TR0|PAT DUNN:  Doesn't surprise me at all, 
20110107143147.000|20110107143149.000|TR0|because that's the type of person he was.  
20110107143149.000|20110107143151.000|TR0|He'd always put himself out to protect 
20110107143151.000|20110107143154.000|TR0|somebody else. That's the kind of thing he 
20110107143154.000|20110107143156.000|TR0|did.

20110107143200.000|20110107143203.000|TR0|Dunn knew well.  He was a nearly 20-year 
20110107143203.000|20110107143205.000|TR0|veteran of the Bourbonnais police 
20110107143205.000|20110107143207.000|TR0|auxiliary unit, volunteering to help the

20110107143209.000|20110107143212.000|TR0|he was among the first responders during 
20110107143212.000|20110107143214.000|TR0|one of Bourbonnais' darkest hours, the 
20110107143214.000|20110107143216.000|TR0|fatal Amtrak crash in March of 1999.

20110107143241.000|20110107143243.000|TR0|it's determined that he pushed that child

20110107143314.000|20110107143316.000|TR0|market.  An hour ago, the government said 
20110107143316.000|20110107143319.000|TR0|that the economy added 103,000 jobs in 
20110107143319.000|20110107143321.000|TR0|December, and the unemployment rate

20110107143330.000|20110107143332.000|TR0|ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, 
20110107143332.000|20110107143334.000|TR0|Kyra.  We are expecting to see stocks open 
20110107143334.000|20110107143337.000|TR0|flat to slightly higher.  To tell you the 
20110107143337.000|20110107143339.000|TR0|truth, Wall Street wasn't overly impressed 
20110107143339.000|20110107143341.000|TR0|with this jobs report, because we watched 
20110107143341.000|20110107143343.000|TR0|futures bounce around quite a bit after 
20110107143343.000|20110107143346.000|TR0|this report was released.
20110107143346.000|20110107143348.000|TR0|
20110107143348.000|20110107143350.000|TR0|The headline number, you have to remember, 
20110107143350.000|20110107143352.000|TR0|was 103,000 jobs added to the economy in 
20110107143352.000|20110107143355.000|TR0|December.  It really was a bit of a 
20110107143355.000|20110107143357.000|TR0|disappointment. Wall Street was expecting 
20110107143357.000|20110107143359.000|TR0|to have 150,000 jobs added.
20110107143359.000|20110107143401.000|TR0|
20110107143401.000|20110107143403.000|TR0|But the good news, the October and 
20110107143403.000|20110107143406.000|TR0|November numbers, those were revised up to 
20110107143406.000|20110107143408.000|TR0|show 70,00 more jobs added than previously 
20110107143408.000|20110107143410.000|TR0|thought.
20110107143410.000|20110107143412.000|TR0|
20110107143412.000|20110107143415.000|TR0|Also, I want you to be careful a bit with 
20110107143415.000|20110107143417.000|TR0|the unemployment rate now.  It was a big 
20110107143417.000|20110107143419.000|TR0|decline, sure, from 9.8 percent to 9.4 
20110107143419.000|20110107143421.000|TR0|percent. But it was partly because people 
20110107143421.000|20110107143424.000|TR0|were literally dropping out of the 
20110107143424.000|20110107143426.000|TR0|workforce.  They were giving up looking 
20110107143426.000|20110107143428.000|TR0|for work.  So, the drop in the 
20110107143428.000|20110107143430.000|TR0|unemployment rate doesn't necessarily mean 
20110107143430.000|20110107143433.000|TR0|people have found jobs.
20110107143433.000|20110107143435.000|TR0|
20110107143435.000|20110107143437.000|TR0|All right.  There's another big story

20110107143439.000|20110107143442.000|TR0|chairman Ben Bernanke testifying on 
20110107143442.000|20110107143444.000|TR0|Capitol Hill today, he'll likely address 
20110107143444.000|20110107143446.000|TR0|these jobs numbers, as well.  And more 
20110107143446.000|20110107143448.000|TR0|good news, here, stocks are still going to 
20110107143448.000|20110107143450.000|TR0|most likely post gains for the week.
20110107143450.000|20110107143453.000|TR0|
20110107143453.000|20110107143455.000|TR0|All right, Kyra.  This one is for you.  
20110107143455.000|20110107143457.000|TR0|You may be able to buy a piece of 
20110107143457.000|20110107143459.000|TR0|Facebook.  The (INAUDIBLE) reports that 
20110107143459.000|20110107143502.000|TR0|the company could go public by early 2012 
20110107143502.000|20110107143504.000|TR0|or it may start to disclose some financial 
20110107143504.000|20110107143506.000|TR0|information even without going public.  
20110107143506.000|20110107143508.000|TR0|You know, this is required by law because 
20110107143508.000|20110107143511.000|TR0|an increase in the number of private 
20110107143511.000|20110107143513.000|TR0|investors in Facebook that have come to 
20110107143513.000|20110107143515.000|TR0|light of late.
20110107143515.000|20110107143517.000|TR0|
20110107143517.000|20110107143520.000|TR0|The company now is valued at about $50 
20110107143520.000|20110107143522.000|TR0|billion.  That compares to what it was 
20110107143522.000|20110107143524.000|TR0|valued at three years ago, somewhere along 
20110107143524.000|20110107143526.000|TR0|the lines of $15 billion.  So Kyra, even 
20110107143526.000|20110107143529.000|TR0|though you may not be on Facebook, you may 
20110107143529.000|20110107143531.000|TR0|want to put your money into it and invest.

20110107143609.000|20110107143611.000|TR0|of the National Economic Council.  
20110107143611.000|20110107143613.000|TR0|Sperling held the key policy post at the

20110107143638.000|20110107143640.000|TR0|and Jamie Scott on one condition:  Gladys

20110107143642.000|20110107143645.000|TR0|ill sister.       Now, remember all that

20110107143647.000|20110107143649.000|TR0|care debate?  One lawmaker says they're a 
20110107143649.000|20110107143651.000|TR0|reality in his state.  He's talking about 
20110107143651.000|20110107143654.000|TR0|budget cuts that have denied nearly 100 
20110107143654.000|20110107143656.000|TR0|people potentially lifesaving transplants. 
20110107143656.000|20110107143658.000|TR0| Two people have already been denied and

20110107143709.000|20110107143711.000|TR0|need potentially lifesaving transplants, 
20110107143711.000|20110107143714.000|TR0|but they can't get them.  Not in their 
20110107143714.000|20110107143716.000|TR0|state anyway.  Why?  Tough times.  
20110107143716.000|20110107143718.000|TR0|Politics and some say misplaced

20110107143732.000|20110107143734.000|TR0|(voice-over): Nearly 100 lives hang in the 
20110107143734.000|20110107143736.000|TR0|balance, pleading with Arizona leaders to 
20110107143736.000|20110107143738.000|TR0|come up with $1.5 million in funding.  A 
20110107143738.000|20110107143741.000|TR0|tiny fraction of the budget.  For people 
20110107143741.000|20110107143743.000|TR0|like Lois Tate's who's 27 year-old 
20110107143743.000|20110107143745.000|TR0|daughter needs new lungs, the funding is 
20110107143745.000|20110107143747.000|TR0|priceless.

20110107143750.000|20110107143752.000|TR0|LOIS TATE, DAUGHTER NEEDS NEW LUNGS: Her 
20110107143752.000|20110107143754.000|TR0|quality of life is slowly dwindling away 
20110107143754.000|20110107143756.000|TR0|and her only hope to live longer was to 
20110107143756.000|20110107143758.000|TR0|get a transplant, and that has been taken 
20110107143758.000|20110107143801.000|TR0|away from her
20110107143801.000|20110107143803.000|TR0|
20110107143803.000|20110107143805.000|TR0|CHAPIN: She's one of several who sent a

20110107143812.000|20110107143814.000|TR0|for the last month, e-mail and phone calls 
20110107143814.000|20110107143816.000|TR0|have gone unnoticed.

20110107143825.000|20110107143828.000|TR0|TATE (via phone):  Well, what we want -- 
20110107143828.000|20110107143830.000|TR0|we want to say to them is that take 
20110107143830.000|20110107143832.000|TR0|another look at different areas where we 
20110107143832.000|20110107143834.000|TR0|can come up with the money to restore this 
20110107143834.000|20110107143837.000|TR0|-- these transplants.
20110107143837.000|20110107143839.000|TR0|
20110107143839.000|20110107143841.000|TR0|CHAPIN (voice-over): Since she couldn't 
20110107143841.000|20110107143843.000|TR0|get an answer so we tried the governor's 
20110107143843.000|20110107143846.000|TR0|office ourselves.

20110107143857.000|20110107143859.000|TR0|CHAPIN: Three calls, one e-mail and no 
20110107143859.000|20110107143901.000|TR0|response.  So, we took her concerns to 
20110107143901.000|20110107143903.000|TR0|state senator Frank Antenori .

20110107143906.000|20110107143908.000|TR0|(on camera):  Is the state doing anything 
20110107143908.000|20110107143910.000|TR0|now to restore the funding?
20110107143910.000|20110107143912.000|TR0|
20110107143912.000|20110107143915.000|TR0|FRANK ANTENORI, ARIZONA STATE SENATOR:  
20110107143915.000|20110107143917.000|TR0|No, again, the funding reduction occurred 
20110107143917.000|20110107143919.000|TR0|because data showed that the outcome from 
20110107143919.000|20110107143921.000|TR0|providing funding for these patients was 
20110107143921.000|20110107143924.000|TR0|negligible.
20110107143924.000|20110107143926.000|TR0|
20110107143926.000|20110107143928.000|TR0|CHAPIN (voice-over): He says even if 
20110107143928.000|20110107143930.000|TR0|dollars were available, the risky 
20110107143930.000|20110107143933.000|TR0|procedures wouldn't be worth taking money 
20110107143933.000|20110107143935.000|TR0|from other programs.
20110107143935.000|20110107143937.000|TR0|
20110107143937.000|20110107143939.000|TR0|But no action leaves 96 patients like Tate

20110107143941.000|20110107143944.000|TR0|lives.

20110107143946.000|20110107143948.000|TR0|(on camera):  What do you have to say to

20110107143950.000|20110107143953.000|TR0|
20110107143953.000|20110107143955.000|TR0|ANTENORI:  Well, again, I wish we had the 
20110107143955.000|20110107143957.000|TR0|money and it was flowing from the hills of 
20110107143957.000|20110107143959.000|TR0|Arizona to fund everything we wanted to 
20110107143959.000|20110107144002.000|TR0|fund.  But tough decisions are made 
20110107144002.000|20110107144004.000|TR0|because we're in a budget crisis right now.

20110107144622.000|20110107144624.000|TR0|that he's approval rating at 37 percent 
20110107144624.000|20110107144627.000|TR0|and the reason being is the mishandling of 
20110107144627.000|20110107144629.000|TR0|that recent snowstorm up in New York that 
20110107144629.000|20110107144631.000|TR0|really just paralyzed Manhattan.
20110107144631.000|20110107144633.000|TR0|
20110107144633.000|20110107144636.000|TR0|Now, Michael Bloomberg just a few months 
20110107144636.000|20110107144638.000|TR0|earlier was at 50 percent in a Merit's 
20110107144638.000|20110107144640.000|TR0|poll and you've got to wonder Kyra, is he 
20110107144640.000|20110107144642.000|TR0|hoping for some warmer weather -- Kyra.
20110107144642.000|20110107144645.000|TR0|
20110107144645.000|20110107144647.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And two Republicans 
20110107144647.000|20110107144649.000|TR0|participated in a House vote but they had 
20110107144649.000|20110107144651.000|TR0|not yet been sworn?
20110107144651.000|20110107144653.000|TR0|
20110107144653.000|20110107144656.000|TR0|PRESTON:  No.  They hadn't been sworn in 
20110107144656.000|20110107144658.000|TR0|and -- and talk about a big embarrassment. 
20110107144658.000|20110107144700.000|TR0| Two Congressmen, Pete Sessions from Texas 
20110107144700.000|20110107144702.000|TR0|and Mike Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania 
20110107144702.000|20110107144705.000|TR0|were at a reception for some constituents 
20110107144705.000|20110107144707.000|TR0|of Fitzpatrick.  Now, everybody else is on 
20110107144707.000|20110107144709.000|TR0|the House floor and getting sworn in.  
20110107144709.000|20110107144711.000|TR0|They happen to be at this reception and 
20110107144711.000|20110107144714.000|TR0|when it showed up on the TV they raised 
20110107144714.000|20110107144716.000|TR0|their hands and they took the oath 
20110107144716.000|20110107144718.000|TR0|virtually.
20110107144718.000|20110107144720.000|TR0|
20110107144720.000|20110107144723.000|TR0|But guess what, you can't do it that way, 
20110107144723.000|20110107144725.000|TR0|the House rules require that you have to 
20110107144725.000|20110107144727.000|TR0|be on the House floor to take the oath.  
20110107144727.000|20110107144729.000|TR0|Now, they had voted which caused a little 
20110107144729.000|20110107144732.000|TR0|bit of concern and a little frustration 
20110107144732.000|20110107144734.000|TR0|from House Republicans.  And in fact, 
20110107144734.000|20110107144736.000|TR0|there was a committee meeting that had to 
20110107144736.000|20110107144738.000|TR0|be postponed, a very important committee 
20110107144738.000|20110107144740.000|TR0|meeting regarding Republicans' efforts to 
20110107144740.000|20110107144743.000|TR0|repeal health care that had to be 
20110107144743.000|20110107144745.000|TR0|postponed until they got these congressmen 
20110107144745.000|20110107144747.000|TR0|sworn in.     So, a little bit of an 
20110107144747.000|20110107144749.000|TR0|embarrassment for the House Republicans in 
20110107144749.000|20110107144752.000|TR0|the first couple of days of Congress -- 
20110107144752.000|20110107144754.000|TR0|Kyra.
20110107144754.000|20110107144756.000|TR0|
20110107144756.000|20110107144758.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  It's going to be an interesting 
20110107144758.000|20110107144801.000|TR0|year.  Wouldn't you say, Mark?
20110107144801.000|20110107144803.000|TR0|
20110107144803.000|20110107144805.000|TR0|PRESTON:  Absolutely, bring on Snooki, it 
20110107144805.000|20110107144807.000|TR0|will even be more interesting.
20110107144807.000|20110107144810.000|TR0|
20110107144810.000|20110107144812.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, exactly.
20110107144812.000|20110107144814.000|TR0|
20110107144814.000|20110107144816.000|TR0|All right.  We're going to have your next

20110107144827.000|20110107144830.000|TR0|A couple's chance to have their baby in a 
20110107144830.000|20110107144832.000|TR0|movie turns into a pretty big nightmare.  
20110107144832.000|20110107144834.000|TR0|Police say the baby was actually snatched 
20110107144834.000|20110107144836.000|TR0|during this phony audition.
20110107144836.000|20110107144839.000|TR0|
20110107144839.000|20110107144841.000|TR0|But first, "Flashback", January 7th, 1927. 
20110107144841.000|20110107144843.000|TR0| Now, think basketball and Harlem 
20110107144843.000|20110107144845.000|TR0|Globetrotters.  Yes, the iconic team 
20110107144845.000|20110107144848.000|TR0|played its first ever road game in the 
20110107144848.000|20110107144850.000|TR0|town of Hinckley, Illinois.  Over the 
20110107144850.000|20110107144852.000|TR0|years, the team featured you know, Curly 
20110107144852.000|20110107144854.000|TR0|Neil, Meadowlark Lemon, remember those 
20110107144854.000|20110107144857.000|TR0|guys? They entertained audiences in 120 
20110107144857.000|20110107144859.000|TR0|countries and territories across six 
20110107144859.000|20110107144901.000|TR0|continents.

20110107144906.000|20110107144908.000|TR0|
20110107144908.000|20110107144910.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, scanning our "Morning 
20110107144910.000|20110107144912.000|TR0|Passport".  In London, there are reports 
20110107144912.000|20110107144915.000|TR0|of beefed up security after intelligence 
20110107144915.000|20110107144917.000|TR0|suggests terrorists could be planning 
20110107144917.000|20110107144919.000|TR0|attacks but authorities are pretty tight- 
20110107144919.000|20110107144921.000|TR0|lipped about it right now.
20110107144921.000|20110107144923.000|TR0|
20110107144923.000|20110107144926.000|TR0|Zain Verjee, following all of this for us 
20110107144926.000|20110107144928.000|TR0|from London.  So Zain, what can you tell 
20110107144928.000|20110107144930.000|TR0|us?
20110107144930.000|20110107144932.000|TR0|
20110107144932.000|20110107144935.000|TR0|ZAIN VERJEE, CNN INTERNATIONAL 
20110107144935.000|20110107144937.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're not getting 
20110107144937.000|20110107144939.000|TR0|too much information or details, but what 
20110107144939.000|20110107144941.000|TR0|we can tell you, Kyra, according to a 
20110107144941.000|20110107144944.000|TR0|security source, that there are plans 
20110107144944.000|20110107144946.000|TR0|possibly in the works to attack places 
20110107144946.000|20110107144948.000|TR0|like train stations, subway stations here 
20110107144948.000|20110107144950.000|TR0|in England, in London and greater London 
20110107144950.000|20110107144953.000|TR0|as well; as well as possibly aviation 
20110107144953.000|20110107144955.000|TR0|centers, too.
20110107144955.000|20110107144957.000|TR0|
20110107144957.000|20110107144959.000|TR0|So yes, security's been totally beefed up. 
20110107144959.000|20110107145002.000|TR0| You can see police at different tube 
20110107145002.000|20110107145004.000|TR0|stations as well as Heathrow airports as 
20110107145004.000|20110107145006.000|TR0|well.  The threat level was raised from 
20110107145006.000|20110107145008.000|TR0|substantial to severe for both aviation as 
20110107145008.000|20110107145010.000|TR0|well as London transport.
20110107145010.000|20110107145013.000|TR0|
20110107145013.000|20110107145015.000|TR0|What -- what one source said us was that 
20110107145015.000|20110107145017.000|TR0|there was a possibility that there could 
20110107145017.000|20110107145019.000|TR0|be some kind of a Mumbai-style terror 
20110107145019.000|20110107145022.000|TR0|attack, so everyone is a little bit 
20110107145022.000|20110107145024.000|TR0|nervous, being asked to be vigilant and 
20110107145024.000|20110107145026.000|TR0|careful.  But what this official told us 
20110107145026.000|20110107145028.000|TR0|was that there is no expectation of an 
20110107145028.000|20110107145031.000|TR0|imminent attack, but this was mainly 
20110107145031.000|20110107145033.000|TR0|precautionary -- Kyra.
20110107145033.000|20110107145035.000|TR0|
20110107145035.000|20110107145037.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Got it.     All right, let -- 
20110107145037.000|20110107145040.000|TR0|let's turn to Germany.  Thousands of 
20110107145040.000|20110107145042.000|TR0|poultry and pig farms quarantined 
20110107145042.000|20110107145044.000|TR0|apparently.  What's going on?
20110107145044.000|20110107145046.000|TR0|
20110107145046.000|20110107145049.000|TR0|VERJEE:  Yes, this is such a huge scandal, 
20110107145049.000|20110107145051.000|TR0|Kyra.  It's a tainted egg scandal.  
20110107145051.000|20110107145053.000|TR0|Basically thousands of farms as you said, 
20110107145053.000|20110107145055.000|TR0|in Germany that they're shutting down 
20110107145055.000|20110107145057.000|TR0|because there was a situation where animal 
20110107145057.000|20110107145100.000|TR0|feed that they were receiving was 
20110107145100.000|20110107145102.000|TR0|contaminated.
20110107145102.000|20110107145104.000|TR0|
20110107145104.000|20110107145106.000|TR0|The company is called Harlis and Yinch and 
20110107145106.000|20110107145109.000|TR0|apparently, Kyra, they knew for months 
20110107145109.000|20110107145111.000|TR0|that they were sending fatty acids that 
20110107145111.000|20110107145113.000|TR0|were basically contaminated with dioxins.  
20110107145113.000|20110107145115.000|TR0|Because you see they have a specific level 
20110107145115.000|20110107145118.000|TR0|of dioxin that you can't really go above.  
20110107145118.000|20110107145120.000|TR0|And they were aware of it and yet they 
20110107145120.000|20110107145122.000|TR0|shipped all -- all the animal -- well, the 
20110107145122.000|20110107145124.000|TR0|fatty acids out to the farms and have 
20110107145124.000|20110107145127.000|TR0|created the situation of contamination.
20110107145127.000|20110107145129.000|TR0|
20110107145129.000|20110107145131.000|TR0|So, all these places in quarantine now and 
20110107145131.000|20110107145133.000|TR0|criminal charges are going to be filed 
20110107145133.000|20110107145136.000|TR0|against this company.
20110107145136.000|20110107145138.000|TR0|
20110107145138.000|20110107145140.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right, let's head to 
20110107145140.000|20110107145142.000|TR0|Canada.  This was a story that that struck 
20110107145142.000|20110107145144.000|TR0|us all this morning.  This New York woman 
20110107145144.000|20110107145147.000|TR0|is actually accused of faking a movie 
20110107145147.000|20110107145149.000|TR0|casting call because she wanted to kidnap 
20110107145149.000|20110107145151.000|TR0|a baby.
20110107145151.000|20110107145153.000|TR0|
20110107145153.000|20110107145156.000|TR0|VERJEE:  Yes, she is in jail, Kyra, 
20110107145156.000|20110107145158.000|TR0|because she came up with this whole 
20110107145158.000|20110107145200.000|TR0|elaborate way of stealing a baby.  And she 
20110107145200.000|20110107145202.000|TR0|put out this casting call for babies and 
20110107145202.000|20110107145205.000|TR0|what she said was a Hollywood -- I'm 
20110107145205.000|20110107145207.000|TR0|sorry, a Bollywood movie production.  And 
20110107145207.000|20110107145209.000|TR0|these parents came with their kids.

20110107145211.000|20110107145214.000|TR0|And what happened was she asked one set of

20110107145216.000|20110107145218.000|TR0|another room and they said, ok, and when 
20110107145218.000|20110107145220.000|TR0|she did that, she just took off.
20110107145220.000|20110107145223.000|TR0|
20110107145223.000|20110107145225.000|TR0|And police did track down the baby.  The 
20110107145225.000|20110107145227.000|TR0|baby is ok, but I want you to listen to 
20110107145227.000|20110107145229.000|TR0|what other parents who were asked to do

20110107145606.000|20110107145609.000|TR0|So what do you do?
20110107145609.000|20110107145611.000|TR0|
20110107145611.000|20110107145613.000|TR0|Austin Groff from Twin Valley South High

20110107145615.000|20110107145618.000|TR0|incredible shot.  Just heave it.  It's 
20110107145618.000|20110107145620.000|TR0|good.
20110107145620.000|20110107145622.000|TR0|
20110107145622.000|20110107145624.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And it was a swish.

20110107145635.000|20110107145638.000|TR0|FISCHEL:  The end of the quarter, he knows 
20110107145638.000|20110107145640.000|TR0|time's running out, so just why not?  
20110107145640.000|20110107145642.000|TR0|Right?  Unbelievable.  Watch one guy jump 
20110107145642.000|20110107145644.000|TR0|off the bench like as if the team has just 
20110107145644.000|20110107145647.000|TR0|like won the entire game.  This is just 
20110107145647.000|20110107145649.000|TR0|the end of the first quarter.  
20110107145649.000|20110107145651.000|TR0|Unfortunately, Groff's team would lose, 
20110107145651.000|20110107145653.000|TR0|but that is truly the shot of the early 
20110107145653.000|20110107145656.000|TR0|year.
20110107145656.000|20110107145658.000|TR0|
20110107145658.000|20110107145700.000|TR0|Talk about luck.  How about Andrew Luck?  
20110107145700.000|20110107145702.000|TR0|The Stanford quarter back was a sure bet 
20110107145702.000|20110107145705.000|TR0|to be the number one pick in the NFL draft 
20110107145705.000|20110107145707.000|TR0|if he decided to leave college early.  But

20110107145716.000|20110107145718.000|TR0|FISCHEL:  He wants to graduate.  He 
20110107145718.000|20110107145720.000|TR0|doesn't want to turn pro yet.  He says one 
20110107145720.000|20110107145722.000|TR0|more year and he can get his degree in 
20110107145722.000|20110107145725.000|TR0|architectural design, so he's putting it 
20110107145725.000|20110107145727.000|TR0|all off including the millions of dollars 
20110107145727.000|20110107145729.000|TR0|to come back to Stanford for his senior 
20110107145729.000|20110107145731.000|TR0|season.
20110107145731.000|20110107145734.000|TR0|

20110107145745.000|20110107145747.000|TR0|the Auburn Tigers.
20110107145747.000|20110107145749.000|TR0|
20110107145749.000|20110107145752.000|TR0|How confident?  He's posted on Craigslist 
20110107145752.000|20110107145754.000|TR0|this ad. It says Oregon fan seeks Auburn 
20110107145754.000|20110107145756.000|TR0|hottie for short-term Vegas marriage.  His 
20110107145756.000|20110107145758.000|TR0|idea, he'll meet the woman in Vegas, 
20110107145758.000|20110107145801.000|TR0|they'll get married.  And whoever loses 
20110107145801.000|20110107145803.000|TR0|the game has to pay for the annulment.
20110107145803.000|20110107145805.000|TR0|
20110107145805.000|20110107145807.000|TR0|So, he wants to complete -- that's what 
20110107145807.000|20110107145809.000|TR0|you get for waking up in Vegas adventure, 
20110107145809.000|20110107145812.000|TR0|but doesn't want to wake up asking, do I 
20110107145812.000|20110107145814.000|TR0|know you and what did I do?
20110107145814.000|20110107145816.000|TR0|
20110107145816.000|20110107145818.000|TR0|All right.  You have to this though, Maple 
20110107145818.000|20110107145821.000|TR0|Leaf's Michael Grabovski -- he's a new 
20110107145821.000|20110107145823.000|TR0|dad.  His daughter just born last week and 
20110107145823.000|20110107145825.000|TR0|he's showing off for the girl.
20110107145825.000|20110107145827.000|TR0|
20110107145827.000|20110107145830.000|TR0|The spin-o-rama that puts it over for the 
20110107145830.000|20110107145832.000|TR0|gold, that wasn't a shootout.  Helped the 
20110107145832.000|20110107145834.000|TR0|Maple Leafs beat the Blues.
20110107145834.000|20110107145836.000|TR0|
20110107145836.000|20110107145839.000|TR0|You're looking at the fastest golfer in 
20110107145839.000|20110107145841.000|TR0|the world.  Check out this guy.  He 
20110107145841.000|20110107145843.000|TR0|doesn't stop.  David Ogron, he holds five 
20110107145843.000|20110107145845.000|TR0|Guinness World records.  He will tell you, 
20110107145845.000|20110107145848.000|TR0|the record's not just his.  He owes a lot 
20110107145848.000|20110107145850.000|TR0|of credit to his holder, Scott McKinney.
20110107145850.000|20110107145852.000|TR0|
20110107145852.000|20110107145854.000|TR0|Look at him down there.  Scottie's 
20110107145854.000|20110107145856.000|TR0|nickname, of course, as you guessed is 
20110107145856.000|20110107145859.000|TR0|Speedy.  And tonight they go for another 
20110107145859.000|20110107145901.000|TR0|world record, 50 shots in 30 seconds.  I 
20110107145901.000|20110107145903.000|TR0|think they can pull that off based on what 
20110107145903.000|20110107145905.000|TR0|I've just seen.
20110107145905.000|20110107145908.000|TR0|
20110107145908.000|20110107145910.000|TR0|I wonder if the guy who puts down the 
20110107145910.000|20110107145912.000|TR0|balls has gotten whacked? I love it.
20110107145912.000|20110107145914.000|TR0|
20110107145914.000|20110107145917.000|TR0|FISCHEL:  That is -- seriously David's 
20110107145917.000|20110107145919.000|TR0|work right there.
20110107145919.000|20110107145921.000|TR0|
20110107145921.000|20110107145923.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110107145923.000|20110107145926.000|TR0|
20110107145926.000|20110107145928.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  I love it.
20110107145928.000|20110107145930.000|TR0|
20110107145930.000|20110107145932.000|TR0|FISCHEL:  You need time to (INAUDIBLE).
20110107145932.000|20110107145935.000|TR0|
20110107145935.000|20110107145937.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Thanks, Jeff.
20110107145937.000|20110107145939.000|TR0|
20110107145939.000|20110107145941.000|TR0|FISCHEL:  All right, Kyra.
