20110107130016.000|20110107130018.000|TR0|T.J. HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR:  Hey there, 
20110107130018.000|20110107130020.000|TR0|everybody.  Top of the hour here on this 
20110107130020.000|20110107130023.000|TR0|AMERICAN MORNING.  Glad you could be here 
20110107130023.000|20110107130025.000|TR0|with us. It's Friday, January the 7th.  
20110107130025.000|20110107130027.000|TR0|I'm T.J. Holmes.

20110107130030.000|20110107130032.000|TR0|KIRAN CHETRY, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm Kiran 
20110107130032.000|20110107130034.000|TR0|Chetry.  Thanks for joining us.
20110107130034.000|20110107130037.000|TR0|
20110107130037.000|20110107130039.000|TR0|A lot to talk about this morning, we'll 
20110107130039.000|20110107130041.000|TR0|get right to it.
20110107130041.000|20110107130043.000|TR0|
20110107130043.000|20110107130046.000|TR0|If you're headed to work right now or 
20110107130046.000|20110107130048.000|TR0|maybe just hoping for some work, we have 
20110107130048.000|20110107130050.000|TR0|the latest jobs report out this morning.  
20110107130050.000|20110107130053.000|TR0|What will the numbers be like?  Hopefully, 
20110107130053.000|20110107130055.000|TR0|moving in the right direction.  And also, 
20110107130055.000|20110107130057.000|TR0|what does it tell us about the economy 
20110107130057.000|20110107130100.000|TR0|moving forward?  We're standing by to 
20110107130100.000|20110107130102.000|TR0|break it down for you.
20110107130102.000|20110107130104.000|TR0|
20110107130104.000|20110107130107.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Also standing by to see two 
20110107130107.000|20110107130109.000|TR0|sisters walk out of a Mississippi prison.  
20110107130109.000|20110107130111.000|TR0|This could happen within the hour.  The 
20110107130111.000|20110107130113.000|TR0|release is conditional, however.  The 
20110107130113.000|20110107130116.000|TR0|condition is that one sister must donate a 
20110107130116.000|20110107130118.000|TR0|kidney to the other.  The governor has let 
20110107130118.000|20110107130120.000|TR0|them out on humanitarian reasons; also, 
20110107130120.000|20110107130123.000|TR0|for some financial reasons.
20110107130123.000|20110107130125.000|TR0|
20110107130125.000|20110107130127.000|TR0|We'll get into that and why some say they 
20110107130127.000|20110107130130.000|TR0|shouldn't have been in prison for 16 years 
20110107130130.000|20110107130132.000|TR0|in the first place.
20110107130132.000|20110107130134.000|TR0|
20110107130134.000|20110107130137.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Also, Mother Nature piling on.  
20110107130137.000|20110107130139.000|TR0|Another snowstorm is bearing down on the 
20110107130139.000|20110107130141.000|TR0|northeast.  Up to six inches could fall by 
20110107130141.000|20110107130143.000|TR0|this afternoon.  There's the tower camera 
20110107130143.000|20110107130146.000|TR0|of New York City.  A look outside right 
20110107130146.000|20110107130148.000|TR0|now, where you can se there's still some 
20110107130148.000|20110107130150.000|TR0|snow on the roofs from last time.
20110107130150.000|20110107130153.000|TR0|
20110107130153.000|20110107130155.000|TR0|In Philadelphia, as well, is already 
20110107130155.000|20110107130157.000|TR0|starting to come down. And after a big 
20110107130157.000|20110107130200.000|TR0|Christmas weekend blizzard debacle, 
20110107130200.000|20110107130202.000|TR0|everyone's wondering this morning: is New 
20110107130202.000|20110107130204.000|TR0|York ready to handle, albeit smaller, but 
20110107130204.000|20110107130207.000|TR0|another snowstorm?
20110107130207.000|20110107130209.000|TR0|
20110107130209.000|20110107130211.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right.  But it's one of the 
20110107130211.000|20110107130214.000|TR0|big things we're talking about today 
20110107130214.000|20110107130216.000|TR0|because we will know more about our 
20110107130216.000|20110107130218.000|TR0|economy here shortly.  Economic recovery 
20110107130218.000|20110107130220.000|TR0|-- is it happening?  Jobs, are they being 
20110107130220.000|20110107130223.000|TR0|created?
20110107130223.000|20110107130225.000|TR0|
20110107130225.000|20110107130227.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes, it's a big question.  And 
20110107130227.000|20110107130230.000|TR0|right now, in about 30 minutes, we're 
20110107130230.000|20110107130232.000|TR0|getting this latest jobs report.
20110107130232.000|20110107130234.000|TR0|
20110107130234.000|20110107130237.000|TR0|Christine Romans is "Minding Your 
20110107130237.000|20110107130239.000|TR0|Business" and she joins us now.
20110107130239.000|20110107130241.000|TR0|
20110107130241.000|20110107130244.000|TR0|And the news you that brought us, I think 
20110107130244.000|20110107130246.000|TR0|it was a day or two ago about the company 
20110107130246.000|20110107130248.000|TR0|that analyzes the payroll, saying they've 
20110107130248.000|20110107130250.000|TR0|seen month-to-month, a big jump.
20110107130250.000|20110107130253.000|TR0|
20110107130253.000|20110107130255.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUISNESS 
20110107130255.000|20110107130257.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  A big jump.  So, now, 
20110107130257.000|20110107130300.000|TR0|people are wondering today if we're going 
20110107130300.000|20110107130302.000|TR0|to see some blockbuster hiring in the 
20110107130302.000|20110107130304.000|TR0|month of December.  How much of it is 
20110107130304.000|20110107130307.000|TR0|seasonal, how much is companies hiring 
20110107130307.000|20110107130309.000|TR0|permanent workers?  We don't know yet.  
20110107130309.000|20110107130311.000|TR0|We'll know in 28 minutes.
20110107130311.000|20110107130314.000|TR0|
20110107130314.000|20110107130316.000|TR0|This is what the year look like though.  
20110107130316.000|20110107130318.000|TR0|2010 is a year that did see some job 
20110107130318.000|20110107130320.000|TR0|creation.  Those green bars are months 
20110107130320.000|20110107130323.000|TR0|when you saw thousands, hundreds of 
20110107130323.000|20110107130325.000|TR0|thousands of jobs created in some cases.  
20110107130325.000|20110107130327.000|TR0|Red, though, when we slipped back.  In 
20110107130327.000|20110107130330.000|TR0|November, only 39,000 jobs created. That 
20110107130330.000|20110107130332.000|TR0|was a disappointment.
20110107130332.000|20110107130334.000|TR0|
20110107130334.000|20110107130337.000|TR0|Now, on the right there, that hash mark 
20110107130337.000|20110107130339.000|TR0|bar, that's maybe 140,000, 150,000 jobs 
20110107130339.000|20110107130341.000|TR0|created.  We just don't know.  I'm going 
20110107130341.000|20110107130344.000|TR0|to be really honest with you.
20110107130344.000|20110107130346.000|TR0|
20110107130346.000|20110107130348.000|TR0|The labor market is big.  It's dynamic.  
20110107130348.000|20110107130350.000|TR0|It's under incredible stress.
20110107130350.000|20110107130353.000|TR0|
20110107130353.000|20110107130355.000|TR0|And we're just trying to get a good read 
20110107130355.000|20110107130357.000|TR0|of what's happening there.  We know that 
20110107130357.000|20110107130400.000|TR0|other signs of stability in the labor 
20110107130400.000|20110107130402.000|TR0|market have been coming in, you guys.  We 
20110107130402.000|20110107130404.000|TR0|want to see if the jobs are created. We'll 
20110107130404.000|20110107130407.000|TR0|know in about -- in about 28 minutes.
20110107130407.000|20110107130409.000|TR0|
20110107130409.000|20110107130411.000|TR0|I do know you still have 6 million people 
20110107130411.000|20110107130414.000|TR0|who have been jobless for six months or 
20110107130414.000|20110107130416.000|TR0|longer.  Very closely watching to see what 
20110107130416.000|20110107130418.000|TR0|the number is in this report.
20110107130418.000|20110107130421.000|TR0|
20110107130421.000|20110107130423.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right.  Christine, thank you.
20110107130423.000|20110107130425.000|TR0|
20110107130425.000|20110107130427.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Thanks, Christine.  We'll check 
20110107130427.000|20110107130430.000|TR0|in with you again.
20110107130430.000|20110107130432.000|TR0|
20110107130432.000|20110107130434.000|TR0|Also, stay with AMERICAN MORNING this 
20110107130434.000|20110107130437.000|TR0|morning and, of course, CNN throughout the 
20110107130437.000|20110107130439.000|TR0|day.  At 11:35 Eastern, President Obama is 
20110107130439.000|20110107130441.000|TR0|expected to speak about the new job 
20110107130441.000|20110107130444.000|TR0|numbers and broader economy and we'll 
20110107130444.000|20110107130446.000|TR0|bring it to you live when it happens.
20110107130446.000|20110107130448.000|TR0|
20110107130448.000|20110107130451.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, getting the economy back on 
20110107130451.000|20110107130453.000|TR0|track -- that is a big deal, big task for 
20110107130453.000|20110107130455.000|TR0|the president, top priority right now.  
20110107130455.000|20110107130457.000|TR0|Then moving into the second half of his 
20110107130457.000|20110107130500.000|TR0|first term now, he'll be counting on Gene 
20110107130500.000|20110107130502.000|TR0|Sperling, his newly-minted economic team 
20110107130502.000|20110107130504.000|TR0|trying to make this happen.
20110107130504.000|20110107130507.000|TR0|
20110107130507.000|20110107130509.000|TR0|Joining us from Washington to talk about

20110107130532.000|20110107130534.000|TR0|HOLMES:  This morning, we're going to hear 
20110107130534.000|20110107130537.000|TR0|the president talk about this in a bit.  
20110107130537.000|20110107130539.000|TR0|But, are we starting to get into 
20110107130539.000|20110107130541.000|TR0|re-election mode?  And everything that 
20110107130541.000|20110107130544.000|TR0|happens, every number that comes out and 
20110107130544.000|20110107130546.000|TR0|almost every move that's made, people are 
20110107130546.000|20110107130548.000|TR0|thinking ahead, like the president, that 
20110107130548.000|20110107130551.000|TR0|was going to happen in November of next 
20110107130551.000|20110107130553.000|TR0|year.
20110107130553.000|20110107130555.000|TR0|
20110107130555.000|20110107130558.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  You know, even if you -- we 
20110107130558.000|20110107130600.000|TR0|can't know what people's motivations are, 
20110107130600.000|20110107130602.000|TR0|but the fact of the matter is, there's 
20110107130602.000|20110107130604.000|TR0|political impact to everything that 
20110107130604.000|20110107130607.000|TR0|happens, even if you argue there's no 
20110107130607.000|20110107130609.000|TR0|political intent.  And when you look at 
20110107130609.000|20110107130611.000|TR0|the arrival of Chief of Staff Daley who is 
20110107130611.000|20110107130614.000|TR0|now going to come on, he is a centrist.  
20110107130614.000|20110107130616.000|TR0|And what has been the chief problem that 
20110107130616.000|20110107130618.000|TR0|President Obama has had?  He's lost the 
20110107130618.000|20110107130621.000|TR0|middle.
20110107130621.000|20110107130623.000|TR0|
20110107130623.000|20110107130625.000|TR0|So, when he brings on a centrist chief of 
20110107130625.000|20110107130628.000|TR0|staff and one from the business world as 
20110107130628.000|20110107130630.000|TR0|well as the political world, it tells you 
20110107130630.000|20110107130632.000|TR0|that: "A," he thinks he needs to make 
20110107130632.000|20110107130634.000|TR0|reparations with the business world, and 
20110107130634.000|20110107130637.000|TR0|"B," he's tacking to the center.  So, 
20110107130637.000|20110107130639.000|TR0|there is that.
20110107130639.000|20110107130641.000|TR0|
20110107130641.000|20110107130644.000|TR0|As far as a new economic team is concerned 
20110107130644.000|20110107130646.000|TR0|-- certainly, an economic team can help 
20110107130646.000|20110107130648.000|TR0|guide economic policy.  But as Christine 
20110107130648.000|20110107130651.000|TR0|just sort of talked about, the economy has 
20110107130651.000|20110107130653.000|TR0|this beat all to its own.  In some ways, 
20110107130653.000|20110107130655.000|TR0|it's immune to the machinations of people 
20110107130655.000|20110107130658.000|TR0|trying to stare it one way or another, 
20110107130658.000|20110107130700.000|TR0|just because it's so big and so hard for 
20110107130700.000|20110107130702.000|TR0|one policy or even a broad policy to 
20110107130702.000|20110107130704.000|TR0|really affect major change in the economy 
20110107130704.000|20110107130707.000|TR0|that's been in turmoil.
20110107130707.000|20110107130709.000|TR0|
20110107130709.000|20110107130711.000|TR0|So, to me, in a lot of ways, what's most 
20110107130711.000|20110107130714.000|TR0|important here about the new economic team 
20110107130714.000|20110107130716.000|TR0|that the president is bringing in is the 
20110107130716.000|20110107130718.000|TR0|fact that it is new.  That people look up 
20110107130718.000|20110107130721.000|TR0|and say, oh, he's switched his economic 
20110107130721.000|20110107130723.000|TR0|team and he's doing something.  He 
20110107130723.000|20110107130725.000|TR0|understands that the economy still needs 
20110107130725.000|20110107130728.000|TR0|some input from the federal government, 
20110107130728.000|20110107130730.000|TR0|either in terms of making it more 
20110107130730.000|20110107130732.000|TR0|business-friendly or in terms of giving it 
20110107130732.000|20110107130734.000|TR0|more stimulus money, whichever way you 
20110107130734.000|20110107130737.000|TR0|want to go.
20110107130737.000|20110107130739.000|TR0|
20110107130739.000|20110107130741.000|TR0|This is a president who is looking at the 
20110107130741.000|20110107130744.000|TR0|new economic team and saying, hey, we 
20110107130744.000|20110107130746.000|TR0|understand your problems.  We understand 
20110107130746.000|20110107130748.000|TR0|it's gotten as the economy isn't as good 
20110107130748.000|20110107130751.000|TR0|as we want it to be and here are my new 
20110107130751.000|20110107130753.000|TR0|guys.
20110107130753.000|20110107130755.000|TR0|
20110107130755.000|20110107130758.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Speaking of new guys and speaking 
20110107130758.000|20110107130800.000|TR0|of making amends with the business world, 
20110107130800.000|20110107130802.000|TR0|you have Bill Daley taking over as chief 
20110107130802.000|20110107130805.000|TR0|of staff and we've heard some complaints 
20110107130805.000|20110107130807.000|TR0|already from liberal groups like 
20110107130807.000|20110107130809.000|TR0|MoveOn.org, complaining that he's so close 
20110107130809.000|20110107130811.000|TR0|to big business, a former exec at JPMorgan 
20110107130811.000|20110107130814.000|TR0|Chase.  Will we see a lot of changes in 
20110107130814.000|20110107130816.000|TR0|the White House with Daley as the chief of 
20110107130816.000|20110107130818.000|TR0|staff?
20110107130818.000|20110107130821.000|TR0|
20110107130821.000|20110107130823.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  I think you will see more of an 
20110107130823.000|20110107130825.000|TR0|operational change than you're going to 
20110107130825.000|20110107130828.000|TR0|see -- again, it's symbolic.
20110107130828.000|20110107130830.000|TR0|
20110107130830.000|20110107130832.000|TR0|Look, I think the White House probably 
20110107130832.000|20110107130835.000|TR0|quite pleased that some of the more 
20110107130835.000|20110107130837.000|TR0|liberal parts of the Democratic Party are 
20110107130837.000|20110107130839.000|TR0|going after the Daley selection because, 
20110107130839.000|20110107130841.000|TR0|again, this is the president that wants to 
20110107130841.000|20110107130844.000|TR0|send a signal with the Daley selection -- 
20110107130844.000|20110107130846.000|TR0|and what's the signal?  The signal is, I'm 
20110107130846.000|20110107130848.000|TR0|not hostile to business -- which many in 
20110107130848.000|20110107130851.000|TR0|the business community think that he is, 
20110107130851.000|20110107130853.000|TR0|that his policies have been anti-business.
20110107130853.000|20110107130855.000|TR0|
20110107130855.000|20110107130858.000|TR0|So, he brings in a guy who spent the last 
20110107130858.000|20110107130900.000|TR0|seven years in a major bank.  He also 
20110107130900.000|20110107130902.000|TR0|brings in a man who has been critical of 
20110107130902.000|20110107130905.000|TR0|the Democratic Party for going too far to 
20110107130905.000|20110107130907.000|TR0|the left, who is an unabashed moderate 
20110107130907.000|20110107130909.000|TR0|Democrat.
20110107130909.000|20110107130911.000|TR0|
20110107130911.000|20110107130914.000|TR0|So, the fact that the left is attacking 
20110107130914.000|20110107130916.000|TR0|him and the Chamber of Commerce is, in 
20110107130916.000|20110107130918.000|TR0|fact, praising the Daley selection, tells 
20110107130918.000|20110107130921.000|TR0|you something about the way the president 
20110107130921.000|20110107130923.000|TR0|wants to go.  But I don't think in terms 
20110107130923.000|20110107130925.000|TR0|of a big picture economic course, you will 
20110107130925.000|20110107130928.000|TR0|look for a big change just because Bill 
20110107130928.000|20110107130930.000|TR0|Daley is coming in.  I think, 
20110107130930.000|20110107130932.000|TR0|operationally, he may run a tighter ship 
20110107130932.000|20110107130935.000|TR0|than Rahm Emanuel did.
20110107130935.000|20110107130937.000|TR0|
20110107130937.000|20110107130939.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right.  Candy, good to see 
20110107130939.000|20110107130941.000|TR0|you this morning.
20110107130941.000|20110107130944.000|TR0|
20110107130944.000|20110107130946.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  Thanks.
20110107130946.000|20110107130948.000|TR0|
20110107130948.000|20110107130951.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And we will see you again on 
20110107130951.000|20110107130953.000|TR0|Sunday.  "STATE OF THE UNION" with our 
20110107130953.000|20110107130955.000|TR0|Candy Crowley.  Sunday morning, 9:00 a.m. 
20110107130955.000|20110107130958.000|TR0|Eastern and then again at noon Eastern, 
20110107130958.000|20110107131000.000|TR0|right here on CNN.

20110107131007.000|20110107131009.000|TR0|Meantime, other news this morning.  Helen 
20110107131009.000|20110107131012.000|TR0|Thomas is back after a seven-month 
20110107131012.000|20110107131014.000|TR0|retirement or perhaps just a little hiatus 
20110107131014.000|20110107131016.000|TR0|there.  The 90-year-old journalist has a 
20110107131016.000|20110107131018.000|TR0|new job.  She's writing a column for 
20110107131018.000|20110107131021.000|TR0|"Falls Church News-Press" in northern 
20110107131021.000|20110107131023.000|TR0|Virginia.

20110107131025.000|20110107131028.000|TR0|Last summer, Thomas lost her job after 
20110107131028.000|20110107131030.000|TR0|making some disparaging remarks about 
20110107131030.000|20110107131032.000|TR0|Jews.  The founder of "News-Press" says 
20110107131032.000|20110107131035.000|TR0|she gave Thomas the job because she 
20110107131035.000|20110107131037.000|TR0|doesn't have believe that she harbors any 
20110107131037.000|20110107131039.000|TR0|ill will toward Jewish people.

20110107131042.000|20110107131044.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, they haven't got rid all of 
20110107131044.000|20110107131046.000|TR0|that other snow from that Christmas Day 
20110107131046.000|20110107131048.000|TR0|blizzard.  Now, New Yorkers are getting 
20110107131048.000|20110107131051.000|TR0|some more.

20110107131055.000|20110107131058.000|TR0|what's happening here in the Northeast.  
20110107131058.000|20110107131100.000|TR0|Some places got a lot of snow coming down 
20110107131100.000|20110107131102.000|TR0|on them already, but it's making its way 
20110107131102.000|20110107131105.000|TR0|-- already coming down a bit here in the 
20110107131105.000|20110107131107.000|TR0|Big Apple, expecting up to six inches of 
20110107131107.000|20110107131109.000|TR0|snow in some places.

20110107131112.000|20110107131114.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And New York City is still 
20110107131114.000|20110107131116.000|TR0|recovering from the weekend's -- Christmas 
20110107131116.000|20110107131118.000|TR0|weekend blizzard that dropped two feet of 
20110107131118.000|20110107131121.000|TR0|snow and basically shut down the city.  
20110107131121.000|20110107131123.000|TR0|New York's badly flawed cleanup effort an 
20110107131123.000|20110107131125.000|TR0|embarrassment for Mayor Bloomberg, but he 
20110107131125.000|20110107131128.000|TR0|says things will be different this time.

20110107131135.000|20110107131137.000|TR0|MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, NEW YORK:  For 
20110107131137.000|20110107131139.000|TR0|nine years, we have insisted on 
20110107131139.000|20110107131142.000|TR0|accountability from all agencies and from 
20110107131142.000|20110107131144.000|TR0|all city employees from top to bottom.  
20110107131144.000|20110107131146.000|TR0|And when something goes wrong, we stop 
20110107131146.000|20110107131149.000|TR0|everything, we find out what went wrong 
20110107131149.000|20110107131151.000|TR0|and we fix it.  And we can spend a lot of 
20110107131151.000|20110107131153.000|TR0|time should have, would have and could 
20110107131153.000|20110107131155.000|TR0|have.  My focus has always been: how can 
20110107131155.000|20110107131158.000|TR0|we do it better tomorrow?  And that's what 
20110107131158.000|20110107131200.000|TR0|New Yorkers expect from us and that's what 
20110107131200.000|20110107131202.000|TR0|we have an obligation to deliver and 
20110107131202.000|20110107131205.000|TR0|that's what we're going to do.

20110107131212.000|20110107131214.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, after last week's debacle, 
20110107131214.000|20110107131216.000|TR0|the mayor replaced the city's ambulance 
20110107131216.000|20110107131219.000|TR0|chief and two sanitation executives were 
20110107131219.000|20110107131221.000|TR0|reassigned, as well.
20110107131221.000|20110107131223.000|TR0|
20110107131223.000|20110107131225.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, they're getting another 
20110107131225.000|20110107131228.000|TR0|chance to prove themselves here in the 
20110107131228.000|20110107131230.000|TR0|city.  They can handle it.
20110107131230.000|20110107131232.000|TR0|
20110107131232.000|20110107131235.000|TR0|But Rob Marciano is joining us now.
20110107131235.000|20110107131237.000|TR0|
20110107131237.000|20110107131239.000|TR0|Rob, you said earlier they should get a 
20110107131239.000|20110107131242.000|TR0|chance here to really get A-plus because 
20110107131242.000|20110107131244.000|TR0|it's not going to be nearly as bad as it 
20110107131244.000|20110107131246.000|TR0|was before.
20110107131246.000|20110107131249.000|TR0|
20110107131249.000|20110107131251.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, 
20110107131251.000|20110107131253.000|TR0|this one is going to be a softball, I 
20110107131253.000|20110107131255.000|TR0|think, compared to the day after Christmas 
20110107131255.000|20110107131258.000|TR0|blizzard, that's for sure.
20110107131258.000|20110107131300.000|TR0|
20110107131300.000|20110107131302.000|TR0|But, nonetheless, there'll be some 
20110107131302.000|20110107131305.000|TR0|accumulation and it's coming during some 
20110107131305.000|20110107131307.000|TR0|peak rush hours.  So, decent storm as far 
20110107131307.000|20110107131309.000|TR0|as the size goes, but certainly, a complex 
20110107131309.000|20110107131312.000|TR0|one and it doesn't have the strength of 
20110107131312.000|20110107131314.000|TR0|that blizzard did last week.  That's good.
20110107131314.000|20110107131316.000|TR0|
20110107131316.000|20110107131319.000|TR0|But all -- stretching all the way back 
20110107131319.000|20110107131321.000|TR0|through parts of the Midwest and the Ohio 
20110107131321.000|20110107131323.000|TR0|River Valley, back to the Tennessee 
20110107131323.000|20110107131325.000|TR0|Valleys and then the most intense snowfall 
20110107131325.000|20110107131328.000|TR0|in central and southern Jersey, including 
20110107131328.000|20110107131330.000|TR0|Philadelphia and northern parts of 
20110107131330.000|20110107131332.000|TR0|Delaware, but already beginning to back of 
20110107131332.000|20110107131335.000|TR0|in Wilmington, at least the first band.  
20110107131335.000|20110107131337.000|TR0|There may be additional bands develop as 
20110107131337.000|20110107131339.000|TR0|it taps into Atlantic moisture. But we'll 
20110107131339.000|20110107131342.000|TR0|have to see how certain weather parameters 
20110107131342.000|20110107131344.000|TR0|set up.
20110107131344.000|20110107131346.000|TR0|
20110107131346.000|20110107131349.000|TR0|Right now, though, the snow is beginning 
20110107131349.000|20110107131351.000|TR0|to intensify across the New York City and 
20110107131351.000|20110107131353.000|TR0|the tri-state area there.  And some of the 
20110107131353.000|20110107131356.000|TR0|suburbs will start to see some 
20110107131356.000|20110107131358.000|TR0|accumulations on the roadways as well as 
20110107131358.000|20110107131400.000|TR0|we go through the late morning hours and 
20110107131400.000|20110107131402.000|TR0|that will make for a messy commute on the 
20110107131402.000|20110107131405.000|TR0|way home.
20110107131405.000|20110107131407.000|TR0|
20110107131407.000|20110107131409.000|TR0|We think two to five inches in spots 
20110107131409.000|20110107131412.000|TR0|across the tri-state area. Winter weather 
20110107131412.000|20110107131414.000|TR0|advisories are up.  Winter storm warnings 
20110107131414.000|20110107131416.000|TR0|further north in the Brookshire and the 
20110107131416.000|20110107131419.000|TR0|Catskills and the Adirondacks could see 
20110107131419.000|20110107131421.000|TR0|five to 10 inches of snow in those spots.  
20110107131421.000|20110107131423.000|TR0|Again, a fraction of what we saw just a 
20110107131423.000|20110107131426.000|TR0|week and a half ago.
20110107131426.000|20110107131428.000|TR0|
20110107131428.000|20110107131430.000|TR0|But delays now at Newark and Philadelphia. 
20110107131430.000|20110107131432.000|TR0| Ground stops there for the next 45 
20110107131432.000|20110107131435.000|TR0|minutes or so.  We'll probably see some 
20110107131435.000|20110107131437.000|TR0|further delays across the other 
20110107131437.000|20110107131439.000|TR0|metropolitan airports as we go through the 
20110107131439.000|20110107131442.000|TR0|afternoon.
20110107131442.000|20110107131444.000|TR0|
20110107131444.000|20110107131446.000|TR0|Cold air will be driving down behind the 
20110107131446.000|20110107131449.000|TR0|system.  So, this is affecting much, much 
20110107131449.000|20110107131451.000|TR0|more than just the northeastern third of 
20110107131451.000|20110107131453.000|TR0|the country.  The cold air will get all 
20110107131453.000|20110107131456.000|TR0|the way down to the Deep South. So that 
20110107131456.000|20110107131458.000|TR0|will make for another chilly weekend and, 
20110107131458.000|20110107131500.000|TR0|unfortunately, set the stage for 
20110107131500.000|20110107131502.000|TR0|potentially a winter storm here in Dixie, 
20110107131502.000|20110107131505.000|TR0|across parts of Alabama, Mississippi and 
20110107131505.000|20110107131507.000|TR0|Georgia as we get through Sunday and 
20110107131507.000|20110107131509.000|TR0|Monday.  So, a couple of other things to 
20110107131509.000|20110107131512.000|TR0|watch, as well.
20110107131512.000|20110107131514.000|TR0|
20110107131514.000|20110107131516.000|TR0|And as you know, not nearly as prepared 
20110107131516.000|20110107131519.000|TR0|resource-wise for snow removal here down 
20110107131519.000|20110107131521.000|TR0|South.  So, that could be a troublemaker 
20110107131521.000|20110107131523.000|TR0|come Monday morning.
20110107131523.000|20110107131526.000|TR0|
20110107131526.000|20110107131528.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes, here up North, just the in 
20110107131528.000|20110107131530.000|TR0|case the mayor forgot, one our local 
20110107131530.000|20110107131533.000|TR0|papers, "The New York Post," wanted to 
20110107131533.000|20110107131535.000|TR0|make sure, "Memo to Mayor Mike, it's going 
20110107131535.000|20110107131537.000|TR0|to snow today!  Post alerts city hall."  
20110107131537.000|20110107131539.000|TR0|So, they're having fun with it, as well.  
20110107131539.000|20110107131542.000|TR0|So, they're having a little bit of fun 
20110107131542.000|20110107131544.000|TR0|with as well.
20110107131544.000|20110107131546.000|TR0|
20110107131546.000|20110107131549.000|TR0|But, you know, it was a lot of the dailies 
20110107131549.000|20110107131551.000|TR0|that, you know, sort of brought to 
20110107131551.000|20110107131553.000|TR0|attention as well as our iReporters what 
20110107131553.000|20110107131556.000|TR0|was not happening that should have been 
20110107131556.000|20110107131558.000|TR0|happening in the city.

20110107131623.000|20110107131626.000|TR0|Well, coming up, two sisters are expected 
20110107131626.000|20110107131628.000|TR0|to walk out of prison here within the next 
20110107131628.000|20110107131630.000|TR0|hour and they spent 16 years in prison for 
20110107131630.000|20110107131633.000|TR0|an armed robbery.  They're walking out, 
20110107131633.000|20110107131635.000|TR0|though, early.  They had a life sentence.  
20110107131635.000|20110107131637.000|TR0|But they're getting out on one condition: 
20110107131637.000|20110107131639.000|TR0|one of them must donate a kidney to the 
20110107131639.000|20110107131642.000|TR0|other.  We'll tell you and a look back to 
20110107131642.000|20110107131644.000|TR0|give you at the actual crime itself and 
20110107131644.000|20110107131646.000|TR0|also the ethical issues this is bringing 
20110107131646.000|20110107131649.000|TR0|up.

20110107131712.000|20110107131714.000|TR0|up somewhere else this time around.  Would 
20110107131714.000|20110107131716.000|TR0|you believe she's showing at a consumer 
20110107131716.000|20110107131719.000|TR0|electronics show?

20110107131721.000|20110107131723.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Maybe she's looking for a new hat.

20110107131728.000|20110107131730.000|TR0|They probably have it. Do we have this 
20110107131730.000|20110107131733.000|TR0|video?  Gaga, there she is.  She's 
20110107131733.000|20110107131735.000|TR0|promoting some new high-tech gadgets of

20110107131740.000|20110107131742.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Pretty cool.  Look at that, she's 
20110107131742.000|20110107131744.000|TR0|a wearing a veil. It's a new line of 
20110107131744.000|20110107131746.000|TR0|Polaroid cameras and photo printers.  It

20110107131751.000|20110107131753.000|TR0|also, a portable printer so small that 
20110107131753.000|20110107131756.000|TR0|Gaga could take it to bars in her purse.

20110107131805.000|20110107131807.000|TR0|happening in town. Some of the big guys,

20110107131810.000|20110107131812.000|TR0| Are you one of these consumer geeks or

20110107131816.000|20110107131819.000|TR0|CHETRY:  No, I like seeing new gadgets 
20110107131819.000|20110107131821.000|TR0|out.  I like seeing the 3D TV where you 
20110107131821.000|20110107131823.000|TR0|don't have to wear the glasses and you can 
20110107131823.000|20110107131826.000|TR0|just watch it.  And also, I love when they 
20110107131826.000|20110107131828.000|TR0|get super small.  You know, storage 
20110107131828.000|20110107131830.000|TR0|devices, little tiny devices that are so 
20110107131830.000|20110107131833.000|TR0|small.

20110107131844.000|20110107131846.000|TR0|a lot of gadget geeks. They call it 
20110107131846.000|20110107131849.000|TR0|high-tech heaven.  That's our Dan Simon,

20110107131905.000|20110107131907.000|TR0|the next big thing, but big doesn't

20110107131916.000|20110107131919.000|TR0|SIMON (voice-over):  A television as thin 
20110107131919.000|20110107131921.000|TR0|as a quarter.  3D no less.  People looking 
20110107131921.000|20110107131923.000|TR0|at this LG screen, the world's thinnest, 
20110107131923.000|20110107131926.000|TR0|as if it was the Mona Lisa.  Mitsubishi,

20110107131935.000|20110107131937.000|TR0|be possible?
20110107131937.000|20110107131940.000|TR0|
20110107131940.000|20110107131942.000|TR0|DAVID NARANJO, MITSUBISHI:  No, I did not. 
20110107131942.000|20110107131944.000|TR0| Technology is really advanced to a point 
20110107131944.000|20110107131947.000|TR0|we can do this at a very affordable price 
20110107131947.000|20110107131949.000|TR0|point.

20110107131951.000|20110107131953.000|TR0|SIMON:  That is if you consider just under 
20110107131953.000|20110107131956.000|TR0|$6,000 affordable.  As the consumer

20110107131958.000|20110107132000.000|TR0|organizers (ph) believe is one of the 
20110107132000.000|20110107132003.000|TR0|largest CES shows ever in Las Vegas.  
20110107132003.000|20110107132005.000|TR0|Company executives seem convinced that 
20110107132005.000|20110107132007.000|TR0|consumers are ready to start buying. 
20110107132007.000|20110107132010.000|TR0|Hollywood executive, Jeffrey Katzenberg, 
20110107132010.000|20110107132012.000|TR0|of DreamWorks Spain dismissed those who 
20110107132012.000|20110107132014.000|TR0|say 3D television is not going to catch on.

20110107132017.000|20110107132019.000|TR0|JEFFREY KATZENBERG, DREAMWORKS ANIMATION:  
20110107132019.000|20110107132021.000|TR0|If you look at the introduction of the

20110107132023.000|20110107132026.000|TR0|theaters, moved to television, moved to 
20110107132026.000|20110107132028.000|TR0|print, moved throughout the world in which 
20110107132028.000|20110107132030.000|TR0|today, everything is in color.  You know?  
20110107132030.000|20110107132033.000|TR0|And so, I think 3D, it's how we see.
20110107132033.000|20110107132035.000|TR0|
20110107132035.000|20110107132037.000|TR0|SIMON:  The 3D universe is extending the 
20110107132037.000|20110107132040.000|TR0|consumer camcorders. This attachment turns 
20110107132040.000|20110107132042.000|TR0|regular video images into 3D.
20110107132042.000|20110107132044.000|TR0|
20110107132044.000|20110107132047.000|TR0|SIMON:  This is a normal HD camera, but if 
20110107132047.000|20110107132049.000|TR0|you take this accessory, suddenly, you 
20110107132049.000|20110107132051.000|TR0|have a 3D camera, right?

20110107132056.000|20110107132058.000|TR0| I mean, I think these are camcorders that 
20110107132058.000|20110107132100.000|TR0|are designed to work with this 3D 
20110107132100.000|20110107132103.000|TR0|converter.  This is Panasonic's approach,

20110107132121.000|20110107132124.000|TR0|supposed to any other watch, you need to 
20110107132124.000|20110107132126.000|TR0|have a separate cable to plug it in.  This 
20110107132126.000|20110107132128.000|TR0|thing goes straight into your Mac or PC.

20110107132140.000|20110107132142.000|TR0|it's only the size of a dime.  As

20110107132349.000|20110107132351.000|TR0|HOLMES:  This is a story this morning that 
20110107132351.000|20110107132354.000|TR0|had a lot of people scratching their 
20110107132354.000|20110107132356.000|TR0|heads, but God bless the young man.  
20110107132356.000|20110107132358.000|TR0|Andrew Luck is who we're talking about.  
20110107132358.000|20110107132401.000|TR0|He was expected to be the number one pick 
20110107132401.000|20110107132403.000|TR0|in this year's NFL draft.  He would rather 
20110107132403.000|20110107132405.000|TR0|forego that opportunity to make tens and 
20110107132405.000|20110107132407.000|TR0|tens of millions of dollars right now, at 
20110107132407.000|20110107132410.000|TR0|least, and go back to school, at Stanford. 
20110107132410.000|20110107132412.000|TR0| He's a quarterback there.
20110107132412.000|20110107132414.000|TR0|
20110107132414.000|20110107132417.000|TR0|He just led them to a big victory in the 
20110107132417.000|20110107132419.000|TR0|bowl game.  They were 12-1, so it's not a 
20110107132419.000|20110107132421.000|TR0|whole lot more if he come back and 
20110107132421.000|20110107132424.000|TR0|accomplish athletically, but academically, 
20110107132424.000|20110107132426.000|TR0|he's going to go back, get his degree, 
20110107132426.000|20110107132428.000|TR0|he'll still be a good quarterback.  A lot 
20110107132428.000|20110107132431.000|TR0|of people say this is a risk of sorts, but 
20110107132431.000|20110107132433.000|TR0|you have to commend the young man for 
20110107132433.000|20110107132435.000|TR0|doing it because I sure would not.
20110107132435.000|20110107132437.000|TR0|

20110107132442.000|20110107132444.000|TR0|CHETRY:  $40 million, $50 million on the 
20110107132444.000|20110107132447.000|TR0|table.  It's tempting to go, you know, but 
20110107132447.000|20110107132449.000|TR0|his dad said he's old school.  You know, 
20110107132449.000|20110107132451.000|TR0|some people are saying because the 
20110107132451.000|20110107132454.000|TR0|potential work stoppage is because you 
20110107132454.000|20110107132456.000|TR0|would have gotten drafted by the Panthers.
20110107132456.000|20110107132458.000|TR0|
20110107132458.000|20110107132501.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Who are very good.
20110107132501.000|20110107132503.000|TR0|
20110107132503.000|20110107132505.000|TR0|CHETRY:  So, maybe, he's going to wait 
20110107132505.000|20110107132508.000|TR0|until next year, see if things get better, 
20110107132508.000|20110107132510.000|TR0|but you're right.  Taking a gamble.  Good 
20110107132510.000|20110107132512.000|TR0|for him. Good luck.
20110107132512.000|20110107132514.000|TR0|
20110107132514.000|20110107132517.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Other work or job (ph) for him.
20110107132517.000|20110107132519.000|TR0|
20110107132519.000|20110107132521.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, he has six children, he and 
20110107132521.000|20110107132524.000|TR0|his lovely wife, 23 grandchildren.  Now, 
20110107132524.000|20110107132526.000|TR0|Jim McCullar is even richer, $190 million 
20110107132526.000|20110107132528.000|TR0|richer. Jim and Carolyne of Washington 
20110107132528.000|20110107132531.000|TR0|State, they came forward to claim their 
20110107132531.000|20110107132533.000|TR0|half of $380 million mega millions 
20110107132533.000|20110107132535.000|TR0|jackpot.  He's a Vietnam vet, a retired 
20110107132535.000|20110107132538.000|TR0|bowling employee.  This is how he reacted 
20110107132538.000|20110107132540.000|TR0|at the moment he realized he was rich.

20110107132551.000|20110107132554.000|TR0|She looked and she studied it, she looked 
20110107132554.000|20110107132556.000|TR0|and she studied it and she looked at me 
20110107132556.000|20110107132558.000|TR0|and screamed!

20110107132608.000|20110107132610.000|TR0|I looked at her and I started crying, and 
20110107132610.000|20110107132612.000|TR0|all she could say was is this real?  Is 
20110107132612.000|20110107132614.000|TR0|this real? And just -- I pinched myself 
20110107132614.000|20110107132617.000|TR0|already.  We're awake, and this is real 
20110107132617.000|20110107132619.000|TR0|and what are we going to do?  What are we 
20110107132619.000|20110107132621.000|TR0|going to do?  And I say, I have no idea, 
20110107132621.000|20110107132624.000|TR0|but we better hide.

20110107132635.000|20110107132638.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Maybe his first instinct was 
20110107132638.000|20110107132640.000|TR0|right.  We better hide.
20110107132640.000|20110107132642.000|TR0|
20110107132642.000|20110107132644.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And they didn't, though.

20110107132647.000|20110107132649.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Oh, no.  I mean, the lottery 
20110107132649.000|20110107132651.000|TR0|officials, they love when they come out 
20110107132651.000|20110107132654.000|TR0|and tell their story.  I mean, look, I 
20110107132654.000|20110107132656.000|TR0|mean, that's about as good story as you 
20110107132656.000|20110107132658.000|TR0|can get.  These two worked hard.  They say 
20110107132658.000|20110107132701.000|TR0|there were times when they thought they 
20110107132701.000|20110107132703.000|TR0|had nothing.  They had to peel bark off 
20110107132703.000|20110107132705.000|TR0|the trees, let it dry for -- what did you 
20110107132705.000|20110107132708.000|TR0|say? (INAUDIBLE). I mean, and didn't have 
20110107132708.000|20110107132710.000|TR0|it easy, but now, things are great.

20110107132712.000|20110107132715.000|TR0|Jim and Carolyn played their birthdays.

20110107132717.000|20110107132719.000|TR0|42 and 4, 25, 47 to hit the jackpot.  
20110107132719.000|20110107132721.000|TR0|They've used the system before.  They won 
20110107132721.000|20110107132724.000|TR0|18 grand with those numbers in the Oregon 
20110107132724.000|20110107132726.000|TR0|State Lottery.  Yes.  They have just upped 
20110107132726.000|20110107132728.000|TR0|the ante this time, and the holder of the 
20110107132728.000|20110107132731.000|TR0|other winning mega million ticket, by the

20110107132733.000|20110107132735.000|TR0|up with a better story than these two. 
20110107132735.000|20110107132738.000|TR0|They haven't come forward yet.

20110107132742.000|20110107132745.000|TR0|going to start playing their birthdays in 
20110107132745.000|20110107132747.000|TR0|the lottery.  It clearly works.

20110107132751.000|20110107132754.000|TR0|now if they would like to.  P. Diddy is 
20110107132754.000|20110107132756.000|TR0|hanging out right now, we're told, on this 
20110107132756.000|20110107132758.000|TR0|thing. This is the high-tech super yacht 
20110107132758.000|20110107132801.000|TR0|that is pretty much completely controlled 
20110107132801.000|20110107132803.000|TR0|by, you guessed it, an iPad.  It controls 
20110107132803.000|20110107132805.000|TR0|the temperature inside, the cabin, lights, 
20110107132805.000|20110107132808.000|TR0|the blinds, entertainment, you name it.  
20110107132808.000|20110107132810.000|TR0|P. Diddy is on it apparently with his 
20110107132810.000|20110107132812.000|TR0|family right now.

20110107132819.000|20110107132821.000|TR0|Here's how much it costs.  You probably 
20110107132821.000|20110107132824.000|TR0|couldn't even guess, but now that I tell 
20110107132824.000|20110107132826.000|TR0|you, you're going to say that doesn't make 
20110107132826.000|20110107132828.000|TR0|any sense.  $850,000 for one week.

20110107132835.000|20110107132838.000|TR0|HOLMES:  One week.  On the thing.  
20110107132838.000|20110107132840.000|TR0|$690,000 for I think just the rent and 
20110107132840.000|20110107132842.000|TR0|then the extra money comes to staff, food, 
20110107132842.000|20110107132845.000|TR0|all this other stuff.  That's a lot of 
20110107132845.000|20110107132847.000|TR0|money for a week.
20110107132847.000|20110107132849.000|TR0|
20110107132849.000|20110107132851.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Like complimentary iPad.  And Jim 
20110107132851.000|20110107132854.000|TR0|and Carolyn could just buy it outright.

20110107132940.000|20110107132942.000|TR0|out on one condition.  One of the sisters 
20110107132942.000|20110107132945.000|TR0|has to give a kidney to the other.  We're 
20110107132945.000|20110107132947.000|TR0|going to be talking to the attorney in the 
20110107132947.000|20110107132949.000|TR0|case and standing by for them to walk out 
20110107132949.000|20110107132952.000|TR0|of prison.
20110107132952.000|20110107132954.000|TR0|
20110107132954.000|20110107132956.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Also, are you looking for a job?  
20110107132956.000|20110107132958.000|TR0|We are just minutes away from the big job 
20110107132958.000|20110107133001.000|TR0|report, this monthly job reports coming up 
20110107133001.000|20110107133003.000|TR0|in about five minutes.  And there are very 
20110107133003.000|20110107133005.000|TR0|big hopes that we're going to hear some 
20110107133005.000|20110107133008.000|TR0|good news, finally things turning around.  
20110107133008.000|20110107133010.000|TR0|We're going to have a live report coming 
20110107133010.000|20110107133012.000|TR0|up.
20110107133012.000|20110107133015.000|TR0|
20110107133015.000|20110107133017.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110107133017.000|20110107133019.000|TR0|
20110107133019.000|20110107133022.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right.  Getting close to the 
20110107133022.000|20110107133024.000|TR0|bottom of the hour here.  We're also 
20110107133024.000|20110107133026.000|TR0|getting close to the release of two 
20110107133026.000|20110107133028.000|TR0|sisters who have been waiting some 16 
20110107133028.000|20110107133031.000|TR0|years to walk out of prison.  They could 
20110107133031.000|20110107133033.000|TR0|be doing that.  We're expecting here in 
20110107133033.000|20110107133035.000|TR0|the next 30 minutes.  We're talking about 
20110107133035.000|20110107133038.000|TR0|Gladys and Jamie Scott who went to prison 
20110107133038.000|20110107133040.000|TR0|for a crime they say they didn't commit.
20110107133040.000|20110107133042.000|TR0|
20110107133042.000|20110107133045.000|TR0|But even if they were guilty, some people 
20110107133045.000|20110107133047.000|TR0|say they should have never gotten life 
20110107133047.000|20110107133049.000|TR0|sentences for it.  They were played apart 
20110107133049.000|20110107133052.000|TR0|accessories in an armed robbery that 
20110107133052.000|20110107133054.000|TR0|netted $11 and no one was hurt, but a 
20110107133054.000|20110107133056.000|TR0|condition of their release now in 
20110107133056.000|20110107133059.000|TR0|Mississippi is that one sister has to 
20110107133059.000|20110107133101.000|TR0|donate a kidney to the other.  I want to 
20110107133101.000|20110107133103.000|TR0|bring in their attorney here, Chokwe 
20110107133103.000|20110107133105.000|TR0|Lumumba.  He's a lawyer for the two 
20110107133105.000|20110107133108.000|TR0|sisters, joins us now from Pearl, 
20110107133108.000|20110107133110.000|TR0|Mississippi.
20110107133110.000|20110107133112.000|TR0|
20110107133112.000|20110107133115.000|TR0|Sir, thank you for being with us, and I 
20110107133115.000|20110107133117.000|TR0|know you're standing by there.  Do I have 
20110107133117.000|20110107133119.000|TR0|that right, in the next 30 minutes, we 
20110107133119.000|20110107133122.000|TR0|could see these two ladies walk out of 
20110107133122.000|20110107133124.000|TR0|prison?
20110107133124.000|20110107133126.000|TR0|
20110107133126.000|20110107133129.000|TR0|CHOKWE LUMUMBA, ATTORNEY FOR GLADYS AND 
20110107133129.000|20110107133131.000|TR0|JAMIE SCOTT:  Brother Holmes, you're 
20110107133131.000|20110107133133.000|TR0|absolutely right, and we're all just 
20110107133133.000|20110107133135.000|TR0|delighted, we're excited.  We know they're 
20110107133135.000|20110107133138.000|TR0|excited because we've talked to them over 
20110107133138.000|20110107133140.000|TR0|the last several hours, and so, we're 
20110107133140.000|20110107133142.000|TR0|ready to get it on and get them on out of 
20110107133142.000|20110107133145.000|TR0|there.
20110107133145.000|20110107133147.000|TR0|
20110107133147.000|20110107133149.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, give us an idea of the 
20110107133149.000|20110107133152.000|TR0|medical condition right now.  One sister 
20110107133152.000|20110107133154.000|TR0|has to donate a kidney to the other.  Just 
20110107133154.000|20110107133156.000|TR0|how bad of is she?
20110107133156.000|20110107133159.000|TR0|
20110107133159.000|20110107133201.000|TR0|LUMUMBA:  Well, first of all, the sister 
20110107133201.000|20110107133203.000|TR0|that needs the kidney is Jamie Scott.  She 
20110107133203.000|20110107133205.000|TR0|is in bad shape as far as kidneys are 
20110107133205.000|20110107133208.000|TR0|concerned. She's level five, which is the 
20110107133208.000|20110107133210.000|TR0|highest level of renal failure.  So, she 
20110107133210.000|20110107133212.000|TR0|needs the kidney.  There's no question.  
20110107133212.000|20110107133215.000|TR0|Her sister who's going to donate the 
20110107133215.000|20110107133217.000|TR0|kidney is Gladys.
20110107133217.000|20110107133219.000|TR0|
20110107133219.000|20110107133222.000|TR0|Now, she's going to donate it if her 
20110107133222.000|20110107133224.000|TR0|kidneys are compatible. Those studies have 
20110107133224.000|20110107133226.000|TR0|not been done yet.  The way that that came 
20110107133226.000|20110107133229.000|TR0|about is that Gladys offered a kidney to 
20110107133229.000|20110107133231.000|TR0|her sister long ago even before release 
20110107133231.000|20110107133233.000|TR0|was even a question.  The prison, 
20110107133233.000|20110107133235.000|TR0|unfortunately, didn't do anything in order 
20110107133235.000|20110107133238.000|TR0|to test her or to make that possible or to 
20110107133238.000|20110107133240.000|TR0|make a transplant period, possible.  But 
20110107133240.000|20110107133242.000|TR0|at this point in time, I think the 
20110107133242.000|20110107133245.000|TR0|governor has picked up on Gladys' 
20110107133245.000|20110107133247.000|TR0|willingness to donate the kidney to make 
20110107133247.000|20110107133249.000|TR0|that a condition of her release.
20110107133249.000|20110107133252.000|TR0|
20110107133252.000|20110107133254.000|TR0|HOLMES:  I'm sorry there.  How quickly 
20110107133254.000|20110107133256.000|TR0|will that work take place once she gets 
20110107133256.000|20110107133259.000|TR0|out?  How quickly will you get her to some 
20110107133259.000|20110107133301.000|TR0|medical facility to see if she can, they 
20110107133301.000|20110107133303.000|TR0|are compatible?
20110107133303.000|20110107133306.000|TR0|
20110107133306.000|20110107133308.000|TR0|LUMUMBA:  We're going to get them to 
20110107133308.000|20110107133310.000|TR0|medical facilities where treatment for 
20110107133310.000|20110107133312.000|TR0|Jamie's going to take place immediately.  
20110107133312.000|20110107133315.000|TR0|And then the doctors are going to have to 
20110107133315.000|20110107133317.000|TR0|tell us how long it takes to test.  We're 
20110107133317.000|20110107133319.000|TR0|not absolutely sure.  But we don't expect 
20110107133319.000|20110107133322.000|TR0|it to take a long time, Brother Holmes, 
20110107133322.000|20110107133324.000|TR0|not a long time at all.       HOLMES:  
20110107133324.000|20110107133326.000|TR0|Have you got indications from the governor 
20110107133326.000|20110107133329.000|TR0|there?  This was a condition of her 
20110107133329.000|20110107133331.000|TR0|release.  So what if they're not 
20110107133331.000|20110107133333.000|TR0|compatible or if Gladys changed the mind, 
20110107133333.000|20110107133336.000|TR0|not saying she would, but what if the 
20110107133336.000|20110107133338.000|TR0|kidney transplant doesn't take place, can 
20110107133338.000|20110107133340.000|TR0|the governor say they should be put back 
20110107133340.000|20110107133342.000|TR0|in prison?
20110107133342.000|20110107133345.000|TR0|
20110107133345.000|20110107133347.000|TR0|LUMUMBA:  Let me say two things.  Number 
20110107133347.000|20110107133349.000|TR0|one is I don't think that the governor's 
20110107133349.000|20110107133352.000|TR0|-- the governor's office told me it's not 
20110107133352.000|20110107133354.000|TR0|a problem if the kidney transplant is not 
20110107133354.000|20110107133356.000|TR0|possible.  Number two, we would rather 
20110107133356.000|20110107133359.000|TR0|talk about this once they're out.  When 
20110107133359.000|20110107133401.000|TR0|you're in, the governor can put any 
20110107133401.000|20110107133403.000|TR0|condition on you because you have no right 
20110107133403.000|20110107133406.000|TR0|to come out.
20110107133406.000|20110107133408.000|TR0|
20110107133408.000|20110107133410.000|TR0|Once you're out, there's considerable 
20110107133410.000|20110107133412.000|TR0|concern about whether you can make 
20110107133412.000|20110107133415.000|TR0|somebody go back in because they failed to 
20110107133415.000|20110107133417.000|TR0|give a body part. So we feel confident 
20110107133417.000|20110107133419.000|TR0|that that won't be a problem if you get my 
20110107133419.000|20110107133422.000|TR0|drift.
20110107133422.000|20110107133424.000|TR0|
20110107133424.000|20110107133426.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Yes.
20110107133426.000|20110107133429.000|TR0|
20110107133429.000|20110107133431.000|TR0|LUMUMBA:  But at the same time, you know, 
20110107133431.000|20110107133433.000|TR0|and then I think the governor had his own 
20110107133433.000|20110107133436.000|TR0|political reasons for attaching that.  He 
20110107133436.000|20110107133438.000|TR0|may be trying to convince people in the 
20110107133438.000|20110107133440.000|TR0|state that this is an economic benefit to 
20110107133440.000|20110107133442.000|TR0|the state and so that's why he did it.  We 
20110107133442.000|20110107133445.000|TR0|know why it should have happened because 
20110107133445.000|20110107133447.000|TR0|they shouldn't be there in the first place.
20110107133447.000|20110107133449.000|TR0|
20110107133449.000|20110107133452.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And to wrap up on the last couple 
20110107133452.000|20110107133454.000|TR0|points here, you talked about the $200,000 
20110107133454.000|20110107133456.000|TR0|the governor said costing the state.  That 
20110107133456.000|20110107133459.000|TR0|was a condition of their release or a 
20110107133459.000|20110107133501.000|TR0|reason for the release.  He also said this 
20110107133501.000|20110107133503.000|TR0|is a humanitarian case here in letting 
20110107133503.000|20110107133506.000|TR0|them out.
20110107133506.000|20110107133508.000|TR0|
20110107133508.000|20110107133510.000|TR0|But he didn't make a judgment or give his 
20110107133510.000|20110107133513.000|TR0|opinion on the actual merits of their 
20110107133513.000|20110107133515.000|TR0|conviction or the merits of the sentence 
20110107133515.000|20110107133517.000|TR0|that they got.  And this is a conditional 
20110107133517.000|20110107133519.000|TR0|release, not a pardon.  Are you going to 
20110107133519.000|20110107133522.000|TR0|seek a pardon for these young ladies at 
20110107133522.000|20110107133524.000|TR0|some point?
20110107133524.000|20110107133526.000|TR0|
20110107133526.000|20110107133529.000|TR0|LUMUMBA:  Oh, yes, we will.  We're not 
20110107133529.000|20110107133531.000|TR0|going to lay down the guns.  We are going 
20110107133531.000|20110107133533.000|TR0|to keep fighting in order to get them 
20110107133533.000|20110107133536.000|TR0|totally exonerated.  We expect it to come 
20110107133536.000|20110107133538.000|TR0|by pardon but it could come by court 
20110107133538.000|20110107133540.000|TR0|action if necessary.
20110107133540.000|20110107133543.000|TR0|
20110107133543.000|20110107133545.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right, again, attorney for 
20110107133545.000|20110107133547.000|TR0|the two sisters, Gladys and Jamie, 
20110107133547.000|20110107133549.000|TR0|expected to walk out of prison maybe in 30 
20110107133549.000|20110107133552.000|TR0|minutes or time. Thank you for your time.  
20110107133552.000|20110107133554.000|TR0|I know it's a big day for you.  Thank you 
20110107133554.000|20110107133556.000|TR0|so much for spending some time with us.
20110107133556.000|20110107133559.000|TR0|
20110107133559.000|20110107133601.000|TR0|LUMUMBA:  Thank you, we appreciate it.  
20110107133601.000|20110107133603.000|TR0|Thank you to your listening and viewing 
20110107133603.000|20110107133606.000|TR0|audience.  Thank you very much.
20110107133606.000|20110107133608.000|TR0|
20110107133608.000|20110107133610.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Thanks so much.  Following the 
20110107133610.000|20110107133613.000|TR0|release, the two sisters are scheduled to 
20110107133613.000|20110107133615.000|TR0|hold a press conference around 3:00 
20110107133615.000|20110107133617.000|TR0|Eastern time. After that, our Soledad 
20110107133617.000|20110107133619.000|TR0|O'Brien is going down and sitting down 
20110107133619.000|20110107133622.000|TR0|with these two sisters so you can look for 
20110107133622.000|20110107133624.000|TR0|that here on our network.
20110107133624.000|20110107133626.000|TR0|
20110107133626.000|20110107133629.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And just in to CNN now, the 
20110107133629.000|20110107133631.000|TR0|December jobs report just released.  We 
20110107133631.000|20110107133633.000|TR0|have unemployment falling to 9.4 percent 
20110107133633.000|20110107133636.000|TR0|and 103,000 jobs created.
20110107133636.000|20110107133638.000|TR0|
20110107133638.000|20110107133640.000|TR0|So what do those numbers mean?  Joining us 
20110107133640.000|20110107133643.000|TR0|to break it down, our Christine Romans as 
20110107133643.000|20110107133645.000|TR0|well as Lakshman Achuthan, the economic 
20110107133645.000|20110107133647.000|TR0|analyst and director of the Economic Cycle 
20110107133647.000|20110107133650.000|TR0|Research Institute.  Thanks to both of 
20110107133650.000|20110107133652.000|TR0|you.  Is this what you were expecting or 
20110107133652.000|20110107133654.000|TR0|did you think it would be a little higher?
20110107133654.000|20110107133656.000|TR0|
20110107133656.000|20110107133659.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS 
20110107133659.000|20110107133701.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Some people were saying a 
20110107133701.000|20110107133703.000|TR0|lot more jobs created.  The surprise is 
20110107133703.000|20110107133706.000|TR0|unemployment rate that fell to 9.4 
20110107133706.000|20110107133708.000|TR0|percent.  That's the best unemployment 
20110107133708.000|20110107133710.000|TR0|rate since May of 2009.
20110107133710.000|20110107133713.000|TR0|
20110107133713.000|20110107133715.000|TR0|Where were the jobs created?  There were 
20110107133715.000|20110107133717.000|TR0|created in leisure and hospitality, end of 
20110107133717.000|20110107133720.000|TR0|the year, hotels, restaurants and the like 
20110107133720.000|20110107133722.000|TR0|up 47,000 jobs there.  Health care created 
20110107133722.000|20110107133724.000|TR0|jobs, temporary staffing agencies added 
20110107133724.000|20110107133726.000|TR0|jobs, as well.  For 2010, you saw strong 
20110107133726.000|20110107133729.000|TR0|growth from the temporary agencies, almost 
20110107133729.000|20110107133731.000|TR0|500,000 jobs created in the year of 
20110107133731.000|20110107133733.000|TR0|temporary agencies.
20110107133733.000|20110107133736.000|TR0|
20110107133736.000|20110107133738.000|TR0|A couple of things also to note for 
20110107133738.000|20110107133740.000|TR0|November and October, we picked up another 
20110107133740.000|20110107133743.000|TR0|70,000 jobs we didn't know about because 
20110107133743.000|20110107133745.000|TR0|of revisions and a little bit better than 
20110107133745.000|20110107133747.000|TR0|we thought.  But you are right, overall 
20110107133747.000|20110107133750.000|TR0|job creation of 103,000.  We need more 
20110107133750.000|20110107133752.000|TR0|than that.  We need more than that.
20110107133752.000|20110107133754.000|TR0|
20110107133754.000|20110107133756.000|TR0|It's not as much as people thought earlier 
20110107133756.000|20110107133759.000|TR0|this week but the drop in the unemployment 
20110107133759.000|20110107133801.000|TR0|rate, triple digit job gains again, we'll 
20110107133801.000|20110107133803.000|TR0|agree we're going in the right direction 
20110107133803.000|20110107133806.000|TR0|in jobs.
20110107133806.000|20110107133808.000|TR0|
20110107133808.000|20110107133810.000|TR0|LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN, ECONOMIC ANALYST:  The 
20110107133810.000|20110107133813.000|TR0|first takeaway is no recession.  Right?  
20110107133813.000|20110107133815.000|TR0|Just a couple of months ago everybody's 
20110107133815.000|20110107133817.000|TR0|double-dip recession.  You don't add these 
20110107133817.000|20110107133820.000|TR0|kinds of jobs and slip into recession. 
20110107133820.000|20110107133822.000|TR0|That's incompatible.  If you average out, 
20110107133822.000|20110107133824.000|TR0|because these are jumpy numbers, November, 
20110107133824.000|20110107133826.000|TR0|December, 80,000-plus is not enough to 
20110107133826.000|20110107133829.000|TR0|heal.  We still need to regain another 
20110107133829.000|20110107133831.000|TR0|seven million jobs to make up what we've 
20110107133831.000|20110107133833.000|TR0|lost.
20110107133833.000|20110107133836.000|TR0|
20110107133836.000|20110107133838.000|TR0|ROMANS:  That's going to take years.
20110107133838.000|20110107133840.000|TR0|
20110107133840.000|20110107133843.000|TR0|ACHUTHAN:  That's going to take a very 
20110107133843.000|20110107133845.000|TR0|long time.  Even if -- look.  Our outlook 
20110107133845.000|20110107133847.000|TR0|is a revival in growth that's going to 
20110107133847.000|20110107133850.000|TR0|begin by the springtime, that will include 
20110107133850.000|20110107133852.000|TR0|a firming jobs market.  It is not in this 
20110107133852.000|20110107133854.000|TR0|report.  It's not here yet.  It is still 
20110107133854.000|20110107133857.000|TR0|in front of us.
20110107133857.000|20110107133859.000|TR0|
20110107133859.000|20110107133901.000|TR0|And 90 percent of us work in the sector 
20110107133901.000|20110107133903.000|TR0|and that's where nine out of ten Americans 
20110107133903.000|20110107133906.000|TR0|work.  And aside from temp jobs and retail 
20110107133906.000|20110107133908.000|TR0|stuff, it's not kicked in yet.  That is 
20110107133908.000|20110107133910.000|TR0|going to I think happen around this 
20110107133910.000|20110107133913.000|TR0|spring.  So slow and steady right now, no 
20110107133913.000|20110107133915.000|TR0|new recession, no new leg down, but we 
20110107133915.000|20110107133917.000|TR0|still have to wait a little bit to get 
20110107133917.000|20110107133920.000|TR0|some jobs creation.
20110107133920.000|20110107133922.000|TR0|
20110107133922.000|20110107133924.000|TR0|ROMANS:  Do you agree people who are in 
20110107133924.000|20110107133927.000|TR0|the top of the career or the science, 
20110107133927.000|20110107133929.000|TR0|technology, engineering, math seeing a 
20110107133929.000|20110107133931.000|TR0|different labor market?
20110107133931.000|20110107133933.000|TR0|
20110107133933.000|20110107133936.000|TR0|ACHUTHAN:  Totally.       ROMANS:  They're 
20110107133936.000|20110107133938.000|TR0|seeing action, job offers and raises and 
20110107133938.000|20110107133940.000|TR0|job offers.  And there is this big chunk 
20110107133940.000|20110107133943.000|TR0|of millions of people who have been left 
20110107133943.000|20110107133945.000|TR0|behind.
20110107133945.000|20110107133947.000|TR0|
20110107133947.000|20110107133950.000|TR0|ACHUTHAN:  Absolutely.
20110107133950.000|20110107133952.000|TR0|
20110107133952.000|20110107133954.000|TR0|ROMANS:  That's the political story for 
20110107133954.000|20110107133957.000|TR0|the year, I think.  Can the president if 
20110107133957.000|20110107133959.000|TR0|we keep adding jobs every month, can the 
20110107133959.000|20110107134001.000|TR0|president hit on that heading into a 
20110107134001.000|20110107134003.000|TR0|reelection if you have so many people who 
20110107134003.000|20110107134006.000|TR0|are out of work and have been for six 
20110107134006.000|20110107134008.000|TR0|months or longer?
20110107134008.000|20110107134010.000|TR0|
20110107134010.000|20110107134013.000|TR0|ACHUTHAN:  It's going to make a lot of 
20110107134013.000|20110107134015.000|TR0|people feel better the unemployment number 
20110107134015.000|20110107134017.000|TR0|not go up, first of all.
20110107134017.000|20110107134020.000|TR0|
20110107134020.000|20110107134022.000|TR0|HOLMES:  We get into the numbers, the 
20110107134022.000|20110107134024.000|TR0|average person hears 9.8 percent and hear 
20110107134024.000|20110107134027.000|TR0|it is going down.  People start to feel a 
20110107134027.000|20110107134029.000|TR0|little better.  It's high, sure.
20110107134029.000|20110107134031.000|TR0|
20110107134031.000|20110107134034.000|TR0|ACHUTHAN:  It's a critical point you're 
20110107134034.000|20110107134036.000|TR0|making because most people have a job, 
20110107134036.000|20110107134038.000|TR0|actually.  We focus on the people who 
20110107134038.000|20110107134040.000|TR0|don't with the dire straits they're in but 
20110107134040.000|20110107134043.000|TR0|people with a job.  But the psychology of 
20110107134043.000|20110107134045.000|TR0|seeing the expansion continue, the jobs 
20110107134045.000|20110107134047.000|TR0|coming back slowly, eases -- it gives you 
20110107134047.000|20110107134050.000|TR0|license to actually go out and, you know, 
20110107134050.000|20110107134052.000|TR0|get that thing you've been looking at for 
20110107134052.000|20110107134054.000|TR0|two years and now you finally buy it.
20110107134054.000|20110107134057.000|TR0|
20110107134057.000|20110107134059.000|TR0|CHETRY:  You say a lack of demand, if 
20110107134059.000|20110107134101.000|TR0|we're not buying -- tightening the belts 
20110107134101.000|20110107134104.000|TR0|and not buying things and no demand, some 
20110107134104.000|20110107134106.000|TR0|of it feeds on itself.
20110107134106.000|20110107134108.000|TR0|
20110107134108.000|20110107134110.000|TR0|ACHUTHAN:  We call it frugality fatigue.  
20110107134110.000|20110107134113.000|TR0|That's wearing on us.
20110107134113.000|20110107134115.000|TR0|
20110107134115.000|20110107134117.000|TR0|ROMANS:  I'm tired of being frugal.  I 
20110107134117.000|20110107134120.000|TR0|don't know about you.

20110107134204.000|20110107134206.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Big story this morning out of 
20110107134206.000|20110107134208.000|TR0|London.  Police stepping up security there 
20110107134208.000|20110107134210.000|TR0|at airports, subway stations following 
20110107134210.000|20110107134213.000|TR0|reports of a possible terror attack.
20110107134213.000|20110107134215.000|TR0|
20110107134215.000|20110107134217.000|TR0|CNN has learned security officials are 
20110107134217.000|20110107134220.000|TR0|concerned about an attack like the 
20110107134220.000|20110107134222.000|TR0|coordinated attacks back in 2008 in 
20110107134222.000|20110107134224.000|TR0|Mumbai.  Terrorists rocked the Indian 
20110107134224.000|20110107134227.000|TR0|capital there you may remember killing 175 
20110107134227.000|20110107134229.000|TR0|people, injuring dozens more.  The British 
20110107134229.000|20110107134231.000|TR0|threat level is now at severe.       
20110107134231.000|20110107134234.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Following a developing story out 
20110107134234.000|20110107134236.000|TR0|of central Michigan, cleaning up 
20110107134236.000|20110107134238.000|TR0|hydrochloric acid that leaked after 11 
20110107134238.000|20110107134241.000|TR0|cars went off the tracks in the derailment 
20110107134241.000|20110107134243.000|TR0|last night.  Dozens of people forced to 
20110107134243.000|20110107134245.000|TR0|leave the homes.  No one was injured.  
20110107134245.000|20110107134247.000|TR0|It's not clear how much hydrochloric acid 
20110107134247.000|20110107134250.000|TR0|is leaking and what impact that might have 
20110107134250.000|20110107134252.000|TR0|on the environment and people living in 
20110107134252.000|20110107134254.000|TR0|that area.

20110107134257.000|20110107134259.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Also, pictures here to show you.  
20110107134259.000|20110107134301.000|TR0|This is out of Texas. Look at this.  
20110107134301.000|20110107134304.000|TR0|Police say the driver of this vehicle.  
20110107134304.000|20110107134306.000|TR0|You can't make the vehicle out hit a hog.  
20110107134306.000|20110107134308.000|TR0|Look at the child there.  The car spun 
20110107134308.000|20110107134311.000|TR0|out, burst into flames.  Another driver 
20110107134311.000|20110107134313.000|TR0|saw it happen and then stopped, got out, 
20110107134313.000|20110107134315.000|TR0|cut the one-year-old from the car seat.  
20110107134315.000|20110107134317.000|TR0|Police say everybody is going to be OK.

20110107134327.000|20110107134329.000|TR0|The northeast is ready for more snow and 
20110107134329.000|20110107134331.000|TR0|the south under an icy threat, as well.  
20110107134331.000|20110107134334.000|TR0|Rob Marciano with the weekend forecast

20110107134343.000|20110107134345.000|TR0|CHETRY:  New York city, light snow, 30 
20110107134345.000|20110107134347.000|TR0|degrees right now.  But it's going to be 
20110107134347.000|20110107134350.000|TR0|getting heavier.  It's 34 degrees and snow 
20110107134350.000|20110107134352.000|TR0|today, could pick up half a foot in some 
20110107134352.000|20110107134354.000|TR0|areas around here.
20110107134354.000|20110107134357.000|TR0|
20110107134357.000|20110107134359.000|TR0|HOLMES:  But our Rob Marciano tells us 
20110107134359.000|20110107134401.000|TR0|even though six inches nothing like what 
20110107134401.000|20110107134404.000|TR0|we saw, Rob, a few weeks ago here with the 
20110107134404.000|20110107134406.000|TR0|big blizzard and has it in the back of 
20110107134406.000|20110107134408.000|TR0|people's minds right now.
20110107134408.000|20110107134411.000|TR0|
20110107134411.000|20110107134413.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  The 
20110107134413.000|20110107134415.000|TR0|thing is, this thing is bigger than that 
20110107134415.000|20110107134417.000|TR0|but it's not as organized, so it's not as 
20110107134417.000|20110107134420.000|TR0|concentrated.  We're not going to see the 
20110107134420.000|20110107134422.000|TR0|wind and the snow measured in feet, 
20110107134422.000|20110107134424.000|TR0|measuring it in a few inches.
20110107134424.000|20110107134427.000|TR0|
20110107134427.000|20110107134429.000|TR0|Here's a center of it.  Obviously, it is 
20110107134429.000|20110107134431.000|TR0|pretty wide circulation affecting a lot of 
20110107134431.000|20110107134434.000|TR0|people back from the Midwest to the 
20110107134434.000|20110107134436.000|TR0|Tennessee valley and swinging up through 
20110107134436.000|20110107134438.000|TR0|the northeast and that where we're seeing 
20110107134438.000|20110107134441.000|TR0|the heavier precipes right now.
20110107134441.000|20110107134443.000|TR0|
20110107134443.000|20110107134445.000|TR0|Philadelphia, you're starting to see it 
20110107134445.000|20110107134448.000|TR0|taper off already heading into central 
20110107134448.000|20110107134450.000|TR0|Jersey and southern Jersey; Atlantic City 
20110107134450.000|20110107134452.000|TR0|about to get some of the snow, as well.  
20110107134452.000|20110107134454.000|TR0|And it's kind of pivoting up into the Big 
20110107134454.000|20110107134457.000|TR0|Apple, where you're starting to see snow 
20110107134457.000|20110107134459.000|TR0|accumulate at least on the sides of the 
20110107134459.000|20110107134501.000|TR0|roads but it's -- it doesn't look to be 
20110107134501.000|20110107134504.000|TR0|terribly organized at this moment.
20110107134504.000|20110107134506.000|TR0|
20110107134506.000|20110107134508.000|TR0|This is what's happened in the past hour 
20110107134508.000|20110107134511.000|TR0|or two.  Let's go forward and show you 
20110107134511.000|20110107134513.000|TR0|what our computer models think is going to 
20110107134513.000|20110107134515.000|TR0|happen as far as where the snow is moving 
20110107134515.000|20110107134518.000|TR0|over the next several hours.  It pivots 
20110107134518.000|20110107134520.000|TR0|through New York City, and gets up into 
20110107134520.000|20110107134522.000|TR0|New England and notice there's not a whole 
20110107134522.000|20110107134524.000|TR0|lot of redevelopment behind it.  Something 
20110107134524.000|20110107134527.000|TR0|a little of the back end of the 
20110107134527.000|20110107134529.000|TR0|disturbance (INAUDIBLE) that come through 
20110107134529.000|20110107134531.000|TR0|later on in the weekend but that's not 
20110107134531.000|20110107134534.000|TR0|really going to amount to a whole lot.
20110107134534.000|20110107134536.000|TR0|
20110107134536.000|20110107134538.000|TR0|So this thing is not going to measure up 
20110107134538.000|20110107134541.000|TR0|certainly into feet.  It might get a few 
20110107134541.000|20110107134543.000|TR0|inches out of it.  That's about it.
20110107134543.000|20110107134545.000|TR0|
20110107134545.000|20110107134548.000|TR0|Winter weather advisories are -- are 
20110107134548.000|20110107134550.000|TR0|posted for the purple area or for the blue 
20110107134550.000|20110107134552.000|TR0|areas and the pinkish purplish hue winter 
20110107134552.000|20110107134554.000|TR0|storm warning, five to ten inches there.
20110107134554.000|20110107134557.000|TR0|
20110107134557.000|20110107134559.000|TR0|But down to the south, that could get a 
20110107134559.000|20110107134601.000|TR0|couple of inches of snow in places like 
20110107134601.000|20110107134604.000|TR0|Knoxville, Tennessee; certainly higher 
20110107134604.000|20110107134606.000|TR0|amounts in the smoky mountains with this 
20110107134606.000|20110107134608.000|TR0|system.  It is slowing down air travel.
20110107134608.000|20110107134611.000|TR0|
20110107134611.000|20110107134613.000|TR0|Travel today on the roadways is going to 
20110107134613.000|20110107134615.000|TR0|be a little bit dicey. On the airways out 
20110107134615.000|20110107134618.000|TR0|of the bigger airports it's going to be a 
20110107134618.000|20110107134620.000|TR0|pain.  We got ground stop now at LaGuardia 
20110107134620.000|20110107134622.000|TR0|until 9:15; Newark, still a ground stop 
20110107134622.000|20110107134625.000|TR0|extended at Philadelphia, as well.
20110107134625.000|20110107134627.000|TR0|
20110107134627.000|20110107134629.000|TR0|And cold air behind this system, 
20110107134629.000|20110107134631.000|TR0|temperatures definitely not above average 
20110107134631.000|20110107134634.000|TR0|and as the system begins to move its way 
20110107134634.000|20110107134636.000|TR0|to the east, the cold air will drive its 
20110107134636.000|20110107134638.000|TR0|way down to the south and that will make 
20110107134638.000|20110107134641.000|TR0|for a whole another slew of problems by 
20110107134641.000|20110107134643.000|TR0|the times we get towards Sunday night into 
20110107134643.000|20110107134645.000|TR0|Monday with the potential of seeing 
20110107134645.000|20110107134648.000|TR0|accumulating ice across parts of Dixie.
20110107134648.000|20110107134650.000|TR0|
20110107134650.000|20110107134652.000|TR0|So enough to make maybe a snowman -- small 
20110107134652.000|20110107134655.000|TR0|one.  You'll get home ok though, just take 
20110107134655.000|20110107134657.000|TR0|it slow guys.  Back up to you in New York.

20110107134706.000|20110107134708.000|TR0|CHETRY:  You can always dig up snow but, 
20110107134708.000|20110107134711.000|TR0|you know, it has to be the right type of 
20110107134711.000|20110107134713.000|TR0|snow to make a good snowman.
20110107134713.000|20110107134715.000|TR0|
20110107134715.000|20110107134718.000|TR0|HOLMES:  What type is that?

20110107134720.000|20110107134722.000|TR0|CHETRY:  It has to be nice and fluffy and 
20110107134722.000|20110107134725.000|TR0|you can just roll it and make it bigger 
20110107134725.000|20110107134727.000|TR0|and bigger and bigger.
20110107134727.000|20110107134729.000|TR0|
20110107134729.000|20110107134731.000|TR0|HOLMES:  I'll take your word for it.
20110107134731.000|20110107134734.000|TR0|
20110107134734.000|20110107134736.000|TR0|CHETRY:  You know I've been busy making a 
20110107134736.000|20110107134738.000|TR0|lot of snow.
20110107134738.000|20110107134741.000|TR0|
20110107134741.000|20110107134743.000|TR0|HOLMES:  I'm from the south.  We don't do 
20110107134743.000|20110107134745.000|TR0|well with snow.
20110107134745.000|20110107134748.000|TR0|
20110107134748.000|20110107134750.000|TR0|CHETRY:  You're right.
20110107134750.000|20110107134752.000|TR0|
20110107134752.000|20110107134755.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Yes.
20110107134755.000|20110107134757.000|TR0|
20110107134757.000|20110107134759.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, speaking of the south, 
20110107134759.000|20110107134801.000|TR0|Arizona.  A very controversial new budget 
20110107134801.000|20110107134804.000|TR0|cutting measure which basically says we 
20110107134804.000|20110107134806.000|TR0|don't have the money to keep people on the 
20110107134806.000|20110107134808.000|TR0|organ transplant list and so we're just 
20110107134808.000|20110107134811.000|TR0|going to have to take them off.
20110107134811.000|20110107134813.000|TR0|
20110107134813.000|20110107134815.000|TR0|Well, a second person in Arizona has now 
20110107134815.000|20110107134818.000|TR0|died waiting after being booted from that 
20110107134818.000|20110107134820.000|TR0|list and they couldn't find a donor.  
20110107134820.000|20110107134822.000|TR0|Well, now, we're talking about a personal 
20110107134822.000|20110107134825.000|TR0|face on this story.
20110107134825.000|20110107134827.000|TR0|
20110107134827.000|20110107134829.000|TR0|Up next, we're going to meet one man who's 
20110107134829.000|20110107134832.000|TR0|been waiting for a heart transplant who 
20110107134832.000|20110107134834.000|TR0|received word, that he too, is dropped 
20110107134834.000|20110107134836.000|TR0|from this list -- coming up.
20110107134836.000|20110107134838.000|TR0|
20110107134838.000|20110107134841.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110107134841.000|20110107134843.000|TR0|
20110107134843.000|20110107134845.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Fifty minutes past the hour right 
20110107134845.000|20110107134848.000|TR0|now.
20110107134848.000|20110107134850.000|TR0|
20110107134850.000|20110107134852.000|TR0|Controversial budget cuts by Arizona 
20110107134852.000|20110107134855.000|TR0|Governor Jan Brewer and the state 
20110107134855.000|20110107134857.000|TR0|legislators there are saving the state 
20110107134857.000|20110107134859.000|TR0|about $1.5 million but many are asking at 
20110107134859.000|20110107134902.000|TR0|what human price.
20110107134902.000|20110107134904.000|TR0|
20110107134904.000|20110107134906.000|TR0|Two people have now died because those 
20110107134906.000|20110107134908.000|TR0|cuts denied them potentially life-saving 
20110107134908.000|20110107134911.000|TR0|organ transplants.  Well now, some state 
20110107134911.000|20110107134913.000|TR0|politicians are talking about passing 
20110107134913.000|20110107134915.000|TR0|perhaps an emergency legislation to 
20110107134915.000|20110107134918.000|TR0|restore the funding before anyone else 
20110107134918.000|20110107134920.000|TR0|dies.

20110107134925.000|20110107134927.000|TR0|those cuts, he's been waiting for a heart 
20110107134927.000|20110107134929.000|TR0|transplant; 36 years old and he has been 
20110107134929.000|20110107134932.000|TR0|dropped from the waiting list.

20110107134934.000|20110107134936.000|TR0|Joining us from Phoenix, Arizona this

20110107134943.000|20110107134945.000|TR0|RANDALL SHEPHERD, DROPPED FROM AZ HEART 
20110107134945.000|20110107134948.000|TR0|TRANSPLANT LIST:  Good morning.  Thank you 
20110107134948.000|20110107134950.000|TR0|for having me.
20110107134950.000|20110107134952.000|TR0|
20110107134952.000|20110107134955.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Tell -- tell us a little bit 
20110107134955.000|20110107134957.000|TR0|about your story.  You -- you I know you 
20110107134957.000|20110107134959.000|TR0|have a condition called cardiomyopathy.  
20110107134959.000|20110107135002.000|TR0|You need a heart transplant, you were on 
20110107135002.000|20110107135004.000|TR0|the list.  And then you were notified was 
20110107135004.000|20110107135006.000|TR0|it last -- this past summer that you were 
20110107135006.000|20110107135009.000|TR0|being dropped.  What happened?
20110107135009.000|20110107135011.000|TR0|
20110107135011.000|20110107135013.000|TR0|SHEPHERD:  That's correct.  Yes, I got the 
20110107135013.000|20110107135015.000|TR0|phone call, as you mentioned, 
20110107135015.000|20110107135018.000|TR0|cardiomyopathy, the official name for it, 
20110107135018.000|20110107135020.000|TR0|from what I have is non-ischemic 
20110107135020.000|20110107135022.000|TR0|cardiomyopathy.  And from what I was told, 
20110107135022.000|20110107135025.000|TR0|the majority of people who have this 
20110107135025.000|20110107135027.000|TR0|condition is due to some form of substance 
20110107135027.000|20110107135029.000|TR0|abuse.  And, you know, people have pretty 
20110107135029.000|20110107135032.000|TR0|much done it to themselves and the state's 
20110107135032.000|20110107135034.000|TR0|decided you know, what -- we don't -- we 
20110107135034.000|20110107135036.000|TR0|don't think that we should be paying for 
20110107135036.000|20110107135039.000|TR0|somebody else's poor decisions.
20110107135039.000|20110107135041.000|TR0|
20110107135041.000|20110107135043.000|TR0|And in my case, it's -- it's a result of 
20110107135043.000|20110107135045.000|TR0|childhood illness but it's left me in a 
20110107135045.000|20110107135048.000|TR0|position where I can't work, I can't do a 
20110107135048.000|20110107135050.000|TR0|lot of things that I -- that I used to be 
20110107135050.000|20110107135052.000|TR0|able to do.  And until I get a new heart, 
20110107135052.000|20110107135055.000|TR0|I'm kind of -- my life is kind of in a 
20110107135055.000|20110107135057.000|TR0|holding pattern.
20110107135057.000|20110107135059.000|TR0|
20110107135059.000|20110107135102.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And your wife, of course, she 
20110107135102.000|20110107135104.000|TR0|works.  You have three children.
20110107135104.000|20110107135106.000|TR0|
20110107135106.000|20110107135109.000|TR0|SHEPHERD:  Yes.
20110107135109.000|20110107135111.000|TR0|
20110107135111.000|20110107135113.000|TR0|CHETRY:  She does not have health 
20110107135113.000|20110107135115.000|TR0|insurance and so you relying -- were 
20110107135115.000|20110107135118.000|TR0|relying on Medicaid.  And what did you 
20110107135118.000|20110107135120.000|TR0|hear from Medicaid or -- or from your -- 
20110107135120.000|20110107135122.000|TR0|the people who are helping you there about 
20110107135122.000|20110107135125.000|TR0|why you're now removed from this waiting 
20110107135125.000|20110107135127.000|TR0|list to get a new heart?
20110107135127.000|20110107135129.000|TR0|
20110107135129.000|20110107135132.000|TR0|SHEPHERD:  Yes.  Well, I received word -- 
20110107135132.000|20110107135134.000|TR0|about a year after I was placed on the 
20110107135134.000|20110107135136.000|TR0|transplant list -- I received word that 
20110107135136.000|20110107135139.000|TR0|these cuts were on the horizon.  There was 
20110107135139.000|20110107135141.000|TR0|a chance that this was going to happen 
20110107135141.000|20110107135143.000|TR0|from my nurse coordinator and she said 
20110107135143.000|20110107135145.000|TR0|contact your state legislators, contact 
20110107135145.000|20110107135148.000|TR0|everybody you can.  We're working on our 
20110107135148.000|20110107135150.000|TR0|end to get the word out.
20110107135150.000|20110107135152.000|TR0|
20110107135152.000|20110107135155.000|TR0|And then as of October 1st I got the 
20110107135155.000|20110107135157.000|TR0|official call that, you know, I'm 
20110107135157.000|20110107135159.000|TR0|officially on the -- on the inactive list. 
20110107135159.000|20110107135202.000|TR0| And until -- until either funding becomes 
20110107135202.000|20110107135204.000|TR0|-- made available or I'm able to raised 
20110107135204.000|20110107135206.000|TR0|the funding myself, there's -- it's not 
20110107135206.000|20110107135209.000|TR0|going to -- I'm not going to get my heart 
20110107135209.000|20110107135211.000|TR0|until then.
20110107135211.000|20110107135213.000|TR0|
20110107135213.000|20110107135216.000|TR0|CHETRY:  I mean, how do you feel hearing 
20110107135216.000|20110107135218.000|TR0|that and also knowing as we said that -- 
20110107135218.000|20110107135220.000|TR0|that two other people who were waiting for 
20110107135220.000|20110107135222.000|TR0|donated organs and were dropped from the 
20110107135222.000|20110107135225.000|TR0|list have now passed away?
20110107135225.000|20110107135227.000|TR0|
20110107135227.000|20110107135229.000|TR0|SHEPHERD:  I mean it's a shock to me.  You 
20110107135229.000|20110107135232.000|TR0|know, I know -- I know this -- this last 
20110107135232.000|20110107135234.000|TR0|case, I haven't been able to find out who 
20110107135234.000|20110107135236.000|TR0|it was but I've met a number of people, a 
20110107135236.000|20110107135239.000|TR0|number of these people who were in the 
20110107135239.000|20110107135241.000|TR0|same boat I am, become familiar with them. 
20110107135241.000|20110107135243.000|TR0| We've interacted through a different -- 
20110107135243.000|20110107135246.000|TR0|different media events, several press 
20110107135246.000|20110107135248.000|TR0|conferences and -- and just interviews and 
20110107135248.000|20110107135250.000|TR0|so I don't know who it is, who -- who just 
20110107135250.000|20110107135252.000|TR0|passed away.  It might be somebody that I 
20110107135252.000|20110107135255.000|TR0|was actually -- that I've actually become 
20110107135255.000|20110107135257.000|TR0|familiar with.
20110107135257.000|20110107135259.000|TR0|
20110107135259.000|20110107135302.000|TR0|So thinking of that, you know, there's -- 
20110107135302.000|20110107135304.000|TR0|there's a bit of a personal loss and 
20110107135304.000|20110107135306.000|TR0|there's also the realization that you know 
20110107135306.000|20110107135309.000|TR0|this -- this could very well be me in time 
20110107135309.000|20110107135311.000|TR0|if -- if something's not changed here.
20110107135311.000|20110107135313.000|TR0|
20110107135313.000|20110107135316.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And it must be a tough 
20110107135316.000|20110107135318.000|TR0|conversation.  I know you have two young 
20110107135318.000|20110107135320.000|TR0|girls, 13 and 9.  You have a 4-year-old 
20110107135320.000|20110107135322.000|TR0|son, as well.  I mean, did they -- how -- 
20110107135322.000|20110107135325.000|TR0|how much do they know about how, you know, 
20110107135325.000|20110107135327.000|TR0|potentially deadly your condition is?
20110107135327.000|20110107135329.000|TR0|
20110107135329.000|20110107135332.000|TR0|SHEPHERD:  Well, they know dad's sick and 
20110107135332.000|20110107135334.000|TR0|dad needs a heart. They don't -- I -- I 
20110107135334.000|20110107135336.000|TR0|mean, my wife and I want them to have as 
20110107135336.000|20110107135339.000|TR0|normal a childhood as they can.  We don't 
20110107135339.000|20110107135341.000|TR0|want them involved in the politics of it 
20110107135341.000|20110107135343.000|TR0|or we don't them thinking at any moment we 
20110107135343.000|20110107135346.000|TR0|could come home and dad won't be there.
20110107135346.000|20110107135348.000|TR0|
20110107135348.000|20110107135350.000|TR0|So as far as they know, yes, dad's sick 
20110107135350.000|20110107135352.000|TR0|and dad can't work but, you know, we -- we 
20110107135352.000|20110107135355.000|TR0|assure them every day that we're doing 
20110107135355.000|20110107135357.000|TR0|everything that we can to -- to get better 
20110107135357.000|20110107135359.000|TR0|and get over this, and get life back to 
20110107135359.000|20110107135402.000|TR0|normal as soon as possible.
20110107135402.000|20110107135404.000|TR0|
20110107135404.000|20110107135406.000|TR0|CHETRY:  You know, I mean, the argument 
20110107135406.000|20110107135409.000|TR0|from the other side, is look this is a 
20110107135409.000|20110107135411.000|TR0|state that's facing a $1 billion budget 
20110107135411.000|20110107135413.000|TR0|shortfall. They don't have -- the ability 
20110107135413.000|20110107135416.000|TR0|to pay for things anymore and they are 
20110107135416.000|20110107135418.000|TR0|trying to figure out where to cut.
20110107135418.000|20110107135420.000|TR0|
20110107135420.000|20110107135423.000|TR0|I mean, what do you -- what do you say 
20110107135423.000|20110107135425.000|TR0|when you hear we just don't have the money 
20110107135425.000|20110107135427.000|TR0|in the state to continue these programs?
20110107135427.000|20110107135429.000|TR0|
20110107135429.000|20110107135432.000|TR0|SHEPHERD:  Well it's -- it's obvious if -- 
20110107135432.000|20110107135434.000|TR0|if the state's broke, it's broke.  And -- 
20110107135434.000|20110107135436.000|TR0|and you know, I -- I can -- excuse me, I 
20110107135436.000|20110107135439.000|TR0|can kick and scream all I want and if 
20110107135439.000|20110107135441.000|TR0|there's no money for a transplant, then 
20110107135441.000|20110107135443.000|TR0|it's just not going to happen.     You 
20110107135443.000|20110107135446.000|TR0|know, I think there's a lot of areas where 
20110107135446.000|20110107135448.000|TR0|cutbacks could be made before they get to 
20110107135448.000|20110107135450.000|TR0|the transplant cuts, before things that 
20110107135450.000|20110107135453.000|TR0|are actually affecting people's -- in a 
20110107135453.000|20110107135455.000|TR0|life and death situation.
20110107135455.000|20110107135457.000|TR0|
20110107135457.000|20110107135459.000|TR0|You know, and I -- I really feel bad for 
20110107135459.000|20110107135502.000|TR0|the governor and for the legislators, 
20110107135502.000|20110107135504.000|TR0|those who had to make this decision and I 
20110107135504.000|20110107135506.000|TR0|certainly wouldn't want to be in their 
20110107135506.000|20110107135509.000|TR0|shoes and I wouldn't want to be the one 
20110107135509.000|20110107135511.000|TR0|making the call that results in somebody 
20110107135511.000|20110107135513.000|TR0|else living or dying.
20110107135513.000|20110107135516.000|TR0|
20110107135516.000|20110107135518.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Absolutely.  Well, there is some 
20110107135518.000|20110107135520.000|TR0|hope on the horizon.  I understand that 
20110107135520.000|20110107135523.000|TR0|they are looking to perhaps pass some 
20110107135523.000|20110107135525.000|TR0|emergency legislation that would fund that 
20110107135525.000|20110107135527.000|TR0|program again, and get you and others 
20110107135527.000|20110107135529.000|TR0|waiting back on the list.
20110107135529.000|20110107135532.000|TR0|
20110107135532.000|20110107135534.000|TR0|Also, as you talked about, if that doesn't 
20110107135534.000|20110107135536.000|TR0|happen, you have to raise the money 
20110107135536.000|20110107135539.000|TR0|yourself to at least cover the gap between 
20110107135539.000|20110107135541.000|TR0|what Medicaid pays and not, $120,000.  You 
20110107135541.000|20110107135543.000|TR0|say that somebody started a Facebook page 
20110107135543.000|20110107135546.000|TR0|and you've raised about half of that right 
20110107135546.000|20110107135548.000|TR0|now.
20110107135548.000|20110107135550.000|TR0|
20110107135550.000|20110107135553.000|TR0|Shepherd:  That's correct.  We've -- a lot 
20110107135553.000|20110107135555.000|TR0|of what we have raised has been through 
20110107135555.000|20110107135557.000|TR0|media attention and we've -- I've got a 
20110107135557.000|20110107135600.000|TR0|Web site on -- it's called ntafund.org.  
20110107135600.000|20110107135602.000|TR0|And it's the National Transplant 
20110107135602.000|20110107135604.000|TR0|Assistance.  They're active in raising 
20110107135604.000|20110107135606.000|TR0|money for transplants across the country, 
20110107135606.000|20110107135609.000|TR0|different people who need any kind of 
20110107135609.000|20110107135611.000|TR0|whether it's bone marrow or organ 
20110107135611.000|20110107135613.000|TR0|transplants or even somebody, catastrophic 
20110107135613.000|20110107135616.000|TR0|injury.
20110107135616.000|20110107135618.000|TR0|
20110107135618.000|20110107135620.000|TR0|People can go there, look up my name or 
20110107135620.000|20110107135623.000|TR0|any name of somebody who might be in the 
20110107135623.000|20110107135625.000|TR0|same boat and donate to me or to anybody 
20110107135625.000|20110107135627.000|TR0|and it is tax deductible.  And like you 
20110107135627.000|20110107135630.000|TR0|said, we're about halfway there to what we 
20110107135630.000|20110107135632.000|TR0|need to raise.
20110107135632.000|20110107135634.000|TR0|
20110107135634.000|20110107135636.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, hopefully you'll get it.  
20110107135636.000|20110107135639.000|TR0|We're also putting up that information for 
20110107135639.000|20110107135641.000|TR0|people.  Randall Shepherd thanks so much 
20110107135641.000|20110107135643.000|TR0|for sharing your story.  We wish you the 
20110107135643.000|20110107135646.000|TR0|best and we hope that all of this can be 
20110107135646.000|20110107135648.000|TR0|rectified in time for you to get better.
20110107135648.000|20110107135650.000|TR0|
20110107135650.000|20110107135653.000|TR0|Thanks so much for joining us this morning.
20110107135653.000|20110107135655.000|TR0|
20110107135655.000|20110107135657.000|TR0|SHEPHERD:  Thank you very much.
20110107135657.000|20110107135700.000|TR0|
20110107135700.000|20110107135702.000|TR0|CHETRY:  By the way, again, the Web site 
20110107135702.000|20110107135704.000|TR0|that we were talking about ntafund.org and 
20110107135704.000|20110107135706.000|TR0|you can type in Randall's name.  It's 
20110107135706.000|20110107135709.000|TR0|Randall Shepherd.  Again, you'll be 
20110107135709.000|20110107135711.000|TR0|directed to a page where if you'd like to 
20110107135711.000|20110107135713.000|TR0|you can help him out.
20110107135713.000|20110107135716.000|TR0|
20110107135716.000|20110107135718.000|TR0|We're going to take a quick break.  
20110107135718.000|20110107135720.000|TR0|Fifty-six minutes past the hour.
20110107135720.000|20110107135723.000|TR0|
20110107135723.000|20110107135725.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110107135725.000|20110107135727.000|TR0|
20110107135727.000|20110107135730.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Say "Hi" Kate.  We're going to 
20110107135730.000|20110107135732.000|TR0|miss Kate.  She is -- she's going to 
20110107135732.000|20110107135734.000|TR0|greener pastures.  She's going to Piers 
20110107135734.000|20110107135736.000|TR0|Morgan.  But she's still going to be in 
20110107135736.000|20110107135739.000|TR0|the building.
20110107135739.000|20110107135741.000|TR0|
20110107135741.000|20110107135743.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Is she really?
20110107135743.000|20110107135746.000|TR0|
20110107135746.000|20110107135748.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.  Different shift; she'll get 
20110107135748.000|20110107135750.000|TR0|a little bit more sleep but we'll still 
20110107135750.000|20110107135753.000|TR0|see her.
20110107135753.000|20110107135755.000|TR0|
20110107135755.000|20110107135757.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Wow.  I show up, she takes off.
20110107135757.000|20110107135800.000|TR0|
20110107135800.000|20110107135802.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes, well, she heard you were 
20110107135802.000|20110107135804.000|TR0|coming to town --
20110107135804.000|20110107135807.000|TR0|
20110107135807.000|20110107135809.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Anymore defections?  Any of you 
20110107135809.000|20110107135811.000|TR0|want (INAUDIBLE).
20110107135811.000|20110107135813.000|TR0|
20110107135813.000|20110107135816.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, this is for the guys out 
20110107135816.000|20110107135818.000|TR0|there.  You didn't need a scientific study 
20110107135818.000|20110107135820.000|TR0|to tell you, you did not like to see girls 
20110107135820.000|20110107135823.000|TR0|cry.
20110107135823.000|20110107135825.000|TR0|
20110107135825.000|20110107135827.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Oh, this is great.  No guy needs 
20110107135827.000|20110107135830.000|TR0|this.  No guy needs this.
20110107135830.000|20110107135832.000|TR0|
20110107135832.000|20110107135834.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well now, the scientists say that 
20110107135834.000|20110107135837.000|TR0|they can figure out why.  Researchers in 
20110107135837.000|20110107135839.000|TR0|Israel found that a woman's tears of 
20110107135839.000|20110107135841.000|TR0|sadness are actually a turnoff. They send 
20110107135841.000|20110107135843.000|TR0|a chemical signal that temporarily lowers 
20110107135843.000|20110107135846.000|TR0|a man's testosterone.  Read between the 
20110107135846.000|20110107135848.000|TR0|lines.
20110107135848.000|20110107135850.000|TR0|
20110107135850.000|20110107135853.000|TR0|Researchers don't know if the same is true 
20110107135853.000|20110107135855.000|TR0|with a man's tears because they say hey, 
20110107135855.000|20110107135857.000|TR0|it's harder to find a guy to cry in the 
20110107135857.000|20110107135900.000|TR0|lab for us.
20110107135900.000|20110107135902.000|TR0|
20110107135902.000|20110107135904.000|TR0|HOLMES:  But they say the guy has to be in 
20110107135904.000|20110107135907.000|TR0|close proximity to the tears they're 
20110107135907.000|20110107135909.000|TR0|talking about here.  We don't care.  She 
20110107135909.000|20110107135911.000|TR0|can be across the room, she could be on 
20110107135911.000|20110107135913.000|TR0|TV.  If a woman's crying, a man is not 
20110107135913.000|20110107135916.000|TR0|going to -- he's not going to enjoy it.

20110107135918.000|20110107135920.000|TR0|CHETRY:  My daughter has figured that out 
20110107135920.000|20110107135923.000|TR0|pretty early. Gets whatever she wants from 
20110107135923.000|20110107135925.000|TR0|daddy.

20110107135927.000|20110107135930.000|TR0|HOLMES:  We certainly don't want to be the 
20110107135930.000|20110107135932.000|TR0|ones, Kyra Phillips, to make the woman cry 
20110107135932.000|20110107135934.000|TR0|either, even though sometimes we fail at 
20110107135934.000|20110107135937.000|TR0|that.
20110107135937.000|20110107135939.000|TR0|
20110107135939.000|20110107135941.000|TR0|Here's Kyra down in Atlanta.
