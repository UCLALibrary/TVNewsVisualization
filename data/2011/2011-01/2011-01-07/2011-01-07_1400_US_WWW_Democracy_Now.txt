20110107140028.104|20110107140029.725|TR0|The Congressional Budget Office 
20110107140029.725|20110107140031.346|TR0|is estimating that the federal 
20110107140031.346|20110107140032.967|TR0|deficit would increase by $230 
20110107140032.967|20110107140034.588|TR0|billion over the next decade if

20110107140039.451|20110107140041.072|TR0|found that repeal would leave 32

20110107140442.597|20110107140444.218|TR0|has unveiled a five-year plan 
20110107140444.218|20110107140445.839|TR0|that would trim about $78 
20110107140445.839|20110107140447.460|TR0|billion from anticipated 
20110107140447.460|20110107140449.081|TR0|spending in the Pentagon budget. 
20110107140449.081|20110107140450.702|TR0|Despite the proposed cuts,

20110107140458.807|20110107140500.428|TR0|in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 
20110107140500.428|20110107140502.049|TR0|the past decade, the Pentagon 
20110107140502.049|20110107140503.670|TR0|budget has risen 65 percent when 
20110107140503.670|20110107140505.291|TR0|adjusted for inflation. Robert 
20110107140505.291|20110107140506.912|TR0|Gates outlined his plan on

20110107140510.154|20110107140511.775|TR0|Robert Gates: "More than $6 
20110107140511.775|20110107140513.396|TR0|billion was saved by our 
20110107140513.396|20110107140515.017|TR0|decision to reduce the size of 
20110107140515.017|20110107140516.638|TR0|the active Army and Marine Corps 
20110107140516.638|20110107140518.259|TR0|starting in FY 2015. Under this 
20110107140518.259|20110107140519.880|TR0|plan, the U.S. Army's permanent 
20110107140519.880|20110107140521.501|TR0|active-duty end strength would 
20110107140521.501|20110107140523.122|TR0|decline by 27,000 troops, while 
20110107140523.122|20110107140524.743|TR0|the Marine Corps would decline 
20110107140524.743|20110107140526.364|TR0|by somewhere between 15,000 and 
20110107140526.364|20110107140527.985|TR0|20,000, depending on the outcome 
20110107140527.985|20110107140529.606|TR0|of their force structure review. 
20110107140529.606|20110107140531.227|TR0|These projected reductions are 
20110107140531.227|20110107140532.848|TR0|based on an assumption that 
20110107140532.848|20110107140534.469|TR0|America's ground combat 
20110107140534.469|20110107140536.090|TR0|commitment in Afghanistan would

20110107141326.172|20110107141327.793|TR0|nation and for the world. You 
20110107141327.793|20110107141329.414|TR0|have also shown, through your 
20110107141329.414|20110107141331.035|TR0|example, that public service is 
20110107141331.035|20110107141332.656|TR0|an honorable calling, and I am 
20110107141332.656|20110107141334.277|TR0|pleased to answer your call.

20110107141335.898|20110107141337.519|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Daley replaces 
20110107141337.519|20110107141339.140|TR0|Rahm Emanuel, who resigned last 
20110107141339.140|20110107141340.761|TR0|year to run for mayor of 
20110107141340.761|20110107141342.382|TR0|Chicago. Daley himself is the 
20110107141342.382|20110107141344.003|TR0|brother of Chicago's current 
20110107141344.003|20110107141345.624|TR0|mayor, Richard Daley. The news 
20110107141345.624|20110107141347.245|TR0|media has widely described the 
20110107141347.245|20110107141348.866|TR0|appointment as an attempt to 
20110107141348.866|20110107141350.487|TR0|mend Obama's supposed frayed 
20110107141350.487|20110107141352.108|TR0|ties to Wall Street. Bill Daley 
20110107141352.108|20110107141353.729|TR0|served as commerce secretary 
20110107141353.729|20110107141355.350|TR0|under President Clinton and 
20110107141355.350|20110107141356.971|TR0|played a key role in 
20110107141356.971|20110107141358.592|TR0|orchestrating the North American 
20110107141358.592|20110107141400.213|TR0|Free Trade Agreement. He's the 
20110107141400.213|20110107141401.834|TR0|Midwest chair of JPMorgan Chase, 
20110107141401.834|20110107141403.455|TR0|a board member of the 
20110107141403.455|20110107141405.076|TR0|pharmaceutical giant Merck, and 
20110107141405.076|20110107141406.697|TR0|former head of 
20110107141406.697|20110107141408.318|TR0|telecommunications giant SBC, 
20110107141408.318|20110107141409.939|TR0|where he lobbied heavily for 
20110107141409.939|20110107141411.560|TR0|deregulation of the phone 
20110107141411.560|20110107141413.181|TR0|industry.

20110107141414.802|20110107141416.423|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Daley's 
20110107141416.423|20110107141418.044|TR0|appointment has raised eyebrows, 
20110107141418.044|20110107141419.665|TR0|in part over his apparent 
20110107141419.665|20110107141421.286|TR0|opposition to two of President 
20110107141421.286|20110107141422.907|TR0|Obama's biggest domestic 
20110107141422.907|20110107141424.527|TR0|initiatives so far. As a 
20110107141424.527|20110107141426.148|TR0|JPMorgan executive, Daley 
20110107141426.148|20110107141427.769|TR0|rejected the administration's 
20110107141427.769|20110107141429.390|TR0|request to publicly support 
20110107141429.390|20110107141431.011|TR0|establishing the Consumer 
20110107141431.011|20110107141432.632|TR0|Financial Protection Agency in 
20110107141432.632|20110107141434.253|TR0|the overhaul of financial 
20110107141434.253|20110107141435.874|TR0|regulation. And in an interview 
20110107141435.874|20110107141437.495|TR0|with the New York Times last 
20110107141437.495|20110107141439.116|TR0|year, Daley criticized the 
20110107141439.116|20110107141440.737|TR0|administration's top domestic 
20110107141440.737|20110107141442.358|TR0|policy achievement: healthcare 
20110107141442.358|20110107141443.979|TR0|reform. Daley said, quote, "They 
20110107141443.979|20110107141445.600|TR0|miscalculated on health care. 
20110107141445.600|20110107141447.221|TR0|The election of '08 sent a 
20110107141447.221|20110107141448.842|TR0|message that after 30 years of 
20110107141448.842|20110107141450.463|TR0|center-right governing, we had 
20110107141450.463|20110107141452.084|TR0|moved to center left - not 
20110107141452.084|20110107141453.705|TR0|left.""
20110107141453.705|20110107141455.326|TR0|
20110107141455.326|20110107141456.947|TR0|In another move expected to 
20110107141456.947|20110107141458.568|TR0|please Wall Street, President 
20110107141458.568|20110107141500.189|TR0|Obama today will reportedly name 
20110107141500.189|20110107141501.810|TR0|Gene Sperling to head the 
20110107141501.810|20110107141503.431|TR0|National Economic Council, 
20110107141503.431|20110107141505.052|TR0|replacing Lawrence Summers. 
20110107141505.052|20110107141506.673|TR0|Sperling served in the same post 
20110107141506.673|20110107141508.294|TR0|under President Bill Clinton. In 
20110107141508.294|20110107141509.915|TR0|2008, he earned nearly $900,000 
20110107141509.915|20110107141511.536|TR0|at Goldman Sachs and an 
20110107141511.536|20110107141513.157|TR0|additional $158,000 in speaking 
20110107141513.157|20110107141514.778|TR0|fees.

20110107141516.399|20110107141518.020|TR0|Well, for more, we're joined now

20110107141534.229|20110107141535.850|TR0|Well, talk first about William 
20110107141535.850|20110107141537.471|TR0|Daley.
20110107141537.471|20110107141539.092|TR0|
20110107141539.092|20110107141540.713|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Well, thanks for 
20110107141540.713|20110107141542.334|TR0|having me.
20110107141542.334|20110107141543.955|TR0|
20110107141543.955|20110107141545.576|TR0|Well, he's certainly, as you 
20110107141545.576|20110107141547.197|TR0|guys mention in your intro, the 
20110107141547.197|20110107141548.818|TR0|candidate of the corporate and 
20110107141548.818|20110107141550.439|TR0|political establishment - deep 
20110107141550.439|20110107141552.060|TR0|ties to the business industry, 
20110107141552.060|20110107141553.681|TR0|not only working for JPMorgan, 
20110107141553.681|20110107141555.302|TR0|but also serving on the boards 
20110107141555.302|20110107141556.923|TR0|of companies like Boeing, Merck, 
20110107141556.923|20110107141558.544|TR0|Abbott Labs, so deep ties there. 
20110107141558.544|20110107141600.165|TR0|A big political insider, working 
20110107141600.165|20110107141601.786|TR0|as a fixer for President 
20110107141601.786|20110107141603.407|TR0|Clinton, commerce secretary, 
20110107141603.407|20110107141605.028|TR0|pushing NAFTA, working for Al 
20110107141605.028|20110107141606.649|TR0|Gore's campaign in 2000 again. 
20110107141606.649|20110107141608.270|TR0|And then deep ties to the 
20110107141608.270|20110107141609.891|TR0|Chicago world, which Obama also 
20110107141609.891|20110107141611.512|TR0|knows very well, as the brother 
20110107141611.512|20110107141613.133|TR0|of outgoing mayor Richard Daley. 
20110107141613.133|20110107141614.754|TR0|So he brings all those different 
20110107141614.754|20110107141616.375|TR0|experiences, which I imagine - I 
20110107141616.375|20110107141617.996|TR0|guess, the combination of which 
20110107141617.996|20110107141619.617|TR0|Obama really wanted in his White 
20110107141619.617|20110107141621.238|TR0|House going forward. But it does 
20110107141621.238|20110107141622.859|TR0|feel like the Clinton era now is 
20110107141622.859|20110107141624.480|TR0|back with a vengeance, and 
20110107141624.480|20110107141626.101|TR0|perhaps not in the best way.
20110107141626.101|20110107141627.722|TR0|
20110107141627.722|20110107141629.343|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, to no 
20110107141629.343|20110107141630.964|TR0|surprise, the U.S. Chamber of 
20110107141630.964|20110107141632.585|TR0|Commerce immediately praised 
20110107141632.585|20110107141634.205|TR0|this appointment of Daley's -
20110107141634.205|20110107141635.826|TR0|
20110107141635.826|20110107141637.447|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Yeah.
20110107141637.447|20110107141639.068|TR0|
20110107141639.068|20110107141640.689|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: - despite the 
20110107141640.689|20110107141642.310|TR0|fact the Chamber has been 
20110107141642.310|20110107141643.931|TR0|battling the Obama 
20110107141643.931|20110107141645.552|TR0|administration almost from the 
20110107141645.552|20110107141647.173|TR0|beginning.
20110107141647.173|20110107141648.794|TR0|
20110107141648.794|20110107141650.415|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Well, it was a 
20110107141650.415|20110107141652.036|TR0|little surreal to see not only 
20110107141652.036|20110107141653.657|TR0|the Chamber, but also Karl Rove, 
20110107141653.657|20110107141655.278|TR0|praise Obama's pick for chief of 
20110107141655.278|20110107141656.899|TR0|staff. But I think this is 
20110107141656.899|20110107141658.520|TR0|exactly what the Obama 
20110107141658.520|20110107141700.141|TR0|administration wanted. As you 
20110107141700.141|20110107141701.762|TR0|say, there seems to be a belief 
20110107141701.762|20110107141703.383|TR0|- I think somewhat of a surreal 
20110107141703.383|20110107141705.004|TR0|one - that the banks are an 
20110107141705.004|20110107141706.625|TR0|underrepresented constituency in 
20110107141706.625|20110107141708.246|TR0|Washington nowadays and that the 
20110107141708.246|20110107141709.867|TR0|way that they have to appease 
20110107141709.867|20110107141711.488|TR0|people like the Chamber is to 
20110107141711.488|20110107141713.109|TR0|bring in someone who they like 
20110107141713.109|20110107141714.730|TR0|and who actually advised them. 
20110107141714.730|20110107141716.351|TR0|As you mentioned earlier, he 
20110107141716.351|20110107141717.972|TR0|advised the Chamber on financial 
20110107141717.972|20110107141719.593|TR0|deregulation before the economic 
20110107141719.593|20110107141721.214|TR0|crisis, and once the economic 
20110107141721.214|20110107141722.835|TR0|crisis happened, he actually 
20110107141722.835|20110107141724.456|TR0|pushed to gut the Consumer 
20110107141724.456|20110107141726.077|TR0|Financial Protection Agency. My 
20110107141726.077|20110107141727.698|TR0|feeling is more is going to come 
20110107141727.698|20110107141729.319|TR0|out about Daley's work for the 
20110107141729.319|20110107141730.940|TR0|Chamber and some of these other 
20110107141730.940|20110107141732.561|TR0|groups in what exactly he did in 
20110107141732.561|20110107141734.182|TR0|terms of lobbying. But I think 
20110107141734.182|20110107141735.803|TR0|the signs that it sent, which 
20110107141735.803|20110107141737.424|TR0|are going to be unsettling to 
20110107141737.424|20110107141739.044|TR0|listeners of this program and 
20110107141739.044|20110107141740.665|TR0|viewers of this program, is the 
20110107141740.665|20110107141742.286|TR0|exact things that Obama will 
20110107141742.286|20110107141743.907|TR0|like about the appointment.
20110107141743.907|20110107141745.528|TR0|
20110107141745.528|20110107141747.149|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Now, what does 
20110107141747.149|20110107141748.770|TR0|this mean in terms of potential 
20110107141748.770|20110107141750.391|TR0|conflicts of stuff that crosses 
20110107141750.391|20110107141752.012|TR0|his desk?
20110107141752.012|20110107141753.633|TR0|
20110107141753.633|20110107141755.254|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Yeah.
20110107141755.254|20110107141756.875|TR0|
20110107141756.875|20110107141758.496|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: I mean, what 
20110107141758.496|20110107141800.117|TR0|will he have to recuse himself 
20110107141800.117|20110107141801.738|TR0|from, in terms of his new post?
20110107141801.738|20110107141803.359|TR0|
20110107141803.359|20110107141804.980|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Well, 
20110107141804.980|20110107141806.601|TR0|theoretically, a lot. I mean, 
20110107141806.601|20110107141808.222|TR0|JPMorgan is a huge company with 
20110107141808.222|20110107141809.843|TR0|all sorts of issues before the 
20110107141809.843|20110107141811.464|TR0|federal government; Boeing; 
20110107141811.464|20110107141813.085|TR0|obviously, when it comes to 
20110107141813.085|20110107141814.706|TR0|Merck and Abbott Labs, I mean, 
20110107141814.706|20110107141816.327|TR0|the whole healthcare bill. So, 
20110107141816.327|20110107141817.948|TR0|it'll be very interesting. I 
20110107141817.948|20110107141819.569|TR0|mean, as chief of staff, he is 
20110107141819.569|20110107141821.190|TR0|the main gatekeeper now for the 
20110107141821.190|20110107141822.811|TR0|Obama White House, and he has 
20110107141822.811|20110107141824.432|TR0|all manner of corporate 
20110107141824.432|20110107141826.053|TR0|relationships. It's going to be 
20110107141826.053|20110107141827.674|TR0|very delicate for him to manage 
20110107141827.674|20110107141829.295|TR0|that. We won't really know, 
20110107141829.295|20110107141830.916|TR0|honestly, in a lot of cases - is 
20110107141830.916|20110107141832.537|TR0|he recusing himself? What's 
20110107141832.537|20110107141834.158|TR0|going on? It's not exactly like 
20110107141834.158|20110107141835.779|TR0|there's a clear watchdog for the 
20110107141835.779|20110107141837.400|TR0|chief of staff. So, this is 
20110107141837.400|20110107141839.021|TR0|something that people are going 
20110107141839.021|20110107141840.642|TR0|to have to focus on very closely 
20110107141840.642|20110107141842.263|TR0|going forward.
20110107141842.263|20110107141843.883|TR0|
20110107141843.883|20110107141845.504|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You quote 
20110107141845.504|20110107141847.125|TR0|AFL-CIO former head, John 
20110107141847.125|20110107141848.746|TR0|Sweeney, once saying that Daley 
20110107141848.746|20110107141850.367|TR0|stood "squarely on the opposite 
20110107141850.367|20110107141851.988|TR0|side of working families."
20110107141851.988|20110107141853.609|TR0|
20110107141853.609|20110107141855.230|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Yeah, and that 
20110107141855.230|20110107141856.851|TR0|was in response to Daley pushing 
20110107141856.851|20110107141858.472|TR0|hard to normalize trade 
20110107141858.472|20110107141900.093|TR0|relations with China, in a 
20110107141900.093|20110107141901.714|TR0|similar way that he had pushed 
20110107141901.714|20110107141903.335|TR0|very hard to pass NAFTA. He was 
20110107141903.335|20110107141904.956|TR0|the main architect of NAFTA. And 
20110107141904.956|20110107141906.577|TR0|Al Gore basically gave him all 
20110107141906.577|20110107141908.198|TR0|the credit for pushing NAFTA and 
20110107141908.198|20110107141909.819|TR0|then for pushing China.
20110107141909.819|20110107141911.440|TR0|
20110107141911.440|20110107141913.061|TR0|It was interesting, the AFL - 
20110107141913.061|20110107141914.682|TR0|new AFL-CIO head, Rich Trumka, 
20110107141914.682|20110107141916.303|TR0|put out a very tepid statement 
20110107141916.303|20110107141917.924|TR0|about Daley yesterday. And I 
20110107141917.924|20110107141919.545|TR0|talked to Trumka, actually, 
20110107141919.545|20110107141921.166|TR0|yesterday afternoon. I said, "Do 
20110107141921.166|20110107141922.787|TR0|you want to elaborate?" And he 
20110107141922.787|20110107141924.408|TR0|said, "No." But it's clear that 
20110107141924.408|20110107141926.029|TR0|they're watching this with some 
20110107141926.029|20110107141927.650|TR0|trepidation, wondering what he's 
20110107141927.650|20110107141929.271|TR0|going to do, what policies he's 
20110107141929.271|20110107141930.892|TR0|going to push. As you remember, 
20110107141930.892|20110107141932.513|TR0|I mean, the Obama administration 
20110107141932.513|20110107141934.134|TR0|now is pushing hard on the 
20110107141934.134|20110107141935.755|TR0|deficit. People are wondering 
20110107141935.755|20110107141937.376|TR0|what's going to be the policy 
20110107141937.376|20110107141938.997|TR0|for year three. Will they touch 
20110107141938.997|20110107141940.618|TR0|issues like Social Security, 
20110107141940.618|20110107141942.239|TR0|like Medicare? And that's the 
20110107141942.239|20110107141943.860|TR0|worry about Daley. I mean, he 
20110107141943.860|20110107141945.481|TR0|served on the board of another 
20110107141945.481|20110107141947.102|TR0|group, Third Way, the very 
20110107141947.102|20110107141948.722|TR0|pro-corporate, centrist 
20110107141948.722|20110107141950.343|TR0|Democratic group. And one of the 
20110107141950.343|20110107141951.964|TR0|things that they praised him for 
20110107141951.964|20110107141953.585|TR0|was his work on, quote, 
20110107141953.585|20110107141955.206|TR0|"reforming entitlements," which 
20110107141955.206|20110107141956.827|TR0|sounds to a lot of people now 
20110107141956.827|20110107141958.448|TR0|like code words for gutting 
20110107141958.448|20110107142000.069|TR0|Medicare and Social Security. 
20110107142000.069|20110107142001.690|TR0|So, people are watching this 
20110107142001.690|20110107142003.311|TR0|closely and wondering what's 
20110107142003.311|20110107142004.932|TR0|going to happen as a result of 
20110107142004.932|20110107142006.553|TR0|Daley being in there.
20110107142006.553|20110107142008.174|TR0|
20110107142008.174|20110107142009.795|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And what about 
20110107142009.795|20110107142011.416|TR0|Gene Sperling? Because, 
20110107142011.416|20110107142013.037|TR0|obviously, JPMorgan Chase  --  
20110107142013.037|20110107142014.658|TR0|Goldman Sachs was worried that 
20110107142014.658|20110107142016.279|TR0|JPMorgan Chase would have an 
20110107142016.279|20110107142017.900|TR0|inside track  --
20110107142017.900|20110107142019.521|TR0|
20110107142019.521|20110107142021.142|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Yeah.
20110107142021.142|20110107142022.763|TR0|
20110107142022.763|20110107142024.384|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: - with Daley, 
20110107142024.384|20110107142026.005|TR0|so now he names to Gene 
20110107142026.005|20110107142027.626|TR0|Sperling, formerly of Goldman 
20110107142027.626|20110107142029.247|TR0|Sachs.
20110107142029.247|20110107142030.868|TR0|
20110107142030.868|20110107142032.489|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: I'd say Gene 
20110107142032.489|20110107142034.110|TR0|Sperling is less of Goldman 
20110107142034.110|20110107142035.731|TR0|Sachs than Bill Daley is of 
20110107142035.731|20110107142037.352|TR0|JPMorgan. I mean, he was there 
20110107142037.352|20110107142038.973|TR0|for a brief period of time. He 
20110107142038.973|20110107142040.594|TR0|did make a lot of money, but he 
20110107142040.594|20110107142042.215|TR0|was advising them more on 
20110107142042.215|20110107142043.836|TR0|charitable giving. So I don't 
20110107142043.836|20110107142045.457|TR0|think he's a total corporate 
20110107142045.457|20110107142047.078|TR0|insider. I think the 
20110107142047.078|20110107142048.699|TR0|progressives that I talked to, 
20110107142048.699|20110107142050.320|TR0|they weren't thrilled with 
20110107142050.320|20110107142051.941|TR0|Sperling, but they weren't 
20110107142051.941|20110107142053.561|TR0|unhappy with him, either. He's 
20110107142053.561|20110107142055.182|TR0|viewed as somewhat of a neutral 
20110107142055.182|20110107142056.803|TR0|broker. In the Clinton 
20110107142056.803|20110107142058.424|TR0|administration, he did push for 
20110107142058.424|20110107142100.045|TR0|NAFTA, policies like that. He 
20110107142100.045|20110107142101.666|TR0|also did push for more spending. 
20110107142101.666|20110107142103.287|TR0|He wrote a book called The 
20110107142103.287|20110107142104.908|TR0|Pro-Growth Progressive, that's 
20110107142104.908|20110107142106.529|TR0|tried to balance Clintonomics 
20110107142106.529|20110107142108.150|TR0|with some more progressive 
20110107142108.150|20110107142109.771|TR0|economics. So I think he's 
20110107142109.771|20110107142111.392|TR0|viewed as more of a fair broker. 
20110107142111.392|20110107142113.013|TR0|But again, the Clinton team is 
20110107142113.013|20110107142114.634|TR0|being reinforced here. And the 
20110107142114.634|20110107142116.255|TR0|worry is, in the same way that 
20110107142116.255|20110107142117.876|TR0|Clinton triangulated post-'94, 
20110107142117.876|20110107142119.497|TR0|will Obama do his own version of 
20110107142119.497|20110107142121.118|TR0|that going forward? He certainly 
20110107142121.118|20110107142122.739|TR0|has the team in place now to go 
20110107142122.739|20110107142124.360|TR0|do that.
20110107142124.360|20110107142125.981|TR0|
20110107142125.981|20110107142127.602|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Remind people, 
20110107142127.602|20110107142129.223|TR0|in terms of Daley, what the 
20110107142129.223|20110107142130.844|TR0|Consumer Protection Agency is 
20110107142130.844|20110107142132.465|TR0|all about that was set up and 
20110107142132.465|20110107142134.086|TR0|what his opposition to it means.
20110107142134.086|20110107142135.707|TR0|
20110107142135.707|20110107142137.328|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Yeah, well, it 
20110107142137.328|20110107142138.949|TR0|was going to be the watchdog, 
20110107142138.949|20110107142140.570|TR0|and it's going to be the 
20110107142140.570|20110107142142.191|TR0|watchdog, for basically ordinary 
20110107142142.191|20110107142143.812|TR0|people, to stem credit card 
20110107142143.812|20110107142145.433|TR0|abuses and financial industry 
20110107142145.433|20110107142147.054|TR0|abuses and to actually have some 
20110107142147.054|20110107142148.675|TR0|power inside the federal 
20110107142148.675|20110107142150.296|TR0|government to do something about 
20110107142150.296|20110107142151.917|TR0|it, which previously didn't 
20110107142151.917|20110107142153.538|TR0|exist. And so, that's why the 
20110107142153.538|20110107142155.159|TR0|banks and the credit card 
20110107142155.159|20110107142156.780|TR0|companies and other people were

20110107142158.400|20110107142200.021|TR0|it. And that's why Daley, as

20110107142201.642|20110107142203.263|TR0|JPMorgan, didn't want it in the 
20110107142203.263|20110107142204.884|TR0|bill. It was very much a flash

20110107142212.989|20110107142214.610|TR0|opinion piece by Bill Daley for

20110107142222.715|20110107142224.336|TR0|or risk electoral disaster not

20110107142250.272|20110107142251.893|TR0|>> ARI BERMAN: Well, this is an 
20110107142251.893|20110107142253.514|TR0|absolute right-wing talking 
20110107142253.514|20110107142255.135|TR0|point that he's pushing. I mean, 
20110107142255.135|20110107142256.756|TR0|if you look at the Obama 
20110107142256.756|20110107142258.377|TR0|administration, they've been 
20110107142258.377|20110107142259.998|TR0|squarely in the center when it 
20110107142259.998|20110107142301.619|TR0|comes to pretty much every 
20110107142301.619|20110107142303.239|TR0|issue, whether it's healthcare 
20110107142303.239|20110107142304.860|TR0|abandoning the public option, 
20110107142304.860|20110107142306.481|TR0|the stimulus loading up with tax 
20110107142306.481|20110107142308.102|TR0|cuts, financial reform not 
20110107142308.102|20110107142309.723|TR0|breaking up the banks. They've, 
20110107142309.723|20110107142311.344|TR0|over and over again, distanced 
20110107142311.344|20110107142312.965|TR0|themselves from the progressive 
20110107142312.965|20110107142314.586|TR0|community and from the left. 
20110107142314.586|20110107142316.207|TR0|Escalated in Afghanistan. 
20110107142316.207|20110107142317.828|TR0|They've tried to govern from 
20110107142317.828|20110107142319.449|TR0|the, quote-unquote, "center." 
20110107142319.449|20110107142321.070|TR0|And so, I think Daley is just 
20110107142321.070|20110107142322.691|TR0|reinforcing the notion that 
20110107142322.691|20110107142324.312|TR0|Obama is on the far left, which 
20110107142324.312|20110107142325.933|TR0|we all know is not true. And so, 
20110107142325.933|20110107142327.554|TR0|if Daley believes Obama was too 
20110107142327.554|20110107142329.175|TR0|far left in the last two years, 
20110107142329.175|20110107142330.796|TR0|when he was really, I think, in 
20110107142330.796|20110107142332.417|TR0|the center, then I think in the 
20110107142332.417|20110107142334.038|TR0|next two years, as he moves to 
20110107142334.038|20110107142335.659|TR0|the right, what was previously 
20110107142335.659|20110107142337.280|TR0|regarded as the center may all 
20110107142337.280|20110107142338.901|TR0|but cease to exist.

20110107142616.136|20110107142617.756|TR0| and Forst knows that, that it 
20110107142617.756|20110107142619.377|TR0|was really  --
20110107142619.377|20110107142620.998|TR0|
20110107142620.998|20110107142622.619|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, he's from 
20110107142622.619|20110107142624.240|TR0|Boston, right?
20110107142624.240|20110107142625.861|TR0|
20110107142625.861|20110107142627.482|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yes. It was 
20110107142627.482|20110107142629.103|TR0|really, really Ted Williams and 
20110107142629.103|20110107142630.724|TR0|Manny Ramirez that got iced.
20110107142630.724|20110107142632.345|TR0|
20110107142632.345|20110107142633.966|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, how were you 
20110107142633.966|20110107142635.587|TR0|told?
20110107142635.587|20110107142637.208|TR0|
20110107142637.208|20110107142638.829|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: I just got an 
20110107142638.829|20110107142640.450|TR0|email from the boss, and said, 
20110107142640.450|20110107142642.071|TR0|"Come on in for a meeting." And 
20110107142642.071|20110107142643.692|TR0|I was closing a cover, so I 
20110107142643.692|20110107142645.313|TR0|said, "Well, could we put this 
20110107142645.313|20110107142646.934|TR0|off for a few days?" because I 
20110107142646.934|20110107142648.555|TR0|had no idea that this was going 
20110107142648.555|20110107142650.176|TR0|to happen. But I was - I had 
20110107142650.176|20110107142651.797|TR0|just interviewed the subject of 
20110107142651.797|20110107142653.418|TR0|the story, who happens to be Al 
20110107142653.418|20110107142655.039|TR0|Sharpton. I just got off the 
20110107142655.039|20110107142656.660|TR0|phone when I got this email. And 
20110107142656.660|20110107142658.281|TR0|so, I went into the office, and 
20110107142658.281|20110107142659.902|TR0|then he said Tom Robbins was 
20110107142659.902|20110107142701.523|TR0|going to join the meeting. And 
20110107142701.523|20110107142703.144|TR0|Tom is the union rep for the 
20110107142703.144|20110107142704.765|TR0|Voice. Juan knows that well from 
20110107142704.765|20110107142706.386|TR0|his days at the Daily News. He's 
20110107142706.386|20110107142708.007|TR0|our union fighter. So, anyway, 
20110107142708.007|20110107142709.628|TR0|that was a pretty bad sign. And 
20110107142709.628|20110107142711.249|TR0|so, we go into the meeting, and 
20110107142711.249|20110107142712.870|TR0|they basically just said - Tony 
20110107142712.870|20110107142714.491|TR0|just said - I mean, he praised 
20110107142714.491|20110107142716.112|TR0|my work. He just said, "This is 
20110107142716.112|20110107142717.733|TR0|a budget issue." I'm an 
20110107142717.733|20110107142719.354|TR0|expensive asset of the paper  -- 
20110107142719.354|20110107142720.975|TR0| I think I was an asset. "And 
20110107142720.975|20110107142722.595|TR0|we're going to have to let you 
20110107142722.595|20110107142724.216|TR0|go." So, they gave me a very 
20110107142724.216|20110107142725.837|TR0|generous severance package. It 
20110107142725.837|20110107142727.458|TR0|was a great disappointment to 
20110107142727.458|20110107142729.079|TR0|me, but I really do  --
20110107142729.079|20110107142730.700|TR0|
20110107142730.700|20110107142732.321|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You've been 
20110107142732.321|20110107142733.942|TR0|there for more than 40 years.
20110107142733.942|20110107142735.563|TR0|
20110107142735.563|20110107142737.184|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yeah. It does 
20110107142737.184|20110107142738.805|TR0|seem to me to open a lot of 
20110107142738.805|20110107142740.426|TR0|doors for me, and I don't - you 
20110107142740.426|20110107142742.047|TR0|know, I'm not ready to hang up 
20110107142742.047|20110107142743.668|TR0|these fingers.
20110107142743.668|20110107142745.289|TR0|
20110107142745.289|20110107142746.910|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You came into 
20110107142746.910|20110107142748.531|TR0|office, if you will, into your 
20110107142748.531|20110107142750.152|TR0|office at the Village Voice, the 
20110107142750.152|20110107142751.773|TR0|same day as Ed Koch?
20110107142751.773|20110107142753.394|TR0|
20110107142753.394|20110107142755.015|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Well, I 
20110107142755.015|20110107142756.636|TR0|started the column. I wrote 
20110107142756.636|20110107142758.257|TR0|before - I wrote for the Voice 
20110107142758.257|20110107142759.878|TR0|before that. But I got the 
20110107142759.878|20110107142801.499|TR0|"Running Scared" column, which - 
20110107142801.499|20110107142803.120|TR0|don't confuse it with the 
20110107142803.120|20110107142804.741|TR0|current website, the blog on the 
20110107142804.741|20110107142806.362|TR0|current website. But I got the 
20110107142806.362|20110107142807.983|TR0|"Running Scared" column, which 
20110107142807.983|20110107142809.604|TR0|then was the first two pages in 
20110107142809.604|20110107142811.225|TR0|the newspaper and was kind of - 
20110107142811.225|20110107142812.846|TR0|really the center of our local 
20110107142812.846|20110107142814.467|TR0|political coverage. I got that 
20110107142814.467|20110107142816.088|TR0|in 1978, the same day as Ed 
20110107142816.088|20110107142817.709|TR0|Koch. But I had written some for 
20110107142817.709|20110107142819.330|TR0|the paper before that. But it 
20110107142819.330|20110107142820.951|TR0|was that column, which, really, 
20110107142820.951|20110107142822.572|TR0|in those days was, I think, a 
20110107142822.572|20110107142824.193|TR0|central, central part of the 
20110107142824.193|20110107142825.814|TR0|politics of New York. I 
20110107142825.814|20110107142827.434|TR0|inherited it from people like 
20110107142827.434|20110107142829.055|TR0|Newfield, Jack Newfield. Ken 
20110107142829.055|20110107142830.676|TR0|Auletta used to write it, you 
20110107142830.676|20110107142832.297|TR0|know, in his progressive days. 
20110107142832.297|20110107142833.918|TR0|And lots of - Joe Conason - lots 
20110107142833.918|20110107142835.539|TR0|of great people. Jeff Greenfield 
20110107142835.539|20110107142837.160|TR0|wrote it a few times. So lots of 
20110107142837.160|20110107142838.781|TR0|great people wrote that column.
20110107142838.781|20110107142840.402|TR0|
20110107142840.402|20110107142842.023|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, the 
20110107142842.023|20110107142843.644|TR0|amazing thing is -
20110107142843.644|20110107142845.265|TR0|
20110107142845.265|20110107142846.886|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: I think Mike 
20110107142846.886|20110107142848.507|TR0|Daly did, from your paper.
20110107142848.507|20110107142850.128|TR0|
20110107142850.128|20110107142851.749|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Yes, yes.
20110107142851.749|20110107142853.370|TR0|
20110107142853.370|20110107142854.991|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: I think Mike 
20110107142854.991|20110107142856.612|TR0|Daly wrote "Running Scared," 
20110107142856.612|20110107142858.233|TR0|yeah.
20110107142858.233|20110107142859.854|TR0|
20110107142859.854|20110107142901.475|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: The amazing 
20110107142901.475|20110107142903.096|TR0|thing, obviously, the rest of 
20110107142903.096|20110107142904.717|TR0|the journalism community was 
20110107142904.717|20110107142906.338|TR0|stunned, because everyone knows 
20110107142906.338|20110107142907.959|TR0|the storied history of the Voice 
20110107142907.959|20110107142909.580|TR0|and its role in unearthing 
20110107142909.580|20110107142911.201|TR0|stories that the regular dailies 
20110107142911.201|20110107142912.822|TR0|never did. And it's almost as if 
20110107142912.822|20110107142914.443|TR0|there's no more reason to read 
20110107142914.443|20110107142916.064|TR0|the Voice, after you and Tom 
20110107142916.064|20110107142917.685|TR0|leave, and all the others who 
20110107142917.685|20110107142919.306|TR0|wrote there and have ended up, 
20110107142919.306|20110107142920.927|TR0|like Nat Hentoff and Jim 
20110107142920.927|20110107142922.548|TR0|Ridgeway, being cut loose by the 
20110107142922.548|20110107142924.169|TR0|paper as it seeks to find its 
20110107142924.169|20110107142925.790|TR0|niche or market. And it appears 
20110107142925.790|20110107142927.411|TR0|that there's no more room in 
20110107142927.411|20110107142929.032|TR0|commercial media, whether it's 
20110107142929.032|20110107142930.653|TR0|alternative or the regular 
20110107142930.653|20110107142932.273|TR0|dailies, for in-depth reporting.
20110107142932.273|20110107142933.894|TR0|
20110107142933.894|20110107142935.515|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Well, we don't 
20110107142935.515|20110107142937.136|TR0|know what's going to happen next 
20110107142937.136|20110107142938.757|TR0|at the Voice. You know, Tony 
20110107142938.757|20110107142940.378|TR0|Ortega is the editor-in-chief. 
20110107142940.378|20110107142941.999|TR0|I'm just telling you, he's an 
20110107142941.999|20110107142943.620|TR0|extremely capable young man. 
20110107142943.620|20110107142945.241|TR0|Extremely capable. I don't know 
20110107142945.241|20110107142946.862|TR0|if he has a plan to make the 
20110107142946.862|20110107142948.483|TR0|paper do great things in the 
20110107142948.483|20110107142950.104|TR0|future, but I know he has the 
20110107142950.104|20110107142951.725|TR0|ability to do it. And, you know, 
20110107142951.725|20110107142953.346|TR0|the paper does have some 
20110107142953.346|20110107142954.967|TR0|economic problems. Every paper 
20110107142954.967|20110107142956.588|TR0|does. You know, I don't see this 
20110107142956.588|20110107142958.209|TR0|as the end of the paper in some 
20110107142958.209|20110107142959.830|TR0|way. I think it may be passing 
20110107142959.830|20110107143001.451|TR0|into some new era, which, you 
20110107143001.451|20110107143003.072|TR0|know, there's a lot of promising 
20110107143003.072|20110107143004.693|TR0|young journalists in town. I'm 
20110107143004.693|20110107143006.314|TR0|very dismayed about some of the 
20110107143006.314|20110107143007.935|TR0|things that happened at the 
20110107143007.935|20110107143009.556|TR0|paper, you know, but at the same 
20110107143009.556|20110107143011.177|TR0|time, I certainly don't want to 
20110107143011.177|20110107143012.798|TR0|write its epitaph. And, you 
20110107143012.798|20110107143014.419|TR0|know, I gave most of my life to 
20110107143014.419|20110107143016.040|TR0|it. I hope it prospers.
20110107143016.040|20110107143017.661|TR0|
20110107143017.661|20110107143019.282|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Let's talk 
20110107143019.282|20110107143020.903|TR0|about some of those great 
20110107143020.903|20110107143022.524|TR0|stories that you broke over the 
20110107143022.524|20110107143024.145|TR0|years, because I don't think 
20110107143024.145|20110107143025.766|TR0|there's a politician in town who 
20110107143025.766|20110107143027.387|TR0|has not, at one point or another 
20110107143027.387|20110107143029.008|TR0|- or major politician in town 
20110107143029.008|20110107143030.629|TR0|who has not, at one point or 
20110107143030.629|20110107143032.250|TR0|another, been the subject of 
20110107143032.250|20110107143033.871|TR0|your scrutiny.
20110107143033.871|20110107143035.492|TR0|
20110107143035.492|20110107143037.112|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: I tried, yeah.
20110107143037.112|20110107143038.733|TR0|
20110107143038.733|20110107143040.354|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And talk, 
20110107143040.354|20110107143041.975|TR0|first of all, about Ed Koch and 
20110107143041.975|20110107143043.596|TR0|your relationship with Ed Koch, 
20110107143043.596|20110107143045.217|TR0|and then go on to Rudy Guiliani, 
20110107143045.217|20110107143046.838|TR0|as well.
20110107143046.838|20110107143048.459|TR0|
20110107143048.459|20110107143050.080|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Well, what's 
20110107143050.080|20110107143051.701|TR0|really astonishing, if - the New 
20110107143051.701|20110107143053.322|TR0|York Times story, they actually 
20110107143053.322|20110107143054.943|TR0|quote Ed Koch as saying, "His 
20110107143054.943|20110107143056.564|TR0|reporting, superb." Now, that is 
20110107143056.564|20110107143058.185|TR0|about the most gracious thing 
20110107143058.185|20110107143059.806|TR0|that I have seen. Now, he could 
20110107143059.806|20110107143101.427|TR0|have figured out a way - he's a 
20110107143101.427|20110107143103.048|TR0|very capable guy with his tongue 
20110107143103.048|20110107143104.669|TR0|- he could have figured out a 
20110107143104.669|20110107143106.290|TR0|way to be nice in an obit, 
20110107143106.290|20110107143107.911|TR0|right? But he really - that was 
20110107143107.911|20110107143109.532|TR0|really a very generous comment. 
20110107143109.532|20110107143111.153|TR0|So it's a little hard for me to 
20110107143111.153|20110107143112.774|TR0|kick him around this morning.
20110107143112.774|20110107143114.395|TR0|
20110107143114.395|20110107143116.016|TR0|But, you know, the problem - 
20110107143116.016|20110107143117.637|TR0|what we did with Ed Koch - and 
20110107143117.637|20110107143119.258|TR0|it wasn't just me; this was a 
20110107143119.258|20110107143120.879|TR0|great team at the _Voice. 
20110107143120.879|20110107143122.500|TR0|Newfield was very much involved 
20110107143122.500|20110107143124.121|TR0|in this at that time, and he 
20110107143124.121|20110107143125.742|TR0|brought me to the Voice, he was 
20110107143125.742|20110107143127.363|TR0|my mentor.
20110107143127.363|20110107143128.984|TR0|
20110107143128.984|20110107143130.605|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Jack Newfield?
20110107143130.605|20110107143132.226|TR0|
20110107143132.226|20110107143133.847|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yes. And I - 
20110107143133.847|20110107143135.468|TR0|you know, but what we were - you 
20110107143135.468|20110107143137.089|TR0|know, we were looking at the 
20110107143137.089|20110107143138.710|TR0|Koch administration. Here's the 
20110107143138.710|20110107143140.331|TR0|guy who beat Carmine DeSapio, 
20110107143140.331|20110107143141.951|TR0|beat the Democratic machine in 
20110107143141.951|20110107143143.572|TR0|New York, and then he became a 
20110107143143.572|20110107143145.193|TR0|machine mayor who was so linked 
20110107143145.193|20110107143146.814|TR0|to the party bosses, all of whom 
20110107143146.814|20110107143148.435|TR0|wound up going to jail or 
20110107143148.435|20110107143150.056|TR0|killing themselves. And so, this 
20110107143150.056|20110107143151.677|TR0|was - we were really the reform 
20110107143151.677|20110107143153.298|TR0|newspaper of New York. And here 
20110107143153.298|20110107143154.919|TR0|was this guy who we thought was 
20110107143154.919|20110107143156.540|TR0|a reformer, who, I think, 
20110107143156.540|20110107143158.161|TR0|betrayed the reform movement in 
20110107143158.161|20110107143159.782|TR0|very fundamental ways. And then, 
20110107143159.782|20110107143201.403|TR0|of course, the question of race 
20110107143201.403|20110107143203.024|TR0|was the question that dogged him 
20110107143203.024|20110107143204.645|TR0|throughout his administration. 
20110107143204.645|20110107143206.266|TR0|Now, Koch did - in his final 
20110107143206.266|20110107143207.887|TR0|term, he did the most remarkable 
20110107143207.887|20110107143209.508|TR0|thing that still has, I think, 
20110107143209.508|20110107143211.129|TR0|transformed the life of the city 
20110107143211.129|20110107143212.750|TR0|in many ways, which was he 
20110107143212.750|20110107143214.371|TR0|started using city funds, 
20110107143214.371|20110107143215.992|TR0|capital funds, to build housing. 
20110107143215.992|20110107143217.613|TR0|It had never been done before. 
20110107143217.613|20110107143219.234|TR0|Billions have been spent on it 
20110107143219.234|20110107143220.855|TR0|since. And it has transformed 
20110107143220.855|20110107143222.476|TR0|neighborhoods. And so, he 
20110107143222.476|20110107143224.097|TR0|launched something in his final 
20110107143224.097|20110107143225.718|TR0|term that was extraordinarily 
20110107143225.718|20110107143227.339|TR0|significant, and I think it's 
20110107143227.339|20110107143228.960|TR0|his legacy.
20110107143228.960|20110107143230.581|TR0|
20110107143230.581|20110107143232.202|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You wrote in 
20110107143232.202|20110107143233.823|TR0|your final piece about the Voice 
20110107143233.823|20110107143235.444|TR0|celebrating its 50th 
20110107143235.444|20110107143237.065|TR0|anniversary, something you wrote 
20110107143237.065|20110107143238.686|TR0|then: "We thought a deadline 
20110107143238.686|20110107143240.307|TR0|meant we had to kill somebody by 
20110107143240.307|20110107143241.928|TR0|closing time."
20110107143241.928|20110107143243.549|TR0|
20110107143243.549|20110107143245.170|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yes, yes, yes. 
20110107143245.170|20110107143246.790|TR0|And we were happy to do it.
20110107143246.790|20110107143248.411|TR0|
20110107143248.411|20110107143250.032|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And when your 
20110107143250.032|20110107143251.653|TR0|kid asked you to come to class 
20110107143251.653|20110107143253.274|TR0|to talk about what it meant to 
20110107143253.274|20110107143254.895|TR0|be a journalist, you dressed up?
20110107143254.895|20110107143256.516|TR0|
20110107143256.516|20110107143258.137|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yeah, I put on 
20110107143258.137|20110107143259.758|TR0|a trench coat. This was - he was 
20110107143259.758|20110107143301.379|TR0|in elementary school, public 
20110107143301.379|20110107143303.000|TR0|elementary school, right down 
20110107143303.000|20110107143304.621|TR0|the block. And I go down there 
20110107143304.621|20110107143306.242|TR0|with a trench coat. I put the 
20110107143306.242|20110107143307.863|TR0|collar up. You know, I had the 
20110107143307.863|20110107143309.484|TR0|notebook in my pocket. I pulled 
20110107143309.484|20110107143311.105|TR0|the notebook out. This is in the 
20110107143311.105|20110107143312.726|TR0|auditorium; it was the whole 
20110107143312.726|20110107143314.347|TR0|school. You know, it was not 
20110107143314.347|20110107143315.968|TR0|just a class. I pulled a 
20110107143315.968|20110107143317.589|TR0|notebook out. I said, "We are 
20110107143317.589|20110107143319.210|TR0|detectives for the people."
20110107143319.210|20110107143320.831|TR0|
20110107143320.831|20110107143322.452|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And do you think 
20110107143322.452|20110107143324.073|TR0|reporters still are?
20110107143324.073|20110107143325.694|TR0|
20110107143325.694|20110107143327.315|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yes. Yes, I 
20110107143327.315|20110107143328.936|TR0|do. I just think - you know, 
20110107143328.936|20110107143330.557|TR0|when you look around at the 
20110107143330.557|20110107143332.178|TR0|scandals, the troubles, so many 
20110107143332.178|20110107143333.799|TR0|professions, how often is it 
20110107143333.799|20110107143335.420|TR0|that we ever hear anything about 
20110107143335.420|20110107143337.041|TR0|a corrupt journalist? And it's 
20110107143337.041|20110107143338.662|TR0|not because other journalists 
20110107143338.662|20110107143340.283|TR0|are covering up for corrupt 
20110107143340.283|20110107143341.904|TR0|journalists. We find them the 
20110107143341.904|20110107143343.525|TR0|most - they're a very, very rare 
20110107143343.525|20110107143345.146|TR0|commodity, journalists who would 
20110107143345.146|20110107143346.767|TR0|take money for a story or to not 
20110107143346.767|20110107143348.388|TR0|write a story. We never hear 
20110107143348.388|20110107143350.009|TR0|these things. I mean, we hear 
20110107143350.009|20110107143351.629|TR0|about corrupt lawyers. We know 
20110107143351.629|20110107143353.250|TR0|all kinds of things about every 
20110107143353.250|20110107143354.871|TR0|profession that makes us shake 
20110107143354.871|20110107143356.492|TR0|sometimes. But ours is such an 
20110107143356.492|20110107143358.113|TR0|honorable profession, a great 
20110107143358.113|20110107143359.734|TR0|profession. There's lots of 
20110107143359.734|20110107143401.355|TR0|flaws in the media, but no, I 
20110107143401.355|20110107143402.976|TR0|think it's - and I see all these 
20110107143402.976|20110107143404.597|TR0|good young people. I teach a 
20110107143404.597|20110107143406.218|TR0|little bit up at Columbia 
20110107143406.218|20110107143407.839|TR0|Journalism. I have had an army 
20110107143407.839|20110107143409.460|TR0|of interns for the Voice. I mean 
20110107143409.460|20110107143411.081|TR0|literally hundreds of interns 
20110107143411.081|20110107143412.702|TR0|that have worked with me over 
20110107143412.702|20110107143414.323|TR0|the years.
20110107143414.323|20110107143415.944|TR0|
20110107143415.944|20110107143417.565|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That's your 
20110107143417.565|20110107143419.186|TR0|entire staff - right? - there, 
20110107143419.186|20110107143420.807|TR0|is volunteer interns.
20110107143420.807|20110107143422.428|TR0|
20110107143422.428|20110107143424.049|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yeah. I love 
20110107143424.049|20110107143425.670|TR0|to work with young people, and I 
20110107143425.670|20110107143427.291|TR0|see great promise in the young 
20110107143427.291|20110107143428.912|TR0|people. It's amazing that 
20110107143428.912|20110107143430.533|TR0|they're still so drawn to this 
20110107143430.533|20110107143432.154|TR0|profession, because we don't 
20110107143432.154|20110107143433.775|TR0|have a business model that 
20110107143433.775|20110107143435.396|TR0|works, really. You have a 
20110107143435.396|20110107143437.017|TR0|business model that works, you 
20110107143437.017|20110107143438.638|TR0|know, but we don't have a 
20110107143438.638|20110107143440.259|TR0|business model that works in the

20110107143441.880|20110107143443.501|TR0|are still flooding to this 
20110107143443.501|20110107143445.122|TR0|profession. And I think they're 
20110107143445.122|20110107143446.743|TR0|drawn to it because we're truth 
20110107143446.743|20110107143448.364|TR0|tellers. You know, these are 
20110107143448.364|20110107143449.985|TR0|idealistic people. They want to 
20110107143449.985|20110107143451.606|TR0|make a reasonable living. But 
20110107143451.606|20110107143453.227|TR0|it's still a beacon of a 
20110107143453.227|20110107143454.848|TR0|profession, I think.

20110107143527.267|20110107143528.888|TR0|York state for many years. He 
20110107143528.888|20110107143530.509|TR0|may still be, as a lobbyist, the 
20110107143530.509|20110107143532.130|TR0|most powerful Republican in New

20110107143535.372|20110107143536.993|TR0|greatest journalistic prize was 
20110107143536.993|20110107143538.614|TR0|when he called me a "viper" in

20110107143558.066|20110107143559.687|TR0|Rudy Guiliani, you had a

20110107143606.170|20110107143607.791|TR0|Well, you know, I always thought 
20110107143607.791|20110107143609.412|TR0|that - you know, that great 
20110107143609.412|20110107143611.033|TR0|documentary, Hoop Dreams, you 
20110107143611.033|20110107143612.654|TR0|know. Did I miss some things in 
20110107143612.654|20110107143614.275|TR0|the early career of Rudy, 
20110107143614.275|20110107143615.896|TR0|especially the Haitian issue and 
20110107143615.896|20110107143617.517|TR0|how he dealt with that? Yeah, it 
20110107143617.517|20110107143619.138|TR0|was a blind spot. But by and 
20110107143619.138|20110107143620.759|TR0|large, I think he was an 
20110107143620.759|20110107143622.380|TR0|outstanding United States 
20110107143622.380|20110107143624.001|TR0|attorney; to this day, I believe 
20110107143624.001|20110107143625.622|TR0|that. And so, I was an admirer 
20110107143625.622|20110107143627.243|TR0|of his when he was United States 
20110107143627.243|20110107143628.864|TR0|attorney in the Southern 
20110107143628.864|20110107143630.485|TR0|District. I knew him very well. 
20110107143630.485|20110107143632.106|TR0|But I don't think I was seduced.
20110107143632.106|20110107143633.727|TR0|
20110107143633.727|20110107143635.348|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Right.
20110107143635.348|20110107143636.969|TR0|
20110107143636.969|20110107143638.590|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: I think he 
20110107143638.590|20110107143640.211|TR0|still has a record that stands 
20110107143640.211|20110107143641.832|TR0|the test of time as a federal 
20110107143641.832|20110107143643.453|TR0|prosecutor. But if you were to 
20110107143643.453|20110107143645.074|TR0|do a Hoop Dreams-like 
20110107143645.074|20110107143646.695|TR0|documentary on him and see what 
20110107143646.695|20110107143648.316|TR0|kind of a transformation has 
20110107143648.316|20110107143649.937|TR0|occurred with this man, I 
20110107143649.937|20110107143651.558|TR0|thought he was a person - he 
20110107143651.558|20110107143653.179|TR0|went after Ed Meese, Ronald 
20110107143653.179|20110107143654.800|TR0|Reagan's closest friend, who was 
20110107143654.800|20110107143656.421|TR0|his boss and the attorney 
20110107143656.421|20110107143658.042|TR0|general of the United States. He 
20110107143658.042|20110107143659.663|TR0|sent an assistant into a trial 
20110107143659.663|20110107143701.284|TR0|in a summation of the jury to 
20110107143701.284|20110107143702.905|TR0|denounce the attorney general he 
20110107143702.905|20110107143704.526|TR0|worked for as a sleaze, in a 
20110107143704.526|20110107143706.146|TR0|summation, in a summation to the 
20110107143706.146|20110107143707.767|TR0|jury. So he really demonstrated 
20110107143707.767|20110107143709.388|TR0|an enormous independence at that 
20110107143709.388|20110107143711.009|TR0|time. And to see the public 
20110107143711.009|20110107143712.630|TR0|figure he became, I describe him 
20110107143712.630|20110107143714.251|TR0|as a used 9/11 memorabilia 
20110107143714.251|20110107143715.872|TR0|salesman now. You know, this is 
20110107143715.872|20110107143717.493|TR0|all he does is, still, travel 
20110107143717.493|20110107143719.114|TR0|the country selling 9/11.
20110107143719.114|20110107143720.735|TR0|
20110107143720.735|20110107143722.356|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Where was he - 
20110107143722.356|20110107143723.977|TR0|this is a question, Juan, you 
20110107143723.977|20110107143725.598|TR0|were asking the other day. Where 
20110107143725.598|20110107143727.219|TR0|was he, until - well, at the 
20110107143727.219|20110107143728.840|TR0|very end, came out - and 
20110107143728.840|20110107143730.461|TR0|Governor Pataki, when it came to 
20110107143730.461|20110107143732.082|TR0|the 9/11 bill in Washington? Two 
20110107143732.082|20110107143733.703|TR0|major Republican figures, both 
20110107143733.703|20110107143735.324|TR0|presidential ambitions, when it 
20110107143735.324|20110107143736.945|TR0|came to pushing for that bill.
20110107143736.945|20110107143738.566|TR0|
20110107143738.566|20110107143740.187|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Well, Rudy, at 
20110107143740.187|20110107143741.808|TR0|the end - as you say, Rudy, at 
20110107143741.808|20110107143743.429|TR0|the end, finally did say some of 
20110107143743.429|20110107143745.050|TR0|the right things. But he's been 
20110107143745.050|20110107143746.671|TR0|- I think - I don't think Rudy's 
20110107143746.671|20110107143748.292|TR0|done. I mean, he's done as a 
20110107143748.292|20110107143749.913|TR0|presidential candidate, but I 
20110107143749.913|20110107143751.534|TR0|don't think he's done as a 
20110107143751.534|20110107143753.155|TR0|possible vice-presidential 
20110107143753.155|20110107143754.776|TR0|candidate. I think that's what 
20110107143754.776|20110107143756.397|TR0|he's thinking. You see him 
20110107143756.397|20110107143758.018|TR0|praising Sarah Palin all the 
20110107143758.018|20110107143759.639|TR0|time. And he would be the 
20110107143759.639|20110107143801.260|TR0|natural as - you know, you're 
20110107143801.260|20110107143802.881|TR0|going to have to buttress her 
20110107143802.881|20110107143804.502|TR0|national security credentials. 
20110107143804.502|20110107143806.123|TR0|And even though whatever his 
20110107143806.123|20110107143807.744|TR0|claim is to national security 
20110107143807.744|20110107143809.365|TR0|credentials is so incredibly 
20110107143809.365|20110107143810.985|TR0|dubious, that any - a minute of 
20110107143810.985|20110107143812.606|TR0|inspection would tell - that's 
20110107143812.606|20110107143814.227|TR0|still, you know, the way the 
20110107143814.227|20110107143815.848|TR0|media treats him and the way he 
20110107143815.848|20110107143817.469|TR0|presents himself, as if he's a 
20110107143817.469|20110107143819.090|TR0|great warrior, he understands 
20110107143819.090|20110107143820.711|TR0|how to protect America. So, she 
20110107143820.711|20110107143822.332|TR0|made need that if she's the 
20110107143822.332|20110107143823.953|TR0|nominee, and Rudy has a natural 
20110107143823.953|20110107143825.574|TR0|card to play there.

20110107143859.615|20110107143901.236|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Well, I always 
20110107143901.236|20110107143902.857|TR0|say the worst two people on my 
20110107143902.857|20110107143904.478|TR0|beat are the two Als: you know, 
20110107143904.478|20110107143906.099|TR0|D'Amato and Sharpton. I mean, 
20110107143906.099|20110107143907.720|TR0|Sharpton is - Sharpton - I just 
20110107143907.720|20110107143909.341|TR0|was interviewed by Lesley Stahl, 
20110107143909.341|20110107143910.962|TR0|who's - they're going to do a 60 
20110107143910.962|20110107143912.583|TR0|Minutes portrait of Al Sharpton. 
20110107143912.583|20110107143914.204|TR0|I think it's going to air either 
20110107143914.204|20110107143915.824|TR0|this Sunday or next Sunday. And 
20110107143915.824|20110107143917.445|TR0|I think I was the token negative 
20110107143917.445|20110107143919.066|TR0|voice. I obviously haven't seen 
20110107143919.066|20110107143920.687|TR0|the whole thing, so maybe there 
20110107143920.687|20110107143922.308|TR0|are 20 negative voices there. 
20110107143922.308|20110107143923.929|TR0|But I certainly got the 
20110107143923.929|20110107143925.550|TR0|impression it was a very 
20110107143925.550|20110107143927.171|TR0|positive - a very positive 
20110107143927.171|20110107143928.792|TR0|piece. And it was Pete Hamill 
20110107143928.792|20110107143930.413|TR0|and myself being interviewed by 
20110107143930.413|20110107143932.034|TR0|Lesley Stahl in a bar. And, you 
20110107143932.034|20110107143933.655|TR0|know, the theme of it seemed to 
20110107143933.655|20110107143935.276|TR0|be the new Al Sharpton, the Al 
20110107143935.276|20110107143936.897|TR0|Sharpton that Barack Obama - 
20110107143936.897|20110107143938.518|TR0|inexplicably, as far as I'm 
20110107143938.518|20110107143940.139|TR0|concerned - has wrapped his arms 
20110107143940.139|20110107143941.760|TR0|around, just because he prefers 
20110107143941.760|20110107143943.381|TR0|him to Jesse, because of all 
20110107143943.381|20110107143945.002|TR0|sorts of problems that occurred 
20110107143945.002|20110107143946.623|TR0|over time in Chicago.
20110107143946.623|20110107143948.244|TR0|
20110107143948.244|20110107143949.865|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And Michael 
20110107143949.865|20110107143951.486|TR0|Bloomberg has wrapped his arms 
20110107143951.486|20110107143953.107|TR0|around him.
20110107143953.107|20110107143954.728|TR0|
20110107143954.728|20110107143956.349|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Oh, Michael 
20110107143956.349|20110107143957.970|TR0|Bloomberg is completely wrapped. 
20110107143957.970|20110107143959.591|TR0|I mean, I think they've had 
20110107143959.591|20110107144001.212|TR0|three press conferences with him 
20110107144001.212|20110107144002.833|TR0|on different issues - one by Ray 
20110107144002.833|20110107144004.454|TR0|Kelly and two by the Mayor 
20110107144004.454|20110107144006.075|TR0|himself  --  in recent weeks. 
20110107144006.075|20110107144007.696|TR0|They might as well make him a 
20110107144007.696|20110107144009.317|TR0|deputy mayor. He could handle 
20110107144009.317|20110107144010.938|TR0|the next snowstorm. Yes. So, and 
20110107144010.938|20110107144012.559|TR0|then you got  --
20110107144012.559|20110107144014.180|TR0|
20110107144014.180|20110107144015.801|TR0|At any rate, the terrible thing, 
20110107144015.801|20110107144017.422|TR0|really, Lesley Stahl is asking 
20110107144017.422|20110107144019.043|TR0|Pete and I questions, and the 
20110107144019.043|20110107144020.663|TR0|theme seems to be the new 
20110107144020.663|20110107144022.284|TR0|Sharpton. And I said I met him 
20110107144022.284|20110107144023.905|TR0|when he was about 16, which I 
20110107144023.905|20110107144025.526|TR0|did. I come from the same 
20110107144025.526|20110107144027.147|TR0|neighborhood he does: Ocean 
20110107144027.147|20110107144028.768|TR0|Hill, Brownsville. I said he was 
20110107144028.768|20110107144030.389|TR0|a young preacher then. I said he 
20110107144030.389|20110107144032.010|TR0|was a hustler then, he's a 
20110107144032.010|20110107144033.631|TR0|hustler now. The only thing 
20110107144033.631|20110107144035.252|TR0|that's happened is the hustle 
20110107144035.252|20110107144036.873|TR0|has gotten bigger. And that's - 
20110107144036.873|20110107144038.494|TR0|you know, I think that's 
20110107144038.494|20110107144040.115|TR0|basically the M.O. of Al 
20110107144040.115|20110107144041.736|TR0|Sharpton. He is - it is really - 
20110107144041.736|20110107144043.357|TR0|to me, he could be the next 
20110107144043.357|20110107144044.978|TR0|Jeremiah Wright, in terms of the 
20110107144044.978|20110107144046.599|TR0|next election, because the 
20110107144046.599|20110107144048.220|TR0|Republicans, I think, are 
20110107144048.220|20110107144049.841|TR0|sitting and waiting and 
20110107144049.841|20110107144051.462|TR0|watching. And I would not be at 
20110107144051.462|20110107144053.083|TR0|all surprised to see, because I 
20110107144053.083|20110107144054.704|TR0|think it's a terrible mistake by 
20110107144054.704|20110107144056.325|TR0|Obama to attach himself so much 
20110107144056.325|20110107144057.946|TR0|to Sharpton - I would not be 
20110107144057.946|20110107144059.567|TR0|surprised to see them try to 
20110107144059.567|20110107144101.188|TR0|turn him into a real issue in 
20110107144101.188|20110107144102.809|TR0|the next presidential election, 
20110107144102.809|20110107144104.430|TR0|you know, and he could blow up 
20110107144104.430|20110107144106.051|TR0|in Obama's face.
20110107144106.051|20110107144107.672|TR0|
20110107144107.672|20110107144109.293|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And yet, his 
20110107144109.293|20110107144110.914|TR0|fighting for racial justice in 
20110107144110.914|20110107144112.535|TR0|this country and continually 
20110107144112.535|20110107144114.156|TR0|putting that on the forefront, a 
20110107144114.156|20110107144115.777|TR0|figure that media will quote -
20110107144115.777|20110107144117.398|TR0|
20110107144117.398|20110107144119.019|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yes.
20110107144119.019|20110107144120.640|TR0|
20110107144120.640|20110107144122.261|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN:  --  media will 
20110107144122.261|20110107144123.882|TR0|have him on their TV shows. And  
20110107144123.882|20110107144125.502|TR0|--
20110107144125.502|20110107144127.123|TR0|
20110107144127.123|20110107144128.744|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yes, you know, 
20110107144128.744|20110107144130.365|TR0|I just - I didn't know about 
20110107144130.365|20110107144131.986|TR0|this. You guys probably do. 
20110107144131.986|20110107144133.607|TR0|There's this rape that occurred 
20110107144133.607|20110107144135.228|TR0|in the Dunbar houses in West 
20110107144135.228|20110107144136.849|TR0|Palm Beach, Florida, where this 
20110107144136.849|20110107144138.470|TR0|black woman was raped by, I 
20110107144138.470|20110107144140.091|TR0|think, up to 10 young black men 
20110107144140.091|20110107144141.712|TR0|in her apartment in this public 
20110107144141.712|20110107144143.333|TR0|housing project. They made her 
20110107144143.333|20110107144144.954|TR0|give oral sex to her 12-year-old 
20110107144144.954|20110107144146.575|TR0|son. They put her in a bathtub 
20110107144146.575|20110107144148.196|TR0|and dumped chemicals all over 
20110107144148.196|20110107144149.817|TR0|her. Sharpton went down to 
20110107144149.817|20110107144151.438|TR0|defend these guys in West Palm 
20110107144151.438|20110107144153.059|TR0|Beach and to say, "Well, there's 
20110107144153.059|20110107144154.680|TR0|these white boys over in Boca 
20110107144154.680|20110107144156.301|TR0|Raton that are getting bail, and 
20110107144156.301|20110107144157.922|TR0|they did a gang rape. Why are 
20110107144157.922|20110107144159.543|TR0|they getting" - you know, and 
20110107144159.543|20110107144201.164|TR0|I'm telling you, the blowback 
20110107144201.164|20110107144202.785|TR0|from black women across the 
20110107144202.785|20110107144204.406|TR0|United States - you read the 
20110107144204.406|20110107144206.027|TR0|blogs, you look at the history 
20110107144206.027|20110107144207.648|TR0|of it - it was just remarkable. 
20110107144207.648|20110107144209.269|TR0|And so then Tamika Mallory, who 
20110107144209.269|20110107144210.890|TR0|is the national director of his 
20110107144210.890|20110107144212.511|TR0|National Action Network, then 
20110107144212.511|20110107144214.132|TR0|starts responding to the blogs 
20110107144214.132|20110107144215.753|TR0|by, believe it or not, bringing 
20110107144215.753|20110107144217.374|TR0|up how Al Sharpton has always 
20110107144217.374|20110107144218.995|TR0|been a great defender of black 
20110107144218.995|20110107144220.616|TR0|women. He cites - they cite 
20110107144220.616|20110107144222.237|TR0|Tawana Brawley. "He's always 
20110107144222.237|20110107144223.858|TR0|stood up against rape of black 
20110107144223.858|20110107144225.479|TR0|women." When it's a proven hoax, 
20110107144225.479|20110107144227.100|TR0|and they're still calling this 
20110107144227.100|20110107144228.721|TR0|card out. So, that's the kind of 
20110107144228.721|20110107144230.341|TR0|way in which the Sharptons 
20110107144230.341|20110107144231.962|TR0|sometimes say the right things 
20110107144231.962|20110107144233.583|TR0|about public issues. He often 
20110107144233.583|20110107144235.204|TR0|does. I'll sit there and watch 
20110107144235.204|20110107144236.825|TR0|him on television, and I'll say, 
20110107144236.825|20110107144238.446|TR0|"I agree with everything the guy 
20110107144238.446|20110107144240.067|TR0|is saying."
20110107144240.067|20110107144241.688|TR0|
20110107144241.688|20110107144243.309|TR0|But look, he just did this thing 
20110107144243.309|20110107144244.930|TR0|in New York politics where he 
20110107144244.930|20110107144246.551|TR0|sat out the gubernatorial 
20110107144246.551|20110107144248.172|TR0|election. He basically 
20110107144248.172|20110107144249.793|TR0|championed one candidate for the 
20110107144249.793|20110107144251.414|TR0|city council in Queens. And he 
20110107144251.414|20110107144253.035|TR0|was implicitly supporting - in 
20110107144253.035|20110107144254.656|TR0|some ways, explicitly supporting 
20110107144254.656|20110107144256.277|TR0|- Charles Barron, who was 
20110107144256.277|20110107144257.898|TR0|running on an independent line 
20110107144257.898|20110107144259.519|TR0|against Andrew Cuomo. So, 
20110107144259.519|20110107144301.140|TR0|Charles Barron, as candidate for 
20110107144301.140|20110107144302.761|TR0|governor, comes in dead last of 
20110107144302.761|20110107144304.382|TR0|six or seven candidates, gets 
20110107144304.382|20110107144306.003|TR0|20,000 votes statewide. His 
20110107144306.003|20110107144307.624|TR0|candidate for city council in 
20110107144307.624|20110107144309.245|TR0|Queens, who he campaigned for in 
20110107144309.245|20110107144310.866|TR0|a way that I have never seen him 
20110107144310.866|20110107144312.487|TR0|campaign in a local election, 
20110107144312.487|20110107144314.108|TR0|gets wiped out. Black voters 
20110107144314.108|20110107144315.729|TR0|reject him every time they get a 
20110107144315.729|20110107144317.350|TR0|chance to do so. And yet, the 
20110107144317.350|20110107144318.971|TR0|white media still empowers him. 
20110107144318.971|20110107144320.592|TR0|I mean, he got eight percent of 
20110107144320.592|20110107144322.213|TR0|the vote when he ran for 
20110107144322.213|20110107144323.834|TR0|president, in New York state. 
20110107144323.834|20110107144325.455|TR0|John Kerry wiped him out in 
20110107144325.455|20110107144327.076|TR0|Harlem. And yet, still, the 
20110107144327.076|20110107144328.697|TR0|media treats him as if he's this 
20110107144328.697|20110107144330.318|TR0|great spokesperson for black 
20110107144330.318|20110107144331.939|TR0|people.
20110107144331.939|20110107144333.560|TR0|
20110107144333.560|20110107144335.180|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Wayne, I 
20110107144335.180|20110107144336.801|TR0|wanted to ask you to say 
20110107144336.801|20110107144338.422|TR0|something about your 
20110107144338.422|20110107144340.043|TR0|comrade-in-arms, Tom Robbins, 
20110107144340.043|20110107144341.664|TR0|and his decision to resign in 
20110107144341.664|20110107144343.285|TR0|protest. And then, just give us 
20110107144343.285|20110107144344.906|TR0|a sense of what's next for you.
20110107144344.906|20110107144346.527|TR0|
20110107144346.527|20110107144348.148|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Yeah, well, I 
20110107144348.148|20110107144349.769|TR0|wrote this blog saying goodbye, 
20110107144349.769|20110107144351.390|TR0|and I had a line in there, which 
20110107144351.390|20110107144353.011|TR0|Tom asked me to take out, and I 
20110107144353.011|20110107144354.632|TR0|took out. But since the Times 
20110107144354.632|20110107144356.253|TR0|has now revealed that he gave 
20110107144356.253|20110107144357.874|TR0|his kidney to a friend, I wrote 
20110107144357.874|20110107144359.495|TR0|- I think I'm now authorized to 
20110107144359.495|20110107144401.116|TR0|say the line that he asked me to 
20110107144401.116|20110107144402.737|TR0|take out. He said it was private 
20110107144402.737|20110107144404.358|TR0|biz then, but the Times has now 
20110107144404.358|20110107144405.979|TR0|printed that he gave his kidney 
20110107144405.979|20110107144407.600|TR0|to a friend now. And I wrote 
20110107144407.600|20110107144409.221|TR0|that he gave a kidney to a 
20110107144409.221|20110107144410.842|TR0|friend, but he saved the rest of 
20110107144410.842|20110107144412.463|TR0|his body parts for me.
20110107144412.463|20110107144414.084|TR0|
20110107144414.084|20110107144415.705|TR0|And, you know, we walk out of 
20110107144415.705|20110107144417.326|TR0|the paper. He's been in on all 
20110107144417.326|20110107144418.947|TR0|these meetings, you know, that 
20110107144418.947|20110107144420.568|TR0|happened that day. We're going 
20110107144420.568|20110107144422.189|TR0|to the subway together. And he 
20110107144422.189|20110107144423.810|TR0|says, "Oh, by the way, I went in 
20110107144423.810|20110107144425.431|TR0|and told Tony, 'I came in with 
20110107144425.431|20110107144427.052|TR0|this guy, I'm going out with 
20110107144427.052|20110107144428.673|TR0|this guy. I quit.'" He never had 
20110107144428.673|20110107144430.294|TR0|mentioned to me that he was 
20110107144430.294|20110107144431.915|TR0|going to do it, thinking about 
20110107144431.915|20110107144433.536|TR0|doing it. He told me about it 
20110107144433.536|20110107144435.157|TR0|after he did it. So, he's just 
20110107144435.157|20110107144436.778|TR0|one of the most remarkable 
20110107144436.778|20110107144438.399|TR0|people I've ever known. He's 
20110107144438.399|20110107144440.019|TR0|just an extraordinary - I tried 
20110107144440.019|20110107144441.640|TR0|to persuade him not to do this. 
20110107144441.640|20110107144443.261|TR0|I really tried to persuade him 
20110107144443.261|20110107144444.882|TR0|not to do it. I even said to 
20110107144444.882|20110107144446.503|TR0|him, "Tom, if they fired you 
20110107144446.503|20110107144448.124|TR0|before they fired me, I wouldn't 
20110107144448.124|20110107144449.745|TR0|quit." You know. And he said, 
20110107144449.745|20110107144451.366|TR0|"You wouldn't?" I'm trying to 
20110107144451.366|20110107144452.987|TR0|persuade him, you know, "Keep 
20110107144452.987|20110107144454.608|TR0|the paper going. You know, 
20110107144454.608|20110107144456.229|TR0|that's what counts." You know, 
20110107144456.229|20110107144457.850|TR0|but he was determined to do it, 
20110107144457.850|20110107144459.471|TR0|and I'm terribly honored that he 
20110107144459.471|20110107144501.092|TR0|did it. And you know what a guy 
20110107144501.092|20110107144502.713|TR0|he is. He's just the most 
20110107144502.713|20110107144504.334|TR0|stand-up guy you'll ever know.
20110107144504.334|20110107144505.955|TR0|
20110107144505.955|20110107144507.576|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Your plans now?
20110107144507.576|20110107144509.197|TR0|
20110107144509.197|20110107144510.818|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Well, you 
20110107144510.818|20110107144512.439|TR0|know, the good people at the 
20110107144512.439|20110107144514.060|TR0|Nation Institute - I was there 
20110107144514.060|20110107144515.681|TR0|yesterday afternoon for the 
20110107144515.681|20110107144517.302|TR0|first time - have, you know, 
20110107144517.302|20110107144518.923|TR0|given me a place to hang my hat. 
20110107144518.923|20110107144520.544|TR0|And the Nation Institute is 
20110107144520.544|20110107144522.165|TR0|connected to The Nation 
20110107144522.165|20110107144523.786|TR0|magazine, but it is not The 
20110107144523.786|20110107144525.407|TR0|Nation magazine. And they help 
20110107144525.407|20110107144527.028|TR0|fund stories, individual 
20110107144527.028|20110107144528.649|TR0|stories. This doesn't involve a 
20110107144528.649|20110107144530.270|TR0|wage for me. It may involve a 
20110107144530.270|20110107144531.891|TR0|small stipend. But it does give 
20110107144531.891|20110107144533.512|TR0|me an office. It gives me 
20110107144533.512|20110107144535.133|TR0|databases. It gives me what we 
20110107144535.133|20110107144536.754|TR0|all need in this life, an 
20110107144536.754|20110107144538.375|TR0|institutional email address. You 
20110107144538.375|20110107144539.996|TR0|know, otherwise, you just got 
20110107144539.996|20110107144541.617|TR0|your personal email address. So, 
20110107144541.617|20110107144543.238|TR0|it's going to be terrific to 
20110107144543.238|20110107144544.858|TR0|work out of there. And I'll 
20110107144544.858|20110107144546.479|TR0|write stories. I may write 
20110107144546.479|20110107144548.100|TR0|books. And I've been astonished 
20110107144548.100|20110107144549.721|TR0|at the number of people who have 
20110107144549.721|20110107144551.342|TR0|called me. Would you believe I'm 
20110107144551.342|20110107144552.963|TR0|going to have a byline in the 
20110107144552.963|20110107144554.584|TR0|New York Post on Sunday? They 
20110107144554.584|20110107144556.205|TR0|asked me to write something for 
20110107144556.205|20110107144557.826|TR0|the - and it's not about me. You 
20110107144557.826|20110107144559.447|TR0|know, so...
20110107144559.447|20110107144601.068|TR0|
20110107144601.068|20110107144602.689|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And your advice 
20110107144602.689|20110107144604.310|TR0|to young journalists?
20110107144604.310|20110107144605.931|TR0|
20110107144605.931|20110107144607.552|TR0|>> WAYNE BARRETT: Well, you 
20110107144607.552|20110107144609.173|TR0|can't find a better job. Let's 
20110107144609.173|20110107144610.794|TR0|just hope the guys who make the 
20110107144610.794|20110107144612.415|TR0|money figure out how to keep the 
20110107144612.415|20110107144614.036|TR0|model of a newspaper going. It's 
20110107144614.036|20110107144615.657|TR0|a great job. And I've loved 
20110107144615.657|20110107144617.278|TR0|every minute of my years at the 
20110107144617.278|20110107144618.899|TR0|Voice, and I think I'll love 
20110107144618.899|20110107144620.520|TR0|whatever time I have left to hit 
20110107144620.520|20110107144622.141|TR0|the keys, because it's just such 
20110107144622.141|20110107144623.762|TR0|a great job.

20110107144627.004|20110107144628.625|TR0|story about CityTime, you know, 
20110107144628.625|20110107144630.246|TR0|which is a big scandal in New 
20110107144630.246|20110107144631.867|TR0|York City in the Bloomberg 
20110107144631.867|20110107144633.488|TR0|administration. And he knows -
20110107144633.488|20110107144635.109|TR0|
20110107144635.109|20110107144636.730|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And Juan really 
20110107144636.730|20110107144638.351|TR0|exposed this story, the biggest 
20110107144638.351|20110107144639.972|TR0|scandal.

20110107144643.214|20110107144644.835|TR0|right. And when you have a story 
20110107144644.835|20110107144646.456|TR0|like that, you know, which so 
20110107144646.456|20110107144648.077|TR0|materially affects the politics 
20110107144648.077|20110107144649.697|TR0|of a city in such a fundamental 
20110107144649.697|20110107144651.318|TR0|way - and I've had a few of 
20110107144651.318|20110107144652.939|TR0|those - you know, there just 
20110107144652.939|20110107144654.560|TR0|isn't a greater reward than 
20110107144654.560|20110107144656.181|TR0|that. The story is the thing, as 
20110107144656.181|20110107144657.802|TR0|Juan knows and you know. And it 
20110107144657.802|20110107144659.423|TR0|just - it makes you live and 
20110107144659.423|20110107144701.044|TR0|breathe, a good story. And I 
20110107144701.044|20110107144702.665|TR0|hope to write a few more, but 
20110107144702.665|20110107144704.286|TR0|I've loved writing the ones I've 
20110107144704.286|20110107144705.907|TR0|written so far.

20110107144710.770|20110107144712.391|TR0|you go, but we know you're going 
20110107144712.391|20110107144714.012|TR0|to resurrect yourself in a new

20110107144744.811|20110107144746.432|TR0|week will mark the ninth 
20110107144746.432|20110107144748.053|TR0|anniversary of the first

20110107144752.916|20110107144754.536|TR0|comes another important 
20110107144754.536|20110107144756.157|TR0|milestone: one year since 
20110107144756.157|20110107144757.778|TR0|President Obama's promised 
20110107144757.778|20110107144759.399|TR0|deadline to shut the prison 
20110107144759.399|20110107144801.020|TR0|down. Shortly after coming into 
20110107144801.020|20110107144802.641|TR0|office in January 2009, Obama 
20110107144802.641|20110107144804.262|TR0|pledged to close Guantanamo no

20110107144835.061|20110107144836.682|TR0|after Obama's pledge, 173 people 
20110107144836.682|20110107144838.303|TR0|are still imprisoned in 
20110107144838.303|20110107144839.924|TR0|Guantanamo. The military's 
20110107144839.924|20110107144841.545|TR0|Guantanamo Review Task Force has 
20110107144841.545|20110107144843.166|TR0|cleared around 90 for release, 
20110107144843.166|20110107144844.787|TR0|but their future remains 
20110107144844.787|20110107144846.408|TR0|uncertain. Last month, Congress 
20110107144846.408|20110107144848.029|TR0|passed legislation that would 
20110107144848.029|20110107144849.650|TR0|effectively bar the transfer of 
20110107144849.650|20110107144851.271|TR0|Guantanamo prisoners to the 
20110107144851.271|20110107144852.892|TR0|United States for trial. The 
20110107144852.892|20110107144854.513|TR0|bill also bans the purchase or

20110107144856.134|20110107144857.755|TR0|inside the U.S. to hold current

20110107144902.617|20110107144904.238|TR0|reports emerged President Obama 
20110107144904.238|20110107144905.859|TR0|is preparing to sign an 
20110107144905.859|20110107144907.480|TR0|executive order this year that 
20110107144907.480|20110107144909.101|TR0|would establish the government's 
20110107144909.101|20110107144910.722|TR0|right to indefinitely detain 
20110107144910.722|20110107144912.343|TR0|prisoners without charge or 
20110107144912.343|20110107144913.964|TR0|trial. According to ProPublica, 
20110107144913.964|20110107144915.585|TR0|the administration is expected 
20110107144915.585|20110107144917.206|TR0|to indefinitely hold at least 48 
20110107144917.206|20110107144918.827|TR0|Guantanamo prisoners. That means 
20110107144918.827|20110107144920.448|TR0|more Guantanamo prisoners are 
20110107144920.448|20110107144922.069|TR0|now formally facing the prospect 
20110107144922.069|20110107144923.690|TR0|of lifelong detention, and fewer 
20110107144923.690|20110107144925.311|TR0|are facing charges than the day 
20110107144925.311|20110107144926.932|TR0|Obama was elected.

20110107144948.005|20110107144949.626|TR0|attorney at the Center for 
20110107144949.626|20110107144951.247|TR0|Constitutional Rights. On 
20110107144951.247|20110107144952.868|TR0|Thursday, CCR filed a request 
20110107144952.868|20110107144954.489|TR0|asking a Spanish court to 
20110107144954.489|20110107144956.110|TR0|subpoena the former commanding 
20110107144956.110|20110107144957.731|TR0|officer at Guantanamo, Major 
20110107144957.731|20110107144959.352|TR0|General Geoffrey Miller. The 
20110107144959.352|20110107145000.973|TR0|filing comes in a nearly 
20110107145000.973|20110107145002.594|TR0|two-year Spanish probe of the 
20110107145002.594|20110107145004.214|TR0|alleged torture of four 
20110107145004.214|20110107145005.835|TR0|Guantanamo prisoners. Last 
20110107145005.835|20110107145007.456|TR0|month, CCR also asked another 
20110107145007.456|20110107145009.077|TR0|Spanish judge to prosecute six 
20110107145009.077|20110107145010.698|TR0|former Bush administration 
20110107145010.698|20110107145012.319|TR0|officials who authored the legal

20110107145017.182|20110107145018.803|TR0|WikiLeaks show that the Obama 
20110107145018.803|20110107145020.424|TR0|administration is pressuring the 
20110107145020.424|20110107145022.045|TR0|Spanish government to drop an 
20110107145022.045|20110107145023.666|TR0|investigation into the

20110107145033.392|20110107145035.013|TR0|let's begin with you. You'll be 
20110107145035.013|20110107145036.634|TR0|in front of the White House 
20110107145036.634|20110107145038.255|TR0|Tuesday on the ninth anniversary 
20110107145038.255|20110107145039.876|TR0|of Guantanamo. It isn't closed. 
20110107145039.876|20110107145041.497|TR0|President Obama promised two 
20110107145041.497|20110107145043.118|TR0|years ago it would be within a 
20110107145043.118|20110107145044.739|TR0|year.
20110107145044.739|20110107145046.360|TR0|
20110107145046.360|20110107145047.981|TR0|>> ANDY WORTHINGTON: Yeah, and 
20110107145047.981|20110107145049.602|TR0|it's looking - you know, it's 
20110107145049.602|20110107145051.223|TR0|looking very bad, actually, at 
20110107145051.223|20110107145052.844|TR0|the moment. It's looking like we 
20110107145052.844|20110107145054.465|TR0|have the possibility that very 
20110107145054.465|20110107145056.086|TR0|few prisoners at all will be 
20110107145056.086|20110107145057.707|TR0|released, you know, before the 
20110107145057.707|20110107145059.328|TR0|2012 elections. And what a 
20110107145059.328|20110107145100.949|TR0|horrible climb down from the 
20110107145100.949|20110107145102.570|TR0|great optimism that we had at 
20110107145102.570|20110107145104.191|TR0|the start of Obama's presidency.
20110107145104.191|20110107145105.812|TR0|
20110107145105.812|20110107145107.433|TR0|And so, there are the specific 
20110107145107.433|20110107145109.053|TR0|issues. The problems with the 
20110107145109.053|20110107145110.674|TR0|cleared prisoners, I think, is 
20110107145110.674|20110107145112.295|TR0|very, very important, that a 
20110107145112.295|20110107145113.916|TR0|task force established by the 
20110107145113.916|20110107145115.537|TR0|President of representatives of 
20110107145115.537|20110107145117.158|TR0|government departments, of the 
20110107145117.158|20110107145118.779|TR0|agencies - careful, sober people 
20110107145118.779|20110107145120.400|TR0|examining the cases of the men - 
20110107145120.400|20110107145122.021|TR0|said that 90 of them should be 
20110107145122.021|20110107145123.642|TR0|released. Now, 58 of these are 
20110107145123.642|20110107145125.263|TR0|Yemenis, and it's been a year 
20110107145125.263|20110107145126.884|TR0|now since the President 
20110107145126.884|20110107145128.505|TR0|announced a moratorium on 
20110107145128.505|20110107145130.126|TR0|releasing any prisoner from 
20110107145130.126|20110107145131.747|TR0|Guantanamo to Yemen because of 
20110107145131.747|20110107145133.368|TR0|the uproar that came about 
20110107145133.368|20110107145134.989|TR0|because Christmas 2009, a 
20110107145134.989|20110107145136.610|TR0|Nigerian man tried to blow up a 
20110107145136.610|20110107145138.231|TR0|plane, and it was - it came out 
20110107145138.231|20110107145139.852|TR0|that he was apparently recruited 
20110107145139.852|20110107145141.473|TR0|in Yemen. So Yemen is now this 
20110107145141.473|20110107145143.094|TR0|entire terrorist country. Nobody 
20110107145143.094|20110107145144.715|TR0|cleared for release from 
20110107145144.715|20110107145146.336|TR0|Guantanamo can be released there 
20110107145146.336|20110107145147.957|TR0|because of these fears that they 
20110107145147.957|20110107145149.578|TR0|will join some terrorist cell. 
20110107145149.578|20110107145151.199|TR0|That's guilt by nationality. 
20110107145151.199|20110107145152.820|TR0|It's collective punishment. 
20110107145152.820|20110107145154.441|TR0|However you want to look at it, 
20110107145154.441|20110107145156.062|TR0|it's grossly unfair. And so, 
20110107145156.062|20110107145157.683|TR0|that's a very important aspect.
20110107145157.683|20110107145159.304|TR0|
20110107145159.304|20110107145200.925|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And then there 
20110107145200.925|20110107145202.546|TR0|are some of these prisoners who 
20110107145202.546|20110107145204.167|TR0|the government wants to release, 
20110107145204.167|20110107145205.788|TR0|but they fear going back to the 
20110107145205.788|20110107145207.409|TR0|countries that they're being 
20110107145207.409|20110107145209.030|TR0|sent to. One just released 
20110107145209.030|20110107145210.651|TR0|apparently - or sent back to 
20110107145210.651|20110107145212.272|TR0|Algeria, Saiid Farhi, in the 
20110107145212.272|20110107145213.892|TR0|last few days?
20110107145213.892|20110107145215.513|TR0|
20110107145215.513|20110107145217.134|TR0|>> ANDY WORTHINGTON: That's 
20110107145217.134|20110107145218.755|TR0|right, yeah. And, I mean, his 
20110107145218.755|20110107145220.376|TR0|case is - you know, that's a 
20110107145220.376|20110107145221.997|TR0|black mark for the government, 
20110107145221.997|20110107145223.618|TR0|as well. You know, he was 
20110107145223.618|20110107145225.239|TR0|actually appealing against the 
20110107145225.239|20110107145226.860|TR0|government's right to send him 
20110107145226.860|20110107145228.481|TR0|back to his home country, that 
20110107145228.481|20110107145230.102|TR0|he didn't want to go back to. A 
20110107145230.102|20110107145231.723|TR0|third country could have been 
20110107145231.723|20110107145233.344|TR0|found for this man. But the 
20110107145233.344|20110107145234.965|TR0|Obama administration has 
20110107145234.965|20110107145236.586|TR0|demonstrated that Algeria is a 
20110107145236.586|20110107145238.207|TR0|country it wants to send people 
20110107145238.207|20110107145239.828|TR0|back to.
20110107145239.828|20110107145241.449|TR0|
20110107145241.449|20110107145243.070|TR0|But there are other men still 
20110107145243.070|20110107145244.691|TR0|waiting in Guantanamo for third 
20110107145244.691|20110107145246.312|TR0|countries to be found who will 
20110107145246.312|20110107145247.933|TR0|take them. We saw in the 
20110107145247.933|20110107145249.554|TR0|WikiLeaks cables some examples 
20110107145249.554|20110107145251.175|TR0|of the kind of rather 
20110107145251.175|20110107145252.796|TR0|undignified horse trading that 
20110107145252.796|20110107145254.417|TR0|had been taking place of trying 
20110107145254.417|20110107145256.038|TR0|to persuade other countries to 
20110107145256.038|20110107145257.659|TR0|take them. You know, it still 
20110107145257.659|20110107145259.280|TR0|remains a problem that, at every 
20110107145259.280|20110107145300.901|TR0|level, at the highest levels of 
20110107145300.901|20110107145302.522|TR0|government in the United States, 
20110107145302.522|20110107145304.143|TR0|everybody who could - the 
20110107145304.143|20110107145305.764|TR0|courts, Congress, President 
20110107145305.764|20110107145307.385|TR0|Obama - refused to accept 
20110107145307.385|20110107145309.006|TR0|cleared prisoners to be brought 
20110107145309.006|20110107145310.627|TR0|and live in the U.S. mainland.

20110107145315.490|20110107145317.111|TR0|which of course are U.S. 
20110107145317.111|20110107145318.731|TR0|diplomatic cables, what have you 
20110107145318.731|20110107145320.352|TR0|learned?
20110107145320.352|20110107145321.973|TR0|
20110107145321.973|20110107145323.594|TR0|>> KATHERINE GALLAGHER: What we 
20110107145323.594|20110107145325.215|TR0|saw last month, in the case of 
20110107145325.215|20110107145326.836|TR0|our Spanish investigation, is 
20110107145326.836|20110107145328.457|TR0|that the U.S., which has had - 
20110107145328.457|20110107145330.078|TR0|the Obama administration, which 
20110107145330.078|20110107145331.699|TR0|has had a policy of really 
20110107145331.699|20110107145333.320|TR0|ensuring impunity for Bush 
20110107145333.320|20110107145334.941|TR0|administration officials, 
20110107145334.941|20110107145336.562|TR0|exported that policy to Spain 
20110107145336.562|20110107145338.183|TR0|and did everything it could 
20110107145338.183|20110107145339.804|TR0|through diplomatic, political 
20110107145339.804|20110107145341.425|TR0|pressure to ensure that the 
20110107145341.425|20110107145343.046|TR0|investigations undertaken in 
20110107145343.046|20110107145344.667|TR0|Spain would be closed, that no 
20110107145344.667|20110107145346.288|TR0|U.S. official from the Bush 
20110107145346.288|20110107145347.909|TR0|administration would face 
20110107145347.909|20110107145349.530|TR0|justice, investigation, 
20110107145349.530|20110107145351.151|TR0|prosecution anywhere, especially 
20110107145351.151|20110107145352.772|TR0|in Spain, where there is a 
20110107145352.772|20110107145354.393|TR0|viable investigation ongoing.

20110107145359.256|20110107145400.877|TR0|demanding right now?

20110107145402.498|20110107145404.119|TR0|>> KATHERINE GALLAGHER: Right 
20110107145404.119|20110107145405.740|TR0|now we've asked the Spanish 
20110107145405.740|20110107145407.361|TR0|judge, Judge Ruz, who's 
20110107145407.361|20110107145408.982|TR0|overseeing the investigation, to 
20110107145408.982|20110107145410.603|TR0|subpoena Geoffrey Miller and to 
20110107145410.603|20110107145412.224|TR0|finally have the former 
20110107145412.224|20110107145413.845|TR0|commander of Guantanamo explain 
20110107145413.845|20110107145415.466|TR0|exactly what was happening in 
20110107145415.466|20110107145417.087|TR0|Guantanamo and his role in the 
20110107145417.087|20110107145418.708|TR0|torture and abuse of Guantanamo 
20110107145418.708|20110107145420.329|TR0|detainees, including Mohammed

20110107145423.570|20110107145425.191|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, and the 
20110107145425.191|20110107145426.812|TR0|revelations in the WikiLeaks 
20110107145426.812|20110107145428.433|TR0|cables that the chief prosecutor 
20110107145428.433|20110107145430.054|TR0|in Spain was actually in direct 
20110107145430.054|20110107145431.675|TR0|communication with U.S. 
20110107145431.675|20110107145433.296|TR0|officials, and, in essence, 
20110107145433.296|20110107145434.917|TR0|trying to fix the system, has 
20110107145434.917|20110107145436.538|TR0|been a huge story in Spain, 
20110107145436.538|20110107145438.159|TR0|while it got almost no attention 
20110107145438.159|20110107145439.780|TR0|here.
20110107145439.780|20110107145441.401|TR0|
20110107145441.401|20110107145443.022|TR0|>> KATHERINE GALLAGHER: Yes, and 
20110107145443.022|20110107145444.643|TR0|the filings that we did 
20110107145444.643|20110107145446.264|TR0|yesterday are front-page news 
20110107145446.264|20110107145447.885|TR0|already today in Spain. It's 
20110107145447.885|20110107145449.506|TR0|unfortunate that this isn't 
20110107145449.506|20110107145451.127|TR0|getting covered in the United 
20110107145451.127|20110107145452.748|TR0|States. It's more than 
20110107145452.748|20110107145454.369|TR0|unfortunate; it's deeply 
20110107145454.369|20110107145455.990|TR0|disturbing. But there, yes, we 
20110107145455.990|20110107145457.611|TR0|may see people lose their jobs 
20110107145457.611|20110107145459.232|TR0|over the obstruction of justice.

20110107145500.853|20110107145502.474|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, 
20110107145502.474|20110107145504.095|TR0|this is more than going after 
20110107145504.095|20110107145505.716|TR0|General Miller, to trying to get 
20110107145505.716|20110107145507.337|TR0|him to talk.

20110107145512.200|20110107145513.821|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You're talking 
20110107145513.821|20110107145515.442|TR0|about going after the so-called 
20110107145515.442|20110107145517.063|TR0|Bush Six. Explain, and how the 
20110107145517.063|20110107145518.684|TR0|Obama - not the Bush 
20110107145518.684|20110107145520.305|TR0|administration, but the Obama 
20110107145520.305|20110107145521.926|TR0|administration - has responded?
20110107145521.926|20110107145523.547|TR0|
20110107145523.547|20110107145525.168|TR0|>> KATHERINE GALLAGHER: Sure. 
20110107145525.168|20110107145526.789|TR0|Officially, the Obama 
20110107145526.789|20110107145528.409|TR0|administration has said nothing 
20110107145528.409|20110107145530.030|TR0|about this case against the 
20110107145530.030|20110107145531.651|TR0|so-called Bush Six - six lawyers 
20110107145531.651|20110107145533.272|TR0|from the Bush administration who 
20110107145533.272|20110107145534.893|TR0|were the authors of the torture 
20110107145534.893|20110107145536.514|TR0|memos, the architects behind the 
20110107145536.514|20110107145538.135|TR0|scenes of the torture program, 
20110107145538.135|20110107145539.756|TR0|giving legal cover for what we 
20110107145539.756|20110107145541.377|TR0|saw happen in Guantanamo and Abu 
20110107145541.377|20110107145542.998|TR0|Ghraib and in Afghanistan. So, 
20110107145542.998|20110107145544.619|TR0|publicly, they have not 
20110107145544.619|20110107145546.240|TR0|responded to this case. Behind 
20110107145546.240|20110107145547.861|TR0|the scenes, we see that there 
20110107145547.861|20110107145549.482|TR0|were calls and meetings to 
20110107145549.482|20110107145551.103|TR0|diplomats in Spain, to the

20110107145557.587|20110107145559.208|TR0|Spain, and that U.S. members of

20110107145600.829|20110107145602.450|TR0|having meetings in Spain under 
20110107145602.450|20110107145604.071|TR0|the Bush - under the Obama 
20110107145604.071|20110107145605.692|TR0|administration, saying, "Halt 
20110107145605.692|20110107145607.313|TR0|this prosecution. It's not good 
20110107145607.313|20110107145608.934|TR0|for bilateral relations."
20110107145608.934|20110107145610.555|TR0|
20110107145610.555|20110107145612.176|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And although a 
20110107145612.176|20110107145613.797|TR0|judge has demanded that the 
20110107145613.797|20110107145615.418|TR0|Obama administration respond, 
20110107145615.418|20110107145617.039|TR0|they have not? They're just 
20110107145617.039|20110107145618.660|TR0|completely ignoring the 
20110107145618.660|20110107145620.281|TR0|subpoenas?
20110107145620.281|20110107145621.902|TR0|
20110107145621.902|20110107145623.523|TR0|>> KATHERINE GALLAGHER: Yes. 
20110107145623.523|20110107145625.144|TR0|Well, there haven't been 
20110107145625.144|20110107145626.765|TR0|subpoenas, but there have been 
20110107145626.765|20110107145628.386|TR0|three requests, sent by one 
20110107145628.386|20110107145630.007|TR0|judge, saying, "Look, are 
20110107145630.007|20110107145631.628|TR0|investigating this, or should I 
20110107145631.628|20110107145633.248|TR0|proceed?" And the Obama 
20110107145633.248|20110107145634.869|TR0|administration has been silent. 
20110107145634.869|20110107145636.490|TR0|So, hopefully, at this point, 
20110107145636.490|20110107145638.111|TR0|the judge will say, "I'm moving 
20110107145638.111|20110107145639.732|TR0|forward."
20110107145639.732|20110107145641.353|TR0|
20110107145641.353|20110107145642.974|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Andy, the 
20110107145642.974|20110107145644.595|TR0|implications for the Obama 
20110107145644.595|20110107145646.216|TR0|administration that it's 
20110107145646.216|20110107145647.837|TR0|entirely possible that four 
20110107145647.837|20110107145649.458|TR0|years after he assumed office 
20110107145649.458|20110107145651.079|TR0|that Guantanamo will still be 
20110107145651.079|20110107145652.700|TR0|open and holding prisoners?
20110107145652.700|20110107145654.321|TR0|
20110107145654.321|20110107145655.942|TR0|>> ANDY WORTHINGTON: Yeah. Well, 
20110107145655.942|20110107145657.563|TR0|I mean, that's very much what it 
20110107145657.563|20110107145659.184|TR0|looks like. I mean, you know, I 
20110107145659.184|20110107145700.805|TR0|think there's a big problem with 
20110107145700.805|20110107145702.426|TR0|this notion of 48 men who his 
20110107145702.426|20110107145704.047|TR0|task force said could be held 
20110107145704.047|20110107145705.668|TR0|indefinitely without charge or 
20110107145705.668|20110107145707.289|TR0|trial. On the face of it, if you 
20110107145707.289|20110107145708.910|TR0|don't examine it, it's like, OK, 
20110107145708.910|20110107145710.531|TR0|they're saying they're 
20110107145710.531|20110107145712.152|TR0|dangerous, they don't have the 
20110107145712.152|20110107145713.773|TR0|evidence. What does that mean? 
20110107145713.773|20110107145715.394|TR0|One worry is that the evidence 
20110107145715.394|20110107145717.015|TR0|that - the supposed evidence 
20110107145717.015|20110107145718.636|TR0|that they've been relying on is 
20110107145718.636|20110107145720.257|TR0|actually not trustworthy. I 
20110107145720.257|20110107145721.878|TR0|mean, this is such a fundamental 
20110107145721.878|20110107145723.499|TR0|problem with the Guantanamo 
20110107145723.499|20110107145725.120|TR0|evidence, is that it's been 
20110107145725.120|20110107145726.741|TR0|tortured out of people.
20110107145726.741|20110107145728.362|TR0|
20110107145728.362|20110107145729.983|TR0|But it's also - it's in conflict 
20110107145729.983|20110107145731.604|TR0|with something that's also been 
20110107145731.604|20110107145733.225|TR0|proceeding for all these years, 
20110107145733.225|20110107145734.846|TR0|which is the legal cases, the 
20110107145734.846|20110107145736.467|TR0|prisoners' own habeas corpus 
20110107145736.467|20110107145738.087|TR0|petitions. And these prisoners 
20110107145738.087|20110107145739.708|TR0|have habeas corpus petitions 
20110107145739.708|20110107145741.329|TR0|ongoing. Many of them have not 
20110107145741.329|20110107145742.950|TR0|had their cases heard by a 
20110107145742.950|20110107145744.571|TR0|judge. And yet, there are these 
20110107145744.571|20110107145746.192|TR0|48 designated for indefinite 
20110107145746.192|20110107145747.813|TR0|detention, which kind of 
20110107145747.813|20110107145749.434|TR0|preempts the legal process.
20110107145749.434|20110107145751.055|TR0|
20110107145751.055|20110107145752.676|TR0|And also I think we'll find, if 
20110107145752.676|20110107145754.297|TR0|people are able to examine it, 
20110107145754.297|20110107145755.918|TR0|that some of these 48 men are 
20110107145755.918|20110107145757.539|TR0|the people who have lost their 
20110107145757.539|20110107145759.160|TR0|habeas petitions. Now, 19 men 
20110107145759.160|20110107145800.781|TR0|have lost their habeas petitions 
20110107145800.781|20110107145802.402|TR0|so far. And most of them, when 
20110107145802.402|20110107145804.023|TR0|you look at what the judges 
20110107145804.023|20110107145805.644|TR0|found out, they were very 
20110107145805.644|20110107145807.265|TR0|peripheral foot soldiers in the 
20110107145807.265|20110107145808.886|TR0|military conflict that preceded 
20110107145808.886|20110107145810.507|TR0|the - took place before the 9/11 
20110107145810.507|20110107145812.128|TR0|attacks, in Afghanistan. These 
20110107145812.128|20110107145813.749|TR0|men are not terrorists.
20110107145813.749|20110107145815.370|TR0|
20110107145815.370|20110107145816.991|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: There will be 
20110107145816.991|20110107145818.612|TR0|protests next week in front of 
20110107145818.612|20110107145820.233|TR0|the White House on Tuesday?

20110107145821.854|20110107145823.475|TR0|>> ANDY WORTHINGTON: Absolutely, 
20110107145823.475|20110107145825.096|TR0|yeah.
20110107145825.096|20110107145826.717|TR0|
20110107145826.717|20110107145828.338|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And that's where 
20110107145828.338|20110107145829.959|TR0|you'll be?
20110107145829.959|20110107145831.580|TR0|
20110107145831.580|20110107145833.201|TR0|>> ANDY WORTHINGTON: And there's 
20110107145833.201|20110107145834.822|TR0|a screening of my film, Outside
