20110107230021.000|20110107230024.000|CC1|AND HIS PARENTS WERE GROOMED.

20110107230045.000|20110107230046.000|CC1|DANIEL WAS SITTING IN A JAIL

20110107230051.000|20110107230054.000|CC1|MOLESTED HIM. THE JUDGE IN THE  
20110107230054.000|20110107230055.000|CC1|CASE ALLOWED DANIEL TO BE HERE  
20110107230055.000|20110107230057.000|CC1|TODAY FOR HIS FIRST INTERVIEW,  
20110107230057.000|20110107230059.000|CC1|AND THAT DECISION HAS CAUSED    
20110107230059.000|20110107230100.000|CC1|SOME CONTROVERSY IN CLEVELAND,  
20110107230100.000|20110107230102.000|CC1|WHERE DANIEL IS FROM. BUT JUDGE

20110107230105.000|20110107230109.000|CC1|BECAUSE, AND I QUOTE HIM, "IF WE

20110107230119.000|20110107230120.000|CC1|HORRIBLE DEATH, IT WOULD BE A

20110107230121.000|20110107230123.000|CC1|WORTH MAKING." THANK YOU, JUDGE.
20110107230123.000|20110107230124.000|CC1|HERE IS DANIEL'S STORY. JANUARY 
20110107230124.000|20110107230126.000|CC1|22, 2010, STARTED AS A TYPICAL  
20110107230126.000|20110107230128.000|CC1|FRIDAY AT THE KOVARBASICH       
20110107230128.000|20110107230130.000|CC1|HOME.                           
20110107230130.000|20110107230131.000|CC1|>> IT STARTED OUT NORMAL, BUT   
20110107230131.000|20110107230132.000|CC1|LOOKING BACK I ACTUALLY REMEMBER
20110107230132.000|20110107230134.000|CC1|DANIEL SITTING RIGHT THERE      
20110107230134.000|20110107230135.000|CC1|ASKING IF HE COULD JUST STAY    
20110107230135.000|20110107230138.000|CC1|HOME.                           
20110107230138.000|20110107230140.000|CC1|OPRAH: TERRY DROVE HIS WIFE     
20110107230140.000|20110107230141.000|CC1|DONNA TO WORK, AND ON THE WAY,  
20110107230141.000|20110107230142.000|CC1|THEY DROPPED OFF THEIR          
20110107230142.000|20110107230144.000|CC1|16-YEAR-OLD SON AT THE HOME OF  
20110107230144.000|20110107230146.000|CC1|DUANE HURLEY, A FAMILY FRIEND   
20110107230146.000|20110107230148.000|CC1|WHO WAS GOING TO DRIVE DANIEL TO
20110107230148.000|20110107230150.000|CC1|SCHOOL. BUT IN LESS THAN ONE    
20110107230150.000|20110107230151.000|CC1|HOUR, THIS AVERAGE DAY TURNED   
20110107230151.000|20110107230156.000|CC1|INTO A LIVING NIGHTMARE.        
20110107230156.000|20110107230157.000|CC1|>> A HALF-HOUR LATER, I GET A   
20110107230157.000|20110107230159.000|CC1|FRANTIC CALL FROM MY SON. HE'S  
20110107230159.000|20110107230200.000|CC1|FREAKING OUT.                   
20110107230200.000|20110107230202.000|CC1|OPRAH: DANIEL TOLD HIS FATHER TO
20110107230202.000|20110107230204.000|CC1|PICK HIM UP AT DUANE'S NOW.     
20110107230204.000|20110107230205.000|CC1|SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAD HAPPENED.
20110107230205.000|20110107230208.000|CC1|TERRY RACED TO MEET HIS SON.    
20110107230208.000|20110107230210.000|CC1|>> HIS HANDS WERE JUST CAKED    
20110107230210.000|20110107230211.000|CC1|WITH BLOOD. I ASKED HIM, "WHAT  
20110107230211.000|20110107230214.000|CC1|HAPPENED?"                      
20110107230214.000|20110107230217.000|CC1|OPRAH: DANIEL TOLD HIS DAD THAT 
20110107230217.000|20110107230218.000|CC1|DUANE HAD ATTACKED HIM. IN A    
20110107230218.000|20110107230220.000|CC1|STATE OF SHOCK, TERRY ENTERED   
20110107230220.000|20110107230221.000|CC1|DUANE'S HOUSE TO SEE FOR        
20110107230221.000|20110107230224.000|CC1|HIMSELF.                        
20110107230224.000|20110107230228.000|CC1|>> AT THE VERY TOP OF THE STEPS,
20110107230228.000|20110107230230.000|CC1|DUANE WAS LAYING LIFELESS.      
20110107230230.000|20110107230231.000|CC1|>> MY DAD, HE WAS LIKE, "OH, MY 
20110107230231.000|20110107230232.000|CC1|GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY         
20110107230232.000|20110107230233.000|CC1|GOD."                           
20110107230233.000|20110107230234.000|CC1|OPRAH: IT WAS A GRUESOME SCENE. 
20110107230234.000|20110107230237.000|CC1|BLOOD SPLATTERS AND SMEARS      
20110107230237.000|20110107230239.000|CC1|STAINED THE WALLS. DUANE HURLEY 
20110107230239.000|20110107230241.000|CC1|WAS STABBED 55 TIMES. IN A      
20110107230241.000|20110107230243.000|CC1|PANIC, TERRY AND DANIEL DROVE TO
20110107230243.000|20110107230244.000|CC1|DONNA'S WORKPLACE.              
20110107230244.000|20110107230245.000|CC1|>> I COULDN'T GET DANIEL TO     
20110107230245.000|20110107230246.000|CC1|TALK. THEN FINALLY, DANIEL SAYS,
20110107230246.000|20110107230248.000|CC1|"I KILLED A MAN." "WHAT?"       
20110107230248.000|20110107230253.000|CC1|OPRAH: DANIEL TOLD HIS PARENTS  
20110107230253.000|20110107230255.000|CC1|THAT DUANE HAD ATTACKED HIM AND 
20110107230255.000|20110107230258.000|CC1|HE WAS ACTING IN SELF-DEFENSE,  
20110107230258.000|20110107230259.000|CC1|BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED   
20110107230259.000|20110107230301.000|CC1|THE REAL STORY BEGINS MORE THAN 
20110107230301.000|20110107230303.000|CC1|3 YEARS EARLIER WHEN DANIEL WAS 
20110107230303.000|20110107230305.000|CC1|JUST 12 YEARS OLD.              
20110107230305.000|20110107230308.000|CC1|>> RIGHT BEHIND ME IS OUR       
20110107230308.000|20110107230311.000|CC1|ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. MY SON WAS 12
20110107230311.000|20110107230314.000|CC1|YEARS OLD. HE WAS PLAYING WITH A
20110107230314.000|20110107230316.000|CC1|BUNCH OF FRIENDS WHEN DUANE T.  
20110107230316.000|20110107230317.000|CC1|HURLEY APPROACHED HIM WITH HIS  
20110107230317.000|20110107230320.000|CC1|DOG. DANIEL AUTOMATICALLY LOVED 
20110107230320.000|20110107230324.000|CC1|THE DOG.                        
20110107230324.000|20110107230324.000|CC1|OPRAH: DUANE HURLEY WAS A       
20110107230324.000|20110107230325.000|CC1|52-YEAR-OLD BACHELOR WHO LIVED  
20110107230325.000|20110107230326.000|CC1|ABOUT A MILE FROM THE           
20110107230326.000|20110107230329.000|CC1|KOVARBASICH HOME.               
20110107230329.000|20110107230330.000|CC1|>> NEXT TIME I SEEN DUANE WAS   
20110107230330.000|20110107230332.000|CC1|ABOUT A COUPLE DAYS LATER. HE   
20110107230332.000|20110107230333.000|CC1|WAS LIKE, "HEY, CAN YOU WATCH MY
20110107230333.000|20110107230334.000|CC1|DOG FOR ME?" SO I WATCH HIS DOG.
20110107230334.000|20110107230335.000|CC1|HE COMES BACK IN, LIKE, 5       
20110107230335.000|20110107230336.000|CC1|MINUTES. THEN HE HANDS ME, LIKE,
20110107230336.000|20110107230338.000|CC1|$30.                            
20110107230338.000|20110107230340.000|CC1|OPRAH: DANIEL'S PARENTS TAUGHT  
20110107230340.000|20110107230342.000|CC1|HIM TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF         
20110107230342.000|20110107230343.000|CC1|STRANGERS, SO HE WAS A LITTLE   
20110107230343.000|20110107230345.000|CC1|SKEPTICAL AT FIRST.             
20110107230345.000|20110107230346.000|CC1|>> WE GOT THE INFORMATION OFF   
20110107230346.000|20110107230347.000|CC1|THE DOG TAG TO GO LOOK HIM UP   
20110107230347.000|20110107230349.000|CC1|ONLINE TO SEE IF HE WAS A SEX   
20110107230349.000|20110107230350.000|CC1|OFFENDER. MY MOM WAS, LIKE, BIG 
20110107230350.000|20110107230352.000|CC1|ON THAT. WE DIDN'T FIND         
20110107230352.000|20110107230353.000|CC1|ANYTHING, DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.  
20110107230353.000|20110107230354.000|CC1|SO IT KIND OF MADE ME THINK,    
20110107230354.000|20110107230356.000|CC1|LIKE, YOU KNOW, ALL RIGHT, YOU  
20110107230356.000|20110107230358.000|CC1|KNOW, THIS IS A LEGIT DUDE.     
20110107230358.000|20110107230400.000|CC1|>> ONE DAY HE SAID, "DANNY, WHY 
20110107230400.000|20110107230401.000|CC1|DON'T YOU COME BY MY HOUSE AND  
20110107230401.000|20110107230403.000|CC1|YOU CAN WORK FOR ME AND YOU MAKE
20110107230403.000|20110107230404.000|CC1|SOME MONEY."                    
20110107230404.000|20110107230406.000|CC1|>> WE TOLD HIM THAT, "WELL, OK, 
20110107230406.000|20110107230407.000|CC1|YOU CAN GO OVER THERE, BUT WE'RE
20110107230407.000|20110107230409.000|CC1|GONNA GO MEET THIS MAN FIRST."  
20110107230409.000|20110107230412.000|CC1|DUANE WELCOMED US INTO HIS HOME.
20110107230412.000|20110107230413.000|CC1|HE SEEMED VERY GENUINE, AND FOR 
20110107230413.000|20110107230416.000|CC1|ALMOST A YEAR, EVERY TIME DANIEL
20110107230416.000|20110107230418.000|CC1|WOULD GO OVER THERE, MY WIFE AND
20110107230418.000|20110107230420.000|CC1|I WOULD GO WITH HIM. THEN...WE  
20110107230420.000|20110107230423.000|CC1|LET HIM IN. HE WAS PART OF THE  
20110107230423.000|20110107230427.000|CC1|FAMILY AFTER THAT.              
20110107230427.000|20110107230428.000|CC1|OPRAH: ABOUT A YEAR INTO THE    
20110107230428.000|20110107230431.000|CC1|FRIENDSHIP, DANIEL SAYS THINGS  
20110107230431.000|20110107230434.000|CC1|BEGAN TO CHANGE.                
20110107230434.000|20110107230435.000|CC1|>> AT FIRST, WHEN HE'D SAY STUFF
20110107230435.000|20110107230436.000|CC1|LIKE, YOU KNOW, "HEY, HOW MANY  
20110107230436.000|20110107230437.000|CC1|DIFFERENT WAYS CAN YOU SAY THE  
20110107230437.000|20110107230440.000|CC1|WORD PENIS?" WELL, I'D BE USING 
20110107230440.000|20110107230441.000|CC1|THE BATHROOM. HE'D WALK BY, OPEN
20110107230441.000|20110107230442.000|CC1|THE DOOR, YOU KNOW, AND LIKE, I 
20110107230442.000|20110107230444.000|CC1|MEAN, I'D CATCH HIM CATCHING A  
20110107230444.000|20110107230445.000|CC1|GLIMPSE OF ME, AND THEN HE'D PEE
20110107230445.000|20110107230447.000|CC1|WITH THE DOOR OPEN.             
20110107230447.000|20110107230451.000|CC1|OPRAH: DANIEL WAS NOW A TEENAGER
20110107230451.000|20110107230453.000|CC1|WHO WAS INTERESTED IN GIRLS AND 
20110107230453.000|20110107230455.000|CC1|LOVED CARS, BUT HE WASN'T OLD   
20110107230455.000|20110107230457.000|CC1|ENOUGH TO DRIVE LEGALLY.        
20110107230457.000|20110107230459.000|CC1|>> HE HAD A DODGE STRATUS, A    
20110107230459.000|20110107230502.000|CC1|CORVETTE, AND A PROWLER. AND    
20110107230502.000|20110107230503.000|CC1|EVENTUALLY AFTER A WHILE, HE    
20110107230503.000|20110107230507.000|CC1|STARTED LETTING ME DRIVE THE    
20110107230507.000|20110107230508.000|CC1|STRATUS. WELL, ONE TIME I WAS   
20110107230508.000|20110107230509.000|CC1|GONNA HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS, 
20110107230509.000|20110107230511.000|CC1|AND THEN I'M LIKE, "LET ME GET  
20110107230511.000|20110107230513.000|CC1|THE KEYS." AND HE'S LIKE, WELL, 
20110107230513.000|20110107230514.000|CC1|PULLS OUT HIS KEYS. HE'S LIKE,  
20110107230514.000|20110107230516.000|CC1|"GOTTA SHOW ME YOUR PENIS       
20110107230516.000|20110107230516.000|CC1|FIRST." AND I WAS IN A HURRY,   
20110107230516.000|20110107230518.000|CC1|AND I'M LIKE, "JUST GIVE ME YOUR
20110107230518.000|20110107230518.000|CC1|KEYS." AND THEN HE WAS LIKE,    
20110107230518.000|20110107230520.000|CC1|"NO. YOU REALLY GOTTA, LIKE, YOU
20110107230520.000|20110107230523.000|CC1|REALLY GOT TO SHOW ME YOUR      
20110107230523.000|20110107230523.000|CC1|PENIS." I'M LIKE, WHATEVER.     
20110107230523.000|20110107230525.000|CC1|WHIPPED OUT MY JOHNSON. THEN HE 
20110107230525.000|20110107230526.000|CC1|WANTED TO TOUCH MY GENITALS.    
20110107230526.000|20110107230528.000|CC1|AFTER THE TOUCHING AND STUFF,   
20110107230528.000|20110107230531.000|CC1|THEN I WANTED TO DRIVE THE      
20110107230531.000|20110107230533.000|CC1|CORVETTE. HE WAS LIKE, "BIGGER  
20110107230533.000|20110107230536.000|CC1|TOYS, BIGGER THINGS." AND THAT  
20110107230536.000|20110107230537.000|CC1|WAS HIS WAY OF, YOU KNOW, WE GOT
20110107230537.000|20110107230538.000|CC1|TO BUMP THIS UP. WELL, IT       
20110107230538.000|20110107230543.000|CC1|PROGRESSED TO ANAL...A LITTLE   
20110107230543.000|20110107230546.000|CC1|AFTER THAT. I DON'T WANT TO DO  
20110107230546.000|20110107230549.000|CC1|THESE THINGS.                   
20110107230549.000|20110107230551.000|CC1|OPRAH: AFTER MONTHS OF SEXUAL   
20110107230551.000|20110107230553.000|CC1|ABUSE, DANIEL SAYS HE COULDN'T  
20110107230553.000|20110107230554.000|CC1|TAKE IT ANYMORE AND TOLD DUANE  
20110107230554.000|20110107230557.000|CC1|TO STOP.                        
20110107230557.000|20110107230558.000|CC1|>> I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW,    
20110107230558.000|20110107230600.000|CC1|IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.             
20110107230600.000|20110107230602.000|CC1|OPRAH: BUT THE ABUSE CONTINUED. 
20110107230602.000|20110107230604.000|CC1|TWO WEEKS BEFORE HE KILLED      
20110107230604.000|20110107230608.000|CC1|DUANE, DANIEL FELL ASLEEP ON HIS
20110107230608.000|20110107230609.000|CC1|COUCH.                          
20110107230609.000|20110107230610.000|CC1|>> HE ANALLY PENETRATED ME THAT 
20110107230610.000|20110107230612.000|CC1|NIGHT, AND I ACTED LIKE I DIDN'T
20110107230612.000|20110107230613.000|CC1|KNOW. I'M STARTING TO BE MAD.   
20110107230613.000|20110107230615.000|CC1|I'M STARTING TO HATE.           
20110107230615.000|20110107230617.000|CC1|OPRAH: DANIEL HAD BEEN PLANNING 
20110107230617.000|20110107230619.000|CC1|A ROMANTIC ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
20110107230619.000|20110107230621.000|CC1|CELEBRATION WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.
20110107230621.000|20110107230623.000|CC1|DUANE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY.       
20110107230623.000|20110107230624.000|CC1|>> HE SAID, "YOUR ANNIVERSARY'S 
20110107230624.000|20110107230626.000|CC1|GOT TO BE PAID FOR, RIGHT?" I   
20110107230626.000|20110107230627.000|CC1|FELT SICK. I FELT A RUSH. IT ALL
20110107230627.000|20110107230628.000|CC1|JUST POPPED IN MY MIND ALL AT   
20110107230628.000|20110107230630.000|CC1|ONCE, AND SOMEHOW I UNDERSTOOD  
20110107230630.000|20110107230631.000|CC1|EVERYTHING AT ONCE. THIS STUFF  
20110107230631.000|20110107230632.000|CC1|ISN'T GONNA STOP. IT'S GONNA    
20110107230632.000|20110107230634.000|CC1|KEEP HAPPENING, KEEP HAPPENING, 
20110107230634.000|20110107230636.000|CC1|AND THEN I SNAPPED.             
20110107230636.000|20110107230638.000|CC1|OPRAH: SO DANIEL ADMITS TO

20110107231109.000|20110107231110.000|CC1|>> WELL, I DIDN'T REALIZE. YOU  
20110107231110.000|20110107231112.000|CC1|KNOW, THERE WAS MOLESTATION, BUT
20110107231112.000|20110107231113.000|CC1|I WOULDN'T PUT IT AS A SEXUAL   
20110107231113.000|20110107231115.000|CC1|RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE I LOOK AT A

20110107231116.000|20110107231118.000|CC1|BOTH PEOPLE ARE--THEY'RE OK WITH
20110107231118.000|20110107231122.000|CC1|IT, WHICH I WASN'T, SO I JUST   
20110107231122.000|20110107231123.000|CC1|SAID, YOU KNOW, SEXUAL          
20110107231123.000|20110107231127.000|CC1|RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE WHAT--     
20110107231127.000|20110107231127.000|CC1|OPRAH: SEX WAS HAPPENING IN THE 
20110107231127.000|20110107231129.000|CC1|RELATIONSHIP.

20110107231131.000|20110107231132.000|CC1|REALLY GREAT POINT YOU MAKE FOR 
20110107231132.000|20110107231135.000|CC1|ALL KIDS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND

20110107231159.000|20110107231201.000|CC1|CHILD MOLESTER'S TACTIC. WE DID 
20110107231201.000|20110107231202.000|CC1|IT WITH LITTLE KIDS IN THE PARK 
20110107231202.000|20110107231204.000|CC1|WHERE A GUY COME AND SAYS, "CAN 
20110107231204.000|20110107231206.000|CC1|YOU HELP ME FIND MY PUPPY?" OR  
20110107231206.000|20110107231208.000|CC1|"CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF MY PUPPY?"
20110107231208.000|20110107231210.000|CC1|FOR YOU IT WASN'T A PUPPY. IT   
20110107231210.000|20110107231212.000|CC1|WAS ACTUALLY A, YOU KNOW, A DOG,
20110107231212.000|20110107231214.000|CC1|AND THAT'S HOW THE LURE STARTED 
20110107231214.000|20110107231217.000|CC1|FOR YOU. WHAT IS INTERESTING    
20110107231217.000|20110107231220.000|CC1|ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOUR PARENTS,

20110107231240.000|20110107231242.000|CC1|WITH KIDS, BUT I FOUND OUT LATER

20110107231517.000|20110107231520.000|CC1|LOOKING AT ME, AND THEN THAT'S  
20110107231520.000|20110107231522.000|CC1|WHEN I JUST...SNAPPED.          
20110107231522.000|20110107231524.000|CC1|OPRAH: WELL, WHAT DOES SNAPPING 
20110107231524.000|20110107231526.000|CC1|FEEL LIKE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT    
20110107231526.000|20110107231527.000|CC1|THAT MEANS.                     
20110107231527.000|20110107231528.000|CC1|>> I REALIZED HE WAS GONNA KEEP 
20110107231528.000|20110107231529.000|CC1|MOLESTING ME, AND IT'S NOT GONNA
20110107231529.000|20110107231531.000|CC1|STOP. THERE'S NOTHING OBVIOUSLY 
20110107231531.000|20110107231532.000|CC1|I CAN DO OR SAY TO STOP HIM, AND
20110107231532.000|20110107231534.000|CC1|I JUST SEEN THE PICKLE JAR, AND 
20110107231534.000|20110107231536.000|CC1|I JUST PICKED IT UP AND HIT HIM 
20110107231536.000|20110107231537.000|CC1|WITH IT AND                     
20110107231537.000|20110107231541.000|CC1|THEN...[INDISTINCT].            
20110107231541.000|20110107231545.000|CC1|OPRAH: SO DID YOU--HAD YOU NOT  
20110107231545.000|20110107231547.000|CC1|THOUGHT ABOUT EVER, LIKE,       
20110107231547.000|20110107231548.000|CC1|TELLING SOMEBODY OR WHAT WOULD  
20110107231548.000|20110107231551.000|CC1|HAPPEN IF I TOLD SOMEBODY OR HOW
20110107231551.000|20110107231554.000|CC1|I CAN GET MYSELF OUT OF THIS    
20110107231554.000|20110107231556.000|CC1|OTHER THAN ENDING HIS LIFE? HAD 
20110107231556.000|20110107231558.000|CC1|YOU NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?     
20110107231558.000|20110107231559.000|CC1|>> WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT        
20110107231559.000|20110107231600.000|CC1|TELLING, BUT I COULDN'T. I      
20110107231600.000|20110107231602.000|CC1|DIDN'T KNOW HOW, AND I COULDN'T.
20110107231602.000|20110107231603.000|CC1|THE ONLY ONE I COULD TALK TO WAS
20110107231603.000|20110107231604.000|CC1|HIM. BUT I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT   
20110107231604.000|20110107231605.000|CC1|ENDING HIS LIFE OR ANYTHING. I  
20110107231605.000|20110107231606.000|CC1|JUST--                          
20110107231606.000|20110107231609.000|CC1|OPRAH: YEAH. SO WHEN YOU STARTED

20110107231613.000|20110107231614.000|CC1|>> YEAH.                        
20110107231614.000|20110107231615.000|CC1|OPRAH: DID YOU REALIZE THAT YOU 
20110107231615.000|20110107231616.000|CC1|HAD STABBED HIM THAT MANY       
20110107231616.000|20110107231618.000|CC1|TIMES?                          
20110107231618.000|20110107231619.000|CC1|>> NO. I HAD NO IDEA.           
20110107231619.000|20110107231620.000|CC1|OPRAH: AND DO YOU THINK THAT    
20110107231620.000|20110107231623.000|CC1|THAT WAS JUST YOUR RAGE OR--WHAT
20110107231623.000|20110107231627.000|CC1|HAPPENED IN THAT MOMENT?        
20110107231627.000|20110107231628.000|CC1|>> I THINK IT WAS MORE RAGE.    
20110107231628.000|20110107231631.000|CC1|LIKE, I WASN'T THERE THERE.     
20110107231631.000|20110107231633.000|CC1|LIKE, I WAS DOING IT, BUT I WAS,
20110107231633.000|20110107231635.000|CC1|LIKE, SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND THEN I
20110107231635.000|20110107231638.000|CC1|ENDED UP REALIZING, LIKE, I'M   
20110107231638.000|20110107231640.000|CC1|STABBING HIM, AND THEN I        
20110107231640.000|20110107231643.000|CC1|STOPPED, AND--BUT--             
20110107231643.000|20110107231645.000|CC1|OPRAH: AND WHAT WAS HE          
20110107231645.000|20110107231645.000|CC1|DOING?                          
20110107231645.000|20110107231646.000|CC1|>> HE WAS JUST LAYING THERE AT  
20110107231646.000|20110107231647.000|CC1|THE END.                        
20110107231647.000|20110107231648.000|CC1|OPRAH: DO YOU HAVE REMORSE?     
20110107231648.000|20110107231650.000|CC1|>> I DO ON SOME EXTENT. I MEAN,

20110107231653.000|20110107231655.000|CC1|I MEAN, I DON'T FEEL GREAT FOR  
20110107231655.000|20110107231656.000|CC1|KILLING SOMEONE. I KNOW THAT'S  
20110107231656.000|20110107231659.000|CC1|WRONG. I FEEL RELIEVED, THOUGH, 
20110107231659.000|20110107231702.000|CC1|NOW IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT  
20110107231702.000|20110107231703.000|CC1|I'M SAYING. I FEEL RELIEVED     
20110107231703.000|20110107231705.000|CC1|BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS DONE BUT I
20110107231705.000|20110107231707.000|CC1|FEEL BAD TO AN EXTENT.          
20110107231707.000|20110107231710.000|CC1|OPRAH: SO DANIEL COULD HAVE

20110107232144.000|20110107232146.000|CC1|>> YES. WE WERE ALL BEING       
20110107232146.000|20110107232148.000|CC1|GROOMED. IT'S LIKE HE WAS AN

20110107234910.000|20110107234912.000|CC1|>> AND YOU HEAR HIM WHEN HE'S   
20110107234912.000|20110107234913.000|CC1|TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S 
20110107234913.000|20110107234914.000|CC1|HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS TAKEN TO  
20110107234914.000|20110107234915.000|CC1|PRISON. REALLY SEEMED LIKE THAT 
20110107234915.000|20110107234915.000|CC1|WAS THE TURNING POINT IN HIS    
20110107234915.000|20110107234916.000|CC1|LIFE.                           
20110107234916.000|20110107234917.000|CC1|>> THAT WAS A HUGE TURNING      
20110107234917.000|20110107234920.000|CC1|POINT. THAT'S WHEN HIS WORLD    
20110107234920.000|20110107234921.000|CC1|KIND OF STOPPED AND HE WAS AT A 
20110107234921.000|20110107234924.000|CC1|CROSSROADS AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT 
20110107234924.000|20110107234926.000|CC1|TO DO. HE WAS LOST. HE WAS A    
20110107234926.000|20110107234927.000|CC1|LITTLE BOY THAT WAS LOST AND    
20110107234927.000|20110107234929.000|CC1|ALONE. THAT WAS RIGHT BEFORE WE

20110107234931.000|20110107234932.000|CC1|OPRAH: SO, DAN, WHAT WAS YOUR   
20110107234932.000|20110107234933.000|CC1|IMPRESSION OF HOW WILLY IS      
20110107234933.000|20110107234935.000|CC1|NOW?                            
20110107234935.000|20110107234935.000|CC1|>> WELL, VERY OFTEN WHEN I'LL   
20110107234935.000|20110107234936.000|CC1|INTERVIEW SOMEONE IN PRISON,    
20110107234936.000|20110107234938.000|CC1|THEY'LL EITHER BLAME OTHER      
20110107234938.000|20110107234939.000|CC1|PEOPLE OR THEY'LL BE ANGRY, OR  
20110107234939.000|20110107234941.000|CC1|THEY'LL TALK ABOUT THEIR        
20110107234941.000|20110107234942.000|CC1|INNOCENCE, ET CETERA. WILLY     
20110107234942.000|20110107234943.000|CC1|DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT. HE WAS   
20110107234943.000|20110107234945.000|CC1|REALLY INTROSPECTIVE AND        
20110107234945.000|20110107234946.000|CC1|THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HIS WHOLE LIFE 
20110107234946.000|20110107234950.000|CC1|AND ABOUT SORT OF THE PATH THAT 
20110107234950.000|20110107234951.000|CC1|HAD LED HIM THERE, AND THAT     
20110107234951.000|20110107234953.000|CC1|REALLY STRUCK ME BECAUSE THERE  
20110107234953.000|20110107234955.000|CC1|WAS NO SENSE OF, "THIS PERSON IS
20110107234955.000|20110107234957.000|CC1|TO BLAME," OR, "THE SYSTEM IS TO
20110107234957.000|20110107234959.000|CC1|BLAME," OR, "I SHOULDN'T BE     
20110107234959.000|20110107235001.000|CC1|HERE." IT WAS REALLY A SORT OF  
20110107235001.000|20110107235003.000|CC1|BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF HOW HE GOT IN
20110107235003.000|20110107235006.000|CC1|THERE AND WHY HE WAS THERE, AND 
20110107235006.000|20110107235007.000|CC1|I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THAT
20110107235007.000|20110107235009.000|CC1|ABILITY.                        
20110107235009.000|20110107235011.000|CC1|OPRAH: WHAT DID HE SAY?         
20110107235011.000|20110107235013.000|CC1|>> HE SAID THAT THE MOLESTATION 
20110107235013.000|20110107235014.000|CC1|STARTED HIM ON THIS PATH, NO    
20110107235014.000|20110107235016.000|CC1|QUESTION. HE SAID IT'S A SCAR   
20110107235016.000|20110107235018.000|CC1|THAT YOU HAVE WITH YOU FOR LIFE 
20110107235018.000|20110107235019.000|CC1|AND NOTHING IT GONNA FIX THAT,  
20110107235019.000|20110107235021.000|CC1|BUT HE WANTED TO MAKE IT REALLY 
20110107235021.000|20110107235022.000|CC1|CLEAR THAT HE FELT THAT HE'D    
20110107235022.000|20110107235024.000|CC1|GOTTEN OVER IT, THAT BY THE TIME
20110107235024.000|20110107235025.000|CC1|HE WAS 12, HE HAD REALLY PRETTY 
20110107235025.000|20110107235028.000|CC1|GIRLFRIENDS. HE WAS REALLY      
20110107235028.000|20110107235030.000|CC1|POPULAR. HE SAID THAT AGAIN AND 
20110107235031.000|20110107235031.000|XDS|% CUR.TIME: 23:59 0/00/1990 UTC
20110107235030.000|20110107235032.000|CC1|AGAIN, AND THE THING THAT REALLY
20110107235032.000|20110107235033.000|CC1|CHANGED HIS LIFE, IT SOUNDS     
20110107235033.000|20110107235036.000|CC1|LIKE, WASN'T NECESSARILY JUST   
20110107235036.000|20110107235039.000|CC1|THE MOLESTATION. IT WAS LOSING  
20110107235039.000|20110107235040.000|CC1|HIS MOTHER AND LOSING HIS       
20110107235040.000|20110107235042.000|CC1|SISTER. WATCHING THESE TWO      
20110107235042.000|20110107235045.000|CC1|TOGETHER IS STRIKING. WE WALKED 
20110107235045.000|20110107235047.000|CC1|IN THERE, AND THE FIRST THING   
20110107235047.000|20110107235048.000|CC1|YOU SEE IS REBECCA TURNING      
20110107235048.000|20110107235049.000|CC1|AROUND AGAIN AND AGAIN WAITING  
20110107235049.000|20110107235051.000|CC1|TO SEE WHEN WILLY IS GONNA GET  
20110107235051.000|20110107235052.000|CC1|THERE. HE WALKS IN, AND THEY    
20110107235052.000|20110107235054.000|CC1|START TALKING TO EACH OTHER AS  
20110107235054.000|20110107235055.000|CC1|IF THEY HAD JUST SEEN EACH OTHER
20110107235055.000|20110107235057.000|CC1|YESTERDAY. THEY HADN'T SEEN EACH
20110107235057.000|20110107235058.000|CC1|OTHER IN TWO YEARS, BUT THEY    
20110107235058.000|20110107235059.000|CC1|FOLLOWED UP ON LETTERS THAT     
20110107235059.000|20110107235101.000|CC1|THEY'D SENT EACH OTHER, AND THEY
20110107235101.000|20110107235102.000|CC1|STARTED TALKING AS IF THE END OF
20110107235102.000|20110107235105.000|CC1|THE LETTER WAS THE BEGINNING OF 
20110107235105.000|20110107235107.000|CC1|THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY WERE 
20110107235107.000|20110107235109.000|CC1|ABOUT TO HAVE, AND IT'S REALLY  
20110107235109.000|20110107235111.000|CC1|STRIKING, AND WHEN YOU TALK TO  
20110107235111.000|20110107235113.000|CC1|WILLY, THAT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT 
20110107235113.000|20110107235114.000|CC1|IT'S ABOUT FAMILY TO HIM.       
20110107235114.000|20110107235115.000|CC1|OPRAH: YEAH. DO YOU THINK WE'VE 
20110107235115.000|20110107235117.000|CC1|PROGRESSED IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE
20110107235117.000|20110107235119.000|CC1|15 YEARS AGO, WHEN THIS MOTHER  
20110107235119.000|20110107235121.000|CC1|WHO FELT THAT SHE COULD GET NO  
20110107235121.000|20110107235125.000|CC1|JUSTICE, THIS CHILD MOLESTER WHO
20110107235125.000|20110107235128.000|CC1|HAD BEEN LET OFF BY A JUDGE AND,
20110107235128.000|20110107235131.000|CC1|FROM HER POINT OF VIEW, SHE FELT
20110107235131.000|20110107235133.000|CC1|WAS GOING TO BE SET FREE OR     
20110107235133.000|20110107235135.000|CC1|ALLOWED TO NOT ONLY CONTINUE    
20110107235135.000|20110107235137.000|CC1|MOLESTING HER CHILD, BUT THE 4  
20110107235137.000|20110107235139.000|CC1|OTHER LITTLE BOYS WHO WERE IN   
20110107235139.000|20110107235140.000|CC1|THAT COURTROOM? HAVE WE         
20110107235140.000|20110107235142.000|CC1|PROGRESSED?                     
20110107235142.000|20110107235144.000|CC1|>> I THINK WE'VE MADE SOME      
20110107235144.000|20110107235145.000|CC1|PROGRESS. WE MADE IT TOUGHER ON 
20110107235145.000|20110107235146.000|CC1|CHILD MOLESTERS, MEANING THEY   
20110107235146.000|20110107235147.000|CC1|HAVE TO REGISTER NOW. THERE ARE 
20110107235147.000|20110107235149.000|CC1|CERTAIN THINGS THAT DIDN'T EXIST
20110107235149.000|20110107235150.000|CC1|BEFORE. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THIS
20110107235150.000|20110107235153.000|CC1|PROBLEM WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED  
20110107235153.000|20110107235154.000|CC1|TODAY? NO, BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT
20110107235154.000|20110107235155.000|CC1|PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.         
20110107235155.000|20110107235157.000|CC1|OPRAH: DID YOU SENSE THAT HE WAS
20110107235157.000|20110107235159.000|CC1|STILL ASHAMED OF THE            
20110107235159.000|20110107235200.000|CC1|MOLESTATION? BECAUSE YOU        
20110107235200.000|20110107235203.000|CC1|MENTIONED THAT HE SAID TO YOU   
20110107235203.000|20110107235205.000|CC1|SEVERAL TIMES, "I HAD PRETTY    
20110107235205.000|20110107235206.000|CC1|GIRLFRIENDS." SO THE MOLESTATION
20110107235206.000|20110107235209.000|CC1|STILL CARRIES THAT SHAME.       
20110107235209.000|20110107235211.000|CC1|>> VERY MUCH SO. HE DIDN'T WANT 
20110107235211.000|20110107235212.000|CC1|TO TALK ABOUT THE MOLESTATION.  
20110107235212.000|20110107235213.000|CC1|HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE
20110107235213.000|20110107235214.000|CC1|REALLY HATED IT WHEN PEOPLE     
20110107235214.000|20110107235215.000|CC1|WOULD POINT HIM OUT AND SAY,    
20110107235215.000|20110107235217.000|CC1|"HEY, THAT'S THE KID WHO WAS    
20110107235217.000|20110107235218.000|CC1|MOLESTED." HIS POINT WAS THAT   
20110107235218.000|20110107235221.000|CC1|HE'D KIND OF MOVED ON, HE'D     
20110107235221.000|20110107235222.000|CC1|MOVED PAST IT, AND THAT ONCE HIS
20110107235222.000|20110107235223.000|CC1|MOTHER BECAME THIS NATIONAL     
20110107235223.000|20110107235226.000|CC1|FIGURE AND HIS LIFE WAS ON      
20110107235226.000|20110107235229.000|CC1|DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD, THAT WAS 
20110107235229.000|20110107235231.000|CC1|THE HARDEST PART FOR HIM.       
20110107235231.000|20110107235233.000|CC1|>> HOW LONG WILL HE BE IN       
20110107235233.000|20110107235235.000|CC1|PRISON?                         
20110107235235.000|20110107235238.000|CC1|>> I THINK IT'S LIKELY HE'S     
20110107235238.000|20110107235240.000|CC1|GONNA BE THERE UNTIL 2031, WHEN 
20110107235240.000|20110107235242.000|CC1|HE'LL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE.   
20110107235242.000|20110107235243.000|CC1|THE FAMILY IS GONNA CONTINUE TO 
20110107235243.000|20110107235245.000|CC1|FIGHT THROUGH THE LEGAL AVENUES,
20110107235245.000|20110107235247.000|CC1|BUT I THINK THAT WILL BE HIS    
20110107235247.000|20110107235250.000|CC1|FIRST OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE,   
20110107235250.000|20110107235252.000|CC1|AND HE SEEMED VERY READY TO DO
