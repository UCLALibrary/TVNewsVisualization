20110107150044.000|20110107150046.000|TR0|warns that Mumbai-style attacks may be 
20110107150046.000|20110107150048.000|TR0|planned in or near London.

20110107150053.000|20110107150055.000|TR0|believes that the road to redemption is 
20110107150055.000|20110107150058.000|TR0|made for TV.  Ted Haggard will appear in a 
20110107150058.000|20110107150100.000|TR0|cable TV special that looks at his 
20110107150100.000|20110107150102.000|TR0|downfall and new beginnings.  Haggard was 
20110107150102.000|20110107150105.000|TR0|booted from his Colorado pulpit after 
20110107150105.000|20110107150107.000|TR0|admitting to illegal drug use and a 
20110107150107.000|20110107150109.000|TR0|relationship with a male prostitute.

20110107150111.000|20110107150114.000|TR0|There are few who feel the brunt of tough 
20110107150114.000|20110107150116.000|TR0|economic times more than our military 
20110107150116.000|20110107150118.000|TR0|families and now, Defense Secretary Robert 
20110107150118.000|20110107150121.000|TR0|Gates announces that the size of that 
20110107150121.000|20110107150123.000|TR0|extended family is about to shrink. $78 
20110107150123.000|20110107150125.000|TR0|billion in cuts to the U.S. military and 
20110107150125.000|20110107150128.000|TR0|the Defense Department and that includes 
20110107150128.000|20110107150130.000|TR0|reducing the size of the Army and Marine 
20110107150130.000|20110107150132.000|TR0|Corps. Secretary Gates says it's time to 
20110107150132.000|20110107150135.000|TR0|get away from a culture of endless money.
20110107150135.000|20110107150137.000|TR0|
20110107150137.000|20110107150139.000|TR0|The new House Armed Services committee 
20110107150139.000|20110107150142.000|TR0|chairman seems to see this more of culture 
20110107150142.000|20110107150144.000|TR0|shock.  Congressman Howard McKeon - he had 
20110107150144.000|20110107150146.000|TR0|shot back at the administration saying 
20110107150146.000|20110107150149.000|TR0|"I'm not happy, I remain committed to 
20110107150149.000|20110107150151.000|TR0|applying more fiscal responsibility and 
20110107150151.000|20110107150153.000|TR0|accountability to the Department of 
20110107150153.000|20110107150156.000|TR0|Defense, but I will not stand by and watch 
20110107150156.000|20110107150158.000|TR0|the White House gut defense when Americans 
20110107150158.000|20110107150200.000|TR0|are deployed in harm's way."

20110107150203.000|20110107150205.000|TR0|Barbara Starr joining us live from 
20110107150205.000|20110107150207.000|TR0|Washington.  So first off, Barbara, what 
20110107150207.000|20110107150210.000|TR0|prompted the cuts?
20110107150210.000|20110107150212.000|TR0|
20110107150212.000|20110107150214.000|TR0|BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: 
20110107150214.000|20110107150216.000|TR0| Well, you know, Kyra, basically, tough 
20110107150216.000|20110107150219.000|TR0|economic times.  A recessionary economy, 
20110107150219.000|20110107150221.000|TR0|if not a full blown recession.  The 
20110107150221.000|20110107150223.000|TR0|Pentagon is not immune to any of that.  So 
20110107150223.000|20110107150226.000|TR0|the White House told the Pentagon, come up 
20110107150226.000|20110107150228.000|TR0|with $78 million in budget cuts.  
20110107150228.000|20110107150230.000|TR0|Secretary Gates had the services and the 
20110107150230.000|20110107150233.000|TR0|department identify about $154 billion in 
20110107150233.000|20110107150235.000|TR0|cost savings.
20110107150235.000|20110107150237.000|TR0|
20110107150237.000|20110107150240.000|TR0|What do all these numbers really mean?  
20110107150240.000|20110107150242.000|TR0|What does it really all add up to?  Gates 
20110107150242.000|20110107150244.000|TR0|is talking about making a fundamental 
20110107150244.000|20110107150247.000|TR0|shift in the way the military does 
20110107150247.000|20110107150249.000|TR0|business.  Have a listen.

20110107150256.000|20110107150258.000|TR0|ROBERT GATES, DEFENSE SECRETARY:  I hope 
20110107150258.000|20110107150301.000|TR0|an expectation is that as a result of 
20110107150301.000|20110107150303.000|TR0|these changes over time, what had been a 
20110107150303.000|20110107150305.000|TR0|culture of endless money where cost was 
20110107150305.000|20110107150308.000|TR0|rarely a consideration will become a 
20110107150308.000|20110107150310.000|TR0|culture of savings and restraint.

20110107150317.000|20110107150319.000|TR0|STARR:  There will be some cuts in the 
20110107150319.000|20110107150321.000|TR0|size of the Army and Marine Corps.  A lot 
20110107150321.000|20110107150324.000|TR0|of these are going to have to be approved 
20110107150324.000|20110107150326.000|TR0|on Capitol Hill where he faces that 
20110107150326.000|20110107150328.000|TR0|typical configuration that we're seeing 
20110107150328.000|20110107150331.000|TR0|emerge, the deficit hawks who may want 
20110107150331.000|20110107150333.000|TR0|even deeper cuts and the pro-military part 
20110107150333.000|20110107150335.000|TR0|of the Congress who's very leery of these 
20110107150335.000|20110107150338.000|TR0|cuts and wants to keep defense spending 
20110107150338.000|20110107150340.000|TR0|up.  The bottom line is that looks like 
20110107150340.000|20110107150342.000|TR0|these will be the biggest cuts in military 
20110107150342.000|20110107150345.000|TR0|spending since 9/11.  Kyra.
20110107150345.000|20110107150347.000|TR0|
20110107150347.000|20110107150349.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   All right.  So, let's talk 
20110107150349.000|20110107150352.000|TR0|more about what could be on the chopping  
20110107150352.000|20110107150354.000|TR0|block here.
20110107150354.000|20110107150356.000|TR0|
20110107150356.000|20110107150359.000|TR0|STARR:  Exactly.  Well, the Marine Corps 
20110107150359.000|20110107150401.000|TR0|is likely immediately to take the biggest 
20110107150401.000|20110107150403.000|TR0|hit.  Gates is planning to cancel and the 
20110107150403.000|20110107150406.000|TR0|Marines approved of that cancellation, a 
20110107150406.000|20110107150408.000|TR0|new amphibious assault vehicle that they 
20110107150408.000|20110107150410.000|TR0|can't afford it and it doesn't exactly 
20110107150410.000|20110107150413.000|TR0|work the way they hoped, not exactly what 
20110107150413.000|20110107150415.000|TR0|they need.  So they'll save about $12 
20110107150415.000|20110107150417.000|TR0|billion there.
20110107150417.000|20110107150420.000|TR0|
20110107150420.000|20110107150422.000|TR0|There's another fighter jet in the works.  
20110107150422.000|20110107150424.000|TR0|It's a troubled program.  Gates gave them 
20110107150424.000|20110107150426.000|TR0|two years to get that in shape or that may 
20110107150426.000|20110107150429.000|TR0|go on the chopping block as well.  But 
20110107150429.000|20110107150431.000|TR0|guess what the real rub here may be health 
20110107150431.000|20110107150433.000|TR0|care.  Military health care for retirees.  
20110107150433.000|20110107150436.000|TR0|They haven't had a premium increase in 
20110107150436.000|20110107150438.000|TR0|over a decade.  For the retirees, they pay 
20110107150438.000|20110107150440.000|TR0|a premium of about $460 a year for a 
20110107150440.000|20110107150443.000|TR0|family of four.  We all pay a lot more 
20110107150443.000|20110107150445.000|TR0|than that.  That health care budget for 
20110107150445.000|20110107150447.000|TR0|the Pentagon topping $50 billion a year.
20110107150447.000|20110107150450.000|TR0|
20110107150450.000|20110107150452.000|TR0|Gates says they have to get that under 
20110107150452.000|20110107150454.000|TR0|control.  That's a top priority.  So they 
20110107150454.000|20110107150457.000|TR0|want to raise the cost for military 
20110107150457.000|20110107150459.000|TR0|retirees.  That is going to run into a 
20110107150459.000|20110107150501.000|TR0|buzz saw on Capitol Hill.  It's generally 
20110107150501.000|20110107150504.000|TR0|agreed, the veterans community, of course, 
20110107150504.000|20110107150506.000|TR0| very strong in Congress. Kyra.
20110107150506.000|20110107150508.000|TR0|
20110107150508.000|20110107150511.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Yes, indeed.  All right.  
20110107150511.000|20110107150513.000|TR0|Barbara, thanks.

20110107150520.000|20110107150522.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, this morning, we've got a 
20110107150522.000|20110107150525.000|TR0|new measure of the economy.  We have 
20110107150525.000|20110107150527.000|TR0|learned that the nation's jobless rate 
20110107150527.000|20110107150529.000|TR0|took a big tumble last month to 9.4 
20110107150529.000|20110107150531.000|TR0|percent.  That's compared to 9.8 percent 
20110107150531.000|20110107150534.000|TR0|in November.  Just over 100,000 new jobs 
20110107150534.000|20110107150536.000|TR0|were added to the economy.  Now that 
20110107150536.000|20110107150538.000|TR0|sounds like good news, right?  Well, not 
20110107150538.000|20110107150541.000|TR0|exactly.

20110107150557.000|20110107150559.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's not bad news.  
20110107150559.000|20110107150602.000|TR0|I'm one of these guys who think at least 
20110107150602.000|20110107150604.000|TR0|we're in the right direction, we're not 
20110107150604.000|20110107150606.000|TR0|going down.
20110107150606.000|20110107150609.000|TR0|
20110107150609.000|20110107150611.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Right.
20110107150611.000|20110107150613.000|TR0|
20110107150613.000|20110107150616.000|TR0|VELSHI:  We wanted 165,000, 175,000, some 
20110107150616.000|20110107150618.000|TR0|people hoped for 200,000 new jobs, we need 
20110107150618.000|20110107150620.000|TR0|more than 250 just to try to get back to 
20110107150620.000|20110107150623.000|TR0|just where we were before this recession.  
20110107150623.000|20110107150625.000|TR0|So it's to slow.  The unemployment rate, 
20110107150625.000|20110107150627.000|TR0|that's quite a drop, 9.8 to 9.4 percent.  
20110107150627.000|20110107150630.000|TR0|But we're measuring a shrinking body of 
20110107150630.000|20110107150632.000|TR0|workers.  So it's almost irrelevant.  I 
20110107150632.000|20110107150634.000|TR0|tend to put that aside even though that's 
20110107150634.000|20110107150636.000|TR0|the one people track a lot. I track how 
20110107150636.000|20110107150639.000|TR0|many jobs are created.  Yes, it's great.  
20110107150639.000|20110107150641.000|TR0|It's above 100,000.  I would have loved if 
20110107150641.000|20110107150643.000|TR0|it were above 200,000.  I would have been 
20110107150643.000|20110107150646.000|TR0|OK if it were  150.
20110107150646.000|20110107150648.000|TR0|
20110107150648.000|20110107150650.000|TR0|This is a little slow.  It is in the right 
20110107150650.000|20110107150653.000|TR0|direction.
20110107150653.000|20110107150655.000|TR0|
20110107150655.000|20110107150657.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  It's interesting looking at 
20110107150657.000|20110107150700.000|TR0|where the jobs are.  You broke it down.  
20110107150700.000|20110107150702.000|TR0|Leisure and hospitality.
20110107150702.000|20110107150704.000|TR0|
20110107150704.000|20110107150707.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Yes.
20110107150707.000|20110107150709.000|TR0|
20110107150709.000|20110107150711.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Which is great because that 
20110107150711.000|20110107150714.000|TR0|means people are spending. They're 
20110107150714.000|20110107150716.000|TR0|traveling, vacationing.
20110107150716.000|20110107150718.000|TR0|
20110107150718.000|20110107150721.000|TR0|VELSHI:  That's right.  It could be 
20110107150721.000|20110107150723.000|TR0|Americans spending because we're saving a 
20110107150723.000|20110107150725.000|TR0|little bit more.  It could be people from 
20110107150725.000|20110107150728.000|TR0|outside the United States spending because 
20110107150728.000|20110107150730.000|TR0|the U.S. dollar is weak.  The good thing 
20110107150730.000|20110107150732.000|TR0|about that is those are industries that 
20110107150732.000|20110107150734.000|TR0|hire people when demand goes up.  So 
20110107150734.000|20110107150737.000|TR0|hopefully, we see this run-on effect where 
20110107150737.000|20110107150739.000|TR0|businesses are making a little bit more 
20110107150739.000|20110107150741.000|TR0|money, demand is going up and people are 
20110107150741.000|20110107150744.000|TR0|getting more jobs.  We also saw health 
20110107150744.000|20110107150746.000|TR0|care as an increase.  That's typical.
20110107150746.000|20110107150748.000|TR0|
20110107150748.000|20110107150751.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And jobs.
20110107150751.000|20110107150753.000|TR0|
20110107150753.000|20110107150755.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Increase in jobs.
20110107150755.000|20110107150758.000|TR0|
20110107150758.000|20110107150800.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Right.
20110107150800.000|20110107150802.000|TR0|
20110107150802.000|20110107150805.000|TR0|VELSHI:  We saw manufacturing increase.  
20110107150805.000|20110107150807.000|TR0|That's very, we've been seeing that in the 
20110107150807.000|20110107150809.000|TR0|last few months, but we lost manufacturing 
20110107150809.000|20110107150812.000|TR0|jobs for so long.  It's nice to see a 
20110107150812.000|20110107150814.000|TR0|little bit there and retail up a little 
20110107150814.000|20110107150816.000|TR0|bit.  A lot of that has to do with the 
20110107150816.000|20110107150819.000|TR0|holidays.  But you know, good, not great.
20110107150819.000|20110107150821.000|TR0|
20110107150821.000|20110107150823.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   OK.  We want better.  Always.  
20110107150823.000|20110107150826.000|TR0|Thanks, Ali.
20110107150826.000|20110107150828.000|TR0|

20110107150837.000|20110107150839.000|TR0|Well, just last hour on Capitol Hill, one 
20110107150839.000|20110107150842.000|TR0|lawmaker took to the floor of the House to 
20110107150842.000|20110107150844.000|TR0|make a statement that unemployment is not 
20110107150844.000|20110107150846.000|TR0|just about numbers.  Congressman Jesse 
20110107150846.000|20110107150849.000|TR0|Jackson Jr., son of civil rights leader, 
20110107150849.000|20110107150851.000|TR0|Jesse Jackson, wants to remind lawmakers 
20110107150851.000|20110107150853.000|TR0|of the hopelessness and desperation that a 
20110107150853.000|20110107150856.000|TR0|lot of Americans are feeling right now.

20110107150903.000|20110107150905.000|TR0|REP. JESSE JACKSON, JR. (D), ILLINOIS:  In 
20110107150905.000|20110107150907.000|TR0|order to show the huge need for jobs, I'll 
20110107150907.000|20110107150910.000|TR0|be collecting resumes from Americans who 
20110107150910.000|20110107150912.000|TR0|are unemployed or underemployed.  I'll 
20110107150912.000|20110107150914.000|TR0|submit them for the congressional record.  
20110107150914.000|20110107150917.000|TR0|Unfortunately, submitting these resumes 
20110107150917.000|20110107150919.000|TR0|for the record will not get anybody a job. 
20110107150919.000|20110107150921.000|TR0| But by collecting these resumes, I hope 
20110107150921.000|20110107150924.000|TR0|to dramatize the shameful condition of 
20110107150924.000|20110107150926.000|TR0|unemployment and compel Congress to do 
20110107150926.000|20110107150928.000|TR0|something about it.

20110107150935.000|20110107150938.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Jackson can see that this move 
20110107150938.000|20110107150940.000|TR0|is more about symbolism than substance, 
20110107150940.000|20110107150942.000|TR0|but he says that it's essential that 
20110107150942.000|20110107150944.000|TR0|Congress and the administration recognize 
20110107150944.000|20110107150947.000|TR0|how many Americans need their help.

20110107150956.000|20110107150958.000|TR0|They'll fill four high profile vacancies.

20110107151012.000|20110107151015.000|TR0|today on Capitol Hill, the first real shot 
20110107151015.000|20110107151017.000|TR0|is fired in the battle to repeal  health 
20110107151017.000|20110107151019.000|TR0|care reform.  The Republican leadership of

20110107151022.000|20110107151024.000|TR0|point issue that helped sweep them into 
20110107151024.000|20110107151026.000|TR0|power.  The House is expected to hold a

20110107151127.000|20110107151129.000|TR0|I said, look at this and look at that.  
20110107151129.000|20110107151131.000|TR0|She looked and she studied and she looked

20110107151159.000|20110107151201.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Get a financial planner.  The 
20110107151201.000|20110107151204.000|TR0|McCullar's will split the $380 million 
20110107151204.000|20110107151206.000|TR0|prize with a winner in Idaho.
20110107151206.000|20110107151208.000|TR0|
20110107151208.000|20110107151211.000|TR0|Rob Marciano, smart man.  He knew exactly 
20110107151211.000|20110107151213.000|TR0|what to do.  He gave the money to the 
20110107151213.000|20110107151215.000|TR0|wife.  Happy wife, happy home.  Or no, 
20110107151215.000|20110107151218.000|TR0|happy wife, happy life.  That (INAUDIBLE) 
20110107151218.000|20110107151220.000|TR0|right.
20110107151220.000|20110107151222.000|TR0|
20110107151222.000|20110107151225.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  I love 
20110107151225.000|20110107151227.000|TR0|them.
20110107151227.000|20110107151229.000|TR0|
20110107151229.000|20110107151232.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, isn't that great?
20110107151232.000|20110107151234.000|TR0|
20110107151234.000|20110107151236.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  That would be great to have 
20110107151236.000|20110107151239.000|TR0|them as my parents, for the millions, I 
20110107151239.000|20110107151241.000|TR0|mean, not because I don't love my parents.
20110107151241.000|20110107151243.000|TR0|
20110107151243.000|20110107151246.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110107151246.000|20110107151248.000|TR0|
20110107151248.000|20110107151250.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And for the attitude too.  
20110107151250.000|20110107151253.000|TR0|They're down home.
20110107151253.000|20110107151255.000|TR0|
20110107151255.000|20110107151257.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  That and tone have quite the 
20110107151257.000|20110107151259.000|TR0|winning attitude as well. Got to get them 
20110107151259.000|20110107151302.000|TR0|on the show some time.
20110107151302.000|20110107151304.000|TR0|
20110107151304.000|20110107151306.000|TR0|Hey, big storm.  Big.  Huge.  But it's not 
20110107151306.000|20110107151309.000|TR0|very concentrated, so it's not a blizzard 
20110107151309.000|20110107151311.000|TR0|that we saw last week.  That's for sure.  
20110107151311.000|20110107151313.000|TR0|I mean it stretches back from the western 
20110107151313.000|20110107151316.000|TR0|Great Lakes down through the south and up 
20110107151316.000|20110107151318.000|TR0|towards the northeast and that's where 
20110107151318.000|20110107151320.000|TR0|most of the action is right now.  We're 
20110107151320.000|20110107151323.000|TR0|seeing some heavier bands  of snow get up 
20110107151323.000|20110107151325.000|TR0|towards Philadelphia or just now through 
20110107151325.000|20110107151327.000|TR0|Philadelphia heading up the turnpike in 
20110107151327.000|20110107151330.000|TR0|through New York City, really heavy band 
20110107151330.000|20110107151332.000|TR0|now heading to New York City.
20110107151332.000|20110107151334.000|TR0|
20110107151334.000|20110107151337.000|TR0|So this is the pulse that will probably 
20110107151337.000|20110107151339.000|TR0|drop a few inches of snow on the Big Apple 
20110107151339.000|20110107151341.000|TR0|and then begin to roll off and pivot up 
20110107151341.000|20110107151344.000|TR0|towards New England.  Where we think we 
20110107151344.000|20110107151346.000|TR0|see the most amount of snow, will probably 
20110107151346.000|20110107151348.000|TR0|be a little bit further up  state, up 
20110107151348.000|20110107151351.000|TR0|towards the Adirondacks.  Five to 10 
20110107151351.000|20110107151353.000|TR0|inches, added lift there.  That's where 
20110107151353.000|20110107151355.000|TR0|the winter storm warnings are posted.  
20110107151355.000|20110107151357.000|TR0|Winter weather advisories in this kind of 
20110107151357.000|20110107151400.000|TR0|purple area.
20110107151400.000|20110107151402.000|TR0|
20110107151402.000|20110107151404.000|TR0|That's where we'll probably see anywhere 
20110107151404.000|20110107151407.000|TR0|from two inches to maybe as much as five 
20110107151407.000|20110107151409.000|TR0|inches of snow as this system makes its 
20110107151409.000|20110107151411.000|TR0|way towards the northeast.  But again, the 
20110107151411.000|20110107151414.000|TR0|backside of this is driving some snow all 
20110107151414.000|20110107151416.000|TR0|the way down through the Tennessee Valley, 
20110107151416.000|20110107151418.000|TR0|so we could see a couple of inches here.  
20110107151418.000|20110107151421.000|TR0|But more importantly, what this will do 
20110107151421.000|20110107151423.000|TR0|over the next couple of days is really 
20110107151423.000|20110107151425.000|TR0|drive down some cold air.
20110107151425.000|20110107151428.000|TR0|
20110107151428.000|20110107151430.000|TR0|Tomorrow, the cold front gets down all the 
20110107151430.000|20110107151432.000|TR0|way into the Gulf Coast and that will drop 
20110107151432.000|20110107151435.000|TR0|sub freezing temperatures in through 
20110107151435.000|20110107151437.000|TR0|Dixie, and then we'll look for a bit of a 
20110107151437.000|20110107151439.000|TR0|disturbance.  We're going to talk about 
20110107151439.000|20110107151442.000|TR0|that in just a second as far as what that 
20110107151442.000|20110107151444.000|TR0|will mean for us going forward.
20110107151444.000|20110107151446.000|TR0|
20110107151446.000|20110107151449.000|TR0|But for the immediate concern for 
20110107151449.000|20110107151451.000|TR0|travelers, we've got some issues today at 
20110107151451.000|20110107151453.000|TR0|the - especially the northeast airports.  
20110107151453.000|20110107151456.000|TR0|Hour and 30- minute delay right now in 
20110107151456.000|20110107151458.000|TR0|LaGuardia.  An hour delay in Philadelphia. 
20110107151458.000|20110107151500.000|TR0|Still ground stop at Teterboro and San 
20110107151500.000|20110107151502.000|TR0|Francisco also getting into the act.
20110107151502.000|20110107151505.000|TR0|
20110107151505.000|20110107151507.000|TR0|All right.  Let's talk about Sunday night 
20110107151507.000|20110107151509.000|TR0|into Monday, there's cold air in place 
20110107151509.000|20110107151512.000|TR0|across Dixie.  If we get any moisture 
20110107151512.000|20110107151514.000|TR0|coming out of the Gulf of Mexico, that 
20110107151514.000|20110107151516.000|TR0|spells trouble.  That's the recipe for an 
20110107151516.000|20110107151519.000|TR0|ice and snowstorm.  And right now, most of 
20110107151519.000|20110107151521.000|TR0|our computer models are forecasting just 
20110107151521.000|20110107151523.000|TR0|that.  and for the lower states south, 
20110107151523.000|20110107151526.000|TR0|that means the cold air stays north.  That 
20110107151526.000|20110107151528.000|TR0|means you've got a snow and icy mix in 
20110107151528.000|20110107151530.000|TR0|through this area and potentially, a 
20110107151530.000|20110107151533.000|TR0|couple of inches of snow from Birmingham, 
20110107151533.000|20110107151535.000|TR0|maybe as far south as Montgomery, up 
20110107151535.000|20110107151537.000|TR0|through Atlanta and then maybe another 
20110107151537.000|20110107151540.000|TR0|quarter of an inch of ice on top of that.
20110107151540.000|20110107151542.000|TR0|
20110107151542.000|20110107151544.000|TR0|So Sunday night into Monday may very well 
20110107151544.000|20110107151547.000|TR0|prove to be a little bit more of a  
20110107151547.000|20110107151549.000|TR0|serious weather situation as compared to 
20110107151549.000|20110107151551.000|TR0|what the snowstorm is doing to the 
20110107151551.000|20110107151554.000|TR0|northeast right now.  Kyra, back over to 
20110107151554.000|20110107151556.000|TR0|you.

20110107151558.000|20110107151601.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   OK.  Thanks, Rob.

20110107151607.000|20110107151610.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, Aretha Franklin is 
20110107151610.000|20110107151612.000|TR0|reportedly talking about her health scare 
20110107151612.000|20110107151614.000|TR0|now.  Next, you're going to see what she 
20110107151614.000|20110107151617.000|TR0|is saying and what she's not in your

20110107151631.000|20110107151633.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, the queen of soul 
20110107151633.000|20110107151635.000|TR0|reportedly says her health issue is 
20110107151635.000|20110107151638.000|TR0|"resolved."  But according to "People" 
20110107151638.000|20110107151640.000|TR0|magazine, Aretha Franklin still refuses to 
20110107151640.000|20110107151642.000|TR0|disclose details about her surgery last 
20110107151642.000|20110107151645.000|TR0|month.  Let's talk about that more and of 
20110107151645.000|20110107151647.000|TR0|course, other entertainment news with our 
20110107151647.000|20110107151649.000|TR0|A.J. Hammer, live in New York.

20110107151652.000|20110107151654.000|TR0|A.J., what are you hearing about Miss 
20110107151654.000|20110107151656.000|TR0|Franklin?  She's had some tough medical  
20110107151656.000|20110107151659.000|TR0|issues in the past few years.
20110107151659.000|20110107151701.000|TR0|
20110107151701.000|20110107151703.000|TR0|A.J. HAMMER, HOST "SHOWBIZ TONIGHT":  Yes, 
20110107151703.000|20110107151706.000|TR0|she has and particularly in the past few 
20110107151706.000|20110107151708.000|TR0|months, but Kyra, at a minimum, it does 
20110107151708.000|20110107151710.000|TR0|sound like good news.  As you said, 
20110107151710.000|20110107151712.000|TR0|Aretha's really trying to reassure her 
20110107151712.000|20110107151715.000|TR0|fans after this health square forced her 
20110107151715.000|20110107151717.000|TR0|to cancel a string of concerts.  She's 
20110107151717.000|20110107151719.000|TR0|telling "Jet" magazine, "the problem has 
20110107151719.000|20110107151722.000|TR0|been resolved."  But she's still not 
20110107151722.000|20110107151724.000|TR0|explaining just what is or what was wrong 
20110107151724.000|20110107151726.000|TR0|with her.  Now "Jet" says when they asked 
20110107151726.000|20110107151729.000|TR0|her directly about the rumors she's 
20110107151729.000|20110107151731.000|TR0|fighting pancreatic cancer, she refused to 
20110107151731.000|20110107151733.000|TR0|address that story directly and she said 
20110107151733.000|20110107151736.000|TR0|"I don't have to talk about my health with 
20110107151736.000|20110107151738.000|TR0|anybody other than my doctors."  As I've 
20110107151738.000|20110107151740.000|TR0|said all along, Kyra, you have got to 
20110107151740.000|20110107151743.000|TR0|respect that.  Nonetheless, obviously, 
20110107151743.000|20110107151745.000|TR0|Aretha Franklin has a whole lot of fans 
20110107151745.000|20110107151747.000|TR0|that remain very concerned about her.

20110107151750.000|20110107151752.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   A lot of people.  Well, 
20110107151752.000|20110107151754.000|TR0|somebody that is definitely talking, Oprah 
20110107151754.000|20110107151757.000|TR0|Winfrey, and talking about her 
20110107151757.000|20110107151759.000|TR0|newly-launched cable network.  Boy, she's 
20110107151759.000|20110107151801.000|TR0|saying, "I don't care about ratings, I 
20110107151801.000|20110107151804.000|TR0|don't care about what people say, this is 
20110107151804.000|20110107151806.000|TR0|what I'm in support of.  This is what's 
20110107151806.000|20110107151808.000|TR0|going to stay and I'm loving it."
20110107151808.000|20110107151811.000|TR0|
20110107151811.000|20110107151813.000|TR0|HAMMER:  Yes.  It's a great new chapter 
20110107151813.000|20110107151815.000|TR0|for her, I think.  She was talking to the 
20110107151815.000|20110107151817.000|TR0|press in the Television's Critics 
20110107151817.000|20110107151820.000|TR0|Association in Los Angeles.  Obviously, 
20110107151820.000|20110107151822.000|TR0|Oprah's very excited about her new network 
20110107151822.000|20110107151824.000|TR0|and "Showbiz Tonight" did catch up  with 
20110107151824.000|20110107151827.000|TR0|her as she was on her way into a reception 
20110107151827.000|20110107151829.000|TR0|for the network.  It's called OWN.  I want 
20110107151829.000|20110107151831.000|TR0|you to watch what she told us about how 
20110107151831.000|20110107151834.000|TR0|well the start-up seems to be going.

20110107151843.000|20110107151845.000|TR0|coming early to the network.  I'm hearing 
20110107151845.000|20110107151848.000|TR0|you guys are making a profit before you 
20110107151848.000|20110107151850.000|TR0|thought you would.

20110107151852.000|20110107151855.000|TR0|OPRAH WINFREY, TV HOST:  I heard that, 
20110107151855.000|20110107151857.000|TR0|too, but let's no do the hula over that.  
20110107151857.000|20110107151859.000|TR0|Let's just calm down and this is day six.  
20110107151859.000|20110107151902.000|TR0|Let's get to day 14, and then let's get to

20110107151911.000|20110107151913.000|TR0|HAMMER:  OK, so she's being cautiously 
20110107151913.000|20110107151916.000|TR0|optimistic, I guess.  Now, the network 
20110107151916.000|20110107151918.000|TR0|launched on January 1st, Oprah told us she 
20110107151918.000|20110107151920.000|TR0|wasn't able to watch the network for most 
20110107151920.000|20110107151922.000|TR0|of its first day  because the hotel she 
20110107151922.000|20110107151925.000|TR0|was in on New Year's Day didn't have her 
20110107151925.000|20110107151927.000|TR0|network so she was following what was 
20110107151927.000|20110107151929.000|TR0|going on by looking at the online  message 
20110107151929.000|20110107151932.000|TR0|boards.
20110107151932.000|20110107151934.000|TR0|
20110107151934.000|20110107151936.000|TR0|And she also, Kyra, gave us a little 
20110107151936.000|20110107151939.000|TR0|behind the scenes info on what she called 
20110107151939.000|20110107151941.000|TR0|one of the toughest interviews she has had 
20110107151941.000|20110107151943.000|TR0|in 20 years.  That interview conducted by 
20110107151943.000|20110107151946.000|TR0|our new colleague Piers Morgan. And Oprah 
20110107151946.000|20110107151948.000|TR0|says she's a big fan of his.  She told us 
20110107151948.000|20110107151950.000|TR0|she was scheduled to sit down with Piers 
20110107151950.000|20110107151953.000|TR0|for about 45 minutes but the interview had 
20110107151953.000|20110107151955.000|TR0|gone so well it lasted for two and a half 
20110107151955.000|20110107151957.000|TR0|hours.  She is the first guest for Pierce 
20110107151957.000|20110107152000.000|TR0|on his new show.  It sounds like something 
20110107152000.000|20110107152002.000|TR0|that we're all going to watch.  Of course, 
20110107152002.000|20110107152004.000|TR0|"Piers Morgan Tonight" debuts on January 
20110107152004.000|20110107152007.000|TR0|17th, 9:00 p.m. here on CNN and when 
20110107152007.000|20110107152009.000|TR0|"Showbiz Tonight" was speaking with her, 
20110107152009.000|20110107152011.000|TR0|Kyra, we asked her if we will be surprised 
20110107152011.000|20110107152014.000|TR0|by what happened in this interview and her 
20110107152014.000|20110107152016.000|TR0|response was, "I was surprised."
20110107152016.000|20110107152018.000|TR0|
20110107152018.000|20110107152020.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Oh, my gosh.  We thought the 
20110107152020.000|20110107152023.000|TR0|Barbara Walters interview was pretty 
20110107152023.000|20110107152025.000|TR0|intense and brought her to tears.  It's 
20110107152025.000|20110107152027.000|TR0|going to be interesting to see what Piers 
20110107152027.000|20110107152030.000|TR0|Morgan is able to bring home for us.
20110107152030.000|20110107152032.000|TR0|
20110107152032.000|20110107152034.000|TR0|HAMMER:  Yes, there's a deep tease there, 
20110107152034.000|20110107152037.000|TR0|but a good vote of confidence from  Oprah 
20110107152037.000|20110107152039.000|TR0|Winfrey.  She's a huge fan and Gayle King 
20110107152039.000|20110107152041.000|TR0|who put the whole thing together also a 
20110107152041.000|20110107152044.000|TR0|huge fan of Piers.  So I'm looking forward 
20110107152044.000|20110107152046.000|TR0|to this.
20110107152046.000|20110107152048.000|TR0|

20110107152105.000|20110107152107.000|TR0|Remember all that talk about death panels 
20110107152107.000|20110107152109.000|TR0|during the health care debate?  Well, one 
20110107152109.000|20110107152112.000|TR0|lawmaker says they're a reality in his 
20110107152112.000|20110107152114.000|TR0|state.  He's talking about budget cuts 
20110107152114.000|20110107152116.000|TR0|that have denied nearly 100 people 
20110107152116.000|20110107152119.000|TR0|potentially life saving transplants.  Two 
20110107152119.000|20110107152121.000|TR0|people have already been denied and died.

20110107152123.000|20110107152125.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)     PHILLIPS:  Well, 
20110107152125.000|20110107152128.000|TR0|some residents in Venice, Florida, are 
20110107152128.000|20110107152130.000|TR0|seeing orange.  That massive orange is a 
20110107152130.000|20110107152132.000|TR0|crocodile and the rare creature tops our 
20110107152132.000|20110107152135.000|TR0|trek cross country this hour.  Sylvia 
20110107152135.000|20110107152137.000|TR0|Mythen captured pictures of the croc near 
20110107152137.000|20110107152139.000|TR0|her neighborhood pond.  One biologist says 
20110107152139.000|20110107152142.000|TR0|it possibly is an albino, but one official 
20110107152142.000|20110107152144.000|TR0|at the State Fish and Wildfire Department 
20110107152144.000|20110107152146.000|TR0|believes that the orange coloring is from 
20110107152146.000|20110107152149.000|TR0|paint or stain.

20110107152212.000|20110107152214.000|TR0|had one go through the backside of my

20110107152237.000|20110107152240.000|TR0|in overdrive and takes it on the highway.  
20110107152240.000|20110107152242.000|TR0|Drivers spotted the man rolling down the

20110107152244.000|20110107152247.000|TR0|cameras actually captured him when he 
20110107152247.000|20110107152249.000|TR0|exited the freeway.  He didn't get a 
20110107152249.000|20110107152251.000|TR0|ticket, but police say his ride was 
20110107152251.000|20110107152254.000|TR0|illegal.

20110107152256.000|20110107152258.000|TR0|Well, nearly 100 people in Arizona need 
20110107152258.000|20110107152301.000|TR0|potentially life-saving transplants, but 
20110107152301.000|20110107152303.000|TR0|they can't get them.  Not in their state 
20110107152303.000|20110107152305.000|TR0|any way. Why?  Tough times.  Politics.  
20110107152305.000|20110107152308.000|TR0|And some people say misplaced priorities.  
20110107152308.000|20110107152310.000|TR0|Arizona cut its share of Medicaid funding 
20110107152310.000|20110107152312.000|TR0|$1.2 million is what we're talking about.  
20110107152312.000|20110107152315.000|TR0|That was for certain transplants and it 
20110107152315.000|20110107152317.000|TR0|lost matching federal money in the process.
20110107152317.000|20110107152319.000|TR0|
20110107152319.000|20110107152322.000|TR0|Now, it leaves two people denied

20110107152347.000|20110107152349.000|TR0|this and it's going to take too much time. 
20110107152349.000|20110107152352.000|TR0| People have already died.

20110107152354.000|20110107152356.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Is the state doing 
20110107152356.000|20110107152359.000|TR0|anything now to restore the funding?
20110107152359.000|20110107152401.000|TR0|
20110107152401.000|20110107152403.000|TR0|FRANK ANTENORI, ARIZONA STATE SENATE:  No, 
20110107152403.000|20110107152406.000|TR0|again, the funding reduction occurred 
20110107152406.000|20110107152408.000|TR0|because data showed that the outcome from 
20110107152408.000|20110107152410.000|TR0|providing funding for these patients was 
20110107152410.000|20110107152413.000|TR0|negligible.

20110107152420.000|20110107152422.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  I want to 
20110107152422.000|20110107152424.000|TR0|apologize.  The sound that you just heard 
20110107152424.000|20110107152427.000|TR0|from  the gentleman you saw with the 
20110107152427.000|20110107152429.000|TR0|oxygen, that is actually somebody that was 
20110107152429.000|20110107152431.000|TR0|denied a transplant and died.
20110107152431.000|20110107152434.000|TR0|
20110107152434.000|20110107152436.000|TR0|This morning on AMERICAN MORNING, we 
20110107152436.000|20110107152438.000|TR0|talked to another patient who is waiting 
20110107152438.000|20110107152440.000|TR0|for a transplant and is worried that 
20110107152440.000|20110107152443.000|TR0|that's what's going to happen to her if 
20110107152443.000|20110107152445.000|TR0|indeed this money is not restored for her 
20110107152445.000|20110107152447.000|TR0|to get her transplant.
20110107152447.000|20110107152450.000|TR0|
20110107152450.000|20110107152452.000|TR0|So while people wait, the politicians, of 
20110107152452.000|20110107152454.000|TR0|course, they're pointing fingers and one 
20110107152454.000|20110107152457.000|TR0|state lawmaker, the Democratic minority 
20110107152457.000|20110107152459.000|TR0|leader, says she's trying to restore that 
20110107152459.000|20110107152501.000|TR0|funding and is urging the governor to use 
20110107152501.000|20110107152504.000|TR0|federal stimulus money to help.  The 
20110107152504.000|20110107152506.000|TR0|spokesman for Republican governor Jan 
20110107152506.000|20110107152508.000|TR0|Brewer says that democrats were asked more 
20110107152508.000|20110107152511.000|TR0|than a year ago for a plan that could 
20110107152511.000|20110107152513.000|TR0|work, but so far, all they've been offered 
20110107152513.000|20110107152515.000|TR0|is empty words.
20110107152515.000|20110107152518.000|TR0|
20110107152518.000|20110107152520.000|TR0|All right.  We are talking with the 
20110107152520.000|20110107152522.000|TR0|Democratic minority leader in Arizona now 
20110107152522.000|20110107152525.000|TR0|who says what's happening in his state 
20110107152525.000|20110107152527.000|TR0|amounts to a death panel.  Remember that 
20110107152527.000|20110107152529.000|TR0|term?  Well, David Schapira joins us now, 
20110107152529.000|20110107152532.000|TR0|live from Phoenix and our senior medical 
20110107152532.000|20110107152534.000|TR0|correspondent Elizabeth Cohen is here, 
20110107152534.000|20110107152536.000|TR0|too.  She'll give us sort of a brighter 
20110107152536.000|20110107152539.000|TR0|picture on Transplants in other states.
20110107152539.000|20110107152541.000|TR0|
20110107152541.000|20110107152543.000|TR0|But David, let's first go to you.  And 
20110107152543.000|20110107152545.000|TR0|your response to the governor's words 
20110107152545.000|20110107152548.000|TR0|about empty rhetoric because I was reading 
20110107152548.000|20110107152550.000|TR0|what Governor Brewer was saying "look, you 
20110107152550.000|20110107152552.000|TR0|need to be someone that's involved in 
20110107152552.000|20110107152555.000|TR0|trying to find a workable plan to resolve 
20110107152555.000|20110107152557.000|TR0|Arizona's budget crisis first.
20110107152557.000|20110107152559.000|TR0|
20110107152559.000|20110107152602.000|TR0|DAVID SCHAPIRA, ARIZONA STATE SENATE:  
20110107152602.000|20110107152604.000|TR0|Well, good morning, Kyra. And let me just 
20110107152604.000|20110107152606.000|TR0|say, the governor's  spokesperson has come 
20110107152606.000|20110107152609.000|TR0|out and said that I've been asked for a 
20110107152609.000|20110107152611.000|TR0|year to provide a plan and I haven't done 
20110107152611.000|20110107152613.000|TR0|that, and so I can't be out there publicly 
20110107152613.000|20110107152616.000|TR0|calling for her to restore this funding.  
20110107152616.000|20110107152618.000|TR0|But the fact of the matter is I haven't 
20110107152618.000|20110107152620.000|TR0|been sworn in as minority leader yet.  
20110107152620.000|20110107152623.000|TR0|That won't be until this coming Monday.
20110107152623.000|20110107152625.000|TR0|
20110107152625.000|20110107152627.000|TR0|So I've never been asked for a plan.  The 
20110107152627.000|20110107152630.000|TR0|previous leadership may have been asked.  
20110107152630.000|20110107152632.000|TR0|I've never had a conversation with the 
20110107152632.000|20110107152634.000|TR0|governor or the governor's spokesperson 
20110107152634.000|20110107152637.000|TR0|about that.  But here's the thing, we've 
20110107152637.000|20110107152639.000|TR0|got to put all these politics aside.  And 
20110107152639.000|20110107152641.000|TR0|just forget it.  Who cares who did what, 
20110107152641.000|20110107152643.000|TR0|when.
20110107152643.000|20110107152646.000|TR0|
20110107152646.000|20110107152648.000|TR0|People are dying.  There are 96 people, as 
20110107152648.000|20110107152650.000|TR0|far as we know, who are still alive and 
20110107152650.000|20110107152653.000|TR0|that's the issue at hand.  We've got to 
20110107152653.000|20110107152655.000|TR0|restore this funding, $1.2 million.  It's 
20110107152655.000|20110107152657.000|TR0|a miniscule part of the state's budget.  
20110107152657.000|20110107152700.000|TR0|I've offered the governor 10 if not 20 
20110107152700.000|20110107152702.000|TR0|options of things that we could cut.  
20110107152702.000|20110107152704.000|TR0|Folks who were medical professionals in 
20110107152704.000|20110107152707.000|TR0|Arizona have offered up things that we 
20110107152707.000|20110107152709.000|TR0|could cut within our state.  Medicaid 
20110107152709.000|20110107152711.000|TR0|program have just moved that money to the 
20110107152711.000|20110107152714.000|TR0|transplant funding. People's lives are 
20110107152714.000|20110107152716.000|TR0|literally at stake at this point and we've 
20110107152716.000|20110107152718.000|TR0|really got to just put all these politics 
20110107152718.000|20110107152721.000|TR0|aside.
20110107152721.000|20110107152723.000|TR0|
20110107152723.000|20110107152725.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  That's got to be heart 
20110107152725.000|20110107152728.000|TR0|wrenching to see that two people have 
20110107152728.000|20110107152730.000|TR0|already died because they've been delisted 
20110107152730.000|20110107152732.000|TR0|and now, you're saying 96 people are 
20110107152732.000|20110107152735.000|TR0|hoping that they won't be next?
20110107152735.000|20110107152737.000|TR0|
20110107152737.000|20110107152739.000|TR0|SCHAPIRA:  Yes, absolutely.  There are 96 
20110107152739.000|20110107152742.000|TR0|people still on that transplant list who 
20110107152742.000|20110107152744.000|TR0|have been told that they would receive 
20110107152744.000|20110107152746.000|TR0|transplants paid for by our state's 
20110107152746.000|20110107152748.000|TR0|Medicaid program, and many of which were 
20110107152748.000|20110107152751.000|TR0|added to the transplant list, had 
20110107152751.000|20110107152753.000|TR0|surgeries scheduled and then were sent 
20110107152753.000|20110107152755.000|TR0|denial letters after October 1st.  Those 
20110107152755.000|20110107152758.000|TR0|96 people right now are waiting for the 
20110107152758.000|20110107152800.000|TR0|state legislature to come back into 
20110107152800.000|20110107152802.000|TR0|session.
20110107152802.000|20110107152805.000|TR0|
20110107152805.000|20110107152807.000|TR0|Because clearly the governor is not going 
20110107152807.000|20110107152809.000|TR0|to act on this prior to Monday.  Although 
20110107152809.000|20110107152812.000|TR0|we've been calling on her to do so for the 
20110107152812.000|20110107152814.000|TR0|last three months now.  So now, on Monday 
20110107152814.000|20110107152816.000|TR0|I've introduced the very first bill 
20110107152816.000|20110107152819.000|TR0|legislative session, Senate Bill 1001, 
20110107152819.000|20110107152821.000|TR0|which will restore the transplant funding. 
20110107152821.000|20110107152823.000|TR0| And what I'm calling on the Republican 
20110107152823.000|20110107152826.000|TR0|legislature now to do is to suspend the 
20110107152826.000|20110107152828.000|TR0|rules on Monday and have this bill go 
20110107152828.000|20110107152830.000|TR0|through the process on that day, send it 
20110107152830.000|20110107152833.000|TR0|to the governor's desk  Monday and 
20110107152833.000|20110107152835.000|TR0|hopefully get this  signed into law 
20110107152835.000|20110107152837.000|TR0|immediately so we don't lose any other 
20110107152837.000|20110107152840.000|TR0|lives because of the political stall 
20110107152840.000|20110107152842.000|TR0|tactics coming from the governor's office.
20110107152842.000|20110107152844.000|TR0|
20110107152844.000|20110107152847.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Now, this is the emergency 
20110107152847.000|20110107152849.000|TR0|restoration that you are calling for, is 
20110107152849.000|20110107152851.000|TR0|that right?
20110107152851.000|20110107152853.000|TR0|
20110107152853.000|20110107152856.000|TR0|SCHAPIRA:  That's right.  We'd like to 
20110107152856.000|20110107152858.000|TR0|restore this funding immediately because 
20110107152858.000|20110107152900.000|TR0|if there's ever been a more urgent issue, 
20110107152900.000|20110107152903.000|TR0|I haven't heard of it.  I can't think of 
20110107152903.000|20110107152905.000|TR0|anything more  important for us to do on 
20110107152905.000|20110107152907.000|TR0|our first day.  After all the pomp and 
20110107152907.000|20110107152910.000|TR0|circumstance and all of us are sworn in, 
20110107152910.000|20110107152912.000|TR0|let's do some business, let's do some 
20110107152912.000|20110107152914.000|TR0|work, let's do what we were elected to do 
20110107152914.000|20110107152917.000|TR0|by the people of our state and let's 
20110107152917.000|20110107152919.000|TR0|restore this funding.
20110107152919.000|20110107152921.000|TR0|
20110107152921.000|20110107152924.000|TR0|You know, it's very sad, Kyra, in Arizona, 
20110107152924.000|20110107152926.000|TR0|there is a lot of rhetoric that we heard 
20110107152926.000|20110107152928.000|TR0|around the country about Obama care and 
20110107152928.000|20110107152931.000|TR0|about death panels and in  Arizona, we 
20110107152931.000|20110107152933.000|TR0|have what we're calling Brewer care. We 
20110107152933.000|20110107152935.000|TR0|have a governor who basically has refused 
20110107152935.000|20110107152938.000|TR0|to pay for transplants that we have 
20110107152938.000|20110107152940.000|TR0|committed to people of our state that they 
20110107152940.000|20110107152942.000|TR0|would have and now we essentially have a 
20110107152942.000|20110107152945.000|TR0|death panel with the legislature.  If we 
20110107152945.000|20110107152947.000|TR0|are unwilling to pass this on Monday, if 
20110107152947.000|20110107152949.000|TR0|we're unwilling to pass this Monday, if 
20110107152949.000|20110107152952.000|TR0|we're unwilling to get it through, we are 
20110107152952.000|20110107152954.000|TR0|going to have a real death panels right 
20110107152954.000|20110107152956.000|TR0|here in Arizona.
20110107152956.000|20110107152958.000|TR0|
20110107152958.000|20110107153001.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  Minority 
20110107153001.000|20110107153003.000|TR0|leader-elect down in Arizona, David 
20110107153003.000|20110107153005.000|TR0|Schapiro.  Appreciate your time today and 
20110107153005.000|20110107153008.000|TR0|we will be following what happens on 
20110107153008.000|20110107153010.000|TR0|Monday, that's for sure.  Thanks so much.
20110107153010.000|20110107153012.000|TR0|
20110107153012.000|20110107153015.000|TR0|And I also want to talk with our senior 
20110107153015.000|20110107153017.000|TR0|medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen who 
20110107153017.000|20110107153019.000|TR0|has been following this for us as well.  
20110107153019.000|20110107153022.000|TR0|So other states, are they  withdrawing 
20110107153022.000|20110107153024.000|TR0|transplant coverage like this as well?
20110107153024.000|20110107153026.000|TR0|
20110107153026.000|20110107153029.000|TR0|You know, what they're not.  We checked 
20110107153029.000|20110107153031.000|TR0|around with experts and they say that 
20110107153031.000|20110107153033.000|TR0|Governor Brewer is kind of on her own in 
20110107153033.000|20110107153036.000|TR0|this area. They are not taking away money 
20110107153036.000|20110107153038.000|TR0|for transplants.  Now they are trying to 
20110107153038.000|20110107153040.000|TR0|take away money for other kinds of 
20110107153040.000|20110107153043.000|TR0|Medicaid services like hearing or vision 
20110107153043.000|20110107153045.000|TR0|or in some cases, home health care,  but 
20110107153045.000|20110107153047.000|TR0|not transplants.
20110107153047.000|20110107153050.000|TR0|
20110107153050.000|20110107153052.000|TR0|And I think it's important to remember 
20110107153052.000|20110107153054.000|TR0|transplants are, if you're waiting for a 
20110107153054.000|20110107153057.000|TR0|transplant, that's pretty much it.  That's 
20110107153057.000|20110107153059.000|TR0|all that's going to help you.  I mean, 
20110107153059.000|20110107153101.000|TR0|it's either that or you're going to  die 
20110107153101.000|20110107153103.000|TR0|in most cases.  I mean, transplant is the 
20110107153103.000|20110107153106.000|TR0|last thing that you try.     PHILLIPS:   
20110107153106.000|20110107153108.000|TR0|Here's what's interesting.  Other states 
20110107153108.000|20110107153110.000|TR0|have massive Medicaid deficits as well and 
20110107153110.000|20110107153113.000|TR0|they didn't, you know, arrive at the 
20110107153113.000|20110107153115.000|TR0|solution that Arizona says it has.
20110107153115.000|20110107153117.000|TR0|
20110107153117.000|20110107153120.000|TR0|COHEN:  Right.  They figured cuts that are 
20110107153120.000|20110107153122.000|TR0|certainly painful, but not cuts that will 
20110107153122.000|20110107153124.000|TR0|kill people.  It's things like hearing, 
20110107153124.000|20110107153127.000|TR0|vision, home health care.  Again, tough, 
20110107153127.000|20110107153129.000|TR0|tough decisions to make, but not things 
20110107153129.000|20110107153131.000|TR0|that are going to kill people in the 
20110107153131.000|20110107153134.000|TR0|immediate sense like taking a transplant 
20110107153134.000|20110107153136.000|TR0|away, and already two people have died.
20110107153136.000|20110107153138.000|TR0|
20110107153138.000|20110107153141.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Which is heart wrenching to 
20110107153141.000|20110107153143.000|TR0|us.  We're having a hard time  
20110107153143.000|20110107153145.000|TR0|understanding how Arizona's governor Jan 
20110107153145.000|20110107153148.000|TR0|Brewer actually arrived at this  decision 
20110107153148.000|20110107153150.000|TR0|to make these kinds of cuts.  Do we know?
20110107153150.000|20110107153152.000|TR0|
20110107153152.000|20110107153155.000|TR0|COHEN:  She says that her analysis shows 
20110107153155.000|20110107153157.000|TR0|that transplants don't work.  That certain 
20110107153157.000|20110107153159.000|TR0|transplants just don't work.  They don't 
20110107153159.000|20110107153202.000|TR0|prolong life.  Well, legions of doctors 
20110107153202.000|20110107153204.000|TR0|would disagree with her and they have sent 
20110107153204.000|20110107153206.000|TR0|her studies that say "What do you mean.  
20110107153206.000|20110107153208.000|TR0|We've done actually studies and they do 
20110107153208.000|20110107153211.000|TR0|prolong life.  People who are on the verge 
20110107153211.000|20110107153213.000|TR0|of death lived for many years because of 
20110107153213.000|20110107153215.000|TR0|transplants.  So they can't figure out how 
20110107153215.000|20110107153218.000|TR0|she is coming at her conclusions and they, 
20110107153218.000|20110107153220.000|TR0|as medical doctors, are coming up with 
20110107153220.000|20110107153222.000|TR0|totally different conclusions.
20110107153222.000|20110107153225.000|TR0|
20110107153225.000|20110107153227.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And how do you tell these 96 
20110107153227.000|20110107153229.000|TR0|people that are still alive -
20110107153229.000|20110107153232.000|TR0|

20110107153234.000|20110107153236.000|TR0|
20110107153236.000|20110107153239.000|TR0|COHEN:  Sorry?
20110107153239.000|20110107153241.000|TR0|
20110107153241.000|20110107153243.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Sorry, it's not going to happen.
20110107153243.000|20110107153246.000|TR0|
20110107153246.000|20110107153248.000|TR0|COHEN:  Can't even imagine what that feels 
20110107153248.000|20110107153250.000|TR0|like.
20110107153250.000|20110107153253.000|TR0|
20110107153253.000|20110107153255.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:    Well, we're definitely going 
20110107153255.000|20110107153257.000|TR0|to follow up the story. It's pretty gut 
20110107153257.000|20110107153300.000|TR0|wrenching.
20110107153300.000|20110107153302.000|TR0|
20110107153302.000|20110107153304.000|TR0|Elizabeth, thanks.

20110107153503.000|20110107153505.000|TR0|makes me so happy.  You know what we've 
20110107153505.000|20110107153507.000|TR0|been through the last couple of years and 
20110107153507.000|20110107153510.000|TR0|the economy.  It's been awful.  So, to

20110107153521.000|20110107153523.000|TR0|of about 2.8 percent.  That's up from 2.4

20110107153528.000|20110107153530.000|TR0|the planned increases will be about that

20110107153533.000|20110107153535.000|TR0|positions.  And for executive and skilled

20110107153542.000|20110107153544.000|TR0|here -- take a look at where we were from 
20110107153544.000|20110107153547.000|TR0|2005 through 2007.  As you can see, we are 
20110107153547.000|20110107153549.000|TR0|not going to -- we are not at those levels 
20110107153549.000|20110107153551.000|TR0|right now.  We're definitely not there 
20110107153551.000|20110107153554.000|TR0|yet.  But we're moving in the right 
20110107153554.000|20110107153556.000|TR0|direction.
20110107153556.000|20110107153558.000|TR0|
20110107153558.000|20110107153601.000|TR0|And think about it.  We saw the lowest 
20110107153601.000|20110107153603.000|TR0|salary increases in decades because things 
20110107153603.000|20110107153605.000|TR0|have just been so dire.  So, this is good 
20110107153605.000|20110107153608.000|TR0|news. Also, the number of places boosting 
20110107153608.000|20110107153610.000|TR0|staff has actually doubled those cutting 
20110107153610.000|20110107153612.000|TR0|it.  Another sign that things are getting 
20110107153612.000|20110107153615.000|TR0|better, Kyra.
20110107153615.000|20110107153617.000|TR0|
20110107153617.000|20110107153619.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  So, will the rise 
20110107153619.000|20110107153621.000|TR0|in salary put us back in line with where 
20110107153621.000|20110107153624.000|TR0|we were before the recession?
20110107153624.000|20110107153626.000|TR0|
20110107153626.000|20110107153628.000|TR0|ELAM:  Yes.  That's the thing everyone 
20110107153628.000|20110107153631.000|TR0|keeps talking about here with this story. 
20110107153631.000|20110107153633.000|TR0|And in particular, if you look at it, it 
20110107153633.000|20110107153635.000|TR0|says it's going to take some time, and 
20110107153635.000|20110107153638.000|TR0|years to get back.  We won't go back as 
20110107153638.000|20110107153640.000|TR0|quickly as it took us to fall from those 
20110107153640.000|20110107153642.000|TR0|levels.  But they're saying this is a move 
20110107153642.000|20110107153645.000|TR0|in the right direction.
20110107153645.000|20110107153647.000|TR0|
20110107153647.000|20110107153649.000|TR0|The other thing too is that the 
20110107153649.000|20110107153652.000|TR0|differentiation between top performers and 
20110107153652.000|20110107153654.000|TR0|average performers is smaller because most 
20110107153654.000|20110107153656.000|TR0|companies, even though they want to reward 
20110107153656.000|20110107153659.000|TR0|their top workers, the pot of money is 
20110107153659.000|20110107153701.000|TR0|just smaller at this point.
20110107153701.000|20110107153703.000|TR0|
20110107153703.000|20110107153706.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Let's change the direction of 
20110107153706.000|20110107153708.000|TR0|this.  Dressing to impressing getting a 
20110107153708.000|20110107153710.000|TR0|whole new meaning.  People actually 
20110107153710.000|20110107153713.000|TR0|wearing phony glasses.  They think it 
20110107153713.000|20110107153715.000|TR0|makes them look smarter and better chance 
20110107153715.000|20110107153717.000|TR0|of getting a job.
20110107153717.000|20110107153720.000|TR0|
20110107153720.000|20110107153722.000|TR0|ELAM:  I think I'd be embarrassed if 
20110107153722.000|20110107153724.000|TR0|somebody caught me with some fake glasses. 
20110107153724.000|20110107153726.000|TR0|But apparently, that's what they're doing 
20110107153726.000|20110107153729.000|TR0|in Britain. Some people are, anyway.
20110107153729.000|20110107153731.000|TR0|
20110107153731.000|20110107153733.000|TR0|Listen to this.  Forty-three percent of 
20110107153733.000|20110107153736.000|TR0|people there think glasses make people 
20110107153736.000|20110107153738.000|TR0|look smarter.  Thirty-six percent of 
20110107153738.000|20110107153740.000|TR0|people say they look more professional.  
20110107153740.000|20110107153743.000|TR0|And forty percent would consider wearing 
20110107153743.000|20110107153745.000|TR0|fake glasses to get ahead at work if they 
20110107153745.000|20110107153747.000|TR0|thought that was going to help them out.
20110107153747.000|20110107153750.000|TR0|
20110107153750.000|20110107153752.000|TR0|But 60 percent they already do or would 
20110107153752.000|20110107153754.000|TR0|consider glasses to look smarter.  Ten 
20110107153754.000|20110107153757.000|TR0|percent saying the same thingfor being 
20110107153757.000|20110107153759.000|TR0|professional. But these are the people 
20110107153759.000|20110107153801.000|TR0|that may be the most interesting, Kyra.  
20110107153801.000|20110107153804.000|TR0|Six percent wear glasses they don't need 
20110107153804.000|20110107153806.000|TR0|for fashion reasons.  And 9 percent say 
20110107153806.000|20110107153808.000|TR0|they do it just because they look more 
20110107153808.000|20110107153811.000|TR0|attractive.  So, they don the glasses, 
20110107153811.000|20110107153813.000|TR0|don't need them at all.  Phony lenses in 
20110107153813.000|20110107153815.000|TR0|there because they think it gets a message 
20110107153815.000|20110107153818.000|TR0|across.  People take them more seriously.  
20110107153818.000|20110107153820.000|TR0|You know anyone like that?
20110107153820.000|20110107153822.000|TR0|
20110107153822.000|20110107153825.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Actually, I do know a few 
20110107153825.000|20110107153827.000|TR0|people that do that.
20110107153827.000|20110107153829.000|TR0|
20110107153829.000|20110107153831.000|TR0|ELAM:  I thought you did.  I think we both 
20110107153831.000|20110107153834.000|TR0|do.  Use them as a prop to make their 
20110107153834.000|20110107153836.000|TR0|point.
20110107153836.000|20110107153838.000|TR0|
20110107153838.000|20110107153841.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, exactly!  It looks so 
20110107153841.000|20110107153843.000|TR0|official.  Yes.  Makes my -- I have, like, 
20110107153843.000|20110107153845.000|TR0|Coke-bottle lenses.  I hate wearing my 
20110107153845.000|20110107153848.000|TR0|glasses.  But anyway.
20110107153848.000|20110107153850.000|TR0|
20110107153850.000|20110107153852.000|TR0|ELAM:  I don't wear anything at all.  Just 
20110107153852.000|20110107153855.000|TR0|thinking about it makes me want to do that.
20110107153855.000|20110107153857.000|TR0|
20110107153857.000|20110107153859.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, we've got to see those 
20110107153859.000|20110107153902.000|TR0|Stephanie beautiful eyes!
20110107153902.000|20110107153904.000|TR0|
20110107153904.000|20110107153906.000|TR0|ELAM:  Yes, well, whatever.  It's coming!  
20110107153906.000|20110107153909.000|TR0|It's just not here yet.
20110107153909.000|20110107153911.000|TR0|
20110107153911.000|20110107153913.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Thanks, Steph.
20110107153913.000|20110107153916.000|TR0|
20110107153916.000|20110107153918.000|TR0|ELAM:  Have a great weekend.
20110107153918.000|20110107153920.000|TR0|
20110107153920.000|20110107153923.000|TR0|All right.  Even as the jobless rate goes 
20110107153923.000|20110107153925.000|TR0|down - you, too -- the employment market 
20110107153925.000|20110107153927.000|TR0|is still shaky, and we remain committed to 
20110107153927.000|20110107153930.000|TR0|helping those looking for a job with our 
20110107153930.000|20110107153932.000|TR0|"30-Second Pitch."  Today, Tania Anderson, 
20110107153932.000|20110107153934.000|TR0|a former corporate flight attendant and 
20110107153934.000|20110107153936.000|TR0|administrative assistant, is our special 
20110107153936.000|20110107153939.000|TR0|guest.  Tonya has been without a full time 
20110107153939.000|20110107153941.000|TR0|job since 2005.  She's even extended her 
20110107153941.000|20110107153943.000|TR0|training, earning a certificate from UCLA 
20110107153943.000|20110107153946.000|TR0|in entertainment public relations.
20110107153946.000|20110107153948.000|TR0|
20110107153948.000|20110107153950.000|TR0|Tania, you have been doing everything 
20110107153950.000|20110107153953.000|TR0|possible to find a job.
20110107153953.000|20110107153955.000|TR0|
20110107153955.000|20110107153957.000|TR0|TANIA ANDERSON, JOB SEEKER: Yes, Kyra, I 
20110107153957.000|20110107154000.000|TR0|really have.  I've been networking 
20110107154000.000|20110107154002.000|TR0|unbelievably, constantly sending out 
20110107154002.000|20110107154004.000|TR0|resumes.  Sometimes you know, when you 
20110107154004.000|20110107154007.000|TR0|e-mail, you just feel like it goes to 
20110107154007.000|20110107154009.000|TR0|outer space. You know?
20110107154009.000|20110107154011.000|TR0|
20110107154011.000|20110107154014.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes!  A lot of people are 
20110107154014.000|20110107154016.000|TR0|saying it's hard to get face-to-face 
20110107154016.000|20110107154018.000|TR0|interviews nowadays.  So much is done by 
20110107154018.000|20110107154021.000|TR0|Internet and Web sites.  What's been the 
20110107154021.000|20110107154023.000|TR0|hardest part for you, Tonya?
20110107154023.000|20110107154025.000|TR0|
20110107154025.000|20110107154028.000|TR0|ANDERSON:  Oh, my God.  Just trying to 
20110107154028.000|20110107154030.000|TR0|maintain my positive attitude and just 
20110107154030.000|20110107154032.000|TR0|know something good is going to come up.  
20110107154032.000|20110107154034.000|TR0|It's a question of linking up with the 
20110107154034.000|20110107154037.000|TR0|right person, the right employer.  So, I 
20110107154037.000|20110107154039.000|TR0|really appreciate this golden opportunity 
20110107154039.000|20110107154041.000|TR0|you're giving me today.
20110107154041.000|20110107154044.000|TR0|
20110107154044.000|20110107154046.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, it's our pleasure to do 
20110107154046.000|20110107154048.000|TR0|it.  And also, I know you did a lot of 
20110107154048.000|20110107154051.000|TR0|volunteer work with CARE, Habitant for 
20110107154051.000|20110107154053.000|TR0|Humanity and you haven't been able to do 
20110107154053.000|20110107154055.000|TR0|that because of the constant workload, 
20110107154055.000|20110107154058.000|TR0|trying to find a job, right?
20110107154058.000|20110107154100.000|TR0|
20110107154100.000|20110107154102.000|TR0|ANDERSON:  Correct.  Exactly.  Once I'm 
20110107154102.000|20110107154105.000|TR0|back on track, I'll go full speed ahead 
20110107154105.000|20110107154107.000|TR0|with my volunteer work, which is so 
20110107154107.000|20110107154109.000|TR0|valuable and means so much to me.
20110107154109.000|20110107154112.000|TR0|
20110107154112.000|20110107154114.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right, Tania.  Let's get to 
20110107154114.000|20110107154116.000|TR0|it.  You ready for your "30-Second Pitch?
20110107154116.000|20110107154119.000|TR0|
20110107154119.000|20110107154121.000|TR0|ANDERSON:  Yes, I am.
20110107154121.000|20110107154123.000|TR0|
20110107154123.000|20110107154126.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right, we'll start the 
20110107154126.000|20110107154128.000|TR0|clock.  Take it away.
20110107154128.000|20110107154130.000|TR0|
20110107154130.000|20110107154133.000|TR0|ANDERSON:  All right.  I have over five 
20110107154133.000|20110107154135.000|TR0|years experience as a corporate flight

20110107154413.000|20110107154415.000|TR0|this is kind of a procedural vote that's 
20110107154415.000|20110107154417.000|TR0|going on right now.  What we're expecting 
20110107154417.000|20110107154420.000|TR0|next after this is going to be really much 
20110107154420.000|20110107154422.000|TR0|more of a big deal.  The first real vote 
20110107154422.000|20110107154424.000|TR0|on repealing health care reform.  It's 
20110107154424.000|20110107154427.000|TR0|going to be a vote that sets up all of the

20110107154429.000|20110107154431.000|TR0|going to go down next Wednesday, which is

20110107154448.000|20110107154450.000|TR0|contentious issue.  Just a few days now 
20110107154450.000|20110107154452.000|TR0|where Republicans have controlled the 
20110107154452.000|20110107154454.000|TR0|House of Representatives, and they're 
20110107154454.000|20110107154457.000|TR0|really making their statement here right 
20110107154457.000|20110107154459.000|TR0|now that they are challenging President 
20110107154459.000|20110107154501.000|TR0|Obama.  And they're challenging him on 
20110107154501.000|20110107154504.000|TR0|this very important accomplishment from 
20110107154504.000|20110107154506.000|TR0|the White House's perspective of passing 
20110107154506.000|20110107154508.000|TR0|health care reform.

20110107154541.000|20110107154543.000|TR0|And I underscore that again because all

20110107154634.000|20110107154637.000|TR0|this health care overhaul is a job killer, 
20110107154637.000|20110107154639.000|TR0|that it's unconstitutional because it 
20110107154639.000|20110107154641.000|TR0|requires all Americans to get health 
20110107154641.000|20110107154644.000|TR0|insurance.  And then, Kyra, on the flip 
20110107154644.000|20110107154646.000|TR0|side, you have Democrats saying that while 
20110107154646.000|20110107154648.000|TR0|Republicans will say it costs too much, 
20110107154648.000|20110107154651.000|TR0|you have Democrats say if you look at some 
20110107154651.000|20110107154653.000|TR0|recent number from the nonpartisan 
20110107154653.000|20110107154655.000|TR0|Congressional Budget Office that show that

20110107154657.000|20110107154700.000|TR0|the deficit. They're holding up those 
20110107154700.000|20110107154702.000|TR0|numbers and saying this isn't really a 
20110107154702.000|20110107154704.000|TR0|fiscally responsible move and what's more, 
20110107154704.000|20110107154707.000|TR0|it's going to take away benefits from 
20110107154707.000|20110107154709.000|TR0|seniors and young people.  There is a lot

20110107154901.000|20110107154903.000|TR0|Martin.  He actually gave us permission to

20110107155024.000|20110107155026.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Really?  You had special hand

20110107155029.000|20110107155031.000|TR0|
20110107155031.000|20110107155033.000|TR0|What did it feel like to save those lives

20110107155036.000|20110107155038.000|TR0| Did it make you excited?  Did it make you 
20110107155038.000|20110107155040.000|TR0|happy?
20110107155040.000|20110107155043.000|TR0|

20110107155111.000|20110107155113.000|TR0|son said not only did he want to do this 
20110107155113.000|20110107155115.000|TR0|to save lives, but he wanted to meet some 
20110107155115.000|20110107155117.000|TR0|new chicks. Is that true?
20110107155117.000|20110107155120.000|TR0|
20110107155120.000|20110107155122.000|TR0|J. MARTIN:  Well, he's a teenager, you 
20110107155122.000|20110107155124.000|TR0|know.  He does like the young ladies.

20110107155129.000|20110107155131.000|TR0|you get a new girlfriend once they saw you 
20110107155131.000|20110107155134.000|TR0|saving lives?

20110107155141.000|20110107155143.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  He's kind of thinking about 
20110107155143.000|20110107155145.000|TR0|that one.  When I heard him say that -- 
20110107155145.000|20110107155148.000|TR0|so, Jeremy, tell me how this made you feel 
20110107155148.000|20110107155150.000|TR0|when you got to see your son out there in 
20110107155150.000|20110107155152.000|TR0|the Electron Boy outfit and garnering the 
20110107155152.000|20110107155155.000|TR0|attention that he was getting and actually 
20110107155155.000|20110107155157.000|TR0|being a superhero in full force.
20110107155157.000|20110107155159.000|TR0|
20110107155159.000|20110107155202.000|TR0|J. MARTIN:  Well, it was a really 
20110107155202.000|20110107155204.000|TR0|overwhelming day, and he started off, you 
20110107155204.000|20110107155206.000|TR0|know, little uncertain about it all.  But 
20110107155206.000|20110107155209.000|TR0|then when he really got into it, it was so 
20110107155209.000|20110107155211.000|TR0|gratifying.  Because normally, day- 
20110107155211.000|20110107155213.000|TR0|to-day, his energy level has not been very 
20110107155213.000|20110107155216.000|TR0|high, but he was really having fun.  And I 
20110107155216.000|20110107155218.000|TR0|was teary-eyed most of the day.
20110107155218.000|20110107155220.000|TR0|
20110107155220.000|20110107155222.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  I know today's been a bit of a 
20110107155222.000|20110107155225.000|TR0|tough day, and we're so glad we've got you 
20110107155225.000|20110107155227.000|TR0|both with us.  What has Eric told other 
20110107155227.000|20110107155229.000|TR0|kids, Jeremy, about fighting cancer and 
20110107155229.000|20110107155232.000|TR0|staying strong?  How has it impacted his 
20110107155232.000|20110107155234.000|TR0|friends, other cancer patients and of 
20110107155234.000|20110107155236.000|TR0|course, you and your wife, Judy?
20110107155236.000|20110107155239.000|TR0|
20110107155239.000|20110107155241.000|TR0|J. MARTIN:  Some of his friends have come 
20110107155241.000|20110107155243.000|TR0|around to visit him, including a friend he 
20110107155243.000|20110107155246.000|TR0|hadn't seen in a long time, and that's 
20110107155246.000|20110107155248.000|TR0|really great.  I think they're inspired.  
20110107155248.000|20110107155250.000|TR0|But what we've seen is inspiration of 
20110107155250.000|20110107155253.000|TR0|people who have become fans on his 
20110107155253.000|20110107155255.000|TR0|Facebook site, who have got sick kids 
20110107155255.000|20110107155257.000|TR0|themselves.  This has really given them 
20110107155257.000|20110107155300.000|TR0|some hope.  And for us, this is really an 
20110107155300.000|20110107155302.000|TR0|absolutely wonderful legacy he is creating 
20110107155302.000|20110107155304.000|TR0|that we are just so proud of.
