20110107030007.000|20110107030009.000|TR0|ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Hey.  
20110107030009.000|20110107030011.000|TR0|Welcome to 360.  Thanks for joining us.
20110107030011.000|20110107030013.000|TR0|
20110107030013.000|20110107030015.000|TR0|Tonight, the war heats up over child 
20110107030015.000|20110107030017.000|TR0|vaccines and autism.  First, a discredited 
20110107030017.000|20110107030019.000|TR0|doctor had his research declared a fraud.  
20110107030019.000|20110107030021.000|TR0|Then, last night on this program, he 
20110107030021.000|20110107030023.000|TR0|claims he's the victim of a smear campaign 
20110107030023.000|20110107030025.000|TR0|over his autism research.
20110107030025.000|20110107030027.000|TR0|
20110107030027.000|20110107030029.000|TR0|Now you're going to hear from the 
20110107030029.000|20110107030031.000|TR0|investigative reporter he says is smearing 
20110107030031.000|20110107030033.000|TR0|him, the man he calls a hit man sent in to 
20110107030033.000|20110107030036.000|TR0|destroy him, Brian Deer answering the 
20110107030036.000|20110107030038.000|TR0|allegations point by point, "Keeping Them 
20110107030038.000|20110107030040.000|TR0|Honest."
20110107030040.000|20110107030042.000|TR0|
20110107030042.000|20110107030044.000|TR0|We're also "Keeping Them Honest" at the 
20110107030044.000|20110107030046.000|TR0|Pentagon, where, for years, they have had 
20110107030046.000|20110107030048.000|TR0|a list of some 5,200 alleged child 
20110107030048.000|20110107030050.000|TR0|pornography customers who might work for 
20110107030050.000|20110107030052.000|TR0|the Department of Defense.  So, why, 
20110107030052.000|20110107030054.000|TR0|according to a U.S. senator, did they only 
20110107030054.000|20110107030056.000|TR0|check 3,500 or so names and prosecute only 
20110107030056.000|20110107030058.000|TR0|a handful of them before shutting down the 
20110107030058.000|20110107030100.000|TR0|investigation?
20110107030100.000|20110107030103.000|TR0|
20110107030103.000|20110107030105.000|TR0|And later: the murder of Biggie Smalls, a 
20110107030105.000|20110107030107.000|TR0|very public killing, a very cold case, but 
20110107030107.000|20110107030109.000|TR0|now new word of new leads.  The case could 
20110107030109.000|20110107030111.000|TR0|be heating up.  Tonight, we will look at 
20110107030111.000|20110107030113.000|TR0|the investigation with our special guest, 
20110107030113.000|20110107030115.000|TR0|John Walsh of "America's Most Wanted."
20110107030115.000|20110107030117.000|TR0|
20110107030117.000|20110107030119.000|TR0|We begin, though, as always, "Keeping Them 
20110107030119.000|20110107030121.000|TR0|Honest."
20110107030121.000|20110107030123.000|TR0|
20110107030123.000|20110107030125.000|TR0|Tonight, the emotional and bitter debate 
20110107030125.000|20110107030127.000|TR0|over childhood vaccines and autism is 
20110107030127.000|20110107030129.000|TR0|louder than ever, if that's even possible. 
20110107030129.000|20110107030132.000|TR0| Tonight, supporters of Andrew Wakefield, 
20110107030132.000|20110107030134.000|TR0|a discredited doctor who's now accused of 
20110107030134.000|20110107030136.000|TR0|outright fraud by "The British Medical 
20110107030136.000|20110107030138.000|TR0|Journal," "BMJ," are standing by their 
20110107030138.000|20110107030140.000|TR0|man.  To them, he remains a hero and a 
20110107030140.000|20110107030142.000|TR0|victim.
20110107030142.000|20110107030144.000|TR0|
20110107030144.000|20110107030146.000|TR0|Wakefield is the lead author of the 1998 
20110107030146.000|20110107030148.000|TR0|study that triggered a worldwide scare 
20110107030148.000|20110107030150.000|TR0|over childhood vaccines.  It suggested 
20110107030150.000|20110107030152.000|TR0|vaccines given to kids may cause autism.  
20110107030152.000|20110107030154.000|TR0|His study, which looked at just 12 
20110107030154.000|20110107030156.000|TR0|children, has been discredited.  And last 
20110107030156.000|20110107030159.000|TR0|year, "The Lancet," the journal that 
20110107030159.000|20110107030201.000|TR0|originally published it back in 1998, they 
20110107030201.000|20110107030203.000|TR0|retracted the study over concerns about 
20110107030203.000|20110107030205.000|TR0|its methods and ethics, as well as 
20110107030205.000|20110107030207.000|TR0|financial conflicts of the interests -- on 
20110107030207.000|20110107030209.000|TR0|interests on the part of Wakefield.
20110107030209.000|20110107030211.000|TR0|
20110107030211.000|20110107030213.000|TR0|Months later, Wakefield actually lost his 
20110107030213.000|20110107030215.000|TR0|license.  It was taken away, his medical 
20110107030215.000|20110107030217.000|TR0|license, in the U.K.  And now an 
20110107030217.000|20110107030219.000|TR0|award-winning investigative journalist, 
20110107030219.000|20110107030221.000|TR0|Brian Deer, has uncovered evidence he says 
20110107030221.000|20110107030223.000|TR0|proves Wakefield deliberately faked his 
20110107030223.000|20110107030226.000|TR0|study.     Deer lays out his case in a 
20110107030226.000|20110107030228.000|TR0|series of articles that began running last 
20110107030228.000|20110107030230.000|TR0|in the "BMJ" last night.  In a moment, you 
20110107030230.000|20110107030232.000|TR0|are going to hear directly from Mr. Deer.  
20110107030232.000|20110107030234.000|TR0|He will respond to attacks that Andrew 
20110107030234.000|20110107030236.000|TR0|Wakefield made last night in an exclusive 
20110107030236.000|20110107030238.000|TR0|right here on 360.
20110107030238.000|20110107030240.000|TR0|
20110107030240.000|20110107030242.000|TR0|Things got pretty heated.  He denied 
20110107030242.000|20110107030244.000|TR0|point-blank every accusation laid out by 
20110107030244.000|20110107030246.000|TR0|Mr. Deer.  Take a look.

20110107030301.000|20110107030303.000|TR0|COOPER:  Wait a minute, sir.  Let me just 
20110107030303.000|20110107030305.000|TR0|stop you right there.

20110107030311.000|20110107030313.000|TR0|COOPER:  You say he's a hit man and he's 
20110107030313.000|20110107030315.000|TR0|been brought in by "they."  Who is "they"?

20110107030319.000|20110107030322.000|TR0|WAKEFIELD:  Who brought this man in?  Who 
20110107030322.000|20110107030324.000|TR0|is paying this man?  I don't know.
20110107030324.000|20110107030326.000|TR0|
20110107030326.000|20110107030328.000|TR0|COOPER:  You're basically saying this is a 
20110107030328.000|20110107030330.000|TR0|-- some sort of conspiracy against you.  
20110107030330.000|20110107030332.000|TR0|Is that -- is that your argument?
20110107030332.000|20110107030334.000|TR0|
20110107030334.000|20110107030336.000|TR0|WAKEFIELD:  Conspiracy is your word.
20110107030336.000|20110107030338.000|TR0|
20110107030338.000|20110107030340.000|TR0|What this is, is a ruthless, pragmatic 
20110107030340.000|20110107030342.000|TR0|attempt to crush any investigation...
20110107030342.000|20110107030344.000|TR0|

20110107030359.000|20110107030401.000|TR0|COOPER:  However, I have read Brian Deer's 
20110107030401.000|20110107030403.000|TR0|report, which is incredibly extensive.  
20110107030403.000|20110107030405.000|TR0|Sir, I'm not here to let you pitch your 
20110107030405.000|20110107030407.000|TR0|book. I'm here to have you answer

20110107030430.000|20110107030432.000|TR0|your book is also a lie. If your study is 
20110107030432.000|20110107030434.000|TR0|a lie, your book is a lie.
20110107030434.000|20110107030436.000|TR0|

20110107030440.000|20110107030442.000|TR0|I suggest you do your investigation

20110107030457.000|20110107030459.000|TR0|night. If we got something wrong, we would 
20110107030459.000|20110107030501.000|TR0|want to set the record straight, obviously.

20110107030503.000|20110107030505.000|TR0|One point Wakefield was adamant about was

20110107030532.000|20110107030534.000|TR0|WAKEFIELD:  You just accused me of giving 
20110107030534.000|20110107030536.000|TR0|you a falsehood.  I'm telling you that 
20110107030536.000|20110107030538.000|TR0|this work has been replicated in five 
20110107030538.000|20110107030541.000|TR0|countries around the world.

20110107030547.000|20110107030549.000|TR0|COOPER:  Then why has it been completely 
20110107030549.000|20110107030551.000|TR0|discredited by -- by -- by public health 
20110107030551.000|20110107030553.000|TR0|officials around the world?
20110107030553.000|20110107030555.000|TR0|
20110107030555.000|20110107030557.000|TR0|WAKEFIELD:  I suggest you do your 
20110107030557.000|20110107030559.000|TR0|investigation properly before making such 
20110107030559.000|20110107030601.000|TR0|allegations.
20110107030601.000|20110107030603.000|TR0|
20110107030603.000|20110107030605.000|TR0|OK, if you look up the name Gonzalez, if 
20110107030605.000|20110107030608.000|TR0|you look up the name Balzola and Krigsman, 
20110107030608.000|20110107030610.000|TR0|you will see that the work has been 
20110107030610.000|20110107030612.000|TR0|replicated independently by other doctors 
20110107030612.000|20110107030614.000|TR0|around the world.  They fail to mention 
20110107030614.000|20110107030616.000|TR0|that in these allegations.  And Deer has 
20110107030616.000|20110107030618.000|TR0|failed to mention that at any time.  Is 
20110107030618.000|20110107030620.000|TR0|that honest?

20110107030626.000|20110107030628.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, today, we tracked down 
20110107030628.000|20110107030630.000|TR0|three of those studies and spoke to 
20110107030630.000|20110107030632.000|TR0|experts about all five that Wakefield kept 
20110107030632.000|20110107030634.000|TR0|citing.
20110107030634.000|20110107030637.000|TR0|
20110107030637.000|20110107030639.000|TR0|And what we found is, they're basically 
20110107030639.000|20110107030641.000|TR0|beside the point.  They looked at 
20110107030641.000|20110107030643.000|TR0|gastrointestinal problems in children with 
20110107030643.000|20110107030645.000|TR0|autism, and nothing else.  Like Wakefield, 
20110107030645.000|20110107030647.000|TR0|they found an association between 
20110107030647.000|20110107030649.000|TR0|gastrointestinal problems and autism, but 
20110107030649.000|20110107030651.000|TR0|they say nothing at all about a connection 
20110107030651.000|20110107030653.000|TR0|between autism and vaccines.  So his 
20110107030653.000|20110107030655.000|TR0|suggestion of any such link remains his 
20110107030655.000|20110107030657.000|TR0|alone.
20110107030657.000|20110107030659.000|TR0|
20110107030659.000|20110107030701.000|TR0|Now, a lot of parents have stopped 
20110107030701.000|20110107030704.000|TR0|vaccinating their kids because of Mr. 
20110107030704.000|20110107030706.000|TR0|Wakefield's study.  There have been deadly 
20110107030706.000|20110107030708.000|TR0|outbreaks of infectious diseases like 
20110107030708.000|20110107030710.000|TR0|measles and whooping cough as a result.
20110107030710.000|20110107030712.000|TR0|
20110107030712.000|20110107030714.000|TR0|I asked Wakefield about that.
20110107030714.000|20110107030716.000|TR0|

20110107030720.000|20110107030722.000|TR0|COOPER:  Sir, what's also growing in 
20110107030722.000|20110107030724.000|TR0|number is the number of children who have 
20110107030724.000|20110107030726.000|TR0|died because they haven't been vaccinated. 
20110107030726.000|20110107030728.000|TR0| Do you feel any sense of responsibility 
20110107030728.000|20110107030731.000|TR0|for that?
20110107030731.000|20110107030733.000|TR0|
20110107030733.000|20110107030735.000|TR0|WAKEFIELD:  I have never said not 
20110107030735.000|20110107030737.000|TR0|vaccinate.  I have offered, I have 
20110107030737.000|20110107030739.000|TR0|suggested that children have the option of 
20110107030739.000|20110107030741.000|TR0|single vaccines.
20110107030741.000|20110107030743.000|TR0|

20110107030747.000|20110107030749.000|TR0|COOPER:  Now, what he means by that is 
20110107030749.000|20110107030751.000|TR0|giving kids separate vaccines for measles, 
20110107030751.000|20110107030753.000|TR0|mumps and rubella, rather than a 
20110107030753.000|20110107030755.000|TR0|three-in-one combination vaccine.
20110107030755.000|20110107030757.000|TR0|
20110107030757.000|20110107030800.000|TR0|Parents in the U.S. can choose which type 
20110107030800.000|20110107030802.000|TR0|their kids get.  We checked out the rest 
20110107030802.000|20110107030804.000|TR0|of his claim.  And it's true.  We found no 
20110107030804.000|20110107030806.000|TR0|instance of him saying do not vaccinate, 
20110107030806.000|20110107030808.000|TR0|period.
20110107030808.000|20110107030810.000|TR0|
20110107030810.000|20110107030812.000|TR0|In 2003, Wakefield told "The Sunday 
20110107030812.000|20110107030814.000|TR0|Herald" newspaper: "I think parents are 
20110107030814.000|20110107030816.000|TR0|well-informed.  They are not inherently 
20110107030816.000|20110107030818.000|TR0|anti-vaccine, nor are we.  We have 
20110107030818.000|20110107030820.000|TR0|advocated throughout that children 
20110107030820.000|20110107030822.000|TR0|continued to be protected, but, in the 
20110107030822.000|20110107030824.000|TR0|light of this evidence, there's a question 
20110107030824.000|20110107030827.000|TR0|mark.  And while that question mark exist, 
20110107030827.000|20110107030829.000|TR0|parents must have the choice over how they 
20110107030829.000|20110107030831.000|TR0|protect their children."
20110107030831.000|20110107030833.000|TR0|
20110107030833.000|20110107030835.000|TR0|That's what he said.  But, at the same 
20110107030835.000|20110107030837.000|TR0|time, Wakefield is the undisputed champion 
20110107030837.000|20110107030839.000|TR0|of the anti-vaccination movement.  And the 
20110107030839.000|20110107030841.000|TR0|people in this movement commonly cite his 
20110107030841.000|20110107030843.000|TR0|research as the reason for not vaccinating 
20110107030843.000|20110107030845.000|TR0|their kids.
20110107030845.000|20110107030847.000|TR0|
20110107030847.000|20110107030849.000|TR0|Wakefield has never stood up to put a stop 
20110107030849.000|20110107030851.000|TR0|to this movement.  In fact, the forward of 
20110107030851.000|20110107030854.000|TR0|his book, the book he kept trying to 
20110107030854.000|20110107030856.000|TR0|promote last night, is written by Jenny 
20110107030856.000|20110107030858.000|TR0|McCarthy, a vocal autism activist who 
20110107030858.000|20110107030900.000|TR0|believes her son's autism was caused by 
20110107030900.000|20110107030902.000|TR0|vaccines.
20110107030902.000|20110107030904.000|TR0|
20110107030904.000|20110107030906.000|TR0|She writes: "Unfortunately, it appears 
20110107030906.000|20110107030908.000|TR0|that a product intended for good, 
20110107030908.000|20110107030910.000|TR0|vaccines, also has a dark side, which is 
20110107030910.000|20110107030912.000|TR0|the ability to do harm in certain 
20110107030912.000|20110107030914.000|TR0|children.  This ability to do harm has 
20110107030914.000|20110107030916.000|TR0|unfortunately increased quite a bit in the 
20110107030916.000|20110107030918.000|TR0|last few decades because children today 
20110107030918.000|20110107030920.000|TR0|receive so many more shots than when -- 
20110107030920.000|20110107030923.000|TR0|than when most parents were kids."
20110107030923.000|20110107030925.000|TR0|
20110107030925.000|20110107030927.000|TR0|McCarthy also writes that Andrew Wakefield 
20110107030927.000|20110107030929.000|TR0|-- quote -- "listened to parents who 
20110107030929.000|20110107030931.000|TR0|reported two things:  Their children with 
20110107030931.000|20110107030933.000|TR0|autism were suffering from severe bowel 
20110107030933.000|20110107030935.000|TR0|pain, and the children regressed into 
20110107030935.000|20110107030937.000|TR0|autism after vaccination.  He listened.  
20110107030937.000|20110107030939.000|TR0|He studied.  And they published what he 
20110107030939.000|20110107030941.000|TR0|learned."
20110107030941.000|20110107030943.000|TR0|
20110107030943.000|20110107030945.000|TR0|So, even if Wakefield hasn't said do not 
20110107030945.000|20110107030947.000|TR0|vaccinate in so many words, he has 
20110107030947.000|20110107030950.000|TR0|certainly fueled the fear and distrust of 
20110107030950.000|20110107030952.000|TR0|vaccines. Wakefield's publisher released a 
20110107030952.000|20110107030954.000|TR0|statement today on his behalf, and its 
20110107030954.000|20110107030956.000|TR0|headline reads -- quote -- "Vaccines

20110107031008.000|20110107031010.000|TR0|The release goes on to say: "Yesterday, 
20110107031010.000|20110107031012.000|TR0|'The British Medical Journal' published an

20110107031021.000|20110107031023.000|TR0|strong in asserting that the allegations 
20110107031023.000|20110107031025.000|TR0|of 'BMJ' journalist Brian Deer are 
20110107031025.000|20110107031027.000|TR0|entirely false."

20110107031029.000|20110107031031.000|TR0|So, the release itself describes 
20110107031031.000|20110107031033.000|TR0|Wakefield's research as -- quote -- 
20110107031033.000|20110107031035.000|TR0|"suggesting a connection between autism

20110107031039.000|20110107031041.000|TR0|And that's exactly why his study, which 
20110107031041.000|20110107031043.000|TR0|the "BMJ" now says is flat-out fraudulent, 
20110107031043.000|20110107031046.000|TR0|has become such a powerful piece of the

20110107031048.000|20110107031050.000|TR0|
20110107031050.000|20110107031052.000|TR0|Want to show you something else.  This is

20110107031054.000|20110107031056.000|TR0|debunked.  It's a table listing autism 
20110107031056.000|20110107031058.000|TR0|diagnoses in one column and then the 
20110107031058.000|20110107031100.000|TR0|vaccines the kids in the study received. 
20110107031100.000|20110107031102.000|TR0|The table also shows when the kids got the 
20110107031102.000|20110107031104.000|TR0|vaccines.
20110107031104.000|20110107031106.000|TR0|
20110107031106.000|20110107031108.000|TR0|To an average parent, with no scientific 
20110107031108.000|20110107031110.000|TR0|background, that would look pretty scary, 
20110107031110.000|20110107031113.000|TR0|if it were true.  You can see how many 
20110107031113.000|20110107031115.000|TR0|parents desperate for an answer might 
20110107031115.000|20110107031117.000|TR0|latch on to that data.
20110107031117.000|20110107031119.000|TR0|
20110107031119.000|20110107031121.000|TR0|But, after seven years of investigating, 
20110107031121.000|20110107031123.000|TR0|Brian Deer says he's proved the data was 
20110107031123.000|20110107031125.000|TR0|faked.  Here's what told me about when we 
20110107031125.000|20110107031127.000|TR0|talked earlier.

20110107031133.000|20110107031135.000|TR0|COOPER:  Brian, overall, Wakefield is 
20110107031135.000|20110107031137.000|TR0|denying all of -- all of the -- the 
20110107031137.000|20110107031139.000|TR0|evidence that you have put forward in -- 
20110107031139.000|20110107031142.000|TR0|in this -- in this "British Medical

20110107031146.000|20110107031148.000|TR0|
20110107031148.000|20110107031150.000|TR0|BRIAN DEER, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, "THE 
20110107031150.000|20110107031152.000|TR0|SUNDAY TIMES OF LONDON":  Well, two things.
20110107031152.000|20110107031154.000|TR0|
20110107031154.000|20110107031156.000|TR0|One, what else can he do, where else can 
20110107031156.000|20110107031158.000|TR0|he go but to deny it, and to make up even 
20110107031158.000|20110107031200.000|TR0|more tall stories about me, suggesting 
20110107031200.000|20110107031202.000|TR0|that somehow I'm in cahoots with the drug 
20110107031202.000|20110107031204.000|TR0|industry or governments or whoever else.  
20110107031204.000|20110107031206.000|TR0|He's been at that one for years.
20110107031206.000|20110107031209.000|TR0|
20110107031209.000|20110107031211.000|TR0|Secondly, these revelations are not just 
20110107031211.000|20110107031213.000|TR0|my revelations.  They have been checked, 
20110107031213.000|20110107031215.000|TR0|exhaustively, by editors of "The British 
20110107031215.000|20110107031217.000|TR0|Medical Journal," who have peer-reviewed 
20110107031217.000|20110107031219.000|TR0|it, who have gone back into the data 
20110107031219.000|20110107031221.000|TR0|individually and checked back and forth to 
20110107031221.000|20110107031223.000|TR0|have been sure that what I have said is 
20110107031223.000|20110107031225.000|TR0|accurate.  So, it's not just me.

20110107031227.000|20110107031229.000|TR0|So, I think it's just the -- the last

20110107031532.000|20110107031534.000|TR0|DEER:  Well, it was just an absolute

20110107031538.000|20110107031540.000|TR0|There was a television program that had

20110107031859.000|20110107031901.000|TR0|DEER:  I -- I -- I showed the "Lancet" 
20110107031901.000|20110107031904.000|TR0|paper that Wakefield published to a father 
20110107031904.000|20110107031906.000|TR0|of a child in California who is child 
20110107031906.000|20110107031908.000|TR0|number 11 of this series of 12, and he 
20110107031908.000|20110107031910.000|TR0|looked at the paper, and he just looked at 
20110107031910.000|20110107031912.000|TR0|what it said about his own child, and he 
20110107031912.000|20110107031914.000|TR0|said, "That's not true." And that was one 
20110107031914.000|20110107031916.000|TR0|of the parents of one of these children in 
20110107031916.000|20110107031918.000|TR0|the paper.

20110107031920.000|20110107031922.000|TR0|But I think Dr. Wakefield has a -- has a 
20110107031922.000|20110107031924.000|TR0|solution here.  These revelations have 
20110107031924.000|20110107031926.000|TR0|been published in the U.K. jurisdiction, 
20110107031926.000|20110107031928.000|TR0|which is the most onerous libel 
20110107031928.000|20110107031930.000|TR0|jurisdiction in the world.  Dr. Wakefield 
20110107031930.000|20110107031933.000|TR0|should sue, because, if what Dr. Wakefield 
20110107031933.000|20110107031935.000|TR0|is saying is true, then he would have an 
20110107031935.000|20110107031937.000|TR0|easy case for libel against "The British 
20110107031937.000|20110107031939.000|TR0|Medical Journal," against "The Sunday

20110107031943.000|20110107031945.000|TR0|If what he is saying is true, then he must 
20110107031945.000|20110107031947.000|TR0|be the victim of the most sustained 
20110107031947.000|20110107031949.000|TR0|campaign of malicious libel that has ever 
20110107031949.000|20110107031951.000|TR0|been inflicted on any individual in

20110107032010.000|20110107032012.000|TR0|But the reason he doesn't take this remedy 
20110107032012.000|20110107032014.000|TR0|-- in fact, he tried to take this remedy 
20110107032014.000|20110107032016.000|TR0|once before, when the doctors' Medical 
20110107032016.000|20110107032018.000|TR0|Protection Society was funding him to sue 
20110107032018.000|20110107032020.000|TR0|me, sue the television company, sue "The 
20110107032020.000|20110107032022.000|TR0|Sunday Times."  And what happened at the 
20110107032022.000|20110107032024.000|TR0|end?  He discontinued his action, and he 
20110107032024.000|20110107032026.000|TR0|sent me a check.  I actually received a 
20110107032026.000|20110107032029.000|TR0|check from his lawyers to pay my legal 
20110107032029.000|20110107032031.000|TR0|costs.

20110107032033.000|20110107032035.000|TR0|Dr. Wakefield has a remedy.  The trouble 
20110107032035.000|20110107032037.000|TR0|is, he can't take that remedy, because 
20110107032037.000|20110107032039.000|TR0|he's a fraudster.  And, after all these 
20110107032039.000|20110107032041.000|TR0|years, he's finally been nailed.  We have 
20110107032041.000|20110107032043.000|TR0|been able to, over the years, produce the 
20110107032043.000|20110107032045.000|TR0|evidence that he was being paid by 
20110107032045.000|20110107032047.000|TR0|lawyers.  We were able to show that he 
20110107032047.000|20110107032049.000|TR0|received three-quarters-of-a-million U.S. 
20110107032049.000|20110107032051.000|TR0|dollars.

20110107032058.000|20110107032100.000|TR0|extraordinary sums of money he intended to 
20110107032100.000|20110107032102.000|TR0|make from his own vaccine, from diagnostic 
20110107032102.000|20110107032104.000|TR0|kits, and from all kinds of other weird 
20110107032104.000|20110107032106.000|TR0|products he was going to sell off the back

20110107032112.000|20110107032114.000|TR0|And, finally, he's been nailed as a cheat 
20110107032114.000|20110107032116.000|TR0|and a fraudster, and not just in a sort of 
20110107032116.000|20110107032118.000|TR0|academic vanity sense, but in an area of 
20110107032118.000|20110107032120.000|TR0|where children's lives have been put at 
20110107032120.000|20110107032123.000|TR0|risk, and, even more importantly, in a 
20110107032123.000|20110107032125.000|TR0|funny way, where parents of children with 
20110107032125.000|20110107032127.000|TR0|autism have been left to blame themselves, 
20110107032127.000|20110107032129.000|TR0|thinking it was their own fault for 
20110107032129.000|20110107032131.000|TR0|vaccinating their child that their child

20110107032149.000|20110107032152.000|TR0|believe in Wakefield or believe the 
20110107032152.000|20110107032154.000|TR0|research, and are angry at -- at, you 
20110107032154.000|20110107032156.000|TR0|know, our reporting on this, angry, 
20110107032156.000|20110107032158.000|TR0|certainly, at your reporting on this.  I'm 
20110107032158.000|20110107032200.000|TR0|sure you have heard from them many times 
20110107032200.000|20110107032202.000|TR0|over the years.
20110107032202.000|20110107032204.000|TR0|
20110107032204.000|20110107032206.000|TR0|DEER:  Oh, yes.
20110107032206.000|20110107032208.000|TR0|
20110107032208.000|20110107032210.000|TR0|COOPER:  And it is heartbreaking, because 
20110107032210.000|20110107032212.000|TR0|there is no answer for what is causing 
20110107032212.000|20110107032214.000|TR0|autism.  And, clearly, there have been 
20110107032214.000|20110107032216.000|TR0|problems with vaccines in the past.
20110107032216.000|20110107032219.000|TR0|
20110107032219.000|20110107032221.000|TR0|What do you -- what do you tell parents?  
20110107032221.000|20110107032223.000|TR0|What do you say to them?
20110107032223.000|20110107032225.000|TR0|
20110107032225.000|20110107032227.000|TR0|DEER:  Well, I say to -- I say to parents 
20110107032227.000|20110107032229.000|TR0|when I talk to them -- and, you know, you 
20110107032229.000|20110107032231.000|TR0|discuss these things with them, and I will 
20110107032231.000|20110107032233.000|TR0|tell you, the killer question to ask these 
20110107032233.000|20110107032235.000|TR0|parents, if you get an even conversation 
20110107032235.000|20110107032237.000|TR0|with them, is to say, do you blame 
20110107032237.000|20110107032239.000|TR0|yourself?
20110107032239.000|20110107032241.000|TR0|
20110107032241.000|20110107032243.000|TR0|And they do.  And I have had parents 
20110107032243.000|20110107032246.000|TR0|absolutely break down in tears, blaming 
20110107032246.000|20110107032248.000|TR0|themselves, thinking it was their fault 
20110107032248.000|20110107032250.000|TR0|for vaccinating their child.
20110107032250.000|20110107032252.000|TR0|
20110107032252.000|20110107032254.000|TR0|Now, what Dr. Wakefield is able to do is 
20110107032254.000|20110107032256.000|TR0|to take that energy of guilt and 
20110107032256.000|20110107032258.000|TR0|self-blame, which is quite understandable, 
20110107032258.000|20110107032300.000|TR0|but is quite wrong, take that, exploit it, 
20110107032300.000|20110107032302.000|TR0|turn it into money, turn it into a 
20110107032302.000|20110107032304.000|TR0|business.  And that's what he's done.  And 
20110107032304.000|20110107032306.000|TR0|he's having a wonderful time in Jamaica.  
20110107032306.000|20110107032308.000|TR0|I saw you interviewed him in Jamaica.  
20110107032308.000|20110107032310.000|TR0|Very nice.
20110107032310.000|20110107032312.000|TR0|
20110107032312.000|20110107032315.000|TR0|COOPER:  Wakefield claims that -- that his 
20110107032315.000|20110107032317.000|TR0|findings have been independently 
20110107032317.000|20110107032319.000|TR0|replicated.  Is that true?
20110107032319.000|20110107032321.000|TR0|
20110107032321.000|20110107032323.000|TR0|DEER:  That's completely false.
20110107032323.000|20110107032325.000|TR0|
20110107032325.000|20110107032327.000|TR0|COOPER:  I mean, he said they have been 
20110107032327.000|20110107032329.000|TR0|replicated in five countries around the 
20110107032329.000|20110107032331.000|TR0|world.  That was news to me.
20110107032331.000|20110107032333.000|TR0|
20110107032333.000|20110107032335.000|TR0|DEER:  Completely false.  That's 
20110107032335.000|20110107032337.000|TR0|absolutely, completely false.     What he 
20110107032337.000|20110107032339.000|TR0|does is what he's been doing in front of 
20110107032339.000|20110107032342.000|TR0|these parents over many years.  He takes 
20110107032342.000|20110107032344.000|TR0|tangential pieces of research that don't 
20110107032344.000|20110107032346.000|TR0|really relate to what he's saying and 
20110107032346.000|20110107032348.000|TR0|represent them as somehow endorsing what 
20110107032348.000|20110107032350.000|TR0|he said.
20110107032350.000|20110107032352.000|TR0|
20110107032352.000|20110107032354.000|TR0|One of the papers in fact which he cites 
20110107032354.000|20110107032356.000|TR0|absolutely, explicitly denies that 
20110107032356.000|20110107032358.000|TR0|anything like what he suggests has been 
20110107032358.000|20110107032400.000|TR0|found.
20110107032400.000|20110107032402.000|TR0|
20110107032402.000|20110107032404.000|TR0|COOPER:  He -- he also...
20110107032404.000|20110107032406.000|TR0|
20110107032406.000|20110107032409.000|TR0|DEER:  He just makes it up.
20110107032409.000|20110107032411.000|TR0|
20110107032411.000|20110107032413.000|TR0|COOPER:  He also claims that -- that he 
20110107032413.000|20110107032415.000|TR0|wasn't making a connection between 
20110107032415.000|20110107032417.000|TR0|vaccines and -- and -- and autism, that -- 
20110107032417.000|20110107032419.000|TR0|that it was parents who -- who started 
20110107032419.000|20110107032421.000|TR0|making that, that the purpose of the study 
20110107032421.000|20110107032423.000|TR0|wasn't to look at possible associations 
20110107032423.000|20110107032425.000|TR0|between MMR vaccinations and autism, but 
20110107032425.000|20110107032427.000|TR0|that association came from parents.
20110107032427.000|20110107032429.000|TR0|
20110107032429.000|20110107032431.000|TR0|DEER:  No, he just makes it up.
20110107032431.000|20110107032433.000|TR0|
20110107032433.000|20110107032435.000|TR0|Those parents were selected by him and the 
20110107032435.000|20110107032438.000|TR0|lawyer and the campaign groups -- 
20110107032438.000|20110107032440.000|TR0|actually, a campaign group organized by a 
20110107032440.000|20110107032442.000|TR0|mother who doesn't have a child with 
20110107032442.000|20110107032444.000|TR0|autism, does have a grievously disabled 
20110107032444.000|20110107032446.000|TR0|child who I saw in a CNN bulletin just 10 
20110107032446.000|20110107032448.000|TR0|minutes ago.
20110107032448.000|20110107032450.000|TR0|
20110107032450.000|20110107032452.000|TR0|These people together selected a group of 
20110107032452.000|20110107032454.000|TR0|parents who blamed MMR and brought them to 
20110107032454.000|20110107032456.000|TR0|the hospital for them to make that 
20110107032456.000|20110107032458.000|TR0|allegation. That's one of the key ways in 
20110107032458.000|20110107032500.000|TR0|which this research was rigged.  He knew 
20110107032500.000|20110107032502.000|TR0|who these parents were.  He would 
20110107032502.000|20110107032505.000|TR0|telephone them at their homes, invite them 
20110107032505.000|20110107032507.000|TR0|to the hospital, bring them in and get 
20110107032507.000|20110107032509.000|TR0|them to make the allegations to other 
20110107032509.000|20110107032511.000|TR0|doctors.
20110107032511.000|20110107032513.000|TR0|
20110107032513.000|20110107032515.000|TR0|COOPER:  What has angered you most or 
20110107032515.000|20110107032517.000|TR0|surprised you most in the years now since 
20110107032517.000|20110107032519.000|TR0|2003 that you have been looking into and 
20110107032519.000|20110107032521.000|TR0|investigating this?
20110107032521.000|20110107032523.000|TR0|
20110107032523.000|20110107032525.000|TR0|DEER:  What has angered or surprised me 
20110107032525.000|20110107032527.000|TR0|most?
20110107032527.000|20110107032529.000|TR0|
20110107032529.000|20110107032531.000|TR0|I think what has angered me most is the -- 
20110107032531.000|20110107032534.000|TR0|is the distraction away from the real 
20110107032534.000|20110107032536.000|TR0|needs of children with developmental 
20110107032536.000|20110107032538.000|TR0|disorders and the real needs of families 
20110107032538.000|20110107032540.000|TR0|who are looking after them, because, very 
20110107032540.000|20110107032542.000|TR0|often, the families of children, 
20110107032542.000|20110107032544.000|TR0|particularly the ones that Wakefield preys 
20110107032544.000|20110107032546.000|TR0|on, are people who are just desperate for 
20110107032546.000|20110107032548.000|TR0|answers.
20110107032548.000|20110107032550.000|TR0|
20110107032550.000|20110107032552.000|TR0|Some of them are financially quite 
20110107032552.000|20110107032554.000|TR0|challenged as well.  Many of them are -- 
20110107032554.000|20110107032556.000|TR0|are -- are terrified about what's going to 
20110107032556.000|20110107032558.000|TR0|happen to their children in the future.  
20110107032558.000|20110107032601.000|TR0|And it's really shocked me that somebody 
20110107032601.000|20110107032603.000|TR0|would really prey upon the vulnerable.
20110107032603.000|20110107032605.000|TR0|
20110107032605.000|20110107032607.000|TR0|It's almost as though, if you're 
20110107032607.000|20110107032609.000|TR0|vulnerable, you get picked on. It's almost 
20110107032609.000|20110107032611.000|TR0|as -- it's almost an animal thing that -- 
20110107032611.000|20110107032613.000|TR0|that people prey on these -- these really 
20110107032613.000|20110107032615.000|TR0|unfortunate families who have got a -- who 
20110107032615.000|20110107032617.000|TR0|have got issues.
20110107032617.000|20110107032619.000|TR0|
20110107032619.000|20110107032621.000|TR0|And I -- I just think it's a shame that 
20110107032621.000|20110107032623.000|TR0|the energy that has gone into this 
20110107032623.000|20110107032625.000|TR0|anti-vaccine campaign hasn't gone into a 
20110107032625.000|20110107032628.000|TR0|campaign for better services for people 
20110107032628.000|20110107032630.000|TR0|with disabilities, more research to get to 
20110107032630.000|20110107032632.000|TR0|the bottom of these kind of problems.  I 
20110107032632.000|20110107032634.000|TR0|think it's a great tragedy, great 
20110107032634.000|20110107032636.000|TR0|diversion of resources.

20110107032657.000|20110107032659.000|TR0|resources for a mysterious and terrifying 
20110107032659.000|20110107032701.000|TR0|threat and one that is growing.
20110107032701.000|20110107032703.000|TR0|
20110107032703.000|20110107032705.000|TR0|I want to show you the numbers that 
20110107032705.000|20110107032707.000|TR0|explain the fear.  According to the

20110107032713.000|20110107032715.000|TR0|That's just under 1 percent, according to 
20110107032715.000|20110107032717.000|TR0|the most recent data from 2006.
20110107032717.000|20110107032719.000|TR0|
20110107032719.000|20110107032721.000|TR0|The number of cases has been growing since 
20110107032721.000|20110107032724.000|TR0|2002.  There's no doubt about it.  Now, 
20110107032724.000|20110107032726.000|TR0|the rate varies among states, and it's 
20110107032726.000|20110107032728.000|TR0|important to point out that autism 
20110107032728.000|20110107032730.000|TR0|spectrum disorder includes a -- a range of 
20110107032730.000|20110107032732.000|TR0|developmental disabilities,with the most 
20110107032732.000|20110107032734.000|TR0|severe being autism.
20110107032734.000|20110107032736.000|TR0|
20110107032736.000|20110107032738.000|TR0|There have also been changes in how 
20110107032738.000|20110107032740.000|TR0|diagnoses are made.  And that may explain 
20110107032740.000|20110107032742.000|TR0|some of the increase, but not all of it, 
20110107032742.000|20110107032744.000|TR0|according to experts.  Something else you 
20110107032744.000|20110107032746.000|TR0|should know, boys are four to five times 
20110107032746.000|20110107032748.000|TR0|more likely than girls to develop an 
20110107032748.000|20110107032751.000|TR0|autism spectrum disorder.
20110107032751.000|20110107032753.000|TR0|
20110107032753.000|20110107032755.000|TR0|And while there's no known cause yet, 
20110107032755.000|20110107032757.000|TR0|clues are emerging.  It's estimated that 
20110107032757.000|20110107032759.000|TR0|about 10 percent of kids with autism 
20110107032759.000|20110107032801.000|TR0|spectrum disorders have a genetic and 
20110107032801.000|20110107032803.000|TR0|neurologic or metabolic disorder, such as 
20110107032803.000|20110107032805.000|TR0|fragile X or Down syndrome.
20110107032805.000|20110107032807.000|TR0|
20110107032807.000|20110107032809.000|TR0|Autism spectrum disorder is obviously an 
20110107032809.000|20110107032811.000|TR0|incredibly heartbreaking diagnosis for 
20110107032811.000|20110107032813.000|TR0|parents.  It's also extremely costly for 
20110107032813.000|20110107032815.000|TR0|both the families and the health care 
20110107032815.000|20110107032817.000|TR0|system.  According to a recent study, the 
20110107032817.000|20110107032820.000|TR0|estimated lifetime cost to care for 
20110107032820.000|20110107032822.000|TR0|someone with an autism spectrum disorder 
20110107032822.000|20110107032824.000|TR0|is $3.2 million.

20110107032840.000|20110107032842.000|TR0|government, even for the U.S. military.  
20110107032842.000|20110107032844.000|TR0|Four years after a sting operation turned 
20110107032844.000|20110107032847.000|TR0|up 5,200 potential military suspects, 
20110107032847.000|20110107032849.000|TR0|1,700 got no investigation, according to a 
20110107032849.000|20110107032851.000|TR0|U.S. senator. The question is what 
20110107032851.000|20110107032853.000|TR0|happened back then and what's being done 
20110107032853.000|20110107032855.000|TR0|now to fix it.  We're "Keeping Them

20110107032920.000|20110107032922.000|TR0|COOPER:  "Keeping Them Honest" tonight: 
20110107032922.000|20110107032924.000|TR0|potentially hundreds of military employees 
20110107032924.000|20110107032926.000|TR0|and contractors who may have bought child 
20110107032926.000|20110107032928.000|TR0|pornography online, but haven't been 
20110107032928.000|20110107032930.000|TR0|prosecuted or even in some cases 
20110107032930.000|20110107032932.000|TR0|investigated.
20110107032932.000|20110107032934.000|TR0|
20110107032934.000|20110107032936.000|TR0|That's right.  You heard me, child 
20110107032936.000|20110107032938.000|TR0|pornography -- as many as 1,700 names, 
20110107032938.000|20110107032940.000|TR0|according to a U.S. senator, on a list of 
20110107032940.000|20110107032943.000|TR0|5,200 from an Internet sting operation 
20110107032943.000|20110107032945.000|TR0|overlooked the first time around four 
20110107032945.000|20110107032947.000|TR0|years ago.  Only now are they supposedly 
20110107032947.000|20110107032949.000|TR0|getting a second look, and only after 
20110107032949.000|20110107032951.000|TR0|pressure from investigative reporters and 
20110107032951.000|20110107032953.000|TR0|the U.S. senator you're about to hear 
20110107032953.000|20110107032955.000|TR0|from, Republican Charles Grassley.
20110107032955.000|20110107032957.000|TR0|
20110107032957.000|20110107032959.000|TR0|The Pentagon porn story began in 2006.  An 
20110107032959.000|20110107033001.000|TR0|Immigration and Customs Enforcement child 
20110107033001.000|20110107033003.000|TR0|pornography sting operation called Project 
20110107033003.000|20110107033005.000|TR0|Flicker produced payment records of about 
20110107033005.000|20110107033007.000|TR0|5,200 people, many of whom provided Army 
20110107033007.000|20110107033010.000|TR0|or fleet zip codes or military e-mail 
20110107033010.000|20110107033012.000|TR0|addresses.
20110107033012.000|20110107033014.000|TR0|
20110107033014.000|20110107033016.000|TR0|Subsequently, the Pentagon's investigative 
20110107033016.000|20110107033018.000|TR0|branch, DCIS, began going through the ICE 
20110107033018.000|20110107033020.000|TR0|list to identify who actually was a DOD 
20110107033020.000|20110107033022.000|TR0|employee or a contractor.  The 
20110107033022.000|20110107033024.000|TR0|investigation, however, only ran for eight 
20110107033024.000|20110107033026.000|TR0|months, and only cross-checked some 3,500 
20110107033026.000|20110107033028.000|TR0|names for Pentagon ties, according to a 
20110107033028.000|20110107033030.000|TR0|senator.
20110107033030.000|20110107033032.000|TR0|
20110107033032.000|20110107033034.000|TR0|According to DCIS documents revealed in a 
20110107033034.000|20110107033036.000|TR0|Freedom of Information Act request, out of 
20110107033036.000|20110107033039.000|TR0|that 3,500, investigators uncovered 264 
20110107033039.000|20110107033041.000|TR0|employees or contractors, including 
20110107033041.000|20110107033043.000|TR0|staffers for the secretary of defense and 
20110107033043.000|20110107033045.000|TR0|contractors at the NSA.  Nine people had 
20110107033045.000|20110107033047.000|TR0|top security clearances.
20110107033047.000|20110107033049.000|TR0|
20110107033049.000|20110107033051.000|TR0|But only about 20 percent of those 264 
20110107033051.000|20110107033053.000|TR0|people were completely investigated.  
20110107033053.000|20110107033055.000|TR0|Fewer still were prosecuted, and about 
20110107033055.000|20110107033057.000|TR0|eight months -- after about eight months, 
20110107033057.000|20110107033059.000|TR0|the entire probe was halted.  It left 
20110107033059.000|20110107033101.000|TR0|about 1,700 names totally unchecked, 1,700 
20110107033101.000|20110107033103.000|TR0|alleged kiddie porn customers, an unknown 
20110107033103.000|20110107033106.000|TR0|number of whom may still work in some 
20110107033106.000|20110107033108.000|TR0|capacity for the Defense Department.

20110107033110.000|20110107033112.000|TR0|Late last summer, after investigations by 
20110107033112.000|20110107033114.000|TR0|"The Boston Globe" and Yahoo! News 
20110107033114.000|20110107033116.000|TR0|revealed the figures, a Pentagon spokesman 
20110107033116.000|20110107033118.000|TR0|promised to reopen the investigation, 
20110107033118.000|20110107033120.000|TR0|conceding that DCIS had stopped due to 
20110107033120.000|20110107033122.000|TR0|lack of resources.  DCIS says it is now 
20110107033122.000|20110107033124.000|TR0|revisiting all 5,200 names, telling 
20110107033124.000|20110107033126.000|TR0|Senator's Grassley staff they have now 
20110107033126.000|20110107033128.000|TR0|identified 302 employees or staffers.
20110107033128.000|20110107033130.000|TR0|
20110107033130.000|20110107033133.000|TR0|The Pentagon's I.G. telling us -- and I 
20110107033133.000|20110107033135.000|TR0|quote -- "Any suggestion that the DOD 
20110107033135.000|20110107033137.000|TR0|Office of Inspector General or its 
20110107033137.000|20110107033139.000|TR0|criminal investigative arm, the DCIS, is 
20110107033139.000|20110107033141.000|TR0|not taking Operation Flicker and the issue 
20110107033141.000|20110107033143.000|TR0|of child pornography seriously is in 
20110107033143.000|20110107033145.000|TR0|error."

20110107033147.000|20110107033149.000|TR0|But Senator Grassley says he is still not 
20110107033149.000|20110107033151.000|TR0|getting the cooperation he needs from the 
20110107033151.000|20110107033153.000|TR0|Pentagon.

20110107033155.000|20110107033157.000|TR0|I spoke to him earlier.

20110107033159.000|20110107033202.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)     COOPER:  Senator 
20110107033202.000|20110107033204.000|TR0|Grassley, you were told that 5,200 Defense 
20110107033204.000|20110107033206.000|TR0|Department employees had allegedly 
20110107033206.000|20110107033208.000|TR0|purchased child porn.  And yet you're 
20110107033208.000|20110107033210.000|TR0|saying only 3,500 of those names were 
20110107033210.000|20110107033212.000|TR0|cross-checked by a Defense investigator to 
20110107033212.000|20110107033214.000|TR0|see if they were really DOD personnel.  
20110107033214.000|20110107033216.000|TR0|That's mind-boggling.  Why weren't all of 
20110107033216.000|20110107033218.000|TR0|them cross-checked?
20110107033218.000|20110107033220.000|TR0|
20110107033220.000|20110107033222.000|TR0|SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), IOWA:  Well, we 
20110107033222.000|20110107033224.000|TR0|don't have an answer to that question, but 
20110107033224.000|20110107033226.000|TR0|it's quite obvious that the other 1,700 
20110107033226.000|20110107033229.000|TR0|should have been cross-checked.  And 
20110107033229.000|20110107033231.000|TR0|that's one of the answers to my questions 
20110107033231.000|20110107033233.000|TR0|that I want answered.
20110107033233.000|20110107033235.000|TR0|
20110107033235.000|20110107033237.000|TR0|And the implication of our question is, 
20110107033237.000|20110107033239.000|TR0|they ought to be cross- checked.  We ought 
20110107033239.000|20110107033241.000|TR0|to find out, because we're talking about 
20110107033241.000|20110107033243.000|TR0|not just general pornography here.  We're 
20110107033243.000|20110107033245.000|TR0|talking about child pornography.  And 
20110107033245.000|20110107033247.000|TR0|child pornography, taking that down, is a 
20110107033247.000|20110107033249.000|TR0|crime.  And, also, it's -- there's an 
20110107033249.000|20110107033251.000|TR0|added factor here, considering the fact 
20110107033251.000|20110107033253.000|TR0|that there's a lot of security 
20110107033253.000|20110107033256.000|TR0|information, national security information 
20110107033256.000|20110107033258.000|TR0|that the world shouldn't know, that a lot 
20110107033258.000|20110107033300.000|TR0|of times foreign operatives will use this 
20110107033300.000|20110107033302.000|TR0|sort of criminal activity to blackmail, to 
20110107033302.000|20110107033304.000|TR0|get information.
20110107033304.000|20110107033306.000|TR0|
20110107033306.000|20110107033308.000|TR0|So, there's a lot of things that are 
20110107033308.000|20110107033310.000|TR0|involved because it's a Defense Department 
20110107033310.000|20110107033312.000|TR0|issue, as opposed to any other department 
20110107033312.000|20110107033314.000|TR0|of government.
20110107033314.000|20110107033316.000|TR0|
20110107033316.000|20110107033318.000|TR0|COOPER:  Right.  Sir, I mean, if your 
20110107033318.000|20110107033320.000|TR0|numbers are correct, 1,700 people out 
20110107033320.000|20110107033322.000|TR0|there who allegedly purchased child porn, 
20110107033322.000|20110107033325.000|TR0|we don't know if they were ever 
20110107033325.000|20110107033327.000|TR0|cross-checked or investigated, right?
20110107033327.000|20110107033329.000|TR0|
20110107033329.000|20110107033331.000|TR0|GRASSLEY:  That's true.
20110107033331.000|20110107033333.000|TR0|
20110107033333.000|20110107033335.000|TR0|And there's been some other names, in the 
20110107033335.000|20110107033337.000|TR0|hundreds, where there's -- the names have 
20110107033337.000|20110107033339.000|TR0|actually been given out that we don't know 
20110107033339.000|20110107033341.000|TR0|what's going to be done about them.  Now, 
20110107033341.000|20110107033343.000|TR0|there's some reason to believe that the -- 
20110107033343.000|20110107033345.000|TR0|it's a criminal act.
20110107033345.000|20110107033347.000|TR0|
20110107033347.000|20110107033349.000|TR0|The -- it's been so far since this 
20110107033349.000|20110107033352.000|TR0|happened, that they could be stale.  Maybe 
20110107033352.000|20110107033354.000|TR0|you can't have criminal prosecution.  But 
20110107033354.000|20110107033356.000|TR0|we would be looking at administrative 
20110107033356.000|20110107033358.000|TR0|action to be taken against these people, 
20110107033358.000|20110107033400.000|TR0|and I want to know who they are and what 
20110107033400.000|20110107033402.000|TR0|administrative action is being taken.
20110107033402.000|20110107033404.000|TR0|
20110107033404.000|20110107033406.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes, because, I mean, what's even 
20110107033406.000|20110107033408.000|TR0|more startling is that, of the 302 people 
20110107033408.000|20110107033410.000|TR0|confirmed as DOD personnel or contractors, 
20110107033410.000|20110107033412.000|TR0|only 70 of them were actually 
20110107033412.000|20110107033414.000|TR0|investigated.  I mean, how is it possible 
20110107033414.000|20110107033416.000|TR0|that -- that all of them weren't 
20110107033416.000|20110107033419.000|TR0|investigated?
20110107033419.000|20110107033421.000|TR0|
20110107033421.000|20110107033423.000|TR0|GRASSLEY:  Yes.
20110107033423.000|20110107033425.000|TR0|
20110107033425.000|20110107033427.000|TR0|Well, here's, I think, the thing that 
20110107033427.000|20110107033429.000|TR0|overrides everything you just asked, and 
20110107033429.000|20110107033431.000|TR0|that is, we asked criminal investigators 
20110107033431.000|20110107033433.000|TR0|in the division of defense that does that 
20110107033433.000|20110107033435.000|TR0|the extent to which supervisors of these 
20110107033435.000|20110107033437.000|TR0|people knew that this was going, and the 
20110107033437.000|20110107033439.000|TR0|-- and the criminal investigators couldn't 
20110107033439.000|20110107033441.000|TR0|even answer that question for us when we 
20110107033441.000|20110107033443.000|TR0|had a briefing from them.
20110107033443.000|20110107033445.000|TR0|
20110107033445.000|20110107033448.000|TR0|COOPER:  So, wait a minute.  So, you're 
20110107033448.000|20110107033450.000|TR0|saying we don't even know if the 
20110107033450.000|20110107033452.000|TR0|supervisors of these people were told that 
20110107033452.000|20110107033454.000|TR0|their -- their, you know, employees may 
20110107033454.000|20110107033456.000|TR0|have downloaded child porn?
20110107033456.000|20110107033458.000|TR0|
20110107033458.000|20110107033500.000|TR0|GRASSLEY:  That's the question that my 
20110107033500.000|20110107033502.000|TR0|staff asked of the criminal investigators, 
20110107033502.000|20110107033504.000|TR0|and they could not answer the question 
20110107033504.000|20110107033506.000|TR0|whether or not supervisors had been 
20110107033506.000|20110107033508.000|TR0|informed of this.
20110107033508.000|20110107033510.000|TR0|
20110107033510.000|20110107033512.000|TR0|And if the supervisors don't know about 
20110107033512.000|20110107033515.000|TR0|it, you know, it's a bad environment, that 
20110107033515.000|20110107033517.000|TR0|things like this can happen in the first 
20110107033517.000|20110107033519.000|TR0|place, and, worse, that it's a criminal 
20110107033519.000|20110107033521.000|TR0|act when things are downloaded.
20110107033521.000|20110107033523.000|TR0|
20110107033523.000|20110107033525.000|TR0|COOPER:  Until you started raising this 
20110107033525.000|20110107033527.000|TR0|issue, I mean, this investigation was 
20110107033527.000|20110107033529.000|TR0|closed by the Defense Department.  They 
20110107033529.000|20110107033531.000|TR0|had only investigated it for about eight 
20110107033531.000|20110107033533.000|TR0|months.  Do you think the Pentagon just 
20110107033533.000|20110107033535.000|TR0|didn't take this seriously?
20110107033535.000|20110107033537.000|TR0|
20110107033537.000|20110107033539.000|TR0|GRASSLEY:  Well, it's quite obvious that 
20110107033539.000|20110107033541.000|TR0|they didn't take it seriously, because it 
20110107033541.000|20110107033544.000|TR0|wasn't only that I was asking the 
20110107033544.000|20110107033546.000|TR0|questions.  It wasn't until it started 
20110107033546.000|20110107033548.000|TR0|getting questions from people like you who 
20110107033548.000|20110107033550.000|TR0|are journalists that -- that this got 
20110107033550.000|20110107033552.000|TR0|their attention and we got any 
20110107033552.000|20110107033554.000|TR0|consideration and reopening of this in the 
20110107033554.000|20110107033556.000|TR0|-- in the first place.
20110107033556.000|20110107033558.000|TR0|
20110107033558.000|20110107033600.000|TR0|COOPER:  One of your staffers told us that 
20110107033600.000|20110107033602.000|TR0|getting information from the Defense 
20110107033602.000|20110107033604.000|TR0|Department on this has been like pulling 
20110107033604.000|20110107033606.000|TR0|teeth.  Is that how you would describe it?
20110107033606.000|20110107033608.000|TR0|
20110107033608.000|20110107033611.000|TR0|GRASSLEY:  Oh, I have been involved in 
20110107033611.000|20110107033613.000|TR0|oversight of the Defense Department for 
20110107033613.000|20110107033615.000|TR0|almost all the years I have been in the 
20110107033615.000|20110107033617.000|TR0|United States Senate.  And it's very 
20110107033617.000|20110107033619.000|TR0|difficult to get answers from a lot of 
20110107033619.000|20110107033621.000|TR0|bureaucracies, but it's quite more 
20110107033621.000|20110107033623.000|TR0|difficult in the Defense Department.
20110107033623.000|20110107033625.000|TR0|
20110107033625.000|20110107033627.000|TR0|COOPER:  Senator Grassley, I appreciate 
20110107033627.000|20110107033629.000|TR0|your time.  We will continue to follow

20110107033727.000|20110107033729.000|TR0|Biggie Smalls.  Nearly 15 years later,

20110107033742.000|20110107033744.000|TR0|incendiary devices were mailed to two

20110107033746.000|20110107033748.000|TR0|packages that looked like books.  Two

20110107033750.000|20110107033752.000|TR0|they opened the packages, one addressed to

20110107033832.000|20110107033834.000|TR0|to better track their location and

20110107033838.000|20110107033840.000|TR0|heavy snow just a few weeks ago left many

20110107033848.000|20110107033850.000|TR0|today's issue of "Science" magazine.  It 
20110107033850.000|20110107033852.000|TR0|found that the smell of a woman's tears 
20110107033852.000|20110107033854.000|TR0|can dramatically reduce men's testosterone 
20110107033854.000|20110107033857.000|TR0|levels.

20110107034030.000|20110107034032.000|TR0|that's literally notorious, the murder of 
20110107034032.000|20110107034034.000|TR0|Notorious BIG, also known as Biggie

20110107034044.000|20110107034046.000|TR0|there could be a break in one of them, 
20110107034046.000|20110107034049.000|TR0|we're told.  A law-enforcement source

20110107034124.000|20110107034126.000|TR0|1996.  Mike Tyson is fighting Bruce

20110107034134.000|20110107034136.000|TR0|After the fight, Shakur rode with his 
20110107034136.000|20110107034138.000|TR0|boss, Suge Knight, CEO of Death Row 
20110107034138.000|20110107034140.000|TR0|Records, to a party just off the Las Vegas 
20110107034140.000|20110107034143.000|TR0|strip.  Their security team went in 
20110107034143.000|20110107034145.000|TR0|separate cars.

20110107034147.000|20110107034149.000|TR0|Knight was behind the wheel, Shakur in the 
20110107034149.000|20110107034151.000|TR0|front passenger seat when witnesses say a 
20110107034151.000|20110107034153.000|TR0|white Cadillac pulled up next to them at 
20110107034153.000|20110107034155.000|TR0|the intersection of Flamingo and Koval.  
20110107034155.000|20110107034157.000|TR0|Witnesses then say a gunman in the 
20110107034157.000|20110107034159.000|TR0|Cadillac extended his arm out of the 
20110107034159.000|20110107034201.000|TR0|backseat window and fired a semi-automatic

20110107034209.000|20110107034212.000|TR0|Koval, speeding away.  Suge Knight, with 
20110107034212.000|20110107034214.000|TR0|Tupac bleeding in the front seat, made a 
20110107034214.000|20110107034216.000|TR0|u-turn on Flamingo and started driving 
20110107034216.000|20110107034218.000|TR0|back towards the Strip.

20110107034224.000|20110107034226.000|TR0|they followed Suge Knight and Tupac, which 
20110107034226.000|20110107034228.000|TR0|allowed the white Cadillac to get away.

20110107034230.000|20110107034232.000|TR0|(voice-over) There were several possible 
20110107034232.000|20110107034234.000|TR0|motives for the murder. Three hours before 
20110107034234.000|20110107034236.000|TR0|the shooting, this MGM Casino surveillance 
20110107034236.000|20110107034239.000|TR0|video shows Shakur, Suge Knight and their

20110107034241.000|20110107034243.000|TR0|area gang member.  Many believe that 
20110107034243.000|20110107034245.000|TR0|Anderson, seen here after the beating, and 
20110107034245.000|20110107034247.000|TR0|his friends shot Shakur in retaliation.
20110107034247.000|20110107034249.000|TR0|
20110107034249.000|20110107034251.000|TR0|CNN asked Anderson about the accusation.

20110107034310.000|20110107034312.000|TR0|Another theory focused on the gangster 
20110107034312.000|20110107034314.000|TR0|world that Tupac sang about.  Many believe 
20110107034314.000|20110107034316.000|TR0|the murder was part of an East Coast/West 
20110107034316.000|20110107034318.000|TR0|Coast rap war and the dispute between

20110107034353.000|20110107034355.000|TR0|denied any involvement in Tupac's death 
20110107034355.000|20110107034357.000|TR0|and seemed to want to put any rap war to

20110107034426.000|20110107034429.000|TR0|Los Angeles.  Smalls was leaving a music 
20110107034429.000|20110107034431.000|TR0|industry party.  He was shot at a busy 
20110107034431.000|20110107034433.000|TR0|intersection while riding in the passenger

20110107034455.000|20110107034458.000|TR0|the Las Vegas authorities to see if

20110107034506.000|20110107034508.000|TR0|He was stopped just like this vehicle

20110107034512.000|20110107034514.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Former LAPD Detective Russell 
20110107034514.000|20110107034516.000|TR0|Poole was one of those assigned to the 
20110107034516.000|20110107034518.000|TR0|Biggie Smalls case.

20110107034520.000|20110107034522.000|TR0|Witnesses say the gunman looked like this. 
20110107034522.000|20110107034525.000|TR0| He was alone, drove up next to Smalls and 
20110107034525.000|20110107034527.000|TR0|shot him at close range.  Poole is 
20110107034527.000|20110107034529.000|TR0|convinced that Suge Knight ordered Biggie 
20110107034529.000|20110107034531.000|TR0|Smalls' murder, even though Knight was 
20110107034531.000|20110107034533.000|TR0|behind bars at the time.  He also believes 
20110107034533.000|20110107034535.000|TR0|that off-duty LAPD officers who were 
20110107034535.000|20110107034537.000|TR0|working for Knight's Death Row Records 
20110107034537.000|20110107034539.000|TR0|helped plan the murder.

20110107034541.000|20110107034543.000|TR0|RUSSELL POOLE, RETIRED LAPD DETECTIVE:  
20110107034543.000|20110107034545.000|TR0|Suge Knight ordered the hit.  Reggie 
20110107034545.000|20110107034547.000|TR0|Wright Jr., the head of security for 
20110107034547.000|20110107034549.000|TR0|Rightway Security and Death Row, organized 
20110107034549.000|20110107034551.000|TR0|the personnel to plan the hit.  And I 
20110107034551.000|20110107034554.000|TR0|believe police officers were a big part of 
20110107034554.000|20110107034556.000|TR0|the hit.
20110107034556.000|20110107034558.000|TR0|
20110107034558.000|20110107034600.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Poole says he believes Suge 
20110107034600.000|20110107034602.000|TR0|Knight also had Tupac Shakur killed 
20110107034602.000|20110107034604.000|TR0|because the rapper was planning to leave 
20110107034604.000|20110107034606.000|TR0|Knight's Death Row Records.

20110107034608.000|20110107034610.000|TR0|Poole says he retired early from the LAPD 
20110107034610.000|20110107034612.000|TR0|out of frustration because of this case, 
20110107034612.000|20110107034614.000|TR0|saying the department didn't allow him to 
20110107034614.000|20110107034616.000|TR0|pursue leads that involved other cops.
20110107034616.000|20110107034618.000|TR0|
20110107034618.000|20110107034621.000|TR0|POOLE:  I think I was getting too close to 
20110107034621.000|20110107034623.000|TR0|the truth.  I think they feared that the 
20110107034623.000|20110107034625.000|TR0|truth would be a scandal.

20110107034627.000|20110107034629.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Poole later assisted Biggie 
20110107034629.000|20110107034631.000|TR0|Smalls' mother in a lawsuit claiming L.A. 
20110107034631.000|20110107034633.000|TR0|police covered up officers' involvement in

20110107034643.000|20110107034645.000|TR0|accusations are, quote, "absurd," saying, 
20110107034645.000|20110107034648.000|TR0|quote, "We would have never ignored a lead 
20110107034648.000|20110107034650.000|TR0|that could have helped us solve that

20110107034846.000|20110107034848.000|TR0|have not come forward, have not said 
20110107034848.000|20110107034850.000|TR0|anything.

20110107034852.000|20110107034854.000|TR0|JOHN WALSH, HOST, "AMERICA'S MOST WANTED": 
20110107034854.000|20110107034856.000|TR0| You know what bothers me is this B.S. 
20110107034856.000|20110107034858.000|TR0|thing, the stop snitching, where some of 
20110107034858.000|20110107034900.000|TR0|these rappers say, you know, "Don't tell, 
20110107034900.000|20110107034902.000|TR0|don't cooperate with police.  We'll 
20110107034902.000|20110107034904.000|TR0|retaliate."
20110107034904.000|20110107034907.000|TR0|
20110107034907.000|20110107034909.000|TR0|I remember going to Boston and doing a 
20110107034909.000|20110107034911.000|TR0|case where there was a gang banger in 
20110107034911.000|20110107034913.000|TR0|jail, and his defense attorney got the 
20110107034913.000|20110107034915.000|TR0|witness list. And he had one of the 
20110107034915.000|20110107034917.000|TR0|witnesses killed in South Boston from 
20110107034917.000|20110107034919.000|TR0|jail, so they couldn't testify against 
20110107034919.000|20110107034921.000|TR0|him.  Then came the "stop snitching" T- 
20110107034921.000|20110107034923.000|TR0|shirts and all this crap.
20110107034923.000|20110107034925.000|TR0|
20110107034925.000|20110107034927.000|TR0|It could be your neighbor.  It could -- I 
20110107034927.000|20110107034929.000|TR0|don't care where you live.  Yes, if you're 
20110107034929.000|20110107034931.000|TR0|afraid of retaliation, but if you 
20110107034931.000|20110107034933.000|TR0|witnessed a murder or you know something 
20110107034933.000|20110107034936.000|TR0|about it, then do the right thing.  You 
20110107034936.000|20110107034938.000|TR0|can remain anonymous.  You can be 
20110107034938.000|20110107034940.000|TR0|protected.  God forbid it's your brother 
20110107034940.000|20110107034942.000|TR0|that's the next victim or your father or 
20110107034942.000|20110107034944.000|TR0|your cousin or your daughter or your wife.
20110107034944.000|20110107034946.000|TR0|
20110107034946.000|20110107034948.000|TR0|They know exactly.  People know exactly 
20110107034948.000|20110107034950.000|TR0|who killed Biggie.  Tupac was shot right 
20110107034950.000|20110107034952.000|TR0|after Mike Tyson fight on tape.
20110107034952.000|20110107034954.000|TR0|
20110107034954.000|20110107034956.000|TR0|COOPER:  On a busy street in Vegas.
20110107034956.000|20110107034958.000|TR0|
20110107034958.000|20110107035000.000|TR0|WALSH:  I mean, it's a very high-profile 
20110107035000.000|20110107035003.000|TR0|case.
20110107035003.000|20110107035005.000|TR0|
20110107035005.000|20110107035007.000|TR0|COOPER:  Just think, there were people.  I 
20110107035007.000|20110107035009.000|TR0|mean, in Tupac's -- Tupac Shakur's case, 
20110107035009.000|20110107035011.000|TR0|there were people sitting right next to 
20110107035011.000|20110107035013.000|TR0|him. And, you know, in Biggie Smalls' 
20110107035013.000|20110107035015.000|TR0|case, there were people who witnessed this.
20110107035015.000|20110107035017.000|TR0|
20110107035017.000|20110107035019.000|TR0|WALSH:  Yes.
20110107035019.000|20110107035021.000|TR0|
20110107035021.000|20110107035023.000|TR0|COOPER:  And these are people who claimed 
20110107035023.000|20110107035025.000|TR0|to be his friends. They were people who, 
20110107035025.000|20110107035027.000|TR0|you know, made money off him, made money 
20110107035027.000|20110107035030.000|TR0|from him, and yet refused to say anything, 
20110107035030.000|20110107035032.000|TR0|because they're afraid -- maybe they're 
20110107035032.000|20110107035034.000|TR0|afraid for their own life.  But I don't 
20110107035034.000|20110107035036.000|TR0|even give them that much credit.  They're 
20110107035036.000|20110107035038.000|TR0|just afraid of being seen as being a 
20110107035038.000|20110107035040.000|TR0|snitch, which is just absurd.
20110107035040.000|20110107035042.000|TR0|
20110107035042.000|20110107035044.000|TR0|WALSH:  It takes a lot of courage to do 
20110107035044.000|20110107035046.000|TR0|the right thing.  Being a snitch is easy.  
20110107035046.000|20110107035048.000|TR0|Then you're a coward.  Then you're an 
20110107035048.000|20110107035050.000|TR0|accessory to the murder; you're an 
20110107035050.000|20110107035052.000|TR0|accessory to the crime.  You're just a 
20110107035052.000|20110107035054.000|TR0|coward. You're a chicken.
20110107035054.000|20110107035056.000|TR0|
20110107035056.000|20110107035059.000|TR0|But it takes a lot of guts to say, "I know 
20110107035059.000|20110107035101.000|TR0|who did that.  This is the person.  This 
20110107035101.000|20110107035103.000|TR0|is what happened."  You can remain 
20110107035103.000|20110107035105.000|TR0|anonymous.
20110107035105.000|20110107035107.000|TR0|
20110107035107.000|20110107035109.000|TR0|I understand -- I understand the fear.  
20110107035109.000|20110107035111.000|TR0|Yes, there's retaliation. I don't 
20110107035111.000|20110107035113.000|TR0|understand this fake gangster attitude.  
20110107035113.000|20110107035115.000|TR0|You know, I've been on the streets.  Most 
20110107035115.000|20110107035117.000|TR0|of the people in those areas where these 
20110107035117.000|20110107035119.000|TR0|gangsters operate, they're terrified.  
20110107035119.000|20110107035121.000|TR0|They're good people.  They're trapped 
20110107035121.000|20110107035123.000|TR0|there by poverty.  They would do the right 
20110107035123.000|20110107035126.000|TR0|thing.
20110107035126.000|20110107035128.000|TR0|
20110107035128.000|20110107035130.000|TR0|COOPER:  It used to be the definition of a 
20110107035130.000|20110107035132.000|TR0|snitch was somebody who gave -- gave up 
20110107035132.000|20110107035134.000|TR0|information about one of their cohorts in 
20110107035134.000|20110107035136.000|TR0|crime in order to get a lesser sentence.  
20110107035136.000|20110107035138.000|TR0|Now the definition has expanded to anybody 
20110107035138.000|20110107035140.000|TR0|who talks to police.  And that's just -- 
20110107035140.000|20110107035142.000|TR0|that's unacceptable because society cannot 
20110107035142.000|20110107035144.000|TR0|function unless people report what they 
20110107035144.000|20110107035146.000|TR0|see and are good citizens.

20110107035150.000|20110107035153.000|TR0|testimony to good people doing the right 
20110107035153.000|20110107035155.000|TR0|thing.  We've caught 1,200 guys out there. 
20110107035155.000|20110107035157.000|TR0| I believe you save lives.
20110107035157.000|20110107035159.000|TR0|
20110107035159.000|20110107035201.000|TR0|If you know who slit the throat of a 
20110107035201.000|20110107035203.000|TR0|little girl 20 years ago, ten years ago, a 
20110107035203.000|20110107035205.000|TR0|week ago, you could save the life of the 
20110107035205.000|20110107035207.000|TR0|next girl by having the guts to say, "I 
20110107035207.000|20110107035209.000|TR0|think it is my creepy cousin," or "I think 
20110107035209.000|20110107035211.000|TR0|I know who that is."  Think about that.

20110107035213.000|20110107035215.000|TR0|COOPER:  Do you have any insights?  I 
20110107035215.000|20110107035217.000|TR0|mean, you've done Tupac Shakur's killing.  
20110107035217.000|20110107035219.000|TR0|Do you have any insights on who killed 
20110107035219.000|20110107035222.000|TR0|them?  Or why?
20110107035222.000|20110107035224.000|TR0|
20110107035224.000|20110107035226.000|TR0|WALSH:  You know, all this East/West 
20110107035226.000|20110107035228.000|TR0|rivalry between the different hip-hop 
20110107035228.000|20110107035230.000|TR0|factions and the gangster thug stuff, I 
20110107035230.000|20110107035232.000|TR0|really believe that maybe people that were 
20110107035232.000|20110107035234.000|TR0|with Tupac or people that were with Biggie 
20110107035234.000|20110107035236.000|TR0|didn't see who the shooter was, didn't see 
20110107035236.000|20110107035238.000|TR0|who drove by and did the shootings, didn't 
20110107035238.000|20110107035240.000|TR0|see who shot Tupac, but somebody knows. 
20110107035240.000|20110107035242.000|TR0|Somebody helped orchestrate that B.S. 
20110107035242.000|20110107035244.000|TR0|gangster crap, and they've literally 
20110107035244.000|20110107035246.000|TR0|gotten away with murder.
20110107035246.000|20110107035249.000|TR0|
20110107035249.000|20110107035251.000|TR0|I do believe that somebody is going to man 
20110107035251.000|20110107035253.000|TR0|up at some point in their life and say, 
20110107035253.000|20110107035255.000|TR0|"This isn't right."  Biggie had friends, 
20110107035255.000|20110107035257.000|TR0|relatives.  He had a mother, people that 
20110107035257.000|20110107035259.000|TR0|loved him.  Tupac had lots of people.  He 
20110107035259.000|20110107035301.000|TR0|has surviving children.  They need 
20110107035301.000|20110107035303.000|TR0|justice.  And you're just a coward if you 
20110107035303.000|20110107035305.000|TR0|don't man up and say, "I think I know who 
20110107035305.000|20110107035307.000|TR0|did it. This is who it is.  This is what 
20110107035307.000|20110107035309.000|TR0|happened.  I don't want to leave my name.  
20110107035309.000|20110107035311.000|TR0|Get you back on track.  You can break this

20110107035322.000|20110107035324.000|TR0|the most notorious cold cases, revisiting 
20110107035324.000|20110107035326.000|TR0|the JonBenet Ramsey case, the murder of a

20110107035328.000|20110107035330.000|TR0| Took over the headlines.  Even though the 
20110107035330.000|20110107035332.000|TR0|case is cold, the story is not.  Just a 
20110107035332.000|20110107035334.000|TR0|few months ago, there were new reports 
20110107035334.000|20110107035336.000|TR0|about police contacting JonBenet's older 
20110107035336.000|20110107035338.000|TR0|brother.  We're reopening the cold case on

20110107035409.000|20110107035412.000|TR0|COOPER:  "The RidicuList" coming up, but 
20110107035412.000|20110107035414.000|TR0|first let's check in with Joe Johns for 
20110107035414.000|20110107035416.000|TR0|the "360 News  &  Business Bulletin" --

20110107035420.000|20110107035422.000|TR0|JOHNS:  Anderson, more than 1,000 U.S. 
20110107035422.000|20110107035424.000|TR0|Marines will soon be heading to 
20110107035424.000|20110107035426.000|TR0|Afghanistan.  They'll help with security 
20110107035426.000|20110107035428.000|TR0|efforts in the southern part of the 
20110107035428.000|20110107035430.000|TR0|country.  A U.S. military official says 
20110107035430.000|20110107035432.000|TR0|they'll be on the ground for only a few 
20110107035432.000|20110107035434.000|TR0|months.

20110107035436.000|20110107035438.000|TR0|In Maryland, about 2 million fish were 
20110107035438.000|20110107035441.000|TR0|found dead in the Chesapeake Bay.  State 
20110107035441.000|20110107035443.000|TR0|environmental officials say the water 
20110107035443.000|20110107035445.000|TR0|likely got too cold.  This fish kill comes 
20110107035445.000|20110107035447.000|TR0|just days after 100,000 fish died in 
20110107035447.000|20110107035449.000|TR0|northwest Arkansas.  Authorities suspect 
20110107035449.000|20110107035451.000|TR0|disease was to blame there.

20110107035453.000|20110107035455.000|TR0|Holiday sales chilled last month after a 
20110107035455.000|20110107035457.000|TR0|surge in November. Target posted a gain of 
20110107035457.000|20110107035459.000|TR0|just .9 percent.  That's way off the 
20110107035459.000|20110107035501.000|TR0|estimated gain of 4 percent.  Gap, Wet 
20110107035501.000|20110107035503.000|TR0|Seal and others also had weak sales.  The 
20110107035503.000|20110107035505.000|TR0|declines are linked to deep discounting 
20110107035505.000|20110107035508.000|TR0|and surging online sales.

20110107035553.000|20110107035555.000|TR0|a credit card.  That's incredible.

20110107035601.000|20110107035604.000|TR0|Time for "The RidicuList."  We should put

20110107035606.000|20110107035608.000|TR0|Tonight, the honor goes to someone we're 
20110107035608.000|20110107035610.000|TR0|calling simply the interrupter, which by 
20110107035610.000|20110107035612.000|TR0|the way, would be a great title for a

20110107035618.000|20110107035620.000|TR0|So did you hear about this?  This morning, 
20110107035620.000|20110107035622.000|TR0|members of the House of Representatives 
20110107035622.000|20110107035624.000|TR0|took turns reading the U.S. Constitution. 
20110107035624.000|20110107035626.000|TR0|Everything was going OK, even if it wasn't 
20110107035626.000|20110107035628.000|TR0|the most riveting event ever broadcast.
20110107035628.000|20110107035631.000|TR0|
20110107035631.000|20110107035633.000|TR0|Then something happened during the reading 
20110107035633.000|20110107035635.000|TR0|of Article 2, section one, the part that 
20110107035635.000|20110107035637.000|TR0|says who is eligible to become president.

20110107035712.000|20110107035714.000|TR0|that any manifestation of approval or

20110107035727.000|20110107035729.000|TR0|gallery.  An apparent birther started 
20110107035729.000|20110107035731.000|TR0|shouting, and then the gavel came down to

20110107035739.000|20110107035741.000|TR0|was not born in Hawaii.  He was.  The 
20110107035741.000|20110107035743.000|TR0|evidence proves it.  I know, I know.  It 
20110107035743.000|20110107035745.000|TR0|isn't like congressmen themselves have set

20110107035908.000|20110107035910.000|TR0|concert. Yes, sure, you might get a few

20110107035917.000|20110107035919.000|TR0|disturbing the order of the House, and
