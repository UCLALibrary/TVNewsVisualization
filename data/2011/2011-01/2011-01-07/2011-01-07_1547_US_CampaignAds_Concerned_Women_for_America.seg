when john bainer gives back the plane when they eliminate earmarks well and they talk about go back to two thousand eight spending levels when they've read the constitution all bills must be you know applicable using fish they are showing the tea party exactly with the tea party once again i think is a responsible but i've told them i met with about five different committee chairman and

for women with sixty four percent more omega bill this is mrs really about u_k_ tea party was about jackson both parties both parties have sought dollars yet but it was all of the hell we have the whole of the reaction of obama come down on the job of solomon the republican party under bush did all the spending there was no surprise there ten twelve initials certified pointedly trillion under police didn't get sick i'm not saying that that's not true are saying that was true a fourth parties it was actually through the bush get into and the team on the part of the methods they worked yeah has had a very good at it and that's a big daddy that's a lesson as the bush deficit got the last year with the republican congress we'll bomb a court reporter will have a lot about parties have gotten the message and sixty-three didn't crash followed by lamar hospital after the recital action are going to give her father break for the great great great britain comes straight ahead and appreciate what's improper d a_c_l_u_ pennsylvanians have been ticketed for cursing at an overflowing toilets or being motorcyclist park it issued for ticket issuer by the way they deserve to be such that they tried not parking tickets we can put your quarter in the machine now you understand that you don't really deserved it up but what we think free speech when you know you're totally smeal let me know if i don't know if it for that matter before and i i i i wait a minute might've been part of a government idealist whatever that may be stupid but i understand what with swallowing as their comeuppance i stopped no civility is important in public discourse everybody i mean we've are going back to george washington and intense depending one standard for motorcyclists homemade might not by computer and in your car so i have been the face of a cop i'm not sure point as want up with the a_c_l_u_ let me get this straight empowered to use gods name as long as you can expletive at the end of it but you can't use gods name sincerely and wherever i only can it be okay with them that is that interesting point repeat your response you don't have one i don't have a response that agis that they would have to go to david outlining look i think freedom religion freedom of speech these are the visa never the only thing i disagree is still use medicare happens makes a living off of since then and school n and small communities in knoxville tennessee because the public wants in some way talk about their faith can imagine tried this thin veneer respectability they see on a senior well is ever uni inures a smooth protects people's rights to you know what their toilet is it's ok payments are going to go on to well will with first will be administration has lost ill they retire aka team uh... really missing robert gives her a california depressing to me william daly is going to be a part of the new white house chief of staff uh... is guy connections to for fannie mae herman is one of the many in the administration a good choice bad choice jim but your goal william daly was the one the first democrat who warned the obama administration to removing too far to the left has to be restore crumbles master an op ed and the washington post he was right let's get this straight obama has had extended all of the bush tax cuts including on the upper income earners he's gotten rid of uh... a lot of liberals anna's office and he's hired william daley who was the leading voice for moderation is also the brother of the mayor of chicago course startle bombs political career sounds to me is a pub on has implicitly abandoned much there was none of these last two years he's falling back into chicago machine group so when the dependent push the radical start really don't ask don't tell that push the dream act initially where there's been a significant shift in his opinion will be given a choice about about the tax agreement going into the well who i think he recognizes he doesn't have any charge so i think he's moving to symbolic issues to placate the left run economics i think you're going to see a lot of regulation still push through but the cosmetics the atmospherics administration reformer moderate and william daley what tougher for the right to calm socialist syndrome theoretically o done we are talking about and it's a corporate that yeah it's it's what corporate socialism adjustments in the back around to the election and being able to raise money from operation donors peasant let's not forget that what how many months again at that the actual commerce is quite axis of evil it was accused of are we have a legal almost daily now then embraced at play he's basically a message for the democratic donors we're not going to be so far left the minister of the wall street people give us the money leaving behind a repair on with bill daley senator difference there and it's a very very very grim business together living straddle bottle well i think i think that i think that was one of the first mistakes obama made coming and i thought so that from the beginning i don't think this is vasily good move for me either although actually i think from a lack of point it's a great move for me is moving in the right but i don't have a lot of a lot of right arise as well and i think it's going to be a last night on the issues like the debt ceiling he has no choice congress controls the purse strings and behavior that this new congress if they it here to the promises they made they are going to demand spending-cut significant ones and the now defunct significant portions of health care filed that you can stop it but that he gets begins by that begins the but it's not done yet it's not his principles on as i told you to know if they can you're right here without getting reelected ribbon reelection right when i realized that i know that you've got a little if i could have been a laugh reluctantly but he will move in that direction spending less work well i think he is gone and there is someone that i think of the bot and bottom obama is an ideologue and his allies and they're so far like especially was good to see all of the and that is all tell me about this evening as always thank you for being with us let not your heartbeat troubled and news continues greta's next
