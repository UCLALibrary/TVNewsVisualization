20110107071844.000|20110107071846.000|CC1|THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME, THE

20110107071851.000|20110107071852.000|CC1|STARTED TO DEVELOP.             
20110107071852.000|20110107071854.000|CC1|I SAID I COULD USE TENNIS AS A

20110107071906.000|20110107071907.000|CC1|I STARTED TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

20110107071909.000|20110107071910.000|CC1|SPORT AND STARTED TO BECOME AT  
20110107071910.000|20110107071912.000|CC1|PEACE WITH IT, AND THE SPORT

20110107071957.000|20110107072000.000|CC1|>> I THINK IT STRENGTHENS A LOT,
20110107072000.000|20110107072001.000|CC1|THOSE WHO READ IT.

20110107072005.000|20110107072009.000|CC1|-- THERE ARE TWO BUCKETS PEOPLE 
20110107072009.000|20110107072011.000|CC1|FIT IN, THOSE WHO RESPONDED AND 
20110107072011.000|20110107072013.000|CC1|THOSE WHO REACTED.

20110107072018.000|20110107072020.000|CC1|I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH MYSELF

20110107072021.000|20110107072023.000|CC1|BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT BROADENED 
20110107072023.000|20110107072030.000|CC1|TO -- I THINK IT BROADENED THE  
20110107072030.000|20110107072031.000|CC1|SPORT AND IT STIMULATES THE     
20110107072031.000|20110107072033.000|CC1|DIALOGUE WITH PARENTS AND KIDS  
20110107072033.000|20110107072033.000|CC1|AND SPORTS.
