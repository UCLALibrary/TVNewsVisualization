20110108020043.000|20110108020046.000|TR0|year's earthquake.  For 65 hours, he 
20110108020046.000|20110108020048.000|TR0|battled, bleeding, shock and despair, even 
20110108020048.000|20110108020050.000|TR0|drinking his own urine to survive until 
20110108020050.000|20110108020053.000|TR0|help finally arrived.

20110108020102.000|20110108020104.000|TR0|Afghanistan, held for more than seven 
20110108020104.000|20110108020106.000|TR0|months.  You're going to hear his

20110108020127.000|20110108020129.000|TR0|But, we begin with the man, the legend, 
20110108020129.000|20110108020132.000|TR0|Bear Grylls.  At 23, he became the 
20110108020132.000|20110108020134.000|TR0|youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest.  
20110108020134.000|20110108020136.000|TR0|He's also circumnavigated the U.K. on a 
20110108020136.000|20110108020139.000|TR0|jet ski, crossed the North Atlantic in an 
20110108020139.000|20110108020141.000|TR0|inflatable boat and paramotored over 
20110108020141.000|20110108020143.000|TR0|Venezuela's Angel Falls.  Now, he's host 
20110108020143.000|20110108020146.000|TR0|of the Discovery Channel's "Man Versus

20110108020155.000|20110108020157.000|TR0|his wits to survive.
20110108020157.000|20110108020159.000|TR0|
20110108020159.000|20110108020202.000|TR0|Take a look.

20110108020209.000|20110108020211.000|TR0|BEAR GRYLLS, "MAN VERSUS WILD":  I'm Bear 
20110108020211.000|20110108020213.000|TR0|Grylls.
20110108020213.000|20110108020216.000|TR0|
20110108020216.000|20110108020218.000|TR0|I've traveled to the most dangerous parts 
20110108020218.000|20110108020220.000|TR0|of the planet, especially the most extreme 
20110108020220.000|20110108020222.000|TR0|challenges, all to show you how to 
20110108020222.000|20110108020225.000|TR0|survive, of being to the edge, but now I'm 
20110108020225.000|20110108020227.000|TR0|back.
20110108020227.000|20110108020229.000|TR0|
20110108020229.000|20110108020232.000|TR0|OK.  Let's go.
20110108020232.000|20110108020234.000|TR0|
20110108020234.000|20110108020236.000|TR0|I'm taking on the toughest tests that 
20110108020236.000|20110108020239.000|TR0|nature has to offer and pushed my mind and 
20110108020239.000|20110108020241.000|TR0|body to the absolute limit.
20110108020241.000|20110108020243.000|TR0|

20110108020248.000|20110108020250.000|TR0|COOPER:  It gets my heart pumping just 
20110108020250.000|20110108020252.000|TR0|watching it.  Bear Grylls joins me now 
20110108020252.000|20110108020255.000|TR0|from London.  How did you get started 
20110108020255.000|20110108020257.000|TR0|doing this?
20110108020257.000|20110108020259.000|TR0|
20110108020259.000|20110108020302.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  I always kind of feel I've done 
20110108020302.000|20110108020304.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) when I was about 6 years old 
20110108020304.000|20110108020306.000|TR0|but never filmed before, you know?  But my 
20110108020306.000|20110108020309.000|TR0|dad taught me to climb when I was very 
20110108020309.000|20110108020311.000|TR0|small, and probably 5 or 6.  And then I 
20110108020311.000|20110108020313.000|TR0|grew up, and I joined the army.  Spent 
20110108020313.000|20110108020315.000|TR0|three years with the British Special 
20110108020315.000|20110108020318.000|TR0|Forces and the job there is solely combat 
20110108020318.000|20110108020320.000|TR0|survival and the sky diving and the 
20110108020320.000|20110108020322.000|TR0|climbing and really -- so I kind of feel 
20110108020322.000|20110108020325.000|TR0|it's what I've always done all my life, 
20110108020325.000|20110108020327.000|TR0|it's just -- you know, it's what I love.  
20110108020327.000|20110108020329.000|TR0|To be honest, it's about the only thing 
20110108020329.000|20110108020332.000|TR0|I'm good at, as well.
20110108020332.000|20110108020334.000|TR0|
20110108020334.000|20110108020336.000|TR0|COOPER:  You broke your back in the 
20110108020336.000|20110108020339.000|TR0|Special Air Services, Special Forces.  Is 
20110108020339.000|20110108020341.000|TR0|that right?
20110108020341.000|20110108020343.000|TR0|
20110108020343.000|20110108020345.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  I did.  I had a free fall 
20110108020345.000|20110108020348.000|TR0|accident in southern Africa where I broke 
20110108020348.000|20110108020350.000|TR0|my back in three places and spent a year 
20110108020350.000|20110108020352.000|TR0|in rehabilitation strapped up in, you 
20110108020352.000|20110108020355.000|TR0|know, braces and all of that bad stuff and 
20110108020355.000|20110108020357.000|TR0|had to leave the army.  And that for me 
20110108020357.000|20110108020359.000|TR0|was kind of the dark time trying to 
20110108020359.000|20110108020402.000|TR0|refine, you know, your movement.  But 
20110108020402.000|20110108020404.000|TR0|also, you know, my confidence. And it took 
20110108020404.000|20110108020406.000|TR0|me a long time to rebuild that.
20110108020406.000|20110108020409.000|TR0|
20110108020409.000|20110108020411.000|TR0|But what I found when I started to recover 
20110108020411.000|20110108020413.000|TR0|is to climb again.  And for me, Everest 
20110108020413.000|20110108020415.000|TR0|had been a huge dream of mine since I was 
20110108020415.000|20110108020418.000|TR0|a kid climbing with my dad.
20110108020418.000|20110108020420.000|TR0|
20110108020420.000|20110108020422.000|TR0|And Everest then became the focus of the 
20110108020422.000|20110108020425.000|TR0|recovery and, you know, we eventually took 
20110108020425.000|20110108020427.000|TR0|a team of four climbers, soldier climbers, 
20110108020427.000|20110108020429.000|TR0|to the mountain and, you know, a lot went 
20110108020429.000|20110108020432.000|TR0|wrong up there.  You know, we had four 
20110108020432.000|20110108020434.000|TR0|guys killed, as well, on the mountain.  
20110108020434.000|20110108020436.000|TR0|And, you know, I think it shakes -- shakes 
20110108020436.000|20110108020438.000|TR0|your faith that everything's always going 
20110108020438.000|20110108020441.000|TR0|to be all right.
20110108020441.000|20110108020443.000|TR0|
20110108020443.000|20110108020445.000|TR0|COOPER:  Have you been on a trip for "Man 
20110108020445.000|20110108020448.000|TR0|Versus Wild" and doubted yourself or your 
20110108020448.000|20110108020450.000|TR0|abilities?
20110108020450.000|20110108020452.000|TR0|
20110108020452.000|20110108020455.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Yes.  I think I wouldn't be human 
20110108020455.000|20110108020457.000|TR0|if I didn't have kind of those moments of 
20110108020457.000|20110108020459.000|TR0|doubt and again, the honest thing is that 
20110108020459.000|20110108020502.000|TR0|every day when we're filming at times when 
20110108020502.000|20110108020504.000|TR0|I'm cold and scared and, you know, 
20110108020504.000|20110108020506.000|TR0|thinking what the hell -- you know, what 
20110108020506.000|20110108020508.000|TR0|the hell am I doing in this place?  Those 
20110108020508.000|20110108020511.000|TR0|are normal emotions when you're up against 
20110108020511.000|20110108020513.000|TR0|it in life and I think -- you know, I 
20110108020513.000|20110108020515.000|TR0|think a big part of survival is 
20110108020515.000|20110108020518.000|TR0|acknowledging those and but then trying to 
20110108020518.000|20110108020520.000|TR0|smile through them and come out the other 
20110108020520.000|20110108020522.000|TR0|side.  And the heart of survival is that 
20110108020522.000|20110108020525.000|TR0|never quitting. You know, that's really, 
20110108020525.000|20110108020527.000|TR0|you know, the meat of it.
20110108020527.000|20110108020529.000|TR0|
20110108020529.000|20110108020531.000|TR0|COOPER:  What would you say are if keys to 
20110108020531.000|20110108020534.000|TR0|surviving in a dangerous situation or in a 
20110108020534.000|20110108020536.000|TR0|bad situation?
20110108020536.000|20110108020538.000|TR0|
20110108020538.000|20110108020541.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  I think the whole thing of being 
20110108020541.000|20110108020543.000|TR0|cheerful in adversity is a huge one.  You 
20110108020543.000|20110108020545.000|TR0|know, being able to smile when it's really 
20110108020545.000|20110108020548.000|TR0|raining and, you know, when the time is 
20110108020548.000|20110108020550.000|TR0|really tough.  And I think that and a 
20110108020550.000|20110108020552.000|TR0|combination of never giving up is actually 
20110108020552.000|20110108020555.000|TR0|-- you know, that is survival.  And, you 
20110108020555.000|20110108020557.000|TR0|know, I love that Winston Churchill quote 
20110108020557.000|20110108020559.000|TR0|of just says never, ever, ever give up.  
20110108020559.000|20110108020601.000|TR0|And when you're going through hell, keep 
20110108020601.000|20110108020604.000|TR0|going.  That really is survival in a 
20110108020604.000|20110108020606.000|TR0|nutshell.
20110108020606.000|20110108020608.000|TR0|
20110108020608.000|20110108020611.000|TR0|COOPER:  You have a list of top 10 
20110108020611.000|20110108020613.000|TR0|household items to save your life in the 
20110108020613.000|20110108020615.000|TR0|wild.  I just want to read the top five 
20110108020615.000|20110108020618.000|TR0|and have you tell me how each one can save 
20110108020618.000|20110108020620.000|TR0|you.  Number five is a shoe lace.  What do 
20110108020620.000|20110108020622.000|TR0|you do with that?
20110108020622.000|20110108020624.000|TR0|
20110108020624.000|20110108020627.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Well, there's so much to do with 
20110108020627.000|20110108020629.000|TR0|a shoe lace -- making traps, to climbing 
20110108020629.000|20110108020631.000|TR0|up trees, to stitching stuff, to securing 
20110108020631.000|20110108020634.000|TR0|yourself to something.  So, you know, what 
20110108020634.000|20110108020636.000|TR0|I love about survival is the fact that 
20110108020636.000|20110108020638.000|TR0|it's not just all about the text but 
20110108020638.000|20110108020641.000|TR0|knowledge.  It's about improvising, you 
20110108020641.000|20110108020643.000|TR0|know, when you're up against it.  And, you 
20110108020643.000|20110108020645.000|TR0|know, thousand different ways you can use 
20110108020645.000|20110108020648.000|TR0|stuff.
20110108020648.000|20110108020650.000|TR0|
20110108020650.000|20110108020652.000|TR0|And I think the one edge over the animals 
20110108020652.000|20110108020654.000|TR0|is this ability to really improvise and 
20110108020654.000|20110108020657.000|TR0|really adapt.  And, you know, that's a 
20110108020657.000|20110108020659.000|TR0|part of survival I love.  I love getting 
20110108020659.000|20110108020701.000|TR0|dropped on these places with very little 
20110108020701.000|20110108020704.000|TR0|and showing how you can use just a couple 
20110108020704.000|20110108020706.000|TR0|of simple things to achieve something that 
20110108020706.000|20110108020708.000|TR0|you'd never come to think possible, 
20110108020708.000|20110108020711.000|TR0|whether sitting up a tree (ph) using shoe 
20110108020711.000|20110108020713.000|TR0|laces, or, you know, making a raft out of 
20110108020713.000|20110108020715.000|TR0|kind of almost nothing.  And, you know, 
20110108020715.000|20110108020717.000|TR0|that's a part of it I love.
20110108020717.000|20110108020720.000|TR0|
20110108020720.000|20110108020722.000|TR0|COOPER:  Number four is a sock.  What 
20110108020722.000|20110108020724.000|TR0|would you use a sock for?
20110108020724.000|20110108020727.000|TR0|
20110108020727.000|20110108020729.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  A sock?  Again, loads of things.  
20110108020729.000|20110108020731.000|TR0|You know, you can filter water through it. 
20110108020731.000|20110108020734.000|TR0| I've filtered so much water myself and 
20110108020734.000|20110108020736.000|TR0|even my underpants over years, you know, 
20110108020736.000|20110108020738.000|TR0|and got stuffed it with grass and charcoal 
20110108020738.000|20110108020741.000|TR0|and sand and gravel and filtered water 
20110108020741.000|20110108020743.000|TR0|through it.  It's never going to going to 
20110108020743.000|20110108020745.000|TR0|taste very nice or look very pretty.  But, 
20110108020745.000|20110108020747.000|TR0|again, you know, the heart of "Man Versus 
20110108020747.000|20110108020750.000|TR0|Wild" is that this might not look pretty 
20110108020750.000|20110108020752.000|TR0|but it could save your life.
20110108020752.000|20110108020754.000|TR0|
20110108020754.000|20110108020757.000|TR0|COOPER:  Number three is a wristwatch.  
20110108020757.000|20110108020759.000|TR0|What is that, for direction as a compass?
20110108020759.000|20110108020801.000|TR0|
20110108020801.000|20110108020804.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  You know, wristwatch, it's just 
20110108020804.000|20110108020806.000|TR0|good.  You know, number one thing is to 
20110108020806.000|20110108020808.000|TR0|you're going to get your bearings if 
20110108020808.000|20110108020811.000|TR0|you're going to get yourself out of there. 
20110108020811.000|20110108020813.000|TR0| You need to know which way you're doing.  
20110108020813.000|20110108020815.000|TR0|And, you know, most people don't carry 
20110108020815.000|20110108020817.000|TR0|compass with them.  There's a simple way 
20110108020817.000|20110108020820.000|TR0|of using wristwatch and pointing the hour 
20110108020820.000|20110108020822.000|TR0|hand of sun (INAUDIBLE) 12:00 to give you 
20110108020822.000|20110108020824.000|TR0|a south line and, you know, you have 
20110108020824.000|20110108020827.000|TR0|worked out the directions.
20110108020827.000|20110108020829.000|TR0|
20110108020829.000|20110108020831.000|TR0|So, it's a simple thing.  But, you know, 
20110108020831.000|20110108020834.000|TR0|again, it's something all of us carry that 
20110108020834.000|20110108020836.000|TR0|might not necessarily know that there's 
20110108020836.000|20110108020838.000|TR0|more ways of using your wristwatch.
20110108020838.000|20110108020840.000|TR0|
20110108020840.000|20110108020843.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, wait a minute, I didn't 
20110108020843.000|20110108020845.000|TR0|actually know that.  If you point the 
20110108020845.000|20110108020847.000|TR0|12:00 to the sun and what is it?
20110108020847.000|20110108020850.000|TR0|
20110108020850.000|20110108020852.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Yes.  So in the Northern 
20110108020852.000|20110108020854.000|TR0|Hemisphere, 12:00 at the sun, split the 
20110108020854.000|20110108020857.000|TR0|line between your hour hand and the 12:00 
20110108020857.000|20110108020859.000|TR0|and that will give you a southerly 
20110108020859.000|20110108020901.000|TR0|direction.
20110108020901.000|20110108020904.000|TR0|
20110108020904.000|20110108020906.000|TR0|COOPER:  So, that's the direction of 
20110108020906.000|20110108020908.000|TR0|south.  Oh, that's interesting. OK.  
20110108020908.000|20110108020910.000|TR0|Number two on the list was a paper clip.
20110108020910.000|20110108020913.000|TR0|
20110108020913.000|20110108020915.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Anderson, you should know that.  
20110108020915.000|20110108020917.000|TR0|Even my kids know that one.
20110108020917.000|20110108020920.000|TR0|
20110108020920.000|20110108020922.000|TR0|COOPER:  What?  It's a compass or it's 
20110108020922.000|20110108020924.000|TR0|magnetized?  Is that right?
20110108020924.000|20110108020927.000|TR0|
20110108020927.000|20110108020929.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  A paper clip.  Yes.  Again, so 
20110108020929.000|20110108020931.000|TR0|many things -- you can thread with it.  
20110108020931.000|20110108020933.000|TR0|You can use it as triggers for traps.  
20110108020933.000|20110108020936.000|TR0|Again, you could use it for a compass.  
20110108020936.000|20110108020938.000|TR0|You magnetize it on and put it a leaf and 
20110108020938.000|20110108020940.000|TR0|some water and it will show you a magnetic 
20110108020940.000|20110108020943.000|TR0|north direction.
20110108020943.000|20110108020945.000|TR0|
20110108020945.000|20110108020947.000|TR0|So, again, it's about taking every day 
20110108020947.000|20110108020950.000|TR0|items and thinking a bit left field and, 
20110108020950.000|20110108020952.000|TR0|you know, they always say necessity is the 
20110108020952.000|20110108020954.000|TR0|mother of invention and that is survival 
20110108020954.000|20110108020957.000|TR0|to kind of think all I've got is a paper 
20110108020957.000|20110108020959.000|TR0|clip.  I got to work out a direction, 
20110108020959.000|20110108021001.000|TR0|you'd eventually come out with a way of 
20110108021001.000|20110108021003.000|TR0|finding it.
20110108021003.000|20110108021006.000|TR0|
20110108021006.000|20110108021008.000|TR0|COOPER:  And final thing was a battery.  
20110108021008.000|20110108021010.000|TR0|Is that for what, starting a fire or 
20110108021010.000|20110108021013.000|TR0|something?
20110108021013.000|20110108021015.000|TR0|
20110108021015.000|20110108021017.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Yes.  Again, you know, battery -- 
20110108021017.000|20110108021020.000|TR0|so many things, again, that, you know, you 
20110108021020.000|20110108021022.000|TR0|might be, you know, you need a signal out. 
20110108021022.000|20110108021024.000|TR0| You can use a radio, a cell phone, and 
20110108021024.000|20110108021026.000|TR0|rig it up to work again.  You can use it 
20110108021026.000|20110108021029.000|TR0|for fire and I've started loads of fires 
20110108021029.000|20110108021031.000|TR0|over the years with car batteries just to 
20110108021031.000|20110108021033.000|TR0|get a bit of tinder going.  So, yes, 
20110108021033.000|20110108021036.000|TR0|useful thing.
20110108021036.000|20110108021038.000|TR0|

20110108021056.000|20110108021059.000|TR0|is that actually drink the fluid from a 
20110108021059.000|20110108021101.000|TR0|fresh elephant dung.  Not one of the 
20110108021101.000|20110108021103.000|TR0|better drinks I've had.  I'm not going to

20110108021110.000|20110108021113.000|TR0|It's actually ranks as one of the worst

20110108021145.000|20110108021147.000|TR0| But, you know, if you're going to get out 
20110108021147.000|20110108021149.000|TR0|somewhere, you need to energy and if 
20110108021149.000|20110108021152.000|TR0|you're going to get energy, you got to eat.
20110108021152.000|20110108021154.000|TR0|
20110108021154.000|20110108021156.000|TR0|So, you do need to kind of leave your 
20110108021156.000|20110108021159.000|TR0|prejudices behind and definitely find, and 
20110108021159.000|20110108021201.000|TR0|get that zone a little bit, once I'm out 
20110108021201.000|20110108021203.000|TR0|of that helicopter or plane and you kind 
20110108021203.000|20110108021206.000|TR0|of get on to do it.  But that was -- that 
20110108021206.000|20110108021208.000|TR0|was particularly.  It was a huge grub.  
20110108021208.000|20110108021210.000|TR0|And I shall remember filming this and I 
20110108021210.000|20110108021213.000|TR0|show you often in the dead bark of trees, 
20110108021213.000|20110108021215.000|TR0|you got these grubs feeding off the wood.
20110108021215.000|20110108021217.000|TR0|
20110108021217.000|20110108021219.000|TR0|And I found this one.  It was kind of big 
20110108021219.000|20110108021222.000|TR0|and I thought, it wasn't big and I ate it. 
20110108021222.000|20110108021224.000|TR0| And I was walking up, I just lift on the 
20110108021224.000|20110108021226.000|TR0|side a little bit.  I lift it up and I saw 
20110108021226.000|20110108021229.000|TR0|this guy's mother in there.
20110108021229.000|20110108021231.000|TR0|
20110108021231.000|20110108021233.000|TR0|And I kind of have one of those light 
20110108021233.000|20110108021236.000|TR0|moments of Jesus lived this, I've done 
20110108021236.000|20110108021238.000|TR0|this, we're moving on that to get going 
20110108021238.000|20110108021240.000|TR0|or, no, we got to this.  And it was, yes, 
20110108021240.000|20110108021242.000|TR0|you know, that survival for you.

20110108021303.000|20110108021306.000|TR0| When you begin to eat it.

20110108021308.000|20110108021310.000|TR0|Inside it.  Pull it over.  And I'll be 100

20110108021317.000|20110108021319.000|TR0|and pee is not high on my list.

20110108021322.000|20110108021324.000|TR0|And the only way they manage to stay 
20110108021324.000|20110108021326.000|TR0|hydrated is by using that fetid water and 
20110108021326.000|20110108021329.000|TR0|giving themselves an enema and then once 
20110108021329.000|20110108021331.000|TR0|it's in -- ugh.  I guess all you can do is 
20110108021331.000|20110108021333.000|TR0|lie back and think of England!

20110108021335.000|20110108021338.000|TR0|A gentle reminder that survival is rarely

20110108021349.000|20110108021352.000|TR0|is there ever something where you're like, 
20110108021352.000|20110108021354.000|TR0|you know what?  I'm not going to do this.  
20110108021354.000|20110108021356.000|TR0|I mean --

20110108021359.000|20110108021401.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Well, you know, that was a great 
20110108021401.000|20110108021403.000|TR0|story of a British family whose -- their 
20110108021403.000|20110108021405.000|TR0|ship got hauled by a whale and ended up in 
20110108021405.000|20110108021408.000|TR0|the life raft for about 35 days and then 
20110108021408.000|20110108021410.000|TR0|ran out of water, ran out of food, and 
20110108021410.000|20110108021412.000|TR0|they lived off turtle and turtle blood and 
20110108021412.000|20110108021415.000|TR0|all the blood and water and it gathered in 
20110108021415.000|20110108021417.000|TR0|the bottom in the life raft, that it, you 
20110108021417.000|20110108021419.000|TR0|know, gone off and as they drank it, 
20110108021419.000|20110108021422.000|TR0|making them sick and more dehydrated.  And 
20110108021422.000|20110108021424.000|TR0|the mother was a nurse and she knew she 
20110108021424.000|20110108021426.000|TR0|could get, you know, this fetid water into 
20110108021426.000|20110108021428.000|TR0|their kids plural enema, it would hydrate 
20110108021428.000|20110108021431.000|TR0|them and but it wouldn't make them sick 
20110108021431.000|20110108021433.000|TR0|and actually saved their lives.
20110108021433.000|20110108021435.000|TR0|
20110108021435.000|20110108021438.000|TR0|So, I kind of knew this story.  I thought 
20110108021438.000|20110108021440.000|TR0|it would be great to try to show it, but, 
20110108021440.000|20110108021442.000|TR0|you know, again, it comes amongst those 
20110108021442.000|20110108021445.000|TR0|moments and not a lot of fun.  I have 
20110108021445.000|20110108021447.000|TR0|learned over the years of what viewers 
20110108021447.000|20110108021449.000|TR0|like is not what I like.  They like it 
20110108021449.000|20110108021452.000|TR0|when it's a terrible food and hanging off 
20110108021452.000|20110108021454.000|TR0|a rock face by a finger and doing yourself 
20110108021454.000|20110108021456.000|TR0|enemas.
20110108021456.000|20110108021458.000|TR0|
20110108021458.000|20110108021501.000|TR0|I like it when it's nice, classic, gentle 
20110108021501.000|20110108021503.000|TR0|environment with no snakes and crocodiles. 
20110108021503.000|20110108021505.000|TR0| But we don't get many of those sadly.

20110108021512.000|20110108021515.000|TR0|the TV show, you have three kids and your 
20110108021515.000|20110108021517.000|TR0|wife said to you like, did you really have 
20110108021517.000|20110108021519.000|TR0|to do that?
20110108021519.000|20110108021521.000|TR0|
20110108021521.000|20110108021524.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Well, I work on the principle of 
20110108021524.000|20110108021526.000|TR0|not telling them so much. You know?  I've 
20110108021526.000|20110108021528.000|TR0|learned that over the years.  Otherwise, 
20110108021528.000|20110108021531.000|TR0|I'll never get kissed at home.  So, you 
20110108021531.000|20110108021533.000|TR0|know, I kind of get back and just dump the 
20110108021533.000|20110108021535.000|TR0|bags and back into life.  In occasion, she 
20110108021535.000|20110108021538.000|TR0|glimpses at the stuff and she says, you 
20110108021538.000|20110108021540.000|TR0|got be joking.  But we try to skirt over 
20110108021540.000|20110108021542.000|TR0|those, but it's funny.
20110108021542.000|20110108021545.000|TR0|
20110108021545.000|20110108021547.000|TR0|My kids, never used to let them watch.  I 
20110108021547.000|20110108021549.000|TR0|didn't want them thinking dad had this 
20110108021549.000|20110108021551.000|TR0|weird job, you know, and then suddenly all 
20110108021551.000|20110108021554.000|TR0|their friends at school wanted the chat 
20110108021554.000|20110108021556.000|TR0|about it and I felt a bit nasty.  So, then 
20110108021556.000|20110108021558.000|TR0|I let them watch it and now they love it 
20110108021558.000|20110108021601.000|TR0|and now, they're off it now. They're into 
20110108021601.000|20110108021603.000|TR0|"MythBusters."  Dad is now history.

20110108021608.000|20110108021610.000|TR0|to keep them interested.  We showed you a 
20110108021610.000|20110108021612.000|TR0|clip basically without clothes in freezing 
20110108021612.000|20110108021615.000|TR0|cold water and I remember actually seeing 
20110108021615.000|20110108021617.000|TR0|that episode and it surprised me because 
20110108021617.000|20110108021619.000|TR0|you get out of the water and I would have 
20110108021619.000|20110108021621.000|TR0|thought you would have wanted to 
20110108021621.000|20110108021624.000|TR0|immediately get dressed.  But you actually 
20110108021624.000|20110108021626.000|TR0|rolled in the snow first because that 
20110108021626.000|20110108021628.000|TR0|actually takes the water off you?
20110108021628.000|20110108021631.000|TR0|
20110108021631.000|20110108021633.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Well, the biggest killer in the 
20110108021633.000|20110108021635.000|TR0|cold is mix of wet and wind, you know, so 
20110108021635.000|20110108021638.000|TR0|if you get out of cold water and you're 
20110108021638.000|20110108021640.000|TR0|wet and, you know, you straight into windy 
20110108021640.000|20110108021642.000|TR0|environment, you just get hypothermic so 
20110108021642.000|20110108021644.000|TR0|fast.  So, even this horrible, it's a 
20110108021644.000|20110108021647.000|TR0|discipline of trying to get try. But, 
20110108021647.000|20110108021649.000|TR0|obviously, I haven't got any towels.  So, 
20110108021649.000|20110108021651.000|TR0|I was using powder snow that's very 
20110108021651.000|20110108021654.000|TR0|absorbent so you can, you know, cover 
20110108021654.000|20110108021656.000|TR0|yourself in powder snow, take the moisture 
20110108021656.000|20110108021658.000|TR0|off you and then you brush the powder snow 
20110108021658.000|20110108021701.000|TR0|off you and you're going to be dry.

20110108021703.000|20110108021705.000|TR0|You know, it doesn't take -- takes a few 
20110108021705.000|20110108021708.000|TR0|seconds but it's worth it. It's just 
20110108021708.000|20110108021710.000|TR0|amazing.  You're putting the clothes on.  
20110108021710.000|20110108021712.000|TR0|You're not getting wet straightaway

20110108021735.000|20110108021737.000|TR0|far out of his comfort zone.  And, you 
20110108021737.000|20110108021740.000|TR0|know, he rang me about a week before we 
20110108021740.000|20110108021742.000|TR0|went and he said, Bear, help.  You know, I 
20110108021742.000|20110108021744.000|TR0|suddenly realize when I'm letting myself 
20110108021744.000|20110108021747.000|TR0|forward, I said, listen, just come on.  No 
20110108021747.000|20110108021749.000|TR0|one tries and just trust me.
20110108021749.000|20110108021751.000|TR0|
20110108021751.000|20110108021754.000|TR0|I gave him his due.  He did.  We picked 
20110108021754.000|20110108021756.000|TR0|him up in the middle of the Arctic and 
20110108021756.000|20110108021758.000|TR0|threw him into this thing and, you know, 
20110108021758.000|20110108021801.000|TR0|he was kind of a bit like shock of 
20110108021801.000|20110108021803.000|TR0|capture, stars eyes wide open.  But his 
20110108021803.000|20110108021805.000|TR0|confidence grew.  And by the end, he was 
20110108021805.000|20110108021807.000|TR0|guiding me across snow faces and ice staff 
20110108021807.000|20110108021810.000|TR0|and, you know, he did brilliantly.  And I 
20110108021810.000|20110108021812.000|TR0|really kind of tip my hat off to him.
20110108021812.000|20110108021814.000|TR0|
20110108021814.000|20110108021817.000|TR0|COOPER:  Do you have a coupe of 
20110108021817.000|20110108021819.000|TR0|celebrities like contacting you and then 
20110108021819.000|20110108021821.000|TR0|kind of bailing out at the last minute 
20110108021821.000|20110108021824.000|TR0|once they realize, wait a minute, what 
20110108021824.000|20110108021826.000|TR0|this really means? GRYLLS:  Yes, it has 
20110108021826.000|20110108021828.000|TR0|happened a few times.  I won't name names. 
20110108021828.000|20110108021830.000|TR0| But, it's kind of you -- it's fun.  You 
20110108021830.000|20110108021833.000|TR0|know, I do love these things on my fun.  
20110108021833.000|20110108021835.000|TR0|So, to take someone else is fun and we're 
20110108021835.000|20110108021837.000|TR0|going to do a couple more of them this 
20110108021837.000|20110108021840.000|TR0|year.  So, that'd be good.
20110108021840.000|20110108021842.000|TR0|
20110108021842.000|20110108021844.000|TR0|And we did this show "Fan Versus Wild" 
20110108021844.000|20110108021847.000|TR0|last year where we had about 30,000 people 
20110108021847.000|20110108021849.000|TR0|applying.  We picked two.
20110108021849.000|20110108021851.000|TR0|
20110108021851.000|20110108021854.000|TR0|And, you know, they're one from the Bronx. 
20110108021854.000|20110108021856.000|TR0| The other was, you know, Michigan and 
20110108021856.000|20110108021858.000|TR0|they'd never done anything out of the city 
20110108021858.000|20110108021900.000|TR0|really, and they kind of had a baptism by 
20110108021900.000|20110108021903.000|TR0|fire.  But again, they threw themselves in 
20110108021903.000|20110108021905.000|TR0|for it and, you know, it's great in that 
20110108021905.000|20110108021907.000|TR0|transformation.  And I think the wild 
20110108021907.000|20110108021910.000|TR0|brings people together in a powerful way 
20110108021910.000|20110108021912.000|TR0|and, you know, seeing the confidence grow 
20110108021912.000|20110108021914.000|TR0|for me it was an amazing thing.  And you 
20110108021914.000|20110108021917.000|TR0|know, again, I kind of admire them.
20110108021917.000|20110108021919.000|TR0|
20110108021919.000|20110108021921.000|TR0|COOPER:  Coming up, more with Bear Grylls. 
20110108021921.000|20110108021923.000|TR0| Also, we'll talk to Dan Woolley, who is 
20110108021923.000|20110108021926.000|TR0|trapped for 65 hours under the rubble 
20110108021926.000|20110108021928.000|TR0|after the Haiti quake.  He reveals how 
20110108021928.000|20110108021930.000|TR0|tips from Bear Grylls' "Man Versus Wild" 
20110108021930.000|20110108021933.000|TR0|helped him survive the ordeal.
20110108021933.000|20110108021935.000|TR0|
20110108021935.000|20110108021937.000|TR0|And later, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter 
20110108021937.000|20110108021940.000|TR0|David Rohde describes his abduction and 
20110108021940.000|20110108021942.000|TR0|remarkable escape from the Taliban.  He 
20110108021942.000|20110108021944.000|TR0|spent seven months in captivity.  His 
20110108021944.000|20110108021947.000|TR0|daring story ahead.

20110108021953.000|20110108021956.000|TR0|COOPER:  Welcome back to this 9:00 edition 
20110108021956.000|20110108021958.000|TR0|of 360.
20110108021958.000|20110108022000.000|TR0|
20110108022000.000|20110108022003.000|TR0|Tonight, we're hearing amazing stories of 
20110108022003.000|20110108022005.000|TR0|survival with Bear Grylls, some survivors 
20110108022005.000|20110108022007.000|TR0|are ordinary people caught in the wrong 
20110108022007.000|20110108022010.000|TR0|place at the wrong time, who do whatever 
20110108022010.000|20110108022012.000|TR0|they have to do to stay alive, to get out.
20110108022012.000|20110108022014.000|TR0|
20110108022014.000|20110108022017.000|TR0|Nearly a year ago, aide worker Dan Woolley 
20110108022017.000|20110108022019.000|TR0|was in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, making a 
20110108022019.000|20110108022021.000|TR0|film about poverty when the quake struck.  
20110108022021.000|20110108022023.000|TR0|He found himself trapped beneath the 
20110108022023.000|20110108022026.000|TR0|rubble of the Hotel Montana, bleeding from 
20110108022026.000|20110108022028.000|TR0|his head and leg.  Incredibly, he also 
20110108022028.000|20110108022030.000|TR0|used survival tactics that he picked 
20110108022030.000|20110108022033.000|TR0|watching Bear Grylls' "Man Versus Wild," 
20110108022033.000|20110108022035.000|TR0|tactics like drinking his own urine.
20110108022035.000|20110108022037.000|TR0|
20110108022037.000|20110108022040.000|TR0|Dan would wait an excruciating 65 hours in 
20110108022040.000|20110108022042.000|TR0|the dark before help finally arrived.
20110108022042.000|20110108022044.000|TR0|
20110108022044.000|20110108022046.000|TR0|Dan, you were trapped in the rubble of the 
20110108022046.000|20110108022049.000|TR0|Montana Hotel when it collapsed during the 
20110108022049.000|20110108022051.000|TR0|earthquake in Haiti last January.  You 
20110108022051.000|20110108022053.000|TR0|write about it in a book, "Unshaken."  
20110108022053.000|20110108022056.000|TR0|What was the moment like when the hotel 
20110108022056.000|20110108022058.000|TR0|collapsed?
20110108022058.000|20110108022100.000|TR0|
20110108022100.000|20110108022103.000|TR0|DAN WOOLLEY, TRAPPED 65 HOURS IN HAITI 
20110108022103.000|20110108022105.000|TR0|EARTHQUAKE RUBBLE:  Well, you know, it was 
20110108022105.000|20110108022107.000|TR0|the kind of thing that happens to you that 
20110108022107.000|20110108022110.000|TR0|you could never expect it and it was 
20110108022110.000|20110108022112.000|TR0|actually beautiful Caribbean afternoon. 
20110108022112.000|20110108022114.000|TR0|I'd just gotten back from filming with 
20110108022114.000|20110108022116.000|TR0|Compassion International, and just walking 
20110108022116.000|20110108022119.000|TR0|through, walking through the lobby and 
20110108022119.000|20110108022121.000|TR0|then, all of a sudden, explosive sounds 
20110108022121.000|20110108022123.000|TR0|and the lobby went from vibrant color to 
20110108022123.000|20110108022126.000|TR0|complete darkness.  And within three 
20110108022126.000|20110108022128.000|TR0|seconds, the entire hotel had collapsed on 
20110108022128.000|20110108022130.000|TR0|top of them. COOPER:  So, the hotel 
20110108022130.000|20110108022133.000|TR0|collapsed immediately during the -- after 
20110108022133.000|20110108022135.000|TR0|the quake or during, it wasn't sometime 
20110108022135.000|20110108022137.000|TR0|later?
20110108022137.000|20110108022139.000|TR0|
20110108022139.000|20110108022142.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  Yes.  Actually, I heard later 
20110108022142.000|20110108022144.000|TR0|that the earthquake lasted 35 seconds, but 
20110108022144.000|20110108022146.000|TR0|I only experienced the first couple 
20110108022146.000|20110108022149.000|TR0|seconds because the hotel started 
20110108022149.000|20110108022151.000|TR0|collapsing right in the first second.
20110108022151.000|20110108022153.000|TR0|
20110108022153.000|20110108022156.000|TR0|COOPER:  And did you -- were you knocked 
20110108022156.000|20110108022158.000|TR0|out were you conscious through the whole 
20110108022158.000|20110108022200.000|TR0|thing?
20110108022200.000|20110108022203.000|TR0|
20110108022203.000|20110108022205.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  As far as I know I was conscious 
20110108022205.000|20110108022207.000|TR0|through the whole thing. When I kind of 
20110108022207.000|20110108022209.000|TR0|came to my senses, I was still standing.  
20110108022209.000|20110108022212.000|TR0|I was in a crouched position.  The ceiling 
20110108022212.000|20110108022214.000|TR0|actually was right at my head and my left 
20110108022214.000|20110108022216.000|TR0|leg was pinned by some of the rubble.
20110108022216.000|20110108022219.000|TR0|
20110108022219.000|20110108022221.000|TR0|COOPER:  But you were -- but you were 
20110108022221.000|20110108022223.000|TR0|standing but your leg was pinned?
20110108022223.000|20110108022226.000|TR0|
20110108022226.000|20110108022228.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  Yes, exactly.
20110108022228.000|20110108022230.000|TR0|
20110108022230.000|20110108022232.000|TR0|COOPER:  And how long did the ordeal -- I 
20110108022232.000|20110108022235.000|TR0|mean, how long did you stay like that?
20110108022235.000|20110108022237.000|TR0|
20110108022237.000|20110108022239.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  You know, at first, it was just 
20110108022239.000|20110108022242.000|TR0|chaos.  I was just trying to figure out 
20110108022242.000|20110108022244.000|TR0|what just happened to me and, you know, 
20110108022244.000|20110108022246.000|TR0|what is my situation and then --
20110108022246.000|20110108022249.000|TR0|
20110108022249.000|20110108022251.000|TR0|COOPER:  Sorry, we're looking at pictures 
20110108022251.000|20110108022253.000|TR0|that you actually took while you were 
20110108022253.000|20110108022256.000|TR0|stuck.
20110108022256.000|20110108022258.000|TR0|
20110108022258.000|20110108022300.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  I did.  While I was in complete 
20110108022300.000|20110108022302.000|TR0|darkness and so, I wondered at first if I 
20110108022302.000|20110108022305.000|TR0|was blind and, you know, Bear often talks 
20110108022305.000|20110108022307.000|TR0|about using the resources you have at hand 
20110108022307.000|20110108022309.000|TR0|and I realized I had my camera around my 
20110108022309.000|20110108022312.000|TR0|neck and so, in the darkness, I started 
20110108022312.000|20110108022314.000|TR0|flashing my camera around and when I still 
20110108022314.000|20110108022316.000|TR0|couldn't see enough, I actually took some 
20110108022316.000|20110108022319.000|TR0|pictures with my camera and look at the 
20110108022319.000|20110108022321.000|TR0|back of the camera to see figure out, OK, 
20110108022321.000|20110108022323.000|TR0|what's that that I just took a picture of.
20110108022323.000|20110108022325.000|TR0|
20110108022325.000|20110108022328.000|TR0|COOPER:  You reference Bear.  You watched 
20110108022328.000|20110108022330.000|TR0|his show before?
20110108022330.000|20110108022332.000|TR0|
20110108022332.000|20110108022335.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  Yes, actually.  I have two boys, 
20110108022335.000|20110108022337.000|TR0|7 and 4, and we're big fans of the show, 
20110108022337.000|20110108022339.000|TR0|so we had actually watched the show a lot. 
20110108022339.000|20110108022342.000|TR0| So, you know, I was inspired during my 
20110108022342.000|20110108022344.000|TR0|ordeal.
20110108022344.000|20110108022346.000|TR0|
20110108022346.000|20110108022349.000|TR0|COOPER:  Bear, when you hear that, that's 
20110108022349.000|20110108022351.000|TR0|got to be pretty cool starting out doing 
20110108022351.000|20110108022353.000|TR0|this you didn't think people whose lives 
20110108022353.000|20110108022355.000|TR0|will be impacted very literally and saved 
20110108022355.000|20110108022358.000|TR0|by stuff you've done.
20110108022358.000|20110108022400.000|TR0|
20110108022400.000|20110108022402.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Yes, it is.  It's really 
20110108022402.000|20110108022405.000|TR0|encouraging to hear.  And, you know, I 
20110108022405.000|20110108022407.000|TR0|hear stories like Dan's and I'm just so 
20110108022407.000|20110108022409.000|TR0|full of, you know, admiration.  And, you 
20110108022409.000|20110108022412.000|TR0|know, he's got the heart of a survivor.
20110108022412.000|20110108022414.000|TR0|
20110108022414.000|20110108022416.000|TR0|But, you know, I spent lot of time kind of 
20110108022416.000|20110108022419.000|TR0|cold, wet and miserable in these jungles 
20110108022419.000|20110108022421.000|TR0|and think is anyone going to ever watch 
20110108022421.000|20110108022423.000|TR0|this stuff.  So, for me, it's really 
20110108022423.000|20110108022425.000|TR0|encouraging.  So, it's nice to hear Dan.  
20110108022425.000|20110108022428.000|TR0|But, your story's amazing. COOPER:  Dan, 
20110108022428.000|20110108022430.000|TR0|you had also an iPhone with you that you 
20110108022430.000|20110108022432.000|TR0|used.  How did you use that?
20110108022432.000|20110108022435.000|TR0|
20110108022435.000|20110108022437.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  I did.  After I moved to a safer 
20110108022437.000|20110108022439.000|TR0|place from that initial spot, I moved to 
20110108022439.000|20110108022442.000|TR0|an elevator car and after that, I started 
20110108022442.000|20110108022444.000|TR0|looking at the wounds and I had a big gash 
20110108022444.000|20110108022446.000|TR0|from my knee to my ankle.  And it was the 
20110108022446.000|20110108022448.000|TR0|worst wound I'd ever seen in my life.  And 
20110108022448.000|20110108022451.000|TR0|I felt myself starting to go into shock 
20110108022451.000|20110108022453.000|TR0|and I was concerned about my ability to 
20110108022453.000|20110108022455.000|TR0|treat my wounds.
20110108022455.000|20110108022458.000|TR0|
20110108022458.000|20110108022500.000|TR0|I'd survived an earthquake.  I was 
20110108022500.000|20110108022502.000|TR0|determined to survive as long as I could, 
20110108022502.000|20110108022505.000|TR0|get back to my family and I didn't want to 
20110108022505.000|20110108022507.000|TR0|die just because I didn't know how to 
20110108022507.000|20110108022509.000|TR0|treat my wounds.  So, I remembered I had 
20110108022509.000|20110108022512.000|TR0|my iPhone. There was no signal on it, but 
20110108022512.000|20110108022514.000|TR0|I had a first aid app pre-downloaded and 
20110108022514.000|20110108022516.000|TR0|had some information how to take care of 
20110108022516.000|20110108022518.000|TR0|excessive bleeding and also shock.
20110108022518.000|20110108022521.000|TR0|
20110108022521.000|20110108022523.000|TR0|COOPER:  And how long were you trapped for?
20110108022523.000|20110108022525.000|TR0|
20110108022525.000|20110108022528.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  I was trapped for 65 hours, 
20110108022528.000|20110108022530.000|TR0|about two and a half days.
20110108022530.000|20110108022532.000|TR0|
20110108022532.000|20110108022535.000|TR0|COOPER:  And how did you stay hydrated?  I 
20110108022535.000|20110108022537.000|TR0|mean, did you have water with you?
20110108022537.000|20110108022539.000|TR0|
20110108022539.000|20110108022541.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  I didn't have any water with me. 
20110108022541.000|20110108022544.000|TR0| Actually, one of the things specifically 
20110108022544.000|20110108022546.000|TR0|with Bear I remembered from one of his 
20110108022546.000|20110108022548.000|TR0|shows that he said you can die within 
20110108022548.000|20110108022551.000|TR0|three days from dehydration and, you know, 
20110108022551.000|20110108022553.000|TR0|in a survival situation, you just do 
20110108022553.000|20110108022555.000|TR0|whatever you have to do to stay alive.  
20110108022555.000|20110108022558.000|TR0|So, he had actually demonstrated -- I 
20110108022558.000|20110108022600.000|TR0|think on the Will Ferrell show, he'd 
20110108022600.000|20110108022602.000|TR0|demonstrated drinking your own urine.
20110108022602.000|20110108022605.000|TR0|
20110108022605.000|20110108022607.000|TR0|So, I kind of did the same way that I saw 
20110108022607.000|20110108022609.000|TR0|in the show, and that, in my mind, helped 
20110108022609.000|20110108022611.000|TR0|to extend the time frame for me.
20110108022611.000|20110108022614.000|TR0|
20110108022614.000|20110108022616.000|TR0|COOPER:  Was there -- was there a moment 
20110108022616.000|20110108022618.000|TR0|you were like I'm not going to do this 
20110108022618.000|20110108022621.000|TR0|because it's drinking my urine, or at that 
20110108022621.000|20110108022623.000|TR0|point, you're just thinking, I'm thirsty 
20110108022623.000|20110108022625.000|TR0|and this is what I need to do?
20110108022625.000|20110108022628.000|TR0|
20110108022628.000|20110108022630.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  You know what?  It was easy 
20110108022630.000|20110108022632.000|TR0|decision because, you know, in my mind, I 
20110108022632.000|20110108022634.000|TR0|was going to do anything to get back to my 
20110108022634.000|20110108022637.000|TR0|family and so -- so, you know, I'm 
20110108022637.000|20110108022639.000|TR0|thinking, wow, I need liquid.  I need -- 
20110108022639.000|20110108022641.000|TR0|I'm very dehydrated, liquid's pouring out 
20110108022641.000|20110108022644.000|TR0|of me.  I want to -- you know, gosh, if I 
20110108022644.000|20110108022646.000|TR0|could use this.  And I realized, gosh, I 
20110108022646.000|20110108022648.000|TR0|could catch it in my shirt, I could, you 
20110108022648.000|20110108022651.000|TR0|know, filter it a little bit.  If that 
20110108022651.000|20110108022653.000|TR0|could extend my time frame, who cares 
20110108022653.000|20110108022655.000|TR0|about squeamishness?  I'll do whatever I 
20110108022655.000|20110108022658.000|TR0|have to do to.
20110108022658.000|20110108022700.000|TR0|
20110108022700.000|20110108022702.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, you know, Dan, Bear talks 
20110108022702.000|20110108022704.000|TR0|about trying to remain calm. Was that an 
20110108022704.000|20110108022707.000|TR0|issue for you immediately after the 
20110108022707.000|20110108022709.000|TR0|earthquake?  I mean, were you able to -- 
20110108022709.000|20110108022711.000|TR0|were you panicked?
20110108022711.000|20110108022714.000|TR0|
20110108022714.000|20110108022716.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  You know what?  I never 
20110108022716.000|20110108022718.000|TR0|experienced panic.  In the initial seconds 
20110108022718.000|20110108022721.000|TR0|of chaos, I probably had a little bit of 
20110108022721.000|20110108022723.000|TR0|that feeling but I found a calm kind of 
20110108022723.000|20110108022725.000|TR0|come over me and that's where I think my 
20110108022725.000|20110108022727.000|TR0|faith, I think God intervened and gave me 
20110108022727.000|20110108022730.000|TR0|a sense of calm in those moments. And so, 
20110108022730.000|20110108022732.000|TR0|I really appreciate that because my mind 
20110108022732.000|20110108022734.000|TR0|kicked in to gear and said, all right, 
20110108022734.000|20110108022737.000|TR0|what do I do with this situation?  And I 
20110108022737.000|20110108022739.000|TR0|was able to get myself to the elevator 
20110108022739.000|20110108022741.000|TR0|before seven minutes after the initial 
20110108022741.000|20110108022744.000|TR0|earthquake, 6.0 aftershock hit and would 
20110108022744.000|20110108022746.000|TR0|have killed me.
20110108022746.000|20110108022748.000|TR0|
20110108022748.000|20110108022751.000|TR0|COOPER:  And certainly, a lot of people 
20110108022751.000|20110108022753.000|TR0|lost their lives in the Montana.  I was at 
20110108022753.000|20110108022755.000|TR0|the scene many times and it's -- it's 
20110108022755.000|20110108022757.000|TR0|amazing that you were able to survive from 
20110108022757.000|20110108022800.000|TR0|that because it's -- when you actually see 
20110108022800.000|20110108022802.000|TR0|how it collapsed just stunning.
20110108022802.000|20110108022804.000|TR0|
20110108022804.000|20110108022807.000|TR0|Bear, is there anything in the situation 
20110108022807.000|20110108022809.000|TR0|like that that you would recommend?
20110108022809.000|20110108022811.000|TR0|
20110108022811.000|20110108022814.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Well, it's really interesting 
20110108022814.000|20110108022816.000|TR0|hearing Dan speak and, you know, I have 
20110108022816.000|20110108022818.000|TR0|heard a few key words from him.  One is 
20110108022818.000|20110108022821.000|TR0|faith and, you know, survival is so much 
20110108022821.000|20110108022823.000|TR0|of what's going on inside your heart and 
20110108022823.000|20110108022825.000|TR0|your mind, and, you know, faith is such an 
20110108022825.000|20110108022827.000|TR0|important part of driving us on and 
20110108022827.000|20110108022830.000|TR0|wanting to get back to your family, as 
20110108022830.000|20110108022832.000|TR0|well.
20110108022832.000|20110108022834.000|TR0|
20110108022834.000|20110108022837.000|TR0|You know, motivation is so key.  You know, 
20110108022837.000|20110108022839.000|TR0|he talked about resources and thinking 
20110108022839.000|20110108022841.000|TR0|left field.  That's why he used the camera 
20110108022841.000|20110108022844.000|TR0|to take pictures and give him an idea of 
20110108022844.000|20110108022846.000|TR0|what was around him.  He used his iPhone.
20110108022846.000|20110108022848.000|TR0|
20110108022848.000|20110108022850.000|TR0|You know, if people think, what use is an 
20110108022850.000|20110108022853.000|TR0|iPhone?  But it's all about what's around 
20110108022853.000|20110108022855.000|TR0|you.  I have an app out that's just 
20110108022855.000|20110108022857.000|TR0|launched, Bear Essentials with all the 
20110108022857.000|20110108022900.000|TR0|first aid and that and everything.  
20110108022900.000|20110108022902.000|TR0|Actually, it's more than just an app.  He 
20110108022902.000|20110108022904.000|TR0|had a first aid one on his phone.  He used 
20110108022904.000|20110108022907.000|TR0|that.  It could help him.
20110108022907.000|20110108022909.000|TR0|
20110108022909.000|20110108022911.000|TR0|And then you hear him talk about 
20110108022911.000|20110108022914.000|TR0|prioritizing.  And, you know, again, you 
20110108022914.000|20110108022916.000|TR0|have to conserve water.  Put your 
20110108022916.000|20110108022918.000|TR0|squeamishness aside.  If he has to drink 
20110108022918.000|20110108022920.000|TR0|pee and he's hydrating enough and it can 
20110108022920.000|20110108022923.000|TR0|help him, he can do that.  You know, he 
20110108022923.000|20110108022925.000|TR0|had a wound.
20110108022925.000|20110108022927.000|TR0|
20110108022927.000|20110108022930.000|TR0|Again, if you don't look after that 
20110108022930.000|20110108022932.000|TR0|prioritize that, you're going to bleed to 
20110108022932.000|20110108022934.000|TR0|death.  So, you know, I hear that and I 
20110108022934.000|20110108022937.000|TR0|think what a great kind of example of 
20110108022937.000|20110108022939.000|TR0|getting it right and, you know, all of our 
20110108022939.000|20110108022941.000|TR0|survival in life is about the decisions: 
20110108022941.000|20110108022943.000|TR0|do we go this way or do we that?  And, you 
20110108022943.000|20110108022946.000|TR0|know, he just made a series of good 
20110108022946.000|20110108022948.000|TR0|decisions and those good decisions why he 
20110108022948.000|20110108022950.000|TR0|is with us today and amazing story.
20110108022950.000|20110108022953.000|TR0|
20110108022953.000|20110108022955.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes.  Dan, truly amazing.  It's 
20110108022955.000|20110108022957.000|TR0|good to talk to you, Dan. Dan Woolley, 
20110108022957.000|20110108023000.000|TR0|thanks very much.

20110108023002.000|20110108023004.000|TR0|WOOLLEY:  Thanks.

20110108023007.000|20110108023009.000|TR0|COOPER:  Ahead, more survival stories.  
20110108023009.000|20110108023011.000|TR0|We're going to talk to "New York Times" 
20110108023011.000|20110108023013.000|TR0|reporter David Rohde who was working on a 
20110108023013.000|20110108023016.000|TR0|book in Afghanistan when he was kidnapped 
20110108023016.000|20110108023018.000|TR0|by the Taliban.  He shares with us how he 
20110108023018.000|20110108023020.000|TR0|survived more than seven months in 
20110108023020.000|20110108023023.000|TR0|captivity and made a daring escape.
20110108023023.000|20110108023025.000|TR0|
20110108023025.000|20110108023027.000|TR0|You'll also meet the teen who got lost an 
20110108023027.000|20110108023030.000|TR0|Oregon mountain during a ski trip in 
20110108023030.000|20110108023032.000|TR0|sub-zero temperatures.  Jake Denham is his 
20110108023032.000|20110108023034.000|TR0|name and he used skills he learned from 
20110108023034.000|20110108023036.000|TR0|Bear Grylls' "Man Versus Wild" to make it 
20110108023036.000|20110108023039.000|TR0|out alive from his nine-hour ordeal.

20110108023046.000|20110108023048.000|TR0|COOPER:  Welcome back to the special 9:00 
20110108023048.000|20110108023050.000|TR0|360, "Survivor Stories with Bear Grylls."
20110108023050.000|20110108023053.000|TR0|
20110108023053.000|20110108023055.000|TR0|Our next story takes us to a war zone.  We 
20110108023055.000|20110108023057.000|TR0|take you back to November 2008 and a 
20110108023057.000|20110108023100.000|TR0|veteran "New York Times" reporter named 
20110108023100.000|20110108023102.000|TR0|David Rode (ph) was researching a book 
20110108023102.000|20110108023104.000|TR0|when he and two Afghan colleagues were 
20110108023104.000|20110108023106.000|TR0|kidnapped in Afghanistan by the Taliban.  
20110108023106.000|20110108023109.000|TR0|They were taken to Pakistan, to North 
20110108023109.000|20110108023111.000|TR0|Waziristan and held captive less than a 
20110108023111.000|20110108023113.000|TR0|half mile from a Pakistani military base.
20110108023113.000|20110108023116.000|TR0|
20110108023116.000|20110108023118.000|TR0|Seven months and ten days after their 
20110108023118.000|20110108023120.000|TR0|ordeal began, in June of 2009, David Rhode 
20110108023120.000|20110108023123.000|TR0|made a daring escape in the dark of night. 
20110108023123.000|20110108023125.000|TR0| He and another captive used a rope to 
20110108023125.000|20110108023127.000|TR0|lower themselves down a wall, and made a 
20110108023127.000|20110108023129.000|TR0|run for the nearby military base.  They 
20110108023129.000|20110108023132.000|TR0|almost got killed on their way.
20110108023132.000|20110108023134.000|TR0|
20110108023134.000|20110108023136.000|TR0|David and his wife write about what they 
20110108023136.000|20110108023139.000|TR0|faced in those seven months in the book "A 
20110108023139.000|20110108023141.000|TR0|Rope and A Prayer, A Kidnapping From Two 
20110108023141.000|20110108023143.000|TR0|Sides."
20110108023143.000|20110108023146.000|TR0|
20110108023146.000|20110108023148.000|TR0|David, your circumstances are definitely 
20110108023148.000|20110108023150.000|TR0|unique.  Not every day someone survived a 
20110108023150.000|20110108023153.000|TR0|kidnapping by the Taliban.  I got to say, 
20110108023153.000|20110108023155.000|TR0|kidnapping is probably my greatest fear in 
20110108023155.000|20110108023157.000|TR0|the work that I do and you do the same for 
20110108023157.000|20110108023159.000|TR0|-- you were working for "New York Times."
20110108023159.000|20110108023202.000|TR0|
20110108023202.000|20110108023204.000|TR0|What was the key to getting through for 
20110108023204.000|20110108023206.000|TR0|you?  I mean, obviously, there were things 
20110108023206.000|20110108023209.000|TR0|going on beyond your control.  But in your 
20110108023209.000|20110108023211.000|TR0|own head, in your own circumstances, what 
20110108023211.000|20110108023213.000|TR0|was the key to surviving kidnapping?
20110108023213.000|20110108023216.000|TR0|
20110108023216.000|20110108023218.000|TR0|DAVID RHODE, SURVIVED KIDNAPPING BY 
20110108023218.000|20110108023220.000|TR0|TALIBAN:  It was a concept that my wife 
20110108023220.000|20110108023223.000|TR0|talked about.  It's surrendering but not 
20110108023223.000|20110108023225.000|TR0|giving up, and having the faith, you know, 
20110108023225.000|20110108023227.000|TR0|that you guys have been talking about 
20110108023227.000|20110108023229.000|TR0|earlier in the show.
20110108023229.000|20110108023232.000|TR0|
20110108023232.000|20110108023234.000|TR0|You know, we waited.  We were very 
20110108023234.000|20110108023236.000|TR0|patient.  We sort of played along with our 
20110108023236.000|20110108023239.000|TR0|captors and waited for the right 
20110108023239.000|20110108023241.000|TR0|opportunity to come.  And it did come.  
20110108023241.000|20110108023243.000|TR0|And then when we, you know, made a 
20110108023243.000|20110108023246.000|TR0|decision to try to escape, it worked.  And 
20110108023246.000|20110108023248.000|TR0|it is sort of a combination of things.
20110108023248.000|20110108023250.000|TR0|
20110108023250.000|20110108023252.000|TR0|You know, you can't be too sort of willful 
20110108023252.000|20110108023255.000|TR0|and impatient.  You have to be sort of 
20110108023255.000|20110108023257.000|TR0|humble and wait for the moment when you're 
20110108023257.000|20110108023259.000|TR0|lucky.  And it came for us.
20110108023259.000|20110108023302.000|TR0|
20110108023302.000|20110108023304.000|TR0|COOPER:  How did you not let your mind run 
20110108023304.000|20110108023306.000|TR0|away with you?  I mean, because I think 
20110108023306.000|20110108023309.000|TR0|about, you know, journalists who have been 
20110108023309.000|20110108023311.000|TR0|kidnapped for seven years.  Terry Anderson 
20110108023311.000|20110108023313.000|TR0|in Beirut chained to a radiator for years. 
20110108023313.000|20110108023316.000|TR0| Or you hear about contractors in Iraq who 
20110108023316.000|20110108023318.000|TR0|were, you know, literally buried alive in 
20110108023318.000|20110108023320.000|TR0|shallow graves and kind of stored there 
20110108023320.000|20110108023322.000|TR0|and occasionally checked on.  How do you 
20110108023322.000|20110108023325.000|TR0|not allow your mind to kind of imagine the 
20110108023325.000|20110108023327.000|TR0|worse?
20110108023327.000|20110108023329.000|TR0|
20110108023329.000|20110108023332.000|TR0|RHODE:  I think part of it is my family.  
20110108023332.000|20110108023334.000|TR0|My family is -- we're all from New 
20110108023334.000|20110108023336.000|TR0|England.  They're sort of these stoic New 
20110108023336.000|20110108023339.000|TR0|Englanders who said you just kind of wait 
20110108023339.000|20110108023341.000|TR0|and hope things will turn out for the 
20110108023341.000|20110108023343.000|TR0|best.  I had a couple of communications 
20110108023343.000|20110108023345.000|TR0|with my wife.  She sort of told me you 
20110108023345.000|20110108023348.000|TR0|must be strong because I'm strong.  And 
20110108023348.000|20110108023350.000|TR0|that -- those were sort of the key things. 
20110108023350.000|20110108023352.000|TR0| And in the end, frankly, for us, we sort 
20110108023352.000|20110108023355.000|TR0|of when it came to escaping decided that, 
20110108023355.000|20110108023357.000|TR0|you know, death was a possibility.  And we 
20110108023357.000|20110108023359.000|TR0|were ready for that.
20110108023359.000|20110108023402.000|TR0|
20110108023402.000|20110108023404.000|TR0|We kind of accepted it.  It's inevitable.  
20110108023404.000|20110108023406.000|TR0|We all are going to face it at some point 
20110108023406.000|20110108023409.000|TR0|and we essentially, you know, wanted our 
20110108023409.000|20110108023411.000|TR0|captors to get nothing.  So we took that 
20110108023411.000|20110108023413.000|TR0|risk and it paid off.
20110108023413.000|20110108023415.000|TR0|
20110108023415.000|20110108023418.000|TR0|COOPER:  I know you sang songs also at 
20110108023418.000|20110108023420.000|TR0|times.  I think "Born to Run" was one of 
20110108023420.000|20110108023422.000|TR0|them.  What -- that was, what, at the 
20110108023422.000|20110108023425.000|TR0|urging of your captors?
20110108023425.000|20110108023427.000|TR0|
20110108023427.000|20110108023429.000|TR0|RHODE:  Yeah.  They -- the Taliban -- they 
20110108023429.000|20110108023432.000|TR0|were bored, as well.  The months and 
20110108023432.000|20110108023434.000|TR0|months went by.  So we would sing songs 
20110108023434.000|20110108023436.000|TR0|first in Pashtun, the local language.  
20110108023436.000|20110108023438.000|TR0|They had a Taliban song they had me sing 
20110108023438.000|20110108023441.000|TR0|in the local language called "You Have 
20110108023441.000|20110108023443.000|TR0|Atomic Bombs, But We Have Suicide Bombers."
20110108023443.000|20110108023445.000|TR0|
20110108023445.000|20110108023448.000|TR0|And then they wanted to hear some American 
20110108023448.000|20110108023450.000|TR0|tunes.  So I sang "Born to Run."  I was 
20110108023450.000|20110108023452.000|TR0|trying to convince them that Americans 
20110108023452.000|20110108023455.000|TR0|weren't all rich, as they thought they 
20110108023455.000|20110108023457.000|TR0|were.  And then there was a love song, 
20110108023457.000|20110108023459.000|TR0|actually that they -- excuse me, there was 
20110108023459.000|20110108023502.000|TR0|a love song that they loved the most.  It 
20110108023502.000|20110108023504.000|TR0|was a Beatles song "She Loves You," and 
20110108023504.000|20110108023506.000|TR0|that had popped into my head after I got a 
20110108023506.000|20110108023508.000|TR0|letter from my wife.
20110108023508.000|20110108023511.000|TR0|
20110108023511.000|20110108023513.000|TR0|So I would sit around and, you know, I 
20110108023513.000|20110108023515.000|TR0|would sing the lyrics to the "She Loves 
20110108023515.000|20110108023518.000|TR0|You," the Beatles' song, and they would 
20110108023518.000|20110108023520.000|TR0|sing the chorus, my guards, as we had 
20110108023520.000|20110108023522.000|TR0|these Kalishnikov assault rifles laying on 
20110108023522.000|20110108023525.000|TR0|the floor around us.
20110108023525.000|20110108023527.000|TR0|
20110108023527.000|20110108023529.000|TR0|COOPER:  Were you wanting to humanize 
20110108023529.000|20110108023531.000|TR0|yourself in their eyes?  You hear that a 
20110108023531.000|20110108023534.000|TR0|lot about a strategy.
20110108023534.000|20110108023536.000|TR0|
20110108023536.000|20110108023538.000|TR0|RHODE:  Yeah.  That was definitely part of 
20110108023538.000|20110108023541.000|TR0|it.  I had been married two months before. 
20110108023541.000|20110108023543.000|TR0| I enacted my -- reenacted my wedding for 
20110108023543.000|20110108023545.000|TR0|them.  You know, I did try to get them to 
20110108023545.000|20110108023548.000|TR0|humanize me.  And we talked about faith.  
20110108023548.000|20110108023550.000|TR0|And it was funny and sad in a way, because 
20110108023550.000|20110108023552.000|TR0|I am sort of a skeptic of organized 
20110108023552.000|20110108023555.000|TR0|religion.  I have seen it -- religious 
20110108023555.000|20110108023557.000|TR0|extremes do terrible things.  And their 
20110108023557.000|20110108023559.000|TR0|religious extreme made them see me as kind 
20110108023559.000|20110108023601.000|TR0|of subhuman.
20110108023601.000|20110108023604.000|TR0|
20110108023604.000|20110108023606.000|TR0|But I also see religion as a sort of 
20110108023606.000|20110108023608.000|TR0|positive thing.  Any kind of tradition 
20110108023608.000|20110108023611.000|TR0|that makes you feel more humble towards 
20110108023611.000|20110108023613.000|TR0|whatever power you believe in, and 
20110108023613.000|20110108023615.000|TR0|anything that makes you sort of have 
20110108023615.000|20110108023618.000|TR0|empathy towards other human beings, you 
20110108023618.000|20110108023620.000|TR0|know.  And that helped me.
20110108023620.000|20110108023622.000|TR0|
20110108023622.000|20110108023625.000|TR0|I did say prayers every day.  They were 
20110108023625.000|20110108023627.000|TR0|prayers about humility, about forgiveness 
20110108023627.000|20110108023629.000|TR0|and that -- that kept me going, as well.
20110108023629.000|20110108023631.000|TR0|
20110108023631.000|20110108023634.000|TR0|COOPER:  Bear, obviously, a kidnapping is 
20110108023634.000|20110108023636.000|TR0|a situation you haven't been part of.  Any 
20110108023636.000|20110108023638.000|TR0|advice to folks out there or thoughts 
20110108023638.000|20110108023641.000|TR0|about it?
20110108023641.000|20110108023643.000|TR0|
20110108023643.000|20110108023645.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Well, it is interesting.  You 
20110108023645.000|20110108023648.000|TR0|know, it is just a different playing 
20110108023648.000|20110108023650.000|TR0|field.  You know, survival comes in lots 
20110108023650.000|20110108023652.000|TR0|of different guises, whether it's Haiti, 
20110108023652.000|20110108023654.000|TR0|you know, or the Taliban kidnapping.  But 
20110108023654.000|20110108023657.000|TR0|it's interesting hearing this thing about 
20110108023657.000|20110108023659.000|TR0|faith again.
20110108023659.000|20110108023701.000|TR0|
20110108023701.000|20110108023704.000|TR0|And for me, my Christian faith has helped 
20110108023704.000|20110108023706.000|TR0|me so much, in so many difficult times, 
20110108023706.000|20110108023708.000|TR0|through the military, through my accident, 
20110108023708.000|20110108023711.000|TR0|high up on mountains.  You know, it is 
20110108023711.000|20110108023713.000|TR0|about for me finding a quiet strength in 
20110108023713.000|20110108023715.000|TR0|the big moments.  And my Christian faith 
20110108023715.000|20110108023718.000|TR0|has definitely helped me so much like that.
20110108023718.000|20110108023720.000|TR0|
20110108023720.000|20110108023722.000|TR0|But, you know, it's interesting again 
20110108023722.000|20110108023724.000|TR0|hearing from David the thing of surrender, 
20110108023724.000|20110108023727.000|TR0|but don't give up.  And it's just that 
20110108023727.000|20110108023729.000|TR0|humility, but also having the iron will 
20110108023729.000|20110108023731.000|TR0|underneath it.  Again, you know, it is 
20110108023731.000|20110108023734.000|TR0|what carried him through.
20110108023734.000|20110108023736.000|TR0|
20110108023736.000|20110108023738.000|TR0|COOPER:  David, in terms of not giving up, 
20110108023738.000|20110108023741.000|TR0|how often were you thinking about 
20110108023741.000|20110108023743.000|TR0|escaping?  And how did you plan your 
20110108023743.000|20110108023745.000|TR0|escape?
20110108023745.000|20110108023747.000|TR0|
20110108023747.000|20110108023750.000|TR0|RHODE:  We thought of it constantly.  The 
20110108023750.000|20110108023752.000|TR0|question was -- and we almost tried 
20110108023752.000|20110108023754.000|TR0|several times earlier in the seven months.
20110108023754.000|20110108023757.000|TR0|
20110108023757.000|20110108023759.000|TR0|COOPER:  I'm sorry.  You were being held 
20110108023759.000|20110108023801.000|TR0|with what?  One other person?
20110108023801.000|20110108023804.000|TR0|
20110108023804.000|20110108023806.000|TR0|RHODE:  Yes, I was with two other people, 
20110108023806.000|20110108023808.000|TR0|Afghan colleagues, an Afghan journalists 
20110108023808.000|20110108023811.000|TR0|and an Afghan driver working with me.  
20110108023811.000|20110108023813.000|TR0|And, again, you know, creativity.  I found 
20110108023813.000|20110108023815.000|TR0|a car two rope.  And I realized that we 
20110108023815.000|20110108023817.000|TR0|could use it to lower ourselves down this 
20110108023817.000|20110108023820.000|TR0|wall.  My Afghan colleague had sort of 
20110108023820.000|20110108023822.000|TR0|scouted out the town.  He had gotten the 
20110108023822.000|20110108023824.000|TR0|guards to take him outside on shopping 
20110108023824.000|20110108023827.000|TR0|trips.
20110108023827.000|20110108023829.000|TR0|
20110108023829.000|20110108023831.000|TR0|And we realized there was a Pakistani 
20110108023831.000|20110108023834.000|TR0|military base nearby.  So while the guards 
20110108023834.000|20110108023836.000|TR0|were asleep, the electricity just come 
20110108023836.000|20110108023838.000|TR0|back on that day. There was a ceiling fan 
20110108023838.000|20110108023840.000|TR0|and a cooler that covered the noise of us 
20110108023840.000|20110108023843.000|TR0|creeping out of the room.  We used the 
20110108023843.000|20110108023845.000|TR0|rope to lower ourselves down a wall.  And 
20110108023845.000|20110108023847.000|TR0|then my Afghan colleague guided me to this 
20110108023847.000|20110108023850.000|TR0|base.
20110108023850.000|20110108023852.000|TR0|
20110108023852.000|20110108023854.000|TR0|We were nearly shot at the base, again, 
20110108023854.000|20110108023857.000|TR0|staying calm.  We didn't move. We did 
20110108023857.000|20110108023859.000|TR0|exactly what the guards told us.  They 
20110108023859.000|20110108023901.000|TR0|thought we were suicide bombers.  I had a 
20110108023901.000|20110108023904.000|TR0|beard down to about here and was dressed 
20110108023904.000|20110108023906.000|TR0|in local clothes.  So, again, staying 
20110108023906.000|20110108023908.000|TR0|calm, being patient paid off.  We were 
20110108023908.000|20110108023910.000|TR0|allowed on that base.  And I'm very lucky 
20110108023910.000|20110108023913.000|TR0|to be home today.
20110108023913.000|20110108023915.000|TR0|
20110108023915.000|20110108023917.000|TR0|COOPER:  But you were prepared to die?  I 
20110108023917.000|20110108023920.000|TR0|mean, escape was that important to you at 
20110108023920.000|20110108023922.000|TR0|that point?  You felt like staying here is 
20110108023922.000|20110108023924.000|TR0|no longer an option?
20110108023924.000|20110108023927.000|TR0|
20110108023927.000|20110108023929.000|TR0|RHODE:  I was furious at my captors.  I 
20110108023929.000|20110108023931.000|TR0|really had come to hate them, particularly 
20110108023931.000|20110108023933.000|TR0|for what they were doing to my family.  
20110108023933.000|20110108023936.000|TR0|Kidnapping is a really personal crime.  
20110108023936.000|20110108023938.000|TR0|They essentially were making my wife -- 
20110108023938.000|20110108023940.000|TR0|they were calling her and making her feel 
20110108023940.000|20110108023943.000|TR0|like she held my life in her hands, and if 
20110108023943.000|20110108023945.000|TR0|she could just raise the millions of 
20110108023945.000|20110108023947.000|TR0|dollars they wanted, then I would be free.
20110108023947.000|20110108023950.000|TR0|
20110108023950.000|20110108023952.000|TR0|I mean, they said they were part of the 
20110108023952.000|20110108023954.000|TR0|pious religious movement, but they were 
20110108023954.000|20110108023957.000|TR0|really very greedy to me.  So it was a 
20110108023957.000|20110108023959.000|TR0|risk.  I didn't want to die.  I was very 
20110108023959.000|20110108024001.000|TR0|sad at the concept of dying and not having 
20110108024001.000|20110108024003.000|TR0|the life I had hoped with my wife.  But I 
20110108024003.000|20110108024006.000|TR0|really wanted the thing to end. I wanted 
20110108024006.000|20110108024008.000|TR0|my wife to not go through the suffering, 
20110108024008.000|20110108024010.000|TR0|my family.  And we had our opportunity and 
20110108024010.000|20110108024013.000|TR0|we took it.  COOPER:  When you were 
20110108024013.000|20110108024015.000|TR0|escaping, I mean, were you solely focused 
20110108024015.000|20110108024017.000|TR0|on the mission at hand?
20110108024017.000|20110108024020.000|TR0|
20110108024020.000|20110108024022.000|TR0|RHODE:  Before I escaped, to be honest, I 
20110108024022.000|20110108024024.000|TR0|had -- one of the Taliban had told me that 
20110108024024.000|20110108024027.000|TR0|they had this tradition where you say 
20110108024027.000|20110108024029.000|TR0|forgive me God a thousand times each day.  
20110108024029.000|20110108024031.000|TR0|He told me this months earlier.  He said 
20110108024031.000|20110108024033.000|TR0|if you say forgive me God a thousand 
20110108024033.000|20110108024036.000|TR0|times, your captivity will end.
20110108024036.000|20110108024038.000|TR0|
20110108024038.000|20110108024040.000|TR0|I said it, frankly, as a way to pass the 
20110108024040.000|20110108024043.000|TR0|time.  The prayers were something I could 
20110108024043.000|20110108024045.000|TR0|do that the guards couldn't take away from 
20110108024045.000|20110108024047.000|TR0|me. Before I escaped, I literally laid 
20110108024047.000|20110108024050.000|TR0|there in the darkness and said forgive me 
20110108024050.000|20110108024052.000|TR0|God 2,000 times.
20110108024052.000|20110108024054.000|TR0|
20110108024054.000|20110108024056.000|TR0|And then as the kind of escape -- we went 
20110108024056.000|20110108024059.000|TR0|through it, I think all people --  look, 
20110108024059.000|20110108024101.000|TR0|people -- everyone survives.  People get 
20110108024101.000|20110108024103.000|TR0|diagnosed with cancer every day in this 
20110108024103.000|20110108024106.000|TR0|country.  They don't know what is going to 
20110108024106.000|20110108024108.000|TR0|happen.  They face mortality.  The human 
20110108024108.000|20110108024110.000|TR0|brain kind of goes into this survival 
20110108024110.000|20110108024113.000|TR0|mode.  And it all seemed kind of surreal.  
20110108024113.000|20110108024115.000|TR0|And we just sort of stayed calm and, you 
20110108024115.000|20110108024117.000|TR0|know, it unfolded.
20110108024117.000|20110108024120.000|TR0|
20110108024120.000|20110108024122.000|TR0|And I kept thinking we would be 
20110108024122.000|20110108024124.000|TR0|recaptured.  I kept thinking something 
20110108024124.000|20110108024126.000|TR0|would go wrong.  And it worked.  It was an 
20110108024126.000|20110108024129.000|TR0|ending I never thought would occur in our 
20110108024129.000|20110108024131.000|TR0|captivity.
20110108024131.000|20110108024133.000|TR0|
20110108024133.000|20110108024136.000|TR0|COOPER:  It's an incredible story.  The 
20110108024136.000|20110108024138.000|TR0|book, again, is "A Rope and A Prayer."  
20110108024138.000|20110108024140.000|TR0|David Rhode, I appreciate your time.
20110108024140.000|20110108024143.000|TR0|
20110108024143.000|20110108024145.000|TR0|RHODE:  Thank you.
20110108024145.000|20110108024147.000|TR0|
20110108024147.000|20110108024149.000|TR0|COOPER:  Up next, lost and found, a 
20110108024149.000|20110108024152.000|TR0|teenager stuck on a mountain in 
20110108024152.000|20110108024154.000|TR0|temperatures dropping 17 degrees below 
20110108024154.000|20110108024156.000|TR0|zero.  How he used tips he learned from 
20110108024156.000|20110108024159.000|TR0|watching Bear Grylls on TV to stay alive.
20110108024159.000|20110108024201.000|TR0|
20110108024201.000|20110108024203.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110108024203.000|20110108024206.000|TR0|
20110108024206.000|20110108024208.000|TR0|COOPER:  If you were lost on a mountain 
20110108024208.000|20110108024210.000|TR0|just as the sun was going down, with 
20110108024210.000|20110108024213.000|TR0|temperatures plummeting to 17 below zero, 
20110108024213.000|20110108024215.000|TR0|would you know how to survive?  Jake 
20110108024215.000|20110108024217.000|TR0|Denham knows how.  He escaped those grim 
20110108024217.000|20110108024219.000|TR0|conditions in Oregon on a ski trip last 
20110108024219.000|20110108024222.000|TR0|winter.  The teenager credits Bear Grylls 
20110108024222.000|20110108024224.000|TR0|for giving him the skills to get out alive.
20110108024224.000|20110108024226.000|TR0|
20110108024226.000|20110108024229.000|TR0|Jake, how did you get your separated from 
20110108024229.000|20110108024231.000|TR0|your mom on the ski trip?
20110108024231.000|20110108024233.000|TR0|
20110108024233.000|20110108024236.000|TR0|JAKE DENHAM, SURVIVED ON FREEZING 
20110108024236.000|20110108024238.000|TR0|MOUNTAIN:  Well, I had just finished lunch 
20110108024238.000|20110108024240.000|TR0|at the top of the hill -- I mean, like the 
20110108024240.000|20110108024242.000|TR0|top of the mountain, where there was -- 
20110108024242.000|20110108024245.000|TR0|like, the ski lift went up to a place 
20110108024245.000|20110108024247.000|TR0|where you could have lunch.  And we were 
20110108024247.000|20110108024249.000|TR0|skiing down from the mountain on -- I 
20110108024249.000|20110108024252.000|TR0|forget which lift but -- I mean, which 
20110108024252.000|20110108024254.000|TR0|slope.
20110108024254.000|20110108024256.000|TR0|
20110108024256.000|20110108024259.000|TR0|And I got lost because my skis were too 
20110108024259.000|20110108024301.000|TR0|long and I kept tripping over myself.  And 
20110108024301.000|20110108024303.000|TR0|they kept going in the X.  And then I got 
20110108024303.000|20110108024306.000|TR0|more tired and more tired.  And I kept 
20110108024306.000|20110108024308.000|TR0|trying to get up and I couldn't.
20110108024308.000|20110108024310.000|TR0|
20110108024310.000|20110108024312.000|TR0|COOPER:  So when you -- when you first 
20110108024312.000|20110108024315.000|TR0|realized you were lost, what went through 
20110108024315.000|20110108024317.000|TR0|your mind?  DENHAM:  I might never see my 
20110108024317.000|20110108024319.000|TR0|family again.  But the thing that went 
20110108024319.000|20110108024322.000|TR0|through my mind was if you try, you can 
20110108024322.000|20110108024324.000|TR0|accomplish.  And I wanted to see my family 
20110108024324.000|20110108024326.000|TR0|and friends, my teachers, cat and dogs, 
20110108024326.000|20110108024329.000|TR0|and kind of collect rare coins and see my 
20110108024329.000|20110108024331.000|TR0|big brother.
20110108024331.000|20110108024333.000|TR0|
20110108024333.000|20110108024335.000|TR0|COOPER:  And then what happened?
20110108024335.000|20110108024338.000|TR0|
20110108024338.000|20110108024340.000|TR0|DENHAM:  And then I got down into the 
20110108024340.000|20110108024342.000|TR0|trees more and more.  And I knew I was 
20110108024342.000|20110108024345.000|TR0|going kind of downwards.  But the trick 
20110108024345.000|20110108024347.000|TR0|was I found some ski and snowboard trails 
20110108024347.000|20110108024349.000|TR0|and I followed those.  But -- and I 
20110108024349.000|20110108024352.000|TR0|followed those and then when it started 
20110108024352.000|20110108024354.000|TR0|getting dark, I built like a half -- like 
20110108024354.000|20110108024356.000|TR0|a half tube.  That's like this big.  And I 
20110108024356.000|20110108024359.000|TR0|built it like from like -- like it was 
20110108024359.000|20110108024401.000|TR0|this big and then cut it in half and this 
20110108024401.000|20110108024403.000|TR0|long so then --
20110108024403.000|20110108024405.000|TR0|
20110108024405.000|20110108024408.000|TR0|COOPER:  And you built that out of snow?
20110108024408.000|20110108024410.000|TR0|
20110108024410.000|20110108024412.000|TR0|DENHAM:  Yeah.
20110108024412.000|20110108024415.000|TR0|
20110108024415.000|20110108024417.000|TR0|COOPER:  How did you know how to do that?
20110108024417.000|20110108024419.000|TR0|
20110108024419.000|20110108024422.000|TR0|DENHAM:  I just thought of it because I 
20110108024422.000|20110108024424.000|TR0|knew -- I know how to make houses ever 
20110108024424.000|20110108024426.000|TR0|since I was little.  And I love building 
20110108024426.000|20110108024429.000|TR0|stuff and nailing nails with wood.  So I 
20110108024429.000|20110108024431.000|TR0|learned it from some from Bear Grylls.  So 
20110108024431.000|20110108024433.000|TR0|--
20110108024433.000|20110108024435.000|TR0|
20110108024435.000|20110108024438.000|TR0|COOPER:  You watched -- what, you watched 
20110108024438.000|20110108024440.000|TR0|his show?  You had seen him do stuff like 
20110108024440.000|20110108024442.000|TR0|that?
20110108024442.000|20110108024445.000|TR0|
20110108024445.000|20110108024447.000|TR0|DENHAM:  For over five years.
20110108024447.000|20110108024449.000|TR0|
20110108024449.000|20110108024452.000|TR0|COOPER:  Oh, wow.  You have been watching 
20110108024452.000|20110108024454.000|TR0|his show over five years?
20110108024454.000|20110108024456.000|TR0|
20110108024456.000|20110108024458.000|TR0|DENHAM:  Yes.
20110108024458.000|20110108024501.000|TR0|
20110108024501.000|20110108024503.000|TR0|COOPER:  So you build basically like a 
20110108024503.000|20110108024505.000|TR0|small snow cave, like a little tunnel, 
20110108024505.000|20110108024508.000|TR0|right?
20110108024508.000|20110108024510.000|TR0|
20110108024510.000|20110108024512.000|TR0|DENHAM:  Uh-huh.
20110108024512.000|20110108024515.000|TR0|
20110108024515.000|20110108024517.000|TR0|COOPER:  What was that -- how much time 
20110108024517.000|20110108024519.000|TR0|did you spend in there?  All night in 
20110108024519.000|20110108024522.000|TR0|there?
20110108024522.000|20110108024524.000|TR0|
20110108024524.000|20110108024526.000|TR0|DENHAM:  I spent about seven hours.
20110108024526.000|20110108024528.000|TR0|
20110108024528.000|20110108024531.000|TR0|COOPER:  What was that like?
20110108024531.000|20110108024533.000|TR0|
20110108024533.000|20110108024535.000|TR0|DENHAM:  And then -- very cold.  I got 
20110108024535.000|20110108024538.000|TR0|frostbite first degree.  And most of all 
20110108024538.000|20110108024540.000|TR0|was that if you stay in motion, then you 
20110108024540.000|20110108024542.000|TR0|can -- when you're cold, then you won't 
20110108024542.000|20110108024545.000|TR0|get frostbite.  And another thing that is 
20110108024545.000|20110108024547.000|TR0|the most thing most thing -- most best 
20110108024547.000|20110108024549.000|TR0|thing to tell people is never eat snow, 
20110108024549.000|20110108024551.000|TR0|because it will lower your body 
20110108024551.000|20110108024554.000|TR0|temperature very fast.
20110108024554.000|20110108024556.000|TR0|
20110108024556.000|20110108024558.000|TR0|COOPER:  Really?  I didn't know that.
20110108024558.000|20110108024601.000|TR0|
20110108024601.000|20110108024603.000|TR0|DENHAM:  Yeah.
20110108024603.000|20110108024605.000|TR0|
20110108024605.000|20110108024608.000|TR0|COOPER:  So let me bring in Bear.  Bear, 
20110108024608.000|20110108024610.000|TR0|you clearly have an avid fan here.  He's 
20110108024610.000|20110108024612.000|TR0|been watching you for many years and 
20110108024612.000|20110108024615.000|TR0|actually used some of your snow building 
20110108024615.000|20110108024617.000|TR0|techniques or cave building techniques.
20110108024617.000|20110108024619.000|TR0|
20110108024619.000|20110108024621.000|TR0|GRYLLS:  Jake, it is amazing to -- amazing 
20110108024621.000|20110108024624.000|TR0|to hear your story.  And I'm so pleased to 
20110108024624.000|20110108024626.000|TR0|hear that you're alive and well.  And 
20110108024626.000|20110108024628.000|TR0|you've shown such heart, such courage.
20110108024628.000|20110108024631.000|TR0|
20110108024631.000|20110108024633.000|TR0|But you're right.  You know, a snow cave 
20110108024633.000|20110108024635.000|TR0|will get you out of the weather.  And it's 
20110108024635.000|20110108024638.000|TR0|the weather and the wind that will kill 
20110108024638.000|20110108024640.000|TR0|very quickly.  But then it just becomes 
20110108024640.000|20110108024642.000|TR0|this endurance exercise of seeing the 
20110108024642.000|20110108024644.000|TR0|night through.  And Jake's right when he 
20110108024644.000|20110108024647.000|TR0|says movement what keeps you warm.  And 
20110108024647.000|20110108024649.000|TR0|it's that horrible, horrible thing of 
20110108024649.000|20110108024651.000|TR0|knowing that if you stop and you fall 
20110108024651.000|20110108024654.000|TR0|asleep, you're just going to get horrific 
20110108024654.000|20110108024656.000|TR0|frostbite.
20110108024656.000|20110108024658.000|TR0|
20110108024658.000|20110108024701.000|TR0|You have to keep this discipline, keeping 
20110108024701.000|20110108024703.000|TR0|your fingers and your toes moving.  And it 
20110108024703.000|20110108024705.000|TR0|becomes such hard work.  But it's that 
20110108024705.000|20110108024708.000|TR0|that will keep the blood in the 
20110108024708.000|20110108024710.000|TR0|extremities and will keep the feeling and 
20110108024710.000|20110108024712.000|TR0|keep the limbs in one piece.

20110108024714.000|20110108024717.000|TR0|And it really is -- Jake, as you know, it 
20110108024717.000|20110108024719.000|TR0|becomes a battle in your mind, isn't it?  
20110108024719.000|20110108024721.000|TR0|That's really where the battle of survival 
20110108024721.000|20110108024724.000|TR0|is won or lost, in your heart and in your 
20110108024724.000|20110108024726.000|TR0|mind, whether you can keep that 
20110108024726.000|20110108024728.000|TR0|discipline, keep the fingers and toes 
20110108024728.000|20110108024731.000|TR0|wiggling until dawn arrives, and then get 
20110108024731.000|20110108024733.000|TR0|moving again.

20110108024735.000|20110108024737.000|TR0|Word on you, buddy.  You joined an amazing 
20110108024737.000|20110108024740.000|TR0|club of people who have had to dig very 
20110108024740.000|20110108024742.000|TR0|deep.  And I really admire you.
20110108024742.000|20110108024744.000|TR0|
20110108024744.000|20110108024747.000|TR0|DENHAM:  Thank you very much.
20110108024747.000|20110108024749.000|TR0|
20110108024749.000|20110108024751.000|TR0|COOPER:  When you finally got home, when 
20110108024751.000|20110108024754.000|TR0|you saw that you were going to be OK, once 
20110108024754.000|20110108024756.000|TR0|the morning came and you were able to walk 
20110108024756.000|20110108024758.000|TR0|out the rest of the way, what was that 
20110108024758.000|20110108024801.000|TR0|feeling like?
20110108024801.000|20110108024803.000|TR0|
20110108024803.000|20110108024805.000|TR0|DENHAM:  Actually, you might be mistaken, 
20110108024805.000|20110108024807.000|TR0|but it wasn't in the morning.  It was -- 
20110108024807.000|20110108024810.000|TR0|when I walked out it was about 11:50.
20110108024810.000|20110108024812.000|TR0|
20110108024812.000|20110108024814.000|TR0|COOPER:  OK.
20110108024814.000|20110108024817.000|TR0|
20110108024817.000|20110108024819.000|TR0|DENHAM:  And it was totally dark.  I 
20110108024819.000|20110108024821.000|TR0|couldn't see.  But the trick I knew was 
20110108024821.000|20110108024824.000|TR0|that I followed the skis and snowboard 
20110108024824.000|20110108024826.000|TR0|trails.  So I followed them to snowmobile 
20110108024826.000|20110108024828.000|TR0|tracks and I knew that was packed down so 
20110108024828.000|20110108024831.000|TR0|much that I could walk on it.  And I 
20110108024831.000|20110108024833.000|TR0|walked on that.
20110108024833.000|20110108024835.000|TR0|
20110108024835.000|20110108024837.000|TR0|But the trick was how I knew it -- I know 
20110108024837.000|20110108024840.000|TR0|because I had a friend that has a 
20110108024840.000|20110108024842.000|TR0|snowmobile.  And you can see the ridges.  
20110108024842.000|20110108024844.000|TR0|And I felt the ridges with my hands.  And 
20110108024844.000|20110108024847.000|TR0|that's how I knew.  So I walked on that.  
20110108024847.000|20110108024849.000|TR0|And then when I kept getting in the deeper 
20110108024849.000|20110108024851.000|TR0|snow, I'd get back down on my hands and 
20110108024851.000|20110108024854.000|TR0|knees and feel again.
20110108024854.000|20110108024856.000|TR0|
20110108024856.000|20110108024858.000|TR0|And that's how I found out how to get down.
20110108024858.000|20110108024900.000|TR0|
20110108024900.000|20110108024903.000|TR0|COOPER:  And Jake you would like -- you'd 
20110108024903.000|20110108024905.000|TR0|like one day, Jake, to go on an adventure 
20110108024905.000|20110108024907.000|TR0|with Bear, right?

20110108024921.000|20110108024924.000|TR0|we're safe.

20110108024926.000|20110108024928.000|TR0|DENHAM:  OK.

20110108024930.000|20110108024933.000|TR0|COOPER:  That's cool.  Jake Denham, Bear

20110108025003.000|20110108025005.000|TR0|I recently sat down with Piers.  And we 
20110108025005.000|20110108025007.000|TR0|talked about all sorts of things, 
20110108025007.000|20110108025010.000|TR0|including how he got a big newspaper job 
20110108025010.000|20110108025012.000|TR0|in England at the age 28, but he also took 
20110108025012.000|20110108025014.000|TR0|exception to my choice of clothing.  Take 
20110108025014.000|20110108025017.000|TR0|a look.

20110108025053.000|20110108025056.000|TR0|COOPER:  I thought we were shooting at a 
20110108025056.000|20110108025058.000|TR0|desk, so I didn't think we were going to 
20110108025058.000|20110108025100.000|TR0|be seen, which is why I don't like being

20110108025112.000|20110108025114.000|TR0|three sayings.  Right?  She's got three

20110108025258.000|20110108025300.000|TR0|Murdoch made me editor of "the News of the 
20110108025300.000|20110108025302.000|TR0|World," his biggest selling newspaper in 
20110108025302.000|20110108025305.000|TR0|the world.
20110108025305.000|20110108025307.000|TR0|
20110108025307.000|20110108025309.000|TR0|COOPER:  I understand the job offer came 
20110108025309.000|20110108025312.000|TR0|after you guys were walking down the beach 
20110108025312.000|20110108025314.000|TR0|together?
20110108025314.000|20110108025316.000|TR0|
20110108025316.000|20110108025319.000|TR0|MORGAN:  It's completely surreal.
20110108025319.000|20110108025321.000|TR0|
20110108025321.000|20110108025323.000|TR0|COOPER:  For a couple hours?  What's that 
20110108025323.000|20110108025326.000|TR0|like to just stroll down the beach with 
20110108025326.000|20110108025328.000|TR0|Rupert Murdoch?
20110108025328.000|20110108025330.000|TR0|
20110108025330.000|20110108025332.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I'll tell you.  I was editing the 
20110108025332.000|20110108025335.000|TR0|pop column, the show biz column in "The 
20110108025335.000|20110108025337.000|TR0|Sun," his big selling London tabloid.  I 
20110108025337.000|20110108025339.000|TR0|got a call, Rupert Murdoch wants to see 
20110108025339.000|20110108025342.000|TR0|you tomorrow.  OK, great.  Where?  Miami. 
20110108025342.000|20110108025344.000|TR0|You're on a plane now.
20110108025344.000|20110108025346.000|TR0|
20110108025346.000|20110108025349.000|TR0|So I go to the airport, road, fly to 
20110108025349.000|20110108025351.000|TR0|Miami.  And I meet Rupert Murdoch.  He 
20110108025351.000|20110108025353.000|TR0|says, let goes to the beach.  Miami Beach. 
20110108025353.000|20110108025355.000|TR0| So we go to the beach, and I'm with the 
20110108025355.000|20110108025358.000|TR0|world's most powerful media tycoon.  We 
20110108025358.000|20110108025400.000|TR0|take our shoes and socks off.  And we 
20110108025400.000|20110108025402.000|TR0|walked up and down Miami Beach in the surf 
20110108025402.000|20110108025405.000|TR0|for a couple of hours.
20110108025405.000|20110108025407.000|TR0|
20110108025407.000|20110108025409.000|TR0|We talk about life and the universe.  At 
20110108025409.000|20110108025412.000|TR0|several stages, I'm thinking, what the 
20110108025412.000|20110108025414.000|TR0|hell is happening here?  Why am I here?  
20110108025414.000|20110108025416.000|TR0|Why is he doing this?  And it was a 
20110108025416.000|20110108025419.000|TR0|surreal moment when somebody came up -- 
20110108025419.000|20110108025421.000|TR0|and I used to have my picture in the paper 
20110108025421.000|20110108025423.000|TR0|a few times doing the pop column of 
20110108025423.000|20110108025425.000|TR0|various pop stars, and actually said, "all 
20110108025425.000|20110108025428.000|TR0|right, Piers, mate, how are you?  Who are 
20110108025428.000|20110108025430.000|TR0|you with?"
20110108025430.000|20110108025432.000|TR0|
20110108025432.000|20110108025435.000|TR0|Who am I with?
20110108025435.000|20110108025437.000|TR0|
20110108025437.000|20110108025439.000|TR0|COOPER:  He paid somebody to do that.
20110108025439.000|20110108025442.000|TR0|
20110108025442.000|20110108025444.000|TR0|MORGAN:  It looked like it.  I think 
20110108025444.000|20110108025446.000|TR0|Murdoch's got a rat.  Family members?  
20110108025446.000|20110108025448.000|TR0|What's going on here.  But it was surreal. 
20110108025448.000|20110108025451.000|TR0| At the end of it, we went to a party for 
20110108025451.000|20110108025453.000|TR0|-- it was when he bought the NFL for Fox. 
20110108025453.000|20110108025455.000|TR0|And they were just having a big party for 
20110108025455.000|20110108025458.000|TR0|the affiliates of Fox.  And he introduced 
20110108025458.000|20110108025500.000|TR0|me to a guy called Dave Hill on Fox 
20110108025500.000|20110108025502.000|TR0|Sports, very legendary TV guy, with the 
20110108025502.000|20110108025505.000|TR0|immortal words, "this is Piers Morgan, my 
20110108025505.000|20110108025507.000|TR0|friend from London, and he's the new 
20110108025507.000|20110108025509.000|TR0|editor of 'the News of the World.'"  That 
20110108025509.000|20110108025512.000|TR0|was the first time I knew what this was 
20110108025512.000|20110108025514.000|TR0|all about, was when he introduced me by my 
20110108025514.000|20110108025516.000|TR0|new title that I didn't know I'd had.  It 
20110108025516.000|20110108025518.000|TR0|was surreal.
20110108025518.000|20110108025521.000|TR0|
20110108025521.000|20110108025523.000|TR0|COOPER:  You've written eight books.
20110108025523.000|20110108025525.000|TR0|
20110108025525.000|20110108025528.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Yes.
20110108025528.000|20110108025530.000|TR0|
20110108025530.000|20110108025532.000|TR0|COOPER:  A number of them best sellers.
20110108025532.000|20110108025535.000|TR0|
20110108025535.000|20110108025537.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Some are pretty awful.  Got to be 
20110108025537.000|20110108025539.000|TR0|honest.
20110108025539.000|20110108025541.000|TR0|
20110108025541.000|20110108025544.000|TR0|COOPER:  Why?
20110108025544.000|20110108025546.000|TR0|
20110108025546.000|20110108025548.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Some are great.  "The Insider" is 
20110108025548.000|20110108025551.000|TR0|a great book.  And the last one, "God 
20110108025551.000|20110108025553.000|TR0|Bless America," is pretty good too.
20110108025553.000|20110108025555.000|TR0|
20110108025555.000|20110108025558.000|TR0|COOPER:  But your last book was about 
20110108025558.000|20110108025600.000|TR0|experiences in the United States.
20110108025600.000|20110108025602.000|TR0|
20110108025602.000|20110108025605.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Yes, it was a diary of my two 
20110108025605.000|20110108025607.000|TR0|years here during the process of your 
20110108025607.000|20110108025609.000|TR0|election, with the election of Barack 
20110108025609.000|20110108025611.000|TR0|Obama, which I -- as a Brit coming here 
20110108025611.000|20110108025614.000|TR0|for a few months of the year, watching his 
20110108025614.000|20110108025616.000|TR0|assent to power was quite an extraordinary 
20110108025616.000|20110108025618.000|TR0|story.  And I wanted to record it, and to 
20110108025618.000|20110108025621.000|TR0|record my genuine feelings it all unfolds.
20110108025621.000|20110108025623.000|TR0|
20110108025623.000|20110108025625.000|TR0|COOPER:  What do you think the biggest 
20110108025625.000|20110108025628.000|TR0|differences between America and the UK are?
20110108025628.000|20110108025630.000|TR0|
20110108025630.000|20110108025632.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I think that it's interesting.  
20110108025632.000|20110108025635.000|TR0|What I was saying earlier about the humor 
20110108025635.000|20110108025637.000|TR0|difference plays a different way as well.  
20110108025637.000|20110108025639.000|TR0|We might mock the Americans for not having 
20110108025639.000|20110108025641.000|TR0|the irony and sarcasm that we pride 
20110108025641.000|20110108025644.000|TR0|ourselves on.  But you don't have the 
20110108025644.000|20110108025646.000|TR0|cynicism as a country, either.
20110108025646.000|20110108025648.000|TR0|
20110108025648.000|20110108025651.000|TR0|I find Americans, they're just more 
20110108025651.000|20110108025653.000|TR0|positive.  And they're more accepting and 
20110108025653.000|20110108025655.000|TR0|encouraging of success.  Now your class 
20110108025655.000|20110108025658.000|TR0|system is not based around where you were 
20110108025658.000|20110108025700.000|TR0|born or what school you went to.  Your 
20110108025700.000|20110108025702.000|TR0|class system is based around achievement, 
20110108025702.000|20110108025704.000|TR0|hard work and success.
20110108025704.000|20110108025707.000|TR0|
20110108025707.000|20110108025709.000|TR0|COOPER:  And in England, that class system 
20110108025709.000|20110108025711.000|TR0|is still very prevalent, what family you 
20110108025711.000|20110108025714.000|TR0|were born into?
20110108025714.000|20110108025716.000|TR0|
20110108025716.000|20110108025718.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Very prevalent.  And also, 
20110108025718.000|20110108025721.000|TR0|there's a real cynicism which to a certain 
20110108025721.000|20110108025723.000|TR0|degree is quite healthy towards success.  
20110108025723.000|20110108025725.000|TR0|If you're successful in Britain and you 
20110108025725.000|20110108025728.000|TR0|buy a nice car -- you know, if I drive a 
20110108025728.000|20110108025730.000|TR0|nice car around London, you'll get people 
20110108025730.000|20110108025732.000|TR0|who will genuinely want to scratch it.  
20110108025732.000|20110108025734.000|TR0|And they'll want to spit on you.  And 
20110108025734.000|20110108025737.000|TR0|they'll want to feel envious and resentful.
20110108025737.000|20110108025739.000|TR0|
20110108025739.000|20110108025741.000|TR0|If you drive, as I did in the summer, an 
20110108025741.000|20110108025744.000|TR0|Aston Martin around Beverly Hills for 
20110108025744.000|20110108025746.000|TR0|three months, I had about four or five 
20110108025746.000|20110108025748.000|TR0|people on different occasions literally 
20110108025748.000|20110108025751.000|TR0|saying to me, hey, nice wheels.
20110108025751.000|20110108025753.000|TR0|
20110108025753.000|20110108025755.000|TR0|COOPER:  You rented an Aston Martin for 
20110108025755.000|20110108025757.000|TR0|three months?
20110108025757.000|20110108025800.000|TR0|
20110108025800.000|20110108025802.000|TR0|MORGAN:  They gave me one, actually.  
20110108025802.000|20110108025804.000|TR0|COOPER:  That's nice.  Wow.  I hope that 
20110108025804.000|20110108025807.000|TR0|wasn't CNN who gave you that.
20110108025807.000|20110108025809.000|TR0|
20110108025809.000|20110108025811.000|TR0|MORGAN:  It wasn't CNN.  No, definitely 
20110108025811.000|20110108025814.000|TR0|not.  Don't worry.  Relax.
20110108025814.000|20110108025816.000|TR0|
20110108025816.000|20110108025818.000|TR0|Currently most of the money goes your way. 
20110108025818.000|20110108025821.000|TR0| But we can soon change that, can't we?  I 
20110108025821.000|20110108025823.000|TR0|think Aston Martin saw me as the James 
20110108025823.000|20110108025825.000|TR0|Bond figure they've been looking for since 
20110108025825.000|20110108025827.000|TR0|the end of Sean Connery.
