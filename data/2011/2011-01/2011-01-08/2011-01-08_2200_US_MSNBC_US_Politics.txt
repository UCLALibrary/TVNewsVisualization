20110108222944.000|20110108222945.000|CC1|          I'm a coach.          
20110108222945.000|20110108222945.000|CC1|    But when I was diagnosed

20110108222948.000|20110108222949.000|CC1|        I needed a coach.

20110108222952.000|20110108222953.000|CC1|          I felt lost.

20110108224327.000|20110108224328.000|CC1|PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN        
20110108224328.000|20110108224332.000|CC1|SOMETHING THAT COULD BE CAUSED, 
20110108224332.000|20110108224335.000|CC1|IT NOT ONLY BY OPPORTUNISTIC

20110108224349.000|20110108224350.000|CC1|INTERESTINGLY, THIS FLIES RIGHT

20110108230317.000|20110108230319.000|CC1|UNABLE TO CONFIRM, IN FACT, HE  
20110108230319.000|20110108230321.000|CC1|HAD BEEN ACCEPTED INTO ONE OF   
20110108230321.000|20110108230323.000|CC1|THE MILITARY SERVICES.

20110108230325.000|20110108230328.000|CC1|FEDERAL LAWS AS TREASONOUS, AND 
20110108230328.000|20110108230330.000|CC1|ONE OF THE ODDEST, I GUESS YOU  
20110108230330.000|20110108230333.000|CC1|COULD SAY OF THE PAGES, IS A    
20110108230333.000|20110108230335.000|CC1|DISCUSSION OF HOW THE NUMBERING 
20110108230335.000|20110108230338.000|CC1|OF THE YEARS ISN'T ACCURATE.    
20110108230338.000|20110108230341.000|CC1|HE TALKS ABOUT THE SO-CALLED    
20110108230341.000|20110108230343.000|CC1|BEFORE THE COMMON ERA SYSTEM    
20110108230343.000|20110108230346.000|CC1|THAT, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE USED TO

20110108230356.000|20110108230358.000|CC1|I GUESS THE MAIN POINT HERE IS  
20110108230358.000|20110108230359.000|CC1|THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN IT THAT 
20110108230359.000|20110108230402.000|CC1|YOU WOULD CALL POLITICAL.

20110108230417.000|20110108230419.000|CC1|IT'S MUCH MORE ABSTRACT, AND    
20110108230419.000|20110108230420.000|CC1|IT'S VERY RAMBLING.
