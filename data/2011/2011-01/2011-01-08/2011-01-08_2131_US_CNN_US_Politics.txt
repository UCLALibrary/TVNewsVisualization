20110108213107.000|20110108213109.000|TR0|MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR:  We know that 
20110108213109.000|20110108213112.000|TR0|Congress was facing a very difficult year. 
20110108213112.000|20110108213115.000|TR0| There had been substantial changes in the 
20110108213115.000|20110108213117.000|TR0|House.  And there has been a lot of tough 
20110108213117.000|20110108213120.000|TR0|talk on both sides.  Do you think this 
20110108213120.000|20110108213123.000|TR0|will have any impact on all of that?
20110108213123.000|20110108213126.000|TR0|
20110108213126.000|20110108213128.000|TR0|PINGREE:  Well, I certainly hope it gives 
20110108213128.000|20110108213131.000|TR0|people pause, both within Congress, and 
20110108213131.000|20110108213134.000|TR0|outside, about toning down the rhetoric, 
20110108213134.000|20110108213136.000|TR0|thinking about the language we use with 
20110108213136.000|20110108213139.000|TR0|each other, about how to -- as one of my 
20110108213139.000|20110108213142.000|TR0|colleagues, a Republican colleague, said 
20110108213142.000|20110108213145.000|TR0|earlier today, how to disagree without 
20110108213145.000|20110108213147.000|TR0|being disagreeable.  And I think, 
20110108213147.000|20110108213150.000|TR0|particularly, those people on the outside, 
20110108213150.000|20110108213153.000|TR0|whether it is radio talk shows, or Web 
20110108213153.000|20110108213155.000|TR0|sites, you know, on the left and the 
20110108213155.000|20110108213158.000|TR0|right, just thinking about words have 
20110108213158.000|20110108213201.000|TR0|meaning.  They can incite anger and bad 
20110108213201.000|20110108213204.000|TR0|behavior.  I feel convinced this was the 
20110108213204.000|20110108213206.000|TR0|act of a crazy person who, you know, 
20110108213206.000|20110108213209.000|TR0|should be punished.  But the fact is, I 
20110108213209.000|20110108213212.000|TR0|think we face increasing anger levels that 
20110108213212.000|20110108213215.000|TR0|many of us feel at times in the capital, 
20110108213215.000|20110108213217.000|TR0|with people who are outside, with 
20110108213217.000|20110108213220.000|TR0|protestors, and others.  You know, I'm 
20110108213220.000|20110108213223.000|TR0|afraid this will bring about a very 
20110108213223.000|20110108213225.000|TR0|serious review about the security level of 
20110108213225.000|20110108213228.000|TR0|members when they're in public.  And 
20110108213228.000|20110108213231.000|TR0|that's just, you know, not what we want to 
20110108213231.000|20110108213234.000|TR0|have happen in a free and open democratic 
20110108213234.000|20110108213236.000|TR0|society.
20110108213236.000|20110108213239.000|TR0|
20110108213239.000|20110108213242.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  Representative Chellie Pingree, 
20110108213242.000|20110108213244.000|TR0|thank you very much for joining us.
20110108213244.000|20110108213247.000|TR0|
20110108213247.000|20110108213250.000|TR0|She is a representative from Maine.  And 
20110108213250.000|20110108213253.000|TR0|talking about Congresswoman Giffords and 
20110108213253.000|20110108213255.000|TR0|talking about possible security changes as 
20110108213255.000|20110108213258.000|TR0|a result of the shooting that's taken 
20110108213258.000|20110108213301.000|TR0|place.
20110108213301.000|20110108213304.000|TR0|
20110108213304.000|20110108213306.000|TR0|We want to remind you we are anticipating 
20110108213306.000|20110108213309.000|TR0|that president Obama is going to have a 
20110108213309.000|20110108213312.000|TR0|statement shortly.  We are standing by and 
20110108213312.000|20110108213314.000|TR0|of course, will bring that to you as soon 
20110108213314.000|20110108213317.000|TR0|as it happens.  We have already had a 
20110108213317.000|20110108213320.000|TR0|paper statement but we are expecting the 
20110108213320.000|20110108213323.000|TR0|president himself.
20110108213323.000|20110108213325.000|TR0|
20110108213325.000|20110108213328.000|TR0|And then we are also expecting the 
20110108213328.000|20110108213331.000|TR0|governor of Arizona to speak out. And 
20110108213331.000|20110108213333.000|TR0|that's the other location that you can see 
20110108213333.000|20110108213336.000|TR0|there, where we are anticipating to hear 
20110108213336.000|20110108213339.000|TR0|what information he can bring to us about 
20110108213339.000|20110108213342.000|TR0|this shocking chain of events that has 
20110108213342.000|20110108213344.000|TR0|unfolded in the state of Arizona.
20110108213344.000|20110108213347.000|TR0|
20110108213347.000|20110108213350.000|TR0|If you don't know, it is a shooting that's 
20110108213350.000|20110108213353.000|TR0|happened at a grocery store.  It happened 
20110108213353.000|20110108213355.000|TR0|around 10:00 local time this morning, a 
20110108213355.000|20110108213358.000|TR0|little after noon our time.  Congresswoman 
20110108213358.000|20110108213401.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords was holding a "Congress 
20110108213401.000|20110108213403.000|TR0|On Your Corner", that is a gathering where 
20110108213403.000|20110108213406.000|TR0|you would meet with constituents.  Events 
20110108213406.000|20110108213409.000|TR0|like this are public and the public does 
20110108213409.000|20110108213412.000|TR0|know when and where the Congress person 
20110108213412.000|20110108213414.000|TR0|would be.  A shooting broke out, a suspect 
20110108213414.000|20110108213417.000|TR0|has taken into custody.  We have 18 people 
20110108213417.000|20110108213420.000|TR0|shot, six people dead.  And the 
20110108213420.000|20110108213422.000|TR0|Congresswoman as you have heard is 
20110108213422.000|20110108213425.000|TR0|fighting for her life with a bullet wound 
20110108213425.000|20110108213428.000|TR0|to the head.
20110108213428.000|20110108213431.000|TR0|
20110108213431.000|20110108213433.000|TR0|Kate Bolduan is joining us with more 
20110108213433.000|20110108213436.000|TR0|information on the suspect.
20110108213436.000|20110108213439.000|TR0|
20110108213439.000|20110108213442.000|TR0|Is that right, Kate?
20110108213442.000|20110108213444.000|TR0|
20110108213444.000|20110108213447.000|TR0|KATE BOLDUAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  
20110108213447.000|20110108213450.000|TR0|Absolutely.  I'm getting this information 
20110108213450.000|20110108213452.000|TR0|from my colleague, Homeland Security 
20110108213452.000|20110108213455.000|TR0|Correspondent Jeanne Meserve.  She's 
20110108213455.000|20110108213458.000|TR0|learned from a law enforcement official 
20110108213458.000|20110108213501.000|TR0|that the shooter, this law enforcement 
20110108213501.000|20110108213503.000|TR0|official has described this shooter, the 
20110108213503.000|20110108213506.000|TR0|suspect, as a white male, born in 1988.  
20110108213506.000|20110108213509.000|TR0|That would make him 22 or 23, depending on 
20110108213509.000|20110108213511.000|TR0|his birthday.  But we're at least now 
20110108213511.000|20110108213514.000|TR0|getting a few more details as the 
20110108213514.000|20110108213517.000|TR0|situation unfolds.  Again, this is coming 
20110108213517.000|20110108213520.000|TR0|from my colleague Jeanne Meserve, on a 
20110108213520.000|20110108213522.000|TR0|little bit of the identity that we are 
20110108213522.000|20110108213525.000|TR0|learning of the suspect that we have 
20110108213525.000|20110108213528.000|TR0|learned from the U.S. Capitol Police, that 
20110108213528.000|20110108213531.000|TR0|the suspect is in custody.  And from this 
20110108213531.000|20110108213533.000|TR0|source, a law enforcement official 
20110108213533.000|20110108213536.000|TR0|describes the shooter as a white male, 
20110108213536.000|20110108213539.000|TR0|born in 1988, making him 22 or 23 years 
20110108213539.000|20110108213541.000|TR0|old, likely 22.
20110108213541.000|20110108213544.000|TR0|
20110108213544.000|20110108213547.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  And do we know at all whether 
20110108213547.000|20110108213550.000|TR0|this is the only suspect that's being 
20110108213550.000|20110108213552.000|TR0|sought or in custody rather?
20110108213552.000|20110108213555.000|TR0|
20110108213555.000|20110108213558.000|TR0|BOLDUAN:  From the sources that -- from a 
20110108213558.000|20110108213600.000|TR0|lot of what we're hearing, it seems that 
20110108213600.000|20110108213603.000|TR0|no one is going there quite yet, Marty, 
20110108213603.000|20110108213606.000|TR0|but it seems like it's being described, 
20110108213606.000|20110108213609.000|TR0|quite often, that that is the only person 
20110108213609.000|20110108213611.000|TR0|they have in custody, that's the only 
20110108213611.000|20110108213614.000|TR0|person they're looking at, at the moment.  
20110108213614.000|20110108213617.000|TR0|Again, very squishy.  But what we were 
20110108213617.000|20110108213620.000|TR0|getting from that press conference, that 
20110108213620.000|20110108213622.000|TR0|you and I were both listening to, it 
20110108213622.000|20110108213625.000|TR0|sounds like they seem to indicate that it 
20110108213625.000|20110108213628.000|TR0|would be, as the way they're talking about 
20110108213628.000|20110108213630.000|TR0|and describing the situation, that they 
20110108213630.000|20110108213633.000|TR0|have the suspect in custody, rather than 
20110108213633.000|20110108213636.000|TR0|they're looking for more.  Again, of 
20110108213636.000|20110108213639.000|TR0|course we always caution a very fluid 
20110108213639.000|20110108213641.000|TR0|situation.
20110108213641.000|20110108213644.000|TR0|
20110108213644.000|20110108213647.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  Sure.  Kate Bolduan, thank you 
20110108213647.000|20110108213649.000|TR0|very much for that update on the suspect.
20110108213649.000|20110108213652.000|TR0|
20110108213652.000|20110108213655.000|TR0|Just going back to the University Medical 
20110108213655.000|20110108213658.000|TR0|Center in Tucson, Arizona, that is where 
20110108213658.000|20110108213700.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords has been taken, as 
20110108213700.000|20110108213703.000|TR0|have a number of other people.  We had a 
20110108213703.000|20110108213706.000|TR0|news conference that was held a short time 
20110108213706.000|20110108213709.000|TR0|ago.  We were told that they had 10 
20110108213709.000|20110108213711.000|TR0|patients.  One has died.  That was a 
20110108213711.000|20110108213714.000|TR0|9-month (sic)-old child.  And if we can, I 
20110108213714.000|20110108213717.000|TR0|would like to play for you again the sound 
20110108213717.000|20110108213719.000|TR0|bite that we have from the surgeon, who 
20110108213719.000|20110108213722.000|TR0|obviously had just come out of surgery.  
20110108213722.000|20110108213725.000|TR0|He had been working near Gabrielle 
20110108213725.000|20110108213728.000|TR0|Giffords' -- where she was being treated, 
20110108213728.000|20110108213730.000|TR0|and he had information regarding it and it 
20110108213730.000|20110108213733.000|TR0|was good news.  So let's listen.
20110108213733.000|20110108213736.000|TR0|
20110108213736.000|20110108213738.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110108213738.000|20110108213741.000|TR0|
20110108213741.000|20110108213744.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, the Congresswoman 
20110108213744.000|20110108213747.000|TR0|is not deceased.
20110108213747.000|20110108213749.000|TR0|
20110108213749.000|20110108213752.000|TR0|QUESTION:  Can you tell us her condition 
20110108213752.000|20110108213755.000|TR0|currently?
20110108213755.000|20110108213758.000|TR0|
20110108213758.000|20110108213800.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She's in critical 
20110108213800.000|20110108213803.000|TR0|condition.  She is-the neurosurgeons have 
20110108213803.000|20110108213806.000|TR0|finished operating on her.  And I can tell 
20110108213806.000|20110108213808.000|TR0|you at the current time period I'm very 
20110108213808.000|20110108213811.000|TR0|optimistic about recovery.

20110108213819.000|20110108213822.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  All right.  That's just what you 
20110108213822.000|20110108213825.000|TR0|heard coming from the surgeon that is at 
20110108213825.000|20110108213827.000|TR0|the hospital where a number of those who 
20110108213827.000|20110108213830.000|TR0|have been wounded have been treated.  
20110108213830.000|20110108213833.000|TR0|We're expecting more updates throughout 
20110108213833.000|20110108213836.000|TR0|this afternoon and into the evening.  
20110108213836.000|20110108213838.000|TR0|We'll take a break and come back with more 
20110108213838.000|20110108213841.000|TR0|in a moment.

20110108213844.000|20110108213847.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110108213847.000|20110108213849.000|TR0|
20110108213849.000|20110108213852.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  We are continuing to follow the 
20110108213852.000|20110108213855.000|TR0|breaking news coming out of Tucson, 
20110108213855.000|20110108213857.000|TR0|Arizona.  There has been a shooting that 
20110108213857.000|20110108213900.000|TR0|has taken place there, 18 people have been 
20110108213900.000|20110108213903.000|TR0|shot, six people have been killed.  Among 
20110108213903.000|20110108213906.000|TR0|those who were wounded is Congresswoman 
20110108213906.000|20110108213908.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.  She is currently in 
20110108213908.000|20110108213911.000|TR0|critical condition, undergoing treatment 
20110108213911.000|20110108213914.000|TR0|at the University Medical Center in 
20110108213914.000|20110108213916.000|TR0|Tucson, Arizona.
20110108213916.000|20110108213919.000|TR0|
20110108213919.000|20110108213922.000|TR0|Among those that have died, we understand, 
20110108213922.000|20110108213925.000|TR0|is also a child.  We are standing by at 
20110108213925.000|20110108213927.000|TR0|the White House where we anticipate that 
20110108213927.000|20110108213930.000|TR0|President Obama will be having a 
20110108213930.000|20110108213933.000|TR0|statement.  A paper statement has already 
20110108213933.000|20110108213936.000|TR0|been issued, but the president himself is 
20110108213936.000|20110108213938.000|TR0|going to give us some remarks.
20110108213938.000|20110108213941.000|TR0|
20110108213941.000|20110108213944.000|TR0|We also are standing by for the Arizona 
20110108213944.000|20110108213946.000|TR0|governor Jan Brewer, who is expected to 
20110108213946.000|20110108213949.000|TR0|have a statement.  In the meantime, let's 
20110108213949.000|20110108213952.000|TR0|go to Ed Henry.  Ed, we still don't know 
20110108213952.000|20110108213955.000|TR0|exactly the motivation for the attacker 
20110108213955.000|20110108213957.000|TR0|here. But it has to go through many 
20110108213957.000|20110108214000.000|TR0|people's minds that we knew we were 
20110108214000.000|20110108214003.000|TR0|heading into a contentious year in 
20110108214003.000|20110108214005.000|TR0|Congress.  I'm wondering do you think the 
20110108214005.000|20110108214008.000|TR0|president will address that in any way?
20110108214008.000|20110108214011.000|TR0|
20110108214011.000|20110108214014.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE 
20110108214014.000|20110108214016.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  That is the big question.  
20110108214016.000|20110108214019.000|TR0|I would expect he would, but we just don't 
20110108214019.000|20110108214022.000|TR0|know until we hear from him.  Obviously, 
20110108214022.000|20110108214025.000|TR0|the current political climate is hanging 
20110108214025.000|20110108214027.000|TR0|over this entire tragedy, but you are 
20110108214027.000|20110108214030.000|TR0|right, no one wants to jump to 
20110108214030.000|20110108214033.000|TR0|conclusions, certainly as to whether this 
20110108214033.000|20110108214035.000|TR0|was politically motivated.
20110108214035.000|20110108214038.000|TR0|
20110108214038.000|20110108214041.000|TR0|But the fact of the matter is she is a 
20110108214041.000|20110108214044.000|TR0|Democratic Congresswoman.  She is in 
20110108214044.000|20110108214046.000|TR0|Arizona, as John King and others have been 
20110108214046.000|20110108214049.000|TR0|reporting earlier, there are a lot of 
20110108214049.000|20110108214052.000|TR0|volatile issues there, starting with 
20110108214052.000|20110108214054.000|TR0|immigration reform.  She was in the middle 
20110108214054.000|20110108214057.000|TR0|of the healthcare reform debate, which 
20110108214057.000|20110108214100.000|TR0|obviously has also been very volatile, as 
20110108214100.000|20110108214103.000|TR0|Dana was pointing out earlier.
20110108214103.000|20110108214105.000|TR0|
20110108214105.000|20110108214108.000|TR0|So that's hanging out there.  You think 
20110108214108.000|20110108214111.000|TR0|back to other tragedies in this country, 
20110108214111.000|20110108214114.000|TR0|and I'm thinking personally about the 
20110108214114.000|20110108214116.000|TR0|Oklahoma City tragedy.  After those 1994 
20110108214116.000|20110108214119.000|TR0|elections and you remember then President 
20110108214119.000|20110108214122.000|TR0|Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City and 
20110108214122.000|20110108214124.000|TR0|gave a very powerful speech at the time 
20110108214124.000|20110108214127.000|TR0|that Democrats, Republicans, Independents, 
20110108214127.000|20110108214130.000|TR0|all said was very pivotal in trying to get 
20110108214130.000|20110108214133.000|TR0|the country to heal and move forward.
20110108214133.000|20110108214135.000|TR0|
20110108214135.000|20110108214138.000|TR0|Now, a lot more people died then 
20110108214138.000|20110108214141.000|TR0|obviously.  That was a big, big tragedy, 
20110108214141.000|20110108214143.000|TR0|but so is this one.  And it is still 
20110108214143.000|20110108214146.000|TR0|unfolding.  We don't know all the details. 
20110108214146.000|20110108214149.000|TR0| So this is a kind of moment where a 
20110108214149.000|20110108214152.000|TR0|president can walk out in the middle of 
20110108214152.000|20110108214154.000|TR0|not just this situation, on the ground in 
20110108214154.000|20110108214157.000|TR0|Arizona, but take a step back perhaps and 
20110108214157.000|20110108214200.000|TR0|talk about the broader political climate.
20110108214200.000|20110108214203.000|TR0|
20110108214203.000|20110108214205.000|TR0|Again, until he gets more facts, I would 
20110108214205.000|20110108214208.000|TR0|assume he's going to be very, very 
20110108214208.000|20110108214211.000|TR0|cautious about how far he's going out and 
20110108214211.000|20110108214213.000|TR0|talk about this.  This is mostly about 
20110108214213.000|20110108214216.000|TR0|addressing the American people, letting 
20110108214216.000|20110108214219.000|TR0|everyone know what the White House knows 
20110108214219.000|20110108214222.000|TR0|at this very moment.  But also perhaps 
20110108214222.000|20110108214224.000|TR0|trying to calm the situation down and 
20110108214224.000|20110108214227.000|TR0|reassure the American public right now, 
20110108214227.000|20110108214230.000|TR0|Marty.
20110108214230.000|20110108214232.000|TR0|
20110108214232.000|20110108214235.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  What's the activity you've seen 
20110108214235.000|20110108214238.000|TR0|there at the White House?
20110108214238.000|20110108214241.000|TR0|
20110108214241.000|20110108214243.000|TR0|HENRY:  Well, what I've seen is a lot of 
20110108214243.000|20110108214246.000|TR0|White House staffers being called back, to 
20110108214246.000|20110108214249.000|TR0|come in.  Many of them do work on 
20110108214249.000|20110108214252.000|TR0|Saturdays, I should point out, and 
20110108214252.000|20110108214254.000|TR0|weekends, just planning for the next 
20110108214254.000|20110108214257.000|TR0|legislative week next week, etc cetera.  
20110108214257.000|20110108214300.000|TR0|But I've seen a lot more come back who 
20110108214300.000|20110108214302.000|TR0|were not planning to work or had gone home 
20110108214302.000|20110108214305.000|TR0|after working this morning. They were 
20110108214305.000|20110108214308.000|TR0|coming back to help put together this 
20110108214308.000|20110108214311.000|TR0|statement the president will deliver in a 
20110108214311.000|20110108214313.000|TR0|few moments.  There's been a lot of 
20110108214313.000|20110108214316.000|TR0|activity there in terms of getting ready 
20110108214316.000|20110108214319.000|TR0|for this statement, but also more 
20110108214319.000|20110108214321.000|TR0|importantly collecting information from 
20110108214321.000|20110108214324.000|TR0|all the various law enforcement agencies 
20110108214324.000|20110108214327.000|TR0|from congressional officials.
20110108214327.000|20110108214330.000|TR0|
20110108214330.000|20110108214332.000|TR0|Very quickly, after this first started 
20110108214332.000|20110108214335.000|TR0|unfolding, I was talking to administration 
20110108214335.000|20110108214338.000|TR0|officials who said they were trying to 
20110108214338.000|20110108214341.000|TR0|gather just as much information as they 
20110108214341.000|20110108214343.000|TR0|could, and they were trying to get a 
20110108214343.000|20110108214346.000|TR0|handle on this situation to brief the 
20110108214346.000|20110108214349.000|TR0|president, brief other senior officials 
20110108214349.000|20110108214351.000|TR0|here.  Just so they could be as careful 
20110108214351.000|20110108214354.000|TR0|and cautious and yet stay on top of the 
20110108214354.000|20110108214357.000|TR0|situation, Marty.
20110108214357.000|20110108214400.000|TR0|
20110108214400.000|20110108214402.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  And I know that, of course, the 
20110108214402.000|20110108214405.000|TR0|sheriff's department out there is the lead 
20110108214405.000|20110108214408.000|TR0|investigator right now, but I presume the 
20110108214408.000|20110108214410.000|TR0|White House would say, look, whatever you 
20110108214410.000|20110108214413.000|TR0|need, whatever we can provide or help you 
20110108214413.000|20110108214416.000|TR0|with, you'll get, correct?
20110108214416.000|20110108214419.000|TR0|
20110108214419.000|20110108214421.000|TR0|HENRY:  Yes, as you heard local police, 
20110108214421.000|20110108214424.000|TR0|there at that news conference, referring 
20110108214424.000|20110108214427.000|TR0|to the FBI , other federal law enforcement 
20110108214427.000|20110108214429.000|TR0|agencies, the U.S. Capital Police, as Dana 
20110108214429.000|20110108214432.000|TR0|has been reporting, already involved in 
20110108214432.000|20110108214435.000|TR0|this investigation.  When you have a 
20110108214435.000|20110108214438.000|TR0|federal official like a congresswoman in 
20110108214438.000|20110108214440.000|TR0|this case, who has obviously been targeted 
20110108214440.000|20110108214443.000|TR0|in some way, Dana reported that her 
20110108214443.000|20110108214446.000|TR0|district director has sadly and tragically 
20110108214446.000|20110108214449.000|TR0|died.  Maybe there were other staffers who 
20110108214449.000|20110108214451.000|TR0|could have been shot as well.  Again, 
20110108214451.000|20110108214454.000|TR0|we're still trying to sort through that.
20110108214454.000|20110108214457.000|TR0|
20110108214457.000|20110108214459.000|TR0|Once you have federal officials who have 
20110108214459.000|20110108214502.000|TR0|been targeted, attacked, and some of whom 
20110108214502.000|20110108214505.000|TR0|appear to have died, certainly federal law 
20110108214505.000|20110108214508.000|TR0|enforcement is going to be involved.  And 
20110108214508.000|20110108214510.000|TR0|maybe local police may take the lead in 
20110108214510.000|20110108214513.000|TR0|actual police investigation, but there's 
20110108214513.000|20110108214516.000|TR0|no doubt, as was referred to in that news 
20110108214516.000|20110108214518.000|TR0|conference, that federal officials are not 
20110108214518.000|20110108214521.000|TR0|only on top of it, but are assisting and 
20110108214521.000|20110108214524.000|TR0|are involved in this investigation, as 
20110108214524.000|20110108214527.000|TR0|Dana reported, the U.S. Capital Police 
20110108214527.000|20110108214529.000|TR0|already, but the FBI was referred to 
20110108214529.000|20110108214532.000|TR0|earlier, as well.  The U.S. Homeland 
20110108214532.000|20110108214535.000|TR0|Security Department, Janet Napolitano put 
20110108214535.000|20110108214538.000|TR0|out a statement a short time ago, saying 
20110108214538.000|20110108214540.000|TR0|Homeland Security Department would also be 
20110108214540.000|20110108214543.000|TR0|helping, aiding, sending resources, any 
20110108214543.000|20110108214546.000|TR0|and all that they could to help in the 
20110108214546.000|20110108214548.000|TR0|situation.
20110108214548.000|20110108214551.000|TR0|
20110108214551.000|20110108214554.000|TR0|Part of what the White House and the Obama 
20110108214554.000|20110108214557.000|TR0|administration, writ large, is trying to 
20110108214557.000|20110108214559.000|TR0|do right now is obviously making sure that 
20110108214559.000|20110108214602.000|TR0|this is an isolated incident and making 
20110108214602.000|20110108214605.000|TR0|sure there are not other members of 
20110108214605.000|20110108214607.000|TR0|Congress being targeted, other officials 
20110108214607.000|20110108214610.000|TR0|being targeted and any other connection 
20110108214610.000|20110108214613.000|TR0|with this.  We heard those reports about a 
20110108214613.000|20110108214616.000|TR0|suspect being in custody, but very little 
20110108214616.000|20110108214618.000|TR0|information beyond that.  So they 
20110108214618.000|20110108214621.000|TR0|obviously want to make sure there are not 
20110108214621.000|20110108214624.000|TR0|other people at risk right now, Marty.

20110108214627.000|20110108214629.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  Ed Henry, of course, CNN 
20110108214629.000|20110108214632.000|TR0|covering the White House for us, standing 
20110108214632.000|20110108214635.000|TR0|by where we're waiting for President Obama 
20110108214635.000|20110108214637.000|TR0|to deliver a statement on camera regarding 
20110108214637.000|20110108214640.000|TR0|the events that happened.  There you see 
20110108214640.000|20110108214643.000|TR0|the camera location inside the White House.

20110108214646.000|20110108214648.000|TR0|We want to go back to the first moments 
20110108214648.000|20110108214651.000|TR0|after this tragedy began in Tucson, 
20110108214651.000|20110108214654.000|TR0|Arizona.  And to an interview I did with 
20110108214654.000|20110108214656.000|TR0|Jason Pekau, who was an eyewitness.  And 
20110108214656.000|20110108214659.000|TR0|here's how he described those first 
20110108214659.000|20110108214702.000|TR0|moments after he heard the gunfire.

20110108214713.000|20110108214716.000|TR0|SAFEWAY:  What I first heard, I heard 
20110108214716.000|20110108214718.000|TR0|about 15 to 20 gunshots in the parking 
20110108214718.000|20110108214721.000|TR0|lot.  I came outside immediately.  I did 
20110108214721.000|20110108214724.000|TR0|not see a vehicle or any people fleeing. I 
20110108214724.000|20110108214726.000|TR0|just saw people running, screaming towards 
20110108214726.000|20110108214729.000|TR0|the -- where the shooting happened.  
20110108214729.000|20110108214732.000|TR0|Everyone screaming that it was Gabrielle 
20110108214732.000|20110108214735.000|TR0|Giffords.  I did see them take her away on 
20110108214735.000|20110108214737.000|TR0|a stretch to the life flight.  She was 
20110108214737.000|20110108214740.000|TR0|moving from what I saw with my own eyes.  
20110108214740.000|20110108214743.000|TR0|And right now I just seen a bunch of 
20110108214743.000|20110108214745.000|TR0|people leaving on stretchers and life 
20110108214745.000|20110108214748.000|TR0|flights flying out of here at the moment.  
20110108214748.000|20110108214751.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  And imagine people there, 
20110108214751.000|20110108214754.000|TR0|including, perhaps yourself, are in a 
20110108214754.000|20110108214756.000|TR0|state of shock?
20110108214756.000|20110108214759.000|TR0|
20110108214759.000|20110108214802.000|TR0|PEKAU:  Yes.  From what I'm being told 
20110108214802.000|20110108214805.000|TR0|from people that had seen it, that she was 
20110108214805.000|20110108214807.000|TR0|shot point blank in the head by the 
20110108214807.000|20110108214810.000|TR0|shooter, and then after that, basically 
20110108214810.000|20110108214813.000|TR0|all chaos broke loose.  There was some 
20110108214813.000|20110108214815.000|TR0|bullets that went through the window into 
20110108214815.000|20110108214818.000|TR0|the Safeway, that I can see.  How many 
20110108214818.000|20110108214821.000|TR0|people were hurt, I have no idea.
20110108214821.000|20110108214824.000|TR0|
20110108214824.000|20110108214826.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  All right.  Stay with me.
20110108214826.000|20110108214829.000|TR0|
20110108214829.000|20110108214832.000|TR0|What Jason saw now leads us to the next 
20110108214832.000|20110108214834.000|TR0|part of the investigation and the

20110108214837.000|20110108214840.000|TR0|and wounded, and that takes us to the

20110108214843.000|20110108214845.000|TR0|Arizona, where a short while ago we got an 
20110108214845.000|20110108214848.000|TR0|update from a doctor who has been working 
20110108214848.000|20110108214851.000|TR0|on Congresswoman Giffords.  Here's what he 
20110108214851.000|20110108214854.000|TR0|described, and he was optimistic.

20110108214923.000|20110108214926.000|TR0|finished operating on her.  And I can tell

20110108214956.000|20110108214959.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110108214959.000|20110108215002.000|TR0|STATES:  A number of people were shot in 
20110108215002.000|20110108215004.000|TR0|Tucson, Arizona, including several who 
20110108215004.000|20110108215007.000|TR0|were meeting at a supermarket with their 
20110108215007.000|20110108215010.000|TR0|Congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords.  We are 
20110108215010.000|20110108215012.000|TR0|still assembling all the facts.  But we 
20110108215012.000|20110108215015.000|TR0|know that Representative Giffords was one 
20110108215015.000|20110108215018.000|TR0|of the victims.  She's currently at a 
20110108215018.000|20110108215021.000|TR0|hospital in the area and she's battling 
20110108215021.000|20110108215023.000|TR0|for her life.  We also know that at least 
20110108215023.000|20110108215026.000|TR0|five people lost their lives in this 
20110108215026.000|20110108215029.000|TR0|tragedy.

20110108215037.000|20110108215040.000|TR0|system for almost 40 years.  And a young 
20110108215040.000|20110108215042.000|TR0|girl, who was barely nine years old.
20110108215042.000|20110108215045.000|TR0|
20110108215045.000|20110108215048.000|TR0|I have spoken to Arizona Governor Jan 
20110108215048.000|20110108215051.000|TR0|Brewer, and offered the full resources of 
20110108215051.000|20110108215053.000|TR0|the federal government.  A suspect is 
20110108215053.000|20110108215056.000|TR0|currently in custody, but we don't yet 
20110108215056.000|20110108215059.000|TR0|know what provoked this unspeakable act.  
20110108215059.000|20110108215101.000|TR0|A comprehensive investigation is under 
20110108215101.000|20110108215104.000|TR0|way, and at my direction, Director Bob 
20110108215104.000|20110108215107.000|TR0|Mueller is en route to Arizona to help 
20110108215107.000|20110108215110.000|TR0|coordinate these efforts.

20110108215112.000|20110108215115.000|TR0|I've also spoken to the Democratic and 
20110108215115.000|20110108215118.000|TR0|Republican leaders in the House.  Gabby 
20110108215118.000|20110108215121.000|TR0|Giffords was a friend of mine.  She's not 
20110108215121.000|20110108215123.000|TR0|only an extraordinary public servant, but 
20110108215123.000|20110108215126.000|TR0|she's also somebody who is warm and 
20110108215126.000|20110108215129.000|TR0|caring.  She is well liked by her 
20110108215129.000|20110108215131.000|TR0|colleagues, and well liked by her 
20110108215131.000|20110108215134.000|TR0|constituents.  Her husband, Mark Kelly, is 
20110108215134.000|20110108215137.000|TR0|a navy captain, and one of America's 
20110108215137.000|20110108215140.000|TR0|valiant astronauts.
20110108215140.000|20110108215142.000|TR0|
20110108215142.000|20110108215145.000|TR0|It's not surprising that today Gabby was 
20110108215145.000|20110108215148.000|TR0|doing what she always does, listening to 
20110108215148.000|20110108215150.000|TR0|the hopes and concerns of her neighbors.  
20110108215150.000|20110108215153.000|TR0|That is the essence of what our democracy 
20110108215153.000|20110108215156.000|TR0|is all about.  That is why this is more 
20110108215156.000|20110108215159.000|TR0|than a tragedy for those involved.  It is 
20110108215159.000|20110108215201.000|TR0|a tragedy for Arizona, and a tragedy for 
20110108215201.000|20110108215204.000|TR0|our entire country.
20110108215204.000|20110108215207.000|TR0|
20110108215207.000|20110108215210.000|TR0|What Americans do at times of tragedy is 
20110108215210.000|20110108215212.000|TR0|to come together and support each other.  
20110108215212.000|20110108215215.000|TR0|So at this time I ask all Americans to 
20110108215215.000|20110108215218.000|TR0|join me and Michelle in keeping all the 
20110108215218.000|20110108215220.000|TR0|victims and their families, including 
20110108215220.000|20110108215223.000|TR0|Gabby, in our thoughts and prayers.  Those 
20110108215223.000|20110108215226.000|TR0|who have been injured we are rooting for 
20110108215226.000|20110108215229.000|TR0|them.  And I know Gabby is as tough as 
20110108215229.000|20110108215231.000|TR0|they come.  And I am hopeful that she's 
20110108215231.000|20110108215234.000|TR0|going to pull through.
20110108215234.000|20110108215237.000|TR0|
20110108215237.000|20110108215239.000|TR0|Obviously, our hearts go out to the family 
20110108215239.000|20110108215242.000|TR0|members of those who have been slain.  We 
20110108215242.000|20110108215245.000|TR0|are going to get to the bottom of this.  
20110108215245.000|20110108215248.000|TR0|And we're going to get through this.  But 
20110108215248.000|20110108215250.000|TR0|in the meantime, I think all of us need to 
20110108215250.000|20110108215253.000|TR0|make sure that with we're offering our 
20110108215253.000|20110108215256.000|TR0|thoughts and prayers to those concerned.  
20110108215256.000|20110108215259.000|TR0|Thank you.

20110108215328.000|20110108215331.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  Here at CNN we continue to 
20110108215331.000|20110108215334.000|TR0|follow the tragic events that have 
20110108215334.000|20110108215337.000|TR0|unfolded in Tucson, Arizona, beginning at 
20110108215337.000|20110108215339.000|TR0|10:00 o'clock in the morning there, local 
20110108215339.000|20110108215342.000|TR0|time, just after noon on the East Coast.
20110108215342.000|20110108215345.000|TR0|
20110108215345.000|20110108215348.000|TR0|Gunfire erupted at a shopping center 
20110108215348.000|20110108215350.000|TR0|outside of a grocery store. Congresswoman 
20110108215350.000|20110108215353.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords was holding a gathering 
20110108215353.000|20110108215356.000|TR0|there, what's known as "Congress On Your 
20110108215356.000|20110108215358.000|TR0|Corner".  It's a chance to meet with 
20110108215358.000|20110108215401.000|TR0|constituents.  She has been seriously 
20110108215401.000|20110108215404.000|TR0|wounded, and is undergoing surgery, or 
20110108215404.000|20110108215407.000|TR0|just come out of surgery from a gunshot 
20110108215407.000|20110108215409.000|TR0|wound to the head. According to the 
20110108215409.000|20110108215412.000|TR0|sheriff's office there 18 people were 
20110108215412.000|20110108215415.000|TR0|shot, six people have been killed, 
20110108215415.000|20110108215417.000|TR0|including a nine-year-old girl, and as we 
20110108215417.000|20110108215420.000|TR0|just heard -- I should say a 9-year-old 
20110108215420.000|20110108215423.000|TR0|child, excuse me.
20110108215423.000|20110108215426.000|TR0|
20110108215426.000|20110108215428.000|TR0|As we just heard from President Obama, in 
20110108215428.000|20110108215431.000|TR0|a statement that he delivered from the 
20110108215431.000|20110108215434.000|TR0|White House, among the dead, Judge John 
20110108215434.000|20110108215437.000|TR0|Roll. There has been reaction coming in 
20110108215437.000|20110108215439.000|TR0|all across the country.  Joining us right 
20110108215439.000|20110108215442.000|TR0|now, Jeff Rogers of the Pima County 
20110108215442.000|20110108215445.000|TR0|Democratic Party.
20110108215445.000|20110108215447.000|TR0|
20110108215447.000|20110108215450.000|TR0|Mr. Rogers, thank you for joining us on 
20110108215450.000|20110108215453.000|TR0|what is an extremely difficult day for 
20110108215453.000|20110108215456.000|TR0|your state, but for the nation.
20110108215456.000|20110108215458.000|TR0|
20110108215458.000|20110108215501.000|TR0|JEFF ROGERS, CHAIRMAN, PIMA COUNTY 
20110108215501.000|20110108215504.000|TR0|DEMOCRATIC PARTY:  You're welcome.
20110108215504.000|20110108215506.000|TR0|
20110108215506.000|20110108215509.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  Tell us where things stand right 
20110108215509.000|20110108215512.000|TR0|now as far as what you're hearing in the 
20110108215512.000|20110108215515.000|TR0|early stages of this investigation.  
20110108215515.000|20110108215517.000|TR0|ROGERS:  Well, we don't know anymore than 
20110108215517.000|20110108215520.000|TR0|you know.  We were gathered today for our 
20110108215520.000|20110108215523.000|TR0|bi-annual organization meeting to elect 
20110108215523.000|20110108215526.000|TR0|the officers that will lead the Democratic 
20110108215526.000|20110108215528.000|TR0|Party for the next two years.  At that 
20110108215528.000|20110108215531.000|TR0|meeting, we were expecting to hear from 
20110108215531.000|20110108215534.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords later in the day, 
20110108215534.000|20110108215536.000|TR0|to arrive to probably a cheering crowd, 
20110108215536.000|20110108215539.000|TR0|because of how beloved she is.
20110108215539.000|20110108215542.000|TR0|
20110108215542.000|20110108215545.000|TR0|And then we got the news.  So we 
20110108215545.000|20110108215547.000|TR0|immediately shortened the meeting and 
20110108215547.000|20110108215550.000|TR0|tried to wrap things up quickly try to 
20110108215550.000|20110108215553.000|TR0|find out what was happening with the 
20110108215553.000|20110108215555.000|TR0|Congresswoman.  And now all of her 
20110108215555.000|20110108215558.000|TR0|supporters have come down to the 
20110108215558.000|20110108215601.000|TR0|Democratic headquarters where we're 
20110108215601.000|20110108215604.000|TR0|watching CNN, as a matter of fact, and 
20110108215604.000|20110108215606.000|TR0|other sources, to just follow the story.
20110108215606.000|20110108215609.000|TR0|
20110108215609.000|20110108215612.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  I imagine that there was just a 
20110108215612.000|20110108215615.000|TR0|complete sense of shock that overtook all 
20110108215615.000|20110108215617.000|TR0|of you, given the fact that you were 
20110108215617.000|20110108215620.000|TR0|gathered, and you were expecting to hear 
20110108215620.000|20110108215623.000|TR0|from the congresswoman in a matter of 
20110108215623.000|20110108215625.000|TR0|hours.
20110108215625.000|20110108215628.000|TR0|
20110108215628.000|20110108215631.000|TR0|ROGERS:  Oh, yes.  It was stunning.  
20110108215631.000|20110108215634.000|TR0|People were crying.  We had pastors and 
20110108215634.000|20110108215636.000|TR0|priests and now we have the Red Cross in 
20110108215636.000|20110108215639.000|TR0|our headquarters to attend to people who 
20110108215639.000|20110108215642.000|TR0|are pretty upset.  Some of these people 
20110108215642.000|20110108215644.000|TR0|have known her since she was a baby and 
20110108215644.000|20110108215647.000|TR0|are close friends with her family and have 
20110108215647.000|20110108215650.000|TR0|spent the last six years working hard to 
20110108215650.000|20110108215653.000|TR0|elect her three separate times.
20110108215653.000|20110108215655.000|TR0|
20110108215655.000|20110108215658.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  And I'm just wondering, we know 
20110108215658.000|20110108215701.000|TR0|that Arizona has been going through a very 
20110108215701.000|20110108215703.000|TR0|contentious time.  I'm wondering the 
20110108215703.000|20110108215706.000|TR0|thoughts, of yourselves and others there 
20110108215706.000|20110108215709.000|TR0|who are gathered, as to whether this may 
20110108215709.000|20110108215712.000|TR0|have contributed to what has taken place.
20110108215712.000|20110108215714.000|TR0|
20110108215714.000|20110108215717.000|TR0|ROGERS:  Well, we don't know until we know 
20110108215717.000|20110108215720.000|TR0|more about the assailant, and whether 
20110108215720.000|20110108215723.000|TR0|others were involved, too.  But the level 
20110108215723.000|20110108215725.000|TR0|of rhetoric and the anger that's fomented 
20110108215725.000|20110108215728.000|TR0|out there by some has troubled us all.  I 
20110108215728.000|20110108215731.000|TR0|think we all need to take a step backward 
20110108215731.000|20110108215733.000|TR0|and have a more civilized discussion about 
20110108215733.000|20110108215736.000|TR0|the leadership and the politics of this 
20110108215736.000|20110108215739.000|TR0|nation, so that we can move forward and 
20110108215739.000|20110108215742.000|TR0|avoid these kinds of attacks.
20110108215742.000|20110108215744.000|TR0|
20110108215744.000|20110108215747.000|TR0|I think often times many people are guilty 
20110108215747.000|20110108215750.000|TR0|of ratcheting up the rhetoric to a point 
20110108215750.000|20110108215752.000|TR0|that sometimes people who are naturally 
20110108215752.000|20110108215755.000|TR0|somewhat unhinged take steps like this.  
20110108215755.000|20110108215758.000|TR0|And we all need to be very careful how we 
20110108215758.000|20110108215801.000|TR0|do that, and try to have a more civilized 
20110108215801.000|20110108215803.000|TR0|discussion.
20110108215803.000|20110108215806.000|TR0|
20110108215806.000|20110108215809.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  We also know the congresswoman 
20110108215809.000|20110108215812.000|TR0|just came through, survived a very 
20110108215812.000|20110108215814.000|TR0|contentious election, and campaign.  I'm 
20110108215814.000|20110108215817.000|TR0|wondering what exactly -- I had heard 
20110108215817.000|20110108215820.000|TR0|reports she had been threatened, and there 
20110108215820.000|20110108215822.000|TR0|were even gunshots fired at one of her 
20110108215822.000|20110108215825.000|TR0|offices?
20110108215825.000|20110108215828.000|TR0|
20110108215828.000|20110108215831.000|TR0|ROGERS:  Yes, prior to the election there 
20110108215831.000|20110108215833.000|TR0|were gunshots fired into her congressional 
20110108215833.000|20110108215836.000|TR0|office in Central Tucson and the front 
20110108215836.000|20110108215839.000|TR0|door window was shattered by gunshot fire.
20110108215839.000|20110108215841.000|TR0|
20110108215841.000|20110108215844.000|TR0|I think we-Congressman Grijalva has 
20110108215844.000|20110108215847.000|TR0|received more threats than Giffords down 
20110108215847.000|20110108215850.000|TR0|here, because of his very aggressive 
20110108215850.000|20110108215852.000|TR0|stance about the Senate bill 1070.  So I'm 
20110108215852.000|20110108215855.000|TR0|a little surprised to see that it is 
20110108215855.000|20110108215858.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords.  But I think we 
20110108215858.000|20110108215901.000|TR0|have to pause and wait and see what more 
20110108215901.000|20110108215903.000|TR0|facts turn up.  Because one of our 
20110108215903.000|20110108215906.000|TR0|long-serving federal judges, appointed by 
20110108215906.000|20110108215909.000|TR0|the first George Bush, did not survive 
20110108215909.000|20110108215911.000|TR0|this attack.  And he was quoted in the 
20110108215911.000|20110108215914.000|TR0|newspaper earlier in the week complaining 
20110108215914.000|20110108215917.000|TR0|about the caseloads down here, and how 
20110108215917.000|20110108215920.000|TR0|daunting it was on the judiciary.  And 
20110108215920.000|20110108215922.000|TR0|asking for an extension of time for 
20110108215922.000|20110108215925.000|TR0|trials.  It's my understanding that he and 
20110108215925.000|20110108215928.000|TR0|his family may have suffered some threats 
20110108215928.000|20110108215930.000|TR0|as a result of that.  He was a fine, fine 
20110108215930.000|20110108215933.000|TR0|judge, and not only was he the presiding 
20110108215933.000|20110108215936.000|TR0|judge of this district, but we all 
20110108215936.000|20110108215939.000|TR0|recognized him as being one of the finer 
20110108215939.000|20110108215941.000|TR0|judges around.
20110108215941.000|20110108215944.000|TR0|
20110108215944.000|20110108215947.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  All right.  Jeff Rogers, I have 
20110108215947.000|20110108215950.000|TR0|to interrupt and stop you there.  Thank 
20110108215950.000|20110108215952.000|TR0|you sp much.

20110108215955.000|20110108215958.000|TR0|ROGERS:  You're welcome.

20110108220000.000|20110108220003.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  And our hearts go out and we 
20110108220003.000|20110108220006.000|TR0|will keep very close watch on events 
20110108220006.000|20110108220009.000|TR0|coming out of Tucson.  We'll take a break

20110108220044.000|20110108220047.000|TR0|GOV. JAN BREWER, (R) ARIZONA:  Good 
20110108220047.000|20110108220049.000|TR0|afternoon.
20110108220049.000|20110108220052.000|TR0|
20110108220052.000|20110108220055.000|TR0|All of Arizona is shocked and deeply 
20110108220055.000|20110108220058.000|TR0|saddened by the horrific tragedy that 
20110108220058.000|20110108220100.000|TR0|transpired this morning in Tucson.  I have 
20110108220100.000|20110108220103.000|TR0|been in contact throughout the morning 
20110108220103.000|20110108220106.000|TR0|with law enforcement officials, as well as 
20110108220106.000|20110108220108.000|TR0|Mayor Walkup (ph), and just a short while 
20110108220108.000|20110108220111.000|TR0|ago with the president of the United 
20110108220111.000|20110108220114.000|TR0|States.
20110108220114.000|20110108220117.000|TR0|
20110108220117.000|20110108220119.000|TR0|The president conveyed his heartfelt 
20110108220119.000|20110108220122.000|TR0|sympathies for our state and shared 
20110108220122.000|20110108220125.000|TR0|determination to ensure that justice is 
20110108220125.000|20110108220128.000|TR0|fully served.
20110108220128.000|20110108220130.000|TR0|
20110108220130.000|20110108220133.000|TR0|I am just heart broken.  Gabby is more 
20110108220133.000|20110108220136.000|TR0|than just a colleague, she's actually a 
20110108220136.000|20110108220138.000|TR0|friend.  She's always been a noble public 
20110108220138.000|20110108220141.000|TR0|servant, and my thoughts and my prayers 
20110108220141.000|20110108220144.000|TR0|are with Congresswoman Giffords and her 
20110108220144.000|20110108220147.000|TR0|family, the congresswoman's staff and 
20110108220147.000|20110108220149.000|TR0|their families as well as other victims of 
20110108220149.000|20110108220152.000|TR0|this senseless and cruel violence.
20110108220152.000|20110108220155.000|TR0|
20110108220155.000|20110108220157.000|TR0|I've ordered the flags to be flown at half 
20110108220157.000|20110108220200.000|TR0|staff in honor of those who have lost 
20110108220200.000|20110108220203.000|TR0|their lives today.  It's an unbelievable 
20110108220203.000|20110108220206.000|TR0|tragedy that the people of Arizona 
20110108220206.000|20110108220208.000|TR0|experienced today.  One of which, of 
20110108220208.000|20110108220211.000|TR0|course, in our worst nightmares we would 
20110108220211.000|20110108220214.000|TR0|never could have imagined would have taken 
20110108220214.000|20110108220217.000|TR0|place.  I must tell you that a lot of 
20110108220217.000|20110108220219.000|TR0|information has been provided to all of 
20110108220219.000|20110108220222.000|TR0|you.  We are in constant contact with some 
20110108220222.000|20110108220225.000|TR0|officials and we will be kept abreast and 
20110108220225.000|20110108220227.000|TR0|we will do whatever it is that is 
20110108220227.000|20110108220230.000|TR0|necessary for us to do.  But I will say 
20110108220230.000|20110108220233.000|TR0|that I ask the people of Arizona, I ask 
20110108220233.000|20110108220236.000|TR0|the people of America to keep the victims 
20110108220236.000|20110108220238.000|TR0|and their families in their prayers and 
20110108220238.000|20110108220241.000|TR0|pray for their recovery and pray that we 
20110108220241.000|20110108220244.000|TR0|never again in Arizona have to ever 
20110108220244.000|20110108220246.000|TR0|experience a tragedy like this ever again. 
20110108220246.000|20110108220249.000|TR0| And I would be glad to...

20110108220252.000|20110108220255.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  Can you tell me 
20110108220255.000|20110108220257.000|TR0|more about your relationship, you called 
20110108220257.000|20110108220300.000|TR0|her a friend.  Can you tell about how far 
20110108220300.000|20110108220303.000|TR0|back you go and the last time you saw...

20110108220306.000|20110108220308.000|TR0|BREWER:  Gabby served in the Arizona State 
20110108220308.000|20110108220311.000|TR0|Senate when I was in the secretary of 
20110108220311.000|20110108220314.000|TR0|state's office, and grown to love her and 
20110108220314.000|20110108220316.000|TR0|respect her, and certainly as campaigning 
20110108220316.000|20110108220319.000|TR0|statewide, she campaigned in the southern 
20110108220319.000|20110108220322.000|TR0|part of Arizona.  I campaigned in the same 
20110108220322.000|20110108220325.000|TR0|areas but not only during the campaign 
20110108220325.000|20110108220327.000|TR0|effort, but certainly just going down and 
20110108220327.000|20110108220330.000|TR0|speaking to different groups like the Red 
20110108220330.000|20110108220333.000|TR0|Cross or Davis Marten (ph) Airport or 
20110108220333.000|20110108220335.000|TR0|library causes, Gabby  always showed up 
20110108220335.000|20110108220338.000|TR0|and we were always and often appearing 
20110108220338.000|20110108220341.000|TR0|together on the same stage.  And she was a 
20110108220341.000|20110108220344.000|TR0|genuine, nice, kind, hardworking servant 
20110108220344.000|20110108220346.000|TR0|for the people of district eight.  Always 
20110108220346.000|20110108220349.000|TR0|courteous to everyone.  She never really 
20110108220349.000|20110108220352.000|TR0|played partisan politics. She was serious 
20110108220352.000|20110108220355.000|TR0|about what she did and she was always 
20110108220355.000|20110108220357.000|TR0|concerned with what -- with what good of 
20110108220357.000|20110108220400.000|TR0|her district.  And so you have to admire 
20110108220400.000|20110108220403.000|TR0|someone like that.  She was a very 
20110108220403.000|20110108220405.000|TR0|gracious -- and is a very gracious elected 
20110108220405.000|20110108220408.000|TR0|public servant.

20110108220411.000|20110108220414.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  Governor, are you 
20110108220414.000|20110108220416.000|TR0|worried how this makes Arizona look?
20110108220416.000|20110108220419.000|TR0|
20110108220419.000|20110108220422.000|TR0|BREWER:  I think that it is something that 
20110108220422.000|20110108220424.000|TR0|certainly a state would not like to have 
20110108220424.000|20110108220427.000|TR0|happen in their state, or tragedies 
20110108220427.000|20110108220430.000|TR0|happen, and certainly we know that people 
20110108220430.000|20110108220433.000|TR0|should be held accountable and responsible 
20110108220433.000|20110108220435.000|TR0|for their actions.  This certainly doesn't 
20110108220435.000|20110108220438.000|TR0|show favor on the state of Arizona, but we 
20110108220438.000|20110108220441.000|TR0|have a lot of good, decent people here as 
20110108220441.000|20110108220444.000|TR0|this is one of those horrible tragedies 
20110108220444.000|20110108220446.000|TR0|that we face.  And we need to move on and 
20110108220446.000|20110108220449.000|TR0|make sure that those kinds of things don't 
20110108220449.000|20110108220452.000|TR0|happen.
20110108220452.000|20110108220454.000|TR0|
20110108220454.000|20110108220457.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  Governor, will 
20110108220457.000|20110108220500.000|TR0|this change how you meet with your 
20110108220500.000|20110108220503.000|TR0|constituents?
20110108220503.000|20110108220505.000|TR0|
20110108220505.000|20110108220508.000|TR0|BREWER:  It's interesting.  I've always 
20110108220508.000|20110108220511.000|TR0|been sort of the kind of person that 
20110108220511.000|20110108220513.000|TR0|always was with the people.  I had an 
20110108220513.000|20110108220516.000|TR0|incident when I served on the board of 
20110108220516.000|20110108220519.000|TR0|supervisors in Maricopa County when we had 
20110108220519.000|20110108220522.000|TR0|a shooting take place when one of our 
20110108220522.000|20110108220524.000|TR0|supervisors was shot.  And at that time, 
20110108220524.000|20110108220527.000|TR0|it was a realization that these things can 
20110108220527.000|20110108220530.000|TR0|happen.  That we have, for whatever the 
20110108220530.000|20110108220533.000|TR0|reasons, disturbed people in our 
20110108220533.000|20110108220535.000|TR0|communities that sometimes do...

20110108220538.000|20110108220541.000|TR0|DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  We apologize for 
20110108220541.000|20110108220543.000|TR0|that.  Obviously having some technical 
20110108220543.000|20110108220546.000|TR0|difficulties there is.  That was the 
20110108220546.000|20110108220549.000|TR0|governor of Arizona Jan Brewer talking 
20110108220549.000|20110108220552.000|TR0|about who she calls not only a co-worker,

20110108220602.000|20110108220605.000|TR0|that government ought to be open and 
20110108220605.000|20110108220608.000|TR0|people ought to be freely, will be able to 
20110108220608.000|20110108220611.000|TR0|access the facilities.  I think it's 
20110108220611.000|20110108220613.000|TR0|important, but I would assume under the 
20110108220613.000|20110108220616.000|TR0|circumstances that we've all seen today, 
20110108220616.000|20110108220619.000|TR0|the security in some manner probably will 
20110108220619.000|20110108220622.000|TR0|be increased.

20110108221259.000|20110108221302.000|TR0|say that they are optimistic, that's a 
20110108221302.000|20110108221304.000|TR0|good sign.
20110108221304.000|20110108221307.000|TR0|
20110108221307.000|20110108221310.000|TR0|SANJAY GUPTA, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: 
20110108221310.000|20110108221313.000|TR0| It's a very good sign. And listening 
20110108221313.000|20110108221315.000|TR0|closely to that press conference, Don, one 
20110108221315.000|20110108221318.000|TR0|of the things that really stuck out, they 
20110108221318.000|20110108221321.000|TR0|said that while she is in critical 
20110108221321.000|20110108221323.000|TR0|condition, she is following commands.  
20110108221323.000|20110108221326.000|TR0|That's such an important thing to note 
20110108221326.000|20110108221329.000|TR0|there, that someone is following commands, 
20110108221329.000|20110108221332.000|TR0|coming out of surgery, even though she may 
20110108221332.000|20110108221334.000|TR0|have a breathing tube in.  It means that 
20110108221334.000|20110108221337.000|TR0|she's able to hear what someone is saying, 
20110108221337.000|20110108221340.000|TR0|saying a command such as raise two 
20110108221340.000|20110108221342.000|TR0|fingers, for example.  She hears that, she 
20110108221342.000|20110108221345.000|TR0|processes that and she's able to execute 
20110108221345.000|20110108221348.000|TR0|some sort of function based on that. 
20110108221348.000|20110108221351.000|TR0|Raising two fingers means that several 
20110108221351.000|20110108221353.000|TR0|things in her brain are actually working 
20110108221353.000|20110108221356.000|TR0|very well.  So from a neurological 
20110108221356.000|20110108221359.000|TR0|perspective, that's something you really 
20110108221359.000|20110108221402.000|TR0|want to look for and the fact that she's 
20110108221402.000|20110108221404.000|TR0|able to do it is a very important and good 
20110108221404.000|20110108221407.000|TR0|sign, Don.
20110108221407.000|20110108221410.000|TR0|
20110108221410.000|20110108221412.000|TR0|LEMON:  Do you know anything about her 
20110108221412.000|20110108221415.000|TR0|health right now?  Apparently she is a 
20110108221415.000|20110108221418.000|TR0|healthy person, otherwise I know you're 
20110108221418.000|20110108221421.000|TR0|not her doctor.  But she would have to be, 
20110108221421.000|20110108221423.000|TR0|one would assume, in good health to 
20110108221423.000|20110108221426.000|TR0|undergo something like this and still be 
20110108221426.000|20110108221429.000|TR0|responsive.
20110108221429.000|20110108221431.000|TR0|
20110108221431.000|20110108221434.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, you know, I mean, we don't 
20110108221434.000|20110108221437.000|TR0|know a lot about the -- I don't know a lot 
20110108221437.000|20110108221440.000|TR0|about her previous health.  I think she's 
20110108221440.000|20110108221442.000|TR0|relatively a young person.  But, you know, 
20110108221442.000|20110108221445.000|TR0|the situation with a gunshot wound to the 
20110108221445.000|20110108221448.000|TR0|head and how serious it is, is dependent 
20110108221448.000|20110108221451.000|TR0|on a lot of things, obviously the type of 
20110108221451.000|20110108221453.000|TR0|munition that was used, the range which I 
20110108221453.000|20110108221456.000|TR0|know, I heard you described as close 
20110108221456.000|20110108221459.000|TR0|range, was this a glancing sort of shot, 
20110108221459.000|20110108221501.000|TR0|meaning, you know, did it sort of bounce 
20110108221501.000|20110108221504.000|TR0|sort of off the skull more than actually 
20110108221504.000|20110108221507.000|TR0|penetrate.  Those things are all 
20110108221507.000|20110108221510.000|TR0|important.  Which side of the head 
20110108221510.000|20110108221512.000|TR0|specifically, there are areas of the brain 
20110108221512.000|20110108221515.000|TR0|if they are hit or damaged would cause 
20110108221515.000|20110108221518.000|TR0|more concern than other areas of the brain.
20110108221518.000|20110108221520.000|TR0|
20110108221520.000|20110108221523.000|TR0|LEMON:  Can she can go on and lead a 
20110108221523.000|20110108221526.000|TR0|normal life after this, if she does, 
20110108221526.000|20110108221529.000|TR0|indeed make a full recovery?
20110108221529.000|20110108221531.000|TR0|
20110108221531.000|20110108221534.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, you know, I couldn't say 
20110108221534.000|20110108221537.000|TR0|that right now and I'm not sure her 
20110108221537.000|20110108221540.000|TR0|doctors could say that right now.  
20110108221540.000|20110108221542.000|TR0|Because, this is, you know, obviously in 
20110108221542.000|20110108221545.000|TR0|the very acute aftermath of this.  But, 
20110108221545.000|20110108221548.000|TR0|again, I think at this stage, after a 
20110108221548.000|20110108221550.000|TR0|close range gunshot wound to the head, 
20110108221550.000|20110108221553.000|TR0|that she's alive, obviously, she's 
20110108221553.000|20110108221556.000|TR0|following commands.  Those are good signs. 
20110108221556.000|20110108221559.000|TR0|Exactly what her function will be, will 
20110108221559.000|20110108221601.000|TR0|she have any difficulties with speech, 
20110108221601.000|20110108221604.000|TR0|with strength, all those things, I don't 
20110108221604.000|20110108221607.000|TR0|think anybody could or probably should 
20110108221607.000|20110108221609.000|TR0|frankly say at this time for sure yet.
20110108221609.000|20110108221612.000|TR0|
20110108221612.000|20110108221615.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right.  Our chief medical

20110108221709.000|20110108221712.000|TR0|LEMON:  Welcome back everyone.  We're 
20110108221712.000|20110108221715.000|TR0|following breaking news. Democratic 
20110108221715.000|20110108221718.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of 
20110108221718.000|20110108221720.000|TR0|Arizona fighting for her life right now, 
20110108221720.000|20110108221723.000|TR0|after being shot at close range by a 
20110108221723.000|20110108221726.000|TR0|gunman.  CNN just moments ago found out 
20110108221726.000|20110108221728.000|TR0|the name of that suspect.  They believe 
20110108221728.000|20110108221731.000|TR0|the gunman, according to a law enforcement 
20110108221731.000|20110108221734.000|TR0|source, a U.S. law enforcement source and 
20110108221734.000|20110108221737.000|TR0|an Arizona law enforcement source, Jared 
20110108221737.000|20110108221739.000|TR0|Lee Loughner, 22 years old.  We're also 
20110108221739.000|20110108221742.000|TR0|learning now, a 9 millimeter glock handgun 
20110108221742.000|20110108221745.000|TR0|found at the scene, recovered at the scene

20110108221747.000|20110108221750.000|TR0|are the details.  And new details that are 
20110108221750.000|20110108221753.000|TR0|coming in now.
20110108221753.000|20110108221756.000|TR0|
20110108221756.000|20110108221758.000|TR0|Meantime, let's go to Washington with our 
20110108221758.000|20110108221801.000|TR0|chief white house correspondent Ed Henry.

20110108221812.000|20110108221815.000|TR0|Ed, I'm going to start with you.  The 
20110108221815.000|20110108221817.000|TR0|president spoke moments ago about this 
20110108221817.000|20110108221820.000|TR0|tragedy.  How did he find out about the 
20110108221820.000|20110108221823.000|TR0|news and what's the reaction there at the 
20110108221823.000|20110108221826.000|TR0|White House?
20110108221826.000|20110108221828.000|TR0|
20110108221828.000|20110108221831.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: 
20110108221831.000|20110108221834.000|TR0| Well, you're right, Don, the president 
20110108221834.000|20110108221836.000|TR0|came out and said that this is a time for 
20110108221836.000|20110108221839.000|TR0|everyone in Arizona, but also everyone 
20110108221839.000|20110108221842.000|TR0|around the nation to come together.  We're 
20110108221842.000|20110108221845.000|TR0|getting new information from a senior 
20110108221845.000|20110108221847.000|TR0|White House official about when the 
20110108221847.000|20110108221850.000|TR0|president was notified.  It was about 1:20 
20110108221850.000|20110108221853.000|TR0|p.m. Eastern Time.  He was told by John 
20110108221853.000|20110108221856.000|TR0|Brennan, that's his principle Homeland 
20110108221856.000|20110108221858.000|TR0|Security Advisor here at the White House, 
20110108221858.000|20110108221901.000|TR0|as well as Jim Messina who is a deputy 
20110108221901.000|20110108221904.000|TR0|chief of staff, he's involved in 
20110108221904.000|20110108221906.000|TR0|operational details here at the White 
20110108221906.000|20110108221909.000|TR0|House.  Then we're told that at about 3:00 
20110108221909.000|20110108221912.000|TR0|p.m. Eastern Time, the president started 
20110108221912.000|20110108221915.000|TR0|making a series of phone calls, 
20110108221915.000|20110108221917.000|TR0|congressional leaders and others.  And was 
20110108221917.000|20110108221920.000|TR0|also starting to receive some briefings, 
20110108221920.000|20110108221923.000|TR0|starting with FBI Director Bob Mueller, 
20110108221923.000|20110108221925.000|TR0|his own Secretary Janet Napolitano, as 
20110108221925.000|20110108221928.000|TR0|well as the attorney general of the United 
20110108221928.000|20110108221931.000|TR0|States, Eric Holder, his National Security 
20110108221931.000|20110108221934.000|TR0|Advisor Tom Donilon.
20110108221934.000|20110108221936.000|TR0|
20110108221936.000|20110108221939.000|TR0|So, you can get an idea, a several other 
20110108221939.000|20110108221942.000|TR0|officials as well.  But you get the 
20110108221942.000|20110108221945.000|TR0|magnitude of how this is touching just 
20110108221945.000|20110108221947.000|TR0|about every layer of this administration, 
20110108221947.000|20110108221950.000|TR0|this federal government right now.  
20110108221950.000|20110108221953.000|TR0|Critical to underline as well that after 
20110108221953.000|20110108221955.000|TR0|receiving those briefings, the president 
20110108221955.000|20110108221958.000|TR0|himself noted this in his remarks, he told 
20110108221958.000|20110108222001.000|TR0|the FBI Director Robert Mueller to fly to 
20110108222001.000|20110108222004.000|TR0|Arizona personally to help oversee the 
20110108222004.000|20110108222006.000|TR0|coordination of this investigation, all of 
20110108222006.000|20110108222009.000|TR0|these local law enforcement as well as 
20110108222009.000|20110108222012.000|TR0|federal investigators involved in this.  
20110108222012.000|20110108222014.000|TR0|And the president made those calls and he 
20110108222014.000|20110108222017.000|TR0|mentioned congressional leaders in both 
20110108222017.000|20110108222020.000|TR0|parties.  But also important to note, 
20110108222020.000|20110108222023.000|TR0|we're just now learning the president also 
20110108222023.000|20110108222025.000|TR0|called Congresswoman Giffords' husband and 
20110108222025.000|20110108222028.000|TR0|left a message, he did not reach him 
20110108222028.000|20110108222031.000|TR0|though.
20110108222031.000|20110108222034.000|TR0|
20110108222034.000|20110108222036.000|TR0|We had gotten earlier reports that her 
20110108222036.000|20110108222039.000|TR0|husband, as well as maybe a child was 
20110108222039.000|20110108222042.000|TR0|trying to fly from Texas to Arizona.  
20110108222042.000|20110108222044.000|TR0|We're trying to piece all that together.  
20110108222044.000|20110108222047.000|TR0|But we're told the president reached out 
20110108222047.000|20110108222050.000|TR0|to the husband, could not reach him, left 
20110108222050.000|20110108222053.000|TR0|a message.  So you get an idea of both the 
20110108222053.000|20110108222055.000|TR0|personal as well as just the job that has 
20110108222055.000|20110108222058.000|TR0|to be done by this Federal government to 
20110108222058.000|20110108222101.000|TR0|try to respond as quickly as they can to 
20110108222101.000|20110108222103.000|TR0|get to the bottom of all of this -- Don.
20110108222103.000|20110108222106.000|TR0|
20110108222106.000|20110108222109.000|TR0|LEMON:  Ed Henry, stand by.  I don't mean 
20110108222109.000|20110108222112.000|TR0|to cut you up.  We have some developing 
20110108222112.000|20110108222114.000|TR0|news here.  I want to go to our Susan 
20110108222114.000|20110108222117.000|TR0|Candiotti who is joining us on the story, 
20110108222117.000|20110108222120.000|TR0|as well.  Susan, you have some new 
20110108222120.000|20110108222123.000|TR0|information were told about the gun that 
20110108222123.000|20110108222125.000|TR0|was recovered from the scene.
20110108222125.000|20110108222128.000|TR0|
20110108222128.000|20110108222131.000|TR0|SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN NATIONAL 
20110108222131.000|20110108222133.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Don.  We 
20110108222133.000|20110108222136.000|TR0|don't know exactly where the gun was 
20110108222136.000|20110108222139.000|TR0|recovered from.  However, a law 
20110108222139.000|20110108222142.000|TR0|enforcement source has identified it as a 
20110108222142.000|20110108222144.000|TR0|glock 9 millimeter, glock 9 millimeter 
20110108222144.000|20110108222147.000|TR0|which of course can hold several bullets 
20110108222147.000|20110108222150.000|TR0|in one clip.  I don't have the specific 
20110108222150.000|20110108222152.000|TR0|number at hand.  However, law enforcement 
20110108222152.000|20110108222155.000|TR0|authorities naturally at this point will 
20110108222155.000|20110108222158.000|TR0|be looking it over, tracing the weapon, 
20110108222158.000|20110108222201.000|TR0|finding out the registration, who owned 
20110108222201.000|20110108222203.000|TR0|it, where was it bought, if they can 
20110108222203.000|20110108222206.000|TR0|identify that information and trace it 
20110108222206.000|20110108222209.000|TR0|back.  At this time, I cannot say whether 
20110108222209.000|20110108222212.000|TR0|it has been traced directly to the suspect 
20110108222212.000|20110108222214.000|TR0|who has been identified and who is in 
20110108222214.000|20110108222217.000|TR0|custody at this time.
20110108222217.000|20110108222220.000|TR0|
20110108222220.000|20110108222222.000|TR0|LEMON:  Susan, I have been told that the 
20110108222222.000|20110108222225.000|TR0|shooter may have gotten off as many as 20 
20110108222225.000|20110108222228.000|TR0|rounds, 20 shots that he fired 
20110108222228.000|20110108222231.000|TR0|specifically at the congresswoman?
20110108222231.000|20110108222233.000|TR0|
20110108222233.000|20110108222236.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  Well, you have been hearing 
20110108222236.000|20110108222239.000|TR0|more about what the weapon (INAUDIBLE) 
20110108222239.000|20110108222241.000|TR0|have been saying, that's correct.  A 
20110108222241.000|20110108222244.000|TR0|number of shots were fired according to 
20110108222244.000|20110108222247.000|TR0|witnesses.  That, of course, is part of 
20110108222247.000|20110108222250.000|TR0|the investigation, trying to recovery as 
20110108222250.000|20110108222252.000|TR0|many of those shell casings as possible to 
20110108222252.000|20110108222255.000|TR0|determine how many shots were fired during 
20110108222255.000|20110108222258.000|TR0|the course of this terrible shooting.
20110108222258.000|20110108222300.000|TR0|
20110108222300.000|20110108222303.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right.  Susan Candiotti with 
20110108222303.000|20110108222306.000|TR0|new information on the gun, which was 
20110108222306.000|20110108222309.000|TR0|recovered.  Not sure if it was at the 
20110108222309.000|20110108222311.000|TR0|scene or where it was recovered.  Then you 
20110108222311.000|20110108222314.000|TR0|saw some law enforcement there in a 
20110108222314.000|20110108222317.000|TR0|parking lot, in an area looking, searching 
20110108222317.000|20110108222320.000|TR0|that had been cordoned off.  I want to go 
20110108222320.000|20110108222322.000|TR0|back now to Washington.  We just spoke 
20110108222322.000|20110108222325.000|TR0|with our Ed Henry.  I want to go to Dana 
20110108222325.000|20110108222328.000|TR0|Bash.  Ed -- Dana, Ed talked about the 
20110108222328.000|20110108222330.000|TR0|importance of this from the White House.  
20110108222330.000|20110108222333.000|TR0|And I'm sure, this is your beat, Congress. 
20110108222333.000|20110108222336.000|TR0|People are very concerned about this.  
20110108222336.000|20110108222339.000|TR0|What is the mood among our lawmakers now?
20110108222339.000|20110108222341.000|TR0|
20110108222341.000|20110108222344.000|TR0|DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL 
20110108222344.000|20110108222347.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we've already heard 
20110108222347.000|20110108222349.000|TR0|from several lawmakers in both parties 
20110108222349.000|20110108222352.000|TR0|that they have been burning up the phone 
20110108222352.000|20110108222355.000|TR0|lines, burning up the internet talking to 
20110108222355.000|20110108222358.000|TR0|each other about obviously what a 
20110108222358.000|20110108222400.000|TR0|horrible, horrible tragedy this is. This 
20110108222400.000|20110108222403.000|TR0|is their friend, this is their colleague 
20110108222403.000|20110108222406.000|TR0|and they're thinking, you know, this could 
20110108222406.000|20110108222409.000|TR0|be us, frankly.  I want to say a little 
20110108222409.000|20110108222411.000|TR0|bit about Gabrielle Giffords, Gabby 
20110108222411.000|20110108222414.000|TR0|Giffords as she is know, she was just 
20110108222414.000|20110108222417.000|TR0|elected to her third term, Don, she's 
20110108222417.000|20110108222419.000|TR0|relatively new to Congress.  She came in 
20110108222419.000|20110108222422.000|TR0|with the big democratic wave back in 2006 
20110108222422.000|20110108222425.000|TR0|and she represents a moderate, she's a 
20110108222425.000|20110108222428.000|TR0|real moderate.  She represents a pretty 
20110108222428.000|20110108222430.000|TR0|conservative districts right along the 
20110108222430.000|20110108222433.000|TR0|border in Arizona.  She deals with 
20110108222433.000|20110108222436.000|TR0|immigration issues probably as much or 
20110108222436.000|20110108222438.000|TR0|more than any other member of Congress, 
20110108222438.000|20110108222441.000|TR0|immigration obviously being a very, very 
20110108222441.000|20110108222444.000|TR0|fiery and tumultuous issue.
20110108222444.000|20110108222447.000|TR0|
20110108222447.000|20110108222449.000|TR0|But she is, she -- I've mentioned earlier 
20110108222449.000|20110108222452.000|TR0|that I actually happened to talk to her 
20110108222452.000|20110108222455.000|TR0|just yesterday, just yesterday in the 
20110108222455.000|20110108222458.000|TR0|hallways.  She was coming off of the House 
20110108222458.000|20110108222500.000|TR0|floor, talking about how clearly sort of 
20110108222500.000|20110108222503.000|TR0|relieved she was that she had won this 
20110108222503.000|20110108222506.000|TR0|third term, that most, many of her 
20110108222506.000|20110108222508.000|TR0|colleagues, specifically those Blue Dogs 
20110108222508.000|20110108222511.000|TR0|or conservative Democrats did not make it, 
20110108222511.000|20110108222514.000|TR0|did not win re-election, she did and she 
20110108222514.000|20110108222517.000|TR0|talked about a wonderful trip that she was 
20110108222517.000|20110108222519.000|TR0|able to take the last minute with her 
20110108222519.000|20110108222522.000|TR0|parents to Rome and she was able to go see 
20110108222522.000|20110108222525.000|TR0|the Vatican.  And so, she was in good 
20110108222525.000|20110108222527.000|TR0|spirits and eager to get back home to 
20110108222527.000|20110108222530.000|TR0|Arizona for the weekend.  As she does, as 
20110108222530.000|20110108222533.000|TR0|we've heard from many of her friends in 
20110108222533.000|20110108222536.000|TR0|the colleagues.
20110108222536.000|20110108222538.000|TR0|
20110108222538.000|20110108222541.000|TR0|So, often even though it's not a close 
20110108222541.000|20110108222544.000|TR0|trip because she sees it as her job to do 
20110108222544.000|20110108222547.000|TR0|what she was doing when this horrible 
20110108222547.000|20110108222549.000|TR0|tragedy happened, which is to talk to 
20110108222549.000|20110108222552.000|TR0|constituents.  Now, on the other issue of 
20110108222552.000|20110108222555.000|TR0|members of Congress, we are getting 
20110108222555.000|20110108222557.000|TR0|statements pouring in, pouring in from 
20110108222557.000|20110108222600.000|TR0|Democrats, from Republicans, from the 
20110108222600.000|20110108222603.000|TR0|Senate,  from the House, from the new 
20110108222603.000|20110108222606.000|TR0|republican Speaker John Boehner, that the 
20110108222606.000|20110108222608.000|TR0|democratic leaders all across the board 
20110108222608.000|20110108222611.000|TR0|are pouring out their concern, their 
20110108222611.000|20110108222614.000|TR0|emotions and their anger about what has 
20110108222614.000|20110108222616.000|TR0|happened.  And on the issue of frankly of 
20110108222616.000|20110108222619.000|TR0|safety and of what members of Congress 
20110108222619.000|20110108222622.000|TR0|need to be looking for now, we have gotten 
20110108222622.000|20110108222625.000|TR0|some notices that the capital police, they 
20110108222625.000|20110108222627.000|TR0|have sent out to both House members and 
20110108222627.000|20110108222630.000|TR0|Senate members.  And I just got this and I 
20110108222630.000|20110108222633.000|TR0|want to read to you, this is actually...
20110108222633.000|20110108222636.000|TR0|
20110108222636.000|20110108222638.000|TR0|LEMON:  Before you read that, Dana, I'm 
20110108222638.000|20110108222641.000|TR0|going to get to you.  I want to alert our 
20110108222641.000|20110108222644.000|TR0|viewers, this is new video, this is the 
20110108222644.000|20110108222646.000|TR0|FBI at the crime scene.  As you heard from 
20110108222646.000|20110108222649.000|TR0|the president, he's saying -- he is 
20110108222649.000|20110108222652.000|TR0|sparing no expense in finding out who is 
20110108222652.000|20110108222655.000|TR0|responsible for this, the FBI is involved. 
20110108222655.000|20110108222657.000|TR0| This is new video from our affiliate KNXV 
20110108222657.000|20110108222700.000|TR0|at the scene. And you can see they have it 
20110108222700.000|20110108222703.000|TR0|cord off.  And they are searching.  Dana, 
20110108222703.000|20110108222705.000|TR0|that leads me to my next question to you, 
20110108222705.000|20110108222708.000|TR0|what about security for our congressman?
20110108222708.000|20110108222711.000|TR0|
20110108222711.000|20110108222714.000|TR0|BASH:  Yes.
20110108222714.000|20110108222716.000|TR0|
20110108222716.000|20110108222719.000|TR0|LEMON:  The president and higher ranking 
20110108222719.000|20110108222722.000|TR0|members of our government have secret 
20110108222722.000|20110108222725.000|TR0|service.  That doesn't happen for 
20110108222725.000|20110108222727.000|TR0|congressman, does it?
20110108222727.000|20110108222730.000|TR0|
20110108222730.000|20110108222733.000|TR0|BASH:  Not rank and file congressman.  
20110108222733.000|20110108222735.000|TR0|Frankly, before I answer that, I just want 
20110108222735.000|20110108222738.000|TR0|to get to this little piece I think of 
20110108222738.000|20110108222741.000|TR0|news that came out of this notice that 
20110108222741.000|20110108222744.000|TR0|went out to all senators that we got sent 
20110108222744.000|20110108222746.000|TR0|to us from a source, and that is, "there 
20110108222746.000|20110108222749.000|TR0|is no indication at this time that this 
20110108222749.000|20110108222752.000|TR0|event is part of a larger threat against 
20110108222752.000|20110108222754.000|TR0|the congressional membership or has a 
20110108222754.000|20110108222757.000|TR0|nexus to terrorism.  But the investigation 
20110108222757.000|20110108222800.000|TR0|is ongoing."  Now, this is a notice again 
20110108222800.000|20110108222803.000|TR0|that went out from the capital, police 
20110108222803.000|20110108222805.000|TR0|actually went to Senate offices but very 
20110108222805.000|20110108222808.000|TR0|interesting to note that their  initial 
20110108222808.000|20110108222811.000|TR0|indication is that there are no larger 
20110108222811.000|20110108222814.000|TR0|threats to other members of Congress, 
20110108222814.000|20110108222816.000|TR0|which brings me to answer that question 
20110108222816.000|20110108222819.000|TR0|that you just asked Don, about what kind 
20110108222819.000|20110108222822.000|TR0|of security members have.
20110108222822.000|20110108222824.000|TR0|
20110108222824.000|20110108222827.000|TR0|Capital police understandably, they're 
20110108222827.000|20110108222830.000|TR0|very reluctant to talk about security 
20110108222830.000|20110108222833.000|TR0|because of what we just saw here.  But the 
20110108222833.000|20110108222835.000|TR0|bottom line is that there is security for 
20110108222835.000|20110108222838.000|TR0|members of the leadership, people who are 
20110108222838.000|20110108222841.000|TR0|high profile, and rank and file members, 
20110108222841.000|20110108222843.000|TR0|they get on planes, they walk around just 
20110108222843.000|20110108222846.000|TR0|like you and me Don, for the most part, 
20110108222846.000|20110108222849.000|TR0|unless there happens to be a specific 
20110108222849.000|20110108222852.000|TR0|threat that security officials in the 
20110108222852.000|20110108222854.000|TR0|capital police know about.  And they 
20110108222854.000|20110108222857.000|TR0|obviously do monitor that.  There was a 
20110108222857.000|20110108222900.000|TR0|time over the past year during the health 
20110108222900.000|20110108222903.000|TR0|care debate for example where we were 
20110108222903.000|20110108222905.000|TR0|reporting extensively on serious threats 
20110108222905.000|20110108222908.000|TR0|to members of Congress.  Gabby Giffords 
20110108222908.000|20110108222911.000|TR0|herself had vandalism to her district 
20110108222911.000|20110108222913.000|TR0|office back in Arizona.  But for the most 
20110108222913.000|20110108222916.000|TR0|part, you know, this is what they do.  
20110108222916.000|20110108222919.000|TR0|They go out and they talk to people, and I 
20110108222919.000|20110108222922.000|TR0|will tell you that Chellie Pingree, she is 
20110108222922.000|20110108222924.000|TR0|one of Gabby Giffords colleagues, she is a 
20110108222924.000|20110108222927.000|TR0|Congresswoman from Maine, she was on air 
20110108222927.000|20110108222930.000|TR0|earlier today and she said that she does 
20110108222930.000|20110108222932.000|TR0|fear that this horrible incident will have 
20110108222932.000|20110108222935.000|TR0|a, quote, "chilling effect on members of 
20110108222935.000|20110108222938.000|TR0|Congress who want to go out and do their 
20110108222938.000|20110108222941.000|TR0|jobs."
20110108222941.000|20110108222943.000|TR0|
20110108222943.000|20110108222946.000|TR0|LEMON:  And Dana, hold that though, I want 
20110108222946.000|20110108222949.000|TR0|to talk to you in a bit about the mood of 
20110108222949.000|20110108222952.000|TR0|politics, left versus right and all of 
20110108222952.000|20110108222954.000|TR0|this and there, there are some concerns 
20110108222954.000|20110108222957.000|TR0|we've been getting, hearing from people 
20110108222957.000|20110108223000.000|TR0|about, this may have triggered some of 
20110108223000.000|20110108223002.000|TR0|that.  We don't know.  We don't know the 
20110108223002.000|20110108223005.000|TR0|suspect's motive or motivation right now, 
20110108223005.000|20110108223008.000|TR0|but I want to talk to you about that, but 
20110108223008.000|20110108223011.000|TR0|we need to take a quick break here.
20110108223011.000|20110108223013.000|TR0|
20110108223013.000|20110108223016.000|TR0|Also when we come back, we're going to 
20110108223016.000|20110108223019.000|TR0|talk with Representative Ed Pastor, he's a 
20110108223019.000|20110108223021.000|TR0|democrat, he's from Arizona.  He has known 
20110108223021.000|20110108223024.000|TR0|Giffords since they were state senators.  
20110108223024.000|20110108223027.000|TR0|And he received a phone call from the 
20110108223027.000|20110108223030.000|TR0|president.  That's next.
20110108223030.000|20110108223032.000|TR0|
20110108223032.000|20110108223035.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110108223035.000|20110108223038.000|TR0|
20110108223038.000|20110108223041.000|TR0|LEMON:  We are continuing to follow this 
20110108223041.000|20110108223043.000|TR0|breaking news for you.  A shocking attack 
20110108223043.000|20110108223046.000|TR0|this morning at a Tucson, Arizona grocery 
20110108223046.000|20110108223049.000|TR0|store.  Six people are dead, 12 others 
20110108223049.000|20110108223051.000|TR0|wounded, including Democratic 
20110108223051.000|20110108223054.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords who 
20110108223054.000|20110108223057.000|TR0|suffered a gunshot to the head at close 
20110108223057.000|20110108223100.000|TR0|range. Giffords is now out of surgery and 
20110108223100.000|20110108223102.000|TR0|is listed in critical condition, but 
20110108223102.000|20110108223105.000|TR0|doctors say they are optimistic about her 
20110108223105.000|20110108223108.000|TR0|recovery.  We've also learned that Federal 
20110108223108.000|20110108223110.000|TR0|Judge John Roll was killed in the attack.  
20110108223110.000|20110108223113.000|TR0|The shooting happened this morning while 
20110108223113.000|20110108223116.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords was holding what's 
20110108223116.000|20110108223119.000|TR0|called a constituent meeting at the store. 
20110108223119.000|20110108223121.000|TR0| Police do have a suspect now in custody 
20110108223121.000|20110108223124.000|TR0|that we learned a short time ago.  This is 
20110108223124.000|20110108223127.000|TR0|who they're identifying the man as, 
20110108223127.000|20110108223130.000|TR0|22-year-old Jared Loughner, 22- year-old 
20110108223130.000|20110108223132.000|TR0|Jared Loughner.  They have also recovered 
20110108223132.000|20110108223135.000|TR0|a hand gun, our Susan Candiotti tells us, 
20110108223135.000|20110108223138.000|TR0|it is a 9-millimeter hand gun.
20110108223138.000|20110108223140.000|TR0|
20110108223140.000|20110108223143.000|TR0|And we saw new video moments ago from our 
20110108223143.000|20110108223146.000|TR0|affiliate KNXV of FBI agents on the ground 
20110108223146.000|20110108223149.000|TR0|searching for any clues, any information 
20110108223149.000|20110108223151.000|TR0|that they can get to find out exactly what 
20110108223151.000|20110108223154.000|TR0|happened here.  OK, joining me now is Dana 
20110108223154.000|20110108223157.000|TR0|Bash.  Again, Dana, before the break, I 
20110108223157.000|20110108223159.000|TR0|talked to you about the mood and the tone 
20110108223159.000|20110108223202.000|TR0|in Washington and politics these days.  We 
20110108223202.000|20110108223205.000|TR0|know what's out there, we've seen what's 
20110108223205.000|20110108223208.000|TR0|going to be happening on social media, 
20110108223208.000|20110108223210.000|TR0|some people blaming, you know, certain 
20110108223210.000|20110108223213.000|TR0|members, certain elected and nonelected 
20110108223213.000|20110108223216.000|TR0|members.  We don't know the motivation 
20110108223216.000|20110108223219.000|TR0|yet.  But does this send some sort of 
20110108223219.000|20110108223221.000|TR0|signal to us and to our lawmakers about 
20110108223221.000|20110108223224.000|TR0|how we view politics and tone?
20110108223224.000|20110108223227.000|TR0|
20110108223227.000|20110108223229.000|TR0|BASH:  Well, you're absolutely right that 
20110108223229.000|20110108223232.000|TR0|we don't know the motivation.  But 
20110108223232.000|20110108223235.000|TR0|regardless, something like this tends to 
20110108223235.000|20110108223238.000|TR0|be a wakeup call.  And we've already heard 
20110108223238.000|20110108223240.000|TR0|from some members of Congress who have 
20110108223240.000|20110108223243.000|TR0|been on our air earlier today saying that 
20110108223243.000|20110108223246.000|TR0|they do hope that this is a wakeup, wakeup 
20110108223246.000|20110108223248.000|TR0|call for both parties to try to get out, 
20110108223248.000|20110108223251.000|TR0|get the word out there to their 
20110108223251.000|20110108223254.000|TR0|supporters, to constituents, to maybe even 
20110108223254.000|20110108223257.000|TR0|the blogosphere which is not easy, to tone 
20110108223257.000|20110108223259.000|TR0|it down a little bit.  You know, we 
20110108223259.000|20110108223302.000|TR0|actually got a statement from John McCain, 
20110108223302.000|20110108223305.000|TR0|the senior senator from Gabby Giffords' 
20110108223305.000|20110108223308.000|TR0|home state of Arizona, who obviously 
20110108223308.000|20110108223310.000|TR0|didn't point the finger that way, but was 
20110108223310.000|20110108223313.000|TR0|very, very strong and I think maybe 
20110108223313.000|20110108223316.000|TR0|indicative of what we're talking about.  
20110108223316.000|20110108223318.000|TR0|He said, whoever did this, whatever 
20110108223318.000|20110108223321.000|TR0|reason, they are a disgrace to Arizona, 
20110108223321.000|20110108223324.000|TR0|this country and the human race.  And he 
20110108223324.000|20110108223327.000|TR0|said, they deserve and will receive the 
20110108223327.000|20110108223329.000|TR0|contempt of all decent people and the 
20110108223329.000|20110108223332.000|TR0|strongest punishment of the law.  When 
20110108223332.000|20110108223335.000|TR0|you're hearing a republican like John 
20110108223335.000|20110108223337.000|TR0|McCain say that, and we're hearing from 
20110108223337.000|20110108223340.000|TR0|John Boehner and other Republicans say 
20110108223340.000|20110108223343.000|TR0|that, it's hard to imagine that there 
20110108223343.000|20110108223346.000|TR0|isn't going to be a coming together of 
20110108223346.000|20110108223348.000|TR0|some sort of both parties in Congress 
20110108223348.000|20110108223351.000|TR0|after this.
20110108223351.000|20110108223354.000|TR0|
20110108223354.000|20110108223357.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right.  Dana, thank you very 
20110108223357.000|20110108223359.000|TR0|much.  Please stand by, because I want to 
20110108223359.000|20110108223402.000|TR0|talk to someone who knows the 
20110108223402.000|20110108223405.000|TR0|congresswoman. Joining me now is 
20110108223405.000|20110108223407.000|TR0|Representative Ed Pastor, he's a democrat 
20110108223407.000|20110108223410.000|TR0|from Arizona.  He's known Giffords since, 
20110108223410.000|20110108223413.000|TR0|let's say, were state senators. And he 
20110108223413.000|20110108223416.000|TR0|received a phone call from the president.  
20110108223416.000|20110108223418.000|TR0|Hello, Congressman. Hello, Representative.
20110108223418.000|20110108223421.000|TR0|
20110108223421.000|20110108223424.000|TR0|REP. ED PASTOR (D), ARIZONA (on the 
20110108223424.000|20110108223426.000|TR0|phone):  How are you?
20110108223426.000|20110108223429.000|TR0|
20110108223429.000|20110108223432.000|TR0|LEMON:  I'm OK.  I imagine you're not 
20110108223432.000|20110108223435.000|TR0|doing so well today.
20110108223435.000|20110108223437.000|TR0|
20110108223437.000|20110108223440.000|TR0|PASTOR:  Well, it's gone like a roller 
20110108223440.000|20110108223443.000|TR0|coaster ride.  When I first heard that she 
20110108223443.000|20110108223446.000|TR0|had been killed, obviously it was great 
20110108223446.000|20110108223448.000|TR0|sadness.  And then when there was a report 
20110108223448.000|20110108223451.000|TR0|that she was going to be in surgery, then 
20110108223451.000|20110108223454.000|TR0|there was more optimism.  And now when I 
20110108223454.000|20110108223456.000|TR0|heard the report that the surgeons have 
20110108223456.000|20110108223459.000|TR0|completed the operation and that they're 
20110108223459.000|20110108223502.000|TR0|optimistic she's going to recover, well, 
20110108223502.000|20110108223505.000|TR0|there's an optimism and joy.  Because, 
20110108223505.000|20110108223507.000|TR0|obviously, as a young woman, promising 
20110108223507.000|20110108223510.000|TR0|career, it would have been very tragic if 
20110108223510.000|20110108223513.000|TR0|her life had been taken.
20110108223513.000|20110108223515.000|TR0|
20110108223515.000|20110108223518.000|TR0|LEMON:  You received a phone call today?
20110108223518.000|20110108223521.000|TR0|
20110108223521.000|20110108223524.000|TR0|PASTOR:  Yes, I did.
20110108223524.000|20110108223526.000|TR0|
20110108223526.000|20110108223529.000|TR0|LEMON:  From the president? PASTOR:  The 
20110108223529.000|20110108223532.000|TR0|president called to let me know that the 
20110108223532.000|20110108223534.000|TR0|White House was very much involved, was 
20110108223534.000|20110108223537.000|TR0|keeping up with what was happening and 
20110108223537.000|20110108223540.000|TR0|that they were remorseful this happened in 
20110108223540.000|20110108223543.000|TR0|Arizona, that they would let us know as 
20110108223543.000|20110108223545.000|TR0|news came in to the White House and they 
20110108223545.000|20110108223548.000|TR0|would keep us abreast of what was 
20110108223548.000|20110108223551.000|TR0|happening.  He also told me that he talked 
20110108223551.000|20110108223554.000|TR0|to the governor and was making available 
20110108223554.000|20110108223556.000|TR0|to Arizona all the resources of the 
20110108223556.000|20110108223559.000|TR0|federal government to make sure the 
20110108223559.000|20110108223602.000|TR0|investigation was done and people who were 
20110108223602.000|20110108223604.000|TR0|injured and needed help would be helped.
20110108223604.000|20110108223607.000|TR0|
20110108223607.000|20110108223610.000|TR0|LEMON:  Listen, Representative, thank you 
20110108223610.000|20110108223613.000|TR0|so much.  Stand by, because I want to talk 
20110108223613.000|20110108223615.000|TR0|a little bit more with you.
20110108223615.000|20110108223618.000|TR0|
20110108223618.000|20110108223621.000|TR0|I don't know if you heard my conversation 
20110108223621.000|20110108223623.000|TR0|with our congressional correspondent, Dana 
20110108223623.000|20110108223626.000|TR0|Bash about -- she's say thing is a wakeup 
20110108223626.000|20110108223629.000|TR0|call to both parties and people who are in 
20110108223629.000|20110108223632.000|TR0|Washington, and obviously beyond.

20110108223818.000|20110108223821.000|TR0|
20110108223821.000|20110108223823.000|TR0|Congressman Pastor, I was talking to you 
20110108223823.000|20110108223826.000|TR0|before the break.  Dana Bash and I were 
20110108223826.000|20110108223829.000|TR0|talking about the members of Congress and 
20110108223829.000|20110108223831.000|TR0|Senate, our leaders in Washington, and 
20110108223831.000|20110108223834.000|TR0|whether or not this is a wakeup call.
20110108223834.000|20110108223837.000|TR0|
20110108223837.000|20110108223840.000|TR0|PASTOR:  Oh, yes it is.  I have to tell 
20110108223840.000|20110108223842.000|TR0|you that I've heard from colleagues that 
20110108223842.000|20110108223845.000|TR0|this is a chilling effect.  Obviously, 
20110108223845.000|20110108223848.000|TR0|most of us don't have security.  And today 
20110108223848.000|20110108223850.000|TR0|in some states, Arizona, a person can get 
20110108223850.000|20110108223853.000|TR0|a gun with great ease.  and because of the 
20110108223853.000|20110108223856.000|TR0|24-hour, seven days a week, you can get it 
20110108223856.000|20110108223859.000|TR0|on any radio show or TV or blogging and 
20110108223859.000|20110108223901.000|TR0|all that kind of stuff, where all the hate 
20110108223901.000|20110108223904.000|TR0|is being spewed against politicians and 
20110108223904.000|20110108223907.000|TR0|members of Congress and elected officials 
20110108223907.000|20110108223910.000|TR0|that, you know, people think now, if they 
20110108223910.000|20110108223912.000|TR0|want to make a statement, they can do it 
20110108223912.000|20110108223915.000|TR0|by bringing bodily harm to someone who 
20110108223915.000|20110108223918.000|TR0|doesn't agree with them.  LEMON:  
20110108223918.000|20110108223920.000|TR0|Representative Franks is in Washington, 
20110108223920.000|20110108223923.000|TR0|our Washington bureau.
20110108223923.000|20110108223926.000|TR0|
20110108223926.000|20110108223929.000|TR0|I want to ask you the same question, 
20110108223929.000|20110108223931.000|TR0|Representative Franks.
20110108223931.000|20110108223934.000|TR0|
20110108223934.000|20110108223937.000|TR0|REP. TRENT FRANKS, (R), ARIZONA:  I think 
20110108223937.000|20110108223939.000|TR0|it should remind all of us is true 
20110108223939.000|20110108223942.000|TR0|tolerance is not pretending you have no 
20110108223942.000|20110108223945.000|TR0|differences with each other.  It is that 
20110108223945.000|20110108223948.000|TR0|you have a continuing commitment to be 
20110108223948.000|20110108223950.000|TR0|kind and decent and respectful of each 
20110108223950.000|20110108223953.000|TR0|other in spite of those differences.
20110108223953.000|20110108223956.000|TR0|
20110108223956.000|20110108223959.000|TR0|What happened today is horrifying beyond 
20110108223959.000|20110108224001.000|TR0|my ability to articulate. It's been such 
20110108224001.000|20110108224004.000|TR0|an up-and-down thing emotionally because 
20110108224004.000|20110108224007.000|TR0|we were told different things.  I'm just 
20110108224007.000|20110108224009.000|TR0|so thankful that it looks like Mrs. 
20110108224009.000|20110108224012.000|TR0|Giffords is going to recover.  I pray she 
20110108224012.000|20110108224015.000|TR0|does in every way.  And I am so deeply 
20110108224015.000|20110108224018.000|TR0|hurt by the loss of the other people that 
20110108224018.000|20110108224020.000|TR0|were at this event today, the judge and 
20110108224020.000|20110108224023.000|TR0|this little 9-year-old girl.  I don't 
20110108224023.000|20110108224026.000|TR0|think any of us sometimes understand what 
20110108224026.000|20110108224028.000|TR0|a breathtaking loss this can be to the 
20110108224028.000|20110108224031.000|TR0|loved ones that surround them.

20110108224034.000|20110108224037.000|TR0|And I hope somehow that, as a people, in 
20110108224037.000|20110108224039.000|TR0|general, that we just realize that the 
20110108224039.000|20110108224042.000|TR0|respect for innocent human life and being 
20110108224042.000|20110108224045.000|TR0|kind to each other is so very important, 
20110108224045.000|20110108224048.000|TR0|because we are here for such a short time.
20110108224048.000|20110108224050.000|TR0|
20110108224050.000|20110108224053.000|TR0|LEMON:  I'm glad you mentioned Judge Roll. 
20110108224053.000|20110108224056.000|TR0| Here's what we are hearing.  I want to 
20110108224056.000|20110108224058.000|TR0|ask you this, Representative.  He had 
20110108224058.000|20110108224101.000|TR0|protection from U.S. Marshals a year ago 
20110108224101.000|20110108224104.000|TR0|or so because of a huge multimillion- 
20110108224104.000|20110108224107.000|TR0|dollar immigration suit he decided.  He 
20110108224107.000|20110108224109.000|TR0|was a Bush 41 appointee.  Do you know 
20110108224109.000|20110108224112.000|TR0|anything about that?
20110108224112.000|20110108224115.000|TR0|
20110108224115.000|20110108224117.000|TR0|FRANKS:  I'm aware of it, but the reality 
20110108224117.000|20110108224120.000|TR0|is, I think that when this analysis comes 
20110108224120.000|20110108224123.000|TR0|to an end here -- I'm afraid that really 
20110108224123.000|20110108224126.000|TR0|what's happened here is you've got a 
20110108224126.000|20110108224128.000|TR0|lunatic that's just unhinged, that's just 
20110108224128.000|20110108224131.000|TR0|an evil degenerate, that is at the root of 
20110108224131.000|20110108224134.000|TR0|all this, and to try to analyze it 
20110108224134.000|20110108224137.000|TR0|politically, at least now is premature.  
20110108224137.000|20110108224139.000|TR0|Because it seems to me, from what I've 
20110108224139.000|20110108224142.000|TR0|learned so far, tells me this is just a 
20110108224142.000|20110108224145.000|TR0|monster that thought he would get to his 
20110108224145.000|20110108224147.000|TR0|15 minutes of fame by killing some people. 
20110108224147.000|20110108224150.000|TR0| And it's hard somehow to defend against 
20110108224150.000|20110108224153.000|TR0|that.
20110108224153.000|20110108224156.000|TR0|
20110108224156.000|20110108224158.000|TR0|I hope that somehow, as a people, we don't 
20110108224158.000|20110108224201.000|TR0|let ourselves be intimidated by evil 
20110108224201.000|20110108224204.000|TR0|monsters like this, that somehow we 
20110108224204.000|20110108224206.000|TR0|realize, yes, there is great risks in a 
20110108224206.000|20110108224209.000|TR0|free republic where we have the 
20110108224209.000|20110108224212.000|TR0|opportunity to interact closely with those 
20110108224212.000|20110108224215.000|TR0|we represent.  But freedom is still worth 
20110108224215.000|20110108224217.000|TR0|a lot of risk.  And I hope we just send a 
20110108224217.000|20110108224220.000|TR0|message to those that would harm innocent 
20110108224220.000|20110108224223.000|TR0|people and the people like Gabby Giffords, 
20110108224223.000|20110108224226.000|TR0|who is the last one in the world anyone 
20110108224226.000|20110108224228.000|TR0|should think about hurting, that we're not 
20110108224228.000|20110108224231.000|TR0|going to be intimidated by you and we're 
20110108224231.000|20110108224234.000|TR0|going to go on and be a free country.  And 
20110108224234.000|20110108224236.000|TR0|God help those that try to come against 
20110108224236.000|20110108224239.000|TR0|free people just doing their job.
20110108224239.000|20110108224242.000|TR0|
20110108224242.000|20110108224245.000|TR0|I have to throw something in quickly.  
20110108224245.000|20110108224247.000|TR0|Gabby Giffords was reading the 
20110108224247.000|20110108224250.000|TR0|Constitution the last time I saw her on 
20110108224250.000|20110108224253.000|TR0|the floor.  She was reading the First 
20110108224253.000|20110108224255.000|TR0|Amendment, which includes the right to 
20110108224255.000|20110108224258.000|TR0|peaceably assemble. She was out doing her 
20110108224258.000|20110108224301.000|TR0|job, exercising her First Amendment rights 
20110108224301.000|20110108224304.000|TR0|when someone shot her at close range.  
20110108224304.000|20110108224306.000|TR0|That should invoke the wrath of the entire 
20110108224306.000|20110108224309.000|TR0|country and we should respond accordingly.
20110108224309.000|20110108224312.000|TR0|
20110108224312.000|20110108224315.000|TR0|LEMON:  Very well put.  Thank you so much 
20110108224315.000|20110108224317.000|TR0|for that, sir.  I want to ask you, you're 
20110108224317.000|20110108224320.000|TR0|a Republican.  She's a Democrat.  It's 
20110108224320.000|20110108224323.000|TR0|been said she was a moderate and that we 
20110108224323.000|20110108224325.000|TR0|heard the Arizona Governor Jan Brewer say 
20110108224325.000|20110108224328.000|TR0|she wasn't really a political in that way, 
20110108224328.000|20110108224331.000|TR0|a partisan, I should say.
20110108224331.000|20110108224334.000|TR0|
20110108224334.000|20110108224336.000|TR0|FRANKS:  I mean, just being honest, Gabby 
20110108224336.000|20110108224339.000|TR0|and I were pretty much at opposite ends of 
20110108224339.000|20110108224342.000|TR0|the political spectrum.  But there was 
20110108224342.000|20110108224344.000|TR0|never an unkind or terse or mean 
20110108224344.000|20110108224347.000|TR0|communication or word that came between 
20110108224347.000|20110108224350.000|TR0|us. She was always absolutely kind and 
20110108224350.000|20110108224353.000|TR0|decent to me.  And I just -- I suppose 
20110108224353.000|20110108224355.000|TR0|that just intensifies the hole in my heart 
20110108224355.000|20110108224358.000|TR0|I have for her and all of those that 
20110108224358.000|20110108224401.000|TR0|suffered the loss today that they did.
20110108224401.000|20110108224404.000|TR0|
20110108224404.000|20110108224406.000|TR0|LEMON:  Thank you, Representative Ed 
20110108224406.000|20110108224409.000|TR0|Pastor, who is on the phone, and also 
20110108224409.000|20110108224412.000|TR0|Representative Trent Franks, who you see 
20110108224412.000|20110108224414.000|TR0|there in Washington. Thank you for joining 
20110108224414.000|20110108224417.000|TR0|us here on CNN.  My condolences to your 
20110108224417.000|20110108224420.000|TR0|colleague and to your friend, because of 
20110108224420.000|20110108224423.000|TR0|this tragedy.  And hopefully, she will 
20110108224423.000|20110108224425.000|TR0|pull through.

20110108224428.000|20110108224431.000|TR0|Up next, we'll talk to a doctor.  His name 
20110108224431.000|20110108224433.000|TR0|is Park Dietz.  He is a forensic 
20110108224433.000|20110108224436.000|TR0|psychiatrist and criminologist who worked 
20110108224436.000|20110108224439.000|TR0|on infamous cases such as John Hinckley, 
20110108224439.000|20110108224442.000|TR0|Jeffery Dahmer, the Menendez brothers, and 
20110108224442.000|20110108224444.000|TR0|the list goes on.  That's next.

20110108224453.000|20110108224455.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right, breaking news here on 
20110108224455.000|20110108224458.000|TR0|CNN.  And we want to go to Dr. Park Dietz, 
20110108224458.000|20110108224501.000|TR0|who is on the phone right now.  He is a

20110108224517.000|20110108224520.000|TR0|Thank you, Doctor, for joining us.  This 
20110108224520.000|20110108224522.000|TR0|is still all unfolding and we're getting 
20110108224522.000|20110108224525.000|TR0|new information.  But what does it take to 
20110108224525.000|20110108224528.000|TR0|carry out a shooting like this?
20110108224528.000|20110108224531.000|TR0|

20110108224536.000|20110108224539.000|TR0|things going on here.  The first is --

20110108224558.000|20110108224601.000|TR0|LEMON:  Doctor, we're having a little bit 
20110108224601.000|20110108224603.000|TR0|of trouble.  I think we're hearing some 
20110108224603.000|20110108224606.000|TR0|people in the background who may be 
20110108224606.000|20110108224609.000|TR0|speaking.  I don't know if you are close 
20110108224609.000|20110108224611.000|TR0|to someone, but if you can repeat what you 
20110108224611.000|20110108224614.000|TR0|said. What does it take to carry out 
20110108224614.000|20110108224617.000|TR0|something like this?
20110108224617.000|20110108224620.000|TR0|
20110108224620.000|20110108224622.000|TR0|DIETZ:  It takes being paranoid and 
20110108224622.000|20110108224625.000|TR0|suicidal -- (AUDIO PROBLEM).

20110108224628.000|20110108224631.000|TR0|And this young man has, on web sites 
20110108224631.000|20110108224633.000|TR0|attributed to him, information indicating 
20110108224633.000|20110108224636.000|TR0|that his favorite book is "Mein Kampf" and 
20110108224636.000|20110108224639.000|TR0|various more conventional utopian novels.  
20110108224639.000|20110108224641.000|TR0|He has concerns that his own civil rights 
20110108224641.000|20110108224644.000|TR0|are being violated.  He has concerns about 
20110108224644.000|20110108224647.000|TR0|their being a new currency introduced, all 
20110108224647.000|20110108224650.000|TR0|of which suggests that there's something 
20110108224650.000|20110108224652.000|TR0|quite wrong with his thinking.  And the 
20110108224652.000|20110108224655.000|TR0|good news from that is that would mean he 
20110108224655.000|20110108224658.000|TR0|would be a lone assailant.

20110108224706.000|20110108224709.000|TR0|DIETZ:  Yes.  That's the common age of 
20110108224709.000|20110108224711.000|TR0|onset of one of the most serious mental 
20110108224711.000|20110108224714.000|TR0|illnesses that would be characterized by 
20110108224714.000|20110108224717.000|TR0|paranoia and concerns about global 
20110108224717.000|20110108224720.000|TR0|important conspiracies and issues.  I 
20110108224720.000|20110108224722.000|TR0|think, when all is said and done, we'll 
20110108224722.000|20110108224725.000|TR0|learn he had the onset of that illness.

20110108224730.000|20110108224733.000|TR0|Do you see -- already see similarities to 
20110108224733.000|20110108224736.000|TR0|cases that you've worked on in the past to 
20110108224736.000|20110108224739.000|TR0|this one?

20110108224741.000|20110108224744.000|TR0|DIETZ:  Well, we don't know enough about 
20110108224744.000|20110108224747.000|TR0|him yet to be sure.  But I can tell you 
20110108224747.000|20110108224749.000|TR0|that mass murderers and assassins have in 
20110108224749.000|20110108224752.000|TR0|common the idea that they will find their 
20110108224752.000|20110108224755.000|TR0|place in history and that they are doing 
20110108224755.000|20110108224758.000|TR0|something that brings about a correction 
20110108224758.000|20110108224800.000|TR0|to --

20110108224806.000|20110108224808.000|TR0|to interrupt you.

20110108224825.000|20110108224828.000|TR0|thoughts are with all of them, all of 
20110108224828.000|20110108224830.000|TR0|their families. Congresswoman Giffords is 
20110108224830.000|20110108224833.000|TR0|a great patriotic American, a 
20110108224833.000|20110108224836.000|TR0|representative of Congress, of a new 
20110108224836.000|20110108224838.000|TR0|generation of leaders, brilliant, 
20110108224838.000|20110108224841.000|TR0|patriotic. Her husband is a Navy captain 
20110108224841.000|20110108224844.000|TR0|who was on the "Endeavor" space flight. 
20110108224844.000|20110108224847.000|TR0|Her brother-in-law is in space right now.  
20110108224847.000|20110108224849.000|TR0|And so their commitment to our country is 
20110108224849.000|20110108224852.000|TR0|a great one.

20110108224855.000|20110108224857.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords is a strong 
20110108224857.000|20110108224900.000|TR0|fighter, and the news, as it goes by in 
20110108224900.000|20110108224903.000|TR0|the day, has improved in terms of her 
20110108224903.000|20110108224906.000|TR0|condition.  We're all very prayerful as we 
20110108224906.000|20110108224908.000|TR0|learn more.

20110108224911.000|20110108224914.000|TR0|However, there is some loss of life, and 
20110108224914.000|20110108224917.000|TR0|for that I want all of you to join 
20110108224917.000|20110108224919.000|TR0|Congresswoman Barbara (INAUDIBLE), 
20110108224919.000|20110108224922.000|TR0|Congressman (INAUDIBLE) for a moment of

20110108224933.000|20110108224936.000|TR0|prayers.  But also, as I thank all of you, 
20110108224936.000|20110108224938.000|TR0|my constituents, let us join in prayer

20110108225216.000|20110108225219.000|TR0|among our Congress people as they get word

20110108225227.000|20110108225230.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Don, I just spoke with the 
20110108225230.000|20110108225233.000|TR0|Senate sergeant at arms.  He is the man 
20110108225233.000|20110108225235.000|TR0|who is in charge, effectively in charge of 
20110108225235.000|20110108225238.000|TR0|all security for Senators.  Obviously, 
20110108225238.000|20110108225241.000|TR0|Gabby Giffords is a member of the House, 
20110108225241.000|20110108225243.000|TR0|not the Senate, but this is very 
20110108225243.000|20110108225246.000|TR0|interesting what he said to me.  He said 
20110108225246.000|20110108225249.000|TR0|-- this is Terry Gainer, sergeant at arms. 
20110108225249.000|20110108225252.000|TR0| He said that threats to members of the 
20110108225252.000|20110108225254.000|TR0|Senate, at least, had been very low of 
20110108225254.000|20110108225257.000|TR0|late.  They said they have not been high. 
20110108225257.000|20110108225300.000|TR0|He said he gets briefings very, very 
20110108225300.000|20110108225302.000|TR0|frequently and he has been struck by how 
20110108225302.000|20110108225305.000|TR0|low they are.
20110108225305.000|20110108225308.000|TR0|
20110108225308.000|20110108225311.000|TR0|He also said to me that when it comes to 
20110108225311.000|20110108225313.000|TR0|the gunman that we have been reporting on, 
20110108225313.000|20110108225316.000|TR0|he said, it appears to be an isolated 
20110108225316.000|20110108225319.000|TR0|incident. Underlying appears, because, as 
20110108225319.000|20110108225322.000|TR0|we all know, that initial information when 
20110108225322.000|20110108225324.000|TR0|it comes to horrible tragedies like this 
20110108225324.000|20110108225327.000|TR0|tend to change, but that is his initial 
20110108225327.000|20110108225330.000|TR0|information.
20110108225330.000|20110108225332.000|TR0|
20110108225332.000|20110108225335.000|TR0|We have reached out to the House sergeant 
20110108225335.000|20110108225338.000|TR0|of arms, Bill Livingood, but we have not 
20110108225338.000|20110108225341.000|TR0|heard back from his office.
20110108225341.000|20110108225343.000|TR0|
20110108225343.000|20110108225346.000|TR0|But I thought that was noteworthy to hear 
20110108225346.000|20110108225349.000|TR0|from at least the man in charge of the 
20110108225349.000|20110108225351.000|TR0|Senate security, that it doesn't uptick at 
20110108225351.000|20110108225354.000|TR0|all, that this does appear to be at least 
20110108225354.000|20110108225357.000|TR0|initially one man who was, for whatever 
20110108225357.000|20110108225400.000|TR0|reason, focused on this one area and 
20110108225400.000|20110108225402.000|TR0|perhaps this one member.
20110108225402.000|20110108225405.000|TR0|
20110108225405.000|20110108225408.000|TR0|LEMON:  Yes.  Republican Arizona 
20110108225408.000|20110108225411.000|TR0|Congressman Trent Franks said to -- 
20110108225411.000|20110108225413.000|TR0|relayed the same sentiments to me on the 
20110108225413.000|20110108225416.000|TR0|air just moments ago.  And he said we, 
20110108225416.000|20110108225419.000|TR0|here in the news business, like to -- we 
20110108225419.000|20110108225421.000|TR0|want to dig and figure out what's going 
20110108225421.000|20110108225424.000|TR0|on.  He said it's premature to wonder if 
20110108225424.000|20110108225427.000|TR0|it's the mood or what it is.  We should be 
20110108225427.000|20110108225430.000|TR0|thinking more about these people who are 
20110108225430.000|20110108225432.000|TR0|in the hospital and those who have died.
20110108225432.000|20110108225435.000|TR0|
20110108225435.000|20110108225438.000|TR0|BASH:  That's very true.  That's very 
20110108225438.000|20110108225440.000|TR0|true.  We should also note -- and you and 
20110108225440.000|20110108225443.000|TR0|I talked about this earlier -- that we've 
20110108225443.000|20110108225446.000|TR0|also heard from other members of Congress 
20110108225446.000|20110108225449.000|TR0|who have said, regardless of the 
20110108225449.000|20110108225451.000|TR0|motivation, regardless of whether it's 
20110108225451.000|20110108225454.000|TR0|related to the atmosphere in politics or 
20110108225454.000|20110108225457.000|TR0|not, that when it comes to members of 
20110108225457.000|20110108225500.000|TR0|Congress and them doing their job, that 
20110108225500.000|20110108225502.000|TR0|this could have an initial chilling effect 
20110108225502.000|20110108225505.000|TR0|on just the idea of whether or not it's a 
20110108225505.000|20110108225508.000|TR0|good idea to go out and have a town hall 
20110108225508.000|20110108225510.000|TR0|or have a "Congress on your Corner," as 
20110108225510.000|20110108225513.000|TR0|Gabby Giffords was doing.  I can't 
20110108225513.000|20110108225516.000|TR0|imagine, at least, the way that members of 
20110108225516.000|20110108225519.000|TR0|Congress will proceed is not going to be 
20110108225519.000|20110108225521.000|TR0|reassessed in the future.
20110108225521.000|20110108225524.000|TR0|
20110108225524.000|20110108225527.000|TR0|LEMON:  Yes, one Congressman said this is 
20110108225527.000|20110108225529.000|TR0|definitely a wake-up call.
20110108225529.000|20110108225532.000|TR0|
20110108225532.000|20110108225535.000|TR0|Dana Bash, thank you very much.  Please 
20110108225535.000|20110108225538.000|TR0|stand by.
20110108225538.000|20110108225540.000|TR0|
20110108225540.000|20110108225543.000|TR0|We're learning more about the suspected 
20110108225543.000|20110108225546.000|TR0|gunman here.  His name is Jared Lee 
20110108225546.000|20110108225549.000|TR0|Loughner.  He is 22 years old.  He's in 
20110108225549.000|20110108225551.000|TR0|custody.  I'm going to talk to Park Dietz 
20110108225551.000|20110108225554.000|TR0|about this.  He knows all about this, 
20110108225554.000|20110108225557.000|TR0|handled some very high-profile cases that 
20110108225557.000|20110108225559.000|TR0|are similar to this one.  That's next.

20110108225602.000|20110108225605.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110108225605.000|20110108225608.000|TR0|
20110108225608.000|20110108225610.000|TR0|LEMON:  Want to update some breaking news 
20110108225610.000|20110108225613.000|TR0|for you.  It is out of Tucson, Arizona, 
20110108225613.000|20110108225616.000|TR0|and it is horrible.  It happened this 
20110108225616.000|20110108225618.000|TR0|morning.  Take a look at this picture.  
20110108225618.000|20110108225621.000|TR0|This is Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. 
20110108225621.000|20110108225624.000|TR0|This is the scene of where it happened, 
20110108225624.000|20110108225627.000|TR0|that Safeway store in Tucson, Arizona, 
20110108225627.000|20110108225629.000|TR0|where she was holding a meeting, a meet 
20110108225629.000|20110108225632.000|TR0|and greet with constituents when a gunman 
20110108225632.000|20110108225635.000|TR0|walked up, shot her at close range.  She 
20110108225635.000|20110108225638.000|TR0|is in the hospital now, out of surgery.  
20110108225638.000|20110108225640.000|TR0|Doctors are saying it's optimistic.  She's 
20110108225640.000|20110108225643.000|TR0|in ICU right now.
20110108225643.000|20110108225646.000|TR0|
20110108225646.000|20110108225648.000|TR0|Also a judge was killed as well.  The 
20110108225648.000|20110108225651.000|TR0|judge is John M. Roll.  He's a federal 
20110108225651.000|20110108225654.000|TR0|judge.  And he was killed in that as well 
20110108225654.000|20110108225657.000|TR0|-- as well as a 9- year-old child killed 
20110108225657.000|20110108225659.000|TR0|here.
20110108225659.000|20110108225702.000|TR0|
20110108225702.000|20110108225705.000|TR0|We're learning new information now about 
20110108225705.000|20110108225707.000|TR0|the person they believe is responsible for 
20110108225707.000|20110108225710.000|TR0|this.  The president has sent the FBI 
20110108225710.000|20110108225713.000|TR0|director there to take care of it.  We saw 
20110108225713.000|20110108225716.000|TR0|the FBI on the ground moments ago, looking 
20110108225716.000|20110108225718.000|TR0|for clues as well.
20110108225718.000|20110108225721.000|TR0|
20110108225721.000|20110108225724.000|TR0|Let's talk about this 22-year-old named 
20110108225724.000|20110108225727.000|TR0|Jared Lee Loughner.  Jared Lee Loughner, 
20110108225727.000|20110108225729.000|TR0|that's the suspect here.
20110108225729.000|20110108225732.000|TR0|
20110108225732.000|20110108225735.000|TR0|Park Dietz is a criminologist and he has 
20110108225735.000|20110108225737.000|TR0|handled cases and has had to deal with 
20110108225737.000|20110108225740.000|TR0|people who you believe, with this young 
20110108225740.000|20110108225743.000|TR0|man -- we don't his motivation know, Mr. 
20110108225743.000|20110108225746.000|TR0|Dietz, but you believe that he has some 
20110108225746.000|20110108225748.000|TR0|sort of psychological disorder that would 
20110108225748.000|20110108225751.000|TR0|lead him to do this.
20110108225751.000|20110108225754.000|TR0|
20110108225754.000|20110108225756.000|TR0|DIETZ:  Well, I'm a forensic psychiatrist. 
20110108225756.000|20110108225759.000|TR0| And the cases I see that involve either 
20110108225759.000|20110108225802.000|TR0|mass murder or public-figure attacks 
20110108225802.000|20110108225805.000|TR0|invariably involves some kind of mental 
20110108225805.000|20110108225807.000|TR0|disorder.  And the clues on the web sites 
20110108225807.000|20110108225810.000|TR0|that seem to be those of Jared Loughner, 
20110108225810.000|20110108225813.000|TR0|give ample evidence that his thinking is 
20110108225813.000|20110108225816.000|TR0|not right, that he's paranoid, that he 
20110108225816.000|20110108225818.000|TR0|believes there are conspiracies to 
20110108225818.000|20110108225821.000|TR0|introduce a new currency, that his civil 
20110108225821.000|20110108225824.000|TR0|rights are being violated.  And like the 
20110108225824.000|20110108225826.000|TR0|Columbine shooters, he admires Adolf 
20110108225826.000|20110108225829.000|TR0|Hitler's work, "Mein Kampf."  People who 
20110108225829.000|20110108225832.000|TR0|do events like this -- and this is unique 
20110108225832.000|20110108225835.000|TR0|in being both a mass murderer and an 
20110108225835.000|20110108225837.000|TR0|assassination attempt -- have in mind 
20110108225837.000|20110108225840.000|TR0|correcting perceived injustice and marking 
20110108225840.000|20110108225843.000|TR0|their place in history.  They see this as 
20110108225843.000|20110108225845.000|TR0|a mission that fulfills some sense of 
20110108225845.000|20110108225848.000|TR0|destiny.  And that's the kind of viewpoint 
20110108225848.000|20110108225851.000|TR0|that no one else would endorse.  In other 
20110108225851.000|20110108225854.000|TR0|words, they don't surround themselves with 
20110108225854.000|20110108225856.000|TR0|admirers and friends who encourage them to 
20110108225856.000|20110108225859.000|TR0|do this.  They do this on their own 
20110108225859.000|20110108225902.000|TR0|because of their very distorted perception 
20110108225902.000|20110108225905.000|TR0|of the world.
20110108225905.000|20110108225907.000|TR0|
20110108225907.000|20110108225910.000|TR0|LEMON:  Listen, Mr. Dietz, alone, do you 
20110108225910.000|20110108225913.000|TR0|think he acted alone?  Do you think he had 
20110108225913.000|20110108225915.000|TR0|some sort of accomplice?  Too early to 
20110108225915.000|20110108225918.000|TR0|tell?
20110108225918.000|20110108225921.000|TR0|
20110108225921.000|20110108225924.000|TR0|DIETZ:  No, there won't be any accomplices 
20110108225924.000|20110108225926.000|TR0|here.  There may emerge some fans, who are 
20110108225926.000|20110108225929.000|TR0|equally distorted in their perception, but 
20110108225929.000|20110108225932.000|TR0|this is going to be the work of a lone 
20110108225932.000|20110108225934.000|TR0|gunman, who has tried to let the world 
20110108225934.000|20110108225937.000|TR0|know of his concerns in various ways.  
20110108225937.000|20110108225940.000|TR0|Sadly, often, the way they notify people 
20110108225940.000|20110108225943.000|TR0|of what they're thinking of doing, doesn't 
20110108225943.000|20110108225945.000|TR0|get in the hands of, in this instance, the 
20110108225945.000|20110108225948.000|TR0|capital police or the Marshal Service, 
20110108225948.000|20110108225951.000|TR0|because they're writing what seem to be 
20110108225951.000|20110108225954.000|TR0|wacky communications, making threats to 
20110108225954.000|20110108225956.000|TR0|other people instead of the eventual 
20110108225956.000|20110108225959.000|TR0|target victim.  It's difficult to read 
20110108225959.000|20110108230002.000|TR0|from these communications what they're 
20110108230002.000|20110108230004.000|TR0|actually up to, though everyone can see 
20110108230004.000|20110108230007.000|TR0|something's wrong.
20110108230007.000|20110108230010.000|TR0|
