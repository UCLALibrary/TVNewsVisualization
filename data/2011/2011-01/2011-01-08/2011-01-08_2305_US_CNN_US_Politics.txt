20110108231130.000|20110108231132.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  I'm sorry.  You had a little bit 
20110108231132.000|20110108231135.000|TR0|of a breakup.  That's why I just 
20110108231135.000|20110108231137.000|TR0|interrupted.  Go ahead, sir.

20110108231140.000|20110108231142.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well, that's the basic 
20110108231142.000|20110108231144.000|TR0|information I can provide you.  We are 
20110108231144.000|20110108231147.000|TR0|really working at dynamic incident here, 
20110108231147.000|20110108231149.000|TR0|as we have a number of witness and other 
20110108231149.000|20110108231152.000|TR0|victims who have self-reported their 
20110108231152.000|20110108231154.000|TR0|injuries, have shown up at up to four

20110108231201.000|20110108231204.000|TR0|certainly we're concerned about those who

20110108231228.000|20110108231231.000|TR0|CNN as Jared Lee Loughner.  We know that 
20110108231231.000|20110108231233.000|TR0|he is 22 years old.  He's a white male.

20110108231236.000|20110108231238.000|TR0|did this.  Police have also recovered a .9 
20110108231238.000|20110108231241.000|TR0|millimeter Glock handgun, but they haven't

20110108231250.000|20110108231253.000|TR0|when the mass shooting broke out.  She was 
20110108231253.000|20110108231255.000|TR0|representing the area where she was born.  
20110108231255.000|20110108231258.000|TR0|Here's some more on her background of 
20110108231258.000|20110108231300.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.  She was born in 1970 
20110108231300.000|20110108231303.000|TR0|and graduated from University High in 
20110108231303.000|20110108231305.000|TR0|Tucson and Scripps College.  She earned a 
20110108231305.000|20110108231307.000|TR0|Fulbright Scholarship to Mexico in 1996.  
20110108231307.000|20110108231310.000|TR0|She was elected as a Democrat to the 
20110108231310.000|20110108231312.000|TR0|Arizona house in 2001 and served in the 
20110108231312.000|20110108231315.000|TR0|state legislature through 2005.  Then in 
20110108231315.000|20110108231317.000|TR0|2006 she won a seat in the U.S. House of

20110108231322.000|20110108231324.000|TR0|Her official Website proclaims Giffords as 
20110108231324.000|20110108231327.000|TR0|one of the most centrist lawmakers in 
20110108231327.000|20110108231329.000|TR0|Congress.  Concentrated on deficit 
20110108231329.000|20110108231332.000|TR0|reduction and promoting business, that is 
20110108231332.000|20110108231334.000|TR0|according to her Web site.

20110108231411.000|20110108231413.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110108231413.000|20110108231416.000|TR0|STATES:  A number of people were shot in 
20110108231416.000|20110108231418.000|TR0|Tucson, Arizona, including several who 
20110108231418.000|20110108231421.000|TR0|were meeting at a supermarket with their 
20110108231421.000|20110108231423.000|TR0|Congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords. We are 
20110108231423.000|20110108231426.000|TR0|still assembling all the facts.  But we 
20110108231426.000|20110108231428.000|TR0|know that Representative Giffords was one 
20110108231428.000|20110108231430.000|TR0|of the victims.  She's currently at a 
20110108231430.000|20110108231433.000|TR0|hospital in the area and she's battling 
20110108231433.000|20110108231435.000|TR0|for her life.  We also know that at least 
20110108231435.000|20110108231438.000|TR0|five people lost their lives in this 
20110108231438.000|20110108231440.000|TR0|tragedy.

20110108231443.000|20110108231445.000|TR0|Among them were a federal judge, John 
20110108231445.000|20110108231447.000|TR0|Roll, who has served America's legal 
20110108231447.000|20110108231450.000|TR0|system for almost 40 years; and a young 
20110108231450.000|20110108231452.000|TR0|girl, who was barely nine years old.

20110108231455.000|20110108231457.000|TR0|I have spoken to Arizona Governor Jan 
20110108231457.000|20110108231500.000|TR0|Brewer, and offered the full resources of 
20110108231500.000|20110108231502.000|TR0|the federal government.  A suspect is 
20110108231502.000|20110108231505.000|TR0|currently in custody, but we don't yet 
20110108231505.000|20110108231507.000|TR0|know what provoked this unspeakable act.  
20110108231507.000|20110108231509.000|TR0|A comprehensive investigation is underway, 
20110108231509.000|20110108231512.000|TR0|and at my direction, Director Bob Mueller 
20110108231512.000|20110108231514.000|TR0|is en route to Arizona to help coordinate 
20110108231514.000|20110108231517.000|TR0|these efforts.

20110108231519.000|20110108231522.000|TR0|I've also spoken to the Democratic and 
20110108231522.000|20110108231524.000|TR0|Republican leaders in the House.  Gabby 
20110108231524.000|20110108231527.000|TR0|Giffords was a friend of mine.  She's not 
20110108231527.000|20110108231529.000|TR0|only an extraordinary public servant, but 
20110108231529.000|20110108231531.000|TR0|she's also somebody who is warm and 
20110108231531.000|20110108231534.000|TR0|caring.  She is well liked by her 
20110108231534.000|20110108231536.000|TR0|colleagues, and well liked by her 
20110108231536.000|20110108231539.000|TR0|constituents.  Her husband, Mark Kelly, is 
20110108231539.000|20110108231541.000|TR0|a Navy captain, and one of America's 
20110108231541.000|20110108231544.000|TR0|valiant astronauts.
20110108231544.000|20110108231546.000|TR0|
20110108231546.000|20110108231549.000|TR0|It's not surprising that today Gabby was 
20110108231549.000|20110108231551.000|TR0|doing what she always does, listening to 
20110108231551.000|20110108231553.000|TR0|the hopes and concerns of her neighbors.  
20110108231553.000|20110108231556.000|TR0|That is the essence of what our democracy 
20110108231556.000|20110108231558.000|TR0|is all about.  That is why this is more 
20110108231558.000|20110108231601.000|TR0|than a tragedy for those involved.  It is 
20110108231601.000|20110108231603.000|TR0|a tragedy for Arizona, and a tragedy for 
20110108231603.000|20110108231606.000|TR0|our entire country.
20110108231606.000|20110108231608.000|TR0|
20110108231608.000|20110108231610.000|TR0|What Americans do at times of tragedy is 
20110108231610.000|20110108231613.000|TR0|to come together and support each other.  
20110108231613.000|20110108231615.000|TR0|So at this time I ask all Americans to 
20110108231615.000|20110108231618.000|TR0|join me and Michelle in keeping all the 
20110108231618.000|20110108231620.000|TR0|victims, and their families, including 
20110108231620.000|20110108231623.000|TR0|Gabby, in our thoughts and prayers.  Those 
20110108231623.000|20110108231625.000|TR0|who have been injured we are rooting for 
20110108231625.000|20110108231628.000|TR0|them.  And I know Gabby is as tough as 
20110108231628.000|20110108231630.000|TR0|they come.  And I am hopeful that she's 
20110108231630.000|20110108231632.000|TR0|going to pull through.
20110108231632.000|20110108231635.000|TR0|
20110108231635.000|20110108231637.000|TR0|Obviously, our hearts go out to the family 
20110108231637.000|20110108231640.000|TR0|members of those who have been slain.  We 
20110108231640.000|20110108231642.000|TR0|are going to get to the bottom of this.  
20110108231642.000|20110108231645.000|TR0|And we're going to get through this.  But 
20110108231645.000|20110108231647.000|TR0|in the meantime, I think all of us need to 
20110108231647.000|20110108231650.000|TR0|make sure that with we're offering our 
20110108231650.000|20110108231652.000|TR0|thoughts and prayers to those concerned.

20110108231746.000|20110108231748.000|TR0|presided as Giffords was sworn in for 
20110108231748.000|20110108231751.000|TR0|third term from Arizona's Eighth District. 
20110108231751.000|20110108231753.000|TR0| She won re-election in November in a 
20110108231753.000|20110108231755.000|TR0|close race, over a Tea Party candidate.
20110108231755.000|20110108231758.000|TR0|
20110108231758.000|20110108231800.000|TR0|Let's talk more about the Tea Party.  Just 
20110108231800.000|20110108231803.000|TR0|got a response from them. They put out a 
20110108231803.000|20110108231805.000|TR0|statement just a short time ago.  Here's 
20110108231805.000|20110108231808.000|TR0|what it says.
20110108231808.000|20110108231810.000|TR0|
20110108231810.000|20110108231813.000|TR0|It says, "We at the Tea Party Express are 
20110108231813.000|20110108231815.000|TR0|shocked and saddened to hear about the 
20110108231815.000|20110108231817.000|TR0|terrible tragedy that took place in Tucson 
20110108231817.000|20110108231820.000|TR0|today.  It is appalling that anyone would 
20110108231820.000|20110108231822.000|TR0|commit such unthinkable violence against 
20110108231822.000|20110108231825.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, her 
20110108231825.000|20110108231827.000|TR0|staff, a sitting federal judge, and the 
20110108231827.000|20110108231830.000|TR0|many other victims and families impacted.  
20110108231830.000|20110108231832.000|TR0|These heinous crimes have no place in 
20110108231832.000|20110108231834.000|TR0|America and they are especially grievous 
20110108231834.000|20110108231837.000|TR0|when committed against our elected 
20110108231837.000|20110108231839.000|TR0|officials.  Spirited debate is desirable 
20110108231839.000|20110108231842.000|TR0|in our country, but it only should be the 
20110108231842.000|20110108231844.000|TR0|clash of ideas."
20110108231844.000|20110108231847.000|TR0|
20110108231847.000|20110108231849.000|TR0|So and then it goes on, more of the same 
20110108231849.000|20110108231852.000|TR0|sentiment.  Again, that is from the Tea 
20110108231852.000|20110108231854.000|TR0|Party Express.
20110108231854.000|20110108231856.000|TR0|
20110108231856.000|20110108231859.000|TR0|Listen, I want to go to Doug Wilson.  He 
20110108231859.000|20110108231901.000|TR0|is joining us by phone right now.  He's a 
20110108231901.000|20110108231904.000|TR0|Defense Department official and a close 
20110108231904.000|20110108231906.000|TR0|friend of Representative Giffords.
20110108231906.000|20110108231909.000|TR0|
20110108231909.000|20110108231911.000|TR0|How are you doing?
20110108231911.000|20110108231914.000|TR0|
20110108231914.000|20110108231916.000|TR0|DOUG WILSON, OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS, 
20110108231916.000|20110108231918.000|TR0|PENTAGON:  Well, thank you, under the 
20110108231918.000|20110108231921.000|TR0|circumstances.
20110108231921.000|20110108231923.000|TR0|
20110108231923.000|20110108231926.000|TR0|LEMON:  Have you heard from the family?
20110108231926.000|20110108231928.000|TR0|
20110108231928.000|20110108231931.000|TR0|WILSON:  No, but there are an awful lot of 
20110108231931.000|20110108231933.000|TR0|us who are from Arizona who are based here 
20110108231933.000|20110108231936.000|TR0|in Washington, who have been trying to 
20110108231936.000|20110108231938.000|TR0|exchange news and keeping in touch.  And 
20110108231938.000|20110108231940.000|TR0|we've obviously been watching you and all 
20110108231940.000|20110108231943.000|TR0|of the stations to keep posted.
20110108231943.000|20110108231945.000|TR0|
20110108231945.000|20110108231948.000|TR0|LEMON:  Yeah.  What do you make of all of 
20110108231948.000|20110108231950.000|TR0|this, sir?
20110108231950.000|20110108231953.000|TR0|
20110108231953.000|20110108231955.000|TR0|WILSON:  This is a huge shock.  Gabby 
20110108231955.000|20110108231957.000|TR0|Giffords is -- comes from a pioneering 
20110108231957.000|20110108232000.000|TR0|family in Tucson.  She is one of the most 
20110108232000.000|20110108232002.000|TR0|vibrant, friendly outgoing people in the 
20110108232002.000|20110108232005.000|TR0|community.  And regardless of where you 
20110108232005.000|20110108232007.000|TR0|sit on the political spectrum, you can't 
20110108232007.000|20110108232010.000|TR0|help but just be absolutely shocked and 
20110108232010.000|20110108232012.000|TR0|appalled by what has happened.  And of 
20110108232012.000|20110108232015.000|TR0|course, a lot of us are waiting to find 
20110108232015.000|20110108232017.000|TR0|out the conditions of others who have been 
20110108232017.000|20110108232019.000|TR0|injured here.  Many of her staff are 
20110108232019.000|20110108232022.000|TR0|friends.  We don't know the updates and 
20110108232022.000|20110108232024.000|TR0|their conditions.
20110108232024.000|20110108232027.000|TR0|
20110108232027.000|20110108232029.000|TR0|LEMON:  And so waiting by the phone and 
20110108232029.000|20110108232032.000|TR0|hearing you guys, I'm sure, obviously 
20110108232032.000|20110108232034.000|TR0|shocking.  When did you find out?  And how?
20110108232034.000|20110108232037.000|TR0|
20110108232037.000|20110108232039.000|TR0|WILSON:  I was notified by my senior 
20110108232039.000|20110108232041.000|TR0|military assistant.  I work in the office 
20110108232041.000|20110108232044.000|TR0|of -- I head the office of public affairs 
20110108232044.000|20110108232046.000|TR0|at the Pentagon. I was called earlier this 
20110108232046.000|20110108232049.000|TR0|afternoon and went straight to the 
20110108232049.000|20110108232051.000|TR0|television, and have been locked there and 
20110108232051.000|20110108232054.000|TR0|on the telephone ever since.  LEMON:  As 
20110108232054.000|20110108232056.000|TR0|someone who works for the Defense 
20110108232056.000|20110108232059.000|TR0|Department, and you have this platform now 
20110108232059.000|20110108232101.000|TR0|where people are watching and listening to 
20110108232101.000|20110108232103.000|TR0|you, do you have a message, something you 
20110108232103.000|20110108232106.000|TR0|want to say to the folks watching?
20110108232106.000|20110108232108.000|TR0|
20110108232108.000|20110108232111.000|TR0|WILSON:  Gabby Giffords is somebody who 
20110108232111.000|20110108232113.000|TR0|was a strong supporter of our men and 
20110108232113.000|20110108232116.000|TR0|women in uniform.  In fact, she married 
20110108232116.000|20110108232118.000|TR0|one of them.  A Navy captain, Mark Kelly.  
20110108232118.000|20110108232120.000|TR0|This is a tragedy.  And all I can say is 
20110108232120.000|20110108232123.000|TR0|the only piece of good news so far was the 
20110108232123.000|20110108232125.000|TR0|report from the surgeon that he was 
20110108232125.000|20110108232128.000|TR0|optimistic about her recovery.  And all of 
20110108232128.000|20110108232130.000|TR0|us are praying she's going to pull through 
20110108232130.000|20110108232133.000|TR0|and all of us are anxiously awaiting to 
20110108232133.000|20110108232135.000|TR0|find out the status of the others who were 
20110108232135.000|20110108232138.000|TR0|injured.
20110108232138.000|20110108232140.000|TR0|
20110108232140.000|20110108232142.000|TR0|LEMON:  Doug Wilson is a Defense 
20110108232142.000|20110108232145.000|TR0|Department official and a friend of 
20110108232145.000|20110108232147.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.  Thank you, sir.

20110108232150.000|20110108232152.000|TR0|Up next, here on CNN, our Chief Medical 
20110108232152.000|20110108232155.000|TR0|Correspondent Doctor Sanjay Gupta, a 
20110108232155.000|20110108232157.000|TR0|practicing neurosurgeon, himself, is going 
20110108232157.000|20110108232200.000|TR0|to tell us how doctors are treating 
20110108232200.000|20110108232202.000|TR0|representative Giffords.
20110108232202.000|20110108232204.000|TR0|
20110108232204.000|20110108232207.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110108232207.000|20110108232209.000|TR0|
20110108232209.000|20110108232212.000|TR0|LEMON:  Don Lemon at the CNN World 
20110108232212.000|20110108232214.000|TR0|Headquarters in Atlanta.  We are 
20110108232214.000|20110108232217.000|TR0|continuing to follow this breaking news 
20110108232217.000|20110108232219.000|TR0|for you.  Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords 
20110108232219.000|20110108232222.000|TR0|is fighting for her life right now.  After 
20110108232222.000|20110108232224.000|TR0|a mass shooting at a Tucson, Arizona, 
20110108232224.000|20110108232226.000|TR0|grocery store.  She's one of 18 people 
20110108232226.000|20110108232229.000|TR0|gunned down this morning.  Six people were 
20110108232229.000|20110108232231.000|TR0|killed, including Federal Judge John Roll, 
20110108232231.000|20110108232234.000|TR0|and a nine-year-old girl.
20110108232234.000|20110108232236.000|TR0|
20110108232236.000|20110108232239.000|TR0|Police do have a suspect in custody.  He's 
20110108232239.000|20110108232241.000|TR0|identified as 22-year-old Jared Lee 
20110108232241.000|20110108232243.000|TR0|Loughner.  They've also recovered a 
20110108232243.000|20110108232246.000|TR0|handgun, a .9 millimeter Glock.  No word 
20110108232246.000|20110108232248.000|TR0|yet on a motive.
20110108232248.000|20110108232251.000|TR0|
20110108232251.000|20110108232253.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords was holding a 
20110108232253.000|20110108232256.000|TR0|constituent meeting at that store.  She 
20110108232256.000|20110108232258.000|TR0|suffered a gunshot to the head and is 
20110108232258.000|20110108232301.000|TR0|listed in critical condition.  Doctors say 
20110108232301.000|20110108232303.000|TR0|they are optimistic about her recovery. 
20110108232303.000|20110108232305.000|TR0|Witnesses talked about how the gunman shot 
20110108232305.000|20110108232308.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords at pointblank range, 
20110108232308.000|20110108232310.000|TR0|and yet her surgeon is optimistic she will 
20110108232310.000|20110108232313.000|TR0|recover after being shot in the head.
20110108232313.000|20110108232315.000|TR0|
20110108232315.000|20110108232318.000|TR0|Our chief medical correspondent here at 
20110108232318.000|20110108232320.000|TR0|CNN, of course, is Doctor Sanjay Gupta.
20110108232320.000|20110108232323.000|TR0|
20110108232323.000|20110108232325.000|TR0|You're a neurosurgeon.  You know all about 
20110108232325.000|20110108232327.000|TR0|this.  Shot that close with a .9 
20110108232327.000|20110108232330.000|TR0|millimeter.  What are the odds here of 
20110108232330.000|20110108232332.000|TR0|surviving?  And for doctors to be 
20110108232332.000|20110108232335.000|TR0|optimistic, that's saying, that's saying a 
20110108232335.000|20110108232337.000|TR0|lot.
20110108232337.000|20110108232340.000|TR0|
20110108232340.000|20110108232342.000|TR0|DOCTOR SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL 
20110108232342.000|20110108232345.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  That's saying a lot.  They 
20110108232345.000|20110108232347.000|TR0|have a lot more information now.  
20110108232347.000|20110108232349.000|TR0|Obviously at the time someone is shot, you 
20110108232349.000|20110108232352.000|TR0|know, you're sort of collecting 
20110108232352.000|20110108232354.000|TR0|information, trying to see exactly where 
20110108232354.000|20110108232357.000|TR0|the bullet hit.  How much penetration 
20110108232357.000|20110108232359.000|TR0|there was.  Was this more of a glancing 
20110108232359.000|20110108232402.000|TR0|shot, or was it something that penetrated 
20110108232402.000|20110108232404.000|TR0|deep into the brain?  Sometimes it can 
20110108232404.000|20110108232406.000|TR0|cross from one side of the brain to the 
20110108232406.000|20110108232409.000|TR0|other.  These are all sort of important 
20110108232409.000|20110108232411.000|TR0|things that people collect in terms of 
20110108232411.000|20110108232414.000|TR0|data at the time.
20110108232414.000|20110108232416.000|TR0|
20110108232416.000|20110108232419.000|TR0|LEMON:  I heard you say something, and I 
20110108232419.000|20110108232421.000|TR0|heard during the press conference that she 
20110108232421.000|20110108232424.000|TR0|was obeying commands.  Listening to 
20110108232424.000|20110108232426.000|TR0|commands. What might it be like?  What 
20110108232426.000|20110108232428.000|TR0|might they be telling her?  Move your --
20110108232428.000|20110108232431.000|TR0|
20110108232431.000|20110108232433.000|TR0|GUPTA:  They might say something like, 
20110108232433.000|20110108232436.000|TR0|raise two fingers, or something like that, 
20110108232436.000|20110108232438.000|TR0|to really get an idea, is she able to 
20110108232438.000|20110108232441.000|TR0|hear?  Is she able to process that 
20110108232441.000|20110108232443.000|TR0|information?  And then able to execute a 
20110108232443.000|20110108232446.000|TR0|command based on that.  And obviously if 
20110108232446.000|20110108232448.000|TR0|she can do all those things, that's a real 
20110108232448.000|20110108232450.000|TR0|-- it tells you a lot if someone can 
20110108232450.000|20110108232453.000|TR0|follow commands, and it's one of the first 
20110108232453.000|20110108232455.000|TR0|things you check when someone comes out of 
20110108232455.000|20110108232458.000|TR0|the operating room.
20110108232458.000|20110108232500.000|TR0|
20110108232500.000|20110108232503.000|TR0|They go there, she goes to the hospital, 
20110108232503.000|20110108232505.000|TR0|probably got a CAT scan. Goes to the 
20110108232505.000|20110108232508.000|TR0|operating room, has the surgery.  Now 
20110108232508.000|20110108232510.000|TR0|everyone's sort of trying to figure out 
20110108232510.000|20110108232512.000|TR0|how well is she going to do?  That obeying 
20110108232512.000|20110108232515.000|TR0|command thing is a very important and good 
20110108232515.000|20110108232517.000|TR0|sign in the initial aftermath.
20110108232517.000|20110108232520.000|TR0|
20110108232520.000|20110108232522.000|TR0|LEMON:  Walk us through this, Doctor, if 
20110108232522.000|20110108232525.000|TR0|you're there and treating someone who 
20110108232525.000|20110108232527.000|TR0|comes in with a gunshot wound like that.  
20110108232527.000|20110108232529.000|TR0|What's the first thing that happens when 
20110108232529.000|20110108232532.000|TR0|they get to the ER?
20110108232532.000|20110108232534.000|TR0|
20110108232534.000|20110108232537.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, the first thing you want to 
20110108232537.000|20110108232539.000|TR0|do is you do a neurological exam.  You 
20110108232539.000|20110108232542.000|TR0|want to get some idea how significant was 
20110108232542.000|20110108232544.000|TR0|this injury?  In some cases as you alluded 
20110108232544.000|20110108232547.000|TR0|to it can be catastrophic.  Those cases 
20110108232547.000|20110108232549.000|TR0|surgery just may not help at all.  If 
20110108232549.000|20110108232551.000|TR0|there's some idea that, look, while 
20110108232551.000|20110108232554.000|TR0|there's been obviously a gunshot wound, 
20110108232554.000|20110108232556.000|TR0|the neurological impact is something that 
20110108232556.000|20110108232559.000|TR0|they think is salvageable, meaning, it 
20110108232559.000|20110108232601.000|TR0|could go to the operating room, and 
20110108232601.000|20110108232604.000|TR0|actually have some sort of recovery, then 
20110108232604.000|20110108232606.000|TR0|the patient will go to the operating room. 
20110108232606.000|20110108232609.000|TR0| They'll try to remove some of the 
20110108232609.000|20110108232611.000|TR0|bleeding in that area, take some of the 
20110108232611.000|20110108232613.000|TR0|pressure off the brain. That's really 
20110108232613.000|20110108232616.000|TR0|important.
20110108232616.000|20110108232618.000|TR0|
20110108232618.000|20110108232621.000|TR0|Then, you know, obviously get the patient 
20110108232621.000|20110108232623.000|TR0|to the intensive care unit as quickly as 
20110108232623.000|20110108232626.000|TR0|possible after that.  They do this 
20110108232626.000|20110108232628.000|TR0|neurological exam. Even though she may 
20110108232628.000|20110108232631.000|TR0|have a breathing tube in, she's obviously 
20110108232631.000|20110108232633.000|TR0|in critical condition after an operation 
20110108232633.000|20110108232635.000|TR0|like this.  But being able to do that 
20110108232635.000|20110108232638.000|TR0|neurological exam gives you a good 
20110108232638.000|20110108232640.000|TR0|prediction, how she's going to do sort of 
20110108232640.000|20110108232643.000|TR0|in the longer run.
20110108232643.000|20110108232645.000|TR0|
20110108232645.000|20110108232648.000|TR0|LEMON:  Depends on the severity of the 
20110108232648.000|20110108232650.000|TR0|injury as to how long the surgery is, 
20110108232650.000|20110108232652.000|TR0|correct?
20110108232652.000|20110108232655.000|TR0|
20110108232655.000|20110108232657.000|TR0|GUPTA:  How severe, how much of the bone, 
20110108232657.000|20110108232700.000|TR0|how much of the head was actually involved.
20110108232700.000|20110108232702.000|TR0|
20110108232702.000|20110108232705.000|TR0|LEMON:  So probably for her, I guess about 
20110108232705.000|20110108232707.000|TR0|four hours, because it happened around 
20110108232707.000|20110108232710.000|TR0|noon.  Then they held a press conference 
20110108232710.000|20110108232712.000|TR0|about 5:00, 5:30, saying that she was out 
20110108232712.000|20110108232714.000|TR0|of surgery and they were going to take her 
20110108232714.000|20110108232717.000|TR0|to ICU.  So probably about four hours.
20110108232717.000|20110108232719.000|TR0|
20110108232719.000|20110108232722.000|TR0|GUPTA:  That sounds about right, you know, 
20110108232722.000|20110108232724.000|TR0|get the patient to the hospital, they have 
20110108232724.000|20110108232727.000|TR0|to, obviously, do a CAT scan, they -- 
20110108232727.000|20110108232729.000|TR0|anesthesia is involved, getting the 
20110108232729.000|20110108232732.000|TR0|operating room ready.  The operation may 
20110108232732.000|20110108232734.000|TR0|be two to three hours.  That's about 
20110108232734.000|20110108232736.000|TR0|typical.
20110108232736.000|20110108232739.000|TR0|
20110108232739.000|20110108232741.000|TR0|LEMON:  That's about standard.  OK, time 
20110108232741.000|20110108232744.000|TR0|here, getting her to the hospital, getting 
20110108232744.000|20110108232746.000|TR0|her to the right place, and probably to 
20110108232746.000|20110108232749.000|TR0|the right facility that can treat her for 
20110108232749.000|20110108232751.000|TR0|this type of injury.  GUPTA:  Speed, 
20110108232751.000|20110108232753.000|TR0|obviously very important.  Obviously she 
20110108232753.000|20110108232756.000|TR0|got very, very quick care.  Very 
20110108232756.000|20110108232758.000|TR0|important.  She's relatively young.  We 
20110108232758.000|20110108232801.000|TR0|talked about this earlier.  That's going 
20110108232801.000|20110108232803.000|TR0|to work in her favor.  The type of injury, 
20110108232803.000|20110108232806.000|TR0|it sounds like it was a type of injury 
20110108232806.000|20110108232808.000|TR0|where the bullet actually passed into the 
20110108232808.000|20110108232811.000|TR0|area and then passed out, in and out type 
20110108232811.000|20110108232813.000|TR0|of an injury, they call it.
20110108232813.000|20110108232815.000|TR0|
20110108232815.000|20110108232818.000|TR0|LEMON:  Because at close range the chances 
20110108232818.000|20110108232820.000|TR0|are it would go out.  If you're shot from 
20110108232820.000|20110108232823.000|TR0|further away possibly it would not because 
20110108232823.000|20110108232825.000|TR0|of the trajectory of the bullet?  The 
20110108232825.000|20110108232828.000|TR0|velocity.
20110108232828.000|20110108232830.000|TR0|
20110108232830.000|20110108232833.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Right.  It's hard to say if 
20110108232833.000|20110108232835.000|TR0|someone ducked, for example, and you had 
20110108232835.000|20110108232837.000|TR0|sort of more of glancing shot.  That could 
20110108232837.000|20110108232840.000|TR0|also cause it to sort of go in and out 
20110108232840.000|20110108232842.000|TR0|over a very small area, for example, of 
20110108232842.000|20110108232845.000|TR0|the brain.  We don't know the answers to 
20110108232845.000|20110108232847.000|TR0|exactly what happened.  My sense is, 
20110108232847.000|20110108232850.000|TR0|again, you don't want to read too much -- 
20110108232850.000|20110108232852.000|TR0|the surgeons are usually pretty guarded 
20110108232852.000|20110108232855.000|TR0|especially immediately after an operation 
20110108232855.000|20110108232857.000|TR0|to predict things.  But based on the fact 
20110108232857.000|20110108232859.000|TR0|that she's following commands, based on 
20110108232859.000|20110108232902.000|TR0|the fact they came out and talked about 
20110108232902.000|20110108232904.000|TR0|that so early, this is as good of news as 
20110108232904.000|20110108232907.000|TR0|anybody could have expected in the 
20110108232907.000|20110108232909.000|TR0|aftermath of this.
20110108232909.000|20110108232912.000|TR0|
20110108232912.000|20110108232914.000|TR0|LEMON:  We're going to talk at some point 
20110108232914.000|20110108232916.000|TR0|tonight to someone who happens to be a 
20110108232916.000|20110108232919.000|TR0|friend, but is a representative in 
20110108232919.000|20110108232921.000|TR0|Arizona, knows the congresswoman-and is a 
20110108232921.000|20110108232924.000|TR0|doctor.  He called me and said, to have a 
20110108232924.000|20110108232926.000|TR0|neurosurgeon say optimistic, that's a good 
20110108232926.000|20110108232929.000|TR0|sign.  Because you guys, you like to -- 
20110108232929.000|20110108232931.000|TR0|you like to hedge a little bit.  You don't 
20110108232931.000|20110108232934.000|TR0|want to give false hope.
20110108232934.000|20110108232936.000|TR0|
20110108232936.000|20110108232938.000|TR0|GUPTA:  I think most neurosurgeons 
20110108232938.000|20110108232941.000|TR0|especially immediately after operation are 
20110108232941.000|20110108232943.000|TR0|going to hold their cards close to the 
20110108232943.000|20110108232946.000|TR0|vest there because there are so many 
20110108232946.000|20110108232948.000|TR0|variables here.  People say how could this 
20110108232948.000|20110108232951.000|TR0|happen?  That someone could get shot at 
20110108232951.000|20110108232953.000|TR0|close range and still, you know, be 
20110108232953.000|20110108232956.000|TR0|following commands afterwards?  It 
20110108232956.000|20110108232958.000|TR0|happens.  I wrote a paper about this a 
20110108232958.000|20110108233000.000|TR0|couple of years ago.  It can happen.  
20110108233000.000|20110108233003.000|TR0|There are so many variables that sort of 
20110108233003.000|20110108233005.000|TR0|dictate that.  Every single patient and 
20110108233005.000|20110108233008.000|TR0|every single injury is going to be so 
20110108233008.000|20110108233010.000|TR0|different.
20110108233010.000|20110108233013.000|TR0|
20110108233013.000|20110108233015.000|TR0|LEMON:  What's next for her?
20110108233015.000|20110108233018.000|TR0|
20110108233018.000|20110108233020.000|TR0|GUPTA:  These next day or two is very 
20110108233020.000|20110108233022.000|TR0|important.  She's going to be in the 
20110108233022.000|20110108233025.000|TR0|intensive care unit most likely.  And 
20110108233025.000|20110108233027.000|TR0|doing the same thing almost every hour.  
20110108233027.000|20110108233030.000|TR0|Can you follow some sort of command?  Hold 
20110108233030.000|20110108233032.000|TR0|up two fingers?  Open your eyes?  Move 
20110108233032.000|20110108233035.000|TR0|your right arm.  Move your left arm.
20110108233035.000|20110108233037.000|TR0|
20110108233037.000|20110108233039.000|TR0|LEMON:  If you were doing it, for me, if I 
20110108233039.000|20110108233042.000|TR0|came in, what would you say to me if I 
20110108233042.000|20110108233044.000|TR0|came in?  What kind of test would you do?
20110108233044.000|20110108233047.000|TR0|
20110108233047.000|20110108233049.000|TR0|GUPTA:  If you were in this position now, 
20110108233049.000|20110108233052.000|TR0|you'd likely have a breathing tube.  You 
20110108233052.000|20110108233054.000|TR0|wouldn't be able to talk.  You're not able 
20110108233054.000|20110108233057.000|TR0|to converse with me.  I'm trying to get an 
20110108233057.000|20110108233059.000|TR0|idea by saying, Don, can you hold up two 
20110108233059.000|20110108233101.000|TR0|fingers with this hand?  If you do that, 
20110108233101.000|20110108233104.000|TR0|that's a good sign.  The left side of your 
20110108233104.000|20110108233106.000|TR0|body is not weak, you're actually 
20110108233106.000|20110108233109.000|TR0|listening to me, processing that.  If I 
20110108233109.000|20110108233111.000|TR0|ask you to do the same thing on your right 
20110108233111.000|20110108233114.000|TR0|hand.  Shows me what your right side is 
20110108233114.000|20110108233116.000|TR0|doing.  Have you move your legs, your 
20110108233116.000|20110108233119.000|TR0|toes.  Again, not reflexive activity.  
20110108233119.000|20110108233121.000|TR0|Sometimes people move, reflexively.  This 
20110108233121.000|20110108233123.000|TR0|is different.   This is hearing a command, 
20110108233123.000|20110108233126.000|TR0|understanding that command, and responding 
20110108233126.000|20110108233128.000|TR0|to it in some way. Whatever the command 
20110108233128.000|20110108233131.000|TR0|may be.
20110108233131.000|20110108233133.000|TR0|
20110108233133.000|20110108233136.000|TR0|LEMON:  This isn't like the doctor, the 
20110108233136.000|20110108233138.000|TR0|eye thing.  You don't do that sort of 
20110108233138.000|20110108233141.000|TR0|thing.  You ask them to do certain things 
20110108233141.000|20110108233143.000|TR0|to see if their body functions are working?
20110108233143.000|20110108233145.000|TR0|
20110108233145.000|20110108233148.000|TR0|GUPTA:  When they're looking in the eyes 
20110108233148.000|20110108233150.000|TR0|and looking specifically at the pupils.  
20110108233150.000|20110108233153.000|TR0|They want to make sure the pupils aren't 
20110108233153.000|20110108233155.000|TR0|dilated.  That could be an indication 
20110108233155.000|20110108233158.000|TR0|there's a lot of swelling in the brain.  
20110108233158.000|20110108233200.000|TR0|This is really an important sign.  It 
20110108233200.000|20110108233202.000|TR0|gives a much higher level of brain 
20110108233202.000|20110108233205.000|TR0|function than just reflex activity or 
20110108233205.000|20110108233207.000|TR0|pupil activity or anything else. This is 
20110108233207.000|20110108233210.000|TR0|good.  This is very good sign for her.
20110108233210.000|20110108233212.000|TR0|
20110108233212.000|20110108233215.000|TR0|LEMON:  If she came in and they said do 
20110108233215.000|20110108233217.000|TR0|this, do that and she does, they're like, 
20110108233217.000|20110108233220.000|TR0|good stuff, get her here quickly, do the 
20110108233220.000|20110108233222.000|TR0|CAT scan as you say then go into surgery.  
20110108233222.000|20110108233224.000|TR0|Timing is important.
20110108233224.000|20110108233227.000|TR0|
20110108233227.000|20110108233229.000|TR0|GUPTA:  That's right.  This part we're 
20110108233229.000|20110108233232.000|TR0|talking about after the operation.  Before 
20110108233232.000|20110108233234.000|TR0|the operation she may have been moving 
20110108233234.000|20110108233237.000|TR0|around, moving both sides of her body.  
20110108233237.000|20110108233239.000|TR0|Maybe not following commands at that time. 
20110108233239.000|20110108233242.000|TR0| Now they got the pressure off the brain.  
20110108233242.000|20110108233244.000|TR0|They removed some of the bleeding.  She's 
20110108233244.000|20110108233246.000|TR0|able to do some of this stuff.  That's 
20110108233246.000|20110108233249.000|TR0|important. Keep doing that over the next 
20110108233249.000|20110108233251.000|TR0|day or two.
20110108233251.000|20110108233254.000|TR0|
20110108233254.000|20110108233256.000|TR0|LEMON:  How often do they do it?  Will 
20110108233256.000|20110108233259.000|TR0|they go in and ask her to do it?
20110108233259.000|20110108233301.000|TR0|
20110108233301.000|20110108233304.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You know, my guess is it will be 
20110108233304.000|20110108233306.000|TR0|almost every hour, maybe more frequently 
20110108233306.000|20110108233308.000|TR0|than that.  You know, it's a balance --
20110108233308.000|20110108233311.000|TR0|
20110108233311.000|20110108233313.000|TR0|LEMON:  When she comes to, right?
20110108233313.000|20110108233316.000|TR0|
20110108233316.000|20110108233318.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Want to make sure she's 
20110108233318.000|20110108233321.000|TR0|comfortable enough.  Give pain medication 
20110108233321.000|20110108233323.000|TR0|so she's comfortable.  That will make her 
20110108233323.000|20110108233325.000|TR0|sleepy.  But then have her waking up every 
20110108233325.000|20110108233328.000|TR0|hour or so, to check this and make sure 
20110108233328.000|20110108233330.000|TR0|there's no swelling going on in her brain. 
20110108233330.000|20110108233333.000|TR0| That is the biggest concern at this 
20110108233333.000|20110108233335.000|TR0|point.  You think of the brain as a fluid 
20110108233335.000|20110108233338.000|TR0|medium, and you've given it a big shock.  
20110108233338.000|20110108233340.000|TR0|It's going to start to swell.  That 
20110108233340.000|20110108233343.000|TR0|swelling happens, you can either control 
20110108233343.000|20110108233345.000|TR0|that with medications, or another surgery. 
20110108233345.000|20110108233347.000|TR0| You have to make sure you know when it's 
20110108233347.000|20110108233350.000|TR0|happening.
20110108233350.000|20110108233352.000|TR0|
20110108233352.000|20110108233355.000|TR0|LEMON:  Doctor Sanjay Gupta, very good 
20110108233355.000|20110108233357.000|TR0|information.  Thank you for walking us 
20110108233357.000|20110108233400.000|TR0|through that.  We wish her the best.
20110108233400.000|20110108233402.000|TR0|
20110108233402.000|20110108233405.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Absolutely.
20110108233405.000|20110108233407.000|TR0|
20110108233407.000|20110108233409.000|TR0|LEMON:  The prognosis right now they say 
20110108233409.000|20110108233412.000|TR0|optimistic.
20110108233412.000|20110108233414.000|TR0|
20110108233414.000|20110108233417.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Right.  And I'll listen in with 
20110108233417.000|20110108233419.000|TR0|you and we'll see what else happens.
20110108233419.000|20110108233422.000|TR0|
20110108233422.000|20110108233424.000|TR0|LEMON:  Thank you.

20110108233458.000|20110108233501.000|TR0|Headquarters in Atlanta.  Breaking news 
20110108233501.000|20110108233503.000|TR0|out of Tucson, Arizona:  A federal judge 
20110108233503.000|20110108233506.000|TR0|is dead and a congresswoman critically 
20110108233506.000|20110108233508.000|TR0|wounded from a mass shooting this morning 
20110108233508.000|20110108233510.000|TR0|at a supermarket.  Democratic 
20110108233510.000|20110108233513.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was 
20110108233513.000|20110108233515.000|TR0|holding a public event at a Safeway in 
20110108233515.000|20110108233518.000|TR0|North Tucson when a gunman targeted her.  
20110108233518.000|20110108233520.000|TR0|Six people were killed including a 
20110108233520.000|20110108233523.000|TR0|nine-year-old girl.

20110108233525.000|20110108233528.000|TR0|Suspected gunman, 22-year-old Jared Lee 
20110108233528.000|20110108233530.000|TR0|Loughner is in custody.  A .9 millimeter 
20110108233530.000|20110108233532.000|TR0|handgun was recovered.
20110108233532.000|20110108233535.000|TR0|
20110108233535.000|20110108233537.000|TR0|Now, Giffords seen here with her husband, 
20110108233537.000|20110108233540.000|TR0|he is astronaut Mark Kelly, had just won 
20110108233540.000|20110108233542.000|TR0|her third term after a close and 
20110108233542.000|20110108233545.000|TR0|contentious campaign. She was meeting this 
20110108233545.000|20110108233547.000|TR0|morning with constituents outside a busy 
20110108233547.000|20110108233550.000|TR0|Safeway supermarket when the shooting 
20110108233550.000|20110108233552.000|TR0|started.
20110108233552.000|20110108233554.000|TR0|
20110108233554.000|20110108233557.000|TR0|Doctors say the congresswoman is out of 
20110108233557.000|20110108233559.000|TR0|surgery now and is expected to survive.  
20110108233559.000|20110108233602.000|TR0|We're keeping a close eye on her 
20110108233602.000|20110108233604.000|TR0|condition.  Doctor Sanjay Gupta checking 
20110108233604.000|20110108233607.000|TR0|as well.

20110108233609.000|20110108233611.000|TR0|As we have been telling you here, Federal 
20110108233611.000|20110108233614.000|TR0|Judge John Roll was among those killed.  
20110108233614.000|20110108233616.000|TR0|He was appointed to the bench by the first 
20110108233616.000|20110108233619.000|TR0|President Bush in 1991.  "The Washington

20110108233624.000|20110108233626.000|TR0|2009 because of death threats after he 
20110108233626.000|20110108233629.000|TR0|allowed a lawsuit filed by illegal 
20110108233629.000|20110108233631.000|TR0|immigrants to go forward against a rancher.

20110108233633.000|20110108233636.000|TR0|CNN's Wolf Blitzer joins us now from 
20110108233636.000|20110108233638.000|TR0|Washington.
20110108233638.000|20110108233641.000|TR0|
20110108233641.000|20110108233643.000|TR0|Wolf, this started in Tucson, Arizona, but 
20110108233643.000|20110108233646.000|TR0|it has repercussions from Washington and 
20110108233646.000|20110108233648.000|TR0|beyond.
20110108233648.000|20110108233651.000|TR0|
20110108233651.000|20110108233653.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  You heard the 
20110108233653.000|20110108233655.000|TR0|president of the United States.  It's not 
20110108233655.000|20110108233658.000|TR0|every weekend, obviously the president 
20110108233658.000|20110108233700.000|TR0|goes out and makes a statement like this.  
20110108233700.000|20110108233703.000|TR0|You could see how wrenching it was for the 
20110108233703.000|20110108233705.000|TR0|president.  The vice president has now 
20110108233705.000|20110108233708.000|TR0|weighed in.  All of the top leadership in 
20110108233708.000|20110108233710.000|TR0|Washington.  The new speaker, Democrats 
20110108233710.000|20110108233713.000|TR0|and Republicans. It really is a shock to 
20110108233713.000|20110108233715.000|TR0|the entire system, to see this happening.  
20110108233715.000|20110108233717.000|TR0|Six people killed, 12 people injured, 
20110108233717.000|20110108233720.000|TR0|right now, including a congresswoman.
20110108233720.000|20110108233722.000|TR0|
20110108233722.000|20110108233725.000|TR0|It is a very, very sad story.  We don't 
20110108233725.000|20110108233727.000|TR0|know the motive.  We don't know about the 
20110108233727.000|20110108233730.000|TR0|suspect.  We don't know what possibly 
20110108233730.000|20110108233732.000|TR0|could have led the suspect to open fire on 
20110108233732.000|20110108233734.000|TR0|a crowd like this in Tucson.
20110108233734.000|20110108233737.000|TR0|
20110108233737.000|20110108233739.000|TR0|But whatever the motive was, it's just the 
20110108233739.000|20110108233742.000|TR0|sick, sick situation and people are going 
20110108233742.000|20110108233744.000|TR0|to study it and make sure that first of 
20110108233744.000|20110108233747.000|TR0|all there are no other accomplices and if, 
20110108233747.000|20110108233749.000|TR0|in fact, there are accomplices or if this 
20110108233749.000|20110108233752.000|TR0|was a lone individual.  They're also going 
20110108233752.000|20110108233754.000|TR0|to make sure they learn from this so it 
20110108233754.000|20110108233756.000|TR0|doesn't happen again.  It's a wake-up call 
20110108233756.000|20110108233759.000|TR0|to the entire society.  I dare say.
20110108233759.000|20110108233801.000|TR0|
20110108233801.000|20110108233804.000|TR0|LEMON:  Wolf, I want to ask you this.  So 
20110108233804.000|20110108233806.000|TR0|many contacts in Washington. Take us 
20110108233806.000|20110108233809.000|TR0|behind the scenes.  Take our viewers to 
20110108233809.000|20110108233811.000|TR0|Washington and what people are talking 
20110108233811.000|20110108233814.000|TR0|about.  The phone calls that you have had 
20110108233814.000|20110108233816.000|TR0|today that others are having.  The 
20110108233816.000|20110108233818.000|TR0|e-mails, conversations about this.
20110108233818.000|20110108233821.000|TR0|
20110108233821.000|20110108233823.000|TR0|BLITZER:  She's a very well liked 
20110108233823.000|20110108233826.000|TR0|congresswoman.  She's a moderate Democrat, 
20110108233826.000|20110108233828.000|TR0|some would call her a blue dog Democrat, a 
20110108233828.000|20110108233831.000|TR0|conservative Democrat in that district in 
20110108233831.000|20110108233833.000|TR0|Arizona.  She's by no means to the far 
20110108233833.000|20110108233835.000|TR0|liberal side of the Democratic Party.
20110108233835.000|20110108233838.000|TR0|
20110108233838.000|20110108233840.000|TR0|She was pleasant, very cheerful, and 
20110108233840.000|20110108233843.000|TR0|friendly.  There had been some threats she 
20110108233843.000|20110108233845.000|TR0|received in her office, but that's not 
20110108233845.000|20110108233848.000|TR0|necessarily all that unusual.  Most 
20110108233848.000|20110108233850.000|TR0|members of Congress at some point get 
20110108233850.000|20110108233853.000|TR0|angry letters are from constituents.  
20110108233853.000|20110108233855.000|TR0|Sometimes it's even a phone call, 
20110108233855.000|20110108233857.000|TR0|sometimes there are actual threats and 
20110108233857.000|20110108233900.000|TR0|Capitol Hill police are involved and the 
20110108233900.000|20110108233902.000|TR0|FBI sometimes is brought in. It's one 
20110108233902.000|20110108233905.000|TR0|thing to get an angry threat.
20110108233905.000|20110108233907.000|TR0|
20110108233907.000|20110108233910.000|TR0|It's another thing to actually see gunfire 
20110108233910.000|20110108233912.000|TR0|and gunshots occur as is the case this 
20110108233912.000|20110108233915.000|TR0|time and it's just a shocking situation.  
20110108233915.000|20110108233917.000|TR0|And I'm sure that everyone from the 
20110108233917.000|20110108233919.000|TR0|president of the United States to the vice 
20110108233919.000|20110108233922.000|TR0|president on down, from the new speaker, 
20110108233922.000|20110108233924.000|TR0|from the majority leader in the Senate, 
20110108233924.000|20110108233927.000|TR0|they are shocked by this.
20110108233927.000|20110108233929.000|TR0|
20110108233929.000|20110108233932.000|TR0|It's going to have very severe 
20110108233932.000|20110108233934.000|TR0|ramifications because a lot of members, 
20110108233934.000|20110108233937.000|TR0|Don, a natural thing, they're going to be 
20110108233937.000|20110108233939.000|TR0|reluctant to go out without the kind of 
20110108233939.000|20110108233941.000|TR0|security that they probably will have in 
20110108233941.000|20110108233944.000|TR0|the aftermath of what happened in Tucson.
20110108233944.000|20110108233946.000|TR0|
20110108233946.000|20110108233949.000|TR0|LEMON:  When something like this as well, 
20110108233949.000|20110108233951.000|TR0|they should who wouldn't, who wouldn't?  
20110108233951.000|20110108233954.000|TR0|Even the FBI Director Robert Muller being 
20110108233954.000|20110108233956.000|TR0|sent there.
20110108233956.000|20110108233958.000|TR0|
20110108233958.000|20110108234001.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Even if they don't want to have 
20110108234001.000|20110108234003.000|TR0|security, their staff will say you have to 
20110108234003.000|20110108234006.000|TR0|have some security.  Certainly their 
20110108234006.000|20110108234008.000|TR0|family will say before you go out into an 
20110108234008.000|20110108234011.000|TR0|open crowd like that, make sure you have 
20110108234011.000|20110108234013.000|TR0|security.  Make sure you have backup.
20110108234013.000|20110108234016.000|TR0|
20110108234016.000|20110108234018.000|TR0|Most of these members, 435 members of the 
20110108234018.000|20110108234020.000|TR0|House, 100 senators, they don't want to 
20110108234020.000|20110108234023.000|TR0|have to walk around with security all the 
20110108234023.000|20110108234025.000|TR0|time.  They want to go into a mall.  They 
20110108234025.000|20110108234028.000|TR0|want to go out to a rally.  They want to --
20110108234028.000|20110108234030.000|TR0|
20110108234030.000|20110108234033.000|TR0|LEMON:  They want to be among the people.
20110108234033.000|20110108234035.000|TR0|
20110108234035.000|20110108234038.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes, they just want to talk to 
20110108234038.000|20110108234040.000|TR0|their constituents.  They don't want to 
20110108234040.000|20110108234042.000|TR0|necessarily have the kind of security that 
20110108234042.000|20110108234045.000|TR0|a president or a vice president or a 
20110108234045.000|20110108234047.000|TR0|speaker has, but you know, it's probably 
20110108234047.000|20110108234050.000|TR0|going to change, at least in the short 
20110108234050.000|20110108234052.000|TR0|run.  That's probably totally 
20110108234052.000|20110108234055.000|TR0|understandable.
20110108234055.000|20110108234057.000|TR0|
20110108234057.000|20110108234100.000|TR0|LEMON:  Hey, Wolf, thanks for taking the 
20110108234100.000|20110108234102.000|TR0|time to join us here.  It's 6:30 Eastern 
20110108234102.000|20110108234104.000|TR0|on CNN.  Wolf is going to pick up our 
20110108234104.000|20110108234107.000|TR0|coverage at 7:00 p.m. eastern.  He's going 
20110108234107.000|20110108234109.000|TR0|to take it for a couple hours then I'll be 
20110108234109.000|20110108234112.000|TR0|back.  There will be continuing coverage 
20110108234112.000|20110108234114.000|TR0|here.  Wolf Blitzer, thank you.  See you 
20110108234114.000|20110108234117.000|TR0|in about 28 minutes.
20110108234117.000|20110108234119.000|TR0|
20110108234119.000|20110108234121.000|TR0|I want to go to senior congressional 
20110108234121.000|20110108234124.000|TR0|correspondent Dana Bash in Washington.  
20110108234124.000|20110108234126.000|TR0|Dana, you heard our conversation.  Wolf 
20110108234126.000|20110108234129.000|TR0|and I talking about wake-up call.  You and 
20110108234129.000|20110108234131.000|TR0|I have spoken about this.  I just can't 
20110108234131.000|20110108234134.000|TR0|imagine what members of Congress are 
20110108234134.000|20110108234136.000|TR0|thinking right now, and feeling. DANA 
20110108234136.000|20110108234139.000|TR0|BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL 
20110108234139.000|20110108234141.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  They're feeling very, 
20110108234141.000|20110108234143.000|TR0|obviously, upset.  Very, very upset.  Very 
20110108234143.000|20110108234146.000|TR0|emotional and a little bit scared, some of 
20110108234146.000|20110108234148.000|TR0|them that we've heard on our air about the 
20110108234148.000|20110108234151.000|TR0|idea of going out and doing their jobs, 
20110108234151.000|20110108234153.000|TR0|which is what Gabby Giffords was doing.
20110108234153.000|20110108234156.000|TR0|
20110108234156.000|20110108234158.000|TR0|She was doing her job. She was doing what 
20110108234158.000|20110108234201.000|TR0|actually had been encouraged by Rahm 
20110108234201.000|20110108234203.000|TR0|Emanuel when he was a member of Congress 
20110108234203.000|20110108234205.000|TR0|and he was in charge of electing 
20110108234205.000|20110108234208.000|TR0|Democrats.  She came in on that wave and 
20110108234208.000|20110108234210.000|TR0|he had said, look, go out and go to do 
20110108234210.000|20110108234213.000|TR0|these Congress on your corners.  Keep in 
20110108234213.000|20110108234215.000|TR0|touch with your constituents, which is 
20110108234215.000|20110108234218.000|TR0|what she did.
20110108234218.000|20110108234220.000|TR0|
20110108234220.000|20110108234223.000|TR0|She was also assembling.  I want to play a 
20110108234223.000|20110108234225.000|TR0|sound bite for you, don. It is Gabby 
20110108234225.000|20110108234227.000|TR0|Giffords on the floor of the House.  
20110108234227.000|20110108234230.000|TR0|Remember late last week members of the 
20110108234230.000|20110108234232.000|TR0|house read the U.S. constitution on the 
20110108234232.000|20110108234235.000|TR0|floor for the first time.  Gabby Giffords 
20110108234235.000|20110108234237.000|TR0|read the first amendment.  Listen.

20110108234311.000|20110108234314.000|TR0|BASH:  The right of the people, peaceably, 
20110108234314.000|20110108234316.000|TR0|to assemble.  Obviously, we all learned 
20110108234316.000|20110108234319.000|TR0|that in school and we know especially 
20110108234319.000|20110108234321.000|TR0|given what we do what the first amendment 
20110108234321.000|20110108234324.000|TR0|says, but it's I think a little bit eerie 
20110108234324.000|20110108234326.000|TR0|to hear her talking about that now on the 
20110108234326.000|20110108234328.000|TR0|floor of the House.
20110108234328.000|20110108234331.000|TR0|
20110108234331.000|20110108234333.000|TR0|And I would just tell you a little 
20110108234333.000|20110108234336.000|TR0|anecdote that when she and I talked in the 
20110108234336.000|20110108234338.000|TR0|hallway just yesterday, Don, we were just 
20110108234338.000|20110108234341.000|TR0|chatting.  She made a point of telling me 
20110108234341.000|20110108234343.000|TR0|that she wanted me to know she did read 
20110108234343.000|20110108234346.000|TR0|the first amendment.  She pointed to me 
20110108234346.000|20110108234348.000|TR0|and said, that's you.  That's you in the 
20110108234348.000|20110108234350.000|TR0|press. You should be happy that I did that.
20110108234350.000|20110108234353.000|TR0|
20110108234353.000|20110108234355.000|TR0|One of the note, we have been getting 
20110108234355.000|20110108234358.000|TR0|statements pouring in from so many of her 
20110108234358.000|20110108234400.000|TR0|colleagues.  Republicans, Democrats, 
20110108234400.000|20110108234403.000|TR0|members of the leadership.  I mean, 
20110108234403.000|20110108234405.000|TR0|everybody expressing their concern, their 
20110108234405.000|20110108234407.000|TR0|sadness, but also, frankly, some anger as 
20110108234407.000|20110108234410.000|TR0|you can imagine.
20110108234410.000|20110108234412.000|TR0|
20110108234412.000|20110108234415.000|TR0|I want to read a statement, part of it 
20110108234415.000|20110108234417.000|TR0|from the senior senator from her home 
20110108234417.000|20110108234420.000|TR0|state of Arizona John McCain.  He said 
20110108234420.000|20110108234422.000|TR0|this, whoever did this, whatever their 
20110108234422.000|20110108234425.000|TR0|reason, they're a disgrace to Arizona, 
20110108234425.000|20110108234427.000|TR0|this country and the human race and will 
20110108234427.000|20110108234429.000|TR0|deserve and receive the contempt of all 
20110108234429.000|20110108234432.000|TR0|decent people and the strongest punishment 
20110108234432.000|20110108234434.000|TR0|of the law.  Pretty strong there from John 
20110108234434.000|20110108234437.000|TR0|McCain.
20110108234437.000|20110108234439.000|TR0|
20110108234439.000|20110108234442.000|TR0|LEMON:  Dana, you're right.  Every -- it 
20110108234442.000|20110108234444.000|TR0|seems like every couple seconds my e-mail 
20110108234444.000|20110108234447.000|TR0|light comes on, blinks with a statement 
20110108234447.000|20110108234449.000|TR0|from everyone from the attorney general of 
20110108234449.000|20110108234451.000|TR0|the United States.  I read one from the 
20110108234451.000|20110108234454.000|TR0|Tea Party Express, Nancy Pelosi, everyone 
20110108234454.000|20110108234456.000|TR0|really, John Boehner.  Of course, she was 
20110108234456.000|20110108234459.000|TR0|just sworn in, was it three days ago by 
20110108234459.000|20110108234501.000|TR0|John Boehner, the new speaker?  Her third 
20110108234501.000|20110108234504.000|TR0|term. BASH:  That's right.  That's right.  
20110108234504.000|20110108234506.000|TR0|Look, she is somebody who, and you've 
20110108234506.000|20110108234509.000|TR0|heard this from Republicans and Democrats 
20110108234509.000|20110108234511.000|TR0|who have come on our air.  She is well 
20110108234511.000|20110108234513.000|TR0|liked.  She's a 40-year-old woman.  She's 
20110108234513.000|20110108234516.000|TR0|young. She's energetic.  She, you know, 
20110108234516.000|20110108234518.000|TR0|it's hard to pass her in the hallway 
20110108234518.000|20110108234521.000|TR0|without a smile on her face.  But she's 
20110108234521.000|20110108234523.000|TR0|somebody who has had very, very, very 
20110108234523.000|20110108234526.000|TR0|tough political fights every time.
20110108234526.000|20110108234528.000|TR0|
20110108234528.000|20110108234530.000|TR0|LEMON:  You know, you're right.  Everyone 
20110108234530.000|20110108234533.000|TR0|has said that.  The interesting thing is, 
20110108234533.000|20110108234535.000|TR0|even Wolf who just said that before you.  
20110108234535.000|20110108234538.000|TR0|It appears she had no enemies and guess 
20110108234538.000|20110108234540.000|TR0|what, we don't know if she was targeted.  
20110108234540.000|20110108234543.000|TR0|She could have been part of something 
20110108234543.000|20110108234545.000|TR0|random because so many people were shot 
20110108234545.000|20110108234548.000|TR0|and injured and, of course, killed.
20110108234548.000|20110108234550.000|TR0|
20110108234550.000|20110108234552.000|TR0|BASH:  That's a very good point.  And I 
20110108234552.000|20110108234555.000|TR0|should remind our viewers something we 
20110108234555.000|20110108234557.000|TR0|reported earlier, that the U.S. Capitol 
20110108234557.000|20110108234600.000|TR0|Police sent out a notice to senators, 
20110108234600.000|20110108234602.000|TR0|obviously she's in the House, but this is 
20110108234602.000|20110108234605.000|TR0|to senators, saying just that, that they 
20110108234605.000|20110108234607.000|TR0|have no indication at this time this event 
20110108234607.000|20110108234610.000|TR0|is part of a larger threat against 
20110108234610.000|20110108234612.000|TR0|congressional membership.
20110108234612.000|20110108234614.000|TR0|
20110108234614.000|20110108234617.000|TR0|I spoke to the Senate sergeant at arms who 
20110108234617.000|20110108234619.000|TR0|was getting briefed on the investigation.  
20110108234619.000|20110108234622.000|TR0|His name is Terry Gainer.  He told me it 
20110108234622.000|20110108234624.000|TR0|appears to be an isolated incident.  
20110108234624.000|20110108234627.000|TR0|Isolated to her and, again, very important 
20110108234627.000|20110108234629.000|TR0|to know in terms of the motivation, we 
20110108234629.000|20110108234632.000|TR0|just don't know yet.
20110108234632.000|20110108234634.000|TR0|
20110108234634.000|20110108234636.000|TR0|LEMON:  Our senior congressional 
20110108234636.000|20110108234639.000|TR0|correspondent Dana Bash.  Thank you so 
20110108234639.000|20110108234641.000|TR0|much for that information.
20110108234641.000|20110108234644.000|TR0|
20110108234644.000|20110108234646.000|TR0|The president spoke out just a short time 
20110108234646.000|20110108234649.000|TR0|ago about this tragedy and said the full 
20110108234649.000|20110108234651.000|TR0|force of the government was behind the 
20110108234651.000|20110108234653.000|TR0|investigation.  He sent everyone from the 
20110108234653.000|20110108234656.000|TR0|FBI director there, to FBI members as 
20110108234656.000|20110108234658.000|TR0|well.  We saw them combing for evidence in 
20110108234658.000|20110108234701.000|TR0|the parking lot of that Safeway 
20110108234701.000|20110108234703.000|TR0|Supermarket.
20110108234703.000|20110108234706.000|TR0|
20110108234706.000|20110108234708.000|TR0|What else is happening at the White House? 
20110108234708.000|20110108234711.000|TR0| Because the president said it's not over 
20110108234711.000|20110108234713.000|TR0|yet.  Our Ed Henry is standing by in 
20110108234713.000|20110108234715.000|TR0|Washington.

20110108234723.000|20110108234725.000|TR0|LEMON:  Unless there's some major 
20110108234725.000|20110108234728.000|TR0|legislation that they're wrangling over, 
20110108234728.000|20110108234730.000|TR0|usually the weekends have quiet in

20110108234733.000|20110108234735.000|TR0|for the president.  Not today.  Senior

20110108234737.000|20110108234740.000|TR0|standing by at the White House for us.

20110108234742.000|20110108234745.000|TR0|Ed, for the president to comment, this is 
20110108234745.000|20110108234747.000|TR0|big news and serious news.

20110108234752.000|20110108234755.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  It really is, Don. This 
20110108234755.000|20110108234757.000|TR0|was a routine Saturday.  The president, 
20110108234757.000|20110108234759.000|TR0|first lady started the morning going to a 
20110108234759.000|20110108234802.000|TR0|basketball game for their daughter, Sasha 
20110108234802.000|20110108234804.000|TR0|and then all of a sudden it took a 
20110108234804.000|20110108234807.000|TR0|dramatic and ugly turn obviously.
20110108234807.000|20110108234809.000|TR0|
20110108234809.000|20110108234812.000|TR0|I can tell you, White House officials at 
20110108234812.000|20110108234814.000|TR0|all levels really sprung in quickly to get 
20110108234814.000|20110108234816.000|TR0|on top of what is now a sprawling federal 
20110108234816.000|20110108234819.000|TR0|investigation coordinated by the FBI at 
20110108234819.000|20110108234821.000|TR0|the president's direction.  We're told by 
20110108234821.000|20110108234824.000|TR0|officials here the president was 
20110108234824.000|20110108234826.000|TR0|officially notified about 1:20 p.m. 
20110108234826.000|20110108234829.000|TR0|Eastern Time by John Brennan, his Homeland 
20110108234829.000|20110108234831.000|TR0|Security adviser, and then he went into 
20110108234831.000|20110108234834.000|TR0|the White House situation room.
20110108234834.000|20110108234836.000|TR0|
20110108234836.000|20110108234838.000|TR0|You could see this official White House 
20110108234838.000|20110108234841.000|TR0|photo.  What's significant about it is the 
20110108234841.000|20110108234843.000|TR0|array of officials in there including on 
20110108234843.000|20110108234846.000|TR0|the left see you Tom Dolin, his national 
20110108234846.000|20110108234848.000|TR0|security adviser, but also the new White 
20110108234848.000|20110108234851.000|TR0|House Chief Of Staff Bill Daly right there 
20110108234851.000|20110108234853.000|TR0|in the center of the photo talking to the 
20110108234853.000|20110108234856.000|TR0|president, helping to brief the president

20110108234900.000|20110108234903.000|TR0|I can tell you.  After that the president 
20110108234903.000|20110108234905.000|TR0|came out to the state dining room and gave 
20110108234905.000|20110108234908.000|TR0|some marks talking about how he personally 
20110108234908.000|20110108234910.000|TR0|knows Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and 
20110108234910.000|20110108234913.000|TR0|said, look, she's as tough as they come 
20110108234913.000|20110108234915.000|TR0|and she's fighting for her life right now 
20110108234915.000|20110108234917.000|TR0|and he asked the American people to rally 
20110108234917.000|20110108234920.000|TR0|around all of the victims.  Take a listen.

20110108234932.000|20110108234935.000|TR0|family members of those who have been 
20110108234935.000|20110108234937.000|TR0|slain.  We are going to get to the bottom 
20110108234937.000|20110108234939.000|TR0|of this and we're going to get through 
20110108234939.000|20110108234942.000|TR0|this.  But in the meantime, I think all of 
20110108234942.000|20110108234944.000|TR0|us need to make sure we're offering our 
20110108234944.000|20110108234947.000|TR0|thoughts and prayers to those concerned.  
20110108234947.000|20110108234949.000|TR0|Thank you.

20110108234957.000|20110108234959.000|TR0|HENRY:  Now, at about 3:00 p.m. Eastern 
20110108234959.000|20110108235001.000|TR0|Time, the president also made a serious of 
20110108235001.000|20110108235004.000|TR0|phone calls.  You can see from the second 
20110108235004.000|20110108235006.000|TR0|White House photo they've released here 
20110108235006.000|20110108235009.000|TR0|just a short time ago.  It shows the 
20110108235009.000|20110108235011.000|TR0|president on the phone with Jan Brewer, 
20110108235011.000|20110108235014.000|TR0|the Arizona governor, a Republican who has 
20110108235014.000|20110108235016.000|TR0|sparred with this president.
20110108235016.000|20110108235019.000|TR0|
20110108235019.000|20110108235021.000|TR0|She gave a news conference pointing out 
20110108235021.000|20110108235023.000|TR0|politics set aside by both sides here.  
20110108235023.000|20110108235026.000|TR0|The president in that call pledging all 
20110108235026.000|20110108235028.000|TR0|federal resources to the state of Arizona 
20110108235028.000|20110108235031.000|TR0|to get on top of this.  He also called 
20110108235031.000|20110108235033.000|TR0|we're told congressional leaders in both 
20110108235033.000|20110108235036.000|TR0|parties to also brief them on the 
20110108235036.000|20110108235038.000|TR0|situation.
20110108235038.000|20110108235040.000|TR0|
20110108235040.000|20110108235043.000|TR0|And in terms of federal resources the 
20110108235043.000|20110108235045.000|TR0|president personally talking to the FBI 
20110108235045.000|20110108235048.000|TR0|Director Robert Muller and sending him to 
20110108235048.000|20110108235050.000|TR0|Arizona to make sure this investigation is 
20110108235050.000|20110108235053.000|TR0|coordinated.  Finally, one very 
20110108235053.000|20110108235055.000|TR0|interesting phone call the president 
20110108235055.000|20110108235058.000|TR0|placed was to Mark Kelly.  He is the 
20110108235058.000|20110108235100.000|TR0|husband of the congresswoman and he is a 
20110108235100.000|20110108235102.000|TR0|NASA astronaut.
20110108235102.000|20110108235105.000|TR0|
20110108235105.000|20110108235107.000|TR0|We're told by White House officials he 
20110108235107.000|20110108235110.000|TR0|could not reach him, that the president 
20110108235110.000|20110108235112.000|TR0|had to leave a message because her husband 
20110108235112.000|20110108235115.000|TR0|obviously was in flight trying to get to 
20110108235115.000|20110108235117.000|TR0|Arizona to be at her side, Don.
20110108235117.000|20110108235120.000|TR0|
20110108235120.000|20110108235122.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right.  Thank you very much.

20110108235142.000|20110108235144.000|TR0|hospital today.  What did he see?  What 
20110108235144.000|20110108235146.000|TR0|did he hear?

20110108235156.000|20110108235159.000|TR0|breaking news for you here on CNN.  A 
20110108235159.000|20110108235201.000|TR0|shocking attack at a Tucson, Arizona, 
20110108235201.000|20110108235203.000|TR0|grocery store.  Six people dead, 12 others 
20110108235203.000|20110108235206.000|TR0|wounded including Democratic Congresswoman 
20110108235206.000|20110108235208.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords who was shot in the 
20110108235208.000|20110108235211.000|TR0|head.
20110108235211.000|20110108235213.000|TR0|
20110108235213.000|20110108235216.000|TR0|She's now listed in critical condition, 
20110108235216.000|20110108235218.000|TR0|but her doctor is optimistic about her 
20110108235218.000|20110108235221.000|TR0|recovery.  Congresswoman Giffords was 
20110108235221.000|20110108235223.000|TR0|holding a constituent meeting at the store 
20110108235223.000|20110108235225.000|TR0|when the shooting happened among the dead, 
20110108235225.000|20110108235228.000|TR0|Federal Judge John Roll and a 9-year-old 
20110108235228.000|20110108235230.000|TR0|girl.
20110108235230.000|20110108235233.000|TR0|
20110108235233.000|20110108235235.000|TR0|Police do have a suspect in custody right 
20110108235235.000|20110108235238.000|TR0|now.  He's identified as 22- year-old 
20110108235238.000|20110108235240.000|TR0|Jared Lee Loughner.  They've also 
20110108235240.000|20110108235243.000|TR0|recovered a handgun, a .9 millimeter 
20110108235243.000|20110108235245.000|TR0|glock, no word on any possible motive yet.

20110108235247.000|20110108235250.000|TR0|A federal law enforcement official said 
20110108235250.000|20110108235252.000|TR0|the shootings appear to have no nexus to 
20110108235252.000|20110108235255.000|TR0|terrorism.  Again, the quote is no nexus 
20110108235255.000|20110108235257.000|TR0|to terrorism. This official did not know 
20110108235257.000|20110108235300.000|TR0|if there had been any recent threat 
20110108235300.000|20110108235302.000|TR0|against Representative Giffords, however.
20110108235302.000|20110108235305.000|TR0|
20110108235305.000|20110108235307.000|TR0|Joining me now is Matt Heinz, he's an

20110108235356.000|20110108235358.000|TR0|health care vote.  You're a doctor, you're 
20110108235358.000|20110108235401.000|TR0|a representative and again, a friend of 
20110108235401.000|20110108235403.000|TR0|the congresswoman.  What have your

20110108235406.000|20110108235408.000|TR0|and friends there at the hospital?
20110108235408.000|20110108235410.000|TR0|
20110108235410.000|20110108235413.000|TR0|HEINZ:  I have been speaking only to 
20110108235413.000|20110108235415.000|TR0|friends here at the hospital, and everyone 
20110108235415.000|20110108235418.000|TR0|is, you know, completely shocked, and, by 
20110108235418.000|20110108235420.000|TR0|the tragedy.  And we're all just pulling 
20110108235420.000|20110108235423.000|TR0|together and are thoughts, again, are with 
20110108235423.000|20110108235425.000|TR0|the congresswoman and her family.
20110108235425.000|20110108235428.000|TR0|
20110108235428.000|20110108235430.000|TR0|The next 24 hours, of course, with any 
20110108235430.000|20110108235432.000|TR0|injury like this, as you know, are 
20110108235432.000|20110108235435.000|TR0|essential and crucial, and I know all of 
20110108235435.000|20110108235437.000|TR0|us were very, very pleased to hear the 
20110108235437.000|20110108235440.000|TR0|words of her surgeon, given his optimism 
20110108235440.000|20110108235442.000|TR0|for her recovery.  I think that gives me 
20110108235442.000|20110108235445.000|TR0|great hope.
20110108235445.000|20110108235447.000|TR0|
20110108235447.000|20110108235449.000|TR0|LEMON:  Right when this happened, Matt, 
20110108235449.000|20110108235452.000|TR0|you and I spoke by telephone, and you said 
20110108235452.000|20110108235454.000|TR0|you'd got a phone call from a friend 
20110108235454.000|20110108235457.000|TR0|telling and you were stunned.  We could 
20110108235457.000|20110108235459.000|TR0|barely have a conversation.  You said that 
20110108235459.000|20110108235502.000|TR0|you two are friends and you help each 
20110108235502.000|20110108235504.000|TR0|other politically.  You have a history 
20110108235504.000|20110108235507.000|TR0|together.
20110108235507.000|20110108235509.000|TR0|
20110108235509.000|20110108235511.000|TR0|HEINZ:  I've known the congresswoman for 
20110108235511.000|20110108235514.000|TR0|more than five years and she is just a 
20110108235514.000|20110108235516.000|TR0|phenomenal human and an excellent 
20110108235516.000|20110108235519.000|TR0|representative.  Doing exactly what she 
20110108235519.000|20110108235521.000|TR0|always does, meeting with her people, her 
20110108235521.000|20110108235524.000|TR0|constituents.  Very early in my political 
20110108235524.000|20110108235526.000|TR0|career, she was a supporter and a friend 
20110108235526.000|20110108235529.000|TR0|and very encouraging.  Just a wonderful, 
20110108235529.000|20110108235531.000|TR0|loving human and it's tragic that this 
20110108235531.000|20110108235533.000|TR0|would happen to her and you know -- not 
20110108235533.000|20110108235536.000|TR0|much else to say.
20110108235536.000|20110108235538.000|TR0|
20110108235538.000|20110108235541.000|TR0|LEMON:  Well, Matt, we don't know if she 
20110108235541.000|20110108235543.000|TR0|was targeted or if this was random because 
20110108235543.000|20110108235546.000|TR0|so many were affected by this.  Anything 
20110108235546.000|20110108235548.000|TR0|you want to say about the political 
20110108235548.000|20110108235551.000|TR0|process or about the person responsible?
20110108235551.000|20110108235553.000|TR0|
20110108235553.000|20110108235555.000|TR0|HEINZ:  I think it's important right now 
20110108235555.000|20110108235558.000|TR0|for everyone to pull together and to be 
20110108235558.000|20110108235600.000|TR0|civil and you know, hug someone you like 
20110108235600.000|20110108235603.000|TR0|and maybe hug someone you don't like.  
20110108235603.000|20110108235605.000|TR0|Because I think that's really important 
20110108235605.000|20110108235608.000|TR0|that we keep things calm, collected and 
20110108235608.000|20110108235610.000|TR0|just focused and try to keep our 
20110108235610.000|20110108235612.000|TR0|discussions civil.
20110108235612.000|20110108235615.000|TR0|
20110108235615.000|20110108235617.000|TR0|LEMON:  Yes, Arizona State Representative 
20110108235617.000|20110108235620.000|TR0|Matt Heinz, he is a doctor as well and a 
20110108235620.000|20110108235622.000|TR0|friend of the congresswoman.  He's at the 
20110108235622.000|20110108235625.000|TR0|hospital now speaking to friends and 
20110108235625.000|20110108235627.000|TR0|checking on her, how she's doing.  Do you 
20110108235627.000|20110108235630.000|TR0|work out of this hospital ever, Doctor?
20110108235630.000|20110108235632.000|TR0|
20110108235632.000|20110108235634.000|TR0|HEINZ:  No, I was trained at this 
20110108235634.000|20110108235637.000|TR0|hospital.  I work at a different hospital 
20110108235637.000|20110108235639.000|TR0|in Tucson.
20110108235639.000|20110108235642.000|TR0|
20110108235642.000|20110108235644.000|TR0|LEMON:  OK, thank you very much, Matt 
20110108235644.000|20110108235647.000|TR0|Heinz.  Best of luck, OK.

20110108235649.000|20110108235652.000|TR0|Next up, the Honorable Judge Rebecca White 
20110108235652.000|20110108235654.000|TR0|Berch, the chief justice of Arizona 
20110108235654.000|20110108235656.000|TR0|Supreme Court and friend of Judge Roll 
20110108235656.000|20110108235659.000|TR0|coming up.

20110108235706.000|20110108235709.000|TR0|LEMON:  Breaking news here on CNN.  Pardon 
20110108235709.000|20110108235711.000|TR0|me, I'm pulling something off the printer 
20110108235711.000|20110108235714.000|TR0|here some new information coming in.  
20110108235714.000|20110108235716.000|TR0|Breaking news that we're covering, the 
20110108235716.000|20110108235718.000|TR0|shootings in Arizona that left so many 
20110108235718.000|20110108235721.000|TR0|dead. A congresswoman is in critical 
20110108235721.000|20110108235723.000|TR0|condition right now.
20110108235723.000|20110108235726.000|TR0|
20110108235726.000|20110108235728.000|TR0|As a matter of fact, we want to speak to 
20110108235728.000|20110108235731.000|TR0|someone who knows her.  The Honorable 
20110108235731.000|20110108235733.000|TR0|Judge Rebecca White Berch, she's a chief 
20110108235733.000|20110108235735.000|TR0|justice of Arizona Supreme Court and she's 
20110108235735.000|20110108235738.000|TR0|a friend of Judge Roll.  She's a friend of 
20110108235738.000|20110108235740.000|TR0|Judge Roll.  Tell us about Judge Roll and 
20110108235740.000|20110108235743.000|TR0|do you think that he may have been 
20110108235743.000|20110108235745.000|TR0|targeted for some reason?
20110108235745.000|20110108235748.000|TR0|
20110108235748.000|20110108235750.000|TR0|JUDGE REBECCA WHITE BERCH, CHIEF JUSTICE, 
20110108235750.000|20110108235753.000|TR0|ARIZONA SUPREME COURT (via telephone):  
20110108235753.000|20110108235755.000|TR0|Well, let me first tell you about Judge 
20110108235755.000|20110108235757.000|TR0|Roll.  He was well loved in the Arizona 
20110108235757.000|20110108235800.000|TR0|legal community.  He was one of those 
20110108235800.000|20110108235802.000|TR0|judges who was always just thoughtful and 
20110108235802.000|20110108235805.000|TR0|wise and patient and kind so that's a 
20110108235805.000|20110108235807.000|TR0|little bit about Judge Roll.
20110108235807.000|20110108235810.000|TR0|
20110108235810.000|20110108235812.000|TR0|As far as I know, we can't tell whether he 
20110108235812.000|20110108235815.000|TR0|was targeted.  This seems to have been an 
20110108235815.000|20110108235817.000|TR0|event that took place at an event that 
20110108235817.000|20110108235819.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords was holding and we 
20110108235819.000|20110108235822.000|TR0|don't know if anyone would have known he 
20110108235822.000|20110108235824.000|TR0|would have been in the area.  We'll leave 
20110108235824.000|20110108235827.000|TR0|it for those who investigate to find out 
20110108235827.000|20110108235829.000|TR0|if he was targeted, but at the moment, I 
20110108235829.000|20110108235832.000|TR0|don't see anything that points to that.
20110108235832.000|20110108235834.000|TR0|
20110108235834.000|20110108235837.000|TR0|LEMON:  He had protection from U.S. 
20110108235837.000|20110108235839.000|TR0|marshals about a year or so ago because of 
20110108235839.000|20110108235841.000|TR0|a lawsuit involving illegal immigrants.  
20110108235841.000|20110108235844.000|TR0|It was a huge multi-million dollar 
20110108235844.000|20110108235846.000|TR0|immigration suit so he had protection for 
20110108235846.000|20110108235849.000|TR0|a while.  It's not out of the realm of 
20110108235849.000|20110108235851.000|TR0|possibilities, but we simply don't know 
20110108235851.000|20110108235854.000|TR0|yet.
20110108235854.000|20110108235856.000|TR0|
20110108235856.000|20110108235858.000|TR0|BERCH:  It is not out of the realm of 
20110108235858.000|20110108235901.000|TR0|possibility as you mentioned. Just a year 
20110108235901.000|20110108235903.000|TR0|ago, Judge Roll received several threats 
20110108235903.000|20110108235906.000|TR0|in connection with cases that he was 
20110108235906.000|20110108235908.000|TR0|handling, but you know, he was the kind of 
20110108235908.000|20110108235911.000|TR0|guy that never really talked about the 
20110108235911.000|20110108235913.000|TR0|threats he was receiving and the 
20110108235913.000|20110108235916.000|TR0|protection it was necessary for him to 
20110108235916.000|20110108235918.000|TR0|have.

20110108235925.000|20110108235928.000|TR0|appreciate it.
