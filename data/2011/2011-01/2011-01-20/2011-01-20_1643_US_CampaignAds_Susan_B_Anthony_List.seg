interestingly enough a job destroyed doctor hall to ever here to talk about uh... another promise of her keeping medicine sure in the tax dollars would never used to fund elective abortions cash a ban on taxpayer funding of abortions as well the people turned out to be the world of the land the current loft vertically as a force by this administration does not reflect worked for the american people flash of realism but to the american people for american out they spoke on the shoes issue loudly and uh... clearly soviet included eleanor pledge and today we're making good on that commitment congressman chris smith has introduced a bipartisan legislation electropharesis hyde amendment's and other similar policies by permanently apply in a ban on text on it proportions across all federal program this common sense what the solution reflects the will of the people and deserves the support of the house as one of our highest legislative priorities and have such i've directed uh... that they've received their the designation of age or three i appreciate the congressman steve says perhaps uh... leadership up on this critical issue for that from government sticker thank you very much for leadership i know for a fact that it's very with speaker bainer for sold many years i've been here thirty one years ago defending unborn child from the violence of abortion is a core conviction as well as for majority leader cantor also age or three really reflex his an hour profound commitment respecting the sanctity of human life and and getting rid of they keep hermitage scattering of taxpayer funding for abortion like in to disagree columbia but making permanent those policies like the high demand that might feel and i offered back in nineteen eighty three ought to prescribe funny under the federal employees health benefits program uh... in all of the other narrative programs within the federal government including obama care to assure that the taxpayer poop huge majorities clearly show that did not want their money being used to pay for abortions no longer are coerced into using taxpayer funding to subsidize to two million unborn child and wounding of his or her mother president obama has said that he wants abortion to beware the good luck arrested two which is no friend of the bridge arm of planned parenthood has said very clearly manic and and and plainly that

with conscience protection it's very sad case of a nurse in new york it outside made named uh... mister column forced into doing assisting in a deep any abortion gruesome abortion done late term against her will under threats uh... and she tried to sue in federal court and she was knocked down because the remedies weren't there are legislation also includes a very important conscience protection talked with the power of the courts to insure that conscientious objectives doctors hospitals healthcare networks individual health care personnel are not forced to participate in the taking of a human life figuring thank you so much for your children yesenia mr speaker if you think at this point europe's highest legislative priorities perfect ill health care now bent like this now what about jobs dot jobs with the highest priority folio appeared to upload the repeal of the health care lawyer through it uh... one of the significant uh... issues was the fact that it's destroying jobs in america helpful arms feel very strongly about the sanctity of human life we listen to the american people we've made a commitment did american people in our pledge to america continuing to fulfill our committee take their frequently jobs package on what is your catalog the policies that have enacted over the last two years it's led to the poor a lot of uncertainty for small businesses uh... and whether it's the health care law or whether it's blip up to some of these agencies are doing all of this uh... has a tremendous impact on jobs in our country and we will be able to use one at a time okay mr speaker hollywood's how would this committee politics and health care lol especially connections restrictions on it'll make clear taxpayer funding collect what works and i will not be the policy of the scope hot safeguard insignia greatly replaying videos but we had an opportunity during a health care debate to include with the stupak language uh... which would have made clear in law by the taxpayer funding of elective abortion as part of it uh... that was uh... look at that did not occur and and clearly there is no flowed out estou where the administration really is on this issue i think do will all the people will still be attacked this clear-cut prohibition on the use of taxpayer funds elective abortions hannah their protested but actually i was in nineteen eighty eight adventure to eighty five grandparenting helen's of facts lately proposition action but i thought depends bill is also legislation has been introduced this this would not affect funding for planned parenthood i and and speaker who's somebody must give support to parents bill because grandparents today performs in its own clinics over three hundred twenty four thousand abortions every year they are the largest abortion network uh... in the world they derive up to a billion dollars each year from fees and governments including the federal government local in and county in federal and state part and a huge amount of money comes from the united states government this bill no taxpayer funding for abortion act uh... does not deal with the issue of planned parenthood but certainly depends bill well sleeker rather risky behaviour revealed elizabeth senator dodd visitor their plans to tactic kids at california's of don't like this one from his war our goal layers let's stop the job destroyed health care and we're going to use all of the legislative tools that we have a little more towards uh... so that uh... most of the week and unpacked stop and if you believe as i did events in interfering with employers bubbly at the heart of people arguably provided but uh... the health care lol will rule in the best health care delivery system in the world interview believe as i
