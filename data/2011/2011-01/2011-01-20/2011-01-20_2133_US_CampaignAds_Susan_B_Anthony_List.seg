are listening i hope by friends of the other side of the aisle take the other side of this issue will begin listening and he needs to be a re-evaluation america needs to take a second look in longhand and sustained look at the surface of the arguments of the abortion rights side oh abortion is violence against children it is members the child it decapitated a child it chemically poisoned the child one of our earlier speakers talk about r_u_ forty six and hal telenet abortion to being promoted by planned parenthood argue forty six actually operates in two ways the first chemical stars the baby two deaths so the childhood hero the child in the womb simply cannot get nourishment to continue living and the second a chemical out the the expulsion of that baby who is usually did but not always all that is in town to visit the other methods of abortion an are not child abuse i don't know what is this idea that birth begins our life begins at birth but is belongs in another car especially with ultrasound technologies of sellable as a several of my colleagues have said the window to the womb all commit affected should be noted that even deleting pro-abortion are activist in the sixties and early seventies doctor bernard make the city from new york one of the three co-founders of moving around which is one of the leading pro-abortion groups in the country doctored mason said he presided over sixty thousand deaths to children as he ran the largest abortion clinic in new york city uh... he went on to become a pro-lifer and what caused that huge change of heart uh... both in a smiling then in his heart it was that he began doing blood transfusions and and begin to see that on board child is a patient just like any other patient who may be sick have a disability that early uh... efforts interfaces could mitigate whatever that not only might be and because of that he said how can i be in one room killing a baby with poison or dismemberment while another doctor's office or another uh... operating theater providing as prenatal surgery he saw the schizophrenic and heart in treating some children because they're wanted as being acceptable and we welcome them after i wanted to throw weights you know that feminists had it right when he said no woman should ever i'll be treated as an object well we all know all that the unborn child if he or she is unwanted is treated like in object and a throwaway and no human life is a throwaway let me also say that abby johnson just a little over a year ago left by planned parenthood directorship in texas what caused her to change she saw and ultrasound abortion as in real time and said i just saw the david crumple right in front of my very eyes and you know if that is in a human rights abuses i don't know what is give their so she became a pro-life renown speaks out very very boldly uh... finally doctor how the leaking as i mentioned earlier is martin luther king king's niece dr king had to abortions she was a quote pro-choicers she now is one of the most powerful pro-ltte life leaders in united states and even in the world she has said how can the dream survive talking about her uncles dream of inclusion of human rights of civil rights for all how can the dream survive she writes if we murder at the children she goes on to talk about how the african-american population in this country is so disproportionately targeted by planned parenthood and others and the number of abortions for african-americans or about five times little race of of caucasians are it is because of targeting and there are other reasons but that is one of the main reason that's where the plant parent clinics are abortion hurts women she makes it so clear she's eloquent in their defense has our others in in in the ministries to women who have had abortions one thing about this pro-life proven and i've been added for thirty eight years ago in congress for twenty thirty one years involves then wealth it says that both the mother and to the baby we want to put our arms around you we want to help you want to be of assistance antennae post a portable woman we're all about trying to help them to assist and provide some kind of pathway to reconciliation and that's where the poster board of women like doctor of eating our play such a crucial role in helping women who are the workers which feels so disenfranchised and left out i want to thank our leadership speaker bainer are arbitrarily radar blogger cancer are we have to a very pro-life leadership who recognizes how sacred life is how this congress this house needs to defend it the defenseless tomorrow i will be joining others who say we speak here as he speaks on the no taxpayer a funding for abortion act will be having a press conference are tomorrow and we have over a hundred twenty-five co-sponsors i'd never seen a leadership so dedicated to protecting innocent human life as these individuals in our leadership i would hope my friends of the other side of the aisle with take a second long look all happy carnage the unbelievable paying and aditi and suffering that abortion has visited upon women it is not pro women abortion exploits women and it's certainly not pro-child either because it decimate unborn children as well so that we we we have a great leadership we have a actually group of members men and women democrats or republicans and i do hope that day we will move this human rights issue forward for young people are with us and obviously i was raped he was great struggle
