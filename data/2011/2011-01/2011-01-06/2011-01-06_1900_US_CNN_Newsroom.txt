20110106190007.000|20110106190009.000|TR0|ALI VELSHI, CNN ANCHOR:  All right.  We're 
20110106190009.000|20110106190011.000|TR0|looking at two live pictures here.
20110106190011.000|20110106190014.000|TR0|
20110106190014.000|20110106190016.000|TR0|On the left, I believe, is the Pentagon.
20110106190016.000|20110106190018.000|TR0|
20110106190018.000|20110106190021.000|TR0|Is that correct, Valerie (ph)?
20110106190021.000|20110106190023.000|TR0|
20110106190023.000|20110106190026.000|TR0|We're expecting to hear from Defense 
20110106190026.000|20110106190028.000|TR0|Secretary Robert Gates regarding an 
20110106190028.000|20110106190030.000|TR0|announcement to send 1,400 more Marines to 
20110106190030.000|20110106190033.000|TR0|Afghanistan to bolster some of the 
20110106190033.000|20110106190035.000|TR0|activities there and to counter a Taliban 
20110106190035.000|20110106190037.000|TR0|insurgency that they are expecting in the 
20110106190037.000|20110106190040.000|TR0|spring.
20110106190040.000|20110106190042.000|TR0|
20110106190042.000|20110106190045.000|TR0|On the right, we are looking at the U.S. 
20110106190045.000|20110106190047.000|TR0|Treasury, where we are expecting to hear 
20110106190047.000|20110106190049.000|TR0|an announcement about an appointment 
20110106190049.000|20110106190052.000|TR0|having to do with Holly Petraeus.  She is 
20110106190052.000|20110106190054.000|TR0|the wife of General David Petraeus, who is 
20110106190054.000|20110106190057.000|TR0|going to be appointed to a key position 
20110106190057.000|20110106190059.000|TR0|with respect to the consumer finance 
20110106190059.000|20110106190101.000|TR0|legislation that was passed several years 
20110106190101.000|20110106190104.000|TR0|ago.
20110106190104.000|20110106190106.000|TR0|
20110106190106.000|20110106190108.000|TR0|We'll tell you about both of those when 
20110106190108.000|20110106190111.000|TR0|they happen
20110106190111.000|20110106190113.000|TR0|
20110106190113.000|20110106190116.000|TR0|When last we talked about U.S. troops in 
20110106190116.000|20110106190118.000|TR0|Afghanistan, all eyes were on July, six 
20110106190118.000|20110106190120.000|TR0|months from now.  Why?  Because that's 
20110106190120.000|20110106190123.000|TR0|when U.S. forces may ever so gradually 
20110106190123.000|20110106190125.000|TR0|begin to pull out.  That is still the 
20110106190125.000|20110106190128.000|TR0|plan, officially.
20110106190128.000|20110106190130.000|TR0|
20110106190130.000|20110106190132.000|TR0|Today, however, comes word that in the 
20110106190132.000|20110106190135.000|TR0|meantime, more troops are going to go in.  
20110106190135.000|20110106190137.000|TR0|That's why we were looking at the Pentagon.
20110106190137.000|20110106190139.000|TR0|
20110106190139.000|20110106190142.000|TR0|Already, far more U.S. troops are in 
20110106190142.000|20110106190144.000|TR0|country than ever before. Take a look at 
20110106190144.000|20110106190147.000|TR0|this.
20110106190147.000|20110106190149.000|TR0|
20110106190149.000|20110106190151.000|TR0|Our troops, of course, went in at the end 
20110106190151.000|20110106190154.000|TR0|of 2001, after the 9/11 attacks.  And 
20110106190154.000|20110106190156.000|TR0|gradually, with very few exceptions, it's 
20110106190156.000|20110106190159.000|TR0|been going up. But look at this escalation 
20110106190159.000|20110106190201.000|TR0|in 2009 and then into 2010.  We're at the 
20110106190201.000|20110106190203.000|TR0|highest level yet, about 97,000 troops.
20110106190203.000|20110106190206.000|TR0|
20110106190206.000|20110106190208.000|TR0|As we speak, they are planning to -- by 
20110106190208.000|20110106190210.000|TR0|the way, 97,000 U.S. troops, 131,000 total 
20110106190210.000|20110106190213.000|TR0|for the NATO force.  Soon these troops 
20110106190213.000|20110106190215.000|TR0|will be joined by 1,400 Marines heading 
20110106190215.000|20110106190218.000|TR0|for the southern Taliban strongholds of 
20110106190218.000|20110106190220.000|TR0|Helmand province and Kandahar province.
20110106190220.000|20110106190222.000|TR0|
20110106190222.000|20110106190225.000|TR0|Their goal, in the words of one senior 
20110106190225.000|20110106190227.000|TR0|U.S. official, is to take advantage of the 
20110106190227.000|20110106190229.000|TR0|security gains that have already been 
20110106190229.000|20110106190232.000|TR0|achieved and to minimize the chances of a 
20110106190232.000|20110106190234.000|TR0|Taliban offensive in the spring.  OK.      
20110106190234.000|20110106190237.000|TR0| A world away from the Afghan theater, the 
20110106190237.000|20110106190239.000|TR0|wife of the commanding U.S. general is 
20110106190239.000|20110106190241.000|TR0|taking on a threat to U.S. troops around 
20110106190241.000|20110106190244.000|TR0|the world. Not a threat that most 
20110106190244.000|20110106190246.000|TR0|non-military families would think of, by 
20110106190246.000|20110106190249.000|TR0|the way.
20110106190249.000|20110106190251.000|TR0|
20110106190251.000|20110106190253.000|TR0|Pentagon surveys have found money problems 
20110106190253.000|20110106190256.000|TR0|rank very high on the list of service 
20110106190256.000|20110106190258.000|TR0|members' stress factors, obviously.  
20110106190258.000|20110106190300.000|TR0|Higher even, by the, way than health and 
20110106190300.000|20110106190303.000|TR0|family relationships.
20110106190303.000|20110106190305.000|TR0|
20110106190305.000|20110106190308.000|TR0|So, today Holly Petraeus, wife of 
20110106190308.000|20110106190310.000|TR0|four-star General David Petraeus, is 
20110106190310.000|20110106190312.000|TR0|taking charge of the Office of Service 
20110106190312.000|20110106190315.000|TR0|Member Affairs in the brand new Consumer 
20110106190315.000|20110106190317.000|TR0|Financial Protection Bureau.  You're 
20110106190317.000|20110106190320.000|TR0|looking at the -- well, I'll show you -- 
20110106190320.000|20110106190322.000|TR0|there you go.  You're looking at a picture 
20110106190322.000|20110106190324.000|TR0|of the room where we're expecting that 
20110106190324.000|20110106190327.000|TR0|announcement to be made.
20110106190327.000|20110106190329.000|TR0|
20110106190329.000|20110106190331.000|TR0|CNN's Jessica Yellin is following that 
20110106190331.000|20110106190334.000|TR0|story.  We've got her on the phone for 
20110106190334.000|20110106190336.000|TR0|"Two at the Top."
20110106190336.000|20110106190339.000|TR0|
20110106190339.000|20110106190341.000|TR0|Jessica, tell us a little about this.  
20110106190341.000|20110106190343.000|TR0|What is the thing that necessitates the 
20110106190343.000|20110106190346.000|TR0|appointment of somebody to this particular 
20110106190346.000|20110106190348.000|TR0|position?
20110106190348.000|20110106190351.000|TR0|
20110106190351.000|20110106190353.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL 
20110106190353.000|20110106190355.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Ali.
20110106190355.000|20110106190358.000|TR0|
20110106190358.000|20110106190400.000|TR0|One of the key concerns that led to 
20110106190400.000|20110106190402.000|TR0|Congress forming this consumer bureau is 
20110106190402.000|20110106190405.000|TR0|that there were all these complaints that 
20110106190405.000|20110106190407.000|TR0|service members who are overseas, serving 
20110106190407.000|20110106190410.000|TR0|this country at war, are getting calls and 
20110106190410.000|20110106190412.000|TR0|letters from their families saying that, 
20110106190412.000|20110106190414.000|TR0|you know, I got talked into this loan, it 
20110106190414.000|20110106190417.000|TR0|wasn't what I thought it would be, that 
20110106190417.000|20110106190419.000|TR0|there are all of these abusive practices 
20110106190419.000|20110106190421.000|TR0|by dishonest lenders who are luring 
20110106190421.000|20110106190424.000|TR0|military families into financial trouble.
20110106190424.000|20110106190426.000|TR0|
20110106190426.000|20110106190429.000|TR0|So this new bureau has formed this office. 
20110106190429.000|20110106190431.000|TR0| Holly Petraeus, the wife of General David 
20110106190431.000|20110106190433.000|TR0|Petraeus, is going to be able to work with 
20110106190433.000|20110106190436.000|TR0|the DOD, we're told.  They'll work in 
20110106190436.000|20110106190438.000|TR0|partnership with the Department of Defense 
20110106190438.000|20110106190441.000|TR0|to both educate the families of service 
20110106190441.000|20110106190443.000|TR0|members and also help them with claims 
20110106190443.000|20110106190445.000|TR0|against abusive lenders, and answer 
20110106190445.000|20110106190448.000|TR0|questions for these military families.
20110106190448.000|20110106190450.000|TR0|
20110106190450.000|20110106190452.000|TR0|They'll work with federal and state 
20110106190452.000|20110106190455.000|TR0|agencies to coordinate response.  And 
20110106190455.000|20110106190457.000|TR0|they're going to -- it's basically -- they 
20110106190457.000|20110106190500.000|TR0|say it's a way to help pay back these 
20110106190500.000|20110106190502.000|TR0|people who are doing so much for the 
20110106190502.000|20110106190504.000|TR0|country, and at least get them clear of 
20110106190504.000|20110106190507.000|TR0|any dishonest lenders who are taking 
20110106190507.000|20110106190509.000|TR0|advantage of them.
20110106190509.000|20110106190512.000|TR0|
20110106190512.000|20110106190514.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  You've got to think, 
20110106190514.000|20110106190516.000|TR0|Jessica, for all the people who are based 
20110106190516.000|20110106190519.000|TR0|here in the United States and not busy 
20110106190519.000|20110106190521.000|TR0|fighting a war, there are complications.  
20110106190521.000|20110106190523.000|TR0|I mean, you can't even figure your way 
20110106190523.000|20110106190526.000|TR0|through the financial system if you're not 
20110106190526.000|20110106190528.000|TR0|in the military.  So it does seem worse 
20110106190528.000|20110106190531.000|TR0|that people are taking advantage of 
20110106190531.000|20110106190533.000|TR0|service members.
20110106190533.000|20110106190535.000|TR0|
20110106190535.000|20110106190538.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Absolutely.  And you add all the 
20110106190538.000|20110106190540.000|TR0|stress and the fact that one of your 
20110106190540.000|20110106190543.000|TR0|family members, that a husband or wife is 
20110106190543.000|20110106190545.000|TR0|now not working, so probably not making a 
20110106190545.000|20110106190547.000|TR0|paycheck in their regular job here, so all 
20110106190547.000|20110106190550.000|TR0|these strains on the family.       There 
20110106190550.000|20110106190552.000|TR0|just has been no central office to help 
20110106190552.000|20110106190554.000|TR0|with oversight of these issues.  And Holly 
20110106190554.000|20110106190557.000|TR0|Petraeus will not just be running it, 
20110106190557.000|20110106190559.000|TR0|she'll be setting it up, figuring out how 
20110106190559.000|20110106190602.000|TR0|it needs to be structured to best respond

20110106190606.000|20110106190609.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Excellent, Jessica.  We'll watch 
20110106190609.000|20110106190611.000|TR0|her swearing in when it takes place.  
20110106190611.000|20110106190613.000|TR0|Thank you, Jessica Yellin.
20110106190613.000|20110106190616.000|TR0|
20110106190616.000|20110106190618.000|TR0|There you go.  There it is.  We are just 
20110106190618.000|20110106190621.000|TR0|about -- that's Elizabeth Warren, by the 
20110106190621.000|20110106190623.000|TR0|way, very important -- she has played a 
20110106190623.000|20110106190625.000|TR0|very important role in formulating the 
20110106190625.000|20110106190628.000|TR0|Consumer Finance Protection Act.
20110106190628.000|20110106190630.000|TR0|
20110106190630.000|20110106190633.000|TR0|We will keep an eye on that for you.

20110106190640.000|20110106190642.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Well, a study linking autism to 
20110106190642.000|20110106190644.000|TR0|childhood vaccines has been declared 
20110106190644.000|20110106190647.000|TR0|fraudulent, but this story is far from 
20110106190647.000|20110106190649.000|TR0|over.  What do you do right now if you're 
20110106190649.000|20110106190652.000|TR0|a parent concerned about vaccinating your 
20110106190652.000|20110106190654.000|TR0|child?  Elizabeth Cohen is here to 
20110106190654.000|20110106190656.000|TR0|separate fact from fiction right after the

20110106190706.000|20110106190708.000|TR0|VELSHI:  OK.  We're just getting this 
20110106190708.000|20110106190711.000|TR0|information in now.  You're looking at 
20110106190711.000|20110106190713.000|TR0|live pictures from KABC.  WTOP, our radio 
20110106190713.000|20110106190715.000|TR0|affiliate in Washington, D.C., is 
20110106190715.000|20110106190718.000|TR0|reporting that two packages have exploded 
20110106190718.000|20110106190720.000|TR0|in two Maryland State government buildings.
20110106190720.000|20110106190723.000|TR0|
20110106190723.000|20110106190725.000|TR0|One package was at the Jeffrey Building on 
20110106190725.000|20110106190727.000|TR0|Francis Street in Annapolis.  Another one 
20110106190727.000|20110106190730.000|TR0|was at the Maryland Department of 
20110106190730.000|20110106190732.000|TR0|Transportation Building in Hanover.
20110106190732.000|20110106190735.000|TR0|
20110106190735.000|20110106190737.000|TR0|A government official says no one was hurt 
20110106190737.000|20110106190739.000|TR0|in either incident, but we are working on 
20110106190739.000|20110106190742.000|TR0|getting details of two package explosions 
20110106190742.000|20110106190744.000|TR0|inside Maryland government buildings, one 
20110106190744.000|20110106190746.000|TR0|of them in a Department of Transportation 
20110106190746.000|20110106190749.000|TR0|office and one at the Jeffrey Building in 
20110106190749.000|20110106190751.000|TR0|Annapolis.
20110106190751.000|20110106190754.000|TR0|
20110106190754.000|20110106190756.000|TR0|You are looking -- that's WBAL, our 
20110106190756.000|20110106190758.000|TR0|affiliate.  That does not look like 
20110106190758.000|20110106190801.000|TR0|Annapolis right there, so that may be the 
20110106190801.000|20110106190803.000|TR0|one that's at the Jeffrey Building.  This 
20110106190803.000|20110106190805.000|TR0|is Hanover, Maryland, that you're looking 
20110106190805.000|20110106190808.000|TR0|at right now.
20110106190808.000|20110106190810.000|TR0|
20110106190810.000|20110106190813.000|TR0|You can see a lot of emergency vehicles on 
20110106190813.000|20110106190815.000|TR0|location.  We do have the initial 
20110106190815.000|20110106190817.000|TR0|information that we have.  WTOP, our CNN 
20110106190817.000|20110106190820.000|TR0|Radio affiliate in Washington, also 
20110106190820.000|20110106190822.000|TR0|reporting no injuries reported in the two 
20110106190822.000|20110106190825.000|TR0|explosions.  But apparently, the 
20110106190825.000|20110106190827.000|TR0|explosions did take place inside the 
20110106190827.000|20110106190829.000|TR0|buildings.
20110106190829.000|20110106190832.000|TR0|
20110106190832.000|20110106190834.000|TR0|So, two packages.  That's what we know at 
20110106190834.000|20110106190836.000|TR0|the moment.
20110106190836.000|20110106190839.000|TR0|
20110106190839.000|20110106190841.000|TR0|We do apparently have -- I don't know if I 
20110106190841.000|20110106190844.000|TR0|saw another shot from Annapolis, Valerie 
20110106190844.000|20110106190846.000|TR0|(ph).  Is this the one we're looking at 
20110106190846.000|20110106190848.000|TR0|right now?
20110106190848.000|20110106190851.000|TR0|
20110106190851.000|20110106190853.000|TR0|WBAL.  This is Hanover, Maryland.  This 
20110106190853.000|20110106190856.000|TR0|was a Department of Transportation -- a 
20110106190856.000|20110106190858.000|TR0|Maryland Department of Transportation 
20110106190858.000|20110106190900.000|TR0|building.     We're at the mercy of our 
20110106190900.000|20110106190903.000|TR0|affiliate's helicopter there.  We're 
20110106190903.000|20110106190905.000|TR0|thankful for it, but I can't tell you 
20110106190905.000|20110106190907.000|TR0|exactly what we're pointing at the moment, 
20110106190907.000|20110106190910.000|TR0|or whether that is the building that we're 
20110106190910.000|20110106190912.000|TR0|talking about.
20110106190912.000|20110106190915.000|TR0|
20110106190915.000|20110106190917.000|TR0|Most of the emergencies -- most of the 
20110106190917.000|20110106190919.000|TR0|emergency vehicles seem to be centered 
20110106190919.000|20110106190922.000|TR0|around something a little bit closer than 
20110106190922.000|20110106190924.000|TR0|building where the explosion may have 
20110106190924.000|20110106190927.000|TR0|taken place.  You can see there where 
20110106190927.000|20110106190929.000|TR0|Hanover and Annapolis are.  Annapolis, 
20110106190929.000|20110106190931.000|TR0|obviously the state capital.
20110106190931.000|20110106190934.000|TR0|
20110106190934.000|20110106190936.000|TR0|We're moving in there.  All right.  So 
20110106190936.000|20110106190938.000|TR0|that is the -- OK.
20110106190938.000|20110106190941.000|TR0|
20110106190941.000|20110106190943.000|TR0|So that is the building that we were 
20110106190943.000|20110106190946.000|TR0|looking at right there, the large 
20110106190946.000|20110106190948.000|TR0|building, what you saw in the aerial 
20110106190948.000|20110106190950.000|TR0|photographs.  That's the Maryland 
20110106190950.000|20110106190953.000|TR0|Department of Transportation headquarters 
20110106190953.000|20110106190955.000|TR0|in Hanover, Maryland.
20110106190955.000|20110106190958.000|TR0|
20110106190958.000|20110106191000.000|TR0|We're taking a look now through Street 
20110106191000.000|20110106191002.000|TR0|View to get a sense of what it is.  OK.  
20110106191002.000|20110106191005.000|TR0|So that's the building.
20110106191005.000|20110106191007.000|TR0|
20110106191007.000|20110106191009.000|TR0|We were looking at it.  That is the 
20110106191009.000|20110106191012.000|TR0|building that we're talking about.  It 
20110106191012.000|20110106191014.000|TR0|does appear that there's no activity at 
20110106191014.000|20110106191017.000|TR0|the building. There were a lot of 
20110106191017.000|20110106191019.000|TR0|emergency vehicles parked some distance 
20110106191019.000|20110106191021.000|TR0|away from that building.
20110106191021.000|20110106191024.000|TR0|
20110106191024.000|20110106191026.000|TR0|Again, officials are telling us there were 
20110106191026.000|20110106191028.000|TR0|two blasts, two different government 
20110106191028.000|20110106191031.000|TR0|buildings in Maryland, but that there were 
20110106191031.000|20110106191033.000|TR0|no injuries in either package explosion.  
20110106191033.000|20110106191036.000|TR0|One of them that you're looking at right 
20110106191036.000|20110106191038.000|TR0|now, in Hanover, Maryland, that's a live 
20110106191038.000|20110106191040.000|TR0|picture from there. Another one in 
20110106191040.000|20110106191043.000|TR0|Annapolis.  It's something called the 
20110106191043.000|20110106191045.000|TR0|Jeffrey Building.
20110106191045.000|20110106191048.000|TR0|
20110106191048.000|20110106191050.000|TR0|We're finding out what the Jeffrey 
20110106191050.000|20110106191052.000|TR0|Building is, what government activity took 
20110106191052.000|20110106191055.000|TR0|place there.  In this particular case, it 
20110106191055.000|20110106191057.000|TR0|is a Department of Transportation -- a 
20110106191057.000|20110106191059.000|TR0|Maryland Department of Transportation 
20110106191059.000|20110106191102.000|TR0|building that we're looking at.
20110106191102.000|20110106191104.000|TR0|
20110106191104.000|20110106191107.000|TR0|The building appears to be just further up 
20110106191107.000|20110106191109.000|TR0|from what you're looking at right now.  If 
20110106191109.000|20110106191111.000|TR0|the camera were to pan up, you would see 
20110106191111.000|20110106191114.000|TR0|it tilt up.  You would see it.
20110106191114.000|20110106191116.000|TR0|
20110106191116.000|20110106191119.000|TR0|But right now you're seeing those 
20110106191119.000|20110106191121.000|TR0|emergency vehicles.  And it does appear 
20110106191121.000|20110106191123.000|TR0|that there have been no injuries.  We're 
20110106191123.000|20110106191126.000|TR0|glad to hear that.
20110106191126.000|20110106191128.000|TR0|
20110106191128.000|20110106191130.000|TR0|But we're staying on top of it with our 
20110106191130.000|20110106191133.000|TR0|affiliates, WBAL and our D.C. CNN Radio 
20110106191133.000|20110106191135.000|TR0|affiliate, WTOP, to find out what, if 
20110106191135.000|20110106191138.000|TR0|anything, authorities know about those 
20110106191138.000|20110106191140.000|TR0|packages, whether there's any information 
20110106191140.000|20110106191142.000|TR0|at all at this stage about where they were 
20110106191142.000|20110106191145.000|TR0|sent, how they were discovered, how they 
20110106191145.000|20110106191147.000|TR0|detonated, who was around when they 
20110106191147.000|20110106191150.000|TR0|detonated.
20110106191150.000|20110106191152.000|TR0|
20110106191152.000|20110106191154.000|TR0|At the moment, this is all the information 
20110106191154.000|20110106191157.000|TR0|we have right now. I'm just checking to 
20110106191157.000|20110106191159.000|TR0|see as new information is coming into us 
20110106191159.000|20110106191201.000|TR0|what we've got, because we've got our 
20110106191201.000|20110106191204.000|TR0|affiliate, WTOP, providing most of the 
20110106191204.000|20110106191206.000|TR0|reporting on this.
20110106191206.000|20110106191209.000|TR0|
20110106191209.000|20110106191211.000|TR0|Again, the building in Annapolis was the 
20110106191211.000|20110106191213.000|TR0|Jeffrey Building on Francis Street, for 
20110106191213.000|20110106191216.000|TR0|those of you who know Annapolis, Maryland. 
20110106191216.000|20110106191218.000|TR0| The one that we're looking at right now, 
20110106191218.000|20110106191220.000|TR0|however, is in Hanover, Maryland.
20110106191220.000|20110106191223.000|TR0|
20110106191223.000|20110106191225.000|TR0|That is the most information I've got 
20110106191225.000|20110106191228.000|TR0|right now.  OK.  Let me just tell you a 
20110106191228.000|20110106191230.000|TR0|little bit more about this.
20110106191230.000|20110106191232.000|TR0|
20110106191232.000|20110106191235.000|TR0|The building in Annapolis, the Jeffrey 
20110106191235.000|20110106191237.000|TR0|Building, is the State House office 
20110106191237.000|20110106191240.000|TR0|building.  The one in Hanover that you're 
20110106191240.000|20110106191242.000|TR0|looking at now is a Department of 
20110106191242.000|20110106191244.000|TR0|Transportation headquarters for the 
20110106191244.000|20110106191247.000|TR0|Maryland Department of Transportation.  We 
20110106191247.000|20110106191249.000|TR0|are getting this information via the 
20110106191249.000|20110106191251.000|TR0|affiliate, WBAL.
20110106191251.000|20110106191254.000|TR0|
20110106191254.000|20110106191256.000|TR0|Apparently, this is attributed to the 
20110106191256.000|20110106191259.000|TR0|Annapolis mayor, Joshua Cohen, telling us 
20110106191259.000|20110106191301.000|TR0|that the Jeffrey Building, an explosion 
20110106191301.000|20110106191303.000|TR0|occurred in Annapolis, Maryland, is the 
20110106191303.000|20110106191306.000|TR0|State House office building.
20110106191306.000|20110106191308.000|TR0|
20110106191308.000|20110106191311.000|TR0|All right.  I'm now getting information -- 
20110106191311.000|20110106191313.000|TR0|my executive producer is telling me that 
20110106191313.000|20110106191315.000|TR0|that is not necessarily the case.
20110106191315.000|20110106191318.000|TR0|
20110106191318.000|20110106191320.000|TR0|Kelly (ph), tell me what you know about 
20110106191320.000|20110106191322.000|TR0|Jeffrey Building.
20110106191322.000|20110106191325.000|TR0|
20110106191325.000|20110106191327.000|TR0|The Office of Homeland Security is in the 
20110106191327.000|20110106191330.000|TR0|Jeffrey Building in Annapolis, and the 
20110106191330.000|20110106191332.000|TR0|secretary of state for Maryland is in the 
20110106191332.000|20110106191334.000|TR0|Jeffrey Building.  That's what we know 
20110106191334.000|20110106191337.000|TR0|right now.
20110106191337.000|20110106191339.000|TR0|
20110106191339.000|20110106191342.000|TR0|So it may not be -- initial reports may 
20110106191342.000|20110106191344.000|TR0|not be that it is the State House 
20110106191344.000|20110106191346.000|TR0|building.  We are understanding that's the 
20110106191346.000|20110106191349.000|TR0|Office of Homeland Security for Maryland 
20110106191349.000|20110106191351.000|TR0|and the secretary of state.
20110106191351.000|20110106191353.000|TR0|
20110106191353.000|20110106191356.000|TR0|This is a building in Annapolis.  The one 
20110106191356.000|20110106191358.000|TR0|you're looking at now is not that one.
20110106191358.000|20110106191401.000|TR0|
20110106191401.000|20110106191403.000|TR0|The one you're looking at right now is 
20110106191403.000|20110106191405.000|TR0|WBAL.  That's from our affiliate in 
20110106191405.000|20110106191408.000|TR0|Baltimore, WBAL of Hanover, Maryland.  And 
20110106191408.000|20110106191410.000|TR0|it's the Department of Transportation 
20110106191410.000|20110106191412.000|TR0|headquarters.
20110106191412.000|20110106191415.000|TR0|
20110106191415.000|20110106191417.000|TR0|You can see emergency vehicles on the 
20110106191417.000|20110106191420.000|TR0|site.  We've seen that helicopter sort of 
20110106191420.000|20110106191422.000|TR0|tilt up and pan to the left to give us a 
20110106191422.000|20110106191424.000|TR0|sense of that building.  But that's the 
20110106191424.000|20110106191427.000|TR0|information that we have.
20110106191427.000|20110106191429.000|TR0|
20110106191429.000|20110106191432.000|TR0|We're now looking at -- I'm just going to 
20110106191432.000|20110106191434.000|TR0|push in and show you where Hanover, 
20110106191434.000|20110106191436.000|TR0|Maryland, is.  That's Hanover.  That's not 
20110106191436.000|20110106191439.000|TR0|Annapolis. That's Annapolis right there.
20110106191439.000|20110106191441.000|TR0|
20110106191441.000|20110106191443.000|TR0|OK.  So that's Annapolis.  That will be 
20110106191443.000|20110106191446.000|TR0|the Jeffrey Building that we're looking at.
20110106191446.000|20110106191448.000|TR0|
20110106191448.000|20110106191451.000|TR0|I'm just getting some more information 
20110106191451.000|20110106191453.000|TR0|right now to tell you about that site that 
20110106191453.000|20110106191455.000|TR0|you're looking at.  All right.  So I'm 
20110106191455.000|20110106191458.000|TR0|looking at the site of what is in the 
20110106191458.000|20110106191500.000|TR0|Jeffrey Building.  I'm just scanning 
20110106191500.000|20110106191503.000|TR0|through that.
20110106191503.000|20110106191505.000|TR0|
20110106191505.000|20110106191507.000|TR0|It is the -- let me just look through this 
20110106191507.000|20110106191510.000|TR0|list.  Secretary of Appointments is in 
20110106191510.000|20110106191512.000|TR0|that building, the secretary of state is 
20110106191512.000|20110106191514.000|TR0|in that building, the Office of Homeland 
20110106191514.000|20110106191517.000|TR0|Security is in that building.  That's what 
20110106191517.000|20110106191519.000|TR0|I can mostly make out.
20110106191519.000|20110106191522.000|TR0|
20110106191522.000|20110106191524.000|TR0|It is 16 Francis Street in Annapolis, 
20110106191524.000|20110106191526.000|TR0|Maryland, for those of you who know.  And 
20110106191526.000|20110106191529.000|TR0|Annapolis is one of those state capitals 
20110106191529.000|20110106191531.000|TR0|that is -- it's an old colonial town 
20110106191531.000|20110106191534.000|TR0|that's very tightly woven.  So, all of 
20110106191534.000|20110106191536.000|TR0|these streets are very close to the state 
20110106191536.000|20110106191538.000|TR0|capital, which is in that round- about 
20110106191538.000|20110106191541.000|TR0|that you can see on the top of the screen.
20110106191541.000|20110106191543.000|TR0|
20110106191543.000|20110106191545.000|TR0|So I can't make out -- I don't know 
20110106191545.000|20110106191548.000|TR0|Annapolis well enough to know where the 
20110106191548.000|20110106191550.000|TR0|street actually is, which one of those 
20110106191550.000|20110106191553.000|TR0|streets it actually is, 16 Francis Street. 
20110106191553.000|20110106191555.000|TR0| And I can't make it out from where we 
20110106191555.000|20110106191557.000|TR0|are. But that is Annapolis that you're 
20110106191557.000|20110106191600.000|TR0|looking at.
20110106191600.000|20110106191602.000|TR0|
20110106191602.000|20110106191604.000|TR0|So, two explosions in two different places 
20110106191604.000|20110106191607.000|TR0|in Maryland.  Both of them did actually 
20110106191607.000|20110106191609.000|TR0|detonate inside two government buildings.
20110106191609.000|20110106191612.000|TR0|
20110106191612.000|20110106191614.000|TR0|One is the -- a government building in 
20110106191614.000|20110106191616.000|TR0|Annapolis, the state capital.  The other 
20110106191616.000|20110106191619.000|TR0|one is the Maryland Department of 
20110106191619.000|20110106191621.000|TR0|Transportation office in Hanover.  And 
20110106191621.000|20110106191624.000|TR0|that's the one you're looking at right now.
20110106191624.000|20110106191626.000|TR0|
20110106191626.000|20110106191628.000|TR0|OK.  So let me -- I'm just trying to get 
20110106191628.000|20110106191631.000|TR0|some more information on this right now.  
20110106191631.000|20110106191633.000|TR0|But we are looking at live pictures from 
20110106191633.000|20110106191635.000|TR0|WBAL, our affiliate there.
20110106191635.000|20110106191638.000|TR0|
20110106191638.000|20110106191640.000|TR0|I'm getting a little more clarity.  My 
20110106191640.000|20110106191643.000|TR0|colleague, Jim Acosta, is letting me know 
20110106191643.000|20110106191645.000|TR0|as we're trying to locate the Annapolis 
20110106191645.000|20110106191647.000|TR0|location that initially we had said -- I 
20110106191647.000|20110106191650.000|TR0|was telling you that it's near the State 
20110106191650.000|20110106191652.000|TR0|House.  It is across the street from the 
20110106191652.000|20110106191655.000|TR0|State House.  The Jeffrey building is 
20110106191655.000|20110106191657.000|TR0|across the street from the State House in 
20110106191657.000|20110106191659.000|TR0|Annapolis.
20110106191659.000|20110106191702.000|TR0|
20110106191702.000|20110106191704.000|TR0|Now, again, we've got two pictures going 
20110106191704.000|20110106191706.000|TR0|on here because we don't have live 
20110106191706.000|20110106191709.000|TR0|pictures from Annapolis just yet.  What we 
20110106191709.000|20110106191711.000|TR0|do have is live pictures from Hanover.
20110106191711.000|20110106191714.000|TR0|
20110106191714.000|20110106191716.000|TR0|That is the building right there.  That's 
20110106191716.000|20110106191718.000|TR0|the Maryland Department of Transportation 
20110106191718.000|20110106191721.000|TR0|headquarters on the right side of your 
20110106191721.000|20110106191723.000|TR0|screen, one of the two buildings in which 
20110106191723.000|20110106191726.000|TR0|a package has detonated.
20110106191726.000|20110106191728.000|TR0|
20110106191728.000|20110106191730.000|TR0|What we are hearing from government 
20110106191730.000|20110106191733.000|TR0|officials and through our CNN D.C. Radio 
20110106191733.000|20110106191735.000|TR0|affiliate, WTOP, is that there were blasts 
20110106191735.000|20110106191737.000|TR0|at both buildings, but that no one was 
20110106191737.000|20110106191740.000|TR0|injured in either of the blasts.  We are 
20110106191740.000|20110106191742.000|TR0|still trying to determine what exploded, 
20110106191742.000|20110106191745.000|TR0|what type of blasts they were, how big, 
20110106191745.000|20110106191747.000|TR0|and how damaging they were.  But what we 
20110106191747.000|20110106191749.000|TR0|do understand is that nobody was injured 
20110106191749.000|20110106191752.000|TR0|in either of those explosions.
20110106191752.000|20110106191754.000|TR0|
20110106191754.000|20110106191757.000|TR0|Now, here is a picture.  This is not -- 
20110106191757.000|20110106191759.000|TR0|these are not live TV pictures.  We're 
20110106191759.000|20110106191801.000|TR0|looking at Google Earth here.
20110106191801.000|20110106191804.000|TR0|
20110106191804.000|20110106191806.000|TR0|These are pictures of Annapolis.  Now, you 
20110106191806.000|20110106191808.000|TR0|see the State House right in the center 
20110106191808.000|20110106191811.000|TR0|there and all of those streets that go off 
20110106191811.000|20110106191813.000|TR0|of it. This explosion was at a building 
20110106191813.000|20110106191816.000|TR0|that is across the road from the State 
20110106191816.000|20110106191818.000|TR0|House.
20110106191818.000|20110106191820.000|TR0|
20110106191820.000|20110106191823.000|TR0|Again, Jim was just helping me out.  Jim 
20110106191823.000|20110106191825.000|TR0|Acosta was just helping me out by letting 
20110106191825.000|20110106191827.000|TR0|me know where it was.
20110106191827.000|20110106191830.000|TR0|
20110106191830.000|20110106191832.000|TR0|But there's the State House.  And there 
20110106191832.000|20110106191835.000|TR0|are a number of streets leading up to it, 
20110106191835.000|20110106191837.000|TR0|sort of up a hill.  And there are 
20110106191837.000|20110106191839.000|TR0|buildings that -- government buildings 
20110106191839.000|20110106191842.000|TR0|that surround it.       One of those 
20110106191842.000|20110106191844.000|TR0|buildings is the Jeffrey Building.  That 
20110106191844.000|20110106191847.000|TR0|is -- that houses a number of government 
20110106191847.000|20110106191849.000|TR0|offices, including the Maryland Office of 
20110106191849.000|20110106191851.000|TR0|Homeland Security and the Secretary of 
20110106191851.000|20110106191854.000|TR0|State's Office.
20110106191854.000|20110106191856.000|TR0|
20110106191856.000|20110106191858.000|TR0|Very, very -- information is sort of 
20110106191858.000|20110106191901.000|TR0|trickling in at the moment from our 
20110106191901.000|20110106191903.000|TR0|various sources, and we are thankful to 
20110106191903.000|20110106191906.000|TR0|WBAL, our Baltimore affiliate, for getting 
20110106191906.000|20110106191908.000|TR0|us pictures of Hanover through their 
20110106191908.000|20110106191910.000|TR0|helicopter that you're looking at right 
20110106191910.000|20110106191913.000|TR0|now.  And for WTOP, our D.C. radio 
20110106191913.000|20110106191915.000|TR0|affiliate, who is doing a lot of the 
20110106191915.000|20110106191918.000|TR0|reporting on this to try to let us know 
20110106191918.000|20110106191920.000|TR0|what's going on.
20110106191920.000|20110106191922.000|TR0|
20110106191922.000|20110106191925.000|TR0|If you are out there and you do know 
20110106191925.000|20110106191927.000|TR0|what's going on, send me a tweet 
20110106191927.000|20110106191929.000|TR0|@AliVelshi, or post it up to my Facebook, 
20110106191929.000|20110106191932.000|TR0|and we will follow up on all of these 
20110106191932.000|20110106191934.000|TR0|leads to find out what exactly is going on 
20110106191934.000|20110106191937.000|TR0|there.
20110106191937.000|20110106191939.000|TR0|
20110106191939.000|20110106191941.000|TR0|This is Francis Street in Annapolis, 
20110106191941.000|20110106191944.000|TR0|Maryland, where the Annapolis explosion 
20110106191944.000|20110106191946.000|TR0|was.  In Baltimore, we're going to find 
20110106191946.000|20110106191949.000|TR0|out a little bit more information.
20110106191949.000|20110106191951.000|TR0|
20110106191951.000|20110106191953.000|TR0|Those of you who know the Maryland 
20110106191953.000|20110106191956.000|TR0|Department of Transportation building -- 
20110106191956.000|20110106191958.000|TR0|and I suppose if you're in that part of 
20110106191958.000|20110106192000.000|TR0|Maryland, it's sort of a building 
20110106192000.000|20110106192003.000|TR0|everybody will know because you have to go 
20110106192003.000|20110106192005.000|TR0|there probably for your licenses -- that's 
20110106192005.000|20110106192008.000|TR0|what we're looking at.  So we're 
20110106192008.000|20110106192010.000|TR0|alternating between the two spots.
20110106192010.000|20110106192012.000|TR0|
20110106192012.000|20110106192015.000|TR0|This is now Annapolis again  Two 
20110106192015.000|20110106192017.000|TR0|explosions inside state of Maryland 
20110106192017.000|20110106192019.000|TR0|government buildings.  Apparently, no 
20110106192019.000|20110106192022.000|TR0|injuries.
20110106192022.000|20110106192024.000|TR0|
20110106192024.000|20110106192027.000|TR0|We don't know what it was that blew up.  
20110106192027.000|20110106192029.000|TR0|But apparently, they took place inside 
20110106192029.000|20110106192031.000|TR0|government buildings.  Not the State House.
20110106192031.000|20110106192034.000|TR0|
20110106192034.000|20110106192036.000|TR0|We're showing you Annapolis.  And if you 
20110106192036.000|20110106192039.000|TR0|know Annapolis, that's sort of a big 
20110106192039.000|20110106192041.000|TR0|landmark there, other than the naval 
20110106192041.000|20110106192043.000|TR0|institutions.  But the State House is not 
20110106192043.000|20110106192046.000|TR0|where the explosion took place.  It took 
20110106192046.000|20110106192048.000|TR0|place on Francis Street, at the Jeffrey 
20110106192048.000|20110106192050.000|TR0|Building, which is home to the secretary 
20110106192050.000|20110106192053.000|TR0|of state, home to the homeland security 
20110106192053.000|20110106192055.000|TR0|offices there, and other -- numerous other 
20110106192055.000|20110106192058.000|TR0|offices.  We don't know yet exactly which 
20110106192058.000|20110106192100.000|TR0|other offices they are.
20110106192100.000|20110106192102.000|TR0|
20110106192102.000|20110106192105.000|TR0|Now, these two buildings are both state of 
20110106192105.000|20110106192107.000|TR0|Maryland building, the Department of 
20110106192107.000|20110106192110.000|TR0|Transportation headquarters, and a place 
20110106192110.000|20110106192112.000|TR0|where there would be other senior Maryland 
20110106192112.000|20110106192114.000|TR0|government officials.  So it is unclear 
20110106192114.000|20110106192117.000|TR0|what the motivation would be to target 
20110106192117.000|20110106192119.000|TR0|those two buildings.
20110106192119.000|20110106192121.000|TR0|
20110106192121.000|20110106192124.000|TR0|Annapolis, about -- less than an hour's 
20110106192124.000|20110106192126.000|TR0|drive from Washington, D.C.  Now you're 
20110106192126.000|20110106192129.000|TR0|looking at Hanover there and the complex 
20110106192129.000|20110106192131.000|TR0|that houses the Maryland Department of 
20110106192131.000|20110106192133.000|TR0|Transportation headquarters.
20110106192133.000|20110106192136.000|TR0|
20110106192136.000|20110106192138.000|TR0|So we have no information yet coming to us 
20110106192138.000|20110106192141.000|TR0|about what it is.
20110106192141.000|20110106192143.000|TR0|
20110106192143.000|20110106192145.000|TR0|Now, let me tell you more -- OK.  So we 
20110106192145.000|20110106192148.000|TR0|have been reporting -- again, this is all 
20110106192148.000|20110106192150.000|TR0|very, very new information.
20110106192150.000|20110106192152.000|TR0|
20110106192152.000|20110106192155.000|TR0|We've been reporting no injuries.  There 
20110106192155.000|20110106192157.000|TR0|are conflicting reports now that a mail 
20110106192157.000|20110106192200.000|TR0|room employee may have been injured.  We 
20110106192200.000|20110106192202.000|TR0|are working -- because this is breaking 
20110106192202.000|20110106192204.000|TR0|news, we are working to clarify 
20110106192204.000|20110106192207.000|TR0|information as we go along.
20110106192207.000|20110106192209.000|TR0|
20110106192209.000|20110106192211.000|TR0|But this is -- this may have happened at 
20110106192211.000|20110106192214.000|TR0|the State House in Annapolis.  Again, lots 
20110106192214.000|20110106192216.000|TR0|of conflicting information.
20110106192216.000|20110106192219.000|TR0|
20110106192219.000|20110106192221.000|TR0|We had first heard that the explosion was 
20110106192221.000|20110106192223.000|TR0|at the State House. We are now told it is 
20110106192223.000|20110106192226.000|TR0|at the Jeffrey Building, which is across 
20110106192226.000|20110106192228.000|TR0|the street from the State House on Francis 
20110106192228.000|20110106192231.000|TR0|Street.
20110106192231.000|20110106192233.000|TR0|
20110106192233.000|20110106192235.000|TR0|We do know that the bomb squad -- or this 
20110106192235.000|20110106192238.000|TR0|is what we're told -- was investigating 
20110106192238.000|20110106192240.000|TR0|the incident.  The FBI were on their way 
20110106192240.000|20110106192242.000|TR0|when the incident took place.
20110106192242.000|20110106192245.000|TR0|
20110106192245.000|20110106192247.000|TR0|This would have been about 1:00 Eastern.  
20110106192247.000|20110106192250.000|TR0|This is information that I'm getting from 
20110106192250.000|20110106192252.000|TR0|"The Baltimore Sun."
20110106192252.000|20110106192254.000|TR0|
20110106192254.000|20110106192257.000|TR0|But again, I have to tell you, this is -- 
20110106192257.000|20110106192259.000|TR0|we're getting new information momentarily, 
20110106192259.000|20110106192302.000|TR0|and some of it is conflicting.  So all we 
20110106192302.000|20110106192304.000|TR0|seem to know is that something blew up at 
20110106192304.000|20110106192306.000|TR0|the Annapolis -- the Jeffrey Building in 
20110106192306.000|20110106192309.000|TR0|Annapolis.
20110106192309.000|20110106192311.000|TR0|
20110106192311.000|20110106192313.000|TR0|There were also reports on the other 
20110106192313.000|20110106192316.000|TR0|picture.  This is -- this is -- are we 
20110106192316.000|20110106192318.000|TR0|still on Annapolis?  Let's see that WBAL 
20110106192318.000|20110106192321.000|TR0|picture for a second.
20110106192321.000|20110106192323.000|TR0|
20110106192323.000|20110106192325.000|TR0|This is the Maryland Department of 
20110106192325.000|20110106192328.000|TR0|Transportation.  Again, according to "The 
20110106192328.000|20110106192330.000|TR0|Baltimore Sun" -- and they're not -- 
20110106192330.000|20110106192333.000|TR0|they're saying that they got this from 
20110106192333.000|20110106192335.000|TR0|other media sources.  According to "The 
20110106192335.000|20110106192337.000|TR0|Baltimore Sun," there were injuries at the 
20110106192337.000|20110106192340.000|TR0|Maryland Department of Transportation.
20110106192340.000|20110106192342.000|TR0|
20110106192342.000|20110106192344.000|TR0|We're putting in calls to various people 
20110106192344.000|20110106192347.000|TR0|in these towns to find out what they know. 
20110106192347.000|20110106192349.000|TR0| Apparently, the fire department in the 
20110106192349.000|20110106192352.000|TR0|county may have been responding to an 
20110106192352.000|20110106192354.000|TR0|explosion when -- they don't know what it 
20110106192354.000|20110106192356.000|TR0|is.  They don't know what it is.  Initial 
20110106192356.000|20110106192359.000|TR0|reports say that it might have been a 
20110106192359.000|20110106192401.000|TR0|chemical explosion.
20110106192401.000|20110106192403.000|TR0|
20110106192403.000|20110106192406.000|TR0|OK.  Let's go back now to Annapolis for a 
20110106192406.000|20110106192408.000|TR0|second.  And I'll just keep on informing 
20110106192408.000|20110106192411.000|TR0|you of what I know, what new information 
20110106192411.000|20110106192413.000|TR0|is coming in.
20110106192413.000|20110106192415.000|TR0|
20110106192415.000|20110106192418.000|TR0|Again, these are all reports -- and I'm 
20110106192418.000|20110106192420.000|TR0|getting some information now through "The 
20110106192420.000|20110106192423.000|TR0|Baltimore Sun."  The Jeffrey Building, 
20110106192423.000|20110106192425.000|TR0|which is across from the State House in 
20110106192425.000|20110106192427.000|TR0|Annapolis, includes a number of 
20110106192427.000|20110106192430.000|TR0|gubernatorial staff offices, as well as 
20110106192430.000|20110106192432.000|TR0|the Office of Homeland Security, the 
20110106192432.000|20110106192434.000|TR0|Office of Appointments, and the secretary 
20110106192434.000|20110106192437.000|TR0|of state.
20110106192437.000|20110106192439.000|TR0|
20110106192439.000|20110106192442.000|TR0|So it's an important Maryland state 
20110106192442.000|20110106192444.000|TR0|building in Annapolis, Maryland, the state 
20110106192444.000|20110106192446.000|TR0|capital.  That is the State House.
20110106192446.000|20110106192449.000|TR0|
20110106192449.000|20110106192451.000|TR0|These are Google images that we're showing 
20110106192451.000|20110106192454.000|TR0|you.  Anybody who's been to Annapolis 
20110106192454.000|20110106192456.000|TR0|knows that that part of town is centered 
20110106192456.000|20110106192458.000|TR0|around the State House.  A slight incline, 
20110106192458.000|20110106192501.000|TR0|a bit of a hill to get up there, and 
20110106192501.000|20110106192503.000|TR0|government offices surround it.
20110106192503.000|20110106192505.000|TR0|
20110106192505.000|20110106192508.000|TR0|So, obviously in a case like this, there 
20110106192508.000|20110106192510.000|TR0|is going to be conflicting information, 
20110106192510.000|20110106192513.000|TR0|but we are trying to get as much new and 
20110106192513.000|20110106192515.000|TR0|accurate information as possible.  I've 
20110106192515.000|20110106192517.000|TR0|got everything open here.  So if you have 
20110106192517.000|20110106192520.000|TR0|information and you want to tweet me, 
20110106192520.000|20110106192522.000|TR0|@AliVelshi, if you're near there, let me 
20110106192522.000|20110106192525.000|TR0|know what you see.  Let me know what 
20110106192525.000|20110106192527.000|TR0|you're hearing or what you've even heard 
20110106192527.000|20110106192529.000|TR0|on local media outlets.
20110106192529.000|20110106192532.000|TR0|
20110106192532.000|20110106192534.000|TR0|So I'll update you with what we know now.
20110106192534.000|20110106192536.000|TR0|
20110106192536.000|20110106192539.000|TR0|You're looking at a picture of Hanover, 
20110106192539.000|20110106192541.000|TR0|Maryland.  This is coming to us from our 
20110106192541.000|20110106192544.000|TR0|affiliate WBAL.  And it is the parking 
20110106192544.000|20110106192546.000|TR0|area, the road, basically, outside of the 
20110106192546.000|20110106192548.000|TR0|Maryland Department of Transportation, 
20110106192548.000|20110106192551.000|TR0|where apparently there was an explosion.
20110106192551.000|20110106192553.000|TR0|
20110106192553.000|20110106192556.000|TR0|We do not know what exploded.  We had 
20110106192556.000|20110106192558.000|TR0|heard initially that there were no 
20110106192558.000|20110106192600.000|TR0|injuries at all.  We are hearing 
20110106192600.000|20110106192603.000|TR0|conflicting reports because that's what 
20110106192603.000|20110106192605.000|TR0|happens when things happen.  Various news 
20110106192605.000|20110106192607.000|TR0|organizations get different pieces of 
20110106192607.000|20110106192610.000|TR0|information.
20110106192610.000|20110106192612.000|TR0|
20110106192612.000|20110106192615.000|TR0|We have conflicting reports about injuries 
20110106192615.000|20110106192617.000|TR0|in both places.  So we don't know.
20110106192617.000|20110106192619.000|TR0|
20110106192619.000|20110106192622.000|TR0|In the case of the other location, in 
20110106192622.000|20110106192624.000|TR0|Annapolis, we heard reports that someone 
20110106192624.000|20110106192626.000|TR0|may have been injured in a mail room in 
20110106192626.000|20110106192629.000|TR0|the State House, but we're now learning 
20110106192629.000|20110106192631.000|TR0|that the explosion wasn't in the State 
20110106192631.000|20110106192634.000|TR0|House, it was across the road from the 
20110106192634.000|20110106192636.000|TR0|State House.
20110106192636.000|20110106192638.000|TR0|
20110106192638.000|20110106192641.000|TR0|I did receive a tweet from somebody whose 
20110106192641.000|20110106192643.000|TR0|dad works at the Naval Academy, the other 
20110106192643.000|20110106192646.000|TR0|big presence, obviously, in Annapolis, 
20110106192646.000|20110106192648.000|TR0|Maryland, and said they had heard no 
20110106192648.000|20110106192650.000|TR0|explosion, no idea of an explosion, or no 
20110106192650.000|20110106192653.000|TR0|information about the explosions.
20110106192653.000|20110106192655.000|TR0|
20110106192655.000|20110106192657.000|TR0|I'm just reading through my information to 
20110106192657.000|20110106192700.000|TR0|see if there's anything else that we have 
20110106192700.000|20110106192702.000|TR0|about these explosions.  OK.
20110106192702.000|20110106192705.000|TR0|
20110106192705.000|20110106192707.000|TR0|So what we're looking at there is -- we're 
20110106192707.000|20110106192709.000|TR0|pushing in on Google to Hanover, Maryland, 
20110106192709.000|20110106192712.000|TR0|the Maryland Department of Transportation. 
20110106192712.000|20110106192714.000|TR0| They are -- officials -- there seems to 
20110106192714.000|20110106192717.000|TR0|be some movement there.  There seems to be 
20110106192717.000|20110106192719.000|TR0|some people on the ground, but there 
20110106192719.000|20110106192721.000|TR0|doesn't seem to be anybody near the 
20110106192721.000|20110106192724.000|TR0|building at all.
20110106192724.000|20110106192726.000|TR0|
20110106192726.000|20110106192728.000|TR0|We showed you a picture of the Maryland 
20110106192728.000|20110106192731.000|TR0|Department of Transportation headquarters. 
20110106192731.000|20110106192733.000|TR0| It's seems to be completely devoid of 
20110106192733.000|20110106192736.000|TR0|activity at this point.  So whatever is 
20110106192736.000|20110106192738.000|TR0|happening doesn't seem to be happening 
20110106192738.000|20110106192740.000|TR0|with great urgency at the moment.  It 
20110106192740.000|20110106192743.000|TR0|seems to have been over an hour since this 
20110106192743.000|20110106192745.000|TR0|was first reported.
20110106192745.000|20110106192748.000|TR0|
20110106192748.000|20110106192750.000|TR0|Now we're getting more information from a 
20110106192750.000|20110106192752.000|TR0|different source that people have been 
20110106192752.000|20110106192755.000|TR0|injured at this particular one that you're 
20110106192755.000|20110106192757.000|TR0|looking at.  This is courtesy of our 
20110106192757.000|20110106192759.000|TR0|affiliate in Baltimore, WBAL.
20110106192759.000|20110106192802.000|TR0|
20110106192802.000|20110106192804.000|TR0|There are some reports that there have 
20110106192804.000|20110106192807.000|TR0|been injuries there. There are also 
20110106192807.000|20110106192809.000|TR0|reports that this may have been an 
20110106192809.000|20110106192811.000|TR0|improvised explosive device.
20110106192811.000|20110106192814.000|TR0|
20110106192814.000|20110106192816.000|TR0|Let's go to -- what town is that in, Kelly 
20110106192816.000|20110106192818.000|TR0|(ph)?  All right.
20110106192818.000|20110106192821.000|TR0|
20110106192821.000|20110106192823.000|TR0|I've got somebody on the phone.
20110106192823.000|20110106192826.000|TR0|
20110106192826.000|20110106192828.000|TR0|Josh Stewart, are you there?
20110106192828.000|20110106192830.000|TR0|
20110106192830.000|20110106192833.000|TR0|JOSH STEWART, "CAPITAL NEWSPAPER":  Yes, 
20110106192833.000|20110106192835.000|TR0|I'm here.  How are you doing?
20110106192835.000|20110106192838.000|TR0|
20110106192838.000|20110106192840.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Good, Josh.  Where are you?
20110106192840.000|20110106192842.000|TR0|
20110106192842.000|20110106192845.000|TR0|STEWART:  I am in downtown Annapolis, not 
20110106192845.000|20110106192847.000|TR0|too far from the state building.
20110106192847.000|20110106192849.000|TR0|
20110106192849.000|20110106192852.000|TR0|VELSHI:  OK.  Tell me what you know.
20110106192852.000|20110106192854.000|TR0|
20110106192854.000|20110106192857.000|TR0|STEWART:  Well, here's what's going on.  
20110106192857.000|20110106192859.000|TR0|There's been a suspicious package at a 
20110106192859.000|20110106192901.000|TR0|state office building right by the State 
20110106192901.000|20110106192904.000|TR0|House.  And there was some sort of an 
20110106192904.000|20110106192906.000|TR0|explosion.
20110106192906.000|20110106192909.000|TR0|
20110106192909.000|20110106192911.000|TR0|I'm not sure at this point how large it 
20110106192911.000|20110106192913.000|TR0|was.  And we're receiving conflicting 
20110106192913.000|20110106192916.000|TR0|reports about whether the person that 
20110106192916.000|20110106192918.000|TR0|opened the package in the mail room was 
20110106192918.000|20110106192920.000|TR0|injured.
20110106192920.000|20110106192923.000|TR0|
20110106192923.000|20110106192925.000|TR0|VELSHI:  OK.  Just give me a bit of the 
20110106192925.000|20110106192928.000|TR0|geography.
20110106192928.000|20110106192930.000|TR0|
20110106192930.000|20110106192932.000|TR0|We're looking at it right now on Google.  
20110106192932.000|20110106192935.000|TR0|We're looking at a view that shows me 
20110106192935.000|20110106192937.000|TR0|basically a lot of streets leading up to 
20110106192937.000|20110106192940.000|TR0|the state capitol, to the front entrance 
20110106192940.000|20110106192942.000|TR0|of the state capitol.
20110106192942.000|20110106192944.000|TR0|
20110106192944.000|20110106192947.000|TR0|Where would this Jeffrey Building be?  
20110106192947.000|20110106192949.000|TR0|Where is this Francis Street?
20110106192949.000|20110106192951.000|TR0|
20110106192951.000|20110106192954.000|TR0|STEWART:  Francis Street is -- if you're 
20110106192954.000|20110106192956.000|TR0|looking at Google Maps, and, you know, 
20110106192956.000|20110106192959.000|TR0|right down that State House, you can see 
20110106192959.000|20110106193001.000|TR0|on the one side what looks like a statue.
20110106193001.000|20110106193003.000|TR0|
20110106193003.000|20110106193006.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Yes.
20110106193006.000|20110106193008.000|TR0|
20110106193008.000|20110106193010.000|TR0|STEWART:  The statue is staring right down 
20110106193010.000|20110106193013.000|TR0|Francis Street.
20110106193013.000|20110106193015.000|TR0|
20110106193015.000|20110106193018.000|TR0|VELSHI:  OK.
20110106193018.000|20110106193020.000|TR0|
20110106193020.000|20110106193022.000|TR0|STEWART:  And you see Main Street, the big 
20110106193022.000|20110106193025.000|TR0|road there.  It's off to the right.
20110106193025.000|20110106193027.000|TR0|
20110106193027.000|20110106193030.000|TR0|VELSHI:  So if I'm looking at it, it's to 
20110106193030.000|20110106193032.000|TR0|the right of -- OK.  So we see it.  We've 
20110106193032.000|20110106193034.000|TR0|got a dot there that shows the Jeffrey 
20110106193034.000|20110106193037.000|TR0|Building.
20110106193037.000|20110106193039.000|TR0|
20110106193039.000|20110106193041.000|TR0|An important building?  A building that a 
20110106193041.000|20110106193044.000|TR0|lot of people spend a lot of time in 
20110106193044.000|20110106193046.000|TR0|during the day?
20110106193046.000|20110106193049.000|TR0|
20110106193049.000|20110106193051.000|TR0|STEWART:  You know, it's mostly state 
20110106193051.000|20110106193053.000|TR0|employees.  I mean, every now and then, 
20110106193053.000|20110106193056.000|TR0|you know, a regular citizen will have 
20110106193056.000|20110106193058.000|TR0|business there. But it's a lot of 
20110106193058.000|20110106193101.000|TR0|bureaucratic work that goes on there.
20110106193101.000|20110106193103.000|TR0|
20110106193103.000|20110106193105.000|TR0|The Department of State is there, and they 
20110106193105.000|20110106193108.000|TR0|do a lot of paperwork related to some of 
20110106193108.000|20110106193110.000|TR0|the corporate filings and stuff like that. 
20110106193110.000|20110106193112.000|TR0| But it's not a place like the DMV, where 
20110106193112.000|20110106193115.000|TR0|everyone has business.
20110106193115.000|20110106193117.000|TR0|
20110106193117.000|20110106193120.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  And the other explosion 
20110106193120.000|20110106193122.000|TR0|we're hearing about in Hanover is at a 
20110106193122.000|20110106193124.000|TR0|Department of Transportation office.  
20110106193124.000|20110106193127.000|TR0|Again, it looks like an office building, 
20110106193127.000|20110106193129.000|TR0|so I don't know whether they do things 
20110106193129.000|20110106193132.000|TR0|like licenses and things like that.  But 
20110106193132.000|20110106193134.000|TR0|this is not necessarily a public building, 
20110106193134.000|20110106193136.000|TR0|the Jeffrey Building, but it is obviously 
20110106193136.000|20110106193139.000|TR0|home to a number of important offices.  
20110106193139.000|20110106193141.000|TR0|We're hearing about the Office of Homeland 
20110106193141.000|20110106193143.000|TR0|Security and the secretary of state in 
20110106193143.000|20110106193146.000|TR0|Maryland.
20110106193146.000|20110106193148.000|TR0|
20110106193148.000|20110106193151.000|TR0|Josh, please stand by.  See what 
20110106193151.000|20110106193153.000|TR0|information you can gather on this, 
20110106193153.000|20110106193155.000|TR0|because we need to get some new 
20110106193155.000|20110106193158.000|TR0|information.
20110106193158.000|20110106193200.000|TR0|
20110106193200.000|20110106193202.000|TR0|I'm going to just take us over now to the 
20110106193202.000|20110106193205.000|TR0|president of the United States with his 
20110106193205.000|20110106193207.000|TR0|announcement about William Daley.

20110106193214.000|20110106193217.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110106193217.000|20110106193219.000|TR0|STATES:  -- most trusted aides to step 
20110106193219.000|20110106193222.000|TR0|into the breach and lead us through a very 
20110106193222.000|20110106193224.000|TR0|difficult time.  And I also ask Pete to 
20110106193224.000|20110106193226.000|TR0|help us think about how the White House 
20110106193226.000|20110106193229.000|TR0|should be structured and run over the next 
20110106193229.000|20110106193231.000|TR0|two years.
20110106193231.000|20110106193233.000|TR0|
20110106193233.000|20110106193236.000|TR0|Thanks in no small part to his efforts, a 
20110106193236.000|20110106193238.000|TR0|period that everybody thought would be one 
20110106193238.000|20110106193241.000|TR0|of retrenchment turned out to be one of 
20110106193241.000|20110106193243.000|TR0|great progress for our country.  And 
20110106193243.000|20110106193245.000|TR0|Pete's leadership is all the more 
20110106193245.000|20110106193248.000|TR0|remarkable when you consider that when I 
20110106193248.000|20110106193250.000|TR0|first met him and asked him to lead my 
20110106193250.000|20110106193253.000|TR0|Senate staff, he told me in that gruff 
20110106193253.000|20110106193255.000|TR0|voice of his that his strong inclination 
20110106193255.000|20110106193257.000|TR0|was to leave government.
20110106193257.000|20110106193300.000|TR0|
20110106193300.000|20110106193302.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110106193302.000|20110106193304.000|TR0|
20110106193304.000|20110106193307.000|TR0|OBAMA:  The reason everybody is applauding 
20110106193307.000|20110106193309.000|TR0|is because they've heard him say that 
20110106193309.000|20110106193312.000|TR0|every day -
20110106193312.000|20110106193314.000|TR0|

20110106193319.000|20110106193321.000|TR0|OBAMA:  -- they've heard him say that 
20110106193321.000|20110106193324.000|TR0|everyday for the last six years.  And yet 
20110106193324.000|20110106193326.000|TR0|each time I have asked him to accept one 
20110106193326.000|20110106193328.000|TR0|more assignment, he's saddled up and he's 
20110106193328.000|20110106193331.000|TR0|taken the job.  And it's fair to say that 
20110106193331.000|20110106193333.000|TR0|I would not be where I am today without 
20110106193333.000|20110106193335.000|TR0|his extraordinary counsel.
20110106193335.000|20110106193338.000|TR0|
20110106193338.000|20110106193340.000|TR0|Pete didn't volunteer to serve as interim 
20110106193340.000|20110106193343.000|TR0|chief of staff.  He made it clear that 
20110106193343.000|20110106193345.000|TR0|that was not his preference, but he 
20110106193345.000|20110106193347.000|TR0|accepted the responsibility.  And as he 
20110106193347.000|20110106193350.000|TR0|oversaw our strategy during the lame duck 
20110106193350.000|20110106193352.000|TR0|session of Congress, he also was working 
20110106193352.000|20110106193354.000|TR0|to develop a structure and a plan for the 
20110106193354.000|20110106193357.000|TR0|next two years that I believe will serve 
20110106193357.000|20110106193359.000|TR0|the White House and more importantly, the 
20110106193359.000|20110106193402.000|TR0|American people very well.  One of those 
20110106193402.000|20110106193404.000|TR0|assignments was providing me 
20110106193404.000|20110106193406.000|TR0|recommendations for candidates to serve as 
20110106193406.000|20110106193409.000|TR0|chief of staff moving forward.
20110106193409.000|20110106193411.000|TR0|
20110106193411.000|20110106193414.000|TR0|As part of that process, today I am proud 
20110106193414.000|20110106193416.000|TR0|to announce the appointment of an 
20110106193416.000|20110106193418.000|TR0|experienced public servant, a devoted 
20110106193418.000|20110106193421.000|TR0|patriot, my friend, fellow Chicagoan, Bill 
20110106193421.000|20110106193423.000|TR0|Daley to serve as my chief of staff.
20110106193423.000|20110106193425.000|TR0|

20110106193430.000|20110106193433.000|TR0|OBAMA:  Few Americans can boast the 
20110106193433.000|20110106193435.000|TR0|breadth of experience that Bill brings to 
20110106193435.000|20110106193437.000|TR0|this job.  He's served as a member of 
20110106193437.000|20110106193440.000|TR0|President Clinton's cabinet as commerce 
20110106193440.000|20110106193442.000|TR0|secretary.  He took on several other 
20110106193442.000|20110106193445.000|TR0|important duties on behalf of our country. 
20110106193445.000|20110106193447.000|TR0| He's led major corporations.  He 
20110106193447.000|20110106193449.000|TR0|possesses a deep understanding of how jobs 
20110106193449.000|20110106193452.000|TR0|are created and how to grow our economy.
20110106193452.000|20110106193454.000|TR0|
20110106193454.000|20110106193456.000|TR0|And needless to say, Bill also has a 
20110106193456.000|20110106193459.000|TR0|smidgen of awareness of how our system of 
20110106193459.000|20110106193501.000|TR0|government and politics works.  You might 
20110106193501.000|20110106193504.000|TR0|say it is a genetic trait.  But most of 
20110106193504.000|20110106193506.000|TR0|all, I know Bill to be somebody who cares 
20110106193506.000|20110106193508.000|TR0|deeply about this country.  Believes in 
20110106193508.000|20110106193511.000|TR0|its promise and considers no calling 
20110106193511.000|20110106193513.000|TR0|higher and more important than serving the 
20110106193513.000|20110106193516.000|TR0|American people. He will bring his 
20110106193516.000|20110106193518.000|TR0|tremendous experience, his strong values, 
20110106193518.000|20110106193520.000|TR0|and forward-looking vision to this White 
20110106193520.000|20110106193523.000|TR0|House.  I'm convinced that he'll help us 
20110106193523.000|20110106193525.000|TR0|in our mission of growing our economy and 
20110106193525.000|20110106193527.000|TR0|moving America forward, and I very much 
20110106193527.000|20110106193530.000|TR0|look forward to working with Bill in the 
20110106193530.000|20110106193532.000|TR0|years to come.
20110106193532.000|20110106193535.000|TR0|
20110106193535.000|20110106193537.000|TR0|Before I ask Bill to say a few words, I 
20110106193537.000|20110106193539.000|TR0|should also confess that I have prevailed 
20110106193539.000|20110106193542.000|TR0|once again on Pete's sense of duty or 
20110106193542.000|20110106193544.000|TR0|sense of guilt, I'm not sure which.  And 
20110106193544.000|20110106193547.000|TR0|I'm grateful that he has agreed to one 
20110106193547.000|20110106193549.000|TR0|more tour of duty as my counselor for the 
20110106193549.000|20110106193551.000|TR0|next two years.
20110106193551.000|20110106193554.000|TR0|

20110106193558.000|20110106193601.000|TR0|OBAMA:  Now, as you might have noticed, 
20110106193601.000|20110106193603.000|TR0|people like Pete.  He is a unique and 
20110106193603.000|20110106193606.000|TR0|indespensible asset to me and this 
20110106193606.000|20110106193608.000|TR0|administration.  I cannot imagine life 
20110106193608.000|20110106193610.000|TR0|here without him.  And I told him so.  And 
20110106193610.000|20110106193613.000|TR0|I'm delighted that we're able to keep him 
20110106193613.000|20110106193615.000|TR0|a little bit longer.
20110106193615.000|20110106193617.000|TR0|
20110106193617.000|20110106193620.000|TR0|I'll be making further announcements in 
20110106193620.000|20110106193622.000|TR0|the days and weeks ahead. And I am 
20110106193622.000|20110106193625.000|TR0|absolutely confident that we will have a 
20110106193625.000|20110106193627.000|TR0|great team that's equal to America's task 
20110106193627.000|20110106193629.000|TR0|in the years to come.  But with that, what 
20110106193629.000|20110106193632.000|TR0|I'd like to do is to introduce my new 
20110106193632.000|20110106193634.000|TR0|chief of staff, Bill Daley.

20110106193708.000|20110106193710.000|TR0|Fifty years ago this month, I visited the 
20110106193710.000|20110106193712.000|TR0|White House with my parents.  And my 
20110106193712.000|20110106193715.000|TR0|brothers and sisters to visit a young 
20110106193715.000|20110106193717.000|TR0|president who went on to show great 
20110106193717.000|20110106193719.000|TR0|strength, leadership and vision in the 
20110106193719.000|20110106193722.000|TR0|face of enormous challenges in those 
20110106193722.000|20110106193724.000|TR0|times.  You, Mr. President, have proven 
20110106193724.000|20110106193727.000|TR0|your strength, your leadership, your 
20110106193727.000|20110106193729.000|TR0|vision during a most difficult time for 
20110106193729.000|20110106193731.000|TR0|our nation and for the world.  You have 
20110106193731.000|20110106193734.000|TR0|also shown through your example that 
20110106193734.000|20110106193736.000|TR0|public service is an honorable calling, 
20110106193736.000|20110106193739.000|TR0|and I am pleased to answer your call.
20110106193739.000|20110106193741.000|TR0|
20110106193741.000|20110106193743.000|TR0|I look forward to working with the 
20110106193743.000|20110106193746.000|TR0|wonderful staff, which you have assembled. 
20110106193746.000|20110106193748.000|TR0| I know my job will be made easier by the 
20110106193748.000|20110106193750.000|TR0|great work and direction of Pete Rouse.  
20110106193750.000|20110106193753.000|TR0|The direction and great work he has 
20110106193753.000|20110106193755.000|TR0|provided over these past couple of months, 
20110106193755.000|20110106193758.000|TR0|and the president talked about the 
20110106193758.000|20110106193800.000|TR0|enormous successes under Pete's watch.     
20110106193800.000|20110106193802.000|TR0|  Pete, too, has dedicated his life to 
20110106193802.000|20110106193805.000|TR0|public service and to our nation, and I am 
20110106193805.000|20110106193807.000|TR0|grateful for his efforts and I am proud to 
20110106193807.000|20110106193809.000|TR0|call him my colleague.  I assure you, Mr. 
20110106193809.000|20110106193812.000|TR0|President, as they have done in the last 
20110106193812.000|20110106193814.000|TR0|two years, that this team will not let you 
20110106193814.000|20110106193817.000|TR0|down, nor the nation. Thank you very much 
20110106193817.000|20110106193819.000|TR0|for this extreme honor.
20110106193819.000|20110106193821.000|TR0|
20110106193821.000|20110106193824.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110106193824.000|20110106193826.000|TR0|
20110106193826.000|20110106193829.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Okay.  President Obama announcing 
20110106193829.000|20110106193831.000|TR0|William Daley, former commerce secretary, 
20110106193831.000|20110106193833.000|TR0|son of long-time Chicago mayor -- as his 
20110106193833.000|20110106193836.000|TR0|new chief of staff.  And congratulating 
20110106193836.000|20110106193838.000|TR0|Pete Rouse, who came in as interim chief 
20110106193838.000|20110106193840.000|TR0|of staff after Rahm Emmanuel, decided that 
20110106193840.000|20110106193843.000|TR0|he is going to leave, go back to Chicago 
20110106193843.000|20110106193845.000|TR0|to run for mayor.  So, remarkable 
20110106193845.000|20110106193848.000|TR0|interconnectiveness with Chicago, the 
20110106193848.000|20110106193850.000|TR0|place where the president has lived for a 
20110106193850.000|20110106193852.000|TR0|long time.
20110106193852.000|20110106193855.000|TR0|
20110106193855.000|20110106193857.000|TR0|All right.  Let's go back to that other 
20110106193857.000|20110106193900.000|TR0|story that we are following.  I'll give 
20110106193900.000|20110106193902.000|TR0|you an update on the two explosions that 
20110106193902.000|20110106193904.000|TR0|have taken place in the -- in Maryland.  
20110106193904.000|20110106193907.000|TR0|This picture is coming to us from WBAL.  
20110106193907.000|20110106193909.000|TR0|It is in Hanover, Maryland.  Outside of 
20110106193909.000|20110106193911.000|TR0|the headquarters of the Maryland 
20110106193911.000|20110106193914.000|TR0|Department of Transportation.
20110106193914.000|20110106193916.000|TR0|
20110106193916.000|20110106193919.000|TR0|Here's what we know.  This is one of two 
20110106193919.000|20110106193921.000|TR0|explosions that have taken place.  A 
20110106193921.000|20110106193923.000|TR0|Maryland state government official has 
20110106193923.000|20110106193926.000|TR0|told CNN there are some injuries in the 
20110106193926.000|20110106193928.000|TR0|incidents.  He describes them as very 
20110106193928.000|20110106193931.000|TR0|minor. There are two packages.  Basically, 
20110106193931.000|20110106193933.000|TR0|one of them went to the building we were 
20110106193933.000|20110106193935.000|TR0|just showing you, that site that we were 
20110106193935.000|20110106193938.000|TR0|just showing you. This is the Maryland 
20110106193938.000|20110106193940.000|TR0|Department of Transportation headquarters. 
20110106193940.000|20110106193942.000|TR0|That's the building on the right side.  
20110106193942.000|20110106193945.000|TR0|One went to that mailroom.
20110106193945.000|20110106193947.000|TR0|
20110106193947.000|20110106193950.000|TR0|The other one went to the Jeffrey 
20110106193950.000|20110106193952.000|TR0|building, which is a block away, across 
20110106193952.000|20110106193954.000|TR0|the road from the state house in 
20110106193954.000|20110106193957.000|TR0|Annapolis, Maryland. There's the state 
20110106193957.000|20110106193959.000|TR0|house you're looking at.  You see the red 
20110106193959.000|20110106194001.000|TR0|dot, just a little below that, that's the 
20110106194001.000|20110106194004.000|TR0|Jeffrey Building.  We are told that they 
20110106194004.000|20110106194006.000|TR0|were not big explosions.  They were 
20110106194006.000|20110106194009.000|TR0|packages.  We don't know what the packages 
20110106194009.000|20110106194011.000|TR0|are.  Both buildings have been evacuated.
20110106194011.000|20110106194013.000|TR0|
20110106194013.000|20110106194016.000|TR0|A source has told CNN that -- something 
20110106194016.000|20110106194018.000|TR0|happened.  They detonated, flame was 
20110106194018.000|20110106194021.000|TR0|emitted.  The source talking to CNN felt 
20110106194021.000|20110106194023.000|TR0|that it might be too strong to call them 
20110106194023.000|20110106194025.000|TR0|blasts.  But we still have details coming 
20110106194025.000|20110106194028.000|TR0|in.  One of the details we have coming in 
20110106194028.000|20110106194030.000|TR0|is that Annapolis, there may be one injury 
20110106194030.000|20110106194032.000|TR0|there as well.  There do appear to be some 
20110106194032.000|20110106194035.000|TR0|injuries.
20110106194035.000|20110106194037.000|TR0|
20110106194037.000|20110106194040.000|TR0|Let's go to Jeanne Meserve who is 
20110106194040.000|20110106194042.000|TR0|following this along with us from 
20110106194042.000|20110106194044.000|TR0|Washington.  Jeanne, what do you know?
20110106194044.000|20110106194047.000|TR0|
20110106194047.000|20110106194049.000|TR0|JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY 
20110106194049.000|20110106194052.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ali, what we're 
20110106194052.000|20110106194054.000|TR0|hearing is that explosion might be too 
20110106194054.000|20110106194056.000|TR0|strong a word to describe what happened 
20110106194056.000|20110106194059.000|TR0|with these two packages.  However, they 
20110106194059.000|20110106194101.000|TR0|did ignite.  These devices went off.  
20110106194101.000|20110106194103.000|TR0|We're told by one law enforcement source 
20110106194103.000|20110106194106.000|TR0|that flames were emitted.  One individual 
20110106194106.000|20110106194108.000|TR0|was trying to deal with one of the 
20110106194108.000|20110106194111.000|TR0|packages and did at least -- one person 
20110106194111.000|20110106194113.000|TR0|sustained injuries.  Those were burns to 
20110106194113.000|20110106194115.000|TR0|their hands.
20110106194115.000|20110106194118.000|TR0|
20110106194118.000|20110106194120.000|TR0|Now, this is a Maryland incident.  The 
20110106194120.000|20110106194123.000|TR0|Maryland State Police are taking the lead. 
20110106194123.000|20110106194125.000|TR0| The FBI is also responding.  The 
20110106194125.000|20110106194127.000|TR0|Department of Homeland Security says it is 
20110106194127.000|20110106194130.000|TR0|aware.  It's closely monitoring reports, 
20110106194130.000|20110106194132.000|TR0|but at this point in time, this is a 
20110106194132.000|20110106194134.000|TR0|Maryland state incident at this point.  
20110106194134.000|20110106194137.000|TR0|These two devices, the only ones we've 
20110106194137.000|20110106194139.000|TR0|heard about so far, Ali.
20110106194139.000|20110106194142.000|TR0|
20110106194142.000|20110106194144.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Okay, Jeanne.  Stand by.  Let's 
20110106194144.000|20110106194146.000|TR0|bring Fran Townsend in. She's a national 
20110106194146.000|20110106194149.000|TR0|security contributor, joining us from New 
20110106194149.000|20110106194151.000|TR0|York.
20110106194151.000|20110106194153.000|TR0|
20110106194153.000|20110106194156.000|TR0|Fran, what I haven't told our viewers, if 
20110106194156.000|20110106194158.000|TR0|they've just joined us, is that the 
20110106194158.000|20110106194201.000|TR0|Jeffrey Building, the one in Annapolis, 
20110106194201.000|20110106194203.000|TR0|across from the state house, housed 
20110106194203.000|20110106194205.000|TR0|homeland security and it housed the 
20110106194205.000|20110106194208.000|TR0|secretary of state.  The other building 
20110106194208.000|20110106194210.000|TR0|was the -- in Hanover, Maryland, was the 
20110106194210.000|20110106194213.000|TR0|Maryland department of Transportation 
20110106194213.000|20110106194215.000|TR0|headquarters.
20110106194215.000|20110106194217.000|TR0|
20110106194217.000|20110106194220.000|TR0|What comes to your mind when you hear 
20110106194220.000|20110106194222.000|TR0|these two places as targets?  What does 
20110106194222.000|20110106194224.000|TR0|that mean?
20110106194224.000|20110106194227.000|TR0|
20110106194227.000|20110106194229.000|TR0|FRAN TOWNSEND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY 
20110106194229.000|20110106194232.000|TR0|CONTRIBUTOR (via phone): You know, it's 
20110106194232.000|20110106194234.000|TR0|really hard to understand or explain right 
20110106194234.000|20110106194236.000|TR0|now, Ali.  I was talking to a very senior 
20110106194236.000|20110106194239.000|TR0|law enforcement source, federal law 
20110106194239.000|20110106194241.000|TR0|enforcement source who had firsthand 
20110106194241.000|20110106194244.000|TR0|knowledge of the investigation. He said, 
20110106194244.000|20110106194246.000|TR0|look, these packages ignited.  As Jeanne 
20110106194246.000|20110106194248.000|TR0|just pointed out, too strong to probably 
20110106194248.000|20110106194251.000|TR0|call it a blast.  But this was just a 
20110106194251.000|20110106194253.000|TR0|surprise. Suggesting to me, Ali, that it 
20110106194253.000|20110106194255.000|TR0|wasn't related to an ongoing investigation 
20110106194255.000|20110106194258.000|TR0|that they know of yet.
20110106194258.000|20110106194300.000|TR0|
20110106194300.000|20110106194303.000|TR0|Clearly, as Maryland -- Maryland are the 
20110106194303.000|20110106194305.000|TR0|first responders.  The federal officials 
20110106194305.000|20110106194307.000|TR0|are now trying to look at this and figure 
20110106194307.000|20110106194310.000|TR0|out do we know anything that might be 
20110106194310.000|20110106194312.000|TR0|useful to help Maryland as they continue 
20110106194312.000|20110106194315.000|TR0|to try and understand who might be behind 
20110106194315.000|20110106194317.000|TR0|this and why those particular buildings.
20110106194317.000|20110106194319.000|TR0|
20110106194319.000|20110106194322.000|TR0|VELHSI:  Fran, stand by.  Let's go back to 
20110106194322.000|20110106194324.000|TR0|Jeanne Meserve. Jeanne, what have you got?
20110106194324.000|20110106194326.000|TR0|
20110106194326.000|20110106194329.000|TR0|MESERVE:  We've got new information from a 
20110106194329.000|20110106194331.000|TR0|government source. According to this 
20110106194331.000|20110106194334.000|TR0|individual, the package at the Jeffrey 
20110106194334.000|20110106194336.000|TR0|Street address flashed with a little bit 
20110106194336.000|20110106194338.000|TR0|of fire.  The package emitted what was 
20110106194338.000|20110106194341.000|TR0|described as a s sulfur smell.  A person 
20110106194341.000|20110106194343.000|TR0|there was slightly injured.
20110106194343.000|20110106194346.000|TR0|
20110106194346.000|20110106194348.000|TR0|The other package was at the Maryland 
20110106194348.000|20110106194350.000|TR0|Department of Transportation headquarters, 
20110106194350.000|20110106194353.000|TR0|as you know, near BWI airport.  That 
20110106194353.000|20110106194355.000|TR0|resulted in an injury, we're told.  
20110106194355.000|20110106194357.000|TR0|According to this source, the reports of 
20110106194357.000|20110106194400.000|TR0|these two devices came in not 
20110106194400.000|20110106194402.000|TR0|simultaneously but very close.
20110106194402.000|20110106194405.000|TR0|
20110106194405.000|20110106194407.000|TR0|Precautions have been taken at state 
20110106194407.000|20110106194409.000|TR0|facilities all across Maryland.  The FBI, 
20110106194409.000|20110106194412.000|TR0|Maryland state police and the Maryland 
20110106194412.000|20110106194414.000|TR0|fire marshals are now all responding to 
20110106194414.000|20110106194416.000|TR0|these incidents.  But we should caution 
20110106194416.000|20110106194419.000|TR0|you here, these are early reports.  Early 
20110106194419.000|20110106194421.000|TR0|reports, as I know -- Fran can tell us 
20110106194421.000|20110106194424.000|TR0|better than anyone are often incorrect.  
20110106194424.000|20110106194426.000|TR0|But that's the early picture we're getting 
20110106194426.000|20110106194428.000|TR0|now.
20110106194428.000|20110106194431.000|TR0|
20110106194431.000|20110106194433.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Well, that's -- thank you, 
20110106194433.000|20110106194436.000|TR0|Jeanne.  You work in a beat, Jeanne, where 
20110106194436.000|20110106194438.000|TR0|you're often called upon to talk about 
20110106194438.000|20110106194440.000|TR0|things where we have very little 
20110106194440.000|20110106194443.000|TR0|information.       Fran, I'm just looking 
20110106194443.000|20110106194445.000|TR0|at my some tweets.  Some of them are 
20110106194445.000|20110106194447.000|TR0|helping me out, gathering information.  
20110106194447.000|20110106194450.000|TR0|Other people are saying, don't you guys 
20110106194450.000|20110106194452.000|TR0|know what you're talking about?  This is 
20110106194452.000|20110106194455.000|TR0|exactly the case, though.  When you have 
20110106194455.000|20110106194457.000|TR0|things like this, you have something 
20110106194457.000|20110106194459.000|TR0|detonating or flames coming out of it at 
20110106194459.000|20110106194502.000|TR0|two different buildings not terribly far 
20110106194502.000|20110106194504.000|TR0|from each other.  At what point does the 
20110106194504.000|20110106194507.000|TR0|information become solid where we have a 
20110106194507.000|20110106194509.000|TR0|sense of whether this was a terror attack? 
20110106194509.000|20110106194511.000|TR0| Was it someone with a gripe?  How do you 
20110106194511.000|20110106194514.000|TR0|make sense of fast moving information like 
20110106194514.000|20110106194516.000|TR0|this?
20110106194516.000|20110106194518.000|TR0|
20110106194518.000|20110106194521.000|TR0|TOWNSEND:  Ali, the first thing they're 
20110106194521.000|20110106194523.000|TR0|going to try to do is try to look at the 
20110106194523.000|20110106194526.000|TR0|remnants, what's left of each of these 
20110106194526.000|20110106194528.000|TR0|devices. They'll look at the 
20110106194528.000|20110106194530.000|TR0|sophistication, they'll look at what was 
20110106194530.000|20110106194533.000|TR0|the detonation device, what was the 
20110106194533.000|20110106194535.000|TR0|material used to get the flash or the 
20110106194535.000|20110106194538.000|TR0|ignition.   And all of that will tell you 
20110106194538.000|20110106194540.000|TR0|something more about the bombmaker.
20110106194540.000|20110106194542.000|TR0|
20110106194542.000|20110106194545.000|TR0|Was it a disgruntled employee?  Or was 
20110106194545.000|20110106194547.000|TR0|this some organized group that had some 
20110106194547.000|20110106194549.000|TR0|agenda or message that they were trying to 
20110106194549.000|20110106194552.000|TR0|get out?  You know, until we know more 
20110106194552.000|20110106194554.000|TR0|from the scenes, from the actual the facts 
20110106194554.000|20110106194557.000|TR0|of the investigation, it's hard to know 
20110106194557.000|20110106194559.000|TR0|which this would be.
20110106194559.000|20110106194601.000|TR0|
20110106194601.000|20110106194604.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Okay.  We'll continue to lean on 
20110106194604.000|20110106194606.000|TR0|you and Jeanne Meserve. Fran Townsend and 
20110106194606.000|20110106194608.000|TR0|Jeanne Meserve, thanks very much for 
20110106194608.000|20110106194611.000|TR0|helping us out on this.  We'll keep an eye 
20110106194611.000|20110106194613.000|TR0|on this situation, obviously.  As we get 
20110106194613.000|20110106194616.000|TR0|more information on these two explosions 
20110106194616.000|20110106194618.000|TR0|-- whatever they were, these two - 
20110106194618.000|20110106194620.000|TR0|something -- that happened at two Maryland 
20110106194620.000|20110106194623.000|TR0|government buildings, we'll bring that 
20110106194623.000|20110106194625.000|TR0|back to you as soon as we have it.
20110106194625.000|20110106194628.000|TR0|
20110106194628.000|20110106194630.000|TR0|We're going to take a quick break.  We'll 
20110106194630.000|20110106194632.000|TR0|be right back.
20110106194632.000|20110106194635.000|TR0|
20110106194635.000|20110106194637.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110106194637.000|20110106194639.000|TR0|
20110106194639.000|20110106194642.000|TR0|VELSHI:  OK.  Continuing our coverage, 
20110106194642.000|20110106194644.000|TR0|there have been two reports of packages 
20110106194644.000|20110106194647.000|TR0|exploding in state government buildings.  
20110106194647.000|20110106194649.000|TR0|One incident occurred at the Jeffrey 
20110106194649.000|20110106194651.000|TR0|Building in Annapolis.  Across the street 
20110106194651.000|20110106194654.000|TR0|from the state house on Francis Street.  
20110106194654.000|20110106194656.000|TR0|It houses offices of a number of the 
20110106194656.000|20110106194659.000|TR0|governor's staff, including the secretary 
20110106194659.000|20110106194701.000|TR0|of state and the office of homeland 
20110106194701.000|20110106194703.000|TR0|security.
20110106194703.000|20110106194706.000|TR0|
20110106194706.000|20110106194708.000|TR0|The other blast occurred at the Maryland 
20110106194708.000|20110106194710.000|TR0|Department of Transportation building that 
20110106194710.000|20110106194713.000|TR0|you're looking at pictures of it now 
20110106194713.000|20110106194715.000|TR0|courtesy of our affiliate, WBAL.  And that 
20110106194715.000|20110106194718.000|TR0|explosion occurred at the headquarters of 
20110106194718.000|20110106194720.000|TR0|the Maryland Department of Transportation. 
20110106194720.000|20110106194722.000|TR0| There are conflicting reports as to 
20110106194722.000|20110106194725.000|TR0|whether anyone was hurt in these 
20110106194725.000|20110106194727.000|TR0|incidents. We are getting some reports 
20110106194727.000|20110106194730.000|TR0|from government officials that there were 
20110106194730.000|20110106194732.000|TR0|minor injuries in both of them, although 
20110106194732.000|20110106194734.000|TR0|some dispute as to whether they are -- how 
20110106194734.000|20110106194737.000|TR0|you characterize these, as blasts or 
20110106194737.000|20110106194739.000|TR0|explosions.  But something detonated and 
20110106194739.000|20110106194741.000|TR0|there were flames involved.
20110106194741.000|20110106194744.000|TR0|
20110106194744.000|20110106194746.000|TR0|We'll keep you updated on details of this 
20110106194746.000|20110106194749.000|TR0|as we get them.  But please continue to 
20110106194749.000|20110106194751.000|TR0|send us information as you have it.  You 
20110106194751.000|20110106194753.000|TR0|can tweet me @alivelshi.  Or go to my blog

20110106194800.000|20110106194803.000|TR0|Some other top stories we are following. 
20110106194803.000|20110106194805.000|TR0|President Obama has announced that he has 
20110106194805.000|20110106194808.000|TR0|tapped William Daley to be his new chief 
20110106194808.000|20110106194810.000|TR0|of staff.  Two senior officials say -- 
20110106194810.000|20110106194812.000|TR0|well, Bill Daley was named as President 
20110106194812.000|20110106194815.000|TR0|Obama's chief of staff just moments ago.  
20110106194815.000|20110106194817.000|TR0|He's the top executive with JP Morgan 
20110106194817.000|20110106194820.000|TR0|Chase and a former commerce secretary.  
20110106194820.000|20110106194822.000|TR0|His appointment is seen as a sign that the 
20110106194822.000|20110106194824.000|TR0|president is trying to build his ties - or 
20110106194824.000|20110106194827.000|TR0|rebuild his ties with corporate America.  
20110106194827.000|20110106194829.000|TR0|We will continue to bring you more 
20110106194829.000|20110106194831.000|TR0|information on that.
20110106194831.000|20110106194834.000|TR0|
20110106194834.000|20110106194836.000|TR0|The U.S. military plans to keep pressures 
20110106194836.000|20110106194839.000|TR0|on the -- pressure on the Taliban in 
20110106194839.000|20110106194841.000|TR0|Afghanistan by sending in more troops.  
20110106194841.000|20110106194843.000|TR0|Military officials tell CNN 1,400 Marines 
20110106194843.000|20110106194846.000|TR0|will head that way soon.  They'll be in 
20110106194846.000|20110106194848.000|TR0|country for a few months to boost security 
20110106194848.000|20110106194851.000|TR0|efforts in southern Afghanistan and help 
20110106194851.000|20110106194853.000|TR0|counter a Taliban offensive ahead of 
20110106194853.000|20110106194855.000|TR0|mandated U.S. troop reductions.

20110106194858.000|20110106194900.000|TR0|Repealing health care reform could add 
20110106194900.000|20110106194902.000|TR0|about $230 billion to the federal deficit. 
20110106194902.000|20110106194905.000|TR0| That's their preliminary assessment from 
20110106194905.000|20110106194907.000|TR0|the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
20110106194907.000|20110106194910.000|TR0|Office.  But new House speaker John 
20110106194910.000|20110106194912.000|TR0|Boehner is not buying that.  He's planning 
20110106194912.000|20110106194914.000|TR0|to push ahead with repealing the 
20110106194914.000|20110106194917.000|TR0|legislation as Republicans promised to do 
20110106194917.000|20110106194919.000|TR0|during the midterm elections.

20110106194924.000|20110106194926.000|TR0|unusually serious.  An update on the human 
20110106194926.000|20110106194929.000|TR0|cost of Arizona's Medicaid cuts.  We asked 
20110106194929.000|20110106194931.000|TR0|for your thoughts.  I'll check some of

20110106194941.000|20110106194943.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Since Arizona eliminated Medicaid 
20110106194943.000|20110106194945.000|TR0|coverage for many organ transplants three 
20110106194945.000|20110106194948.000|TR0|months ago, we've seen two people needing 
20110106194948.000|20110106194950.000|TR0|transplants die.  I asked you guys to 
20110106194950.000|20110106194952.000|TR0|share your thoughts on this. Let's go over 
20110106194952.000|20110106194955.000|TR0|to my Facebook page, and I can tell you 
20110106194955.000|20110106194957.000|TR0|some of what I've seen in there.

20110106195000.000|20110106195002.000|TR0|An interesting posting from Ann who says, 
20110106195002.000|20110106195004.000|TR0|hang on, I just lost that - Ann, who says 
20110106195004.000|20110106195007.000|TR0|-- "Where does the idea come from that 
20110106195007.000|20110106195009.000|TR0|this is unusual, that we save everyone 
20110106195009.000|20110106195012.000|TR0|possible from everything?  We may be able 
20110106195012.000|20110106195014.000|TR0|to do that someday, but we're nowhere near 
20110106195014.000|20110106195016.000|TR0|that day yet."
20110106195016.000|20110106195019.000|TR0|
20110106195019.000|20110106195021.000|TR0|Jamie says, "If this was a homeless 
20110106195021.000|20110106195023.000|TR0|congressperson, they would have gotten a 
20110106195023.000|20110106195026.000|TR0|liver."  And we've got other comments like 
20110106195026.000|20110106195028.000|TR0|that.

20110106195031.000|20110106195033.000|TR0|We've also got people saying that why 
20110106195033.000|20110106195035.000|TR0|should -- Elizabeth is saying "Why should 
20110106195035.000|20110106195038.000|TR0|taxpayers be funding health care for 
20110106195038.000|20110106195040.000|TR0|everyone?" And the sad part of this, 
20110106195040.000|20110106195043.000|TR0|--Eric says "The sad part of this already 
20110106195043.000|20110106195045.000|TR0|sad story is that many people in Arizona 
20110106195045.000|20110106195047.000|TR0|and around the country are against the 
20110106195047.000|20110106195050.000|TR0|push for health care reform because of the 
20110106195050.000|20110106195052.000|TR0|so-called death panels.  And this was a 
20110106195052.000|20110106195054.000|TR0|death panel in its own right."

20110106195133.000|20110106195135.000|TR0|
20110106195135.000|20110106195137.000|TR0|Gloria, it is official.  We just saw it.  
20110106195137.000|20110106195140.000|TR0|Former commerce secretary William Daley is 
20110106195140.000|20110106195142.000|TR0|the new White House chief of staff.  You 
20110106195142.000|20110106195145.000|TR0|know Daley.  You've encountered him.

20110106195147.000|20110106195149.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110106195149.000|20110106195152.000|TR0|ANALYS:   I do.  You know, he's been 
20110106195152.000|20110106195154.000|TR0|around a while in Washington.  So have I.  
20110106195154.000|20110106195156.000|TR0|I've covered him both as commerce 
20110106195156.000|20110106195159.000|TR0|secretary when I covered the fact that he 
20110106195159.000|20110106195201.000|TR0|worked to pass NAFTA, which, as you know, 
20110106195201.000|20110106195204.000|TR0|was an important trade agreement in which 
20110106195204.000|20110106195206.000|TR0|he worked with Democrats and Republicans.
20110106195206.000|20110106195208.000|TR0|
20110106195208.000|20110106195211.000|TR0|I also covered him, Ali, when he ran Al 
20110106195211.000|20110106195213.000|TR0|Gore's campaign.  You remember that.  And 
20110106195213.000|20110106195215.000|TR0|I had this funny story with -- with Bill 
20110106195215.000|20110106195218.000|TR0|Daley.  I was working for CBS at the time, 
20110106195218.000|20110106195220.000|TR0|and it was election night.  As you 
20110106195220.000|20110106195223.000|TR0|remember, we were all going back and forth 
20110106195223.000|20110106195225.000|TR0|on Florida, Florida, Florida.  And I got a 
20110106195225.000|20110106195227.000|TR0|call on my cell phone at some point late, 
20110106195227.000|20110106195230.000|TR0|late in the evening in which it was Bill 
20110106195230.000|20110106195232.000|TR0|Daley who called me up and said, "Gloria, 
20110106195232.000|20110106195235.000|TR0|tell your network we're not conceding.  
20110106195235.000|20110106195237.000|TR0|This election is not over."  And then he 
20110106195237.000|20110106195239.000|TR0|hung up.  And that was it.  And we -- at 
20110106195239.000|20110106195242.000|TR0|that point, I knew, like, okay.  This is 
20110106195242.000|20110106195244.000|TR0|going to take a while.  This is going to 
20110106195244.000|20110106195246.000|TR0|take a while.
20110106195246.000|20110106195249.000|TR0|
20110106195249.000|20110106195251.000|TR0|So he's a real fighter, Bill Daley.  And I 
20110106195251.000|20110106195254.000|TR0|also think it shows you, Ali, that really 
20110106195254.000|20110106195256.000|TR0|the president has made a turn in choosing 
20110106195256.000|20110106195258.000|TR0|Bill Daley to the 2012 election.  Because 
20110106195258.000|20110106195301.000|TR0|in Daley, he not only has somebody who 
20110106195301.000|20110106195303.000|TR0|knows how to work with Republicans, but 
20110106195303.000|20110106195306.000|TR0|this is somebody who understands 
20110106195306.000|20110106195308.000|TR0|presidential campaigns and understands the 
20110106195308.000|20110106195310.000|TR0|importance of getting those independent 
20110106195310.000|20110106195313.000|TR0|voters on to the Democratic side.  Which 
20110106195313.000|20110106195315.000|TR0|is exactly what he's going to try to do 
20110106195315.000|20110106195317.000|TR0|starting today for Barack Obama.  Because 
20110106195317.000|20110106195320.000|TR0|the president, as you know, has lost those 
20110106195320.000|20110106195322.000|TR0|-- those independent voters, those 
20110106195322.000|20110106195325.000|TR0|blue-collar voters that he needs to get 
20110106195325.000|20110106195327.000|TR0|back.
20110106195327.000|20110106195329.000|TR0|
20110106195329.000|20110106195332.000|TR0|VELSHI:  What about all those people that 
20110106195332.000|20110106195334.000|TR0|say -- there are two ways of interpreting 
20110106195334.000|20110106195337.000|TR0|this.  One is that he's cozying up with 
20110106195337.000|20110106195339.000|TR0|business by having a guy who's cozy with 
20110106195339.000|20110106195341.000|TR0|business who's had a senior position at JP 
20110106195341.000|20110106195344.000|TR0|Morgan Chase, or others who say he's 
20110106195344.000|20110106195346.000|TR0|offering an olive branch to business?  
20110106195346.000|20110106195348.000|TR0|Which one of those is true?
20110106195348.000|20110106195351.000|TR0|
20110106195351.000|20110106195353.000|TR0|BORGER:  I think it's probably the olive 
20110106195353.000|20110106195356.000|TR0|branch.  Look, there is no secret -- you 
20110106195356.000|20110106195358.000|TR0|know this better than I do, Ali.  In the 
20110106195358.000|20110106195400.000|TR0|business community, that they need to 
20110106195400.000|20110106195403.000|TR0|start talking to the business community a 
20110106195403.000|20110106195405.000|TR0|little bit more.  And Bill Daley has made 
20110106195405.000|20110106195407.000|TR0|no secret of the fact that he's part of 
20110106195407.000|20110106195410.000|TR0|that business community.  One problem they 
20110106195410.000|20110106195412.000|TR0|might have, quite frankly, is that Daley 
20110106195412.000|20110106195415.000|TR0|was not somebody who supported all of the 
20110106195415.000|20110106195417.000|TR0|financial reform bill, which the president 
20110106195417.000|20110106195419.000|TR0|counts as one of his greatest 
20110106195419.000|20110106195422.000|TR0|achievements, right?
20110106195422.000|20110106195424.000|TR0|
20110106195424.000|20110106195427.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Yep.
20110106195427.000|20110106195429.000|TR0|
20110106195429.000|20110106195431.000|TR0|BORGER:  So that could be a problem.  But 
20110106195431.000|20110106195434.000|TR0|I'll tell you, what's interesting is, 
20110106195434.000|20110106195436.000|TR0|while you do hear from some liberal groups 
20110106195436.000|20110106195438.000|TR0|about Bill Daley not being a good choice, 
20110106195438.000|20110106195441.000|TR0|Howard Dean of all people came out and 
20110106195441.000|20110106195443.000|TR0|said, you know what?  I may disagree with 
20110106195443.000|20110106195446.000|TR0|Bill Daley on a lot of policy issues, but 
20110106195446.000|20110106195448.000|TR0|he's a grown-up and that's what they need 
20110106195448.000|20110106195450.000|TR0|in the White House.  There you go.      
20110106195450.000|20110106195453.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right.  Well, we'll watch it 
20110106195453.000|20110106195455.000|TR0|all unfold.  Gloria, thank you very much.

20110106195529.000|20110106195531.000|TR0|phone):  Hi, Ali.  I agree what Fran 
20110106195531.000|20110106195533.000|TR0|Townsend and Jeanne Meserve have already 
20110106195533.000|20110106195536.000|TR0|reported. It's very early in the 
20110106195536.000|20110106195538.000|TR0|investigation to determine what type of 
20110106195538.000|20110106195540.000|TR0|attack or who might have been behind it.  
20110106195540.000|20110106195543.000|TR0|Obviously no one has claimed credit yet 
20110106195543.000|20110106195545.000|TR0|that we know of.  And at this point, it 
20110106195545.000|20110106195548.000|TR0|will be the forensic work to determine how 
20110106195548.000|20110106195550.000|TR0|the bomb was put together, if it was an 
20110106195550.000|20110106195552.000|TR0|actual bomb that didn't work or was it an 
20110106195552.000|20110106195555.000|TR0|incendiary-type device that someone 
20110106195555.000|20110106195557.000|TR0|concocted at home and tried to detonate to 
20110106195557.000|20110106195559.000|TR0|cause an incident.
20110106195559.000|20110106195602.000|TR0|
20110106195602.000|20110106195604.000|TR0|We don't know that yet.  Time will tell 
20110106195604.000|20110106195607.000|TR0|with that type of thing. We have the 
20110106195607.000|20110106195609.000|TR0|Maryland state police investigating.  Of 
20110106195609.000|20110106195611.000|TR0|course, other federal agencies such as the 
20110106195611.000|20110106195614.000|TR0|FBI and ATF.
20110106195614.000|20110106195616.000|TR0|
20110106195616.000|20110106195619.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110106195619.000|20110106195621.000|TR0|
20110106195621.000|20110106195623.000|TR0|FUENTES:  Providing assistance to 
20110106195623.000|20110106195626.000|TR0|determine the nature of the device and 
20110106195626.000|20110106195628.000|TR0|whether or not a terrorist group, a 
20110106195628.000|20110106195630.000|TR0|domestic terrorist group, might have been 
20110106195630.000|20110106195633.000|TR0|behind it or just somebody that had a 
20110106195633.000|20110106195635.000|TR0|gripe with the state of Maryland or 
20110106195635.000|20110106195638.000|TR0|somebody in one of those offices wanting 
20110106195638.000|20110106195640.000|TR0|to do this incident.
20110106195640.000|20110106195642.000|TR0|
20110106195642.000|20110106195645.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Yes, usually when you see 
20110106195645.000|20110106195647.000|TR0|something in a state government office or 
20110106195647.000|20110106195650.000|TR0|a municipal office, your mind immediately 
20110106195650.000|20110106195652.000|TR0|goes to whether somebody had a gripe or a 
20110106195652.000|20110106195654.000|TR0|former employee or something.  But this 
20110106195654.000|20110106195657.000|TR0|one was in two different places.
20110106195657.000|20110106195659.000|TR0|
20110106195659.000|20110106195701.000|TR0|FUENTES:  Well, that's true.  It may be, 
20110106195701.000|20110106195704.000|TR0|you know, again, to get attention.  It 
20110106195704.000|20110106195706.000|TR0|could be somebody that has -- that doesn't 
20110106195706.000|20110106195709.000|TR0|have a gripe, that just thought this would 
20110106195709.000|20110106195711.000|TR0|be a convenient way -- those offices might 
20110106195711.000|20110106195713.000|TR0|not have had the level of security that a 
20110106195713.000|20110106195716.000|TR0|federal building might have or some other 
20110106195716.000|20110106195718.000|TR0|targets might have had.  So, we don't know 
20110106195718.000|20110106195721.000|TR0|yet exactly the motive or the reason -- 
20110106195721.000|20110106195723.000|TR0|you know, the reason someone would want to 
20110106195723.000|20110106195725.000|TR0|pick those buildings.  That will come out 
20110106195725.000|20110106195728.000|TR0|in time hopefully during the investigation.
20110106195728.000|20110106195730.000|TR0|
20110106195730.000|20110106195732.000|TR0|VELSHI:  One of the building, of course, 
20110106195732.000|20110106195735.000|TR0|was in Annapolis. You're looking at that 
20110106195735.000|20110106195737.000|TR0|right now.  That's the state house.  The 
20110106195737.000|20110106195740.000|TR0|other -- the big installation in Annapolis 
20110106195740.000|20110106195742.000|TR0|is the U.S. Naval Academy. Barbara Starr 
20110106195742.000|20110106195744.000|TR0|is reporting to us from the Pentagon that 
20110106195744.000|20110106195747.000|TR0|Naval Academy officials are aware of the 
20110106195747.000|20110106195749.000|TR0|situation and are taking prudent 
20110106195749.000|20110106195751.000|TR0|precautions.
20110106195751.000|20110106195754.000|TR0|
20110106195754.000|20110106195756.000|TR0|I imagine everybody is checking their mail 
20110106195756.000|20110106195759.000|TR0|right now, Tom.  This is something that 
20110106195759.000|20110106195801.000|TR0|worldwide we've been faced with.  Things 
20110106195801.000|20110106195803.000|TR0|that happen in mailrooms, they're hard to 
20110106195803.000|20110106195806.000|TR0|deal with.  They're hard to foresee.  I 
20110106195806.000|20110106195808.000|TR0|mean, does that sort of change the way we 
20110106195808.000|20110106195811.000|TR0|all look at mail whenever we are?
20110106195811.000|20110106195813.000|TR0|
20110106195813.000|20110106195815.000|TR0|FUENTES: Well, that's the problem.  When 
20110106195815.000|20110106195818.000|TR0|you have an incident that's at a typical 
20110106195818.000|20110106195820.000|TR0|choke point, which might be where mail 
20110106195820.000|20110106195822.000|TR0|comes in or the entrances to buildings, 
20110106195822.000|20110106195825.000|TR0|such as the attack at the Pentagon last 
20110106195825.000|20110106195827.000|TR0|year where it was right at the -- in front 
20110106195827.000|20110106195830.000|TR0|of the checkpoint, that's what those 
20110106195830.000|20110106195832.000|TR0|checkpoints are designed to do.  That's 
20110106195832.000|20110106195834.000|TR0|what mailrooms are designed to do, is 
20110106195834.000|20110106195837.000|TR0|prevent something harmful from going any 
20110106195837.000|20110106195839.000|TR0|further in the system to going to its 
20110106195839.000|20110106195842.000|TR0|final destination.  Unfortunately, that 
20110106195842.000|20110106195844.000|TR0|has to be the first place where packages 
20110106195844.000|20110106195846.000|TR0|are checked.
20110106195846.000|20110106195849.000|TR0|
20110106195849.000|20110106195851.000|TR0|We've seen the bombings in Rome, for 
20110106195851.000|20110106195853.000|TR0|instance, in the last couple of weeks 
20110106195853.000|20110106195856.000|TR0|where these people that were injured in 
20110106195856.000|20110106195858.000|TR0|those attacks were the people that 
20110106195858.000|20110106195901.000|TR0|received the devices in the mail and had 
20110106195901.000|20110106195903.000|TR0|to be responsible for trying to open them 
20110106195903.000|20110106195905.000|TR0|and decide who should get them. So, 
20110106195905.000|20110106195908.000|TR0|anytime you have a mail screening center 
20110106195908.000|20110106195910.000|TR0|or a mail receiving center, that's what's 
20110106195910.000|20110106195913.000|TR0|going to happen.
20110106195913.000|20110106195915.000|TR0|
20110106195915.000|20110106195917.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right.  Tom, very good.  
20110106195917.000|20110106195920.000|TR0|Thank you for helping us out with this,

20110106195924.000|20110106195927.000|TR0|director.
20110106195927.000|20110106195929.000|TR0|
20110106195929.000|20110106195932.000|TR0|That's it for me.  Brooke is going to 
20110106195932.000|20110106195934.000|TR0|continue this live coverage in just a 
20110106195934.000|20110106195936.000|TR0|minute.
