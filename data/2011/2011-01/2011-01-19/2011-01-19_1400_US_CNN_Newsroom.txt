20110119140007.000|20110119140010.000|TR0|FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR:  All 
20110119140010.000|20110119140013.000|TR0|right.  Good morning to both of you.
20110119140013.000|20110119140016.000|TR0|
20110119140016.000|20110119140019.000|TR0|We got a lot going on, beginning with, of 
20110119140019.000|20110119140022.000|TR0|course, these live pictures right now in 
20110119140022.000|20110119140025.000|TR0|preparation for the state visit of 
20110119140025.000|20110119140028.000|TR0|President Hu Jintao of China.  You see 
20110119140028.000|20110119140031.000|TR0|everyone poised there.
20110119140031.000|20110119140034.000|TR0|
20110119140034.000|20110119140037.000|TR0|Of course, later on today, President Obama 
20110119140037.000|20110119140040.000|TR0|and the Chinese president will be getting 
20110119140040.000|20110119140043.000|TR0|down to business.  Right now, of course, 
20110119140043.000|20110119140046.000|TR0|they are about to greet the visiting 
20110119140046.000|20110119140049.000|TR0|leader.  This is a first of this magnitude 
20110119140049.000|20110119140052.000|TR0|in at least about 12 years or so.  And, of 
20110119140052.000|20110119140055.000|TR0|course, we will take you there live to the 
20110119140055.000|20110119140058.000|TR0|garden as it happens.
20110119140058.000|20110119140101.000|TR0|
20110119140101.000|20110119140104.000|TR0|You can see, of course, a number of people 
20110119140104.000|20110119140108.000|TR0|there who have gathered. Those who were 
20110119140108.000|20110119140111.000|TR0|lucky enough to get this bird's eye view 
20110119140111.000|20110119140114.000|TR0|of it.  We understand that some of the 
20110119140114.000|20110119140117.000|TR0|dignitaries, including U.S. Secretary of 
20110119140117.000|20110119140120.000|TR0|State Hillary Clinton, are already there, 
20110119140120.000|20110119140123.000|TR0|as well, poised to do this welcoming of 
20110119140123.000|20110119140126.000|TR0|President Hu, who will be arriving 
20110119140126.000|20110119140129.000|TR0|momentarily.
20110119140129.000|20110119140132.000|TR0|
20110119140132.000|20110119140135.000|TR0|We know that there was a kind of candid 
20110119140135.000|20110119140138.000|TR0|dinner that took place last night between 
20110119140138.000|20110119140141.000|TR0|President Obama and President Hu.  Among 
20110119140141.000|20110119140144.000|TR0|the guests at that dinner, which we 
20110119140144.000|20110119140147.000|TR0|understand to be a much more candor 
20110119140147.000|20110119140150.000|TR0|environment, Secretary of State Hillary 
20110119140150.000|20110119140153.000|TR0|Clinton was there.  No note-takers 
20110119140153.000|20110119140156.000|TR0|apparently.  That might be saved for this 
20110119140156.000|20110119140159.000|TR0|evening when there will be a state dinner 
20110119140159.000|20110119140202.000|TR0|of greater magnitude, of course.
20110119140202.000|20110119140205.000|TR0|
20110119140205.000|20110119140209.000|TR0|All right.  A look at our top stories.  
20110119140209.000|20110119140212.000|TR0|We'll get back to the White House 
20110119140212.000|20110119140215.000|TR0|momentarily.
20110119140215.000|20110119140218.000|TR0|
20110119140218.000|20110119140221.000|TR0|Check out this -- a remarkable video out 
20110119140221.000|20110119140224.000|TR0|of Philadelphia.  Local station WCAU 
20110119140224.000|20110119140227.000|TR0|capturing this raging fireball.  A gas 
20110119140227.000|20110119140230.000|TR0|main exploded, killing one utility worker 
20110119140230.000|20110119140233.000|TR0|and injuring five other people.
20110119140233.000|20110119140236.000|TR0|
20110119140236.000|20110119140239.000|TR0|In Haiti, charges are filed against the 
20110119140239.000|20110119140242.000|TR0|exile dictator who returned home over the 
20110119140242.000|20110119140245.000|TR0|weekend.  John Claude Duvalier, also known 
20110119140245.000|20110119140248.000|TR0|as Baby Doc, fled the country 25 years ago 
20110119140248.000|20110119140251.000|TR0|and has not revealed why he is back.  A 
20110119140251.000|20110119140254.000|TR0|source in the courts -- in that country, 
20110119140254.000|20110119140257.000|TR0|rather, says the charges are related to 
20110119140257.000|20110119140300.000|TR0|financial corruption and may include human 
20110119140300.000|20110119140303.000|TR0|rights violations.
20110119140303.000|20110119140307.000|TR0|
20110119140307.000|20110119140310.000|TR0|And on to Colorado, a mother is charged in 
20110119140310.000|20110119140313.000|TR0|her child's death.  Police say 34-year-old 
20110119140313.000|20110119140316.000|TR0|Shannon Johnson was on Facebook and left 
20110119140316.000|20110119140319.000|TR0|her son unattended in the bathtub.  The 
20110119140319.000|20110119140322.000|TR0|13-month-old infant drowned.
20110119140322.000|20110119140325.000|TR0|
20110119140325.000|20110119140328.000|TR0|America and China, it's among the most 
20110119140328.000|20110119140331.000|TR0|important relationship that we have with a 
20110119140331.000|20110119140334.000|TR0|foreign nation, a rising superpower.  And, 
20110119140334.000|20110119140337.000|TR0|today, President Obama and Chinese 
20110119140337.000|20110119140340.000|TR0|President Hu Jintao get down to business.
20110119140340.000|20110119140343.000|TR0|
20110119140343.000|20110119140346.000|TR0|Right now, the White House is welcoming 
20110119140346.000|20110119140349.000|TR0|the visiting leader ahead of bilateral 
20110119140349.000|20110119140352.000|TR0|talks set for the next hour.  It's the 
20110119140352.000|20110119140355.000|TR0|first of several meetings on this calendar 
20110119140355.000|20110119140358.000|TR0|for today, and President Obama and Hu will 
20110119140358.000|20110119140401.000|TR0|hold a joint news conference later on this 
20110119140401.000|20110119140404.000|TR0|afternoon.
20110119140404.000|20110119140408.000|TR0|
20110119140408.000|20110119140411.000|TR0|You can hear in the background some of the 
20110119140411.000|20110119140414.000|TR0|music there and the pomp and circumstance. 
20110119140414.000|20110119140417.000|TR0| That will be unfolding today during this 
20110119140417.000|20110119140420.000|TR0|state visit of the Chinese president.
20110119140420.000|20110119140423.000|TR0|
20110119140423.000|20110119140426.000|TR0|All right.  The goal: to find some common 
20110119140426.000|20110119140429.000|TR0|ground and strive for common goals, but 
20110119140429.000|20110119140432.000|TR0|it's implicated.  There are tough 
20110119140432.000|20110119140435.000|TR0|conversations ahead on topics that could 
20110119140435.000|20110119140438.000|TR0|affect all of us.  Issue number one: 
20110119140438.000|20110119140441.000|TR0|money.  China is our biggest lender.  But 
20110119140441.000|20110119140444.000|TR0|beyond that, the U.S. has accused China of 
20110119140444.000|20110119140447.000|TR0|manipulating its money, keeping the Yuan 
20110119140447.000|20110119140450.000|TR0|low in order to give products with that 
20110119140450.000|20110119140453.000|TR0|"made in China" label an edge.
20110119140453.000|20110119140456.000|TR0|
20110119140456.000|20110119140459.000|TR0|Then there's the issue of jobs.  The U.S. 
20110119140459.000|20110119140502.000|TR0|ships a lot of stuff to China.  They are 
20110119140502.000|20110119140506.000|TR0|our third biggest buyer and shipping more 
20110119140506.000|20110119140509.000|TR0|products overseas means more work here at 
20110119140509.000|20110119140512.000|TR0|home.
20110119140512.000|20110119140515.000|TR0|
20110119140515.000|20110119140518.000|TR0|And don't forget about China's growing 
20110119140518.000|20110119140521.000|TR0|military.  Sometimes, President Hu seems 
20110119140521.000|20110119140524.000|TR0|to be out of the loop.  He is a civilian 
20110119140524.000|20110119140527.000|TR0|leading the military.  Well, China tested 
20110119140527.000|20110119140530.000|TR0|a new stealth fighter last week and Hu 
20110119140530.000|20110119140533.000|TR0|looked like he didn't know anything about 
20110119140533.000|20110119140536.000|TR0|it.
20110119140536.000|20110119140539.000|TR0|
20110119140539.000|20110119140542.000|TR0|So, there's a lot of ground to cover and 
20110119140542.000|20110119140545.000|TR0|the White House is rolling out the red 
20110119140545.000|20110119140548.000|TR0|carpet.  You see it there literally.
20110119140548.000|20110119140551.000|TR0|
20110119140551.000|20110119140554.000|TR0|Senior White House correspondent Ed Henry 
20110119140554.000|20110119140557.000|TR0|is also joining us live right now.
20110119140557.000|20110119140600.000|TR0|
20110119140600.000|20110119140603.000|TR0|As they get poised and ready for the 
20110119140603.000|20110119140607.000|TR0|arrival of President Hu, there is a lot at 
20110119140607.000|20110119140610.000|TR0|stake.  But perhaps the president, 
20110119140610.000|20110119140613.000|TR0|President Obama, is really setting the 
20110119140613.000|20110119140616.000|TR0|stage here, trying to at least, I guess, 
20110119140616.000|20110119140619.000|TR0|beef up the confidence of President Hu by 
20110119140619.000|20110119140622.000|TR0|having this official state visit, 
20110119140622.000|20110119140625.000|TR0|something he wasn't able to get during 
20110119140625.000|20110119140628.000|TR0|prior visits with an American president.
20110119140628.000|20110119140631.000|TR0|
20110119140631.000|20110119140634.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110119140634.000|20110119140637.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  I was 
20110119140637.000|20110119140640.000|TR0|hearing President Hu visited President 
20110119140640.000|20110119140643.000|TR0|Bush.  He did not have the red carpet sort 
20110119140643.000|20110119140646.000|TR0|of rolled out in the same way.  It's an 
20110119140646.000|20110119140649.000|TR0|important distinction.
20110119140649.000|20110119140652.000|TR0|
20110119140652.000|20110119140655.000|TR0|It's clear that this administration is 
20110119140655.000|20110119140658.000|TR0|trying to point out, not just to the 
20110119140658.000|20110119140701.000|TR0|Chinese, but to the world, that the United 
20110119140701.000|20110119140705.000|TR0|States relationship with China is among 
20110119140705.000|20110119140708.000|TR0|its most important -- perhaps its most 
20110119140708.000|20110119140711.000|TR0|important of all.
20110119140711.000|20110119140714.000|TR0|
20110119140714.000|20110119140717.000|TR0|And it's not just the economy, as you've 
20110119140717.000|20110119140720.000|TR0|been talking about, but security as well.  
20110119140720.000|20110119140723.000|TR0|Let's not forget in recent weeks, there 
20110119140723.000|20110119140726.000|TR0|has been tensions in the Korean Peninsula. 
20110119140726.000|20110119140729.000|TR0| North Korea is such a secretive regime.  
20110119140729.000|20110119140732.000|TR0|And China is one of our only real links to 
20110119140732.000|20110119140735.000|TR0|North Korea because of the trade and the 
20110119140735.000|20110119140738.000|TR0|economic ties China has to North Korea. 
20110119140738.000|20110119140741.000|TR0|And so, that's important and that's why 
20110119140741.000|20110119140744.000|TR0|President Obama, you mentioned that 
20110119140744.000|20110119140747.000|TR0|intimate dinner he had last night with 
20110119140747.000|20110119140750.000|TR0|President Hu, with Secretary of State 
20110119140750.000|20110119140753.000|TR0|Clinton as well, his national security 
20110119140753.000|20110119140756.000|TR0|adviser there, to talk about the security 
20110119140756.000|20110119140759.000|TR0|issues.
20110119140759.000|20110119140802.000|TR0|
20110119140802.000|20110119140806.000|TR0|But the economy and trade are huge as 
20110119140806.000|20110119140809.000|TR0|well.  And you see President Obama walking 
20110119140809.000|20110119140812.000|TR0|out right now.  Let's take a listen.
20110119140812.000|20110119140815.000|TR0|
20110119140815.000|20110119140818.000|TR0|(BAND PLAYING)
20110119140818.000|20110119140821.000|TR0|
20110119140821.000|20110119140824.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  Senior White House 
20110119140824.000|20110119140827.000|TR0|correspondent Ed Henry is still with us.  
20110119140827.000|20110119140830.000|TR0|We also have our business correspondent, 
20110119140830.000|20110119140833.000|TR0|Christine Romans, joining us as well out 
20110119140833.000|20110119140836.000|TR0|of New York.
20110119140836.000|20110119140839.000|TR0|
20110119140839.000|20110119140842.000|TR0|So, Ed, back to you, though, first.  You 
20110119140842.000|20110119140845.000|TR0|know, we talk about the importance of the 
20110119140845.000|20110119140848.000|TR0|president hosting the Chinese President Hu 
20110119140848.000|20110119140851.000|TR0|Jintao. They are going to be talking about 
20110119140851.000|20110119140854.000|TR0|a number of things.  Security, as you 
20110119140854.000|20110119140857.000|TR0|mentioned, jobs, the economy, the Chinese 
20110119140857.000|20110119140900.000|TR0|currency.
20110119140900.000|20110119140903.000|TR0|
20110119140903.000|20110119140907.000|TR0|Is this a visit that really promises to 
20110119140907.000|20110119140910.000|TR0|promote and secure some change, or is this 
20110119140910.000|20110119140913.000|TR0|dialogue to try to reset a tone with China 
20110119140913.000|20110119140916.000|TR0|for something later?
20110119140916.000|20110119140919.000|TR0|
20110119140919.000|20110119140922.000|TR0|HENRY:  It's a great question and I really 
20110119140922.000|20110119140925.000|TR0|think it's the latter. It's setting a 
20110119140925.000|20110119140928.000|TR0|tone.  That's what senior U.S. officials 
20110119140928.000|20110119140931.000|TR0|say that this is an important dialogue.
20110119140931.000|20110119140934.000|TR0|
20110119140934.000|20110119140937.000|TR0|We should point out that their dinner last 
20110119140937.000|20110119140940.000|TR0|night was the eighth time that -- since 
20110119140940.000|20110119140943.000|TR0|President Obama took office, that he's had 
20110119140943.000|20110119140946.000|TR0|one-on-one talks with the Chinese 
20110119140946.000|20110119140949.000|TR0|president.  That is a huge number, 
20110119140949.000|20110119140952.000|TR0|obviously, in two years.  It gives you an 
20110119140952.000|20110119140955.000|TR0|idea of how much care they are taking with 
20110119140955.000|20110119140958.000|TR0|this relationship.
20110119140958.000|20110119141001.000|TR0|
20110119141001.000|20110119141005.000|TR0|And what senior U.S. officials say is, 
20110119141005.000|20110119141008.000|TR0|look, we're not expecting some major 
20110119141008.000|20110119141011.000|TR0|breakthrough.  We're not expecting 
20110119141011.000|20110119141014.000|TR0|something to be a game- changer here, but 
20110119141014.000|20110119141017.000|TR0|they say that, in private, President Obama 
20110119141017.000|20110119141020.000|TR0|is planning to be direct and tough with 
20110119141020.000|20110119141023.000|TR0|President Hu.  In public, he is, of 
20110119141023.000|20110119141026.000|TR0|course, going to be less direct and trying 
20110119141026.000|20110119141029.000|TR0|to highlight where they agree instead of 
20110119141029.000|20110119141032.000|TR0|talking about the disagreements on trade, 
20110119141032.000|20110119141035.000|TR0|on currency, on human rights as well, 
20110119141035.000|20110119141038.000|TR0|which we should note in addition to the 
20110119141038.000|20110119141041.000|TR0|other important economic and security 
20110119141041.000|20110119141044.000|TR0|issues.
20110119141044.000|20110119141047.000|TR0|
20110119141047.000|20110119141050.000|TR0|And so, I think it is really more about a 
20110119141050.000|20110119141053.000|TR0|dialogue.  We should not expect that when 
20110119141053.000|20110119141056.000|TR0|this is done, that there's going to be 
20110119141056.000|20110119141059.000|TR0|some grand strategic framework that's 
20110119141059.000|20110119141102.000|TR0|going to change the relationship for the 
20110119141102.000|20110119141106.000|TR0|next decade.  But I do think this 
20110119141106.000|20110119141109.000|TR0|administration realizes that China is 
20110119141109.000|20110119141112.000|TR0|going to be one of our most important 
20110119141112.000|20110119141115.000|TR0|allies, potentially beyond this 
20110119141115.000|20110119141118.000|TR0|administration, and that they are building 
20110119141118.000|20110119141121.000|TR0|that relationship that's probably going to 
20110119141121.000|20110119141124.000|TR0|go well, well beyond this administration, 
20110119141124.000|20110119141127.000|TR0|Fred.
20110119141127.000|20110119141130.000|TR0|
20110119141130.000|20110119141133.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  So, President Hu Jintao now 
20110119141133.000|20110119141136.000|TR0|arriving, being escorted by the president 
20110119141136.000|20110119141139.000|TR0|and Michelle Obama.
20110119141139.000|20110119141142.000|TR0|
20110119141142.000|20110119141145.000|TR0|So, Christine Romans now in New York -- 
20110119141145.000|20110119141148.000|TR0|give me an idea of perhaps the parameters 
20110119141148.000|20110119141151.000|TR0|for the president.  While he may be 
20110119141151.000|20110119141154.000|TR0|talking about human rights, he can only be 
20110119141154.000|20110119141157.000|TR0|so forceful on the issue of human rights 
20110119141157.000|20110119141200.000|TR0|because might that undermine the efforts 
20110119141200.000|20110119141204.000|TR0|when talking about economic issues. 
20110119141204.000|20110119141207.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS 
20110119141207.000|20110119141210.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  And that's what's so 
20110119141210.000|20110119141213.000|TR0|interesting, Fredricka.  There are so many 
20110119141213.000|20110119141216.000|TR0|difference aspects where the United States 
20110119141216.000|20110119141219.000|TR0|and China are both partners and 
20110119141219.000|20110119141222.000|TR0|adversaries, that you wonder, you can't 
20110119141222.000|20110119141225.000|TR0|push too hard on one part of the equation 
20110119141225.000|20110119141228.000|TR0|because you need China to be helping you 
20110119141228.000|20110119141231.000|TR0|with North Korea and Iran, or doing more 
20110119141231.000|20110119141234.000|TR0|with North Korea and Iran.
20110119141234.000|20110119141237.000|TR0|
20110119141237.000|20110119141240.000|TR0|But, at the same time, the United States 
20110119141240.000|20110119141243.000|TR0|is more and more vocal now about concerns 
20110119141243.000|20110119141246.000|TR0|about trade issues, letting U.S. companies 
20110119141246.000|20110119141249.000|TR0|have more access to Chinese markets.  
20110119141249.000|20110119141252.000|TR0|China has "China first" policy for its 
20110119141252.000|20110119141255.000|TR0|markets.  And, in many cases, they are 
20110119141255.000|20110119141258.000|TR0|trying to build national superior entities 
20110119141258.000|20110119141301.000|TR0|for their own industries.
20110119141301.000|20110119141305.000|TR0|
20110119141305.000|20110119141308.000|TR0|And that's something that American CEOs 
20110119141308.000|20110119141311.000|TR0|have been a little bit concerned about.  
20110119141311.000|20110119141314.000|TR0|Even if they are going to China to do 
20110119141314.000|20110119141317.000|TR0|business, they are concerned that the 
20110119141317.000|20110119141320.000|TR0|Chinese will always favor Chinese 
20110119141320.000|20110119141323.000|TR0|companies first, in fact, asking for 
20110119141323.000|20110119141326.000|TR0|American companies to give up intellectual 
20110119141326.000|20110119141329.000|TR0|property to do innovation and investing 
20110119141329.000|20110119141332.000|TR0|within China -- in some ways, competing 
20110119141332.000|20110119141335.000|TR0|ultimately against the United States with 
20110119141335.000|20110119141338.000|TR0|U.S. innovation and technology.
20110119141338.000|20110119141341.000|TR0|
20110119141341.000|20110119141344.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  Christine and Ed, 
20110119141344.000|20110119141347.000|TR0|thanks so much.
20110119141347.000|20110119141350.000|TR0|
20110119141350.000|20110119141353.000|TR0|We will listen in a moment here for the 
20110119141353.000|20110119141356.000|TR0|introduction of the two presidents.

20110119141412.000|20110119141415.000|TR0|Jintao there at the White House, alongside

20110119141418.000|20110119141421.000|TR0|Obama.  We're going to take a short break. 
20110119141421.000|20110119141424.000|TR0| And on the other side, we hope to hear 
20110119141424.000|20110119141427.000|TR0|comments coming from both presidents there

20110119141448.000|20110119141451.000|TR0|Well, you're seeing activity at the South 
20110119141451.000|20110119141454.000|TR0|Lawn of the White House there, President 
20110119141454.000|20110119141457.000|TR0|Obama and President Hu Jintao of China 
20110119141457.000|20110119141500.000|TR0|there being greeted what appeared to be a

20110119141504.000|20110119141507.000|TR0|South Lawn.  This is the opening and

20110119141537.000|20110119141540.000|TR0|get to that part, we hope to hear from the 
20110119141540.000|20110119141543.000|TR0|president momentarily after he goes 
20110119141543.000|20110119141546.000|TR0|through this long line of people who have 
20110119141546.000|20110119141549.000|TR0|come to greet both presidents, here, on 
20110119141549.000|20110119141552.000|TR0|the South Lawn.
20110119141552.000|20110119141555.000|TR0|
20110119141555.000|20110119141558.000|TR0|We'll be hearing from President Obama as 
20110119141558.000|20110119141601.000|TR0|well as President Hu.  And we understand 
20110119141601.000|20110119141605.000|TR0|during this three-day visit of the Chinese 
20110119141605.000|20110119141608.000|TR0|president, they'll be talking about 
20110119141608.000|20110119141611.000|TR0|everything from trade to the Chinese 
20110119141611.000|20110119141614.000|TR0|currency, as well as human rights.
20110119141614.000|20110119141617.000|TR0|
20110119141617.000|20110119141620.000|TR0|But you heard our business correspondent 
20110119141620.000|20110119141623.000|TR0|Christine Romans talk earlier how the US, 
20110119141623.000|20110119141626.000|TR0|while it wants to be quite emphatic about 
20110119141626.000|20110119141629.000|TR0|human rights, it has to strike a delicate 
20110119141629.000|20110119141632.000|TR0|balance because, certainly, don't want the 
20110119141632.000|20110119141635.000|TR0|talk of human rights to undermine their 
20110119141635.000|20110119141638.000|TR0|efforts to try to make some headway as it 
20110119141638.000|20110119141641.000|TR0|pertains to the economy.  China among the 
20110119141641.000|20110119141644.000|TR0|fastest growing economies in the world.
20110119141644.000|20110119141647.000|TR0|
20110119141647.000|20110119141650.000|TR0|You see lots of handshaking, there.  It's 
20110119141650.000|20110119141653.000|TR0|unclear exactly what President Hu will be 
20110119141653.000|20110119141656.000|TR0|saying, but this will be a somewhat rare 
20110119141656.000|20110119141659.000|TR0|occasion because President Hu doesn't make 
20110119141659.000|20110119141703.000|TR0|himself available too often for public 
20110119141703.000|20110119141706.000|TR0|comments and certainly not comments in 
20110119141706.000|20110119141709.000|TR0|front of Western reporters, that certainly 
20110119141709.000|20110119141712.000|TR0|will be taking place momentarily.
20110119141712.000|20110119141715.000|TR0|
20110119141715.000|20110119141718.000|TR0|Our senior White House correspondent, Ed 
20110119141718.000|20110119141721.000|TR0|Henry, is also there.  Ed, let me bring 
20110119141721.000|20110119141724.000|TR0|you back into the equation on the timeline 
20110119141724.000|20110119141727.000|TR0|here.  After going through this very long 
20110119141727.000|20110119141730.000|TR0|line of handshaking, which doesn't always 
20110119141730.000|20110119141733.000|TR0|happen during a state visit, why is this 
20110119141733.000|20110119141736.000|TR0|so important to show this kind of 
20110119141736.000|20110119141739.000|TR0|accessibility of the Chinese president and 
20110119141739.000|20110119141742.000|TR0|the American president?
20110119141742.000|20110119141745.000|TR0|
20110119141745.000|20110119141748.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110119141748.000|20110119141751.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, big time.  You can see 
20110119141751.000|20110119141754.000|TR0|some of the Chinese folks who are there 
20110119141754.000|20110119141757.000|TR0|who are beaming at the chance to shake the 
20110119141757.000|20110119141800.000|TR0|hand of the US President.   And you're 
20110119141800.000|20110119141804.000|TR0|right, for Westerners to get a chance to 
20110119141804.000|20110119141807.000|TR0|get that close to the Chinese president, 
20110119141807.000|20110119141810.000|TR0|this Communist leader, shake his hand, 
20110119141810.000|20110119141813.000|TR0|perhaps just get a glimpse of him, is 
20110119141813.000|20110119141816.000|TR0|extremely rare.
20110119141816.000|20110119141819.000|TR0|
20110119141819.000|20110119141822.000|TR0|You know, to the news conference later 
20110119141822.000|20110119141825.000|TR0|today, just after 1:00 PM Eastern Time, 
20110119141825.000|20110119141828.000|TR0|I've been to many of these kind of join 
20110119141828.000|20110119141831.000|TR0|conferences with the US and Chinese 
20110119141831.000|20110119141834.000|TR0|presidents, both President Bush and 
20110119141834.000|20110119141837.000|TR0|President Obama and, quote/unquote, "news 
20110119141837.000|20110119141840.000|TR0|conferences" usually become just 
20110119141840.000|20110119141843.000|TR0|statements because the Chinese president 
20110119141843.000|20110119141846.000|TR0|is not willing to take questions from the 
20110119141846.000|20110119141849.000|TR0|Western reporters.
20110119141849.000|20110119141852.000|TR0|
20110119141852.000|20110119141855.000|TR0|So, this was a big change that the White 
20110119141855.000|20110119141858.000|TR0|House was able to get, to force that and 
20110119141858.000|20110119141902.000|TR0|say, "Look, there's going to be some 
20110119141902.000|20110119141905.000|TR0|openness here." And, look, there could be 
20110119141905.000|20110119141908.000|TR0|all kinds of different questions the 
20110119141908.000|20110119141911.000|TR0|Chinese president can get as well as the 
20110119141911.000|20110119141914.000|TR0|US president in terms of some pressure on 
20110119141914.000|20110119141917.000|TR0|him from the media in terms of how tough 
20110119141917.000|20110119141920.000|TR0|is he really being in these conversations 
20110119141920.000|20110119141923.000|TR0|behind closed doors and in public with the 
20110119141923.000|20110119141926.000|TR0|Chinese leader on human rights, For 
20110119141926.000|20110119141929.000|TR0|example?
20110119141929.000|20110119141932.000|TR0|
20110119141932.000|20110119141935.000|TR0|I think our colleague John King put it 
20110119141935.000|20110119141938.000|TR0|perfectly last night when he said on his 
20110119141938.000|20110119141941.000|TR0|program that here you have standing 
20110119141941.000|20110119141944.000|TR0|together one president who is a Nobel 
20110119141944.000|20110119141947.000|TR0|Peace Prize winner and another president 
20110119141947.000|20110119141950.000|TR0|who has a Nobel Peace Prize winner in jail 
20110119141950.000|20110119141953.000|TR0|right now.  It's pretty remarkable when 
20110119141953.000|20110119141956.000|TR0|you think about that contrast.
20110119141956.000|20110119141959.000|TR0|
20110119141959.000|20110119142003.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  It is very remarkable.  And 
20110119142003.000|20110119142006.000|TR0|here, this is from -- this is an occasion 
20110119142006.000|20110119142009.000|TR0|that's taking place just days after 
20110119142009.000|20110119142012.000|TR0|President Hu had some interesting words 
20110119142012.000|20110119142015.000|TR0|with "The Washington Post" recently, 
20110119142015.000|20110119142018.000|TR0|saying that it was his intent and he could 
20110119142018.000|20110119142021.000|TR0|see that this trip would mean that China 
20110119142021.000|20110119142024.000|TR0|and the US would, indeed, find common 
20110119142024.000|20110119142027.000|TR0|ground.  And that's something that was 
20110119142027.000|20110119142030.000|TR0|quoted in "The Washington Post" over the 
20110119142030.000|20110119142033.000|TR0|weekend.  So, is this the result of 
20110119142033.000|20110119142036.000|TR0|President Obama, perhaps, being more firm 
20110119142036.000|20110119142039.000|TR0|with China in recent weeks, especially 
20110119142039.000|20110119142042.000|TR0|after this military exercises in North 
20110119142042.000|20110119142045.000|TR0|Korea, which caused some consternation 
20110119142045.000|20110119142048.000|TR0|between the US and China?
20110119142048.000|20110119142051.000|TR0|
20110119142051.000|20110119142054.000|TR0|HENRY:  Well, certainly they have their 
20110119142054.000|20110119142057.000|TR0|differences.  And the White House 
20110119142057.000|20110119142101.000|TR0|certainly wants to highlight areas where 
20110119142101.000|20110119142104.000|TR0|they can agree.  But I have to tell you 
20110119142104.000|20110119142107.000|TR0|that I'm not sure they can claim too much 
20110119142107.000|20110119142110.000|TR0|credit because a lot of that may just be 
20110119142110.000|20110119142113.000|TR0|rhetoric, frankly, because there were 
20110119142113.000|20110119142116.000|TR0|other officials before this visit.
20110119142116.000|20110119142119.000|TR0|
20110119142119.000|20110119142122.000|TR0|There's always talks that both sides have 
20110119142122.000|20110119142125.000|TR0|beforehand to try to forge deals and 
20110119142125.000|20110119142128.000|TR0|whatnot.  And the US economic team that 
20110119142128.000|20110119142131.000|TR0|met with Chinese officials before this, 
20110119142131.000|20110119142134.000|TR0|we're told, came back to the United States 
20110119142134.000|20110119142137.000|TR0|about a week or so ago very disappointed 
20110119142137.000|20110119142140.000|TR0|that they didn't get very far.
20110119142140.000|20110119142143.000|TR0|
20110119142143.000|20110119142146.000|TR0|And so, we're going to certainly see them 
20110119142146.000|20110119142149.000|TR0|in all of this pomp and circumstance, both 
20110119142149.000|20110119142152.000|TR0|leaders highlight where they agree, but 
20110119142152.000|20110119142155.000|TR0|there are still sharp, sharp disagreements 
20110119142155.000|20110119142158.000|TR0|that they have over the way China handles 
20110119142158.000|20110119142202.000|TR0|its currency.  The deep trade imbalances.
20110119142202.000|20110119142205.000|TR0|
20110119142205.000|20110119142208.000|TR0|And we should point out, as Christine 
20110119142208.000|20110119142211.000|TR0|knows better than I, that the Chinese 
20110119142211.000|20110119142214.000|TR0|president will be going to Chicago after 
20110119142214.000|20110119142217.000|TR0|Washington and, in part, he's going to be 
20110119142217.000|20110119142220.000|TR0|visiting an auto parts plant there where 
20110119142220.000|20110119142223.000|TR0|China is investing a significant amount of 
20110119142223.000|20110119142226.000|TR0|money, to try to, in part, obviously -- 
20110119142226.000|20110119142229.000|TR0|let's just say it.  A PR effort to say, 
20110119142229.000|20110119142232.000|TR0|look.  China's investing money here in the 
20110119142232.000|20110119142235.000|TR0|US, and that means US jobs are created.
20110119142235.000|20110119142238.000|TR0|
20110119142238.000|20110119142241.000|TR0|That may be the case, but a lot of 
20110119142241.000|20110119142244.000|TR0|Americans right now, with this stubbornly 
20110119142244.000|20110119142247.000|TR0|high unemployment rate, almost 10 percent, 
20110119142247.000|20110119142250.000|TR0|are seeing a lot of other US jobs being 
20110119142250.000|20110119142253.000|TR0|shipped overseas right now and, obviously, 
20110119142253.000|20110119142256.000|TR0|a lot of people in our audience, very 
20110119142256.000|20110119142259.000|TR0|skeptical that China is really willing to 
20110119142259.000|20110119142303.000|TR0|have a level playing field with the US 
20110119142303.000|20110119142306.000|TR0|that will foster more economic growth 
20110119142306.000|20110119142309.000|TR0|here, more US jobs created.
20110119142309.000|20110119142312.000|TR0|
20110119142312.000|20110119142315.000|TR0|And that's why, in part, these talks will 
20110119142315.000|20110119142318.000|TR0|include meeting early this afternoon 
20110119142318.000|20110119142321.000|TR0|between the two presidents, as well as 
20110119142321.000|20110119142324.000|TR0|business leaders from both countries to 
20110119142324.000|20110119142327.000|TR0|try to hash some of that out, Fred.
20110119142327.000|20110119142330.000|TR0|
20110119142330.000|20110119142333.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Ed Henry, thanks so much.  And 
20110119142333.000|20110119142336.000|TR0|Christine Romans will talk with you 
20110119142336.000|20110119142339.000|TR0|momentarily.  Right now, let's listen to 
20110119142339.000|20110119142342.000|TR0|President Barack Obama.
20110119142342.000|20110119142345.000|TR0|
20110119142345.000|20110119142348.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110119142348.000|20110119142351.000|TR0|STATES:  Members of the Chinese 
20110119142351.000|20110119142354.000|TR0|delegation, on behalf of Michelle and 
20110119142354.000|20110119142357.000|TR0|myself, welcome to the White House.  And 
20110119142357.000|20110119142401.000|TR0|on behalf of the American people, welcome 
20110119142401.000|20110119142404.000|TR0|to the United States.
20110119142404.000|20110119142407.000|TR0|
20110119142407.000|20110119142410.000|TR0|Three decades ago, on a January day like 
20110119142410.000|20110119142413.000|TR0|this, another American president stood 
20110119142413.000|20110119142416.000|TR0|here and welcomed another Chinese leader 
20110119142416.000|20110119142419.000|TR0|for the historic normalization of 
20110119142419.000|20110119142422.000|TR0|relations between the United States and 
20110119142422.000|20110119142425.000|TR0|the People's Republic of China.  On that 
20110119142425.000|20110119142428.000|TR0|day, Deng Xiaoping spoke of the great 
20110119142428.000|20110119142431.000|TR0|possibilities of cooperation between our 
20110119142431.000|20110119142434.000|TR0|two nations.
20110119142434.000|20110119142437.000|TR0|
20110119142437.000|20110119142440.000|TR0|Looking back on that winter day in 1979, 
20110119142440.000|20110119142443.000|TR0|it is now clear the previous 30 years had 
20110119142443.000|20110119142446.000|TR0|been a time of estrangement for our two 
20110119142446.000|20110119142449.000|TR0|countries.  The 30 years since have been a 
20110119142449.000|20110119142452.000|TR0|time of growing exchanges and 
20110119142452.000|20110119142455.000|TR0|understanding.  With this visit, we can 
20110119142455.000|20110119142458.000|TR0|lay the foundation for the next 30 years.
20110119142458.000|20110119142502.000|TR0|
20110119142502.000|20110119142505.000|TR0|At a time when some doubt the benefits of 
20110119142505.000|20110119142508.000|TR0|cooperation between the United States and 
20110119142508.000|20110119142511.000|TR0|China, this visit is also a chance to 
20110119142511.000|20110119142514.000|TR0|demonstrate a simple truth.  We have an 
20110119142514.000|20110119142517.000|TR0|enormous stake in each other's success, in 
20110119142517.000|20110119142520.000|TR0|an interconnected world, in a global 
20110119142520.000|20110119142523.000|TR0|economy.  Nations, including our own, will 
20110119142523.000|20110119142526.000|TR0|be more prosperous and more secure when we 
20110119142526.000|20110119142529.000|TR0|work together.
20110119142529.000|20110119142532.000|TR0|
20110119142532.000|20110119142535.000|TR0|The United States welcomes China's rise as 
20110119142535.000|20110119142538.000|TR0|a strong, prosperous, and successful 
20110119142538.000|20110119142541.000|TR0|member of the community of nations.  
20110119142541.000|20110119142544.000|TR0|Indeed, China's success has brought with 
20110119142544.000|20110119142547.000|TR0|it economic benefits for our people, as 
20110119142547.000|20110119142550.000|TR0|well as yours.  And our cooperation on a 
20110119142550.000|20110119142553.000|TR0|range of issues has helped advanced 
20110119142553.000|20110119142556.000|TR0|stability in the Asia Pacific and in the 
20110119142556.000|20110119142600.000|TR0|world.
20110119142600.000|20110119142603.000|TR0|
20110119142603.000|20110119142606.000|TR0|We also know this.  History shows that 
20110119142606.000|20110119142609.000|TR0|societies are more harmonious, nations are 
20110119142609.000|20110119142612.000|TR0|more successful, and the world is more 
20110119142612.000|20110119142615.000|TR0|just when the rights and responsibilities 
20110119142615.000|20110119142618.000|TR0|of all nations and all people are upheld, 
20110119142618.000|20110119142621.000|TR0|including the universal rights of every 
20110119142621.000|20110119142624.000|TR0|human being.
20110119142624.000|20110119142627.000|TR0|
20110119142627.000|20110119142630.000|TR0|Mr.  President, we can learn from our 
20110119142630.000|20110119142633.000|TR0|people.  Chinese and American students and 
20110119142633.000|20110119142636.000|TR0|educators, business people, tourists, 
20110119142636.000|20110119142639.000|TR0|researchers, and scientists, including 
20110119142639.000|20110119142642.000|TR0|Chinese-Americans who are here today, they 
20110119142642.000|20110119142645.000|TR0|work together and make progress together 
20110119142645.000|20110119142648.000|TR0|every single day.  They know that, even as 
20110119142648.000|20110119142651.000|TR0|our nations compete in some areas, we can 
20110119142651.000|20110119142654.000|TR0|cooperate in so many others, in a spirit 
20110119142654.000|20110119142657.000|TR0|of mutual respect for our mutual benefit.
20110119142657.000|20110119142701.000|TR0|
20110119142701.000|20110119142704.000|TR0|What Deng Xiaoping said long ago remains 
20110119142704.000|20110119142707.000|TR0|true today.  There are still great coop -- 
20110119142707.000|20110119142710.000|TR0|possibilities for cooperation between our 
20110119142710.000|20110119142713.000|TR0|countries. President Hu, members of the 
20110119142713.000|20110119142716.000|TR0|Chinese delegation, let us seize these 
20110119142716.000|20110119142719.000|TR0|possibilities together.  Welcome to the

20110119142731.000|20110119142734.000|TR0|HU JINTAO, PRESIDENT OF CHINA (through

20110119142808.000|20110119142811.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Chinese president Hu Jintao, 
20110119142811.000|20110119142814.000|TR0|here, speaking after President Obama just 
20110119142814.000|20110119142817.000|TR0|talked about this coming at a time, this 
20110119142817.000|20110119142820.000|TR0|meeting between these two nations, at a 
20110119142820.000|20110119142823.000|TR0|time when there has been some doubt about 
20110119142823.000|20110119142826.000|TR0|the cooperation between the US And China.
20110119142826.000|20110119142829.000|TR0|
20110119142829.000|20110119142832.000|TR0|Our business correspondent Christine 
20110119142832.000|20110119142835.000|TR0|Romans is joining us from New York.  Our 
20110119142835.000|20110119142838.000|TR0|senior White House correspondent Ed Henry 
20110119142838.000|20110119142841.000|TR0|is there at the White House as this is all 
20110119142841.000|20110119142844.000|TR0|taking place, here, on the South Lawn.
20110119142844.000|20110119142847.000|TR0|
20110119142847.000|20110119142850.000|TR0|Christine, let me begin with you, because 
20110119142850.000|20110119142853.000|TR0|we're talking about the cooperation 
20110119142853.000|20110119142856.000|TR0|between these two nations that it will 
20110119142856.000|20110119142900.000|TR0|take to restore the economic road that 
20110119142900.000|20110119142903.000|TR0|both countries would be able to enjoy some 
20110119142903.000|20110119142906.000|TR0|prosperity.  Why is this particularly 
20110119142906.000|20110119142909.000|TR0|important, these two countries, these two 
20110119142909.000|20110119142912.000|TR0|presidents, coming together at this state 
20110119142912.000|20110119142915.000|TR0|visit, especially when President Hu will 
20110119142915.000|20110119142918.000|TR0|be handing over power in just a couple 
20110119142918.000|20110119142921.000|TR0|years?
20110119142921.000|20110119142924.000|TR0|
20110119142924.000|20110119142927.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS 
20110119142927.000|20110119142930.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, here is what's so 
20110119142930.000|20110119142933.000|TR0|important about it, I guess, for the 
20110119142933.000|20110119142936.000|TR0|American middle class.  Because for so 
20110119142936.000|20110119142939.000|TR0|long, we've enjoyed low interest rates 
20110119142939.000|20110119142942.000|TR0|because we've had willing foreign -- 
20110119142942.000|20110119142945.000|TR0|foreign creditors.  China's a big investor 
20110119142945.000|20110119142948.000|TR0|in the United States, that's helped keep 
20110119142948.000|20110119142951.000|TR0|our interest rates low, and that's been 
20110119142951.000|20110119142954.000|TR0|something that the American class enjoyed.
20110119142954.000|20110119142957.000|TR0|
20110119142957.000|20110119143001.000|TR0|Also, we borrow money from China to buy 
20110119143001.000|20110119143004.000|TR0|things, consumer products more cheaply 
20110119143004.000|20110119143007.000|TR0|than we otherwise would have.  So, the 
20110119143007.000|20110119143010.000|TR0|US/China relationship is something you 
20110119143010.000|20110119143013.000|TR0|feel every time you get in your car, every 
20110119143013.000|20110119143016.000|TR0|time you open up the cupboard in your 
20110119143016.000|20110119143019.000|TR0|kitchen, every time you go to the mall or 
20110119143019.000|20110119143022.000|TR0|to the shopping center.
20110119143022.000|20110119143025.000|TR0|
20110119143025.000|20110119143028.000|TR0|The question is, where does that 
20110119143028.000|20110119143031.000|TR0|relationship go from here?  Because China 
20110119143031.000|20110119143034.000|TR0|has used the open international markets 
20110119143034.000|20110119143037.000|TR0|that the United States has been 
20110119143037.000|20110119143040.000|TR0|championing for some time to build its own 
20110119143040.000|20110119143043.000|TR0|economic powerhouse.
20110119143043.000|20110119143046.000|TR0|
20110119143046.000|20110119143049.000|TR0|But, at the same time, it is also building 
20110119143049.000|20110119143052.000|TR0|its own infrastructure spending a lot of 
20110119143052.000|20110119143055.000|TR0|American dollars -- money that it has made 
20110119143055.000|20110119143059.000|TR0|from investing in the United States -- to 
20110119143059.000|20110119143102.000|TR0|compete and overtake the U.S., eventually 
20110119143102.000|20110119143105.000|TR0|economically.  We don't have the same 
20110119143105.000|20110119143108.000|TR0|world views.  And that's something that 
20110119143108.000|20110119143111.000|TR0|the United States has been the super power 
20110119143111.000|20110119143114.000|TR0|and its world view democracy, freedom and 
20110119143114.000|20110119143117.000|TR0|the like has been the world's view for 
20110119143117.000|20110119143120.000|TR0|some time, open international markets.
20110119143120.000|20110119143123.000|TR0|
20110119143123.000|20110119143126.000|TR0|But the Chinese are rewriting an 
20110119143126.000|20110119143129.000|TR0|international system with their own rules. 
20110119143129.000|20110119143132.000|TR0| And that's something that's unsettling in 
20110119143132.000|20110119143135.000|TR0|Washington.  It's unsettling in Europe, 
20110119143135.000|20110119143138.000|TR0|quite frankly, as well.  So this is why 
20110119143138.000|20110119143141.000|TR0|this relationship is so incredibly 
20110119143141.000|20110119143144.000|TR0|important because if both countries are 
20110119143144.000|20110119143147.000|TR0|going to prosper, they both need each 
20110119143147.000|20110119143150.000|TR0|other.  There have been frictions that 
20110119143150.000|20110119143153.000|TR0|have been bubbling lately, no question 
20110119143153.000|20110119143156.000|TR0|about it.  So it's incredibly important 
20110119143156.000|20110119143200.000|TR0|for these leaders to publicly put those 
20110119143200.000|20110119143203.000|TR0|frictions aside and maybe solve some of 
20110119143203.000|20110119143206.000|TR0|these problems.
20110119143206.000|20110119143209.000|TR0|
20110119143209.000|20110119143212.000|TR0|Bottom line though, Fredricka, and every 
20110119143212.000|20110119143215.000|TR0|China expert will tell you this,   China 
20110119143215.000|20110119143218.000|TR0|only makes decision based on the best 
20110119143218.000|20110119143221.000|TR0|national interests of China.  China has 
20110119143221.000|20110119143224.000|TR0|hundreds of millions of people that it's 
20110119143224.000|20110119143227.000|TR0|trying to pull out of poverty.  Even when 
20110119143227.000|20110119143230.000|TR0|China overtakes the U.S. in its the size 
20110119143230.000|20110119143233.000|TR0|of its economy, its per capita income for 
20110119143233.000|20110119143236.000|TR0|each person, how much money each person 
20110119143236.000|20110119143239.000|TR0|takes home will still be much, much lower 
20110119143239.000|20110119143242.000|TR0|than the United States.  So no matter 
20110119143242.000|20110119143245.000|TR0|what, we're always going to be their big 
20110119143245.000|20110119143248.000|TR0|customer.
20110119143248.000|20110119143251.000|TR0|
20110119143251.000|20110119143254.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Which is why it's confusing to 
20110119143254.000|20110119143258.000|TR0|me as to why that country chooses to keep 
20110119143258.000|20110119143301.000|TR0|its currency low and that is one of the 
20110119143301.000|20110119143304.000|TR0|sticking points for the U.S.  And European 
20110119143304.000|20110119143307.000|TR0|countries also want to have dialogue with 
20110119143307.000|20110119143310.000|TR0|China to stop them from doing that.  Why?
20110119143310.000|20110119143313.000|TR0|
20110119143313.000|20110119143316.000|TR0|ROMANS:  Because it allows their export 
20110119143316.000|20110119143319.000|TR0|machine to keep humming.  It allows them 
20110119143319.000|20110119143322.000|TR0|to employ millions of people in broad, 
20110119143322.000|20110119143325.000|TR0|huge, high-tech campuses, churning out 
20110119143325.000|20110119143328.000|TR0|what used to be low-skilled, low quality 
20110119143328.000|20110119143331.000|TR0|goods like, you know, tennis shoes and 
20110119143331.000|20110119143334.000|TR0|T-shirts.
20110119143334.000|20110119143337.000|TR0|
20110119143337.000|20110119143340.000|TR0|Now it's high tech items like iPhones and 
20110119143340.000|20110119143343.000|TR0|iPads and more and more technology.  
20110119143343.000|20110119143346.000|TR0|Engine parts, maybe even a civilian 
20110119143346.000|20110119143349.000|TR0|aviation industry. There's a big deal 
20110119143349.000|20110119143352.000|TR0|that's been signed on the eve of this trip 
20110119143352.000|20110119143355.000|TR0|between GE.  GE is going to be supplying 
20110119143355.000|20110119143359.000|TR0|some engines to the nascent Chinese 
20110119143359.000|20110119143402.000|TR0|aviation industry.
20110119143402.000|20110119143405.000|TR0|
20110119143405.000|20110119143408.000|TR0|China is -- and also, you know, I think 
20110119143408.000|20110119143411.000|TR0|I've mentioned this before, but China has 
20110119143411.000|20110119143414.000|TR0|a strategy of creating national champions. 
20110119143414.000|20110119143417.000|TR0| So it invites American companies in to do 
20110119143417.000|20110119143420.000|TR0|business with China with the understanding 
20110119143420.000|20110119143423.000|TR0|that those companies are going to have to 
20110119143423.000|20110119143426.000|TR0|share technology, share expertise so that 
20110119143426.000|20110119143429.000|TR0|China can grow its own industries to be 
20110119143429.000|20110119143432.000|TR0|the best in the world.
20110119143432.000|20110119143435.000|TR0|
20110119143435.000|20110119143438.000|TR0|And many of these industries, they have a 
20110119143438.000|20110119143441.000|TR0|very, very long way to go. The United 
20110119143441.000|20110119143444.000|TR0|States is the leader and has been no many 
20110119143444.000|20110119143447.000|TR0|years in innovation and technology.  But 
20110119143447.000|20110119143450.000|TR0|the Chinese have long and very detailed 
20110119143450.000|20110119143453.000|TR0|national strategies for how to promote 
20110119143453.000|20110119143457.000|TR0|their own country. And in the United 
20110119143457.000|20110119143500.000|TR0|States, critics would say in the United 
20110119143500.000|20110119143503.000|TR0|States we have national strategies that go 
20110119143503.000|20110119143506.000|TR0|about two to four years depending on the 
20110119143506.000|20110119143509.000|TR0|elections and what election you're talking 
20110119143509.000|20110119143512.000|TR0|about.
20110119143512.000|20110119143515.000|TR0|
20110119143515.000|20110119143518.000|TR0|So, this is a -- look.  We are partners.  
20110119143518.000|20110119143521.000|TR0|Our success for each company -- country, 
20110119143521.000|20110119143524.000|TR0|rather, country, actually, if you will -- 
20110119143524.000|20110119143527.000|TR0|relies on the other.  But at the same 
20110119143527.000|20110119143530.000|TR0|time, we're also competitors and that's an 
20110119143530.000|20110119143533.000|TR0|interesting place to be at this juncture.
20110119143533.000|20110119143536.000|TR0|
20110119143536.000|20110119143539.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  OK.  Christine Romans, thanks 
20110119143539.000|20110119143542.000|TR0|so much.
20110119143542.000|20110119143545.000|TR0|
20110119143545.000|20110119143548.000|TR0|We're going to talk more about the 
20110119143548.000|20110119143551.000|TR0|meetings that President Hu will be having 
20110119143551.000|20110119143554.000|TR0|and the contingent that he has been 
20110119143554.000|20110119143558.000|TR0|traveling with -- the Chinese contingent 
20110119143558.000|20110119143601.000|TR0|-- and why it's so important and pivotal, 
20110119143601.000|20110119143604.000|TR0|certain American companies he will be 
20110119143604.000|20110119143607.000|TR0|meeting with during this visit.
20110119143607.000|20110119143610.000|TR0|
20110119143610.000|20110119143613.000|TR0|We'll have much more -- our live coverage 
20110119143613.000|20110119143616.000|TR0|of the White House South Lawn, live 
20110119143616.000|20110119143619.000|TR0|pictures right now, President Hu Jintao 
20110119143619.000|20110119143622.000|TR0|and President Barack Obama.
20110119143622.000|20110119143625.000|TR0|
20110119143625.000|20110119143628.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110119143628.000|20110119143631.000|TR0|
20110119143631.000|20110119143634.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Welcome back.  We continue to 
20110119143634.000|20110119143637.000|TR0|watch President Hu Jintao of China, there 
20110119143637.000|20110119143640.000|TR0|speaking on the South Lawn of the White 
20110119143640.000|20110119143643.000|TR0|House, following President Barack Obama, 
20110119143643.000|20110119143646.000|TR0|who talked about this hopefully being a 
20110119143646.000|20110119143649.000|TR0|new day in terms of relations between the 
20110119143649.000|20110119143652.000|TR0|U.S. and China, especially as it pertains 
20110119143652.000|20110119143656.000|TR0|to these growing economies.
20110119143656.000|20110119143659.000|TR0|
20110119143659.000|20110119143702.000|TR0|And President Hu Jintao apparently just 
20110119143702.000|20110119143705.000|TR0|said that, you know, he is seeing some 
20110119143705.000|20110119143708.000|TR0|progress, particularly in the Obama 
20110119143708.000|20110119143711.000|TR0|administration.  Our business 
20110119143711.000|20110119143714.000|TR0|correspondent Christine Romans is also 
20110119143714.000|20110119143717.000|TR0|listening.  She, from her perch in New 
20110119143717.000|20110119143720.000|TR0|York.  And our senior White House 
20110119143720.000|20110119143723.000|TR0|correspondent Ed Henry is also listening.  
20110119143723.000|20110119143726.000|TR0|In fact, he's there at the White House.
20110119143726.000|20110119143729.000|TR0|
20110119143729.000|20110119143732.000|TR0|Let me go back to Christine Romans.
20110119143732.000|20110119143735.000|TR0|
20110119143735.000|20110119143738.000|TR0|And Christine, as the two are shaking 
20110119143738.000|20110119143741.000|TR0|hands here and beginning now their 
20110119143741.000|20110119143744.000|TR0|official visit together, we know that they 
20110119143744.000|20110119143747.000|TR0|had an informal meeting last night.  Note 
20110119143747.000|20110119143750.000|TR0|takers were there.  But apparently they 
20110119143750.000|20110119143753.000|TR0|did have an informal meeting last night.  
20110119143753.000|20110119143757.000|TR0|Hillary Clinton was there, as well.  This 
20110119143757.000|20110119143800.000|TR0|evening, there will be a state dinner.  
20110119143800.000|20110119143803.000|TR0|Now, part of the agenda for President Hu, 
20110119143803.000|20110119143806.000|TR0|he and his contingent will be meeting with 
20110119143806.000|20110119143809.000|TR0|a number of American companies, including 
20110119143809.000|20110119143812.000|TR0|that of GE, as you had just mentioned 
20110119143812.000|20110119143815.000|TR0|earlier, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, 
20110119143815.000|20110119143818.000|TR0|Motorola.
20110119143818.000|20110119143821.000|TR0|
20110119143821.000|20110119143824.000|TR0|Why is it so important to have these 
20110119143824.000|20110119143827.000|TR0|face-to-face encounters with these 
20110119143827.000|20110119143830.000|TR0|American companies while here?
20110119143830.000|20110119143833.000|TR0|
20110119143833.000|20110119143836.000|TR0|ROMANS:  I think it's a symbol of the fact 
20110119143836.000|20110119143839.000|TR0|many of these companies have been doing 
20110119143839.000|20110119143842.000|TR0|business in China and with China for 
20110119143842.000|20110119143845.000|TR0|years.  And it has been, quite frankly, a 
20110119143845.000|20110119143848.000|TR0|relationship that depending on the 
20110119143848.000|20110119143851.000|TR0|different industry, there have been 
20110119143851.000|20110119143854.000|TR0|concerns and successes about how far 
20110119143854.000|20110119143858.000|TR0|they've managed to get in.
20110119143858.000|20110119143901.000|TR0|
20110119143901.000|20110119143904.000|TR0|You know, China is a huge middle class and 
20110119143904.000|20110119143907.000|TR0|growing middle class.  I mean, it is the 
20110119143907.000|20110119143910.000|TR0|Holy Grail for any company looking for big 
20110119143910.000|20110119143913.000|TR0|growth.  We know that GM now sells more 
20110119143913.000|20110119143916.000|TR0|cars in China than it does in the U.S. But 
20110119143916.000|20110119143919.000|TR0|those cars are made in China with Chinese 
20110119143919.000|20110119143922.000|TR0|workers, Chinese parts and the profits are 
20110119143922.000|20110119143925.000|TR0|-- you know, benefit China and the balance 
20110119143925.000|20110119143928.000|TR0|sheet in China.
20110119143928.000|20110119143931.000|TR0|
20110119143931.000|20110119143934.000|TR0|So the question is, how do you make money 
20110119143934.000|20110119143937.000|TR0|and how do you open up China for these 
20110119143937.000|20110119143940.000|TR0|businesses?  And to this point, I'll tell 
20110119143940.000|20110119143943.000|TR0|you the big story that most people talk 
20110119143943.000|20110119143946.000|TR0|about when they talk about China and 
20110119143946.000|20110119143949.000|TR0|business is that so many American 
20110119143949.000|20110119143952.000|TR0|companies have moved their factories 
20110119143952.000|20110119143956.000|TR0|because of low wages, subsidized campuses 
20110119143956.000|20110119143959.000|TR0|that they can use for their production, 
20110119143959.000|20110119144002.000|TR0|you know, that just simply the labor 
20110119144002.000|20110119144005.000|TR0|chain, the difference in the labor, lower 
20110119144005.000|20110119144008.000|TR0|environmental standards, and all that kind 
20110119144008.000|20110119144011.000|TR0|of stuff made it much cheaper to produce 
20110119144011.000|20110119144014.000|TR0|things in China.
20110119144014.000|20110119144017.000|TR0|
20110119144017.000|20110119144020.000|TR0|But that story has changed.  And as I said 
20110119144020.000|20110119144023.000|TR0|a moment earlier, it used to be toys and 
20110119144023.000|20110119144026.000|TR0|trinkets and T-shirts.  And now the 
20110119144026.000|20110119144029.000|TR0|Chinese have moved up the food chain of 
20110119144029.000|20110119144032.000|TR0|very skilled manufacturing in that 
20110119144032.000|20110119144035.000|TR0|country.  One thing that concerns business 
20110119144035.000|20110119144038.000|TR0|folks here is that from the factory floor 
20110119144038.000|20110119144041.000|TR0|comes innovation.  And the Chinese are 
20110119144041.000|20110119144044.000|TR0|rapidly expanding their ability to make 
20110119144044.000|20110119144047.000|TR0|higher end products all the time with 
20110119144047.000|20110119144050.000|TR0|higher margins.
20110119144050.000|20110119144053.000|TR0|
20110119144053.000|20110119144057.000|TR0|And what does that mean for those 
20110119144057.000|20110119144100.000|TR0|manufacturers and those workers in this 
20110119144100.000|20110119144103.000|TR0|country?  That's a bit of soul searching 
20110119144103.000|20110119144106.000|TR0|30 years into this relationship and this 
20110119144106.000|20110119144109.000|TR0|business arrangement between China and the 
20110119144109.000|20110119144112.000|TR0|United States.  We are codependent nations 
20110119144112.000|20110119144115.000|TR0|that is for sure and this codependency 
20110119144115.000|20110119144118.000|TR0|changes every day.
20110119144118.000|20110119144121.000|TR0|
20110119144121.000|20110119144124.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  OK. Which helps bring me -- 
20110119144124.000|20110119144127.000|TR0|Christine, thanks so much -- the U.S., of 
20110119144127.000|20110119144130.000|TR0|course, wants to promote exports to China. 
20110119144130.000|20110119144133.000|TR0| They want a greater Chinese investments 
20110119144133.000|20110119144136.000|TR0|in the U.S.
20110119144136.000|20110119144139.000|TR0|
20110119144139.000|20110119144142.000|TR0|So, Ed henry, senior White House 
20110119144142.000|20110119144145.000|TR0|correspondent, I'm wondering what does 
20110119144145.000|20110119144148.000|TR0|China want out of the U.S.?  We know what 
20110119144148.000|20110119144151.000|TR0|the U.S. wants.
20110119144151.000|20110119144155.000|TR0|
20110119144155.000|20110119144158.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110119144158.000|20110119144201.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they want to know 
20110119144201.000|20110119144204.000|TR0|that they will continue to be able to 
20110119144204.000|20110119144207.000|TR0|invest here in the United States.  They 
20110119144207.000|20110119144210.000|TR0|also want to know that there's going to be 
20110119144210.000|20110119144213.000|TR0|cooperation moving forward and that 
20110119144213.000|20110119144216.000|TR0|there's going to be kind of a working 
20110119144216.000|20110119144219.000|TR0|partnership here.
20110119144219.000|20110119144222.000|TR0|
20110119144222.000|20110119144225.000|TR0|As you note, there have been tensions, 
20110119144225.000|20110119144228.000|TR0|particularly in recent months, both on the 
20110119144228.000|20110119144231.000|TR0|national security and the economic front.  
20110119144231.000|20110119144234.000|TR0|As China rises, it wants to make sure 
20110119144234.000|20110119144237.000|TR0|that, you know, this is not an adversarial 
20110119144237.000|20110119144240.000|TR0|relationship, just as the U.S. doesn't 
20110119144240.000|20110119144243.000|TR0|want it to be.
20110119144243.000|20110119144246.000|TR0|
20110119144246.000|20110119144249.000|TR0|I think the way President Obama put it 
20110119144249.000|20110119144252.000|TR0|when he said, look, we can compete, he 
20110119144252.000|20110119144256.000|TR0|said in his remarks, but we can also 
20110119144256.000|20110119144259.000|TR0|cooperate in so many areas for our mutual 
20110119144259.000|20110119144302.000|TR0|benefit.  Also worth noting the president 
20110119144302.000|20110119144305.000|TR0|said that he expects that the rights of 
20110119144305.000|20110119144308.000|TR0|all people will be respected.  A very 
20110119144308.000|20110119144311.000|TR0|gentle mention, if you will, of human 
20110119144311.000|20110119144314.000|TR0|rights issues that are on the table.
20110119144314.000|20110119144317.000|TR0|
20110119144317.000|20110119144320.000|TR0|We expect that behind closed doors, these 
20110119144320.000|20110119144323.000|TR0|are sort of the pleasantries that are 
20110119144323.000|20110119144326.000|TR0|exchanged.  And you will hear gentle 
20110119144326.000|20110119144329.000|TR0|admonishments about where they disagree.  
20110119144329.000|20110119144332.000|TR0|That behind closed doors, we expect it'll 
20110119144332.000|20110119144335.000|TR0|be a bit tougher in terms of the language, 
20110119144335.000|20110119144338.000|TR0|Fred.
20110119144338.000|20110119144341.000|TR0|
20110119144341.000|20110119144344.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  Ed Henry, 
20110119144344.000|20110119144347.000|TR0|Christine Romans, thanks so much.
20110119144347.000|20110119144350.000|TR0|
20110119144350.000|20110119144354.000|TR0|We're going to take a short break and 
20110119144354.000|20110119144357.000|TR0|we'll get back to the NEWSROOM right after 
20110119144357.000|20110119144400.000|TR0|this.
20110119144400.000|20110119144403.000|TR0|
20110119144403.000|20110119144406.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110119144406.000|20110119144409.000|TR0|
20110119144409.000|20110119144412.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  While at the White House, 
20110119144412.000|20110119144415.000|TR0|President Obama and Chinese President Hu 
20110119144415.000|20110119144418.000|TR0|Jintao are beginning their bilateral 
20110119144418.000|20110119144421.000|TR0|talks, just further up Pennsylvania 
20110119144421.000|20110119144424.000|TR0|Avenue, some serious talks about health 
20110119144424.000|20110119144427.000|TR0|care reform on Capitol Hill.
20110119144427.000|20110119144430.000|TR0|
20110119144430.000|20110119144433.000|TR0|And now there could be more states joining 
20110119144433.000|20110119144436.000|TR0|the legal battle against the health care 
20110119144436.000|20110119144439.000|TR0|reforms.  Florida wants six more states 
20110119144439.000|20110119144442.000|TR0|added to the federal lawsuit.  They are 
20110119144442.000|20110119144445.000|TR0|the states that you see right here in red. 
20110119144445.000|20110119144448.000|TR0|In blue, the 20 states already taking 
20110119144448.000|20110119144451.000|TR0|part.  And that would make a total of 26 
20110119144451.000|20110119144455.000|TR0|states in this lawsuit.  Add a couple more 
20110119144455.000|20110119144458.000|TR0|in yellow and Virginia has already filed a 
20110119144458.000|20110119144501.000|TR0|separate complaint.  And Oklahoma, which 
20110119144501.000|20110119144504.000|TR0|plans to do the same.  All these states 
20110119144504.000|20110119144507.000|TR0|claim the new laws are unconstitutional.
20110119144507.000|20110119144510.000|TR0|
20110119144510.000|20110119144513.000|TR0|So this is it.  After months of wrangling 
20110119144513.000|20110119144516.000|TR0|and weeks of debate, lawmakers in the 
20110119144516.000|20110119144519.000|TR0|House will vote today on repealing the new 
20110119144519.000|20110119144522.000|TR0|health care reforms.  And Republicans have 
20110119144522.000|20110119144525.000|TR0|almost certainly the votes to knock it 
20110119144525.000|20110119144528.000|TR0|down in the House.
20110119144528.000|20110119144531.000|TR0|
20110119144531.000|20110119144534.000|TR0|CNN's Jim Acosta is on Capitol Hill.  So, 
20110119144534.000|20110119144537.000|TR0|walk us through what is likely to happen 
20110119144537.000|20110119144540.000|TR0|today.
20110119144540.000|20110119144543.000|TR0|
20110119144543.000|20110119144546.000|TR0|JIM ACOSTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110119144546.000|20110119144549.000|TR0|Fredricka, if there are no big surprises, 
20110119144549.000|20110119144552.000|TR0|House Republicans should be able to 
20110119144552.000|20110119144556.000|TR0|deliver on a campaign promise and pass 
20110119144556.000|20110119144559.000|TR0|their bill to repeal President Obama's 
20110119144559.000|20110119144602.000|TR0|health care law.
20110119144602.000|20110119144605.000|TR0|
20110119144605.000|20110119144608.000|TR0|Because Republicans have a pretty big 
20110119144608.000|20110119144611.000|TR0|majority in the House, it should pass by a 
20110119144611.000|20110119144614.000|TR0|comfortable margin.  It's expected to 
20110119144614.000|20110119144617.000|TR0|happen later on this evening.  And if you 
20110119144617.000|20110119144620.000|TR0|remember, there was that kerfuffle that 
20110119144620.000|20110119144623.000|TR0|broke out before the events in Tucson, 
20110119144623.000|20110119144626.000|TR0|over the use of the term "job killing." In 
20110119144626.000|20110119144629.000|TR0|the repeal bill the term "job killing" 
20110119144629.000|20110119144632.000|TR0|appeals there.  And there was not much of 
20110119144632.000|20110119144635.000|TR0|a mention of that phrase yesterday. 
20110119144635.000|20110119144638.000|TR0|Lawmakers tried to avoid those types of 
20110119144638.000|20110119144641.000|TR0|loaded phrases in talking about this 
20110119144641.000|20110119144644.000|TR0|legislation.  But there were a couple of 
20110119144644.000|20110119144647.000|TR0|instances and this one exchange that went 
20110119144647.000|20110119144650.000|TR0|on between a new Republican in the House, 
20110119144650.000|20110119144654.000|TR0|Tom Reed and a Democrat, Debbie Wasserman 
20110119144654.000|20110119144657.000|TR0|Schultz.

20110119144706.000|20110119144709.000|TR0|REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK:  I rise today 
20110119144709.000|20110119144712.000|TR0|in support of the repeal of the job 
20110119144712.000|20110119144715.000|TR0|killing Obama care legislation.  This bill 
20110119144715.000|20110119144718.000|TR0|a whopping 2,500 pages, a monstrosity of 
20110119144718.000|20110119144721.000|TR0|new spending and government bureaucracy. 
20110119144721.000|20110119144724.000|TR0|Rushed to approval after only 48 hours of 
20110119144724.000|20110119144727.000|TR0|arm twisting and deal making.
20110119144727.000|20110119144730.000|TR0|
20110119144730.000|20110119144733.000|TR0|REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D), 
20110119144733.000|20110119144736.000|TR0|FLORIDA:  And I challenge our colleagues 
20110119144736.000|20110119144739.000|TR0|on the other side of the aisle -- on the 
20110119144739.000|20110119144742.000|TR0|Republican side of the aisle -- who are 
20110119144742.000|20110119144745.000|TR0|vociferously advocating the repeal of 
20110119144745.000|20110119144748.000|TR0|health care reform on the premise that it 
20110119144748.000|20110119144751.000|TR0|is a job killer.  To name one area of 
20110119144751.000|20110119144755.000|TR0|health care, one, where there have been 
20110119144755.000|20110119144758.000|TR0|job losses.  I would suspect that we would 
20110119144758.000|20110119144801.000|TR0|hear crickets chirping because there are 
20110119144801.000|20110119144804.000|TR0|none.
20110119144804.000|20110119144807.000|TR0|
20110119144807.000|20110119144810.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110119144810.000|20110119144813.000|TR0|
20110119144813.000|20110119144816.000|TR0|ACOSTA:  And so there you had a crickets 
20110119144816.000|20110119144819.000|TR0|chirping.  The debate is expected to get 
20110119144819.000|20110119144822.000|TR0|started later on today.  And that is about 
20110119144822.000|20110119144825.000|TR0|as testy as it got.  The debate was really 
20110119144825.000|20110119144828.000|TR0|more policy driven than personal.
20110119144828.000|20110119144831.000|TR0|
20110119144831.000|20110119144834.000|TR0|And for those of you who -- who are 
20110119144834.000|20110119144837.000|TR0|enjoying this health care debate, get your 
20110119144837.000|20110119144840.000|TR0|fill of it now because this legislation is 
20110119144840.000|20110119144843.000|TR0|expected to go nowhere in the Senate where 
20110119144843.000|20110119144846.000|TR0|the Majority Leader Harry Reid -- remember 
20110119144846.000|20110119144849.000|TR0|the Senate is still in the control of the 
20110119144849.000|20110119144853.000|TR0|Democrats -- has indicated he is not going 
20110119144853.000|20110119144856.000|TR0|to bring this bill up for a vote -- for a 
20110119144856.000|20110119144859.000|TR0|vote -- Fredricka.
20110119144859.000|20110119144902.000|TR0|
20110119144902.000|20110119144905.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  I'm so, despite the fact that 
20110119144905.000|20110119144908.000|TR0|it may be futile in the Senate, meantime, 
20110119144908.000|20110119144911.000|TR0|Republicans are still kind of working on a 
20110119144911.000|20110119144914.000|TR0|replacement bill so they vote in the House 
20110119144914.000|20110119144917.000|TR0|for reform and then there is something 
20110119144917.000|20110119144920.000|TR0|else -- else that they are working on, 
20110119144920.000|20110119144923.000|TR0|some doctoring of a bill?
20110119144923.000|20110119144926.000|TR0|
20110119144926.000|20110119144929.000|TR0|ACOSTA:  That's right.
20110119144929.000|20110119144932.000|TR0|
20110119144932.000|20110119144935.000|TR0|Republicans say this is not just about 
20110119144935.000|20110119144938.000|TR0|repealing the bill and walking away.  They 
20110119144938.000|20110119144941.000|TR0|want to come up with what they call a 
20110119144941.000|20110119144944.000|TR0|replace bill and they are expected to 
20110119144944.000|20110119144947.000|TR0|start talking about that tomorrow.
20110119144947.000|20110119144950.000|TR0|
20110119144950.000|20110119144954.000|TR0|They're going to break out into committees 
20110119144954.000|20110119144957.000|TR0|and start talking about ideas.  Some of 
20110119144957.000|20110119145000.000|TR0|these ideas we've heard about already.  
20110119145000.000|20110119145003.000|TR0|Eric Cantor, the Majority Leader, has 
20110119145003.000|20110119145006.000|TR0|indicated that they -- they will talk 
20110119145006.000|20110119145009.000|TR0|about buying -- being able to buy health 
20110119145009.000|20110119145012.000|TR0|insurance across state lines. They'd like 
20110119145012.000|20110119145015.000|TR0|to see tort reform as part of the equation.
20110119145015.000|20110119145018.000|TR0|
20110119145018.000|20110119145021.000|TR0|And so you're going to see some of this 
20110119145021.000|20110119145024.000|TR0|going on.
20110119145024.000|20110119145027.000|TR0|
20110119145027.000|20110119145030.000|TR0|And the other thing that's going to be 
20110119145030.000|20110119145033.000|TR0|happening on a separate track up here on 
20110119145033.000|20110119145036.000|TR0|Capitol Hill, Fredricka, is this effort to 
20110119145036.000|20110119145039.000|TR0|defund the health care law and -- and 
20110119145039.000|20110119145042.000|TR0|you're going to see Republicans working on 
20110119145042.000|20110119145045.000|TR0|that end of it as well trying to take 
20110119145045.000|20110119145048.000|TR0|money away from the Department of Health 
20110119145048.000|20110119145052.000|TR0|and Human Services that might go to 
20110119145052.000|20110119145055.000|TR0|implementing the health care law and money 
20110119145055.000|20110119145058.000|TR0|going to the IRS because the IRS is part 
20110119145058.000|20110119145101.000|TR0|of the enforcement mechanism of this law 
20110119145101.000|20110119145104.000|TR0|later on down the road.
20110119145104.000|20110119145107.000|TR0|
20110119145107.000|20110119145110.000|TR0|So you're going to see Republicans going 
20110119145110.000|20110119145113.000|TR0|after those two elements as this process 
20110119145113.000|20110119145116.000|TR0|moves forward -- Fredricka.
20110119145116.000|20110119145119.000|TR0|
20110119145119.000|20110119145122.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Jim -- Jim Acosta, thanks so 
20110119145122.000|20110119145125.000|TR0|much on Capitol Hill.  A very busy day in 
20110119145125.000|20110119145128.000|TR0|Washington from Capitol Hill down to the 
20110119145128.000|20110119145131.000|TR0|White House as well.  We'll have much more 
20110119145131.000|20110119145134.000|TR0|in the NEWSROOM right after this.

20110119145143.000|20110119145146.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  A look at our top stories now.
20110119145146.000|20110119145149.000|TR0|
20110119145149.000|20110119145153.000|TR0|You have to see this incredible video out 
20110119145153.000|20110119145156.000|TR0|of Philadelphia.  Local station WCAU 
20110119145156.000|20110119145159.000|TR0|captured this raging fireball.  A gas main 
20110119145159.000|20110119145202.000|TR0|exploded killing one utilities worker and 
20110119145202.000|20110119145205.000|TR0|injuring five other people.
20110119145205.000|20110119145208.000|TR0|
20110119145208.000|20110119145211.000|TR0|And long before the tragic Tucson mass 
20110119145211.000|20110119145214.000|TR0|shooting, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords 
20110119145214.000|20110119145217.000|TR0|told her husband she was worried about her 
20110119145217.000|20110119145220.000|TR0|own safety.  Her husband said the two 
20110119145220.000|20110119145223.000|TR0|talked about it several times and things 
20110119145223.000|20110119145226.000|TR0|happened just as they had discussed.  
20110119145226.000|20110119145229.000|TR0|Giffords had gotten death threats and felt 
20110119145229.000|20110119145232.000|TR0|the political debate was getting 
20110119145232.000|20110119145235.000|TR0|overheated.
20110119145235.000|20110119145238.000|TR0|
20110119145238.000|20110119145241.000|TR0|And Sargent Shriver, the man responsible 
20110119145241.000|20110119145244.000|TR0|for launching the Peace Corps after 
20110119145244.000|20110119145247.000|TR0|marrying into the Kennedy family, has 
20110119145247.000|20110119145250.000|TR0|died.  Shriver also won the Freedom, the 
20110119145250.000|20110119145254.000|TR0|Medal of Freedom, rather, the nation's 
20110119145254.000|20110119145257.000|TR0|highest civilian honor in a life devoted 
20110119145257.000|20110119145300.000|TR0|to public service.  His daughter Maria 
20110119145300.000|20110119145303.000|TR0|said he suffered from Alzheimer's for 
20110119145303.000|20110119145306.000|TR0|years and she remembers him as a gentle 
20110119145306.000|20110119145309.000|TR0|man.

20110119145321.000|20110119145324.000|TR0|DAUGHTER:  Sometimes, he doesn't say 
20110119145324.000|20110119145327.000|TR0|anything.  But sometimes he'll say, 
20110119145327.000|20110119145330.000|TR0|"You're beautiful."  And I'll say to him 
20110119145330.000|20110119145333.000|TR0|"I'm your daughter, Maria."  And he goes, 
20110119145333.000|20110119145336.000|TR0|"You are?"  I go, "I am.  You're my dad."  
20110119145336.000|20110119145339.000|TR0|And he goes, "Wow."

20110119145355.000|20110119145358.000|TR0|And some new developments to pass along in 
20110119145358.000|20110119145401.000|TR0|the Tucson shooting rampage.  "The 
20110119145401.000|20110119145404.000|TR0|Washington Post" is reporting that a 
20110119145404.000|20110119145407.000|TR0|surveillance tape shows suspect Jared 
20110119145407.000|20110119145410.000|TR0|Loughner approaching Congresswoman 
20110119145410.000|20110119145413.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.  The newspaper says 
20110119145413.000|20110119145416.000|TR0|that he can be seen clearly raising the 
20110119145416.000|20110119145419.000|TR0|gun and shooting her in the head just 
20110119145419.000|20110119145422.000|TR0|about two or three feet away.
20110119145422.000|20110119145425.000|TR0|
20110119145425.000|20110119145428.000|TR0|And former classmates have described the 
20110119145428.000|20110119145431.000|TR0|accused shooter as being odd and his 
20110119145431.000|20110119145434.000|TR0|behavior, somewhat unnerving.  And now, 
20110119145434.000|20110119145437.000|TR0|there are reports that he also used drugs. 
20110119145437.000|20110119145440.000|TR0| A former friend tells ABC news that 
20110119145440.000|20110119145443.000|TR0|Loughner smoked pot and ingested 
20110119145443.000|20110119145446.000|TR0|hallucinogens such as mushrooms and the 
20110119145446.000|20110119145449.000|TR0|herbs salvia.  As of now, no evidence 
20110119145449.000|20110119145453.000|TR0|suggesting that drug use is linked to the 
20110119145453.000|20110119145456.000|TR0|rampage that killed six people and 
20110119145456.000|20110119145459.000|TR0|wounding 13 others. And here's a measure 
20110119145459.000|20110119145502.000|TR0|of just how many people have been touched 
20110119145502.000|20110119145505.000|TR0|by the tragedy.  This is a candle light 
20110119145505.000|20110119145508.000|TR0|vigil held hundreds of miles away in 
20110119145508.000|20110119145511.000|TR0|southern California.  Claremont College 
20110119145511.000|20110119145514.000|TR0|invited the campus and the community to 
20110119145514.000|20110119145517.000|TR0|show support for those killed and those

20110119145523.000|20110119145526.000|TR0|And there may be some good news to pass 
20110119145526.000|20110119145529.000|TR0|along on Congresswoman Giffords.  Her 
20110119145529.000|20110119145532.000|TR0|parents have sent an e-mail to friends and 
20110119145532.000|20110119145535.000|TR0|supporters saying Giffords will now be 
20110119145535.000|20110119145538.000|TR0|flown for Texas on Friday to begin rehab.

20110119145551.000|20110119145554.000|TR0|As she gets a little bit better each day.  
20110119145554.000|20110119145557.000|TR0|Every day I feel she's improving.  And as 
20110119145557.000|20110119145600.000|TR0|long as she stays on that slope, I'm 
20110119145600.000|20110119145603.000|TR0|confident she's going to make a full

20110119145606.000|20110119145609.000|TR0|
20110119145609.000|20110119145612.000|TR0|I don't know how long it's going to take.  
20110119145612.000|20110119145615.000|TR0|She's certainly going to go from here to 
20110119145615.000|20110119145618.000|TR0|some -- at some point to some kind of 
20110119145618.000|20110119145621.000|TR0|rehab facility.

20110119145627.000|20110119145630.000|TR0|people ask us, when's Gabby going to come 
20110119145630.000|20110119145633.000|TR0|back.  And I know you can't predict that.  
20110119145633.000|20110119145636.000|TR0|And I know the doctors can't predict that.

20110119145639.000|20110119145642.000|TR0|KELLY:  Yes.

20110119145645.000|20110119145648.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But -- as you try to 
20110119145648.000|20110119145652.000|TR0|look forward, do you see her returning to 
20110119145652.000|20110119145655.000|TR0|public service?
20110119145655.000|20110119145658.000|TR0|
20110119145658.000|20110119145701.000|TR0|KELLY:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, she is 
20110119145701.000|20110119145704.000|TR0|tough.  I mean, she is -- I mean, they've 
20110119145704.000|20110119145707.000|TR0|seen -- they've seen how tough she is.  
20110119145707.000|20110119145710.000|TR0|From the time she showed up here in the 
20110119145710.000|20110119145713.000|TR0|emergency room and how tough she is today. 
20110119145713.000|20110119145716.000|TR0|And I am certain that she'll be -- she'll 
20110119145716.000|20110119145719.000|TR0|be back stronger than ever. And I don't 
20110119145719.000|20110119145722.000|TR0|know if that's in two weeks or two months 
20110119145722.000|20110119145725.000|TR0|but it's coming.

20110119145734.000|20110119145737.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  And in the e-mail from 
20110119145737.000|20110119145740.000|TR0|Giffords' parents they also say that she 
20110119145740.000|20110119145743.000|TR0|is now reading cards from well-wishers and 
20110119145743.000|20110119145746.000|TR0|even scrolled through some photographs on 
20110119145746.000|20110119145750.000|TR0|an iPod.

20110119145808.000|20110119145811.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right, checking news 
20110119145811.000|20110119145814.000|TR0|across the country this morning.
20110119145814.000|20110119145817.000|TR0|
20110119145817.000|20110119145820.000|TR0|New York City is still basking in the 
20110119145820.000|20110119145823.000|TR0|Jets' big NFL playoff win against the New 
20110119145823.000|20110119145826.000|TR0|England Patriots on Sunday.  So a Brooklyn 
20110119145826.000|20110119145829.000|TR0|bagel factory is giving out free bagels 
20110119145829.000|20110119145832.000|TR0|this weekend to honor the Jets. There you 
20110119145832.000|20110119145835.000|TR0|see it right there.  They're dyed in 
20110119145835.000|20110119145838.000|TR0|green, the Jets' team colors, of course.  
20110119145838.000|20110119145841.000|TR0|The team owner says that he may end up 
20110119145841.000|20110119145844.000|TR0|giving away a million free bagels.
20110119145844.000|20110119145847.000|TR0|
20110119145847.000|20110119145851.000|TR0|And in Tennessee a motorist called 911, to 
20110119145851.000|20110119145854.000|TR0|report a tiger by the side of the highway. 
20110119145854.000|20110119145857.000|TR0| Police showed up to check it out, it 
20110119145857.000|20110119145900.000|TR0|turns out it was a stuffed tiger and cub 
20110119145900.000|20110119145903.000|TR0|watching traffic go by.  But somehow it 
20110119145903.000|20110119145906.000|TR0|looked really real.  No one has claimed 
20110119145906.000|20110119145909.000|TR0|the stuffed animals which were still there 
20110119145909.000|20110119145912.000|TR0|by the end of the day.
20110119145912.000|20110119145915.000|TR0|
20110119145915.000|20110119145918.000|TR0|And you might remember Icy the dog.  Do 
20110119145918.000|20110119145921.000|TR0|you remember?  She was rescued after being 
20110119145921.000|20110119145924.000|TR0|found floating down the river in Omaha, 
20110119145924.000|20110119145927.000|TR0|Nebraska.  Icy's owner never claimed her 
20110119145927.000|20110119145930.000|TR0|well, now she has been adopted by the fire 
20110119145930.000|20110119145933.000|TR0|department's paramedic chief.  Icy should 
20110119145933.000|20110119145936.000|TR0|feel right at home.  The chief already has 
20110119145936.000|20110119145939.000|TR0|five other Dalmatians.
