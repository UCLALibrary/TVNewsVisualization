20110119193507.000|20110119193509.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110119193509.000|20110119193511.000|TR0|STATES: We appreciate the dialogue, and we 
20110119193511.000|20110119193514.000|TR0|are looking forward to having dinner with 
20110119193514.000|20110119193516.000|TR0|you later this evening.
20110119193516.000|20110119193519.000|TR0|
20110119193519.000|20110119193521.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (SPEAKING CHINESE)
20110119193521.000|20110119193523.000|TR0|
20110119193523.000|20110119193526.000|TR0|OBAMA:  Thank you, everybody.
20110119193526.000|20110119193528.000|TR0|
20110119193528.000|20110119193531.000|TR0|ALI VELSHI, CNN ANCHOR:  OK.  You've just 
20110119193531.000|20110119193533.000|TR0|watched the end of the press conference.  
20110119193533.000|20110119193535.000|TR0|Very long press conference, hampered by a 
20110119193535.000|20110119193538.000|TR0|very strange technical snafu.  It can't 
20110119193538.000|20110119193540.000|TR0|have been intentional that they did not 
20110119193540.000|20110119193543.000|TR0|have simultaneous translation.  Both the 
20110119193543.000|20110119193545.000|TR0|president looked a bit troubled by that, 
20110119193545.000|20110119193547.000|TR0|and Hu Jintao actually commented he didn't 
20110119193547.000|20110119193550.000|TR0|quite know that was going to happen.  So, 
20110119193550.000|20110119193552.000|TR0|it ended up taking a lot longer than 
20110119193552.000|20110119193555.000|TR0|expected.
20110119193555.000|20110119193557.000|TR0|
20110119193557.000|20110119193559.000|TR0|I want to talk to my guest, Mary Brown 
20110119193559.000|20110119193602.000|TR0|Bullock, about what stood out to you, 
20110119193602.000|20110119193604.000|TR0|other than that technical snafu?  What 
20110119193604.000|20110119193607.000|TR0|stood out to you from what you heard at 
20110119193607.000|20110119193609.000|TR0|that press conference?
20110119193609.000|20110119193612.000|TR0|
20110119193612.000|20110119193614.000|TR0|MARY BROWN BULLOCK, PROFESSOR OF CHINA 
20110119193614.000|20110119193616.000|TR0|STUDIES, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Well, I think 
20110119193616.000|20110119193619.000|TR0|two things.  One, certainly President 
20110119193619.000|20110119193621.000|TR0|Obama hit the high points in U.S./China 
20110119193621.000|20110119193624.000|TR0|relations.  I don't think there's anything 
20110119193624.000|20110119193626.000|TR0|he missed.
20110119193626.000|20110119193628.000|TR0|
20110119193628.000|20110119193631.000|TR0|I thought it was very interesting.  It was 
20110119193631.000|20110119193633.000|TR0|late in his talk, but he did get to the 
20110119193633.000|20110119193636.000|TR0|human rights and even brought in the issue 
20110119193636.000|20110119193638.000|TR0|of Tibet, recognizing sovereignty of China 
20110119193638.000|20110119193640.000|TR0|over Tibet but calling for dialogue with 
20110119193640.000|20110119193643.000|TR0|the Dalai Lama.
20110119193643.000|20110119193645.000|TR0|
20110119193645.000|20110119193648.000|TR0|Certainly he can't be accused in this 
20110119193648.000|20110119193650.000|TR0|presentation of not addressing human 
20110119193650.000|20110119193652.000|TR0|rights.  I thought President Hu -- it was 
20110119193652.000|20110119193655.000|TR0|too bad about the translation issue.  I 
20110119193655.000|20110119193657.000|TR0|thought he also acquitted himself well but 
20110119193657.000|20110119193700.000|TR0|probably more generally.  His comments 
20110119193700.000|20110119193702.000|TR0|were definitely more general natured.
20110119193702.000|20110119193704.000|TR0|
20110119193704.000|20110119193707.000|TR0|VELSHI:  So, in fact, at one point he 
20110119193707.000|20110119193709.000|TR0|talked about promoting denuclearizing in 
20110119193709.000|20110119193712.000|TR0|North Asia.  He was sort of using very 
20110119193712.000|20110119193714.000|TR0|general --
20110119193714.000|20110119193717.000|TR0|
20110119193717.000|20110119193719.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  Very general.  But early on he 
20110119193719.000|20110119193721.000|TR0|did signal one of the messages that will 
20110119193721.000|20110119193724.000|TR0|go to a Chinese audience, and that is 
20110119193724.000|20110119193726.000|TR0|mutual respect including sovereignty -- 
20110119193726.000|20110119193729.000|TR0|including respect for China's sovereignty 
20110119193729.000|20110119193731.000|TR0|and territorial --
20110119193731.000|20110119193733.000|TR0|
20110119193733.000|20110119193736.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  He said they're willing 
20110119193736.000|20110119193738.000|TR0|to engage with Washington on the basis of 
20110119193738.000|20110119193741.000|TR0|mutual respect and the principal of 
20110119193741.000|20110119193743.000|TR0|noninterference in domestic affairs.
20110119193743.000|20110119193745.000|TR0|
20110119193745.000|20110119193748.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  That is code for noninterference 
20110119193748.000|20110119193750.000|TR0|in human rights, noninterference in 
20110119193750.000|20110119193753.000|TR0|minority issues, noninterference in Tibet 
20110119193753.000|20110119193755.000|TR0|or even Taiwan.  So, he didn't spell that 
20110119193755.000|20110119193757.000|TR0|out in detail, but certainly everyone 
20110119193757.000|20110119193800.000|TR0|hearing him knew what he meant.
20110119193800.000|20110119193802.000|TR0|
20110119193802.000|20110119193805.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Any surprises, then, in what they 
20110119193805.000|20110119193807.000|TR0|both did?  So, putting aside their 
20110119193807.000|20110119193809.000|TR0|performance, and they probably both 
20110119193809.000|20110119193812.000|TR0|equipped themselves well for their 
20110119193812.000|20110119193814.000|TR0|domestic audiences -- anything you didn't 
20110119193814.000|20110119193817.000|TR0|expect to hear?  There certainly was no 
20110119193817.000|20110119193819.000|TR0|announcement of deals or understandings 
20110119193819.000|20110119193822.000|TR0|that we didn't go into this knowing about.
20110119193822.000|20110119193824.000|TR0|
20110119193824.000|20110119193826.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  I don't think there were any 
20110119193826.000|20110119193829.000|TR0|surprises.  I think Obama said briefly 
20110119193829.000|20110119193831.000|TR0|that the U.S. had to maintain its forward 
20110119193831.000|20110119193834.000|TR0|position in Asia.  He didn't elaborate 
20110119193834.000|20110119193836.000|TR0|that, but that is certainly signaling that 
20110119193836.000|20110119193838.000|TR0|the U.S. is in Asia to stay, and I think 
20110119193838.000|20110119193841.000|TR0|that was important that he get that in.
20110119193841.000|20110119193843.000|TR0|
20110119193843.000|20110119193846.000|TR0|I think President Hu, in at least finally 
20110119193846.000|20110119193848.000|TR0|addressing the human rights issue --
20110119193848.000|20110119193850.000|TR0|
20110119193850.000|20110119193853.000|TR0|VELSHI:  He, by the way, just so our 
20110119193853.000|20110119193855.000|TR0|audience knows -- it was asked by a 
20110119193855.000|20110119193858.000|TR0|reporter, he didn't answer it and he later 
20110119193858.000|20110119193900.000|TR0|said it was because of the translation 
20110119193900.000|20110119193902.000|TR0|issue.  Which having watched this, it's 
20110119193902.000|20110119193905.000|TR0|entirely possible.
20110119193905.000|20110119193907.000|TR0|
20110119193907.000|20110119193910.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  It appears it was not translated 
20110119193910.000|20110119193912.000|TR0|and that Obama's response was not 
20110119193912.000|20110119193914.000|TR0|initially translated.
20110119193914.000|20110119193917.000|TR0|
20110119193917.000|20110119193919.000|TR0|VELSHI:  And before you answer that, the 
20110119193919.000|20110119193922.000|TR0|next Chinese questioner actually said, "I 
20110119193922.000|20110119193924.000|TR0|would like my question accurately 
20110119193924.000|20110119193927.000|TR0|translated."
20110119193927.000|20110119193929.000|TR0|
20110119193929.000|20110119193931.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  That was fascinating.  Right!
20110119193931.000|20110119193934.000|TR0|
20110119193934.000|20110119193936.000|TR0|VELSHI:  There was something going on 
20110119193936.000|20110119193939.000|TR0|behind the scenes.  But that said, your 
20110119193939.000|20110119193941.000|TR0|thoughts.
20110119193941.000|20110119193943.000|TR0|
20110119193943.000|20110119193946.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  He did finally address the human 
20110119193946.000|20110119193948.000|TR0|rights issue, and I think he said what is 
20110119193948.000|20110119193951.000|TR0|a standard line.  But he said it with some 
20110119193951.000|20110119193953.000|TR0|force, that we do respect universality of 
20110119193953.000|20110119193955.000|TR0|human rights, that we're a developing 
20110119193955.000|20110119193958.000|TR0|country, we're at this particular stage.  
20110119193958.000|20110119194000.000|TR0|We have something to learn from other 
20110119194000.000|20110119194003.000|TR0|countries and pledged continued dialogue.  
20110119194003.000|20110119194005.000|TR0|I don't think anyone expected anything 
20110119194005.000|20110119194007.000|TR0|else from President Hu.
20110119194007.000|20110119194010.000|TR0|
20110119194010.000|20110119194012.000|TR0|VELSHI:  OK.  You hit on something that I 
20110119194012.000|20110119194015.000|TR0|think is the big confusing thing about 
20110119194015.000|20110119194017.000|TR0|China.  It is, on many levels, a 
20110119194017.000|20110119194020.000|TR0|developing country.  There are parts of 
20110119194020.000|20110119194022.000|TR0|China which are decidedly impoverished and 
20110119194022.000|20110119194024.000|TR0|going through difficult times, high rates 
20110119194024.000|20110119194027.000|TR0|of illiteracy.  And at the same time, it 
20110119194027.000|20110119194029.000|TR0|is the fastest growing economy in the 
20110119194029.000|20110119194032.000|TR0|world, largest country in the world.  It 
20110119194032.000|20110119194034.000|TR0|is the largest consumer and the fastest 
20110119194034.000|20110119194036.000|TR0|growing consumer of so many raw materials 
20110119194036.000|20110119194039.000|TR0|in the world.
20110119194039.000|20110119194041.000|TR0|
20110119194041.000|20110119194044.000|TR0|So, it is at the same time a developing 
20110119194044.000|20110119194046.000|TR0|country as a major competititor to the 
20110119194046.000|20110119194048.000|TR0|only superpower in the world.  How do they 
20110119194048.000|20110119194051.000|TR0|reconcile that?
20110119194051.000|20110119194053.000|TR0|
20110119194053.000|20110119194056.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  It boggles the mind.  I would 
20110119194056.000|20110119194058.000|TR0|think if I was Chinese, I would feel 
20110119194058.000|20110119194100.000|TR0|somewhat schizophrenic -
20110119194100.000|20110119194103.000|TR0|
20110119194103.000|20110119194105.000|TR0|VELSHI:  We've never had this before, 
20110119194105.000|20110119194108.000|TR0|right?  Anywhere in the world.  We've 
20110119194108.000|20110119194110.000|TR0|never seen something like this.
20110119194110.000|20110119194112.000|TR0|
20110119194112.000|20110119194115.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  No, no.  And of course, their 
20110119194115.000|20110119194117.000|TR0|per capita income, as President Obama 
20110119194117.000|20110119194120.000|TR0|said, is so much lower than America's.  
20110119194120.000|20110119194122.000|TR0|They do have a long way to go.
20110119194122.000|20110119194125.000|TR0|
20110119194125.000|20110119194127.000|TR0|But I think what you do sense is the 
20110119194127.000|20110119194129.000|TR0|momentum and the scale.  You have to 
20110119194129.000|20110119194132.000|TR0|remember that 1.3 billion people and the 
20110119194132.000|20110119194134.000|TR0|education that they are now receiving, 
20110119194134.000|20110119194137.000|TR0|which is getting better every year, and 
20110119194137.000|20110119194139.000|TR0|also the determination.  You know, when 
20110119194139.000|20110119194141.000|TR0|you're in China, you feel that energy, you 
20110119194141.000|20110119194144.000|TR0|feel that commitment --
20110119194144.000|20110119194146.000|TR0|
20110119194146.000|20110119194149.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Sure.
20110119194149.000|20110119194151.000|TR0|
20110119194151.000|20110119194153.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  -- to the people to really excel 
20110119194153.000|20110119194156.000|TR0|and to regain the position they had in an 
20110119194156.000|20110119194158.000|TR0|earlier era.  So, I don't know how you 
20110119194158.000|20110119194201.000|TR0|quantify that.
20110119194201.000|20110119194203.000|TR0|
20110119194203.000|20110119194205.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110119194205.000|20110119194208.000|TR0|
20110119194208.000|20110119194210.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  But you certainly do feel a 
20110119194210.000|20110119194213.000|TR0|civilization on the move.
20110119194213.000|20110119194215.000|TR0|
20110119194215.000|20110119194217.000|TR0|VELSHI:  The question, of course, is 
20110119194217.000|20110119194220.000|TR0|whether that move -- because when China 
20110119194220.000|20110119194222.000|TR0|moves just a little bit, it shakes the 
20110119194222.000|20110119194225.000|TR0|entire world.  So, whether that move 
20110119194225.000|20110119194227.000|TR0|continues to go in the right directions -- 
20110119194227.000|20110119194230.000|TR0| in your evaluation and the time you spent 
20110119194230.000|20110119194232.000|TR0|studying China, where is it going? Is it 
20110119194232.000|20110119194234.000|TR0|going into a place where it is going to be 
20110119194234.000|20110119194237.000|TR0|productive for Chinese and for the rest of 
20110119194237.000|20110119194239.000|TR0|the world?  Are there areas in which it's 
20110119194239.000|20110119194242.000|TR0|headed that we should be worried about?
20110119194242.000|20110119194244.000|TR0|
20110119194244.000|20110119194246.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  I think the last two years China 
20110119194246.000|20110119194249.000|TR0|certainly has been more aggressive in 
20110119194249.000|20110119194251.000|TR0|northeast Asia, and I think that has 
20110119194251.000|20110119194254.000|TR0|worried Americans in a geopolitical sense. 
20110119194254.000|20110119194256.000|TR0| And the continued acceleration of its 
20110119194256.000|20110119194258.000|TR0|military program, even though it's way 
20110119194258.000|20110119194301.000|TR0|below ours.  So I think you worry about 
20110119194301.000|20110119194303.000|TR0|that.
20110119194303.000|20110119194306.000|TR0|
20110119194306.000|20110119194308.000|TR0|I think there have been concerns that, 
20110119194308.000|20110119194310.000|TR0|particularly under President Hu, we have 
20110119194310.000|20110119194313.000|TR0|had a more oppressive regime.  There has 
20110119194313.000|20110119194315.000|TR0|not been a fast movement toward democracy, 
20110119194315.000|20110119194318.000|TR0|which was really a false hope. So we 
20110119194318.000|20110119194320.000|TR0|haven't seen that political movement in 
20110119194320.000|20110119194322.000|TR0|China.  I think I would feel better, I 
20110119194322.000|20110119194325.000|TR0|think many people in this country would 
20110119194325.000|20110119194327.000|TR0|feel better, if you saw these reforms 
20110119194327.000|20110119194330.000|TR0|moving to continue the opening and more 
20110119194330.000|20110119194332.000|TR0|freedoms that Chinese people have.  My 
20110119194332.000|20110119194335.000|TR0|first trip was in 1974.
20110119194335.000|20110119194337.000|TR0|
20110119194337.000|20110119194339.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Wow.
20110119194339.000|20110119194342.000|TR0|
20110119194342.000|20110119194344.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  China is a different country.  
20110119194344.000|20110119194347.000|TR0|The people have so many more opportunities 
20110119194347.000|20110119194349.000|TR0|now, so much more freedom.  They do talk 
20110119194349.000|20110119194351.000|TR0|about politics.  They write.  So, it's not 
20110119194351.000|20110119194354.000|TR0|like it's a closed country, but the issue 
20110119194354.000|20110119194356.000|TR0|of political reform is still out there.
20110119194356.000|20110119194359.000|TR0|
20110119194359.000|20110119194401.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  One last question that 
20110119194401.000|20110119194403.000|TR0|you and I discussed earlier in a break.  
20110119194403.000|20110119194406.000|TR0|That is, for people who are watching us 
20110119194406.000|20110119194408.000|TR0|who are workers, who are businesspeople, 
20110119194408.000|20110119194411.000|TR0|what are our opportunities here in the 
20110119194411.000|20110119194413.000|TR0|United States out of this growing economy 
20110119194413.000|20110119194415.000|TR0|and this growing consumer base over the 
20110119194415.000|20110119194418.000|TR0|next decade or so?
20110119194418.000|20110119194420.000|TR0|
20110119194420.000|20110119194423.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  You know, I tell students -- 
20110119194423.000|20110119194425.000|TR0|high school students graduating, I say, go 
20110119194425.000|20110119194427.000|TR0|to Shanghai for one week.  There was 
20110119194427.000|20110119194430.000|TR0|flight, a Delta flight to Shanghai.  Just 
20110119194430.000|20110119194432.000|TR0|go and feel Shanghai.
20110119194432.000|20110119194435.000|TR0|
20110119194435.000|20110119194437.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  And when you say 
20110119194437.000|20110119194440.000|TR0|electric, this is a city that's building 
20110119194440.000|20110119194442.000|TR0|more buildings than our biggest cities in 
20110119194442.000|20110119194444.000|TR0|the United States actually already have.
20110119194444.000|20110119194447.000|TR0|
20110119194447.000|20110119194449.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  Exactly.  And I think it 
20110119194449.000|20110119194452.000|TR0|actually gives people both something -- 
20110119194452.000|20110119194454.000|TR0|well, it helps give us a competitive 
20110119194454.000|20110119194456.000|TR0|spirit.  I think we need more of that old 
20110119194456.000|20110119194459.000|TR0|American kind of competitive know-how.  
20110119194459.000|20110119194501.000|TR0|Yes, we can improve our education system, 
20110119194501.000|20110119194504.000|TR0|we can transform our technology.
20110119194504.000|20110119194506.000|TR0|
20110119194506.000|20110119194508.000|TR0|I think mom-and-pop stores, that's tough.  
20110119194508.000|20110119194511.000|TR0|How do you do that? How do you change to a 
20110119194511.000|20110119194513.000|TR0|service industry if you've been a 
20110119194513.000|20110119194516.000|TR0|manufacturing industry?
20110119194516.000|20110119194518.000|TR0|
20110119194518.000|20110119194520.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110119194520.000|20110119194523.000|TR0|
20110119194523.000|20110119194525.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  You know, those are the hard 
20110119194525.000|20110119194528.000|TR0|questions for American politics, and we do 
20110119194528.000|20110119194530.000|TR0|have to worry about those protections.
20110119194530.000|20110119194533.000|TR0|
20110119194533.000|20110119194535.000|TR0|I thought Obama was very eloquent in his 
20110119194535.000|20110119194537.000|TR0|repeated talking about jobs.  You could 
20110119194537.000|20110119194540.000|TR0|say this press release - press conference 
20110119194540.000|20110119194542.000|TR0|for President Obama was selling America to 
20110119194542.000|20110119194545.000|TR0|China.
20110119194545.000|20110119194547.000|TR0|
20110119194547.000|20110119194549.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110119194549.000|20110119194552.000|TR0|
20110119194552.000|20110119194554.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  He even said, we have so much to 
20110119194554.000|20110119194557.000|TR0|sell.
20110119194557.000|20110119194559.000|TR0|
20110119194559.000|20110119194601.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  We want to keep selling, 
20110119194601.000|20110119194604.000|TR0|we want to sell you planes, we want to 
20110119194604.000|20110119194606.000|TR0|sell you --
20110119194606.000|20110119194609.000|TR0|
20110119194609.000|20110119194611.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  He's really trying to educate 
20110119194611.000|20110119194613.000|TR0|the United States as he is talking, 
20110119194613.000|20110119194616.000|TR0|whether that's sufficient for Congress, I 
20110119194616.000|20110119194618.000|TR0|don't know.
20110119194618.000|20110119194621.000|TR0|
20110119194621.000|20110119194623.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Mary, great to talk to you.  
20110119194623.000|20110119194625.000|TR0|Thanks so much for being with us.
20110119194625.000|20110119194628.000|TR0|
20110119194628.000|20110119194630.000|TR0|BULLOCK:  Thank you.
20110119194630.000|20110119194633.000|TR0|
20110119194633.000|20110119194635.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Mary Brown Bullock is the 
20110119194635.000|20110119194638.000|TR0|professor -- the president emeritus of the 
20110119194638.000|20110119194640.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) Scott College and 
20110119194640.000|20110119194642.000|TR0|distinguished visiting professor of China 
20110119194642.000|20110119194645.000|TR0|Studies at Emory.
20110119194645.000|20110119194647.000|TR0|
20110119194647.000|20110119194650.000|TR0|Let's go to Ed Henry who was in that room 
20110119194650.000|20110119194652.000|TR0|- with us.  Ed, boy, that was an 
20110119194652.000|20110119194654.000|TR0|interesting press conference.  What did 
20110119194654.000|20110119194657.000|TR0|you and the press corps take away from how 
20110119194657.000|20110119194659.000|TR0|candid or transparent President Hu was?
20110119194659.000|20110119194702.000|TR0|
20110119194702.000|20110119194704.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110119194704.000|20110119194706.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think President Hu 
20110119194706.000|20110119194709.000|TR0|--maybe because of the technical glitch, 
20110119194709.000|20110119194711.000|TR0|he just didn't hear the human rights 
20110119194711.000|20110119194714.000|TR0|question the first time.  It had raised my 
20110119194714.000|20110119194716.000|TR0|eyebrows when he skipped over that.  Maybe 
20110119194716.000|20110119194718.000|TR0|it was literally lost in translation.      
20110119194718.000|20110119194721.000|TR0| But when he got the follow-up question, 
20110119194721.000|20110119194723.000|TR0|he did answer pretty straightforward, at 
20110119194723.000|20110119194726.000|TR0|least on the surface saying, look, I've 
20110119194726.000|20110119194728.000|TR0|talked about this with President Obama 
20110119194728.000|20110119194730.000|TR0|many times.  We've essentially agreed to 
20110119194730.000|20110119194733.000|TR0|disagree, but we've had candid 
20110119194733.000|20110119194735.000|TR0|conversations.  He said what you might 
20110119194735.000|20110119194738.000|TR0|call the right things about look, China is 
20110119194738.000|20110119194740.000|TR0|always concerned about the promotion and 
20110119194740.000|20110119194743.000|TR0|protection of human rights.  China is a 
20110119194743.000|20110119194745.000|TR0|developing country interested in democracy 
20110119194745.000|20110119194747.000|TR0|and the rule of law.  All of that sounds 
20110119194747.000|20110119194750.000|TR0|wonderful in theory.
20110119194750.000|20110119194752.000|TR0|
20110119194752.000|20110119194755.000|TR0|But in practice, it seems far from the 
20110119194755.000|20110119194757.000|TR0|reality of what's really happening in 
20110119194757.000|20110119194759.000|TR0|China today.  So there seemed to be a 
20110119194759.000|20110119194802.000|TR0|deep, deep divide in what President Hu was 
20110119194802.000|20110119194804.000|TR0|trying to sell the world and what's really 
20110119194804.000|20110119194807.000|TR0|going on in China.
20110119194807.000|20110119194809.000|TR0|
20110119194809.000|20110119194811.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right, Ed, was there anything 
20110119194811.000|20110119194814.000|TR0|there -- you have been saying very clearly 
20110119194814.000|20110119194816.000|TR0|to us in the lead-up to this -- the same 
20110119194816.000|20110119194819.000|TR0|question I asked Mary, there was nothing 
20110119194819.000|20110119194821.000|TR0|there that you did not expect to hear, 
20110119194821.000|20110119194823.000|TR0|there were no surprises, putting aside the 
20110119194823.000|20110119194826.000|TR0|delivery of the two leaders and what they 
20110119194826.000|20110119194828.000|TR0|emphasized?  There were no deals, there 
20110119194828.000|20110119194831.000|TR0|was nothing in there that they discussed 
20110119194831.000|20110119194833.000|TR0|that you didn't know was going to happen?
20110119194833.000|20110119194835.000|TR0|
20110119194835.000|20110119194838.000|TR0|HENRY: No.  I really think it was, as we 
20110119194838.000|20110119194840.000|TR0|expected.  Both sides kind of laid out 
20110119194840.000|20110119194843.000|TR0|their markers and their points.  I thought 
20110119194843.000|20110119194845.000|TR0|you were right to highlight what was 
20110119194845.000|20110119194848.000|TR0|essentially the salesman in chief.  I 
20110119194848.000|20110119194850.000|TR0|thought it was fascinating the president 
20110119194850.000|20110119194852.000|TR0|just said, we want to sell you all kinds 
20110119194852.000|20110119194855.000|TR0|of things:  planes, cars, software, you 
20110119194855.000|20110119194857.000|TR0|name it.
20110119194857.000|20110119194900.000|TR0|
20110119194900.000|20110119194902.000|TR0|The fact of the matter is, he realizes, 
20110119194902.000|20110119194904.000|TR0|this president on the American side, that 
20110119194904.000|20110119194907.000|TR0|he's got to do everything he can to not 
20110119194907.000|20110119194909.000|TR0|just try to sell U.S. products abroad, to 
20110119194909.000|20110119194912.000|TR0|try to help dig us out of this awful 
20110119194912.000|20110119194914.000|TR0|unemployment and difficult economic 
20110119194914.000|20110119194916.000|TR0|situation, but he also has to sell the 
20110119194916.000|20110119194919.000|TR0|American people on the idea that Chinese 
20110119194919.000|20110119194921.000|TR0|investment here at home, U.S. trade with 
20110119194921.000|20110119194924.000|TR0|China is not a bad thing.
20110119194924.000|20110119194926.000|TR0|
20110119194926.000|20110119194928.000|TR0|It is a very, very tough sell.  With we 
20110119194928.000|20110119194931.000|TR0|knew that going into the news conference.  
20110119194931.000|20110119194933.000|TR0|But I thought it was interesting that the 
20110119194933.000|20110119194936.000|TR0|president was candid about trying to 
20110119194936.000|20110119194938.000|TR0|address that head-on.
20110119194938.000|20110119194940.000|TR0|
20110119194940.000|20110119194943.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right, Ed.  Good, thanks very 
20110119194943.000|20110119194945.000|TR0|much for covering us. I think you probably 
20110119194945.000|20110119194948.000|TR0|brushed up on your Mandarin as a result of 
20110119194948.000|20110119194950.000|TR0|that press conference.  Our senior White

20110119194955.000|20110119194957.000|TR0|Our coverage, of course, continues later 
20110119194957.000|20110119195000.000|TR0|on today with the state dinner that will 
20110119195000.000|20110119195002.000|TR0|be held in Washington.  We've got more 
20110119195002.000|20110119195005.000|TR0|news for you, by the way.  There's other 
20110119195005.000|20110119195007.000|TR0|stuff is going on, not just China.  I'll 
20110119195007.000|20110119195009.000|TR0|bring it to you right after this break.  
20110119195009.000|20110119195012.000|TR0|Stay with me.

20110119195019.000|20110119195021.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Some developing stories that 
20110119195021.000|20110119195024.000|TR0|we're following for you in the CNN 
20110119195024.000|20110119195026.000|TR0|NEWSROOM. According to an e-mail from her 
20110119195026.000|20110119195029.000|TR0|mother, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords 
20110119195029.000|20110119195031.000|TR0|is doing well enough to be transferred to 
20110119195031.000|20110119195033.000|TR0|a rehab facility in Houston on Friday.
20110119195033.000|20110119195036.000|TR0|
20110119195036.000|20110119195038.000|TR0|It's a week-and-a-half since she was shot 
20110119195038.000|20110119195041.000|TR0|through the brain at a public event.  
20110119195041.000|20110119195043.000|TR0|Giffords has surprised doctor was her 
20110119195043.000|20110119195046.000|TR0|physical and mental capabilities.  Her 
20110119195046.000|20110119195048.000|TR0|mom's e-mail says Giffords will begin 
20110119195048.000|20110119195050.000|TR0|aggressive rehab and be treated by 
20110119195050.000|20110119195053.000|TR0|surgeons who specialize in bullet wounds 
20110119195053.000|20110119195055.000|TR0|to the head.  I do want to note this 
20110119195055.000|20110119195058.000|TR0|development has not been confirmed by the 
20110119195058.000|20110119195100.000|TR0|University Medical Center in Tucson where 
20110119195100.000|20110119195102.000|TR0|Giffords remains in serious condition.

20110119195105.000|20110119195107.000|TR0|Meantime, new details on some of the 
20110119195107.000|20110119195110.000|TR0|security videos that captured the January 
20110119195110.000|20110119195112.000|TR0|8th shooting tragedy.  The Pima County 
20110119195112.000|20110119195114.000|TR0|Sheriff's Department chief investigator 
20110119195114.000|20110119195117.000|TR0|tells us about the key moment.

20110119195126.000|20110119195129.000|TR0|CO. SHERIFF'S DEPT.: There's a portion of 
20110119195129.000|20110119195131.000|TR0|the tape where you can see very clearly 
20110119195131.000|20110119195134.000|TR0|that Jared, the suspect, comes out of one 
20110119195134.000|20110119195136.000|TR0|of the doors.  He walks around a table, a 
20110119195136.000|20110119195138.000|TR0|collapsible-- perhaps a six-foot table.  
20110119195138.000|20110119195141.000|TR0|And when he does so with very significant 
20110119195141.000|20110119195143.000|TR0|purpose, he walks up to the congresswoman, 
20110119195143.000|20110119195146.000|TR0|points a gun at her face, and shoots.

20110119195153.000|20110119195155.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Jared Loughner, by the way, the 
20110119195155.000|20110119195158.000|TR0|suspect, will be in court again on Monday 
20110119195158.000|20110119195200.000|TR0|for a hearing.
20110119195200.000|20110119195203.000|TR0|
20110119195203.000|20110119195205.000|TR0|All right.  A 50-foot fireball lights up a 
20110119195205.000|20110119195207.000|TR0|Philadelphia neighborhood, killing one 
20110119195207.000|20110119195210.000|TR0|person and badly injuring several others. 
20110119195210.000|20110119195212.000|TR0|Residents had reported the strong smell of 
20110119195212.000|20110119195215.000|TR0|gas, so a utilities crew rushed to the 
20110119195215.000|20110119195217.000|TR0|scene.  They found a break in a 
20110119195217.000|20110119195219.000|TR0|high-pressure gas main, and they got to 
20110119195219.000|20110119195222.000|TR0|work.
20110119195222.000|20110119195224.000|TR0|
20110119195224.000|20110119195227.000|TR0|And then a bad sign.  Gas started bubbling 
20110119195227.000|20110119195229.000|TR0|up through the pavement, the whole thing 
20110119195229.000|20110119195231.000|TR0|just went up.  That explosion was so 
20110119195231.000|20110119195234.000|TR0|strong that folks felt it across the 
20110119195234.000|20110119195236.000|TR0|Delaware River in New Jersey.  Later, fire 
20110119195236.000|20110119195239.000|TR0|crews found the body of a 19-year-old 
20110119195239.000|20110119195241.000|TR0|Philadelphia Gas Works employee in the 
20110119195241.000|20110119195243.000|TR0|blast zone.  The cause is still under 
20110119195243.000|20110119195246.000|TR0|investigation.
20110119195246.000|20110119195248.000|TR0|
20110119195248.000|20110119195251.000|TR0|Well, classes are back in session at 
20110119195251.000|20110119195253.000|TR0|Gardena High School a day after two 
20110119195253.000|20110119195256.000|TR0|students were wounded in an apparently 
20110119195256.000|20110119195258.000|TR0|accidental shooting. A boy shot through 
20110119195258.000|20110119195300.000|TR0|the neck is expected to be fine, but a 
20110119195300.000|20110119195303.000|TR0|15-year-old girl who was struck in the 
20110119195303.000|20110119195305.000|TR0|head by the same bullet is in critical 
20110119195305.000|20110119195308.000|TR0|condition.  Los Angeles police say the 
20110119195308.000|20110119195310.000|TR0|student who brought the gun to school 
20110119195310.000|20110119195312.000|TR0|faces charges of assault with a deadly 
20110119195312.000|20110119195315.000|TR0|weapon.
20110119195315.000|20110119195317.000|TR0|
20110119195317.000|20110119195320.000|TR0|And a day after reconvening on Capitol 
20110119195320.000|20110119195322.000|TR0|Hill, the House -- these are live pictures 
20110119195322.000|20110119195324.000|TR0|at the House -- the House is about to vote 
20110119195324.000|20110119195327.000|TR0|on a measure that would undo last year's 
20110119195327.000|20110119195329.000|TR0|sweeping health care reforms.  The measure 
20110119195329.000|20110119195332.000|TR0|is likely to pass the new Republican-led 
20110119195332.000|20110119195334.000|TR0|House, and that's about it.  Since 
20110119195334.000|20110119195336.000|TR0|Democrats retain the majority in the 
20110119195336.000|20110119195339.000|TR0|Senate, they don't even plan to bring this 
20110119195339.000|20110119195341.000|TR0|measure to the floor.
20110119195341.000|20110119195344.000|TR0|
20110119195344.000|20110119195346.000|TR0|While doing business in China, I'm going 
20110119195346.000|20110119195348.000|TR0|to talk with the CEO of a company - the 
20110119195348.000|20110119195351.000|TR0|CEO who is part of an important meeting at 
20110119195351.000|20110119195353.000|TR0|the White House between the president and 
20110119195353.000|20110119195356.000|TR0|President Hu Jintao.  We're going to talk 
20110119195356.000|20110119195358.000|TR0|to him after the break.
20110119195358.000|20110119195401.000|TR0|
20110119195401.000|20110119195403.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)     VELSHI:  Well, the 
20110119195403.000|20110119195405.000|TR0|business side of the Chinese president's 
20110119195405.000|20110119195408.000|TR0|state visit to Washington is pretty much 
20110119195408.000|20110119195410.000|TR0|complete.  Tonight comes the hoopla.  The 
20110119195410.000|20110119195413.000|TR0|menu and guests for this evening's state 
20110119195413.000|20110119195415.000|TR0|dinner, the third of the Obama presidency 
20110119195415.000|20110119195417.000|TR0|still haven't been released.  How do we 
20110119195417.000|20110119195420.000|TR0|know House speaker John Boehner and Senate 
20110119195420.000|20110119195422.000|TR0|majority leader Harry Reid were among the 
20110119195422.000|20110119195425.000|TR0|invitees but declined?  Well, we do know 
20110119195425.000|20110119195427.000|TR0|that.  They and others leaders of Congress 
20110119195427.000|20110119195429.000|TR0|will meet with President Hu tomorrow on 
20110119195429.000|20110119195432.000|TR0|Capitol Hill.
20110119195432.000|20110119195434.000|TR0|
20110119195434.000|20110119195437.000|TR0|Later tomorrow, President Hu travels to 
20110119195437.000|20110119195439.000|TR0|the only other U.S. city on his itinerary, 
20110119195439.000|20110119195441.000|TR0|Chicago.  A Chicago businessman from 
20110119195441.000|20110119195444.000|TR0|Motorola is among the chief executives who 
20110119195444.000|20110119195446.000|TR0|met with President Obama and President Hu 
20110119195446.000|20110119195449.000|TR0|at the White House today.  I'm joined now 
20110119195449.000|20110119195451.000|TR0|by the CEO of Motorola Solutions, Greg 
20110119195451.000|20110119195453.000|TR0|Brown.  He's also on the executive 
20110119195453.000|20110119195456.000|TR0|committee of the U.S./China Business 
20110119195456.000|20110119195458.000|TR0|Council.
20110119195458.000|20110119195501.000|TR0|
20110119195501.000|20110119195503.000|TR0|Greg, thanks for being with us.  I hope 
20110119195503.000|20110119195506.000|TR0|the translation you had in your meeting 
20110119195506.000|20110119195508.000|TR0|was more effective than the one we had at 
20110119195508.000|20110119195510.000|TR0|the press conference.  But tell me what 
20110119195510.000|20110119195513.000|TR0|happened in your meeting with President 
20110119195513.000|20110119195515.000|TR0|Obama and President Hu and a whole lot of 
20110119195515.000|20110119195518.000|TR0|CEOs from the U.S. and China.
20110119195518.000|20110119195520.000|TR0|
20110119195520.000|20110119195522.000|TR0|GREG BROWN, CEO, MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS:  I 
20110119195522.000|20110119195525.000|TR0|think it was a relatively abbreviated 
20110119195525.000|20110119195527.000|TR0|meeting but a constructive one, Ali, and 
20110119195527.000|20110119195530.000|TR0|good one.  We talked about mutual 
20110119195530.000|20110119195532.000|TR0|opportunities in creating a bilateral 
20110119195532.000|20110119195534.000|TR0|investment climate, a win-win.  And that 
20110119195534.000|20110119195537.000|TR0|irrespective of the political ebb and 
20110119195537.000|20110119195539.000|TR0|flows, one of the constants has been U.S. 
20110119195539.000|20110119195542.000|TR0|business investment in China.  Motorola 
20110119195542.000|20110119195544.000|TR0|has been in China for two-and-a-half 
20110119195544.000|20110119195546.000|TR0|decades.  So, we talked about some of the 
20110119195546.000|20110119195549.000|TR0|things we both could do together.
20110119195549.000|20110119195551.000|TR0|
20110119195551.000|20110119195554.000|TR0|VELSHI:  And you have been -- Motorola has 
20110119195554.000|20110119195556.000|TR0|been there for a long time.  There have 
20110119195556.000|20110119195559.000|TR0|been a number of American companies.  We 
20110119195559.000|20110119195601.000|TR0|talked about General Motors, which sold 
20110119195601.000|20110119195603.000|TR0|more cars in China last year than the 
20110119195603.000|20110119195606.000|TR0|United States.
20110119195606.000|20110119195608.000|TR0|
20110119195608.000|20110119195611.000|TR0|What are the issues for companies like 
20110119195611.000|20110119195613.000|TR0|yours and others that are well entrenched 
20110119195613.000|20110119195615.000|TR0|in China?  What would you like to see done 
20110119195615.000|20110119195618.000|TR0|differently?  What evolution in that 
20110119195618.000|20110119195620.000|TR0|business relationship that will help you 
20110119195620.000|20110119195623.000|TR0|be more profitable here and employ more 
20110119195623.000|20110119195625.000|TR0|people in the United States could you want 
20110119195625.000|20110119195627.000|TR0|to see?
20110119195627.000|20110119195630.000|TR0|
20110119195630.000|20110119195632.000|TR0|BROWN:  So, I think the relationship and 
20110119195632.000|20110119195635.000|TR0|the experience in China to date has been 
20110119195635.000|20110119195637.000|TR0|very positive, but that said, we did talk 
20110119195637.000|20110119195639.000|TR0|about areas for improvement.  One would be 
20110119195639.000|20110119195642.000|TR0|leveling the playing field, so making sure 
20110119195642.000|20110119195644.000|TR0|that U.S. companies like Motorola 
20110119195644.000|20110119195647.000|TR0|Solutions and others have equal access and 
20110119195647.000|20110119195649.000|TR0|a level playing field to compete for 
20110119195649.000|20110119195651.000|TR0|Chinese government contracts as we go 
20110119195651.000|20110119195654.000|TR0|against indigenous providers within the 
20110119195654.000|20110119195656.000|TR0|country.
20110119195656.000|20110119195659.000|TR0|
20110119195659.000|20110119195701.000|TR0|The second was intellectual property.  A 
20110119195701.000|20110119195704.000|TR0|lot of U.S. multinational companies 
20110119195704.000|20110119195706.000|TR0|develop R  &  D, develop a very 
20110119195706.000|20110119195708.000|TR0|sophisticated patent process, and it's 
20110119195708.000|20110119195711.000|TR0|fundamental that the respect and adherence 
20110119195711.000|20110119195713.000|TR0|to intellecutal property laws and rules an 
20110119195713.000|20110119195716.000|TR0|regulations is very key. Those are two 
20110119195716.000|20110119195718.000|TR0|areas we talked about.  President Hu 
20110119195718.000|20110119195720.000|TR0|acknowledged IPR in one of his comments.  
20110119195720.000|20110119195723.000|TR0|He said it's a high property, it's 
20110119195723.000|20110119195725.000|TR0|evolving and he has every intention of 
20110119195725.000|20110119195728.000|TR0|ensuring equal treatment between U.S. 
20110119195728.000|20110119195730.000|TR0|companies and Chinese companies as we 
20110119195730.000|20110119195732.000|TR0|compete in China.       VELSHI:  And the 
20110119195732.000|20110119195735.000|TR0|preferential treatment that Chinese 
20110119195735.000|20110119195737.000|TR0|companies gets in China has less to do 
20110119195737.000|20110119195740.000|TR0|with U.S. companies.  It's basically -- 
20110119195740.000|20110119195742.000|TR0|the tier is traditionally Chinese 
20110119195742.000|20110119195744.000|TR0|companies have had a certain treatment, 
20110119195744.000|20110119195747.000|TR0|and companies based in other countries 
20110119195747.000|20110119195749.000|TR0|have had a different treatment.  And 
20110119195749.000|20110119195752.000|TR0|you're trying to level that playing field.
20110119195752.000|20110119195754.000|TR0|
20110119195754.000|20110119195756.000|TR0|BROWN:  That's right.  That's right.  So, 
20110119195756.000|20110119195759.000|TR0|whether it be subsidies or, if a U.S. 
20110119195759.000|20110119195801.000|TR0|mulitnational company like Motorola 
20110119195801.000|20110119195804.000|TR0|Solutions comes in to compete for business 
20110119195804.000|20110119195806.000|TR0|in China, making sure that the 
20110119195806.000|20110119195809.000|TR0|requirements and the opportunity to win 
20110119195809.000|20110119195811.000|TR0|the business is equal to a U.S. company or 
20110119195811.000|20110119195813.000|TR0|any other company.  Those are some of the 
20110119195813.000|20110119195816.000|TR0|things we talked about.
20110119195816.000|20110119195818.000|TR0|
20110119195818.000|20110119195821.000|TR0|VELSHI:  For our viewer, Greg, who doesn't 
20110119195821.000|20110119195823.000|TR0|run a big business, what's the bigger 
20110119195823.000|20110119195825.000|TR0|issue in China? Is it greater access to 
20110119195825.000|20110119195828.000|TR0|being able to manufacture more, or is it 
20110119195828.000|20110119195830.000|TR0|getting access to their growing middle 
20110119195830.000|20110119195833.000|TR0|class, which is going to buy more?
20110119195833.000|20110119195835.000|TR0|
20110119195835.000|20110119195837.000|TR0|BROWN:  I think it's open market access 
20110119195837.000|20110119195840.000|TR0|and getting access for U.S. product and 
20110119195840.000|20110119195842.000|TR0|services to the evolving middle class.  
20110119195842.000|20110119195845.000|TR0|So, China's growing at nine percent or 10 
20110119195845.000|20110119195847.000|TR0|percent GDP growth a year.  The U.S. 
20110119195847.000|20110119195849.000|TR0|economy is recovering.  But we want to 
20110119195849.000|20110119195852.000|TR0|make sure we have ample opportunity to 
20110119195852.000|20110119195854.000|TR0|sell all U.S. products and services into 
20110119195854.000|20110119195857.000|TR0|that enormous market that's growing 
20110119195857.000|20110119195859.000|TR0|rapidly.
20110119195859.000|20110119195901.000|TR0|
20110119195901.000|20110119195904.000|TR0|VELSHI:  And, Greg, do you believe that 
20110119195904.000|20110119195906.000|TR0|that will help employ more people in the 
20110119195906.000|20110119195909.000|TR0|United States?
20110119195909.000|20110119195911.000|TR0|
20110119195911.000|20110119195914.000|TR0|BROWN:  Absolutely.  I think for every 
20110119195914.000|20110119195916.000|TR0|billion of exports, it supports 5,000 jobs 
20110119195916.000|20110119195918.000|TR0|here in the U.S.  I do think it's a 
20110119195918.000|20110119195921.000|TR0|misperception that exports takes jobs 
20110119195921.000|20110119195923.000|TR0|away.  Actually, if companies thrive and 
20110119195923.000|20110119195926.000|TR0|export more, it creates and protections 
20110119195926.000|20110119195928.000|TR0|more U.S.-based jobs.  So, I know it will 
20110119195928.000|20110119195930.000|TR0|be good for the U.S.
20110119195930.000|20110119195933.000|TR0|
20110119195933.000|20110119195935.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Greg Brown, good to talk to you.  
20110119195935.000|20110119195938.000|TR0|Thanks very much for telling us what went 
20110119195938.000|20110119195940.000|TR0|on in that meeting.  Greg Brown is the CEO 
20110119195940.000|20110119195942.000|TR0|of Motorola Solutions, joining us from the 
20110119195942.000|20110119195945.000|TR0|White House.
20110119195945.000|20110119195947.000|TR0|
