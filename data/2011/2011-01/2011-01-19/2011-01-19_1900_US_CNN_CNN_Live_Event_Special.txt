20110119193516.089|20110119193518.492|CC1|HAMPERED BY A VERY STRANGE
20110119193518.492|20110119193519.960|CC1|TECHNICAL SNAFU.
20110119193519.960|20110119193521.128|CC1|IT CAN'T HAVE BEEN INTENTIONAL
20110119193521.128|20110119193523.396|CC1|THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE
20110119193523.396|20110119193524.030|CC1|SIMULTANEOUS TRANSLATION.
20110119193524.030|20110119193525.398|CC1|BOTH THE PRESIDENT LOOKED A BIT

20110119193530.003|20110119193531.204|CC1|KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
20110119193531.204|20110119193532.839|CC1|IT ENDED UP TAKING A LOT LONGER
20110119193532.839|20110119193533.440|CC1|THAN EXPECTED.

20110119193543.083|20110119193545.719|CC1|>> WELL, I THINK TWO THINGS.
20110119193545.719|20110119193546.686|CC1|ONE, CERTAINLY PRESIDENT OBAMA
20110119193546.686|20110119193548.655|CC1|HIT THE HIGH POINTS IN
20110119193548.655|20110119193549.322|CC1|U.S./CHINA RELATIONS.
20110119193549.322|20110119193551.458|CC1|I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
20110119193551.458|20110119193551.825|CC1|HE MISSED.
20110119193551.825|20110119193552.725|CC1|I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY
20110119193552.725|20110119193553.126|CC1|INTERESTED.
20110119193553.126|20110119193554.561|CC1|IT WAS LATE IN HIS TALK, BUT HE
20110119193554.561|20110119193556.229|CC1|DID GET TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND
20110119193556.229|20110119193559.098|CC1|EVEN BROUGHT IN THE ISSUE OF

20110119193611.277|20110119193612.011|CC1|CERTAINLY HE CAN'T BE ACCUSED OF
20110119193612.011|20110119193613.146|CC1|NOT ADDRESSING HUMAN RIGHTS.
20110119193613.146|20110119193614.747|CC1|I THOUGHT PRESIDENT HU -- IT WAS
20110119193614.747|20110119193616.716|CC1|TOO BAD ABOUT THE TRANSLATION
20110119193616.716|20110119193618.718|CC1|ISSUE -- ALSO ACQUITTED HIMSELF
20110119193618.718|20110119193619.819|CC1|WELL BUT PROBABLY MORE
20110119193619.819|20110119193620.186|CC1|GENERALLY.

20110119193621.754|20110119193623.856|CC1|MORE GENERAL NATURED.
20110119193623.856|20110119193625.725|CC1|>> AT ONE POINT HE TALKED ABOUT
20110119193625.725|20110119193627.927|CC1|PROMOTING DENUCLEARIZING IN
20110119193627.927|20110119193629.329|CC1|NORTH ASIA.
20110119193629.329|20110119193629.829|CC1|VERY GENERAL.
20110119193629.829|20110119193632.031|CC1|>> EARLY ON HE DID SIGNAL ONE OF
20110119193632.031|20110119193636.803|CC1|THE MESSAGES THAT WILL GO TO A
20110119193636.803|20110119193637.503|CC1|CHINESE AUDIENCE, AND THAT IS

20110119193643.309|20110119193645.378|CC1|>> HE SAID THEY'RE WILLING TO

20110119193648.614|20110119193651.150|CC1|ISSUE OF MUTUAL RESPECT --
20110119193651.150|20110119193652.585|CC1|>> THAT IS CODE FOR

20110119193659.759|20110119193700.827|CC1|SO HE DIDN'T SPELL THAT OUT IN
20110119193700.827|20110119193701.861|CC1|DETAIL, BUT CERTAINLY EVERYONE
20110119193701.861|20110119193703.896|CC1|HEARING HIM KNEW WHAT HE MEANT.
20110119193703.896|20110119193704.931|CC1|>> ANY SURPRISES, THEN, IN WHAT
20110119193704.931|20110119193705.965|CC1|THEY BOTH DID?

20110119193712.338|20110119193712.939|CC1|TH

20110119193718.344|20110119193720.446|CC1|>> I DON'T THINK THERE WERE ANY
20110119193720.446|20110119193720.813|CC1|SURPRISES.
20110119193720.813|20110119193722.014|CC1|I THINK OBAMA SAID BRIEFLY THAT
20110119193722.014|20110119193724.517|CC1|THE U.S. HAD TO MAINTAIN ITS
20110119193724.517|20110119193725.484|CC1|FORWARD POSITION IN ASIA.
20110119193725.484|20110119193727.386|CC1|HE DIDN'T ELABORATE THAT, BUT
20110119193727.386|20110119193728.287|CC1|THAT IS CERTAINLY SIGNALING THAT
20110119193728.287|20110119193730.523|CC1|THE U.S. IS IN ASIA TO STAY, AND
20110119193730.523|20110119193731.791|CC1|I THINK THAT WAS IMPORTANT THAT
20110119193731.791|20110119193733.659|CC1|HE GET THAT IN.
20110119193733.659|20110119193735.661|CC1|I THINK PRESIDENT HU, IN AT

20110119193809.461|20110119193811.230|CC1|BUT HE SAID IT WITH SOME FORCE,

20110119193828.847|20110119193830.315|CC1|THINK IS THE BIG CONFUSING THING

20110119193900.379|20110119193902.447|CC1|>> IT BOGGLES THE MIND.

20110119193905.350|20110119193907.219|CC1|SOMEWHAT SCHIZOPHRENIC.

20110119193908.987|20110119193910.622|CC1|MUCH LOWER THAN AMERICA'S.

20110119193912.457|20110119193914.593|CC1|BUT I THINK WHAT YOU DO SENSE IS
20110119193914.593|20110119193916.061|CC1|THE MOMENTUM AND THE SCALE.
20110119193916.061|20110119193917.796|CC1|YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 1.3

20110119193934.513|20110119193936.314|CC1|SO I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU QUANTIFY

20110119193936.615|20110119193936.982|CC1|>> RIGHT.
20110119193936.982|20110119193938.784|CC1|>> BUT YOU CERTAINLY DO FEEL A
20110119193938.784|20110119193940.118|CC1|CIVILIZATION ON THE MOVE.
20110119193940.118|20110119193942.621|CC1|>> THE QUESTION, OF COURSE, IS
20110119193942.621|20110119193943.755|CC1|WHETHER THAT MOVE -- BECAUSE
20110119193943.755|20110119193945.157|CC1|WHEN CHINA MOVES JUST A LITTLE
20110119193945.157|20110119193947.125|CC1|BIT IT SHAKES THE ENTIRE

20110119193959.137|20110119193959.437|CC1|WORLD?
20110119193959.437|20110119194000.939|CC1|ARE THERE AREAS IN WHICH IT'S
20110119194000.939|20110119194002.641|CC1|HEADED THAT WE SHOULD BE WORRIED

20110119194002.941|20110119194004.943|CC1|>> I THINK THE LAST TWO YEARS
20110119194004.943|20110119194006.811|CC1|CHINA CERTAINLY HAS BEEN MORE
20110119194006.811|20110119194008.380|CC1|AGGRESSIVE IN NORTHEAST ASIA,
20110119194008.380|20110119194010.649|CC1|AND I THINK THAT HAS WORRIED

20110119194013.251|20110119194013.551|CC1|SENSE.
20110119194013.551|20110119194015.387|CC1|AND THE CONTINUED ACCELERATION
20110119194015.387|20110119194016.588|CC1|OF ITS MILITARY PROGRAM, EVEN
20110119194016.588|20110119194018.256|CC1|THOUGH IT'S WAY BELOW OURS.
20110119194018.256|20110119194019.824|CC1|SO I THINK YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT.
20110119194019.824|20110119194022.327|CC1|I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS
20110119194022.327|20110119194023.294|CC1|THAT, PARTICULARLY UNDER
20110119194023.294|20110119194025.830|CC1|PRESIDENT HU, WE HAVE HAD A MORE
20110119194025.830|20110119194027.065|CC1|OPPRESSIVE REGIME.
20110119194027.065|20110119194028.867|CC1|THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FAST

20110119194030.368|20110119194032.437|CC1|WAS REALLY A FALSE HOPE.
20110119194032.437|20110119194033.605|CC1|SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT
20110119194033.605|20110119194035.273|CC1|POLITICAL MOVEMENT IN CHINA.
20110119194035.273|20110119194037.041|CC1|I THINK I WOULD FEEL BETTER, I
20110119194037.041|20110119194038.276|CC1|THINK MANY PEOPLE IN THIS
