20110119184900.799|20110119185112.510|TR1|hello under appeal on the health care bill and that vote has ignited a debate over whether any taxpayer money would end up if this bill goes forward as planned going to abortion can bring this live on this story for us in washington ash and this is a very not big part of this debate over this bill originally and now we're seeing every surface tell us about that moment of course i'll remember this was such a sticking point when it came to getting together enough votes in the house to get healthcare passed there were several pro-life democrats led by representative bart stupak who want to language put into the bill that would specifically prohibit any taxpayer money from going to fund abortion well they did not get that language into the building to remember the president did with similar language into any executive order and for most lawmakers at settled the issue adolescent the bill's been alone for nine months nellie and i'm not seeing the any evidence that he died has been spent to support an abortion anywhere in the country so i think that the intent of the congress very clearly was prohibit the use of public funds for abortion and that in turn has been carried out by the administration but critics say statutory language of the longest always going to trial that executive order that the issue is not settle my son alright will chair the house i has made a in has certainly changed a lot since obama care with pat have turned out as evidence midterm elections to have that kind of impact all of this well it's very encouraging to the pro-life community at least eighty new members identify themselves strongly as pro-life and that changes things we get to go in and funding mechanisms upright advocates have high hopes that during that process they will get that tougher language they were looking for into law including marjorie dan health services in the evening last there is a strong wind behind particularly hitting taxpayer funding of abortion and on time this was just think about land mines proposal a really it's it just means neck every one of the country doesn't have to fund other people's abortions occur it's on its proposal and these are very strongly pro-life members of congress that would be more if they have an opportunity and we hope that well astounding in feeling very encouraged about this issue martha aren't sandrine thank you very much for the same sort of thing
