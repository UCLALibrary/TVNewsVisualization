20110119150009.000|20110119150012.000|TR0|a.m. on the East Coast, 7:00 out West.  
20110119150012.000|20110119150014.000|TR0|I'm Fredricka Whitfield in for Kyra

20110119150019.000|20110119150022.000|TR0|Here are the stories that have us talking 
20110119150022.000|20110119150024.000|TR0|this morning.
20110119150024.000|20110119150027.000|TR0|
20110119150027.000|20110119150030.000|TR0|Check out this remarkable video out of 
20110119150030.000|20110119150032.000|TR0|Philadelphia, local station WCAU captured 
20110119150032.000|20110119150035.000|TR0|this raging fireball.  A gas main exploded 
20110119150035.000|20110119150037.000|TR0|killing one utilities worker and injuring 
20110119150037.000|20110119150040.000|TR0|five other people.
20110119150040.000|20110119150042.000|TR0|
20110119150042.000|20110119150045.000|TR0|And in Spokane, Washington, the FBI says a 
20110119150045.000|20110119150048.000|TR0|potentially deadly device was planted 
20110119150048.000|20110119150050.000|TR0|along a parade route celebrating Martin 
20110119150050.000|20110119150053.000|TR0|Luther King day on Monday.  An agent say 
20110119150053.000|20110119150055.000|TR0|the device was hidden inside this 
20110119150055.000|20110119150058.000|TR0|backpack, that you just saw along with 
20110119150058.000|20110119150100.000|TR0|with some t-shirts that you see right 
20110119150100.000|20110119150103.000|TR0|there.  They're showing the shirts in 
20110119150103.000|20110119150105.000|TR0|hopes that someone will recognize them.
20110119150105.000|20110119150108.000|TR0|
20110119150108.000|20110119150111.000|TR0|And on to Haiti now.  Charges are filed 
20110119150111.000|20110119150113.000|TR0|against the exiled dictator who returned  
20110119150113.000|20110119150116.000|TR0|home over the weekend.  Jean-Claude 
20110119150116.000|20110119150118.000|TR0|Duvalier, also known as "Baby Doc" has 
20110119150118.000|20110119150121.000|TR0|fled the country 25 years ago and has not 
20110119150121.000|20110119150123.000|TR0|revealed why he's back now.  Source in the 
20110119150123.000|20110119150126.000|TR0|country says the charges are related to 
20110119150126.000|20110119150129.000|TR0|financial corruption and may also include 
20110119150129.000|20110119150131.000|TR0|human rights violations.
20110119150131.000|20110119150134.000|TR0|
20110119150134.000|20110119150136.000|TR0|America and China now, it's among the most 
20110119150136.000|20110119150139.000|TR0|important relationships that we have with 
20110119150139.000|20110119150141.000|TR0|a foreign nation.  A rising superpower.  
20110119150141.000|20110119150144.000|TR0|And today, President Obama and  Chinese 
20110119150144.000|20110119150146.000|TR0|President Hu Jintao get down to business.  
20110119150146.000|20110119150149.000|TR0|The White House welcomed the  Chinese 
20110119150149.000|20110119150152.000|TR0|leader last hour.  You see him there 
20110119150152.000|20110119150154.000|TR0|meeting with Vice President Biden, Joe 
20110119150154.000|20110119150157.000|TR0|Biden, and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
20110119150157.000|20110119150159.000|TR0|Clinton there. And then now a bilateral 
20110119150159.000|20110119150202.000|TR0|meeting is getting under way.
20110119150202.000|20110119150204.000|TR0|
20110119150204.000|20110119150207.000|TR0|It is the first of several meetings on the 
20110119150207.000|20110119150210.000|TR0|calendar for today. And President Obama 
20110119150210.000|20110119150212.000|TR0|and President Hu will hold a joint news 
20110119150212.000|20110119150215.000|TR0|conference later on this  afternoon.  So 
20110119150215.000|20110119150217.000|TR0|there is a whole lot of ground in which to 
20110119150217.000|20110119150220.000|TR0|cover.  Money, trade, the military.  Human 
20110119150220.000|20110119150222.000|TR0|rights.
20110119150222.000|20110119150225.000|TR0|
20110119150225.000|20110119150227.000|TR0|Senior White House correspondent Ed Henry 
20110119150227.000|20110119150230.000|TR0|is joining us live. So, Ed, we understand 
20110119150230.000|20110119150233.000|TR0|that the two have been in the Oval Office. 
20110119150233.000|20110119150235.000|TR0| And they are in the White House now, soon 
20110119150235.000|20110119150238.000|TR0|to begin these bilateral discussions.  
20110119150238.000|20110119150240.000|TR0|What else would take place?
20110119150240.000|20110119150243.000|TR0|
20110119150243.000|20110119150245.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110119150245.000|20110119150248.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:   Yes, they've started the  
20110119150248.000|20110119150251.000|TR0|bilateral talks, and as you know it, Fred, 
20110119150251.000|20110119150253.000|TR0|they're in the Oval Office right now as we 
20110119150253.000|20110119150256.000|TR0|speak.  And it's interesting because there 
20110119150256.000|20110119150258.000|TR0|are these big substantive  issues.  But 
20110119150258.000|20110119150301.000|TR0|what do think they talked about first?  
20110119150301.000|20110119150303.000|TR0|What do two leaders do when they sit down? 
20110119150303.000|20110119150306.000|TR0| The weather, if you can believe it.
20110119150306.000|20110119150308.000|TR0|
20110119150308.000|20110119150311.000|TR0|One of my colleagues who just came out of 
20110119150311.000|20110119150314.000|TR0|the Oval Office and overheard President 
20110119150314.000|20110119150316.000|TR0|Obama explaining to President Hu that, 
20110119150316.000|20110119150319.000|TR0|yes, it's pretty normal to be this cold 
20110119150319.000|20110119150321.000|TR0|around January, pretty chilly in 
20110119150321.000|20110119150324.000|TR0|Washington right now.  So you can see that 
20110119150324.000|20110119150326.000|TR0|even these two powerful leaders, heading 
20110119150326.000|20110119150329.000|TR0|up these two big economic superpowers will 
20110119150329.000|20110119150332.000|TR0|even talk about mundane things like the 
20110119150332.000|20110119150334.000|TR0|weather.  But they're going to move 
20110119150334.000|20110119150337.000|TR0|quickly on, obviously, to trade.  To 
20110119150337.000|20110119150339.000|TR0|talking about trying to reform China's 
20110119150339.000|20110119150342.000|TR0|currency.  Also human rights.  And big 
20110119150342.000|20110119150344.000|TR0|security issues like North Korea.
20110119150344.000|20110119150347.000|TR0|
20110119150347.000|20110119150350.000|TR0|Now, we're told by senior U.S. officials 
20110119150350.000|20110119150352.000|TR0|that President Obama's tone in these 
20110119150352.000|20110119150355.000|TR0|private meetings like the one in the Oval 
20110119150355.000|20110119150357.000|TR0|Office right now is going to be firm,  
20110119150357.000|20110119150400.000|TR0|it's going to be direct, it's going to be 
20110119150400.000|20110119150402.000|TR0|tough in urging China to move forward on 
20110119150402.000|20110119150405.000|TR0|some reforms but that in public, of 
20110119150405.000|20110119150407.000|TR0|course, for diplomatic purposes, they're  
20110119150407.000|20110119150410.000|TR0|going to stress the positives a lot more.  
20110119150410.000|20110119150413.000|TR0|And that's exactly what we saw when 
20110119150413.000|20110119150415.000|TR0|President Hu arrived on the south lawn.  
20110119150415.000|20110119150418.000|TR0|Both leaders talking about where they 
20110119150418.000|20110119150420.000|TR0|agree.
20110119150420.000|20110119150423.000|TR0|

20110119150425.000|20110119150428.000|TR0|
20110119150428.000|20110119150431.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110119150431.000|20110119150433.000|TR0|STATES:  At the time when summed out the 
20110119150433.000|20110119150436.000|TR0|benefits of cooperation between the United 
20110119150436.000|20110119150438.000|TR0|States and China, this visit is also a 
20110119150438.000|20110119150441.000|TR0|chance to demonstrate.  We have an 
20110119150441.000|20110119150443.000|TR0|enormous stake in each other's success.  
20110119150443.000|20110119150446.000|TR0|In an interconnected world, in a global 
20110119150446.000|20110119150448.000|TR0|economy, nations, including our own, will 
20110119150448.000|20110119150451.000|TR0|be more prosperous and more secure when we 
20110119150451.000|20110119150454.000|TR0|work together.
20110119150454.000|20110119150456.000|TR0|
20110119150456.000|20110119150459.000|TR0|HU JINTAO, PRESIDENT OF CHINA (through 
20110119150459.000|20110119150501.000|TR0|translator):  Our participation as 
20110119150501.000|20110119150504.000|TR0|partners should be based on mutual 
20110119150504.000|20110119150506.000|TR0|benefit.  China's future and mutual 
20110119150506.000|20110119150509.000|TR0|destiny are tied to those of the world and 
20110119150509.000|20110119150512.000|TR0|China- U.S. relations have become closer.  
20110119150512.000|20110119150514.000|TR0|Our two countries should seek to learn 
20110119150514.000|20110119150517.000|TR0|from each other through exchanges and 
20110119150517.000|20110119150519.000|TR0|achieve win-win progress through 
20110119150519.000|20110119150522.000|TR0|cooperation.  This is the right approach 
20110119150522.000|20110119150524.000|TR0|for us to develop our relations.
20110119150524.000|20110119150527.000|TR0|
20110119150527.000|20110119150529.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110119150529.000|20110119150532.000|TR0|
20110119150532.000|20110119150535.000|TR0|HENRY:  Both sides, obviously, stressing 
20110119150535.000|20110119150537.000|TR0|cooperation.  And a nice handshake after 
20110119150537.000|20110119150540.000|TR0|that when they went into the Oval Office 
20110119150540.000|20110119150542.000|TR0|where the bilateral talks are under way 
20110119150542.000|20110119150545.000|TR0|right now.  But important to know, the 
20110119150545.000|20110119150547.000|TR0|president, President Obama also noting at 
20110119150547.000|20110119150550.000|TR0|one point that the rights of all people 
20110119150550.000|20110119150553.000|TR0|need to be respected, perhaps a gentle way 
20110119150553.000|20110119150555.000|TR0|of mentioning human rights.  Just to my 
20110119150555.000|20110119150558.000|TR0|right, there's - and  you can see the 
20110119150558.000|20110119150600.000|TR0|handshake there.  But just outside the 
20110119150600.000|20110119150603.000|TR0|White House, (INAUDIBLE) a flavor of 
20110119150603.000|20110119150605.000|TR0|what's going on there.  A lot of 
20110119150605.000|20110119150608.000|TR0|protesters shouting about Tibet.  Free 
20110119150608.000|20110119150610.000|TR0|Tibet, trying to send a message to 
20110119150610.000|20110119150613.000|TR0|President Hu.  You may hear a little bit 
20110119150613.000|20110119150616.000|TR0|of that.
20110119150616.000|20110119150618.000|TR0|
20110119150618.000|20110119150621.000|TR0|We've got pictures of them as well.  So 
20110119150621.000|20110119150623.000|TR0|all of this playing out as these two 
20110119150623.000|20110119150626.000|TR0|leaders sit down in the Oval Office.  Also 
20110119150626.000|20110119150628.000|TR0|behind me, it's probably hard to see the 
20110119150628.000|20110119150631.000|TR0|white on white but there's some 
20110119150631.000|20110119150634.000|TR0|scaffolding back there.  That's the north 
20110119150634.000|20110119150636.000|TR0|portico, that is where President Hu will 
20110119150636.000|20110119150639.000|TR0|be arriving later for the state  dinner.  
20110119150639.000|20110119150641.000|TR0|Fred?
20110119150641.000|20110119150644.000|TR0|
20110119150644.000|20110119150646.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  Thanks so much.  
20110119150646.000|20110119150649.000|TR0|Ed Henry, appreciate that.  That's what's 
20110119150649.000|20110119150652.000|TR0|taking place across the street.  Whereas 
20110119150652.000|20110119150654.000|TR0|on the right hand side of the  screen, 
20110119150654.000|20110119150657.000|TR0|you're seeing there the meeting between 
20110119150657.000|20110119150659.000|TR0|President Hu and President Obama in the 
20110119150659.000|20110119150702.000|TR0|Oval Office there, chatting up a little 
20110119150702.000|20110119150704.000|TR0|bit, and then also doing the handshaking 
20110119150704.000|20110119150707.000|TR0|there, a view of the photographers there 
20110119150707.000|20110119150709.000|TR0|as well.
20110119150709.000|20110119150712.000|TR0|
20110119150712.000|20110119150715.000|TR0|So, this is it.  After months of wrangling 
20110119150715.000|20110119150717.000|TR0|and weeks of debate now, we're leaving the 
20110119150717.000|20110119150720.000|TR0|scene of China and the U.S..  Now, we're 
20110119150720.000|20110119150722.000|TR0|talking about what's happening on Capitol 
20110119150722.000|20110119150725.000|TR0|Hill.
20110119150725.000|20110119150727.000|TR0|
20110119150727.000|20110119150730.000|TR0|Lawmakers in the House, in particular, 
20110119150730.000|20110119150733.000|TR0|will vote today on repealing the new 
20110119150733.000|20110119150735.000|TR0|health care reforms.  Right now, live 
20110119150735.000|20110119150738.000|TR0|pictures, the House is getting ready to 
20110119150738.000|20110119150740.000|TR0|enter its final stage of debate.  The vote 
20110119150740.000|20110119150743.000|TR0|is expected later on this afternoon.  And 
20110119150743.000|20110119150745.000|TR0|Republicans almost certainly say they have 
20110119150745.000|20110119150748.000|TR0|the votes to back the repeal.

20110119150756.000|20110119150758.000|TR0|REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK:  I rise today 
20110119150758.000|20110119150801.000|TR0|in support of the repeal of the job 
20110119150801.000|20110119150803.000|TR0|killing Obamacare legislation.  This bill 
20110119150803.000|20110119150806.000|TR0|is a whopping 2,500 pages of monstrosity 
20110119150806.000|20110119150808.000|TR0|of new spending and government 
20110119150808.000|20110119150811.000|TR0|bureaucracy.  Rush to approval after only 
20110119150811.000|20110119150814.000|TR0|48 hours of arm-twisting and deal-making.
20110119150814.000|20110119150816.000|TR0|
20110119150816.000|20110119150819.000|TR0|REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ (D), 
20110119150819.000|20110119150821.000|TR0|FLORIDA:  And I challenge our colleagues 
20110119150821.000|20110119150824.000|TR0|on the other side of the aisle, on the 
20110119150824.000|20110119150826.000|TR0|Republican side of the aisle, who are  
20110119150826.000|20110119150829.000|TR0|vociferously advocating the repeal of 
20110119150829.000|20110119150831.000|TR0|healthcare reform on the premise that it's 
20110119150831.000|20110119150834.000|TR0|a job-killer, to name one area of 
20110119150834.000|20110119150837.000|TR0|healthcare, one, where there have been job 
20110119150837.000|20110119150839.000|TR0|losses.  I would suspect that we would 
20110119150839.000|20110119150842.000|TR0|hear crickets chirping because there are 
20110119150842.000|20110119150844.000|TR0|none.

20110119150849.000|20110119150852.000|TR0|
20110119150852.000|20110119150855.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  That was earlier.  
20110119150855.000|20110119150857.000|TR0|That's what's taking place right now.  
20110119150857.000|20110119150900.000|TR0|Majority leader Eric Cantor of Virginia 
20110119150900.000|20110119150902.000|TR0|speaking just after we heard a few words 
20110119150902.000|20110119150905.000|TR0|from House Speaker John Boehner. Let's 
20110119150905.000|20110119150907.000|TR0|listen in to Mr. Cantor.
20110119150907.000|20110119150910.000|TR0|
20110119150910.000|20110119150912.000|TR0|REP. ERIC CANTOR (R), HOUSE MAJORITY 
20110119150912.000|20110119150915.000|TR0|LEADER:  ... this is the first step 
20110119150915.000|20110119150918.000|TR0|towards achieving that.  As the Speaker 
20110119150918.000|20110119150920.000|TR0|said, we also believe that this bill is 
20110119150920.000|20110119150923.000|TR0|detrimental to job creation in this 
20110119150923.000|20110119150925.000|TR0|country. We believe it's bad for the  
20110119150925.000|20110119150928.000|TR0|economy.  And we are going to begin to 
20110119150928.000|20110119150930.000|TR0|deliver on posing an alternative and 
20110119150930.000|20110119150933.000|TR0|better way for the American people.
20110119150933.000|20110119150936.000|TR0|
20110119150936.000|20110119150938.000|TR0|We've also said that we are going to be a 
20110119150938.000|20110119150941.000|TR0|results-driven Congress.  So I've got a 
20110119150941.000|20110119150943.000|TR0|problem with the assumption here that 
20110119150943.000|20110119150946.000|TR0|somehow the Senate can be a place for  
20110119150946.000|20110119150948.000|TR0|legislation to go into a cul-de-sac or 
20110119150948.000|20110119150951.000|TR0|dead-end.  And leader Reed continues to 
20110119150951.000|20110119150954.000|TR0|say that he is not going to bring this up 
20110119150954.000|20110119150956.000|TR0|for a vote in the Senate.  The American 
20110119150956.000|20110119150959.000|TR0|people deserve a full hearing.  They 
20110119150959.000|20110119151001.000|TR0|deserve to see this legislation go to the 
20110119151001.000|20110119151004.000|TR0|Senate for a full vote.  Interestingly, 
20110119151004.000|20110119151006.000|TR0|Senator Schumer says that this is a 
20110119151006.000|20110119151009.000|TR0|political win for the Democrats.  If so, 
20110119151009.000|20110119151011.000|TR0|let's see the votes.
20110119151011.000|20110119151014.000|TR0|
20110119151014.000|20110119151017.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As the Speaker and 
20110119151017.000|20110119151019.000|TR0|leader said today, we'll have our vote.  
20110119151019.000|20110119151022.000|TR0|The speaker asked last year -
20110119151022.000|20110119151024.000|TR0|
20110119151024.000|20110119151027.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  You're listening 
20110119151027.000|20110119151029.000|TR0|to the Republican commitment to have a 
20110119151029.000|20110119151032.000|TR0|vote on repealing health care reform.  
20110119151032.000|20110119151035.000|TR0|That vote likely to take place later on 
20110119151035.000|20110119151037.000|TR0|this afternoon in the House.  But you 
20110119151037.000|20110119151040.000|TR0|heard Mr. Cantor talking about how in the 
20110119151040.000|20110119151042.000|TR0|Senate, it is not likely to have any 
20110119151042.000|20110119151045.000|TR0|success, the kind of success that Boehner 
20110119151045.000|20110119151047.000|TR0|and Cantor are hoping for in the House.  
20110119151047.000|20110119151050.000|TR0|We'll keep you posted on the efforts to 
20110119151050.000|20110119151052.000|TR0|repeal health care reform in the House 
20110119151052.000|20110119151055.000|TR0|today.
20110119151055.000|20110119151058.000|TR0|
20110119151058.000|20110119151100.000|TR0|In the meantime, let's talk about some 
20110119151100.000|20110119151103.000|TR0|nasty weather in some parts.  This is a 
20110119151103.000|20110119151105.000|TR0|picture of misery in parts of Washington 
20110119151105.000|20110119151108.000|TR0|state.  The problem, mud slides.  A 
20110119151108.000|20110119151110.000|TR0|highway worker said it looks like a bomb 
20110119151110.000|20110119151113.000|TR0|went off, seeing all those big trees 
20110119151113.000|20110119151116.000|TR0|littering highways.  As much as six to 10 
20110119151116.000|20110119151118.000|TR0|inches of rain in less than a day  
20110119151118.000|20110119151121.000|TR0|triggered those mudslides. Jacqui Jeras 
20110119151121.000|20110119151123.000|TR0|now in the weather center.  Oh, my gosh, 
20110119151123.000|20110119151126.000|TR0|to see that kind of timber come rolling 
20110119151126.000|20110119151128.000|TR0|down the hill, that is frightening.
20110119151128.000|20110119151131.000|TR0|
20110119151131.000|20110119151133.000|TR0|JACQUI JERAS, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  It is, 
20110119151133.000|20110119151136.000|TR0|it's a scary thing. They didn't get a lot 
20110119151136.000|20110119151139.000|TR0|of that rain yesterday.  And pretty much 
20110119151139.000|20110119151141.000|TR0|no rain is expected across the northwest 
20110119151141.000|20110119151144.000|TR0|today.  That's the good news.  But the bad 
20110119151144.000|20110119151146.000|TR0|news is that the soil is still very, very 
20110119151146.000|20110119151149.000|TR0|saturated.  So it remains an unstable 
20110119151149.000|20110119151151.000|TR0|situation.  So we've got, you know, what's 
20110119151151.000|20110119151154.000|TR0|been just a promenade of storms coming in 
20110119151154.000|20110119151157.000|TR0|the Pacific northwest and they've been 
20110119151157.000|20110119151159.000|TR0|making their way across the country.  The 
20110119151159.000|20110119151202.000|TR0|last storm in the Pacific northwest is now 
20110119151202.000|20110119151204.000|TR0|moving through the Rockies and starting to 
20110119151204.000|20110119151207.000|TR0|throw some moisture in parts of the plain 
20110119151207.000|20110119151209.000|TR0|states.
20110119151209.000|20110119151212.000|TR0|
20110119151212.000|20110119151214.000|TR0|So we're looking at some wintry weather 
20110119151214.000|20110119151217.000|TR0|moving in at this hour across the Rocky  
20110119151217.000|20110119151220.000|TR0|Mountains, into western Colorado, we've 
20110119151220.000|20110119151222.000|TR0|got some snow coming down around  
20110119151222.000|20110119151225.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) Nebraska, and a little 
20110119151225.000|20110119151227.000|TR0|freezing rain, a bit of a concern in 
20110119151227.000|20110119151230.000|TR0|Wichita and into parts of Oklahoma.  But 
20110119151230.000|20110119151232.000|TR0|that's very, very light.  Winter storm 
20110119151232.000|20110119151235.000|TR0|advisories are in effect, as well as 
20110119151235.000|20110119151238.000|TR0|watches as the system will start to spread 
20110119151238.000|20110119151240.000|TR0| all the way into the Ohio Valley into 
20110119151240.000|20110119151243.000|TR0|later tonight into some places that 
20110119151243.000|20110119151245.000|TR0|haven't seen a lot of snow, as of late.  
20110119151245.000|20110119151248.000|TR0|They're going to get a couple inches.  You 
20110119151248.000|20110119151250.000|TR0|know, it's not a monster storm of the 
20110119151250.000|20110119151253.000|TR0|century, for example.
20110119151253.000|20110119151256.000|TR0|
20110119151256.000|20110119151258.000|TR0|We don't think you'll get a foot out of 
20110119151258.000|20110119151301.000|TR0|this.  But Kansas City, it's been a while 
20110119151301.000|20110119151303.000|TR0|since you've seen five to nine inches of 
20110119151303.000|20110119151306.000|TR0|snowfall. So that's going to be pretty 
20110119151306.000|20110119151308.000|TR0|heavy for you and then we're looking at 
20110119151308.000|20110119151311.000|TR0|maybe four to six, north of St. Louis, 
20110119151311.000|20110119151313.000|TR0|Indianapolis maybe four to five inches 
20110119151313.000|20110119151316.000|TR0|expected around there.  That's going to 
20110119151316.000|20110119151319.000|TR0|head over into the Cincinnati area as 
20110119151319.000|20110119151321.000|TR0|well.  And then eventually, likely turn 
20110119151321.000|20110119151324.000|TR0|into a northern eastern storm.  Yes, the 
20110119151324.000|20110119151326.000|TR0|heads-up on that one for you probably come 
20110119151326.000|20110119151329.000|TR0|Friday.

20110119151331.000|20110119151334.000|TR0|With this Arctic air that's building in 
20110119151334.000|20110119151337.000|TR0|across the upper midwest and these are the 
20110119151337.000|20110119151339.000|TR0|temperatures that you're going to be 
20110119151339.000|20110119151342.000|TR0|waking up to tomorrow morning.  Look at 
20110119151342.000|20110119151344.000|TR0|that, 14 degrees below zero in Fargo.  14, 
20110119151344.000|20110119151347.000|TR0|maybe they could handle that.  But you add 
20110119151347.000|20110119151349.000|TR0|in the winds, we're talking 20s and 30s

20110119151400.000|20110119151402.000|TR0|JERAS:  It's going to be pretty ugly there 
20110119151402.000|20110119151405.000|TR0|tomorrow morning.
20110119151405.000|20110119151407.000|TR0|
20110119151407.000|20110119151410.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  I don't know how folks do it 
20110119151410.000|20110119151412.000|TR0|but they are hearty in that part of the 
20110119151412.000|20110119151415.000|TR0|country.
20110119151415.000|20110119151418.000|TR0|
20110119151418.000|20110119151420.000|TR0|JERAS:  It's like 100 degrees in the 
20110119151420.000|20110119151423.000|TR0|summer, what's the difference?  You're not 
20110119151423.000|20110119151425.000|TR0|going outside the other way.
20110119151425.000|20110119151428.000|TR0|
20110119151428.000|20110119151430.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  I don't mind 100 degrees.
20110119151430.000|20110119151433.000|TR0|
20110119151433.000|20110119151435.000|TR0|JERAS:  Really?  (INAUDIBLE)

20110119151438.000|20110119151441.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  It doesn't make a big 
20110119151441.000|20110119151443.000|TR0|difference for me.
20110119151443.000|20110119151446.000|TR0|
20110119151446.000|20110119151448.000|TR0|Thank you, Jacqui.  Appreciate it.

20110119151451.000|20110119151453.000|TR0|Take a look at this.  Who is that man

20110119151456.000|20110119151459.000|TR0|Marciano.  And I want to explain, what is 
20110119151459.000|20110119151501.000|TR0|he doing in Colorado?  Have you even seen 
20110119151501.000|20110119151504.000|TR0|that kind of sport?  It's kind of the

20110119151527.000|20110119151529.000|TR0|Travolta talking about scientology,

20110119151542.000|20110119151545.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  Also part of the 
20110119151545.000|20110119151547.000|TR0|prime time line-up, "American Idol" is 
20110119151547.000|20110119151550.000|TR0|back.  But the judges' bench looks a lot 
20110119151550.000|20110119151552.000|TR0|different this time around.  "Showbiz 
20110119151552.000|20110119151555.000|TR0|Tonight" host A.J. Hammer is live in New 
20110119151555.000|20110119151558.000|TR0|York.  A.J., it's hard to think of  "Idol" 
20110119151558.000|20110119151600.000|TR0|without Simon Cowell, but we must.
20110119151600.000|20110119151603.000|TR0|
20110119151603.000|20110119151605.000|TR0|A.J. HAMMER, HOST "SHOWBIZ TONIGHT":  Yes, 
20110119151605.000|20110119151608.000|TR0|Fred, for so many people, love him or hate 
20110119151608.000|20110119151610.000|TR0|the guy, he really was the show.  So it's 
20110119151610.000|20110119151613.000|TR0|going to be very interesting to see 
20110119151613.000|20110119151615.000|TR0|exactly how "Idol" plays out now after all 
20110119151615.000|20110119151618.000|TR0|the buildup last year.  There's been so 
20110119151618.000|20110119151621.000|TR0|much speculation about it ever since last 
20110119151621.000|20110119151623.000|TR0|season wrapped up in May.

20110119151626.000|20110119151628.000|TR0|Finally, the new season fires up tonight.  
20110119151628.000|20110119151631.000|TR0|In case you've somehow missed it, new  
20110119151631.000|20110119151633.000|TR0|judges, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler 
20110119151633.000|20110119151636.000|TR0|will join the last original judge Randy 
20110119151636.000|20110119151639.000|TR0|Jackson right there on the "Idol" panel. 
20110119151639.000|20110119151641.000|TR0|Nigel Lythgoe is the show's executive  
20110119151641.000|20110119151644.000|TR0|producer.  And "Showbiz Tonight" just 
20110119151644.000|20110119151646.000|TR0|caught up with him to get inside scoop on  
20110119151646.000|20110119151649.000|TR0|Steven Tyler's judging approach and to 
20110119151649.000|20110119151651.000|TR0|find out if J. Lo is indeed the new big 
20110119151651.000|20110119151654.000|TR0|diva in town.  Watch what he told us.

20110119151702.000|20110119151704.000|TR0|Seacrest is much more of a diva than 
20110119151704.000|20110119151707.000|TR0|Jennifer Lopez.  And even if you can't 
20110119151707.000|20110119151709.000|TR0|sing, Steven will say, I hear your spirit 
20110119151709.000|20110119151712.000|TR0|singing to me but don't give up your day 
20110119151712.000|20110119151714.000|TR0|job.  You know, it's very pleasantly done.

20110119151722.000|20110119151725.000|TR0|HAMMER:  Yes, that's the kind of guy Tyler 
20110119151725.000|20110119151727.000|TR0|is.  It doesn't sound like he's going to 
20110119151727.000|20110119151730.000|TR0|be filling brutally honestly, mean guy 
20110119151730.000|20110119151732.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) Cowell.  "Idol" was still a 
20110119151732.000|20110119151735.000|TR0|ratings juggernaut last season.  But 
20110119151735.000|20110119151737.000|TR0|viewership did continue to drop off  some. 
20110119151737.000|20110119151740.000|TR0| Still, Fred, there are a lot of very 
20110119151740.000|20110119151743.000|TR0|excited fans, very eager to see exactly 
20110119151743.000|20110119151745.000|TR0|how this new formula is going to work out. 
20110119151745.000|20110119151748.000|TR0| You know we'll be watching.
20110119151748.000|20110119151750.000|TR0|
20110119151750.000|20110119151753.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Of course, you are watching 
20110119151753.000|20110119151755.000|TR0|other things, too, such as the birth of a 
20110119151755.000|20110119151758.000|TR0|new son by John Travolta and Kelly 
20110119151758.000|20110119151801.000|TR0|Preston.  And they're now talking, they're 
20110119151801.000|20110119151803.000|TR0|breaking their silence about this silent 
20110119151803.000|20110119151806.000|TR0|birth.
20110119151806.000|20110119151808.000|TR0|
20110119151808.000|20110119151811.000|TR0|HAMMER:  Yes, there have been a lot of 
20110119151811.000|20110119151813.000|TR0|questions about this.  And Preston just 
20110119151813.000|20110119151816.000|TR0|appeared on the "Today" show this morning 
20110119151816.000|20110119151818.000|TR0|to talk about their new baby and she  
20110119151818.000|20110119151821.000|TR0|explained that she and John, who are 
20110119151821.000|20110119151824.000|TR0|scientologists went through what's called 
20110119151824.000|20110119151826.000|TR0|a silent birth.  Take a look at this.

20110119151834.000|20110119151836.000|TR0|KELLY PRESTON, ACTRESS:  A silent birth is 
20110119151836.000|20110119151839.000|TR0|basically just no words as much as 
20110119151839.000|20110119151842.000|TR0|possible.  If you need to moan or if you 
20110119151842.000|20110119151844.000|TR0|cry out or you know, all of that, of  
20110119151844.000|20110119151847.000|TR0|course, that's normal.  But just bringing 
20110119151847.000|20110119151849.000|TR0|them in as peaceful and gentle a way as 
20110119151849.000|20110119151852.000|TR0|possible.

20110119151900.000|20110119151902.000|TR0|HAMMER:  It's a different approach than a 
20110119151902.000|20110119151905.000|TR0|lot of people take. But Preston says after 
20110119151905.000|20110119151907.000|TR0|giving birth three times, she believes 
20110119151907.000|20110119151910.000|TR0|silent birth helped her to have, "calm and 
20110119151910.000|20110119151912.000|TR0|peaceful kids."  In the interview, she 
20110119151912.000|20110119151915.000|TR0|also talked about how her family's got an 
20110119151915.000|20110119151917.000|TR0|outpouring of support from so many people, 
20110119151917.000|20110119151920.000|TR0|Preston and Travolta's oldest son, Jett, 
20110119151920.000|20110119151923.000|TR0|died of a seizure, 16 years old, two years 
20110119151923.000|20110119151925.000|TR0|ago.  Preston says that while she still 
20110119151925.000|20110119151928.000|TR0|thinks of Jett every day, all of this 
20110119151928.000|20110119151930.000|TR0|support and this new baby, of course, 
20110119151930.000|20110119151933.000|TR0|Fred, has been, as she put it, 
20110119151933.000|20110119151935.000|TR0|"wonderfully  healing."  So that's good to 
20110119151935.000|20110119151938.000|TR0|hear.
20110119151938.000|20110119151941.000|TR0|
20110119151941.000|20110119151943.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Congratulations to them on 
20110119151943.000|20110119151946.000|TR0|their new bundle of joy.
20110119151946.000|20110119151948.000|TR0|
20110119151948.000|20110119151951.000|TR0|And then, let's talk about somebody who 
20110119151951.000|20110119151953.000|TR0|was known for her great hairdo and now 
20110119151953.000|20110119151956.000|TR0|come to find out why Jennifer Aniston says 
20110119151956.000|20110119151958.000|TR0|she hated it.  Why is she talking about 
20110119151958.000|20110119152001.000|TR0|the "Rachel" hair?
20110119152001.000|20110119152004.000|TR0|
20110119152004.000|20110119152006.000|TR0|HAMMER:  I think there are a lot of women 
20110119152006.000|20110119152009.000|TR0|freaking out about it. This has a lot of 
20110119152009.000|20110119152011.000|TR0|women talking and buzzing.  Because well, 
20110119152011.000|20110119152014.000|TR0|Aniston says she hated the haircut and 
20110119152014.000|20110119152016.000|TR0|this was the haircut that helped make her 
20110119152016.000|20110119152019.000|TR0|famous.  You may remember this do from its 
20110119152019.000|20110119152022.000|TR0|"Friends" heyday.  But right there on the 
20110119152022.000|20110119152024.000|TR0|February issue of "Allure" magazine, 
20110119152024.000|20110119152027.000|TR0|Aniston said the haircut was not her best 
20110119152027.000|20110119152029.000|TR0|look.  And it was as she put it "the 
20110119152029.000|20110119152032.000|TR0|ugliest haircut I've ever seen."  There 
20110119152032.000|20110119152034.000|TR0|were a lot of women who went out and 
20110119152034.000|20110119152037.000|TR0|modeled their hair.  Yes, they ran out.  
20110119152037.000|20110119152039.000|TR0|They got the hairstyle that she had after 
20110119152039.000|20110119152042.000|TR0|that character.  So I think they might 
20110119152042.000|20110119152045.000|TR0|disagree with that.  Fred, did you give in 
20110119152045.000|20110119152047.000|TR0|to the Jen haircut?
20110119152047.000|20110119152050.000|TR0|
20110119152050.000|20110119152052.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110119152052.000|20110119152055.000|TR0|
20110119152055.000|20110119152057.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  No, I didn't have it but I 
20110119152057.000|20110119152100.000|TR0|liked the haircut.  Hey, who cares about 
20110119152100.000|20110119152103.000|TR0|what I have to say.  But I kind of thought 
20110119152103.000|20110119152105.000|TR0|that was one of her best looks.  I mean, 
20110119152105.000|20110119152108.000|TR0|she always looks good.  But that was kind 
20110119152108.000|20110119152110.000|TR0|of a signature, put her on the map look?
20110119152110.000|20110119152113.000|TR0|
20110119152113.000|20110119152115.000|TR0|HAMMER:  Yes, I guess, it was really more 
20110119152115.000|20110119152118.000|TR0|her character's and she hated it.  
20110119152118.000|20110119152120.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE)  who knows.
20110119152120.000|20110119152123.000|TR0|
20110119152123.000|20110119152126.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Oh well.  Not surprising.  All 
20110119152126.000|20110119152128.000|TR0|right.  A.J. Hammer, thanks so much.   
20110119152128.000|20110119152131.000|TR0|Appreciate that.  See you.
20110119152131.000|20110119152133.000|TR0|
20110119152133.000|20110119152136.000|TR0|All right.  Well perhaps you want more

20110119152212.000|20110119152214.000|TR0|
20110119152214.000|20110119152217.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:           We're getting more 
20110119152217.000|20110119152219.000|TR0|information about a videotape that may 
20110119152219.000|20110119152222.000|TR0|show exactly what happened on the day of 
20110119152222.000|20110119152225.000|TR0|those tragic shootings in Tucson.  Joining 
20110119152225.000|20110119152227.000|TR0|me now is Richard Kastigar, Pima County 
20110119152227.000|20110119152230.000|TR0|sheriff and chief of investigators.  So 
20110119152230.000|20110119152232.000|TR0|Richard, I understand there's this 
20110119152232.000|20110119152235.000|TR0|surveillance tape, how was it acquired and 
20110119152235.000|20110119152237.000|TR0|what does it tell you about the scene of 
20110119152237.000|20110119152240.000|TR0|the crime?
20110119152240.000|20110119152243.000|TR0|
20110119152243.000|20110119152245.000|TR0|RICHARD KASTIGAR, PIMA COUNTY SHERIFF'S 
20110119152245.000|20110119152248.000|TR0|DEPT. (on the phone): Fredricka, good 
20110119152248.000|20110119152250.000|TR0|morning.  There are a number of tapes but 
20110119152250.000|20110119152253.000|TR0|I think this information has been out 
20110119152253.000|20110119152255.000|TR0|there for some time.  But Safeway did have 
20110119152255.000|20110119152258.000|TR0|surveillance cameras both within and 
20110119152258.000|20110119152300.000|TR0|outside of the  store.  I viewed the tape 
20110119152300.000|20110119152303.000|TR0|the day of the incident.  And those 
20110119152303.000|20110119152306.000|TR0|computer hard drives with the tapes on 
20110119152306.000|20110119152308.000|TR0|them have been turned over to the FBI.  
20110119152308.000|20110119152311.000|TR0|But, and quite honestly, we did not 
20110119152311.000|20110119152313.000|TR0|disclose the information on these tapes 
20110119152313.000|20110119152316.000|TR0|for a variety of  reasons, most 
20110119152316.000|20110119152318.000|TR0|importantly, to protect the family.  From, 
20110119152318.000|20110119152321.000|TR0|really, the graphic detail that exists on 
20110119152321.000|20110119152324.000|TR0|those.  However, this information is out 
20110119152324.000|20110119152326.000|TR0|there.  And I have been discussing it.  So 
20110119152326.000|20110119152329.000|TR0|I can tell you what I've seen, if you wish.
20110119152329.000|20110119152331.000|TR0|
20110119152331.000|20110119152334.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Well, tell me what you've seen.
20110119152334.000|20110119152336.000|TR0|
20110119152336.000|20110119152339.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well, one portion of the tape, 
20110119152339.000|20110119152341.000|TR0|and please understand, there are  really 
20110119152341.000|20110119152344.000|TR0|dozens of different perspectives from 
20110119152344.000|20110119152347.000|TR0|different cameras with different time 
20110119152347.000|20110119152349.000|TR0|lines in seeing our suspect, Jared, in and 
20110119152349.000|20110119152352.000|TR0|around the Safeway.  But there's a portion 
20110119152352.000|20110119152354.000|TR0|of the tape where you can see very 
20110119152354.000|20110119152357.000|TR0|clearly, that Jared, the suspect comes out 
20110119152357.000|20110119152359.000|TR0|on one of the doors, he walks around a 
20110119152359.000|20110119152402.000|TR0|table, a collapsible perhaps a six-foot 
20110119152402.000|20110119152405.000|TR0|table, and when he does so with very 
20110119152405.000|20110119152407.000|TR0|significant purpose.
20110119152407.000|20110119152410.000|TR0|
20110119152410.000|20110119152412.000|TR0|He walks up to the congresswoman, points a 
20110119152412.000|20110119152415.000|TR0|gun at her face and shoots.  She is barely 
20110119152415.000|20110119152417.000|TR0|in the frame of that video.  The suspect 
20110119152417.000|20110119152420.000|TR0|then turns to his left and actually kind 
20110119152420.000|20110119152422.000|TR0|of walks out of the perspective or the 
20110119152422.000|20110119152425.000|TR0|video itself.  And we know, from talking 
20110119152425.000|20110119152428.000|TR0|to witnesses, and others in and around 
20110119152428.000|20110119152430.000|TR0|that chaotic scene, that he fired 
20110119152430.000|20110119152433.000|TR0|indiscriminately from that point forward 
20110119152433.000|20110119152435.000|TR0|at people that were seated in chairs.
20110119152435.000|20110119152438.000|TR0|
20110119152438.000|20110119152440.000|TR0|This would have been to the 
20110119152440.000|20110119152443.000|TR0|congresswoman's right.  He then turns back 
20110119152443.000|20110119152446.000|TR0|to his right, and engages the aide for the 
20110119152446.000|20110119152448.000|TR0|congresswoman, Mr. Barber, you can see 
20110119152448.000|20110119152451.000|TR0|that he is shot up and around the face and 
20110119152451.000|20110119152453.000|TR0|neck area.  At that very moment, as Mr.  
20110119152453.000|20110119152456.000|TR0|Barber is attempting to go to the ground 
20110119152456.000|20110119152458.000|TR0|perhaps as a result of the injury, or 
20110119152458.000|20110119152501.000|TR0|perhaps to flee.  You can see the judge, 
20110119152501.000|20110119152503.000|TR0|Judge Roll, very purposefully put his  
20110119152503.000|20110119152506.000|TR0|arms over on Mr. Barber, pushed him down, 
20110119152506.000|20110119152509.000|TR0|in an attempt to have him crawl under  the 
20110119152509.000|20110119152511.000|TR0|table but actually is an obstruction from 
20110119152511.000|20110119152514.000|TR0|the two of them for escaping that rests 
20110119152514.000|20110119152516.000|TR0|behind them.
20110119152516.000|20110119152519.000|TR0|
20110119152519.000|20110119152521.000|TR0|And it's my estimation that the judge 
20110119152521.000|20110119152524.000|TR0|really, I think, offers himself, or helps 
20110119152524.000|20110119152527.000|TR0|a friend or a colleague by pushing him 
20110119152527.000|20110119152529.000|TR0|under the table, in doing so, he exposes 
20110119152529.000|20110119152532.000|TR0|his back to the shooter.  The shooter then 
20110119152532.000|20110119152534.000|TR0|does shoot him in the back.  And you can 
20110119152534.000|20110119152537.000|TR0|see before the tape finishes that they're 
20110119152537.000|20110119152539.000|TR0|starting to really retreat from the 
20110119152539.000|20110119152542.000|TR0|opposite side of the table.  And that's 
20110119152542.000|20110119152545.000|TR0|pretty much the extent of the video that I 
20110119152545.000|20110119152547.000|TR0|watched.
20110119152547.000|20110119152550.000|TR0|
20110119152550.000|20110119152552.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  So, it certainly tells you a 
20110119152552.000|20110119152555.000|TR0|lot about the instincts of the victims in 
20110119152555.000|20110119152557.000|TR0|those final moments.  And, so, based on 
20110119152557.000|20110119152600.000|TR0|what you envisioned when looking at the 
20110119152600.000|20110119152602.000|TR0|crime scene, just moments after it 
20110119152602.000|20110119152605.000|TR0|happened, how does that compare to what 
20110119152605.000|20110119152608.000|TR0|you ended up seeing, right there on 
20110119152608.000|20110119152610.000|TR0|videotape?  Did it alter your 
20110119152610.000|20110119152613.000|TR0|understanding  in a very profound way?
20110119152613.000|20110119152615.000|TR0|
20110119152615.000|20110119152618.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well, you know, in law 
20110119152618.000|20110119152620.000|TR0|enforcement, we have somewhat of a sterile 
20110119152620.000|20110119152623.000|TR0|view of crime scenes.  And as much as this 
20110119152623.000|20110119152626.000|TR0|has affected me personally, I have  to 
20110119152626.000|20110119152628.000|TR0|detach my personal feelings from this 
20110119152628.000|20110119152631.000|TR0|investigation.  Having said that, it gave 
20110119152631.000|20110119152633.000|TR0|me a perspective to substantiate what we 
20110119152633.000|20110119152636.000|TR0|were being told.  There were dozens of 
20110119152636.000|20110119152638.000|TR0|folks at that chaotic scene who each had 
20110119152638.000|20110119152641.000|TR0|their own perspective.  Some were injured. 
20110119152641.000|20110119152643.000|TR0| Some were wounded.  Some watched what 
20110119152643.000|20110119152646.000|TR0|transpired.
20110119152646.000|20110119152649.000|TR0|
20110119152649.000|20110119152651.000|TR0|And when we were talking to all of these 
20110119152651.000|20110119152654.000|TR0|folks, it was really unclear to try to 
20110119152654.000|20110119152656.000|TR0|piece this together what took place.  And 
20110119152656.000|20110119152659.000|TR0|when I watched the video, it helped me 
20110119152659.000|20110119152701.000|TR0|understand very clearly the purpose and 
20110119152701.000|20110119152704.000|TR0|the focus that I believe the suspect had.  
20110119152704.000|20110119152707.000|TR0|I was concerned about what his objective 
20110119152707.000|20110119152709.000|TR0|was.  And was very clear to me that he 
20110119152709.000|20110119152712.000|TR0|walked up and fired the first round right 
20110119152712.000|20110119152714.000|TR0|at Congresswoman Giffords.  He then, of 
20110119152714.000|20110119152717.000|TR0|course, as I mentioned, turned to his 
20110119152717.000|20110119152719.000|TR0|left, came back to his right, subsequently 
20110119152719.000|20110119152722.000|TR0|killing the judge.
20110119152722.000|20110119152724.000|TR0|
20110119152724.000|20110119152727.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  And what more did this tape 
20110119152727.000|20110119152730.000|TR0|reveal to you about Jared Loughner, the 
20110119152730.000|20110119152732.000|TR0|suspect himself?  Was he wearing ear 
20110119152732.000|20110119152735.000|TR0|plugs?  That was something that's been  
20110119152735.000|20110119152737.000|TR0|reported.  And how close was he to 
20110119152737.000|20110119152740.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords when he fired the 
20110119152740.000|20110119152742.000|TR0|shot?
20110119152742.000|20110119152745.000|TR0|
20110119152745.000|20110119152748.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Well, we know he was wearing 
20110119152748.000|20110119152750.000|TR0|ear plugs, because when he was arrested, 
20110119152750.000|20110119152753.000|TR0|the ear plugs were removed.  And that 
20110119152753.000|20110119152755.000|TR0|suggests perhaps, in my mind, some 
20110119152755.000|20110119152758.000|TR0|understanding of what he was about to do. 
20110119152758.000|20110119152800.000|TR0|Actually, he was in the Safeway.  There 
20110119152800.000|20110119152803.000|TR0|was even a video of him talking to one of 
20110119152803.000|20110119152805.000|TR0|the grocery clerks in there.  He's 
20110119152805.000|20110119152808.000|TR0|pointing to his ear to indicate to the 
20110119152808.000|20110119152811.000|TR0|clerk that he can't hear because he's got 
20110119152811.000|20110119152813.000|TR0|ear plugs in.  Somewhat interesting.
20110119152813.000|20110119152816.000|TR0|
20110119152816.000|20110119152818.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  And in the proximity to 
20110119152818.000|20110119152821.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords, did you have a 
20110119152821.000|20110119152823.000|TR0|better view of exactly how close he was by 
20110119152823.000|20110119152826.000|TR0|looking at this videotape?
20110119152826.000|20110119152829.000|TR0|
20110119152829.000|20110119152831.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Yes, Fredricka, it was clear to 
20110119152831.000|20110119152834.000|TR0|me that he was within 24 to 36 inches 
20110119152834.000|20110119152836.000|TR0|within her face with the weapon.
20110119152836.000|20110119152839.000|TR0|
20110119152839.000|20110119152841.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Richard Kastigar, now this 
20110119152841.000|20110119152844.000|TR0|information, the surveillance tape, he 
20110119152844.000|20110119152847.000|TR0|said has already been passed over to the 
20110119152847.000|20110119152849.000|TR0|FBI. It is the hope of the Pima County 
20110119152849.000|20110119152852.000|TR0|Sheriff's Department to not try to, I 
20110119152852.000|20110119152854.000|TR0|guess, impair the trial, by releasing the 
20110119152854.000|20110119152857.000|TR0|video publicly, before releasing it to the 
20110119152857.000|20110119152859.000|TR0|FBI.  Is that about right?
20110119152859.000|20110119152902.000|TR0|
20110119152902.000|20110119152904.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Fredricka, you know, this case 
20110119152904.000|20110119152907.000|TR0|is not a who done it. We know very clearly 
20110119152907.000|20110119152910.000|TR0|from all the evidence and all the 
20110119152910.000|20110119152912.000|TR0|different witnesses and the witness  
20110119152912.000|20110119152915.000|TR0|accounts who committed this crime.  And, 
20110119152915.000|20110119152917.000|TR0|yes, we are protective of evidence.  But 
20110119152917.000|20110119152920.000|TR0|there are other reasons for it and they 
20110119152920.000|20110119152922.000|TR0|may become apparent, you know, down the 
20110119152922.000|20110119152925.000|TR0|road, some bits and pieces of this 
20110119152925.000|20110119152928.000|TR0|evidence.
20110119152928.000|20110119152930.000|TR0|
20110119152930.000|20110119152933.000|TR0|But my sincere concern with regard to this 
20110119152933.000|20110119152935.000|TR0|videotape was, yes, it is evidence.  I 
20110119152935.000|20110119152938.000|TR0|wanted to protect the families from this 
20110119152938.000|20110119152940.000|TR0|graphic description.  However, I supposed 
20110119152940.000|20110119152943.000|TR0|it's a bit ironic for me to be speaking 
20110119152943.000|20110119152945.000|TR0|about it.  But it is out there.  And 
20110119152945.000|20110119152948.000|TR0|actually this morning, I did talk to the 
20110119152948.000|20110119152951.000|TR0|family and let them know that we have 
20110119152951.000|20110119152953.000|TR0|discussed this.
20110119152953.000|20110119152956.000|TR0|
20110119152956.000|20110119152958.000|TR0|But as it exists right not, it's with the 
20110119152958.000|20110119153001.000|TR0|FBI.  And I would imagine they're  doing 
20110119153001.000|20110119153003.000|TR0|other things with this right now.  And it 
20110119153003.000|20110119153006.000|TR0|may be presentable for some - throughout 
20110119153006.000|20110119153009.000|TR0|some future point.
20110119153009.000|20110119153011.000|TR0|
20110119153011.000|20110119153014.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Richard Kastigar, chief 
20110119153014.000|20110119153016.000|TR0|investigator with the Pima County 
20110119153016.000|20110119153019.000|TR0|Sheriff's Department.  Thanks for your 
20110119153019.000|20110119153021.000|TR0|time.  I appreciate that.
20110119153021.000|20110119153024.000|TR0|
20110119153024.000|20110119153026.000|TR0|KASTIGAR:  Thank you.
20110119153026.000|20110119153029.000|TR0|
20110119153029.000|20110119153032.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  And we'll have much more of 
20110119153032.000|20110119153034.000|TR0|the NEWSROOM after this short break.

20110119153044.000|20110119153047.000|TR0|cake can take you. Just ask the guy known 
20110119153047.000|20110119153050.000|TR0|as the ace of cakes, Duck (ph) Goldman has 
20110119153050.000|20110119153052.000|TR0|built up America with a recipe for

20110119153125.000|20110119153128.000|TR0|DUFF GOLDMAN, CHARM CITY CAKES:  Welcome 
20110119153128.000|20110119153131.000|TR0|to Charm City Cakes.
20110119153131.000|20110119153133.000|TR0|
20110119153133.000|20110119153136.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  He's a star on the Food Network 
20110119153136.000|20110119153138.000|TR0|and this is where his team spins out those 
20110119153138.000|20110119153141.000|TR0|dazzling creations that have captured the

20110119153143.000|20110119153146.000|TR0|
20110119153146.000|20110119153149.000|TR0|It wasn't always this way.  Eight years 
20110119153149.000|20110119153151.000|TR0|ago, Duff was a struggling musician, just 
20110119153151.000|20110119153154.000|TR0|looking for a way to pay the rent.
20110119153154.000|20110119153156.000|TR0|
20110119153156.000|20110119153159.000|TR0|(on camera):  What did you play in the 
20110119153159.000|20110119153201.000|TR0|band?
20110119153201.000|20110119153204.000|TR0|
20110119153204.000|20110119153206.000|TR0|GOLDMAN:  I'm a bass player.  I still am.
20110119153206.000|20110119153209.000|TR0|
20110119153209.000|20110119153212.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  So you were essentially 
20110119153212.000|20110119153214.000|TR0|unemployed.
20110119153214.000|20110119153217.000|TR0|
20110119153217.000|20110119153219.000|TR0|GOLDMAN:  Pretty much, yes.  So I called 
20110119153219.000|20110119153222.000|TR0|my dad and I said, "Dad, how do I start a 
20110119153222.000|20110119153224.000|TR0|business?  He said, "Sell a cake."  OK.

20110119153227.000|20110119153230.000|TR0|FOREMAN (voice-over):  By creating what 
20110119153230.000|20110119153232.000|TR0|others did not, Duff caught the attention 
20110119153232.000|20110119153235.000|TR0|of cable TV scouts and turned his small 
20110119153235.000|20110119153237.000|TR0|bakery into a big brand.  Ever since, 
20110119153237.000|20110119153240.000|TR0|people have listened to his ideas about 
20110119153240.000|20110119153242.000|TR0|business.
20110119153242.000|20110119153245.000|TR0|
20110119153245.000|20110119153247.000|TR0|GOLDMAN:  When I started this place, I 
20110119153247.000|20110119153250.000|TR0|sold a cake.  That first cake that I sold 
20110119153250.000|20110119153253.000|TR0|I got a deposit.  With that deposit I 
20110119153253.000|20110119153255.000|TR0|bought some cake pans.  I bought some 
20110119153255.000|20110119153258.000|TR0|flour.  I bought some eggs.  I bought some 
20110119153258.000|20110119153300.000|TR0|butter.  That's literally how simple it 
20110119153300.000|20110119153303.000|TR0|was.
20110119153303.000|20110119153305.000|TR0|
20110119153305.000|20110119153308.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  By buying only what he can 
20110119153308.000|20110119153311.000|TR0|afford and focusing on quality, he avoided 
20110119153311.000|20110119153313.000|TR0|the dangerous debt that doomed so many 
20110119153313.000|20110119153316.000|TR0|others during the recession.
20110119153316.000|20110119153318.000|TR0|
20110119153318.000|20110119153321.000|TR0|And so, the jobs have lasted and the 
20110119153321.000|20110119153323.000|TR0|customers keep on coming; some for a few 
20110119153323.000|20110119153326.000|TR0|hundred, some for many thousands of 
20110119153326.000|20110119153328.000|TR0|dollars per cake. And for Duff, the 
20110119153328.000|20110119153331.000|TR0|creations are spectacular, but the recipe 
20110119153331.000|20110119153334.000|TR0|remains simple.
20110119153334.000|20110119153336.000|TR0|
20110119153336.000|20110119153339.000|TR0|GOLDMAN:  To build in tough times, you 
20110119153339.000|20110119153341.000|TR0|need to do things correctly.  There's no 
20110119153341.000|20110119153344.000|TR0|short cut.  There's no formula.  There's 
20110119153344.000|20110119153346.000|TR0|no magic pill.  There's no spell.  There's 
20110119153346.000|20110119153349.000|TR0|no anything.  Just -- you need to pay your 
20110119153349.000|20110119153352.000|TR0|bills and keep your employees happy.  You 
20110119153352.000|20110119153354.000|TR0|just have to do a good job.

20110119153409.000|20110119153412.000|TR0|in middle America comes crashing down.

20110119153425.000|20110119153427.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  The stock market, 
20110119153427.000|20110119153430.000|TR0|well, the opening bell just rang just 
20110119153430.000|20110119153433.000|TR0|about an hour ago.  Let's take a look 
20110119153433.000|20110119153435.000|TR0|right now at the numbers with the Dow down 
20110119153435.000|20110119153438.000|TR0|just about five points or so.  Hopefully, 
20110119153438.000|20110119153440.000|TR0|things will perk up a little bit later on 
20110119153440.000|20110119153443.000|TR0|today.

20110119153445.000|20110119153448.000|TR0|Some encouraging news already, perhaps 
20110119153448.000|20110119153451.000|TR0|coming from the White House.  So, might 
20110119153451.000|20110119153453.000|TR0|there be a ricochet effect on the markets 
20110119153453.000|20110119153456.000|TR0|as well? Let's check in with -- oh, in 
20110119153456.000|20110119153458.000|TR0|fact, let's take a listen right now. That 
20110119153458.000|20110119153501.000|TR0|moment between President Barack Obama at 
20110119153501.000|20110119153503.000|TR0|the White House and Chinese president Hu

20110119153514.000|20110119153516.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110119153516.000|20110119153519.000|TR0|STATES:  At a time when some doubt the 
20110119153519.000|20110119153521.000|TR0|benefits of cooperation between the United 
20110119153521.000|20110119153524.000|TR0|States and china, this visit is also a 
20110119153524.000|20110119153526.000|TR0|chance to demonstrate a simple truth.  We 
20110119153526.000|20110119153529.000|TR0|have an enormous stake in each other's 
20110119153529.000|20110119153532.000|TR0|success.  In an interconnected world, in a 
20110119153532.000|20110119153534.000|TR0|global economy, nations, including our 
20110119153534.000|20110119153537.000|TR0|own, will be more prosperous and more 
20110119153537.000|20110119153539.000|TR0|secure when we work together.

20110119153547.000|20110119153549.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  So, apparently, the bilateral 
20110119153549.000|20110119153552.000|TR0|talks have been going on barely 30 
20110119153552.000|20110119153555.000|TR0|minutes, and already we understand from 
20110119153555.000|20110119153557.000|TR0|some White House sources that there is 
20110119153557.000|20110119153600.000|TR0|some progress to speak of.  Our business

20110119153602.000|20110119153605.000|TR0|York.  You talked with some contacts.

20110119153613.000|20110119153615.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, a senior 
20110119153615.000|20110119153618.000|TR0|administration official is giving some 
20110119153618.000|20110119153620.000|TR0|numbers to the work that they've been 
20110119153620.000|20110119153623.000|TR0|doing actually into the weeks heading up 
20110119153623.000|20110119153625.000|TR0|into this particular event.  You know, 
20110119153625.000|20110119153628.000|TR0|these things always have the stage craft 
20110119153628.000|20110119153630.000|TR0|and the diplomacy, and then the splur (ph) 
20110119153630.000|20110119153633.000|TR0|of business deals announced to sort of 
20110119153633.000|20110119153636.000|TR0|show they've accomplished something.
20110119153636.000|20110119153638.000|TR0|
20110119153638.000|20110119153641.000|TR0|Well, we know the size of the deals.  
20110119153641.000|20110119153643.000|TR0|They're going to announce $45 billion in 
20110119153643.000|20110119153646.000|TR0|new contracts, new contracts for exports 
20110119153646.000|20110119153648.000|TR0|from the United States to China in some 12 
20110119153648.000|20110119153651.000|TR0|different states.  These are businesses in 
20110119153651.000|20110119153654.000|TR0|about 12 different states, 70 different 
20110119153654.000|20110119153656.000|TR0|types of contracts. Everything from 
20110119153656.000|20110119153659.000|TR0|agriculture products to Honeywell 
20110119153659.000|20110119153701.000|TR0|projects, Cummings engines, a whole host 
20110119153701.000|20110119153704.000|TR0|of things, including some tie-ups for 
20110119153704.000|20110119153706.000|TR0|green technology as well.  Even a hybrid 
20110119153706.000|20110119153709.000|TR0|bus deal that will be announced today.
20110119153709.000|20110119153711.000|TR0|
20110119153711.000|20110119153714.000|TR0|Also, an announcement that a $19 billion 
20110119153714.000|20110119153717.000|TR0|of Boeing aircraft will be bought by the 
20110119153717.000|20110119153719.000|TR0|Chinese.  Some 200 different Boeing 
20110119153719.000|20110119153722.000|TR0|planes.  A big criticism has been that the 
20110119153722.000|20110119153724.000|TR0|Chinese don't buy enough of our stuff. The 
20110119153724.000|20110119153727.000|TR0|Chinese -- but when you buy a bunch of 
20110119153727.000|20110119153729.000|TR0|aircraft that helps to narrow the gap a 
20110119153729.000|20110119153732.000|TR0|little bit, although just a little bit. 
20110119153732.000|20110119153735.000|TR0|However, we do have a yawning deficit.
20110119153735.000|20110119153737.000|TR0|
20110119153737.000|20110119153740.000|TR0|Also, one other thing I wanted to tell you 
20110119153740.000|20110119153742.000|TR0|that the senior administration official 
20110119153742.000|20110119153745.000|TR0|was saying that that $45 billion in 
20110119153745.000|20110119153747.000|TR0|contracts announced today is going to be 
20110119153747.000|20110119153750.000|TR0|used to support - that's the word they 
20110119153750.000|20110119153753.000|TR0|used, support, 235,000 jobs.  Clearly, 
20110119153753.000|20110119153755.000|TR0|they're trying to put a spin on the optics 
20110119153755.000|20110119153758.000|TR0|of this whole event, that yes, this 
20110119153758.000|20110119153800.000|TR0|relationship can support American jobs, 
20110119153800.000|20110119153803.000|TR0|instead of all the headlines you just see 
20110119153803.000|20110119153805.000|TR0|about Americans losing jobs because of 
20110119153805.000|20110119153808.000|TR0|competition with China.      One other 
20110119153808.000|20110119153810.000|TR0|thing on software that I found 
20110119153810.000|20110119153813.000|TR0|interesting.  For years, software 
20110119153813.000|20110119153816.000|TR0|companies have been concerned that one of 
20110119153816.000|20110119153818.000|TR0|the biggest users of counterfeit American 
20110119153818.000|20110119153821.000|TR0|software is the Chinese government.  And 
20110119153821.000|20110119153823.000|TR0|they've said, how can China be serious 
20110119153823.000|20110119153826.000|TR0|about intellectual property rights when 
20110119153826.000|20110119153828.000|TR0|the government computers are run by 
20110119153828.000|20110119153831.000|TR0|counterfeit software?
20110119153831.000|20110119153834.000|TR0|
20110119153834.000|20110119153836.000|TR0|Well, again, the Chinese, according to our 
20110119153836.000|20110119153839.000|TR0|government, have promised to stop using 
20110119153839.000|20110119153841.000|TR0|counterfeit software.  In fact, this time, 
20110119153841.000|20110119153844.000|TR0|have put money in a budget in an audit 
20110119153844.000|20110119153846.000|TR0|process, to legalize the software used 
20110119153846.000|20110119153849.000|TR0|within china.  If the Chinese follow 
20110119153849.000|20110119153851.000|TR0|through on that, that would be a big win 
20110119153851.000|20110119153854.000|TR0|for the software industry.
20110119153854.000|20110119153857.000|TR0|
20110119153857.000|20110119153859.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  And so, Christine, real quick, 
20110119153859.000|20110119153902.000|TR0|that 245,000 jobs being supported - we're 
20110119153902.000|20110119153904.000|TR0|talking about sustaining existing jobs, is 
20110119153904.000|20110119153907.000|TR0|that what that lingo means?  Supporting?
20110119153907.000|20110119153909.000|TR0|

20110119153915.000|20110119153917.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  -- job creation.

20110119153920.000|20110119153922.000|TR0|ROMANS:  They used the word --
20110119153922.000|20110119153925.000|TR0|
20110119153925.000|20110119153927.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Right.
20110119153927.000|20110119153930.000|TR0|
20110119153930.000|20110119153932.000|TR0|ROMANS:  The word they use is support. 
20110119153932.000|20110119153935.000|TR0|They don't say create. They use support - 
20110119153935.000|20110119153938.000|TR0|235,000 jobs. Twelve states, 70 different 
20110119153938.000|20110119153940.000|TR0|types of contracts and companies, 
20110119153940.000|20110119153943.000|TR0|everything from those airplane purchases 
20110119153943.000|20110119153945.000|TR0|to a hybrid bus to clean energy deals to 
20110119153945.000|20110119153948.000|TR0|agriculture products.

20110119153950.000|20110119153953.000|TR0|This is short of a show craft of obviously 
20110119153953.000|20110119153956.000|TR0|this whole state diplomacy that they're 
20110119153956.000|20110119153958.000|TR0|going to show us a bunch of deals and 
20110119153958.000|20110119154001.000|TR0|working on them for some time.  Critics 
20110119154001.000|20110119154003.000|TR0|are going to say Hu Jintao is going to 
20110119154003.000|20110119154006.000|TR0|come bearing gifts and try to divert the 
20110119154006.000|20110119154008.000|TR0|attention from this big, unfair trading 
20110119154008.000|20110119154011.000|TR0|field -- playing field, by giving a few 
20110119154011.000|20110119154013.000|TR0|deals.  $45 billion is nothing to sneeze 
20110119154013.000|20110119154016.000|TR0|at.  And 235,000 jobs, if the White House 
20110119154016.000|20110119154019.000|TR0|is right, is -- you know, it's good.
20110119154019.000|20110119154021.000|TR0|
20110119154021.000|20110119154024.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  The signs of 
20110119154024.000|20110119154026.000|TR0|progress already very early in the game.  
20110119154026.000|20110119154029.000|TR0|Thanks so much, Christine Romans in New

20110119154034.000|20110119154037.000|TR0|All right, let's take a look at some of 
20110119154037.000|20110119154039.000|TR0|other stories making headlines.  Crews 
20110119154039.000|20110119154042.000|TR0|were working on a ruptured gas main in 
20110119154042.000|20110119154044.000|TR0|Philadelphia when this happened.  A spark 
20110119154044.000|20110119154047.000|TR0|tragically ignited.  A local station, WCAU 
20110119154047.000|20110119154049.000|TR0|captured the raging fireball.  A gas main 
20110119154049.000|20110119154052.000|TR0|exploded, killing one of the utility 
20110119154052.000|20110119154054.000|TR0|workers and injuring five other people.
20110119154054.000|20110119154057.000|TR0|
20110119154057.000|20110119154100.000|TR0|And in Colorado, a mother is charged in 
20110119154100.000|20110119154102.000|TR0|her child's death. Police say 34-year-old 
20110119154102.000|20110119154105.000|TR0|Shannon Johnson was on Facebook and left 
20110119154105.000|20110119154107.000|TR0|her son unattended in a bathtub.  The 
20110119154107.000|20110119154110.000|TR0|13-month-old infant drowned.

20110119154112.000|20110119154115.000|TR0|And Sargent Shriver died yesterday.  He 
20110119154115.000|20110119154118.000|TR0|married into the Kennedy clan but made 
20110119154118.000|20110119154120.000|TR0|quite a name for himself. Shriver ran the 
20110119154120.000|20110119154123.000|TR0|Peace Corps and later coordinated 
20110119154123.000|20110119154125.000|TR0|President Johnson's war on poverty.  And 
20110119154125.000|20110119154128.000|TR0|in a life devoted to public service, he 
20110119154128.000|20110119154130.000|TR0|also won the Medal of Freedom, the 
20110119154130.000|20110119154133.000|TR0|nation's highest civilian honor.  
20110119154133.000|20110119154136.000|TR0|Shriver's daughter Maria remembers him as 
20110119154136.000|20110119154138.000|TR0|a gentle man as he struggled through

20110119154146.000|20110119154148.000|TR0|SHRIVER:  Sometimes, he doesn't say 
20110119154148.000|20110119154151.000|TR0|anything, but sometimes he'll say you're 
20110119154151.000|20110119154153.000|TR0|beautiful.  And I'll say to him, "I'm your 
20110119154153.000|20110119154156.000|TR0|daughter, Maria."  He goes, "You are?"  I 
20110119154156.000|20110119154159.000|TR0|go, "I am.  You're my dad."  And he goes, 
20110119154159.000|20110119154201.000|TR0|"Wow."

20110119154209.000|20110119154211.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Sargent Shriver was surrounded 
20110119154211.000|20110119154214.000|TR0|by his five children and their families 
20110119154214.000|20110119154217.000|TR0|when he died.  He was 95.

20110119154219.000|20110119154222.000|TR0|And this hour, the U.S. Army is 
20110119154222.000|20110119154224.000|TR0|confronting the issue of suicide in its 
20110119154224.000|20110119154227.000|TR0|ranks.  The picture is decidedly mixed.  
20110119154227.000|20110119154229.000|TR0|While suicides fell among active duty 
20110119154229.000|20110119154232.000|TR0|personnel last year, there was a troubling 
20110119154232.000|20110119154234.000|TR0|increase in the reserves and the National 
20110119154234.000|20110119154237.000|TR0|Guard.  CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara 
20110119154237.000|20110119154240.000|TR0|Starr has been sifting through this study, 
20110119154240.000|20110119154242.000|TR0|and she's joining us now with a closer 
20110119154242.000|20110119154245.000|TR0|look.  Barbara?
20110119154245.000|20110119154247.000|TR0|
20110119154247.000|20110119154250.000|TR0|BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: 
20110119154250.000|20110119154252.000|TR0| Well, good morning to you, Fredricka.  At 
20110119154252.000|20110119154255.000|TR0|this hour, in fact, the Army is briefing 
20110119154255.000|20110119154258.000|TR0|reporters here in the Pentagon about all 
20110119154258.000|20110119154300.000|TR0|of this and it is a mixed picture.
20110119154300.000|20110119154303.000|TR0|
20110119154303.000|20110119154305.000|TR0|Let's look at some of the numbers right 
20110119154305.000|20110119154308.000|TR0|off the top here.  Now in the active duty 
20110119154308.000|20110119154310.000|TR0|military, those who are full-time active 
20110119154310.000|20110119154313.000|TR0|duty in the Army, in 2010 which just 
20110119154313.000|20110119154315.000|TR0|wrapped up, 156 suicides.  Certainly a 
20110119154315.000|20110119154318.000|TR0|tragedy, but a bit of good news, perhaps, 
20110119154318.000|20110119154321.000|TR0|if you can call it that. That's down six 
20110119154321.000|20110119154323.000|TR0|from last year.  The Army has been 
20110119154323.000|20110119154326.000|TR0|confronting escalating suicides for years 
20110119154326.000|20110119154328.000|TR0|now.  So, any decline shows a little hope, 
20110119154328.000|20110119154331.000|TR0|they think, that their suicide prevention 
20110119154331.000|20110119154333.000|TR0|and awareness programs are working.
20110119154333.000|20110119154336.000|TR0|
20110119154336.000|20110119154339.000|TR0|But in the guard and reserves, the figures 
20110119154339.000|20110119154341.000|TR0|there show you 65 more this year than 
20110119154341.000|20110119154344.000|TR0|last.  That's a problem they don't really 
20110119154344.000|20110119154346.000|TR0|know why that's happening.  The guard and 
20110119154346.000|20110119154349.000|TR0|reserves, about half of them never even 
20110119154349.000|20110119154351.000|TR0|deploy to the war zone.  These are people 
20110119154351.000|20110119154354.000|TR0|living in their communities, and this 
20110119154354.000|20110119154356.000|TR0|tragedy befalls them.  They commit 
20110119154356.000|20110119154359.000|TR0|suicide.  The Army just beginning to look 
20110119154359.000|20110119154402.000|TR0|at that.
20110119154402.000|20110119154404.000|TR0|
20110119154404.000|20110119154407.000|TR0|And a lot of suicide prevention, a lot of 
20110119154407.000|20110119154409.000|TR0|new mental health programs in the Army 
20110119154409.000|20110119154412.000|TR0|trying to offer counseling and awareness 
20110119154412.000|20110119154414.000|TR0|even before troops go to the war zone.  
20110119154414.000|20110119154417.000|TR0|Fred?
20110119154417.000|20110119154420.000|TR0|
20110119154420.000|20110119154422.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  Something else 
20110119154422.000|20110119154425.000|TR0|unrelated to this study that I want to ask 
20110119154425.000|20110119154427.000|TR0|you about.  Apparently, Mullen's wife 
20110119154427.000|20110119154430.000|TR0|fainted at a ceremony.  What more can you 
20110119154430.000|20110119154432.000|TR0|tell us about that?
20110119154432.000|20110119154435.000|TR0|
20110119154435.000|20110119154438.000|TR0|STARR:  Yes, just a little while ago, Mrs. 
20110119154438.000|20110119154440.000|TR0|Debra Mullen, who is the wife of -- we'll 
20110119154440.000|20110119154443.000|TR0|show you the video in a minute.  Mrs. 
20110119154443.000|20110119154445.000|TR0|Debra Mullen, the wife of the chairman of 
20110119154445.000|20110119154448.000|TR0|the joint chiefs of staff was with 
20110119154448.000|20110119154450.000|TR0|everyone at the White House on the South 
20110119154450.000|20110119154453.000|TR0|Lawn for the welcoming ceremony for the 
20110119154453.000|20110119154455.000|TR0|Chinese president.  She'd be standing 
20110119154455.000|20110119154458.000|TR0|along with everybody out in the cold on 
20110119154458.000|20110119154501.000|TR0|this cold Washington morning for about 40 
20110119154501.000|20110119154503.000|TR0|minutes.
20110119154503.000|20110119154506.000|TR0|
20110119154506.000|20110119154508.000|TR0|Let's show you the video now.  If you look 
20110119154508.000|20110119154511.000|TR0|very carefully between the two leaders, 
20110119154511.000|20110119154513.000|TR0|you will see a woman in a red coat 
20110119154513.000|20110119154516.000|TR0|falling,  and she is immediately helped up 
20110119154516.000|20110119154519.000|TR0|by a man in a Navy uniform next to her.  
20110119154519.000|20110119154521.000|TR0|Of course, her husband, Admiral Mike 
20110119154521.000|20110119154524.000|TR0|Mullen, we'll zoom in on that.  And you'll 
20110119154524.000|20110119154526.000|TR0|see this lady in a red coat.
20110119154526.000|20110119154529.000|TR0|
20110119154529.000|20110119154531.000|TR0|At first, Mullen's staff did not 
20110119154531.000|20110119154534.000|TR0|acknowledge what had happened. But a short 
20110119154534.000|20110119154536.000|TR0|time ago, they gave us a statement saying, 
20110119154536.000|20110119154539.000|TR0|quote, "Mrs. Mullen fainted this morning 
20110119154539.000|20110119154542.000|TR0|while attending the welcoming ceremony. 
20110119154542.000|20110119154544.000|TR0|She was escorted indoors by Admiral Mullen 
20110119154544.000|20110119154547.000|TR0|and quickly recovered.  She is doing just 
20110119154547.000|20110119154549.000|TR0|fine. We wish her the best."

20110119154552.000|20110119154554.000|TR0|Most people don't know Deborah Mullen.  We 
20110119154554.000|20110119154557.000|TR0|do.  I can tell you she's a lady who 
20110119154557.000|20110119154600.000|TR0|spends a lot of time behind the scenes 
20110119154600.000|20110119154602.000|TR0|working with the wounded troops, working 
20110119154602.000|20110119154605.000|TR0|with military families.  She's a really 
20110119154605.000|20110119154607.000|TR0|nice person, and we wish her the best.  
20110119154607.000|20110119154610.000|TR0|She was - she did -- her husband helped 
20110119154610.000|20110119154612.000|TR0|her up and she was escorted out under her 
20110119154612.000|20110119154615.000|TR0|own esteem (ph).  We'll be checking in on 
20110119154615.000|20110119154617.000|TR0|her medical condition.
20110119154617.000|20110119154620.000|TR0|
20110119154620.000|20110119154623.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Yes, glad to see she was able 
20110119154623.000|20110119154625.000|TR0|to walk out there.  All right.  Thanks so 
20110119154625.000|20110119154628.000|TR0|much for keeping us posted.  Of course, we 
20110119154628.000|20110119154630.000|TR0|wish her the best.
20110119154630.000|20110119154633.000|TR0|
20110119154633.000|20110119154635.000|TR0|All right, we're going to talk about 
20110119154635.000|20110119154638.000|TR0|caloric intake coming up. Calorie counts 
20110119154638.000|20110119154641.000|TR0|posted on restaurants -- at restaurants.  
20110119154641.000|20110119154643.000|TR0|They're supposed to help you make healthy 
20110119154643.000|20110119154646.000|TR0|decisions, right?  Well, a new study says 
20110119154646.000|20110119154648.000|TR0|that you don't really care after all.  You 
20110119154648.000|20110119154651.000|TR0|don't really care about that information.  
20110119154651.000|20110119154653.000|TR0|You order what you want anyway.  Is that 
20110119154653.000|20110119154656.000|TR0|you?
20110119154656.000|20110119154658.000|TR0|

20110119154704.000|20110119154706.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  So, when you go to 
20110119154706.000|20110119154709.000|TR0|a restaurant that posts how many calories 
20110119154709.000|20110119154711.000|TR0|are in the entrees, do you start thinking, 
20110119154711.000|20110119154714.000|TR0|maybe I shouldn't order that?  Well, a new 
20110119154714.000|20110119154716.000|TR0|study says you're still going to order 
20110119154716.000|20110119154719.000|TR0|what it is you want, no matter how ugly 
20110119154719.000|20110119154722.000|TR0|the truth is.
20110119154722.000|20110119154724.000|TR0|
20110119154724.000|20110119154727.000|TR0|Senior medical correspondent Elizabeth 
20110119154727.000|20110119154729.000|TR0|Cohen joins us now.  Why do we do that?  
20110119154729.000|20110119154732.000|TR0|So much for all this great help!
20110119154732.000|20110119154734.000|TR0|
20110119154734.000|20110119154737.000|TR0|ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL 
20110119154737.000|20110119154740.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Right. That's what this 
20110119154740.000|20110119154742.000|TR0|one study says.  So, this one study looked 
20110119154742.000|20110119154745.000|TR0|at people who ate at a restaurant called 
20110119154745.000|20110119154747.000|TR0|Taco Time, which I had never heard of 
20110119154747.000|20110119154750.000|TR0|that.  It's out west, it's in Seattle in 
20110119154750.000|20110119154752.000|TR0|the suburbs.  And that's an important 
20110119154752.000|20110119154755.000|TR0|distinction because in Seattle, you have 
20110119154755.000|20110119154757.000|TR0|to put how many calories are on - you have 
20110119154757.000|20110119154800.000|TR0|to put the calories on the menu.  But in 
20110119154800.000|20110119154803.000|TR0|the suburbs, you don't.
20110119154803.000|20110119154805.000|TR0|
20110119154805.000|20110119154808.000|TR0|So, they looked at was there a difference 
20110119154808.000|20110119154810.000|TR0|between how people ordered?  And they 
20110119154810.000|20110119154813.000|TR0|found that there wasn't.  And there were a 
20110119154813.000|20110119154815.000|TR0|lot of things you might want to think 
20110119154815.000|20110119154818.000|TR0|twice about at this restaurant.  For 
20110119154818.000|20110119154821.000|TR0|example, the 609-calorie beef natural soft 
20110119154821.000|20110119154823.000|TR0|taco or the 906-calorie beef big time 
20110119154823.000|20110119154826.000|TR0|Mexi-burrito.
20110119154826.000|20110119154828.000|TR0|
20110119154828.000|20110119154831.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  One taco?
20110119154831.000|20110119154833.000|TR0|
20110119154833.000|20110119154836.000|TR0|COHEN:  Yes.   906.  So, that's about half 
20110119154836.000|20110119154838.000|TR0|the calories some people are supposed to 
20110119154838.000|20110119154841.000|TR0|get in one burrito. So, apparently people 
20110119154841.000|20110119154844.000|TR0|didn't really care when they saw those 
20110119154844.000|20110119154846.000|TR0|numbers.       WHITFIELD:  Okay, so of 
20110119154846.000|20110119154849.000|TR0|course a lot of advocates for these whole 
20110119154849.000|20110119154851.000|TR0|labeling were hoping this is going to 
20110119154851.000|20110119154854.000|TR0|impact how people order food, et cetera.  
20110119154854.000|20110119154856.000|TR0|But it's not working.  They're not very 
20110119154856.000|20110119154859.000|TR0|encouraged now by this.
20110119154859.000|20110119154902.000|TR0|
20110119154902.000|20110119154904.000|TR0|COHEN:  Well, it's important to remember 
20110119154904.000|20110119154907.000|TR0|this is one restaurant. And so, maybe the 
20110119154907.000|20110119154909.000|TR0|kind of people who go to Taco Time don't 
20110119154909.000|20110119154912.000|TR0|really care so much about the calories.  
20110119154912.000|20110119154914.000|TR0|Maybe they want a taco.
20110119154914.000|20110119154917.000|TR0|
20110119154917.000|20110119154919.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  They want that 900-calorie 
20110119154919.000|20110119154922.000|TR0|burrito.
20110119154922.000|20110119154925.000|TR0|
20110119154925.000|20110119154927.000|TR0|COHEN:  They want that 900-calorie 
20110119154927.000|20110119154930.000|TR0|burrito, right!  That's what's important 
20110119154930.000|20110119154932.000|TR0|to them.  They go for the taste and so 
20110119154932.000|20110119154935.000|TR0|they don't care. Maybe it has to do with 
20110119154935.000|20110119154937.000|TR0|the way that it's labeled.  Maybe there 
20110119154937.000|20110119154940.000|TR0|aren't so many attractive alternatives 
20110119154940.000|20110119154943.000|TR0|that are less than 600 calories. Maybe 
20110119154943.000|20110119154945.000|TR0|that's the point.
20110119154945.000|20110119154948.000|TR0|
20110119154948.000|20110119154950.000|TR0|So, I wouldn't take too much.  It's 
20110119154950.000|20110119154953.000|TR0|interesting, though, at this one 
20110119154953.000|20110119154955.000|TR0|restaurant that's what they found.
20110119154955.000|20110119154958.000|TR0|
20110119154958.000|20110119155000.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  OK.  So at other restaurants 
20110119155000.000|20110119155003.000|TR0|that adhere to, you know, giving you some 
20110119155003.000|20110119155006.000|TR0|information about your meals, is there, I 
20110119155006.000|20110119155008.000|TR0|guess, a conclusion on those?
20110119155008.000|20110119155011.000|TR0|
20110119155011.000|20110119155013.000|TR0|COHEN:  Yes, they had a different 
20110119155013.000|20110119155016.000|TR0|experience.  For example, Starbucks in New 
20110119155016.000|20110119155018.000|TR0|York City.  They found when they put the 
20110119155018.000|20110119155021.000|TR0|calories on there, people actually did 
20110119155021.000|20110119155024.000|TR0|order -- you know, dishes that have fewer 
20110119155024.000|20110119155026.000|TR0|calories, or drinks that had fewer 
20110119155026.000|20110119155029.000|TR0|calories.  It did work.
20110119155029.000|20110119155031.000|TR0|
20110119155031.000|20110119155034.000|TR0|And also some restaurant chains, when they 
20110119155034.000|20110119155036.000|TR0|were forced to put the calories on there, 
20110119155036.000|20110119155039.000|TR0|the restaurant chains on their own said, 
20110119155039.000|20110119155042.000|TR0|oh, wait a minute, maybe we ought to 
20110119155042.000|20110119155044.000|TR0|change the menu up a little bit and come 
20110119155044.000|20110119155047.000|TR0|up with some healthy dishes.
20110119155047.000|20110119155049.000|TR0|
20110119155049.000|20110119155052.000|TR0|So, it really has had an impact.  But it 
20110119155052.000|20110119155054.000|TR0|is interesting that at least at this one 
20110119155054.000|20110119155057.000|TR0|restaurant with this particular clientele, 
20110119155057.000|20110119155059.000|TR0|it didn't seem to matter.
20110119155059.000|20110119155102.000|TR0|
20110119155102.000|20110119155105.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  Elizabeth Cohen, 
20110119155105.000|20110119155107.000|TR0|thanks so much.  It's always helpful to 
20110119155107.000|20110119155110.000|TR0|have a little extra information, but I 
20110119155110.000|20110119155112.000|TR0|guess if you get a hankering for a certain 
20110119155112.000|20110119155115.000|TR0|thing, you've got blinders on.
20110119155115.000|20110119155117.000|TR0|
20110119155117.000|20110119155120.000|TR0|COHEN:  Right.  But I know I've changed 
20110119155120.000|20110119155123.000|TR0|what I've ordered.
20110119155123.000|20110119155125.000|TR0|
20110119155125.000|20110119155128.000|TR0|WHITFIELD: Yes, I'm sure I have, too!
20110119155128.000|20110119155130.000|TR0|
20110119155130.000|20110119155133.000|TR0|COHEN:  Because I say, I want this, and 
20110119155133.000|20110119155135.000|TR0|then I'm like, whoa, you got to be 
20110119155135.000|20110119155138.000|TR0|kidding!  A chicken Caesar salad, all of 
20110119155138.000|20110119155140.000|TR0|that dressing, you know, let's get 
20110119155140.000|20110119155143.000|TR0|something else.
20110119155143.000|20110119155146.000|TR0|
20110119155146.000|20110119155148.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Yes!  All right.  Thanks so 
20110119155148.000|20110119155151.000|TR0|much.  Happy eating anyway.
20110119155151.000|20110119155153.000|TR0|
20110119155153.000|20110119155156.000|TR0|COHEN:  Thank you.

20110119155158.000|20110119155201.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  All right.  Sarah Palin, her 
20110119155201.000|20110119155204.000|TR0|popularity apparently sliding in the 
20110119155204.000|20110119155206.000|TR0|polls.  We'll get the lowdown on the

20110119155219.000|20110119155221.000|TR0|unfavorable rating is at an all-time high.

20110119155234.000|20110119155237.000|TR0|DIRECTOR:  I sure will. These are 
20110119155237.000|20110119155239.000|TR0|brand-new numbers, fresh on the ticker as 
20110119155239.000|20110119155242.000|TR0|well.  Fred, this is a case when an 
20110119155242.000|20110119155245.000|TR0|all-time high is a new low.  Check it out. 
20110119155245.000|20110119155247.000|TR0|Favorable and unfavorable opinion.  
20110119155247.000|20110119155250.000|TR0|Unfavorable opinion of Sarah Palin now up 
20110119155250.000|20110119155252.000|TR0|to 56 percent among Americans.  That's up 
20110119155252.000|20110119155255.000|TR0|7 points from last October when we polled 
20110119155255.000|20110119155257.000|TR0|last on her.
20110119155257.000|20110119155300.000|TR0|
20110119155300.000|20110119155302.000|TR0|You know, this comes after two weeks in 
20110119155302.000|20110119155305.000|TR0|which she's been spotlighted a lot because 
20110119155305.000|20110119155308.000|TR0|of those shootings in Arizona.  That may 
20110119155308.000|20110119155310.000|TR0|have been a contributing factor.
20110119155310.000|20110119155313.000|TR0|
20110119155313.000|20110119155315.000|TR0|Check this out as well.  Very partisan 
20110119155315.000|20110119155318.000|TR0|difference here on Sarah Palin -- 
20110119155318.000|20110119155320.000|TR0|Democrats.  They very much don't have a 
20110119155320.000|20110119155323.000|TR0|favorable opinion of Sarah Palin.  Look at 
20110119155323.000|20110119155326.000|TR0|that, Republicans still have a pretty 
20110119155326.000|20110119155328.000|TR0|favorable opinion of Sarah Palin.  There's 
20110119155328.000|20110119155331.000|TR0|a pretty big swing, and there's the 
20110119155331.000|20110119155333.000|TR0|unfavorables.  What a difference that is.
20110119155333.000|20110119155336.000|TR0|
20110119155336.000|20110119155338.000|TR0|Hey, Fred, earlier this hour, you were 
20110119155338.000|20110119155341.000|TR0|talking about that big health care vote in 
20110119155341.000|20110119155344.000|TR0|the House later today, a vote on possibly 
20110119155344.000|20110119155346.000|TR0|repealing health care.  We don't think it 
20110119155346.000|20110119155349.000|TR0|will get past the House, but it could pass 
20110119155349.000|20110119155351.000|TR0|there.  What do Americans think?  We know 
20110119155351.000|20110119155354.000|TR0|that Democrats and Republicans don't' 
20110119155354.000|20110119155356.000|TR0|agree on this issue.
20110119155356.000|20110119155359.000|TR0|
20110119155359.000|20110119155401.000|TR0|But check this out from the new poll as 
20110119155401.000|20110119155404.000|TR0|well.  It seems older and younger 
20110119155404.000|20110119155407.000|TR0|Americans don't agree on the issue as 
20110119155407.000|20110119155409.000|TR0|well.  Those under 50, well, they're kind 
20110119155409.000|20110119155412.000|TR0|of divided on whether the lawmakers should 
20110119155412.000|20110119155414.000|TR0|repeal all the provisions in the health 
20110119155414.000|20110119155417.000|TR0|care law.  But look at that, 50 and older, 
20110119155417.000|20110119155419.000|TR0|they favor repealing the health care law.  
20110119155419.000|20110119155422.000|TR0|That may be because some older Americans 
20110119155422.000|20110119155425.000|TR0|are worried that the new health care law 
20110119155425.000|20110119155427.000|TR0|could affect their benefits in that 
20110119155427.000|20110119155430.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE).

20110119155432.000|20110119155435.000|TR0|Fred, that's what I got right now on the

20110119155622.000|20110119155625.000|TR0|to get intoxicated anyway.  I don't like 
20110119155625.000|20110119155628.000|TR0|that sort of sense that you don't know

20110119155742.000|20110119155744.000|TR0|and I did yesterday, this doesn't have to 
20110119155744.000|20110119155747.000|TR0|do with skis or snowboards.  It has to do 
20110119155747.000|20110119155750.000|TR0|with snow biking, which is something -- 
20110119155750.000|20110119155752.000|TR0|it's a new thing on the mountain.
20110119155752.000|20110119155755.000|TR0|

20110119155800.000|20110119155802.000|TR0|MARCIANO: And after trying it, it's the 
20110119155802.000|20110119155805.000|TR0|one of the most -- it's just an absolute 
20110119155805.000|20110119155808.000|TR0|blast.  Instead of wheels, you've got skis 
20110119155808.000|20110119155810.000|TR0|on the bike, you've got little these Fred 
20110119155810.000|20110119155813.000|TR0|Flintstone-type skis on your feet. You 
20110119155813.000|20110119155815.000|TR0|just blast down the mountain, and it's 
20110119155815.000|20110119155818.000|TR0|just so much fun!
20110119155818.000|20110119155820.000|TR0|
20110119155820.000|20110119155823.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  And you're skiing the same 
20110119155823.000|20110119155825.000|TR0|runs or biking the same runs as the 
20110119155825.000|20110119155828.000|TR0|snowboarders?
20110119155828.000|20110119155831.000|TR0|
20110119155831.000|20110119155833.000|TR0|MARCIANO: That's it, man.  You just carry 
20110119155833.000|20110119155836.000|TR0|the bike on a lift. No!  Same runs.  So, 
20110119155836.000|20110119155838.000|TR0|it gets a little squirrely when you have 
20110119155838.000|20110119155841.000|TR0|limited skills like Reynolds and I have. 
20110119155841.000|20110119155843.000|TR0|So you've got to watch out for the crowds. 
20110119155843.000|20110119155846.000|TR0| I'm told it's fairly safe.  It was a lot 
20110119155846.000|20110119155849.000|TR0|more fun and not as painful as I thought 
20110119155849.000|20110119155851.000|TR0|it would be.

20110119155859.000|20110119155901.000|TR0|MARCIANO: Tomorrow, we're going to 
20110119155901.000|20110119155904.000|TR0|highlight some terrain park action.  I 
20110119155904.000|20110119155906.000|TR0|think you'll enjoy that.

20110119155909.000|20110119155912.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Oh, that looks like a lot of 
20110119155912.000|20110119155914.000|TR0|fun.  Although something tells me, the ski 
20110119155914.000|20110119155917.000|TR0|purists, they're getting used to the 
20110119155917.000|20110119155919.000|TR0|snowboarders. I don't think they're going 
20110119155919.000|20110119155922.000|TR0|like the bikers on the slopes, too.

20110119155927.000|20110119155930.000|TR0|right now, you got to love it right.  It's 
20110119155930.000|20110119155932.000|TR0|absolutely crushing.  It's dumping right 
20110119155932.000|20110119155935.000|TR0|now.
20110119155935.000|20110119155937.000|TR0|
20110119155937.000|20110119155940.000|TR0|WHITFIELD:  Oh, nice! All right, Rob 
20110119155940.000|20110119155942.000|TR0|Marciano, enjoy the flakes there at
