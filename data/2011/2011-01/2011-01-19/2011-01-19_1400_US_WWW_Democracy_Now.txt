20110119140130.273|20110119140132.340|TR0|ultimately should establish a

20110119140607.232|20110119140609.299|TR0|merger is going to increase 
20110119140609.299|20110119140611.366|TR0|prices for consumers, it's going 
20110119140611.366|20110119140613.433|TR0|to make independent voices even

20110119141127.596|20110119141129.663|TR0|Connecticut is expected to

20110119141131.730|20110119141133.797|TR0|rather than seek re-election 
20110119141133.797|20110119141135.863|TR0|when his term is up in 2012. 
20110119141135.863|20110119141137.930|TR0|Lieberman ran as an independent 
20110119141137.930|20110119141139.997|TR0|in 2006 after losing the 
20110119141139.997|20110119141142.064|TR0|Democratic primary. His 
20110119141142.064|20110119141144.131|TR0|announcement follows that of 
20110119141144.131|20110119141146.198|TR0|North Dakota Democratic Senator 
20110119141146.198|20110119141148.265|TR0|Kent Conrad, who also says he

20110119141200.666|20110119141202.733|TR0|years after he fled Haiti,

20110119141204.799|20110119141206.866|TR0|"Baby Doc" Duvalier is back. 
20110119141206.866|20110119141208.933|TR0|Duvalier left Haiti amidst 
20110119141208.933|20110119141211.000|TR0|protests in 1986 after a 15-year 
20110119141211.000|20110119141213.067|TR0|regime marked by corruption and 
20110119141213.067|20110119141215.134|TR0|torture and killing of his 
20110119141215.134|20110119141217.201|TR0|political opponents. On Monday, 
20110119141217.201|20110119141219.267|TR0|he returned to the 
20110119141219.267|20110119141221.334|TR0|earthquake-devastated country on 
20110119141221.334|20110119141223.401|TR0|a diplomatic passport and 
20110119141223.401|20110119141225.468|TR0|announced he was, quote, "here 
20110119141225.468|20110119141227.535|TR0|to see how I can help my

20110119141231.669|20110119141233.736|TR0|In a chaotic scene Tuesday, 
20110119141233.736|20110119141235.802|TR0|Haitian police detained Duvalier 
20110119141235.802|20110119141237.869|TR0|at the luxury hotel he was 
20110119141237.869|20110119141239.936|TR0|staying in and took him to the 
20110119141239.936|20110119141242.003|TR0|prosecutor's office in 
20110119141242.003|20110119141244.070|TR0|Port-au-Prince for questioning. 
20110119141244.070|20110119141246.137|TR0|Now Duvalier has been charged 
20110119141246.137|20110119141248.204|TR0|with corruption, theft and 
20110119141248.204|20110119141250.270|TR0|misappropriation of funds. Some 
20110119141250.270|20110119141252.337|TR0|estimates put the amount he 
20110119141252.337|20110119141254.404|TR0|embezzled at close to a billion 
20110119141254.404|20110119141256.471|TR0|dollars.

20110119141300.605|20110119141302.672|TR0|just weeks before a run-off

20110119141304.738|20110119141306.805|TR0|place. Haiti's largest political 
20110119141306.805|20110119141308.872|TR0|party, Lavalas, was excluded 
20110119141308.872|20110119141310.939|TR0|from the election. Lavalas is

20110119141329.541|20110119141331.608|TR0|Welcome to Democracy Now!, Kim. 
20110119141331.608|20110119141333.675|TR0|Talk about the record of Baby 
20110119141333.675|20110119141335.741|TR0|Doc Duvalier, for people who 
20110119141335.741|20110119141337.808|TR0|don't know the history of Haiti.
20110119141337.808|20110119141339.875|TR0|
20110119141339.875|20110119141341.942|TR0|>> KIM IVES: Baby Doc came to 
20110119141341.942|20110119141344.009|TR0|power in 1991 after his father, 
20110119141344.009|20110119141346.076|TR0|who had been elected in 1957, 
20110119141346.076|20110119141348.143|TR0|died. His father had himself 
20110119141348.143|20110119141350.209|TR0|declared president for life in 
20110119141350.209|20110119141352.276|TR0|1964, in a vote of about three 
20110119141352.276|20110119141354.343|TR0|million to 3,000, and passed 
20110119141354.343|20110119141356.410|TR0|that title on to Jean-Claude. 
20110119141356.410|20110119141358.477|TR0|The regime was extremely 
20110119141358.477|20110119141400.544|TR0|repressive and extremely 
20110119141400.544|20110119141402.611|TR0|corrupt. And Baby Doc became 
20110119141402.611|20110119141404.677|TR0|some kind of a playboy dictator, 
20110119141404.677|20110119141406.744|TR0|who would drive around in fast 
20110119141406.744|20110119141408.811|TR0|cars, throwing coins out to 
20110119141408.811|20110119141410.878|TR0|starving peasants on the side of 
20110119141410.878|20110119141412.945|TR0|the road. Disgust with his 
20110119141412.945|20110119141415.012|TR0|regime grew in Haiti.
20110119141415.012|20110119141417.079|TR0|
20110119141417.079|20110119141419.145|TR0|And impatience with the U.S. - 
20110119141419.145|20110119141421.212|TR0|the U.S. also grew impatient, 
20110119141421.212|20110119141423.279|TR0|because the millions of dollars 
20110119141423.279|20110119141425.346|TR0|the U.S. was funneling into the 
20110119141425.346|20110119141427.413|TR0|country to build an 
20110119141427.413|20110119141429.480|TR0|infrastructure for U.S. business 
20110119141429.480|20110119141431.547|TR0|to build cheap labor factories 
20110119141431.547|20110119141433.614|TR0|was being salted away in Swiss 
20110119141433.614|20110119141435.680|TR0|bank accounts by Jean-Claude. 
20110119141435.680|20110119141437.747|TR0|And so, in 1986, they pushed him 
20110119141437.747|20110119141439.814|TR0|out, as they were doing other 
20110119141439.814|20110119141441.881|TR0|dictators around the world and 
20110119141441.881|20110119141443.948|TR0|replacing them with facade 
20110119141443.948|20110119141446.015|TR0|election chosen puppets. 
20110119141446.015|20110119141448.082|TR0|However, in Haiti it didn't work 
20110119141448.082|20110119141450.148|TR0|so well, and instead of the 
20110119141450.148|20110119141452.215|TR0|U.S.-designated candidate, Marc 
20110119141452.215|20110119141454.282|TR0|Bazin, winning the election, it 
20110119141454.282|20110119141456.349|TR0|was Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 
20110119141456.349|20110119141458.416|TR0|1990.
20110119141458.416|20110119141500.483|TR0|
20110119141500.483|20110119141502.550|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Under Francois 
20110119141502.550|20110119141504.616|TR0|Duvalier, "Papa Doc," and then 
20110119141504.616|20110119141506.683|TR0|Baby Doc, who returned this 
20110119141506.683|20110119141508.750|TR0|week, how many Haitians were 
20110119141508.750|20110119141510.817|TR0|killed?
20110119141510.817|20110119141512.884|TR0|
20110119141512.884|20110119141514.951|TR0|>> KIM IVES: There are many 
20110119141514.951|20110119141517.018|TR0|estimates. In 1986, there was an 
20110119141517.018|20110119141519.084|TR0|estimate of about 10,000 killed 
20110119141519.084|20110119141521.151|TR0|under the regime, of both 
20110119141521.151|20110119141523.218|TR0|regimes. But it could go as high 
20110119141523.218|20110119141525.285|TR0|as 50,000, according to some 
20110119141525.285|20110119141527.352|TR0|estimates.
20110119141527.352|20110119141529.419|TR0|
20110119141529.419|20110119141531.486|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Why did he 
20110119141531.486|20110119141533.553|TR0|return, and how did he get back 
20110119141533.553|20110119141535.619|TR0|to Haiti?
20110119141535.619|20110119141537.686|TR0|
20110119141537.686|20110119141539.753|TR0|>> KIM IVES: Well, we think that 
20110119141539.753|20110119141541.820|TR0|it had something to do with the 
20110119141541.820|20110119141543.887|TR0|present situation of the 
20110119141543.887|20110119141545.954|TR0|electoral standoff. The 
20110119141545.954|20110119141548.021|TR0|Organization of American States 
20110119141548.021|20110119141550.087|TR0|is ordering Preval to change the 
20110119141550.087|20110119141552.154|TR0|results of the election held on 
20110119141552.154|20110119141554.221|TR0|November 28th, which was a 
20110119141554.221|20110119141556.288|TR0|completely ridiculous election 
20110119141556.288|20110119141558.355|TR0|marred by terrible 
20110119141558.355|20110119141600.422|TR0|irregularities. Preval's

20110119141602.489|20110119141604.555|TR0|said that his official party

20110119141606.622|20110119141608.689|TR0|in second after Mirlande 
20110119141608.689|20110119141610.756|TR0|Manigat, a right-wing 
20110119141610.756|20110119141612.823|TR0|neo-Duvalierist, and that they 
20110119141612.823|20110119141614.890|TR0|would go -
20110119141614.890|20110119141616.957|TR0|
20110119141616.957|20110119141619.023|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: She was the 
20110119141619.023|20110119141621.090|TR0|widow of another president of

20110119141625.224|20110119141627.291|TR0|>> KIM IVES: Yeah, well, she's 
20110119141627.291|20110119141629.358|TR0|the wife of a president - he 
20110119141629.358|20110119141631.425|TR0|hasn't yet died, but Leslie 
20110119141631.425|20110119141633.492|TR0|Manigat, who was basically 
20110119141633.492|20110119141635.558|TR0|installed by the military in 
20110119141635.558|20110119141637.625|TR0|1988 after an electoral 
20110119141637.625|20110119141639.692|TR0|bloodbath in 1987. So, the OAS 
20110119141639.692|20110119141641.759|TR0|came in and said, "No, no, no. 
20110119141641.759|20110119141643.826|TR0|That's not the right result. The 
20110119141643.826|20110119141645.893|TR0|right result should be that 
20110119141645.893|20110119141647.960|TR0|Michel Martelly, known as "Sweet 
20110119141647.960|20110119141650.026|TR0|Micky," a pro-coup kompas 
20110119141650.026|20110119141652.093|TR0|musician, who came in a very 
20110119141652.093|20110119141654.160|TR0|close third, should be in the 
20110119141654.160|20110119141656.227|TR0|runoff. Preval is resisting this 
20110119141656.227|20110119141658.294|TR0|and has not responded to the OAS 
20110119141658.294|20110119141700.361|TR0|report and seems to question its 
20110119141700.361|20110119141702.428|TR0|methodology. So, we think that 
20110119141702.428|20110119141704.494|TR0|Duvalier's arrival there is 
20110119141704.494|20110119141706.561|TR0|really an effort to pressure 
20110119141706.561|20110119141708.628|TR0|Preval and show him - in a way, 
20110119141708.628|20110119141710.695|TR0|rally the Duvalierist base, 
20110119141710.695|20110119141712.762|TR0|because he really is the symbol 
20110119141712.762|20110119141714.829|TR0|of that old guard that left 
20110119141714.829|20110119141716.896|TR0|power 25 years ago.

20110119141718.962|20110119141721.029|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: A lot of reports 
20110119141721.029|20110119141723.096|TR0|are saying that the 
20110119141723.096|20110119141725.163|TR0|international community has 
20110119141725.163|20110119141727.230|TR0|threatened Preval with exile 
20110119141727.230|20110119141729.297|TR0|himself if he doesn't bow to the 
20110119141729.297|20110119141731.364|TR0|new results.
20110119141731.364|20110119141733.431|TR0|
20110119141733.431|20110119141735.497|TR0|>> KIM IVES: Right. There 
20110119141735.497|20110119141737.564|TR0|apparently was even a meeting 
20110119141737.564|20110119141739.631|TR0|that the former OAS ambassador 
20110119141739.631|20110119141741.698|TR0|to Haiti, a fellow called 
20110119141741.698|20110119141743.765|TR0|Seitenfus, who has since been 
20110119141743.765|20110119141745.832|TR0|dismissed because of his 
20110119141745.832|20110119141747.899|TR0|frankness, made a - was in a 
20110119141747.899|20110119141749.965|TR0|meeting where they were actually 
20110119141749.965|20110119141752.032|TR0|discussing how to get a plane to 
20110119141752.032|20110119141754.099|TR0|ship Preval out. So, Preval, 
20110119141754.099|20110119141756.166|TR0|after bowing to U.S. and French 
20110119141756.166|20110119141758.233|TR0|and Canadian dictates over the 
20110119141758.233|20110119141800.300|TR0|past decade of his presidencies, 
20110119141800.300|20110119141802.367|TR0|is now finding out that once he 
20110119141802.367|20110119141804.433|TR0|begins to resist a little bit or 
20110119141804.433|20110119141806.500|TR0|try to do something his way, 
20110119141806.500|20110119141808.567|TR0|that he's going to be quickly 
20110119141808.567|20110119141810.634|TR0|dispensed with.

20110119141814.768|20110119141816.835|TR0|Duvalier comes into the country, 
20110119141816.835|20110119141818.901|TR0|and then he's arrested - or kind 
20110119141818.901|20110119141820.968|TR0|of - yesterday.
20110119141820.968|20110119141823.035|TR0|
20110119141823.035|20110119141825.102|TR0|>> KIM IVES: Well, kind of 
20110119141825.102|20110119141827.169|TR0|arrested, yeah. In fact, what 
20110119141827.169|20110119141829.236|TR0|happened was they questioned 
20110119141829.236|20110119141831.303|TR0|him. The judicial system, of 
20110119141831.303|20110119141833.369|TR0|course, is different in Haiti. 
20110119141833.369|20110119141835.436|TR0|You have what's called a juge 
20110119141835.436|20110119141837.503|TR0|d'instruction, a sort of 
20110119141837.503|20110119141839.570|TR0|investigating magistrate, who 
20110119141839.570|20110119141841.637|TR0|looks at all the evidence and 
20110119141841.637|20110119141843.704|TR0|decides - he has up to three 
20110119141843.704|20110119141845.771|TR0|months to decide now - whether 
20110119141845.771|20110119141847.838|TR0|in fact he's going to take 
20110119141847.838|20110119141849.904|TR0|Jean-Claude to trial or not. So 
20110119141849.904|20110119141851.971|TR0|he's, you could say, 
20110119141851.971|20110119141854.038|TR0|semi-charged. They're 
20110119141854.038|20110119141856.105|TR0|investigating, but he's not 
20110119141856.105|20110119141858.172|TR0|actually going to be brought to 
20110119141858.172|20110119141900.239|TR0|trial here.

20110119141904.372|20110119141906.439|TR0|Aristide, who has been trying 
20110119141906.439|20110119141908.506|TR0|to, wants to return to his 
20110119141908.506|20110119141910.573|TR0|country, the most popular 
20110119141910.573|20110119141912.640|TR0|political figure in Haiti, 
20110119141912.640|20110119141914.707|TR0|cannot return.

20110119141916.774|20110119141918.840|TR0|>> KIM IVES: Correct. He is 
20110119141918.840|20110119141920.907|TR0|still in exile in South Africa, 
20110119141920.907|20110119141922.974|TR0|there since the coup d'etat 
20110119141922.974|20110119141925.041|TR0|which overthrew him on February 
20110119141925.041|20110119141927.108|TR0|29th, 2004, when the U.S. Navy 
20110119141927.108|20110119141929.175|TR0|SEAL team kidnapped him from his 
20110119141929.175|20110119141931.242|TR0|home in Tabarre and took him to

20110119141939.509|20110119141941.576|TR0|taking place against the 
20110119141941.576|20110119141943.643|TR0|backdrop of a devastated 
20110119141943.643|20110119141945.710|TR0|country. We traveled with you to 
20110119141945.710|20110119141947.777|TR0|Haiti right after the earthquake 
20110119141947.777|20110119141949.843|TR0|and then six months after the 
20110119141949.843|20110119141951.910|TR0|earthquake. What about Haiti 
20110119141951.910|20110119141953.977|TR0|today? And how does this all fit 
20110119141953.977|20110119141956.044|TR0|into the lack of any kind of 
20110119141956.044|20110119141958.111|TR0|reconstruction in Haiti?

20110119142000.178|20110119142002.245|TR0|>> KIM IVES: Well, Haiti remains 
20110119142002.245|20110119142004.311|TR0|the only militarily occupied 
20110119142004.311|20110119142006.378|TR0|nation in the Western 
20110119142006.378|20110119142008.445|TR0|hemisphere. It is suffering 
20110119142008.445|20110119142010.512|TR0|under the results of the 
20110119142010.512|20110119142012.579|TR0|earthquake, 1.3 million people 
20110119142012.579|20110119142014.646|TR0|still living under tents and 
20110119142014.646|20110119142016.713|TR0|tarps. Cholera has killed 
20110119142016.713|20110119142018.779|TR0|closing on 4,000 people, and no 
20110119142018.779|20110119142020.846|TR0|end in sight. You have a 
20110119142020.846|20110119142022.913|TR0|tremendous level of poverty and 
20110119142022.913|20110119142024.980|TR0|misery in the country. So, the 
20110119142024.980|20110119142027.047|TR0|U.S.'s main concern is not all 
20110119142027.047|20110119142029.114|TR0|of this, but simply how to put a 
20110119142029.114|20110119142031.181|TR0|facade on this occupation of the 
20110119142031.181|20110119142033.247|TR0|country, how to basically put 
20110119142033.247|20110119142035.314|TR0|their people in. And for the 
20110119142035.314|20110119142037.381|TR0|first time in 20 years, since 
20110119142037.381|20110119142039.448|TR0|Aristide's election - first 
20110119142039.448|20110119142041.515|TR0|election in 1990, they have two 
20110119142041.515|20110119142043.582|TR0|neo-Duvalierist candidates who 
20110119142043.582|20110119142045.649|TR0|are positioned to take power 
20110119142045.649|20110119142047.716|TR0|through this completely bogus 
20110119142047.716|20110119142049.782|TR0|election. And the people are 
20110119142049.782|20110119142051.849|TR0|clamoring for a new election, to 
20110119142051.849|20110119142053.916|TR0|annul the election, but they're 
20110119142053.916|20110119142055.983|TR0|having none of it.

20110119142139.387|20110119142141.454|TR0|always felt that was the case, 
20110119142141.454|20110119142143.521|TR0|because the picture of his body 
20110119142143.521|20110119142145.588|TR0|showed that he had been reading

20110119143007.835|20110119143009.902|TR0|after. And a human life doesn't 
20110119143009.902|20110119143011.969|TR0|need negotiation. It's an 
20110119143011.969|20110119143014.036|TR0|urgency when it comes to human 
20110119143014.036|20110119143016.103|TR0|life. To save, we need to act

20110119143026.437|20110119143028.504|TR0|can I be with my children? As I 
20110119143028.504|20110119143030.571|TR0|was fed up, and it's time to be 
20110119143030.571|20110119143032.637|TR0|with my children, not to travel. 
20110119143032.637|20110119143034.704|TR0|I want to see them every day.

20110119143038.838|20110119143040.905|TR0|"tomorrow." If you can do it

20110119143128.443|20110119143130.510|TR0|thought the shelling from the

20110119143307.652|20110119143309.719|TR0|hopes, and in seconds, these 
20110119143309.719|20110119143311.786|TR0|dreams were killed. These 
20110119143311.786|20110119143313.853|TR0|flowers were dead. Three of my 
20110119143313.853|20110119143315.920|TR0|daughters and one niece were 
20110119143315.920|20110119143317.986|TR0|killed in one second on the 16th 
20110119143317.986|20110119143320.053|TR0|of January at a quarter to five 
20110119143320.053|20110119143322.120|TR0|p.m. Just a few seconds, I left 
20110119143322.120|20110119143324.187|TR0|them, and they stayed in the 
20110119143324.187|20110119143326.254|TR0|room - two daughters here, one 
20110119143326.254|20110119143328.321|TR0|daughter here, one daughter 
20110119143328.321|20110119143330.388|TR0|here, and my niece with them.
20110119143330.388|20110119143332.454|TR0|
20110119143332.454|20110119143334.521|TR0|The first shell came from the 
20110119143334.521|20110119143336.588|TR0|tank space, which is there, came 
20110119143336.588|20110119143338.655|TR0|to shell two daughters who were 
20110119143338.655|20110119143340.722|TR0|sitting here on their chairs. 
20110119143340.722|20110119143342.789|TR0|And when I heard this shell, I 
20110119143342.789|20110119143344.856|TR0|came inside the room to find, to 
20110119143344.856|20110119143346.923|TR0|look. I can't recognize my 
20110119143346.923|20110119143348.989|TR0|daughters. Their heads were cut 
20110119143348.989|20110119143351.056|TR0|off their bodies. They were 
20110119143351.056|20110119143353.123|TR0|separated from their bodies, and 
20110119143353.123|20110119143355.190|TR0|I can't recognize whose body is 
20110119143355.190|20110119143357.257|TR0|this. They were drowning in a 
20110119143357.257|20110119143359.324|TR0|pool of blood. This is the pool 
20110119143359.324|20110119143401.391|TR0|of blood. Even look here. This 
20110119143401.391|20110119143403.457|TR0|is their brain. These are parts 
20110119143403.457|20110119143405.524|TR0|of their brain. Aya was lying on 
20110119143405.524|20110119143407.591|TR0|the ground. Shatha was injured, 
20110119143407.591|20110119143409.658|TR0|and her eye is coming out. Her 
20110119143409.658|20110119143411.725|TR0|fingers were torn, just attached 
20110119143411.725|20110119143413.792|TR0|by a tag of skin. I felt 
20110119143413.792|20110119143415.859|TR0|disloved, out of space, 
20110119143415.859|20110119143417.925|TR0|screaming, "What can I do?"
20110119143417.925|20110119143419.992|TR0|
20110119143419.992|20110119143422.059|TR0|They were not satisfied by the 
20110119143422.059|20110119143424.126|TR0|first shell and to leave my 
20110119143424.126|20110119143426.193|TR0|eldest daughter. But the second 
20110119143426.193|20110119143428.260|TR0|shell soon came to kill Aya, to 
20110119143428.260|20110119143430.327|TR0|injure my niece, who came down 
20110119143430.327|20110119143432.393|TR0|from the third floor, and to 
20110119143432.393|20110119143434.460|TR0|kill my eldest daughter Bessan, 
20110119143434.460|20110119143436.527|TR0|who was in the kitchen and came 
20110119143436.527|20110119143438.594|TR0|at that moment, screaming and 
20110119143438.594|20110119143440.661|TR0|jumping, "Dad! Dad! Aya is 
20110119143440.661|20110119143442.728|TR0|injured!"
20110119143442.728|20110119143444.795|TR0|
20110119143444.795|20110119143446.862|TR0|The second shell, it penetrated 
20110119143446.862|20110119143448.928|TR0|the wall between this room to 
20110119143448.928|20110119143450.995|TR0|enter the other room. Look. This 
20110119143450.995|20110119143453.062|TR0|is the room with the weapons, 
20110119143453.062|20110119143455.129|TR0|where this room was fully 
20110119143455.129|20110119143457.196|TR0|equipped with weapons. These are 
20110119143457.196|20110119143459.263|TR0|the weapons which were in this 
20110119143459.263|20110119143501.330|TR0|room. These are the weapons. 
20110119143501.330|20110119143503.396|TR0|These are the weapons: the books 
20110119143503.396|20110119143505.463|TR0|and their clothes. These were 
20110119143505.463|20110119143507.530|TR0|the science handouts. There, you 
20110119143507.530|20110119143509.597|TR0|see, these are her handouts for 
20110119143509.597|20110119143511.664|TR0|the courses that she studies, 
20110119143511.664|20110119143513.731|TR0|which is stained with her blood. 
20110119143513.731|20110119143515.798|TR0|It's mixed with her blood. These 
20110119143515.798|20110119143517.864|TR0|are the books. These are the 
20110119143517.864|20110119143519.931|TR0|weapons that I equipped my 
20110119143519.931|20110119143521.998|TR0|daughters with: with education, 
20110119143521.998|20110119143524.065|TR0|with knowledge, with dreams, 
20110119143524.065|20110119143526.132|TR0|with hopes, with loves.

20110119143528.199|20110119143530.266|TR0|I am a gynecologist who 
20110119143530.266|20110119143532.332|TR0|practiced most of my time in 
20110119143532.332|20110119143534.399|TR0|Israel. I was trained in Israel. 
20110119143534.399|20110119143536.466|TR0|And I devoted my life and my 
20110119143536.466|20110119143538.533|TR0|work for the benefit of humanity 
20110119143538.533|20110119143540.600|TR0|and well-being, to serve 
20110119143540.600|20110119143542.667|TR0|patients, not as someone else 
20110119143542.667|20110119143544.734|TR0|that you are delivering or 
20110119143544.734|20110119143546.800|TR0|helping choose. I am dealing 
20110119143546.800|20110119143548.867|TR0|with patients and human beings. 
20110119143548.867|20110119143550.934|TR0|We treat patients equally, with 
20110119143550.934|20110119143553.001|TR0|respect, with dignity, with 
20110119143553.001|20110119143555.068|TR0|privacy. Politicians and leaders 
20110119143555.068|20110119143557.135|TR0|should learn from doctors these 
20110119143557.135|20110119143559.202|TR0|values and these norms and to 
20110119143559.202|20110119143601.269|TR0|adopt them.
20110119143601.269|20110119143603.335|TR0|
20110119143603.335|20110119143605.402|TR0|This invasion, from the 
20110119143605.402|20110119143607.469|TR0|beginning, I said it's useless. 
20110119143607.469|20110119143609.536|TR0|It's futile. No one is winning. 
20110119143609.536|20110119143611.603|TR0|The innocent civilians, the 
20110119143611.603|20110119143613.670|TR0|Gazans, civilians, paid the 
20110119143613.670|20110119143615.737|TR0|price of this invasion, no one 
20110119143615.737|20110119143617.803|TR0|else.
20110119143617.803|20110119143619.870|TR0|
20110119143619.870|20110119143621.937|TR0|Military ways proved its 
20110119143621.937|20110119143624.004|TR0|failure. We should look for 
20110119143624.004|20110119143626.071|TR0|other ways to give each other 
20110119143626.071|20110119143628.138|TR0|its rights. We don't want to 
20110119143628.138|20110119143630.205|TR0|speak about peace. Peace is - 
20110119143630.205|20110119143632.271|TR0|you know, this word lost its 
20110119143632.271|20110119143634.338|TR0|meaning. We should find 
20110119143634.338|20110119143636.405|TR0|something else: respect, 
20110119143636.405|20110119143638.472|TR0|equality, justice and 
20110119143638.472|20110119143640.539|TR0|partnership. That's what we 
20110119143640.539|20110119143642.606|TR0|should look for.

20110119143705.341|20110119143707.408|TR0|response to your children's 
20110119143707.408|20110119143709.475|TR0|killing. You are well known

20110119143711.542|20110119143713.609|TR0|doctor who works in Israel. You 
20110119143713.609|20110119143715.676|TR0|were updating people on the

20110119143726.010|20110119143728.077|TR0|their responsibility and to say, 
20110119143728.077|20110119143730.144|TR0|"We shelled the house."

20110119143738.411|20110119143740.478|TR0|opposed to be done immediate, to 
20110119143740.478|20110119143742.545|TR0|recognize that and to admit, to 
20110119143742.545|20110119143744.612|TR0|take responsibility from the 
20110119143744.612|20110119143746.678|TR0|first moment, because they 
20110119143746.678|20110119143748.745|TR0|shelled it. It's not after one 
20110119143748.745|20110119143750.812|TR0|month. It's the first day.
20110119143750.812|20110119143752.879|TR0|

20110119143801.147|20110119143803.213|TR0|tried to justify. We don't need 
20110119143803.213|20110119143805.280|TR0|to justify. It's better - we are 
20110119143805.280|20110119143807.347|TR0|human being, and it's a human to 
20110119143807.347|20110119143809.414|TR0|err. But a mistake is a mistake 
20110119143809.414|20110119143811.481|TR0|if we didn't learn from it, not 
20110119143811.481|20110119143813.548|TR0|to repeat those mistakes. They 
20110119143813.548|20110119143815.615|TR0|started to justify, to say there 
20110119143815.615|20110119143817.681|TR0|were snipers, the first day. The 
20110119143817.681|20110119143819.748|TR0|second scenario, there were 
20110119143819.748|20110119143821.815|TR0|militants. The third day, there 
20110119143821.815|20110119143823.882|TR0|were firing. And the fourth 
20110119143823.882|20110119143825.949|TR0|scenario, that they took 
20110119143825.949|20110119143828.016|TR0|shrapnels from my niece's wound,

20110119144404.914|20110119144406.981|TR0|January 16th, so you have just 
20110119144406.981|20110119144409.048|TR0|sued. What are you demanding?

20110119144411.115|20110119144413.182|TR0|>> DR. IZZELDIN ABUELAISH: 
20110119144413.182|20110119144415.249|TR0|Because they didn't leave any 
20110119144415.249|20110119144417.315|TR0|alternative for me within two 
20110119144417.315|20110119144419.382|TR0|years. I was using and used 
20110119144419.382|20110119144421.449|TR0|every possible peaceful way, 
20110119144421.449|20110119144423.516|TR0|with Israeli ministers, Knesset 
20110119144423.516|20110119144425.583|TR0|members. Please, we need the 
20110119144425.583|20110119144427.650|TR0|truth and, to bring those 
20110119144427.650|20110119144429.717|TR0|daughters justice, apology, 
20110119144429.717|20110119144431.783|TR0|responsibility and the 
20110119144431.783|20110119144433.850|TR0|consequences of that. That's 
20110119144433.850|20110119144435.917|TR0|what we want. It will be a new 
20110119144435.917|20110119144437.984|TR0|opportunity, a window of 
20110119144437.984|20110119144440.051|TR0|opportunity, for both nations, 
20110119144440.051|20110119144442.118|TR0|for the leadership to speak 
20110119144442.118|20110119144444.185|TR0|about the truth and to have the 
20110119144444.185|20110119144446.251|TR0|moral courage to move forward, 
20110119144446.251|20110119144448.318|TR0|not to deny. We need to take 
20110119144448.318|20110119144450.385|TR0|responsibility. So I asked for 
20110119144450.385|20110119144452.452|TR0|that, and I told, human life 
20110119144452.452|20110119144454.519|TR0|can't be valued by money, and 
20110119144454.519|20110119144456.586|TR0|it's time to give, not to take. 
20110119144456.586|20110119144458.653|TR0|Any compensation that comes, it 
20110119144458.653|20110119144500.720|TR0|will go for a foundation that I 
20110119144500.720|20110119144502.786|TR0|established, Daughters for Life, 
20110119144502.786|20110119144504.853|TR0|for health and education, for 
20110119144504.853|20110119144506.920|TR0|girls and women in the Middle 
20110119144506.920|20110119144508.987|TR0|East, including Israel. It's 
20110119144508.987|20110119144511.054|TR0|time for women to take the lead 
20110119144511.054|20110119144513.121|TR0|and to practice their full 
20110119144513.121|20110119144515.188|TR0|potential and their role. That's 
20110119144515.188|20110119144517.254|TR0|what I am determined. I want to 
20110119144517.254|20110119144519.321|TR0|see the plans of my daughters 
20110119144519.321|20110119144521.388|TR0|fulfilled by other girls.

20110119144527.589|20110119144529.656|TR0|siege of Gaza. Talk about what 
20110119144529.656|20110119144531.722|TR0|happened during that time.
20110119144531.722|20110119144533.789|TR0|
20110119144533.789|20110119144535.856|TR0|>> DR. IZZELDIN ABUELAISH: 
20110119144535.856|20110119144537.923|TR0|During that time, it was a crazy 
20110119144537.923|20110119144539.990|TR0|moment. Three weeks, no one 
20110119144539.990|20110119144542.057|TR0|knows about what happened. And 
20110119144542.057|20110119144544.124|TR0|the world was closing the eyes 
20110119144544.124|20110119144546.190|TR0|about what is happening in Gaza. 
20110119144546.190|20110119144548.257|TR0|Even for me in Gaza, we don't 
20110119144548.257|20110119144550.324|TR0|know what is happening outside 
20110119144550.324|20110119144552.391|TR0|my house. Just with a radio, I 
20110119144552.391|20110119144554.458|TR0|used to listen. And Gazans 
20110119144554.458|20110119144556.525|TR0|became numbers. Human beings are 
20110119144556.525|20110119144558.592|TR0|not numbers. They have faces. 
20110119144558.592|20110119144600.659|TR0|They have names. They have 
20110119144600.659|20110119144602.725|TR0|hopes. They have dreams. Can we 
20110119144602.725|20110119144604.792|TR0|get from there to consider a 
20110119144604.792|20110119144606.859|TR0|human being as a human being, 
20110119144606.859|20110119144608.926|TR0|not numbers? And that's what we 
20110119144608.926|20110119144610.993|TR0|need. Tell what happened, 16th 
20110119144610.993|20110119144613.060|TR0|of January, to open the eyes of 
20110119144613.060|20110119144615.127|TR0|the Israeli public, the 
20110119144615.127|20110119144617.193|TR0|international community, the

20110119144629.595|20110119144631.661|TR0|time? Then, it was the Israeli 
20110119144631.661|20110119144633.728|TR0|assault on Gaza. Your children 
20110119144633.728|20110119144635.795|TR0|were killed by a military that 
20110119144635.795|20110119144637.862|TR0|is armed and financed by the

20110119144646.129|20110119144648.196|TR0|speak. And it's important to 
20110119144648.196|20110119144650.263|TR0|transmit the message. The 
20110119144650.263|20110119144652.330|TR0|Americans, the American Jews, 
20110119144652.330|20110119144654.397|TR0|Arabs, Muslims everywhere, we 
20110119144654.397|20110119144656.464|TR0|need to communicate and to 
20110119144656.464|20110119144658.531|TR0|speak. Words are stronger than 
20110119144658.531|20110119144700.598|TR0|bullets. And without

20110119144704.731|20110119144706.798|TR0|going to solve? And I learned 
20110119144706.798|20110119144708.865|TR0|one thing: our enemy is our 
20110119144708.865|20110119144710.932|TR0|ignorance. We don't know. We 
20110119144710.932|20110119144712.999|TR0|don't know. And to know, we need 
20110119144712.999|20110119144715.066|TR0|to communicate and to explain 
20110119144715.066|20110119144717.132|TR0|face to face.

20110119144733.667|20110119144735.734|TR0|much the story of the

20110119144750.202|20110119144752.269|TR0|never tasted the childhood as 
20110119144752.269|20110119144754.336|TR0|millions in this world, which is 
20110119144754.336|20110119144756.403|TR0|man-made suffering. And this is 
20110119144756.403|20110119144758.470|TR0|the hope. It's man-made. So we, 
20110119144758.470|20110119144800.537|TR0|as a human being, we can 
20110119144800.537|20110119144802.603|TR0|challenge those man-made

20110119145445.641|20110119145447.708|TR0|wanted Gaza's economy to be,

20110119145449.775|20110119145451.842|TR0|lowest level possible consistent 
20110119145451.842|20110119145453.909|TR0|with avoiding a humanitarian 
20110119145453.909|20110119145455.976|TR0|crisis." Can you describe the 
20110119145455.976|20110119145458.043|TR0|conditions?

20110119145500.109|20110119145502.176|TR0|>> DR. IZZELDIN ABUELAISH: Gaza 
20110119145502.176|20110119145504.243|TR0|is collapsing. There is no life 
20110119145504.243|20110119145506.310|TR0|in Gaza. And that's - Gaza is 
20110119145506.310|20110119145508.377|TR0|stigmatized by everything you 
20110119145508.377|20110119145510.444|TR0|like for yourself, but for 
20110119145510.444|20110119145512.511|TR0|Gazans, say no - no life, no 
20110119145512.511|20110119145514.578|TR0|hope, no work, no employment. 
20110119145514.578|20110119145516.644|TR0|And some people - it's shame to 
20110119145516.644|20110119145518.711|TR0|say, we open the borders for 
20110119145518.711|20110119145520.778|TR0|food. Human life is not 
20110119145520.778|20110119145522.845|TR0|dependent on food. They are 
20110119145522.845|20110119145524.912|TR0|hungry for food, for employment, 
20110119145524.912|20110119145526.979|TR0|for freedom, for education, to 
20110119145526.979|20110119145529.046|TR0|taste their life and to feel 
20110119145529.046|20110119145531.112|TR0|that they are free in their 
20110119145531.112|20110119145533.179|TR0|life. That's what we need. What 
20110119145533.179|20110119145535.246|TR0|do you think of a person living 
20110119145535.246|20110119145537.313|TR0|in a palace, and you provide him 
20110119145537.313|20110119145539.380|TR0|with the best types of foods. He 
20110119145539.380|20110119145541.447|TR0|doesn't need the food. He needs 
20110119145541.447|20110119145543.514|TR0|the freedom. The most holy thing 
20110119145543.514|20110119145545.580|TR0|in the universe is a human being 
20110119145545.580|20110119145547.647|TR0|under freedom, freedom of 
20110119145547.647|20110119145549.714|TR0|poverty and occupation.
20110119145549.714|20110119145551.781|TR0|
20110119145551.781|20110119145553.848|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, what do you 
20110119145553.848|20110119145555.915|TR0|think has to happen right now?
20110119145555.915|20110119145557.982|TR0|
20110119145557.982|20110119145600.048|TR0|>> DR. IZZELDIN ABUELAISH: What 
20110119145600.048|20110119145602.115|TR0|to happen, that - to admit the 
20110119145602.115|20110119145604.182|TR0|rights of the Palestinians and 
20110119145604.182|20110119145606.249|TR0|to take active steps, and that 
20110119145606.249|20110119145608.316|TR0|there will never be a just and 
20110119145608.316|20110119145610.383|TR0|good peace just for one. Must be 
20110119145610.383|20110119145612.450|TR0|good and just for all, for 
20110119145612.450|20110119145614.517|TR0|Palestinians and Israelis. And I 
20110119145614.517|20110119145616.583|TR0|think it's time for the Israeli 
20110119145616.583|20110119145618.650|TR0|government and the Israeli 
20110119145618.650|20110119145620.717|TR0|people to stand up. We need to 
20110119145620.717|20110119145622.784|TR0|translate the resolutions into 
20110119145622.784|20110119145624.851|TR0|actions. There is a Palestinian 
20110119145624.851|20110119145626.918|TR0|nation and an Israeli nation, 
20110119145626.918|20110119145628.985|TR0|and they have to live sharing 
20110119145628.985|20110119145631.051|TR0|the land with respect, and that 
20110119145631.051|20110119145633.118|TR0|the dignity of the Palestinians 
20110119145633.118|20110119145635.185|TR0|equals the dignity of the 
20110119145635.185|20110119145637.252|TR0|Israelis. And the freedom of the 
20110119145637.252|20110119145639.319|TR0|Palestinians is linked to the 
20110119145639.319|20110119145641.386|TR0|freedom of the Israelis from 
20110119145641.386|20110119145643.453|TR0|their fears. The security of the 
20110119145643.453|20110119145645.519|TR0|Israelis and safety is linked to 
20110119145645.519|20110119145647.586|TR0|the safety and the security of 
20110119145647.586|20110119145649.653|TR0|the Palestinians, not dependent 
20110119145649.653|20110119145651.720|TR0|on the security and suffering of 
20110119145651.720|20110119145653.787|TR0|the Palestinians.

20110119145655.854|20110119145657.921|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And here in the 
20110119145657.921|20110119145659.987|TR0|United States you are. Your 
20110119145659.987|20110119145702.054|TR0|message to the American people?
20110119145702.054|20110119145704.121|TR0|
20110119145704.121|20110119145706.188|TR0|>> DR. IZZELDIN ABUELAISH: We 
20110119145706.188|20110119145708.255|TR0|need them to mediate and to take 
20110119145708.255|20110119145710.322|TR0|action, to say -
20110119145710.322|20110119145712.389|TR0|
20110119145712.389|20110119145714.456|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Your assessment 
20110119145714.456|20110119145716.522|TR0|of President Obama?
20110119145716.522|20110119145718.589|TR0|
20110119145718.589|20110119145720.656|TR0|>> DR. IZZELDIN ABUELAISH: Yes, 
20110119145720.656|20110119145722.723|TR0|and that's what do we need. If 
20110119145722.723|20110119145724.790|TR0|we care about each other, even 
20110119145724.790|20110119145726.857|TR0|about your friends, if they are 
20110119145726.857|20110119145728.924|TR0|making mistakes, tell them, 
20110119145728.924|20110119145730.990|TR0|"This is not good for your 
20110119145730.990|20110119145733.057|TR0|interest." We need to open their 
20110119145733.057|20110119145735.124|TR0|eyes. We may be hard and harsh 
20110119145735.124|20110119145737.191|TR0|with our beloved ones, from good 
20110119145737.191|20110119145739.258|TR0|will. And that's what I think. 
20110119145739.258|20110119145741.325|TR0|We need to open the eyes of the 
20110119145741.325|20110119145743.392|TR0|Israeli public, and even if the 
20110119145743.392|20110119145745.458|TR0|Palestinian leadership is not 
20110119145745.458|20110119145747.525|TR0|committed to say to them, "This 
20110119145747.525|20110119145749.592|TR0|is not for your interest." But 
20110119145749.592|20110119145751.659|TR0|also, the road map is the 
20110119145751.659|20110119145753.726|TR0|humanity between us, not the 
20110119145753.726|20110119145755.793|TR0|territory. You can't have 
20110119145755.793|20110119145757.860|TR0|everything and the other side 
20110119145757.860|20110119145759.926|TR0|have nothing. Peace has a price, 
20110119145759.926|20110119145801.993|TR0|to be by choice or from the 
20110119145801.993|20110119145804.060|TR0|heart. You can, by military 
20110119145804.060|20110119145806.127|TR0|ways, succeed for short term; 
20110119145806.127|20110119145808.194|TR0|you can force others to accept. 
20110119145808.194|20110119145810.261|TR0|But it is not sustainable, and 
20110119145810.261|20110119145812.328|TR0|we must look and to find the 
20110119145812.328|20110119145814.395|TR0|ways that are sustainable and to 
20110119145814.395|20110119145816.461|TR0|protect the future of our 
20110119145816.461|20110119145818.528|TR0|children and to put our children 
20110119145818.528|20110119145820.595|TR0|as a priority.
