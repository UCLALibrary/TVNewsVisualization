20110119214911.749|20110119215753.250|TR1|said fade out is that the voters repealing of kayla house majority leader barricades are indirectly telling senate majority leader harry reid to bring it on by the white house seems to be blowing off the whole thing confident the repeal africa isn't going anywhere cheer who believe of many including pathogenicity by those toward a vote for a few of them are this is a serious legislative efforts i don't think it's going anywhere well class or democrats underestimating republicans around on target with his right now in new york daily news columnist and senior writer for the daily caller as he copped comma democratic strategist robertson remains here he's in the middle american for prosperity ten phillips they are robert do you think democrats are are right in blowing off the republican effort today well that's about blowing off the ever i think it's really a missed opportunity by the republicans i think more could be done with this legislation on tort reform or selling insurance across state lines are for that matter more public access to more assistance for small businesses but every time the republican conservative leadership as part of the test they based they walk away from it for example during the bush years they control the house in the senate presents for five years they never moved on tort reform never moved on selling insurance liabilities and watchers keep it up up from right now but a m in particular those issues were brought up in blown off because the republicans had no power that's exactly right now i think the president in yours uh... what's going to happen there's old girl we saw what happened in the second the american people trying to speak to this administration is saying look you've gone too far cry two governments gotten too big a spending too much comeback come back to where we are rights esi here's the problem has to have some make a statement but it's also bolick in the senate uniting to bring it up it's not symbolic and here's why for all of the staffing act the idea of repealing opa mckarrick that you see on the left and the insistence from them that about affairs if they'd accompli this has been accused me successful already one we're still talking about it this is the law of the land and we are still having a public debate to these are democrats pivot carolyn maloney chuck schumer on the sunday talk shows this past weekend were saying we need to repeal parts of this law that's astonishing right here is uh... here's our erica define the role of rex ryan falling out senator harry reid visionary dot com at the repeal boat should die in the senate they should bring it all up for a vote iti still confident he's got the boats so then it isn't spinning your wheels if the senate picks it up it's not about spinning your wheels and you mention before about the republicans had no power the problem is two years the problem is they have no plan paul ryan wasn't had the most comprehensive plan as the chairman of the house budget committee annually a fourteen republicans supporting him and so i think the real challenger for republicans show what they want to do about people with pre-existing conditions and about people who might lose insurance because i had phyllis here we can set up michael had this vote but there are a lot of u_s_ senators up democrats up in two thousand twelve include my syndrome virginia jim webb who are a look at this no they're in trouble politically loan demand a vote that is not symbolic aziza wright ensued she felt like hers of course you know i was looking through the full swing the president obama esi who seems to be moving say they are hoping to tweaking this right he understands the car the twenty six states who are charging the laura challenging his constitutionally well i think is gretchen mentioned earlier everyone's up for reelection and twenty twelve that matters and so i think everyone's looking at this with that in mind to the president included he knows that he has to do something about the fact that pulling suggest the majority of this country is not in love with this law and the but the polling also shows that the anger towards bill subsiding only thirty percent of the most recent eight people want to see this bill repealed republicans are out of touch of the mainstream well you know if the poll was was of his allies abolition of all the railways and all the things that i think i ever sang together almost the polls and out of the writing about tujhe reg voters only ram reducing she did so well hawk actually come out for another segment kasia outfits in one of these will be wearing a sea stresses ohio straight ahead to present so i said i would like a republican by cracking down on all of a regulation is the leading the liberal base behind and moving seven l white jamba handout from smoking if your neighbor thinks it stinks the multimillion dollar legal battle added to the supreme court could set a precedent for the rest of the nation things out committed to the area say president baba signing an executive order reviewing the regulatory system he's a little he's business regulations in spurred job creation or ever republicans were voicing similar proposals throughout the economic crisis says the president is isis himself from his base going to the middle is the leading actually write political battle here away in a c copper advertiser mint in phillips at sea let's start with you what do you think the president to really yesterday same some of these things have just dom i liked it it was tough talk it was straight talk it wasn't the kind that's professorial rhetoric we're used to seeing from obama that ends up somewhere in the ether and nowhere so i liked it i'd think he's got to find favor again with the financial sector and you know is that he knows about twenty twelve i wish this was an admission that his policies were wrong but of course i think this is for the just politicking right that would do if you were if you want to believe the president's come to the middle rabu would you like to say well we're projecting rhetoric he could go to his own obama protection agency d_p_s_ the pier where they're going in trying to push cap and trade through this energy tax this code avec until the prices gas prices per jobs i think it's a guy's that's it we're done with this regulatory effort into it overseas to which it was wrong it's misguided let's railing creates all that we're directing the rabbit from what you've seen from what you're reading to you noticed the present acting a different direction why think wielding administration is going to go into the next two years in facing new challenges are taking a different approach but not in this case this problem this problem is initiated in january thirty first two thousand nine in the federal register with the begin this process subtler disillusioned ten arresting but democrats and liberals believe in economic growth i don't believe in bureaucracy that is overlapping a demon eyes as businesses healthy so i thought it i think the business knows that that's why so much couples pilot they don't trust what i've been in the regular queries no question your writers two trillion dollars of private-sector muddy waiting for a clearer economic message on regulatory reform the presents provided brought about a lot of good water provided israel is running growth in the private sector is is that information u_s_a_ because you know the president with a bunch of business leaders of farak jared in the office and save brock we make this better also reached out to the chamber of commerce rice and we'll move so it's a good bit again and i think in addition to what i'm saying is that the policies have been also business rhetoric has been hostile business the rhetoric that starr has been very inside business their fat cats their bloated their corrupts you're going to see a real change over the next two years because he has to have but yet we're also seeing tremendous success for the tarp program which is issued by the bush administration and the success of the automotive bailout so this presents a great deal to create private-sector growth and try to rebuild this economy but i think successes relevance and purpose i think in fact when he basically took over general motors that was the beginning of his numbers dropping american public wants poly count is now assistant secretary of the ratings or but we are now fifty four percent approval ratings if you had a lot attack in the middle of away from left adlai as yankee of are doing very well in ninety two when it is a marxist and socialist wants us to have the itinerary habitat for more than one about that right
