20110119165200.450|20110119165638.530|TR1|all right let's talk about something very important in our world here this morning and of course up the new republican controlled house is scheduled this morning to vote to repeal obama care and joining us on the following are actually not on the phone joining us actually live from the capitol various is smiling face congressman brian bilbray brian good morning their morning my daughter tells me the weather straight back back at home uh... you know i gotta tell ya i don't know if you heard us talking earlier will just get this out of the way seventy two with six to eight eight foot waves brian sixteen today you know i just know how to cut my hahahaha i know but you have important business to take care of their sir and uh... tell us what's going to happen today and what a relief means and i think that's the important thing what is it me i really means that there's going to vote but i think the vote is going to be strongly up alm supporting that we repealed the bill that was passed last year we go back and we do it right we do it psalm systematically we uh... address issues uh... such as uh... pre-existing conditions and and um... young young people staying on there their parents insurance but we eliminate things likes enlightened saying that americans do not have the right to live in the united states unless they'd bite an insurance policy at the end and we go back and talk about things they're like allowing people in california by gary health insurance in any state they want break up this monopoly that we've created for the insurance companies and also talk about a big one especially when i learned when i was a county supervisor working with the health departments and that is tort reform in california we have a thing called micro that rate actually reduces the cost of uh... insurance for for position still thirty to forty percent the rest the country ought to be looking like that we shouldn't have to be paying for lawsuits and other states because they don't have something like mike run their state ar state couldn't survive in my opinion in fact in a democratic com assembly and senate in california recognizes it microbe and tort reform is essential for health care it's too that washington would wake up to that well there's a lot of lawyers phone the strings there and it's all about lawyers making money and then hit on it you hit on it i'm going to be a lizard we don't we can't afford to have lawyers in the the delivery room in it and the sad thing about this our men and women into harm's way our soldiers did not get to sue their lawyers why there's somebody on welfare and somebody getting free health care get to sue their lawyers if it's really that important provide the most cost effective health care but you can't afford to continue to subsidize a trial lawyers and uh... you know i got brothers who are trial lawyers who frankly i think they'd them getting a little less money n and people getting more health care is a lot more important than us camille placating one group of the other alright littlest try to get to the heart of this do you do you really think that there are pieces of obama care that you'll be able to separate out and change and others couple things you like like you said you know pre-existing conditions in keeping your kids on the policy as long as they're full-time students but do you really believe with the senate controlled by the democrats in the president controlled but you know obviously democrat do you think anything can be changed in this bill and what will it take yes i think of one thing insist this mandate that that all employers have to start sending out prom you know declarations the federal government bob benefits that that on people are getting on my paperwork when we talk about tort reform i think the senate is going to have to finally addressed that i think that the the mandate that you have to buy something from somebody to be able living united states is an american citizen is absolute surviving than exited the legislative say all americans have to buy a general four by general motors car because we want that or judgment bicycle i think we can change although sincere yet five well best of luck to you and today what times about how would i don't know it's gonna be in the afternoon now so hopefully will obviate below it drastically they're talking about it now and i think there's a good example of and this is why we shouldn't have three thousand two thousand page uh... you know legislation this is why the new majority has come into a three-day waiting period before you ask anybody to vote on it not just of congressman mchenry isola public can read it and that's why we've got to get rule break it up and let's do it peaceful they have had such a great piece of legislation we should all be welcoming the chance to be able go over to get in well listen best of luck congressman brian bilbray and uh... we'll see when you get back here whenever that is i'm hoping to come back this weekend has a lot try to catch out there at that women sing together there you go buried elsewhere you find it express
