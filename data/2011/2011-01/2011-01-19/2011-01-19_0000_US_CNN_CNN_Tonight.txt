20110119000007.000|20110119000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST:  Thanks Wolf and good 
20110119000009.000|20110119000011.000|TR0|evening everyone.  Tonight at the White 
20110119000011.000|20110119000013.000|TR0|House two presidents are sharing a private 
20110119000013.000|20110119000015.000|TR0|dinner.  One is a Nobel Peace Prize 
20110119000015.000|20110119000017.000|TR0|winner.  The other is holding a Nobel 
20110119000017.000|20110119000019.000|TR0|Peace Prize winner in prison.  The China 
20110119000019.000|20110119000022.000|TR0|challenge shakes our times and tonight 
20110119000022.000|20110119000024.000|TR0|we'll break down your stake in President 
20110119000024.000|20110119000026.000|TR0|Obama s high-stake summitry.
20110119000026.000|20110119000028.000|TR0|
20110119000028.000|20110119000030.000|TR0|Plus how often do you fight a fight you 
20110119000030.000|20110119000032.000|TR0|know you're going to lose?  Keeping a 
20110119000032.000|20110119000035.000|TR0|promise is one good reason, sticking to 
20110119000035.000|20110119000037.000|TR0|principle another.

20110119000043.000|20110119000045.000|TR0|REP. MICHELE BACHMANN (R), MINNESOTA:  We 
20110119000045.000|20110119000048.000|TR0|aren't just going to check the box off and 
20110119000048.000|20110119000050.000|TR0|say that we've had one vote and we're 
20110119000050.000|20110119000052.000|TR0|going to move on to other topics.  We're 
20110119000052.000|20110119000054.000|TR0|staying full square behind the repeal of 
20110119000054.000|20110119000056.000|TR0|Obama-care and our commitment to defund it 
20110119000056.000|20110119000058.000|TR0|going forward.

20110119000105.000|20110119000107.000|TR0|KING:  But where is this debate heading?  
20110119000107.000|20110119000109.000|TR0|We have new CNN polling tonight on the 
20110119000109.000|20110119000111.000|TR0|health care repeal question and we'll talk 
20110119000111.000|20110119000113.000|TR0|to one of the most powerful members of the 
20110119000113.000|20110119000116.000|TR0|new House majority, the Budget Committee 
20110119000116.000|20110119000118.000|TR0|chairman, Paul Ryan, about whether he sees 
20110119000118.000|20110119000120.000|TR0|compromise or gridlock ahead.
20110119000120.000|20110119000122.000|TR0|
20110119000122.000|20110119000124.000|TR0|And Sarah Palin is, if anything, defiant.

20110119000133.000|20110119000135.000|TR0|ALASKA:  I will continue to speak out.  
20110119000135.000|20110119000137.000|TR0|They're not going to shut me up.

20110119000144.000|20110119000146.000|TR0|KING:  But former House Speaker Newt 
20110119000146.000|20110119000148.000|TR0|Gingrich says Governor Palin needs to 
20110119000148.000|20110119000150.000|TR0|choose her words more carefully.  It's a 
20110119000150.000|20110119000152.000|TR0|topic he does know something about and new 
20110119000152.000|20110119000155.000|TR0|numbers out today put the former Alaska 
20110119000155.000|20110119000157.000|TR0|governor's political standing at a new low.
20110119000157.000|20110119000159.000|TR0|
20110119000159.000|20110119000201.000|TR0|A packed hour ahead as you can see and we 
20110119000201.000|20110119000203.000|TR0|begin with dramatic breaking political 
20110119000203.000|20110119000205.000|TR0|news.  CNN has learned that Senator Joseph 
20110119000205.000|20110119000207.000|TR0|Lieberman of Connecticut will announce 
20110119000207.000|20110119000210.000|TR0|tomorrow he will not -- emphasis on not -- 
20110119000210.000|20110119000212.000|TR0|seek re-election in 2012.  Lieberman is an 
20110119000212.000|20110119000214.000|TR0|Independent and for all our talk about the 
20110119000214.000|20110119000216.000|TR0|vital center in American politics, he's 
20110119000216.000|20110119000218.000|TR0|not running in large part because he is a 
20110119000218.000|20110119000220.000|TR0|man without a home.
20110119000220.000|20110119000223.000|TR0|
20110119000223.000|20110119000225.000|TR0|That's remarkable, because just a decade 
20110119000225.000|20110119000227.000|TR0|ago he was Al Gore's running mate and he 
20110119000227.000|20110119000229.000|TR0|came within just a few hundred votes in 
20110119000229.000|20110119000231.000|TR0|Florida of being the Democratic vice 
20110119000231.000|20110119000233.000|TR0|president of the United States.  Our 
20110119000233.000|20110119000236.000|TR0|senior White House correspondent Ed Henry 
20110119000236.000|20110119000238.000|TR0|is working his sources on why Senator 
20110119000238.000|20110119000240.000|TR0|Lieberman is bowing out and why it matters.
20110119000240.000|20110119000242.000|TR0|
20110119000242.000|20110119000244.000|TR0|Also with us Democratic strategist Cornell 
20110119000244.000|20110119000246.000|TR0|Belcher, Republican strategist Jim Dyke 
20110119000246.000|20110119000249.000|TR0|and from New York founding member of the 
20110119000249.000|20110119000251.000|TR0|centrist group No Labels, John Avlon -- Ed 
20110119000251.000|20110119000253.000|TR0|Henry to you first.  I was just having a 
20110119000253.000|20110119000255.000|TR0|conversation with a Lieberman aide who 
20110119000255.000|20110119000257.000|TR0|confirmed this news. You were working 
20110119000257.000|20110119000259.000|TR0|sources earlier and of course their line 
20110119000259.000|20110119000301.000|TR0|is he believes he could have won but 
20110119000301.000|20110119000304.000|TR0|Senator Lieberman has wrestled with this 
20110119000304.000|20110119000306.000|TR0|for a very long time.  He had no promise 
20110119000306.000|20110119000308.000|TR0|that they would clear the Republican 
20110119000308.000|20110119000310.000|TR0|field.  He wasn't quite comfortable 
20110119000310.000|20110119000312.000|TR0|running as a Republican anyway and he 
20110119000312.000|20110119000314.000|TR0|certainly knew he would again face a 
20110119000314.000|20110119000317.000|TR0|challenge from the left in the Democratic 
20110119000317.000|20110119000319.000|TR0|Party.
20110119000319.000|20110119000321.000|TR0|
20110119000321.000|20110119000323.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110119000323.000|20110119000325.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. Several 
20110119000325.000|20110119000327.000|TR0|Democrats already thinking about getting 
20110119000327.000|20110119000330.000|TR0|in regardless of what Senator Lieberman 
20110119000330.000|20110119000332.000|TR0|was going to do and look at his poll 
20110119000332.000|20110119000334.000|TR0|numbers.  They have just plummeted in 
20110119000334.000|20110119000336.000|TR0|Connecticut and that's remarkable for 
20110119000336.000|20110119000338.000|TR0|someone who's been seen for so long as a 
20110119000338.000|20110119000340.000|TR0|statesman.  I think it's yet another sign 
20110119000340.000|20110119000343.000|TR0|clearly that this fever that swept 
20110119000343.000|20110119000345.000|TR0|through, you know, seats and states all 
20110119000345.000|20110119000347.000|TR0|around the country is even affecting 
20110119000347.000|20110119000349.000|TR0|someone like Joe Lieberman.
20110119000349.000|20110119000351.000|TR0|
20110119000351.000|20110119000353.000|TR0|People are angry and they're ready to toss 
20110119000353.000|20110119000356.000|TR0|people out.  And Joe Lieberman looked at 
20110119000356.000|20110119000358.000|TR0|those numbers in part.  That wasn't the 
20110119000358.000|20110119000400.000|TR0|only part of the decision but he looked at 
20110119000400.000|20110119000402.000|TR0|those numbers and decided he's not -- he 
20110119000402.000|20110119000404.000|TR0|doesn't have the stomach to do it again.  
20110119000404.000|20110119000406.000|TR0|And I think it's very clear that even as 
20110119000406.000|20110119000408.000|TR0|the president has now hired Bill Daley as 
20110119000408.000|20110119000411.000|TR0|his chief of staff.  He's got this op-ed 
20110119000411.000|20110119000413.000|TR0|in "The Wall Street Journal", an outreach 
20110119000413.000|20110119000415.000|TR0|to the business community about trying to 
20110119000415.000|20110119000417.000|TR0|wipe out regulations to try and create 
20110119000417.000|20110119000419.000|TR0|jobs, to try to reach out to the middle. 
20110119000419.000|20110119000421.000|TR0|The center is gone.
20110119000421.000|20110119000424.000|TR0|
20110119000424.000|20110119000426.000|TR0|KING:  You're shaking your head --
20110119000426.000|20110119000428.000|TR0|
20110119000428.000|20110119000430.000|TR0|JIM DYKE, REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CONSULTANT: 
20110119000430.000|20110119000432.000|TR0| No, to me the interesting thing is he was 
20110119000432.000|20110119000434.000|TR0|a few hundred votes away from being the 
20110119000434.000|20110119000437.000|TR0|Democratic vice president.  He was 
20110119000437.000|20110119000439.000|TR0|probably many fewer votes away from being 
20110119000439.000|20110119000441.000|TR0|the Republican vice presidential nominee.  
20110119000441.000|20110119000443.000|TR0|And I think that's probably more than this 
20110119000443.000|20110119000445.000|TR0|uproar across the country his problem.  He 
20110119000445.000|20110119000447.000|TR0|comes from a Democrat-leaning state.  He 
20110119000447.000|20110119000450.000|TR0|dodged it last time becoming an 
20110119000450.000|20110119000452.000|TR0|independent after losing his primary and 
20110119000452.000|20110119000454.000|TR0|he's in a tough spot.
20110119000454.000|20110119000456.000|TR0|
20110119000456.000|20110119000458.000|TR0|KING:  So John Avlon, you work with a new 
20110119000458.000|20110119000500.000|TR0|group that says you know we need to 
20110119000500.000|20110119000502.000|TR0|encourage this vital center of American 
20110119000502.000|20110119000505.000|TR0|politics. Well sure, there are some extra 
20110119000505.000|20110119000507.000|TR0|reasons, but Charlie Crist was a popular 
20110119000507.000|20110119000509.000|TR0|Republican governor, ran for Senate in 
20110119000509.000|20110119000511.000|TR0|Florida as an independent, blown out.  
20110119000511.000|20110119000513.000|TR0|Michael Bloomberg has looked at the 
20110119000513.000|20110119000515.000|TR0|question of running for president as an 
20110119000515.000|20110119000518.000|TR0|Independent, has come to the calculation 
20110119000518.000|20110119000520.000|TR0|it won't work.     I want you to listen to 
20110119000520.000|20110119000522.000|TR0|Senator Lieberman because I asked him 
20110119000522.000|20110119000524.000|TR0|about this a couple of months back, you 
20110119000524.000|20110119000526.000|TR0|know Senator, will you go back and run as 
20110119000526.000|20110119000528.000|TR0|a Democrat, will you run as a Republican 
20110119000528.000|20110119000531.000|TR0|or will you try to run in the middle.

20110119000539.000|20110119000541.000|TR0|KING:  You're up in 2012.  You have said 
20110119000541.000|20110119000544.000|TR0|you're more likely than not to run again 
20110119000544.000|20110119000546.000|TR0|as an Independent where you won last time. 
20110119000546.000|20110119000548.000|TR0| Have you ruled out running as a Democrat? 
20110119000548.000|20110119000550.000|TR0| You've said in the past you might 
20110119000550.000|20110119000552.000|TR0|possibly run as a Republican.

20110119000554.000|20110119000556.000|TR0|SEN. JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (I), CONNECTICUT:  
20110119000556.000|20110119000559.000|TR0|Yes.  Frankly, and this is what's great 
20110119000559.000|20110119000601.000|TR0|about being an Independent, you're free to 
20110119000601.000|20110119000603.000|TR0|consider any and all possibilities.  So I 
20110119000603.000|20110119000605.000|TR0|would say that I feel good about being an 
20110119000605.000|20110119000607.000|TR0|Independent at this moment in America's 
20110119000607.000|20110119000609.000|TR0|political life.  And it's probably most 
20110119000609.000|20110119000612.000|TR0|likely I would run again as an 
20110119000612.000|20110119000614.000|TR0|Independent, but I wouldn't rule anything 
20110119000614.000|20110119000616.000|TR0|out.  And that is running on either of the 
20110119000616.000|20110119000618.000|TR0|other parties.

20110119000625.000|20110119000627.000|TR0|KING:  John Avlon, now we know he won't 
20110119000627.000|20110119000629.000|TR0|run at all.  That's the decision he came 
20110119000629.000|20110119000631.000|TR0|to, but I feel good as an Independent.  
20110119000631.000|20110119000633.000|TR0|You can feel good as an Independent when 
20110119000633.000|20110119000635.000|TR0|you're in office but there is no home for 
20110119000635.000|20110119000638.000|TR0|Independents in American politics today 
20110119000638.000|20110119000640.000|TR0|despite all our talk about the vital 
20110119000640.000|20110119000642.000|TR0|center.
20110119000642.000|20110119000644.000|TR0|
20110119000644.000|20110119000646.000|TR0|JOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well and 
20110119000646.000|20110119000648.000|TR0|that's one of the biggest problems there 
20110119000648.000|20110119000651.000|TR0|is.  Because there are more Independent 
20110119000651.000|20110119000653.000|TR0|voters in this country than there are 
20110119000653.000|20110119000655.000|TR0|Democrats or Republicans.  That's true 
20110119000655.000|20110119000657.000|TR0|among registered voters in Connecticut.  
20110119000657.000|20110119000659.000|TR0|So the fact that Joe Lieberman is 
20110119000659.000|20110119000701.000|TR0|politically homeless in this political 
20110119000701.000|20110119000703.000|TR0|environment says more about the 
20110119000703.000|20110119000706.000|TR0|polarization of the two parties than it 
20110119000706.000|20110119000708.000|TR0|does about the electorate at large.
20110119000708.000|20110119000710.000|TR0|
20110119000710.000|20110119000712.000|TR0|It's very tough for an Independent to run 
20110119000712.000|20110119000714.000|TR0|again as an Independent.  But we saw just 
20110119000714.000|20110119000716.000|TR0|this cycle, we did see Lincoln Chafee win 
20110119000716.000|20110119000719.000|TR0|as an Independent in Rhode island.  We saw 
20110119000719.000|20110119000721.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) come within 2.2 points in 
20110119000721.000|20110119000723.000|TR0|Maine of becoming governor.  Lisa 
20110119000723.000|20110119000725.000|TR0|Murkowski effectively won as an 
20110119000725.000|20110119000727.000|TR0|Independent write-in candidate, although 
20110119000727.000|20110119000729.000|TR0|of course she's affiliated with 
20110119000729.000|20110119000732.000|TR0|Republicans.
20110119000732.000|20110119000734.000|TR0|
20110119000734.000|20110119000736.000|TR0|Joe Lieberman has been an honorable 
20110119000736.000|20110119000738.000|TR0|Independent voice in the center.  He's 
20110119000738.000|20110119000740.000|TR0|really been the last of the 9/11 
20110119000740.000|20110119000742.000|TR0|Democrats.  He easily wiped the floor with 
20110119000742.000|20110119000745.000|TR0|Ned Lamont and token Republican opposition 
20110119000745.000|20110119000747.000|TR0|six years ago and I think he probably 
20110119000747.000|20110119000749.000|TR0|could have won.  But he's four terms in.  
20110119000749.000|20110119000751.000|TR0|He's made a different decision.  But I 
20110119000751.000|20110119000753.000|TR0|think we should honor the fact that this 
20110119000753.000|20110119000755.000|TR0|is a guy who is respected across the aisle 
20110119000755.000|20110119000757.000|TR0|as a profile in courage.  And he not only 
20110119000757.000|20110119000800.000|TR0|was vice, as Jim Dyke said earlier, not 
20110119000800.000|20110119000802.000|TR0|only was Al Gore's V.P. nominee, but was 
20110119000802.000|20110119000804.000|TR0|seriously considered as John McCain's 
20110119000804.000|20110119000806.000|TR0|nominee just two years ago.  That is an 
20110119000806.000|20110119000808.000|TR0|extraordinary individual in American 
20110119000808.000|20110119000810.000|TR0|politics.  We need more like him.
20110119000810.000|20110119000813.000|TR0|
20110119000813.000|20110119000815.000|TR0|CORNELL BELCHER, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER:  Can 
20110119000815.000|20110119000817.000|TR0|I jump in real quickly?     KING:  Yes you 
20110119000817.000|20110119000819.000|TR0|can sir.
20110119000819.000|20110119000821.000|TR0|
20110119000821.000|20110119000823.000|TR0|BELCHER:  One also of the problems here is 
20110119000823.000|20110119000826.000|TR0|structural.  I mean just to be truthful it 
20110119000826.000|20110119000828.000|TR0|is also a structural problem and Jim, you 
20110119000828.000|20110119000830.000|TR0|know this.  The problem with Independents 
20110119000830.000|20110119000832.000|TR0|is if you're running as a Democrat or a 
20110119000832.000|20110119000834.000|TR0|Republican, you have a structure and there 
20110119000834.000|20110119000836.000|TR0|is the Republican senatorial campaign, 
20110119000836.000|20110119000839.000|TR0|there's a Democratic senatorial campaign.  
20110119000839.000|20110119000841.000|TR0|They're going to build structure around 
20110119000841.000|20110119000843.000|TR0|you.  They're going to raise millions of 
20110119000843.000|20110119000845.000|TR0|dollars around you.  They're going to 
20110119000845.000|20110119000847.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) around you.  It is hard for 
20110119000847.000|20110119000849.000|TR0|you to run as an Independent because 
20110119000849.000|20110119000851.000|TR0|there's no structure and so structurally 
20110119000851.000|20110119000854.000|TR0|our system is built for the two-party 
20110119000854.000|20110119000856.000|TR0|system.

20110119000902.000|20110119000904.000|TR0|back August 16, 2000; this was a guy who 
20110119000904.000|20110119000907.000|TR0|was Al Gore's running mate who was 
20110119000907.000|20110119000909.000|TR0|dreaming, dreaming of moving into the

20110119001001.000|20110119001003.000|TR0|like this?  Well, I'll tell you what.  I'm 
20110119001003.000|20110119001005.000|TR0|here to support John McCain, because 
20110119001005.000|20110119001007.000|TR0|country matters more than party.

20110119001018.000|20110119001020.000|TR0|KING:  So here's one of my questions.  I 
20110119001020.000|20110119001022.000|TR0|want to go to the map in a minute and look 
20110119001022.000|20110119001024.000|TR0|at the broader 2012 calculations for the 
20110119001024.000|20110119001027.000|TR0|Senate races, but here's my question.  
20110119001027.000|20110119001029.000|TR0|Here you have Joe Lieberman, 24 years in 
20110119001029.000|20110119001031.000|TR0|the United States Senate, 40 years in 
20110119001031.000|20110119001033.000|TR0|public service.  Now he says he's going to 
20110119001033.000|20110119001035.000|TR0|leave after 2012.
20110119001035.000|20110119001037.000|TR0|
20110119001037.000|20110119001040.000|TR0|You know, the president right now is 
20110119001040.000|20110119001042.000|TR0|looking for a defense secretary, Ed Henry. 
20110119001042.000|20110119001044.000|TR0| The president if he wins re-election 
20110119001044.000|20110119001046.000|TR0|might be looking for somebody down the 
20110119001046.000|20110119001048.000|TR0|road.  Maybe Joe Lieberman's chances are 
20110119001048.000|20110119001050.000|TR0|better if the Republicans win the next 
20110119001050.000|20110119001052.000|TR0|presidential election.  But remember in 
20110119001052.000|20110119001055.000|TR0|that speech we just showed you I'm John 
20110119001055.000|20110119001057.000|TR0|McCain's friend. I'm here for that.  But 
20110119001057.000|20110119001059.000|TR0|he essentially said to Barack Obama, and 
20110119001059.000|20110119001101.000|TR0|I'm paraphrasing at home -- this is not 
20110119001101.000|20110119001103.000|TR0|exactly what he said -- but he essentially 
20110119001103.000|20110119001105.000|TR0|said nice young man, not ready to be 
20110119001105.000|20110119001108.000|TR0|president of the United States.  Is there 
20110119001108.000|20110119001110.000|TR0|any chance they will forgive and forget --
20110119001110.000|20110119001112.000|TR0|
20110119001112.000|20110119001114.000|TR0|HENRY:  Highly, highly unlikely.  He has 
20110119001114.000|20110119001116.000|TR0|the credentials for it, you're absolutely 
20110119001116.000|20110119001118.000|TR0|right, but after giving that speech in 
20110119001118.000|20110119001121.000|TR0|Minneapolis/St. Paul basically saying he's 
20110119001121.000|20110119001123.000|TR0|not ready to be president, he's not ready 
20110119001123.000|20110119001125.000|TR0|to be commander in chief, how do you make 
20110119001125.000|20110119001127.000|TR0|him your defense secretary.  And I mean 
20110119001127.000|20110119001129.000|TR0|look, for Democrats, as you talk about the 
20110119001129.000|20110119001131.000|TR0|map, I mean you also had Kent Conrad, 
20110119001131.000|20110119001134.000|TR0|another more centrist Democratic senator 
20110119001134.000|20110119001136.000|TR0|today from North Dakota.
20110119001136.000|20110119001138.000|TR0|
20110119001138.000|20110119001140.000|TR0|He bowed out as well and said he's not 
20110119001140.000|20110119001142.000|TR0|going to run for re- election.  Well when 
20110119001142.000|20110119001144.000|TR0|North Dakota, the other Senate seat was up 
20110119001144.000|20110119001146.000|TR0|in November, that went big-time for the 
20110119001146.000|20110119001149.000|TR0|Republicans, like 75, 76 percent of the 
20110119001149.000|20110119001151.000|TR0|vote.  So the map is going to be difficult 
20110119001151.000|20110119001153.000|TR0|and challenging for the Democrats like it 
20110119001153.000|20110119001155.000|TR0|was in 2010.
20110119001155.000|20110119001157.000|TR0|
20110119001157.000|20110119001159.000|TR0|KING:  All right let me -- John and 
20110119001159.000|20110119001202.000|TR0|Cornell and Jim are going to stay with us 
20110119001202.000|20110119001204.000|TR0|the next block.  Let me get a final 
20110119001204.000|20110119001206.000|TR0|thought on this block on this map because 
20110119001206.000|20110119001208.000|TR0|Joe Lieberman -- stay right here -- he's 
20110119001208.000|20110119001210.000|TR0|the yellow up here, Independent in 
20110119001210.000|20110119001212.000|TR0|Connecticut.  Bernie Sanders, again he 
20110119001212.000|20110119001215.000|TR0|stays with the Democrats but he runs as an 
20110119001215.000|20110119001217.000|TR0|Independent from Vermont. Red states are 
20110119001217.000|20110119001219.000|TR0|Republicans up in 2012.
20110119001219.000|20110119001221.000|TR0|
20110119001221.000|20110119001223.000|TR0|Kay Bailey Hutchison has already decided 
20110119001223.000|20110119001225.000|TR0|she won't run.  That one, safe to say 
20110119001225.000|20110119001228.000|TR0|especially in a presidential election, 
20110119001228.000|20110119001230.000|TR0|that will stay in Republican hands, but 
20110119001230.000|20110119001232.000|TR0|Kent Conrad decided today -- that's 
20110119001232.000|20110119001234.000|TR0|someone Ed Henry was just talking about -- 
20110119001234.000|20110119001236.000|TR0|let me get this to light up a little bit 
20110119001236.000|20110119001238.000|TR0|-- there we go -- he's not going to run in 
20110119001238.000|20110119001240.000|TR0|North Dakota. You would have to say today 
20110119001240.000|20110119001243.000|TR0|you favor the Republicans there.
20110119001243.000|20110119001245.000|TR0|
20110119001245.000|20110119001247.000|TR0|Obama didn't carry that state.  That's 
20110119001247.000|20110119001249.000|TR0|Claire McCaskill, Florida, Republicans 
20110119001249.000|20110119001251.000|TR0|just won big this year.  That's a tough 
20110119001251.000|20110119001253.000|TR0|one for them. Republicans just won here, 
20110119001253.000|20110119001256.000|TR0|just won here, just won here, just won 
20110119001256.000|20110119001258.000|TR0|here.  Cornell Belcher, since I just -- I 
20110119001258.000|20110119001300.000|TR0|just circled all those.  I mean look it's 
20110119001300.000|20110119001302.000|TR0|a presidential year, so it's different 
20110119001302.000|20110119001304.000|TR0|from a midterm election year.  But if 
20110119001304.000|20110119001306.000|TR0|you're just looking at the energy and the 
20110119001306.000|20110119001309.000|TR0|results this year and you're looking at 
20110119001309.000|20110119001311.000|TR0|this map, you've got to be thinking, whoa, 
20110119001311.000|20110119001313.000|TR0|that's a steep hill.
20110119001313.000|20110119001315.000|TR0|
20110119001315.000|20110119001317.000|TR0|BELCHER:  Well I -- a friend of mine, Guy 
20110119001317.000|20110119001319.000|TR0|Cecil, just took over at the Democrat 
20110119001319.000|20110119001322.000|TR0|Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Guy, 
20110119001322.000|20110119001324.000|TR0|you have your work cut out for you.  The 
20110119001324.000|20110119001326.000|TR0|truth of the matter is there's going to be 
20110119001326.000|20110119001328.000|TR0|competitive states.  We're going to build 
20110119001328.000|20110119001330.000|TR0|infrastructure in all those states and is 
20110119001330.000|20110119001332.000|TR0|a presidential year that also helps us.  
20110119001332.000|20110119001335.000|TR0|Look, the Dakotas are tough.
20110119001335.000|20110119001337.000|TR0|
20110119001337.000|20110119001339.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) seems that we've had 
20110119001339.000|20110119001341.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) there before.  We're going to 
20110119001341.000|20110119001343.000|TR0|be competitive.  Florida is a state we've 
20110119001343.000|20110119001345.000|TR0|got to put in play. Missouri is a state 
20110119001345.000|20110119001347.000|TR0|that barely escaped us by what, a point or 
20110119001347.000|20110119001350.000|TR0|so last time around.  Democrats are going 
20110119001350.000|20110119001352.000|TR0|to be in play in all these states, but 
20110119001352.000|20110119001354.000|TR0|it's going to be about what I talked about 
20110119001354.000|20110119001356.000|TR0|earlier, it's about infrastructure -- 
20110119001356.000|20110119001358.000|TR0|infrastructure and money.
20110119001358.000|20110119001400.000|TR0|
20110119001400.000|20110119001403.000|TR0|KING:  Obviously again a presidential year 
20110119001403.000|20110119001405.000|TR0|is different than a midterm year.  We 
20110119001405.000|20110119001407.000|TR0|don't know exactly what the economy will 
20110119001407.000|20110119001409.000|TR0|be like, but having one in those blue 
20110119001409.000|20110119001411.000|TR0|states for the first time in a long time. 
20110119001411.000|20110119001413.000|TR0|Republicans have to look at this map.  If 
20110119001413.000|20110119001416.000|TR0|you're Mitch McConnell you're thinking I 
20110119001416.000|20110119001418.000|TR0|could be the majority leader.
20110119001418.000|20110119001420.000|TR0|
20110119001420.000|20110119001422.000|TR0|DYKE:  Well it definitely has to make you 
20110119001422.000|20110119001424.000|TR0|smile if you're a Republican, but it's 
20110119001424.000|20110119001426.000|TR0|important to remember that elections -- 
20110119001426.000|20110119001429.000|TR0|and this may sound simplistic, but it's 
20110119001429.000|20110119001431.000|TR0|all too often true are a choice between 
20110119001431.000|20110119001433.000|TR0|two candidates and a lot is going to 
20110119001433.000|20110119001435.000|TR0|depend on the candidates that the 
20110119001435.000|20110119001437.000|TR0|Democrats put up in those states and that 
20110119001437.000|20110119001439.000|TR0|the Republicans put up in those states.  I 
20110119001439.000|20110119001441.000|TR0|think you look back at the cycle that we 
20110119001441.000|20110119001444.000|TR0|just have and based on candidate choices, 
20110119001444.000|20110119001446.000|TR0|there may have been some different 
20110119001446.000|20110119001448.000|TR0|outcomes on both sides.  And I think 
20110119001448.000|20110119001450.000|TR0|that's the unknowable at this point.
20110119001450.000|20110119001452.000|TR0|
20110119001452.000|20110119001454.000|TR0|KING:  How diplomatic, based on candidate 
20110119001454.000|20110119001457.000|TR0|choices -- I like that. John Avon --

20110119001503.000|20110119001505.000|TR0|KING:  We've got to work in a break, John 
20110119001505.000|20110119001507.000|TR0|Avlon, but quickly for the work you're 
20110119001507.000|20110119001510.000|TR0|trying to do at No Labels, does a Joe 
20110119001510.000|20110119001512.000|TR0|Lieberman packing it in make it harder to 
20110119001512.000|20110119001514.000|TR0|go out in the country and say run in the 
20110119001514.000|20110119001516.000|TR0|middle because as Cornell just noted, the 
20110119001516.000|20110119001518.000|TR0|infrastructure is on the edges.  It's with 
20110119001518.000|20110119001520.000|TR0|the ideologues.
20110119001520.000|20110119001523.000|TR0|
20110119001523.000|20110119001525.000|TR0|AVLON:  Well that's the push back.  I mean 
20110119001525.000|20110119001527.000|TR0|you know the parties are more polarized 
20110119001527.000|20110119001529.000|TR0|than ever before.  That's where the 
20110119001529.000|20110119001531.000|TR0|infrastructure is, but that's not where 
20110119001531.000|20110119001533.000|TR0|the voters are.  So what we're trying to 
20110119001533.000|20110119001535.000|TR0|do is create an alternative architecture 
20110119001535.000|20110119001538.000|TR0|and encourage Senate candidates and 
20110119001538.000|20110119001540.000|TR0|gubernatorial candidates not to run 
20110119001540.000|20110119001542.000|TR0|against each other per se, but to run in 
20110119001542.000|20110119001544.000|TR0|the center in their primaries.  Want to 
20110119001544.000|20110119001546.000|TR0|strengthen the center rather than having 
20110119001546.000|20110119001548.000|TR0|this RINO hunting and DINO hunting we've 
20110119001548.000|20110119001551.000|TR0|seen at least unrepresentative candidates 
20110119001551.000|20110119001553.000|TR0|that don't represent their constituents --

20110119001640.000|20110119001642.000|TR0|tonight, but if the guy across the table 
20110119001642.000|20110119001645.000|TR0|to the president of China is wondering, 
20110119001645.000|20110119001647.000|TR0|what's this guy's political standing here 
20110119001647.000|20110119001649.000|TR0|at home.  Good news for the president 
20110119001649.000|20110119001651.000|TR0|today.  Our new CNN/Opinion Research 
20110119001651.000|20110119001653.000|TR0|Corporation poll says the president's 
20110119001653.000|20110119001655.000|TR0|approval rating is now up to 53 percent.  
20110119001655.000|20110119001658.000|TR0|That's up five points from just last month 
20110119001658.000|20110119001700.000|TR0|in December.
20110119001700.000|20110119001702.000|TR0|
20110119001702.000|20110119001704.000|TR0|And here's one of the reasons it's 
20110119001704.000|20110119001706.000|TR0|jumping.  The president up above 50 
20110119001706.000|20110119001708.000|TR0|percent in part because Independents like 
20110119001708.000|20110119001711.000|TR0|the job the president is doing.  Fifty-six 
20110119001711.000|20110119001713.000|TR0|percent of Independents now approve of how 
20110119001713.000|20110119001715.000|TR0|Barack Obama is handling his job as 
20110119001715.000|20110119001717.000|TR0|president.  That's up from 41 percent just 
20110119001717.000|20110119001719.000|TR0|last month.
20110119001719.000|20110119001721.000|TR0|
20110119001721.000|20110119001724.000|TR0|Cornell Belcher, to the Democratic 
20110119001724.000|20110119001726.000|TR0|pollster in the group first, some of this 
20110119001726.000|20110119001728.000|TR0|we assume because of when we took this 
20110119001728.000|20110119001730.000|TR0|poll is people like the president's 
20110119001730.000|20110119001732.000|TR0|reaction to the Tucson shooting.  We saw a 
20110119001732.000|20110119001734.000|TR0|drop among liberals when he cut the tax 
20110119001734.000|20110119001736.000|TR0|cut deal.  His support among liberals also 
20110119001736.000|20110119001739.000|TR0|jumped back up in this poll.  They seemed 
20110119001739.000|20110119001741.000|TR0|to be OK, we were mad last month.  We're 
20110119001741.000|20110119001743.000|TR0|going to forgive you now.  At 53 percent 
20110119001743.000|20110119001745.000|TR0|heading into a very critical time of 
20110119001745.000|20110119001747.000|TR0|divided government, how important is it 
20110119001747.000|20110119001749.000|TR0|the president is above 50?
20110119001749.000|20110119001752.000|TR0|
20110119001752.000|20110119001754.000|TR0|BELCHER:  It's fantastic.  I mean look, 
20110119001754.000|20110119001756.000|TR0|you remember when I was on your show about 
20110119001756.000|20110119001758.000|TR0|a month or so back when we were talking 
20110119001758.000|20110119001800.000|TR0|about this tax cuts and all the, sort of 
20110119001800.000|20110119001802.000|TR0|the left pundits were pooh-poohing it and 
20110119001802.000|20110119001805.000|TR0|I came on and I said look this is exactly 
20110119001805.000|20110119001807.000|TR0|the place he ought to be.  It's the middle 
20110119001807.000|20110119001809.000|TR0|of the road.  Americans don't want -- 
20110119001809.000|20110119001811.000|TR0|don't think Democrats --

20110119001813.000|20110119001815.000|TR0|KING:  Are you John Avlon or Cornell

20110119001818.000|20110119001820.000|TR0|

20110119001824.000|20110119001826.000|TR0|BELCHER:  This is exactly sort of the 
20110119001826.000|20110119001828.000|TR0|middle of the road place to be and get out 
20110119001828.000|20110119001830.000|TR0|of -- and sort of get above this and sort 
20110119001830.000|20110119001833.000|TR0|of get above the fray on this and be right 
20110119001833.000|20110119001835.000|TR0|in the middle of the road on this and 
20110119001835.000|20110119001837.000|TR0|compromise on this because Americans don't 
20110119001837.000|20110119001839.000|TR0|think Democrats and Republicans have all 
20110119001839.000|20110119001841.000|TR0|the answers.  This is going to be the 
20110119001841.000|20110119001843.000|TR0|perfect place for him to be and guess 
20110119001843.000|20110119001846.000|TR0|what?  He's being rewarded for being a 
20110119001846.000|20110119001848.000|TR0|bipartisan leader and looking like he's 
20110119001848.000|20110119001850.000|TR0|above the fray here.

20110119001856.000|20110119001859.000|TR0|AVLON:  When Cornell is singing from the 
20110119001859.000|20110119001901.000|TR0|centrist hymnal, you know Democrats are 
20110119001901.000|20110119001903.000|TR0|listening and looking towards 2012, and 
20110119001903.000|20110119001905.000|TR0|it's great. It's great to hear and it's 
20110119001905.000|20110119001907.000|TR0|smart stuff.  Look, that 15-point jump 
20110119001907.000|20110119001909.000|TR0|among Independents that is a huge deal.  
20110119001909.000|20110119001912.000|TR0|That is a huge deal for governing over the 
20110119001912.000|20110119001914.000|TR0|next two years.  That is a huge deal 
20110119001914.000|20110119001916.000|TR0|pivoting to 2012 because I mean that's not 
20110119001916.000|20110119001918.000|TR0|incidental.
20110119001918.000|20110119001920.000|TR0|
20110119001920.000|20110119001922.000|TR0|It's a reaction to how the president led 
20110119001922.000|20110119001924.000|TR0|during the lame duck and that flurry of 
20110119001924.000|20110119001927.000|TR0|legislation that got passed, the tax cut 
20110119001927.000|20110119001929.000|TR0|deal, START, "don't ask, don't tell", et 
20110119001929.000|20110119001931.000|TR0|cetera, and then his reaction to the 
20110119001931.000|20110119001933.000|TR0|Tucson shooting and that speech.

20110119001940.000|20110119001942.000|TR0|AVLON:  That is not a blip.  That is a big 
20110119001942.000|20110119001944.000|TR0|jump.
20110119001944.000|20110119001946.000|TR0|
20110119001946.000|20110119001948.000|TR0|KING:  You say it's not a blip.  It is a 
20110119001948.000|20110119001950.000|TR0|big jump, but it is also, is it not, a 
20110119001950.000|20110119001953.000|TR0|reflection of the volatility in American 
20110119001953.000|20110119001955.000|TR0|politics that he can take such a big jump 
20110119001955.000|20110119001957.000|TR0|in one month.  So if you're the 
20110119001957.000|20110119001959.000|TR0|Republicans now and you're in the middle 
20110119001959.000|20110119002001.000|TR0|of this health care confrontation, then a 
20110119002001.000|20110119002003.000|TR0|spending confrontation you have to be more 
20110119002003.000|20110119002006.000|TR0|careful if the president is above 50, but 
20110119002006.000|20110119002008.000|TR0|how do you change that number?
20110119002008.000|20110119002010.000|TR0|
20110119002010.000|20110119002012.000|TR0|DYKE:  Well for one the president was drug 
20110119002012.000|20110119002014.000|TR0|kicking and screaming to do the tax deal, 
20110119002014.000|20110119002016.000|TR0|remember?  Republicans were hostage 
20110119002016.000|20110119002019.000|TR0|takers. That's how that got done.  We're 
20110119002019.000|20110119002021.000|TR0|now saying it was a good thing for him --
20110119002021.000|20110119002023.000|TR0|
20110119002023.000|20110119002025.000|TR0|KING:  You're letting facts get in the way

20110119002036.000|20110119002038.000|TR0|debate, Resurgent Republic (ph), which I 
20110119002038.000|20110119002040.000|TR0|do a little bit of work for, was out with 
20110119002040.000|20110119002042.000|TR0|a poll today on Independents.  And 
20110119002042.000|20110119002044.000|TR0|Independents have not gone back to 
20110119002044.000|20110119002047.000|TR0|President Obama on health care.  Health 
20110119002047.000|20110119002049.000|TR0|care is going to continue to be an issue.  
20110119002049.000|20110119002051.000|TR0|It's not the symbolic one-shot deal.
20110119002051.000|20110119002053.000|TR0|
20110119002053.000|20110119002055.000|TR0|Republicans to your question have to stick 
20110119002055.000|20110119002057.000|TR0|to the facts, have to continue to 
20110119002057.000|20110119002100.000|TR0|implement the things that they were 
20110119002100.000|20110119002102.000|TR0|elected to do and do it in a way that is 
20110119002102.000|20110119002104.000|TR0|factual and substantive.  And the 
20110119002104.000|20110119002106.000|TR0|president will either come along or he 
20110119002106.000|20110119002108.000|TR0|won't.

20110119002110.000|20110119002113.000|TR0|KING:  But at the White House, Ed, they 
20110119002113.000|20110119002115.000|TR0|have to assume heading into this now they 
20110119002115.000|20110119002117.000|TR0|need to hold that number.  They need to 
20110119002117.000|20110119002119.000|TR0|hold that number and the volatility is 
20110119002119.000|20110119002121.000|TR0|what's interesting in our politics right 
20110119002121.000|20110119002123.000|TR0|now.  He could drop that 17 points if he 
20110119002123.000|20110119002125.000|TR0|does something that drives the 
20110119002125.000|20110119002128.000|TR0|Independents away.  However, they must 
20110119002128.000|20110119002130.000|TR0|think heading into health care and 
20110119002130.000|20110119002132.000|TR0|spending it gives him a bit more leverage 
20110119002132.000|20110119002134.000|TR0|to think you know that people are on my 
20110119002134.000|20110119002136.000|TR0|side.
20110119002136.000|20110119002138.000|TR0|
20110119002138.000|20110119002141.000|TR0|HENRY:  It does and now you've got 
20110119002141.000|20110119002143.000|TR0|Republicans talking about repealing health 
20110119002143.000|20110119002145.000|TR0|care instead of talking about creating 
20110119002145.000|20110119002147.000|TR0|jobs, which is something they said they 
20110119002147.000|20110119002149.000|TR0|were going to do back in November.  They 
20110119002149.000|20110119002151.000|TR0|were beating on the president for not 
20110119002151.000|20110119002154.000|TR0|spending enough time on that.  They 
20110119002154.000|20110119002156.000|TR0|haven't put an economic plan on the table 
20110119002156.000|20110119002158.000|TR0|yet.  And guess what, a week from tonight 
20110119002158.000|20110119002200.000|TR0|the president will have the megaphone yet 
20110119002200.000|20110119002202.000|TR0|again for the "State of the Union" address 
20110119002202.000|20110119002204.000|TR0|where he can build on this number and 
20110119002204.000|20110119002207.000|TR0|build on the tax deal that he had in late 
20110119002207.000|20110119002209.000|TR0|December and working with Republicans, the

20110119002331.000|20110119002333.000|TR0|Call it whatever you want, but you need

20110119002342.000|20110119002344.000|TR0|the trouble there is when a potential also

20110119002508.000|20110119002510.000|TR0|KING:  Former President Bill Clinton was 
20110119002510.000|20110119002512.000|TR0|on the campaign trail today in Chicago.  
20110119002512.000|20110119002514.000|TR0|And the tragedy in Tucson was among the 
20110119002514.000|20110119002517.000|TR0|issues on his mind.  During the Clinton 
20110119002517.000|20110119002519.000|TR0|presidency, Congress passed an assault 
20110119002519.000|20110119002521.000|TR0|weapons ban that outlawed large ammunition 
20110119002521.000|20110119002523.000|TR0|magazines.  But that law expired and the 
20110119002523.000|20110119002525.000|TR0|weapon used in the Tucson shooting was a 
20110119002525.000|20110119002527.000|TR0|nine- millimeter handgun with an 
20110119002527.000|20110119002530.000|TR0|ammunition clip holding more than 30

20110119002722.000|20110119002724.000|TR0|complaints.  What is very interesting is 
20110119002724.000|20110119002726.000|TR0|that, I mean look, he has virtually no

20110119002750.000|20110119002752.000|TR0|member of Congress?  Also I find 
20110119002752.000|20110119002754.000|TR0|interesting Bill Clinton talks about that, 
20110119002754.000|20110119002757.000|TR0|Bill Clinton did not mention that he 
20110119002757.000|20110119002759.000|TR0|actually fired Emanuel over the health 
20110119002759.000|20110119002801.000|TR0|care debacle, but I guess they got over 
20110119002801.000|20110119002803.000|TR0|that.

20110119002805.000|20110119002807.000|TR0|KING:  Bygones are bygones.  Andy, Andy, 
20110119002807.000|20110119002809.000|TR0|before I bring you in, I want you to 
20110119002809.000|20110119002812.000|TR0|listen to Carol Moseley Braun.  She's a 
20110119002812.000|20110119002814.000|TR0|former United States senator and now she's 
20110119002814.000|20110119002816.000|TR0|running in this race.  And she believes 
20110119002816.000|20110119002818.000|TR0|she can get some support in the 
20110119002818.000|20110119002820.000|TR0|African-American community.  But I want 
20110119002820.000|20110119002822.000|TR0|you to listen to her case here saying I 
20110119002822.000|20110119002825.000|TR0|have the most credentials.  We'll talk on 
20110119002825.000|20110119002827.000|TR0|the other side.

20110119002835.000|20110119002838.000|TR0|CANDIDATE:  I have the most credentials 
20110119002838.000|20110119002840.000|TR0|and the most qualifications and experience 
20110119002840.000|20110119002842.000|TR0|of all of the candidates running.  And so 
20110119002842.000|20110119002844.000|TR0|they just chose the most qualified 
20110119002844.000|20110119002846.000|TR0|candidate for the job.  This is building 
20110119002846.000|20110119002848.000|TR0|momentum; this is getting our bandwagon 
20110119002848.000|20110119002851.000|TR0|going.  You know we like to say we're 
20110119002851.000|20110119002853.000|TR0|getting the band together again.

20110119002859.000|20110119002901.000|TR0|KING:  That was at a unity rally with 
20110119002901.000|20110119002903.000|TR0|other African-American leaders in the 
20110119002903.000|20110119002906.000|TR0|community, but can she make the case -- 
20110119002906.000|20110119002908.000|TR0|you can say Rahm Emanuel you don't want 
20110119002908.000|20110119002910.000|TR0|him as mayor, but he's been a congressman. 
20110119002910.000|20110119002912.000|TR0|He's been a White House chief of staff.  
20110119002912.000|20110119002914.000|TR0|He's been a White House aide. Carol 
20110119002914.000|20110119002916.000|TR0|Moseley Braun have more experience, more 
20110119002916.000|20110119002919.000|TR0|credentials?

20110119002921.000|20110119002923.000|TR0|ANDY SHAW, EXEC. DIRECTOR, BETTER 
20110119002923.000|20110119002925.000|TR0|GOVERNMENT ASSN.:  Well, I think, John 
20110119002925.000|20110119002927.000|TR0|that Carol Moseley Braun can rightly say 
20110119002927.000|20110119002929.000|TR0|that her resume suggests a few more 
20110119002929.000|20110119002932.000|TR0|positions.  She was a state senator, a 
20110119002932.000|20110119002934.000|TR0|U.S. senator, an ambassador, recorder of 
20110119002934.000|20110119002936.000|TR0|deeds in Chicago, but remember she 
20110119002936.000|20110119002938.000|TR0|basically had a disastrous single term in 
20110119002938.000|20110119002940.000|TR0|the U.S. Senate and was defeated by a 
20110119002940.000|20110119002942.000|TR0|virtually unknown Republican.
20110119002942.000|20110119002945.000|TR0|
20110119002945.000|20110119002947.000|TR0|I think Bill Clinton's visit today 
20110119002947.000|20110119002949.000|TR0|probably burnishes Emanuel's front runner 
20110119002949.000|20110119002951.000|TR0|status and probably -- basically -- I 
20110119002951.000|20110119002953.000|TR0|think it basically guarantees that Emanuel 
20110119002953.000|20110119002955.000|TR0|makes it into a runoff after February 
20110119002955.000|20110119002957.000|TR0|22nd. The battle now is between Carol and 
20110119002957.000|20110119003000.000|TR0|Gery Chico, the former Chicago school 
20110119003000.000|20110119003002.000|TR0|board president for number two, because 
20110119003002.000|20110119003004.000|TR0|once you get into a runoff, then anything 
20110119003004.000|20110119003006.000|TR0|can happen.
20110119003006.000|20110119003008.000|TR0|
20110119003008.000|20110119003010.000|TR0|There is a strong anti-Rahm sentiment, but 
20110119003010.000|20110119003013.000|TR0|there is also this sense of inevitability, 
20110119003013.000|20110119003015.000|TR0|which is basically promulgated largely by 
20110119003015.000|20110119003017.000|TR0|the media.  On the ground it could be 
20110119003017.000|20110119003019.000|TR0|different.  The voter registration in 
20110119003019.000|20110119003021.000|TR0|black wards in Chicago is up appreciably.  
20110119003021.000|20110119003023.000|TR0|Gery Chico is on the air with a full-blown 
20110119003023.000|20110119003026.000|TR0|ad campaign.  And Rod is in both of their 
20110119003026.000|20110119003028.000|TR0|-- I'm sorry -- Rahm is in both of their 
20110119003028.000|20110119003030.000|TR0|cross-hairs, so even though he is likely 
20110119003030.000|20110119003032.000|TR0|to survive round one, he's certainly not a 
20110119003032.000|20110119003034.000|TR0|cinch to win this race.
20110119003034.000|20110119003036.000|TR0|
20110119003036.000|20110119003039.000|TR0|KING:  And so here's my question, I want 
20110119003039.000|20110119003041.000|TR0|to listen to a bit more of the former 
20110119003041.000|20110119003043.000|TR0|president.  I first met you back then, 
20110119003043.000|20110119003045.000|TR0|Andy, covering campaigns and I remember, I 
20110119003045.000|20110119003047.000|TR0|was covering Bill Clinton.  I worked for 
20110119003047.000|20110119003049.000|TR0|the AP at the time when Rahm Emanuel, he's 
20110119003049.000|20110119003052.000|TR0|a former ballet dancer.  He signed on.  It 
20110119003052.000|20110119003054.000|TR0|was the governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton 
20110119003054.000|20110119003056.000|TR0|was at the time and he needed to know if 
20110119003056.000|20110119003058.000|TR0|he could raise money and he got this fund 
20110119003058.000|20110119003100.000|TR0|raiser from Chicago, Rahm Emanuel.  I want 
20110119003100.000|20110119003102.000|TR0|you to listen to Bill Clinton describing 
20110119003102.000|20110119003104.000|TR0|his relationship with Rahm.

20110119003111.000|20110119003113.000|TR0|CLINTON:  I'm the governor of a small 
20110119003113.000|20110119003115.000|TR0|state and I had a policy of not doing out 
20110119003115.000|20110119003117.000|TR0|of state fund-raisers when I was governor. 
20110119003117.000|20110119003120.000|TR0| And I didn't know if I could raise the 
20110119003120.000|20110119003122.000|TR0|money to run until I met him.  And I 
20110119003122.000|20110119003124.000|TR0|thought finally I met somebody that makes 
20110119003124.000|20110119003126.000|TR0|me look laid back.

20110119003133.000|20110119003135.000|TR0|KING:  Andy, there are some cities where 
20110119003135.000|20110119003137.000|TR0|you would think or some races where you 
20110119003137.000|20110119003139.000|TR0|would think you don't want to have that 
20110119003139.000|20110119003141.000|TR0|reputation as being a volatile guy who 
20110119003141.000|20110119003143.000|TR0|shoots out expletives, who's -- you know 
20110119003143.000|20110119003146.000|TR0|Bill Clinton saying he makes me look laid 
20110119003146.000|20110119003148.000|TR0|back.  But in your city, your city, does 
20110119003148.000|20110119003150.000|TR0|it help that Rahm has this sort of 
20110119003150.000|20110119003152.000|TR0|larger-than-life reputation?       SHAW:  
20110119003152.000|20110119003154.000|TR0|I think in this particular climate it's 
20110119003154.000|20110119003156.000|TR0|extraordinarily helpful because Chicago is 
20110119003156.000|20110119003158.000|TR0|a city in deep crisis, financially in 
20110119003158.000|20110119003201.000|TR0|terms of public safety on the streets, in 
20110119003201.000|20110119003203.000|TR0|the schools.  Remember, the mayor here for 
20110119003203.000|20110119003205.000|TR0|the past 21 years, Richard M. Daley was 
20110119003205.000|20110119003207.000|TR0|hardly a warm and fuzzy individual.  He is 
20110119003207.000|20110119003209.000|TR0|a very volatile, sometimes angry, temper- 
20110119003209.000|20110119003211.000|TR0|ridden individual, and yet he's been an 
20110119003211.000|20110119003214.000|TR0|extraordinarily popular mayor over the 
20110119003214.000|20110119003216.000|TR0|years.
20110119003216.000|20110119003218.000|TR0|
20110119003218.000|20110119003220.000|TR0|I think there's the sense in some areas 
20110119003220.000|20110119003222.000|TR0|that the only way you can tame the beast 
20110119003222.000|20110119003224.000|TR0|of Chicago is with a butt kicker, and 
20110119003224.000|20110119003227.000|TR0|that's Rahm's reputation.  So I think in 
20110119003227.000|20110119003229.000|TR0|this peculiar political environment, his 
20110119003229.000|20110119003231.000|TR0|worst personal attributes, this 
20110119003231.000|20110119003233.000|TR0|volatility, the four-letter words and the 
20110119003233.000|20110119003235.000|TR0|fact that he's not a particularly nice 
20110119003235.000|20110119003237.000|TR0|individual may work to his advantage 
20110119003237.000|20110119003240.000|TR0|because that's what people may be looking 
20110119003240.000|20110119003242.000|TR0|for.
20110119003242.000|20110119003244.000|TR0|
20110119003244.000|20110119003246.000|TR0|MARTIN:  Well that's the mistake his 
20110119003246.000|20110119003248.000|TR0|opponents are making, John, and that is a 
20110119003248.000|20110119003250.000|TR0|lot of the criticism of Daley is that he 
20110119003250.000|20110119003252.000|TR0|ruled with an iron fist.  When you look at 
20110119003252.000|20110119003255.000|TR0|the parking meters deal which people say 
20110119003255.000|20110119003257.000|TR0|was an absolute debacle, they're saying 
20110119003257.000|20110119003259.000|TR0|wait a minute, you have far too much 
20110119003259.000|20110119003301.000|TR0|control.  And so it's interesting, the 
20110119003301.000|20110119003303.000|TR0|argument with Emanuel should not be oh I 
20110119003303.000|20110119003305.000|TR0|have enough experience.  It should be do 
20110119003305.000|20110119003308.000|TR0|you have the temperament to be able to 
20110119003308.000|20110119003310.000|TR0|pull people together to deal with the 
20110119003310.000|20110119003312.000|TR0|budget shortfall in Chicago?  So the 
20110119003312.000|20110119003314.000|TR0|arguments I think that Chico and Braun are 
20110119003314.000|20110119003316.000|TR0|making are absolutely wrong if they really 
20110119003316.000|20110119003318.000|TR0|want to get at the heart of how to beat

20110119003323.000|20110119003325.000|TR0|KING:  It is a fascinating race.  Roland, 
20110119003325.000|20110119003327.000|TR0|Andy, appreciate your time tonight.  We'll 
20110119003327.000|20110119003329.000|TR0|stay in touch as this one goes toward the 
20110119003329.000|20110119003331.000|TR0|finish line.
20110119003331.000|20110119003334.000|TR0|
20110119003334.000|20110119003336.000|TR0|And when we come back, this is a huge 
20110119003336.000|20110119003338.000|TR0|generational challenge. You will deal with 
20110119003338.000|20110119003340.000|TR0|it now and you will deal it probably for 
20110119003340.000|20110119003342.000|TR0|the rest of your life -- the China 
20110119003342.000|20110119003344.000|TR0|challenge.

20110119003351.000|20110119003353.000|TR0|KING:  Just a short time ago, Chinese 
20110119003353.000|20110119003355.000|TR0|President's Hu Jintao's motorcade pulled 
20110119003355.000|20110119003357.000|TR0|up at the White House.   As we speak the 
20110119003357.000|20110119003359.000|TR0|president of China having a private dinner 
20110119003359.000|20110119003402.000|TR0|with the president of the United States. 
20110119003402.000|20110119003404.000|TR0|Vice President Joe Biden was waiting at 
20110119003404.000|20110119003406.000|TR0|the bottom of the stairs when the Chinese 
20110119003406.000|20110119003408.000|TR0|leader arrived at Andrews Air Force base 
20110119003408.000|20110119003410.000|TR0|to begin his state visit.  They'll pull 
20110119003410.000|20110119003412.000|TR0|out all the stops tomorrow.  White House 
20110119003412.000|20110119003415.000|TR0|meetings, a joint news conference, a visit 
20110119003415.000|20110119003417.000|TR0|with U.S. business leaders, a formal state 
20110119003417.000|20110119003419.000|TR0|dinner; amid all this pomp some thorny 
20110119003419.000|20110119003421.000|TR0|issues will be discussed, many.
20110119003421.000|20110119003423.000|TR0|
20110119003423.000|20110119003425.000|TR0|A little bit ago I talked with CNN 
20110119003425.000|20110119003428.000|TR0|Contributor David Gergen who served four 
20110119003428.000|20110119003430.000|TR0|U.S. presidents and watched this 
20110119003430.000|20110119003432.000|TR0|relationship evolve.

20110119003436.000|20110119003438.000|TR0|
20110119003438.000|20110119003441.000|TR0|KING:  So David, I view this as the 
20110119003441.000|20110119003443.000|TR0|defining relationship of the next 
20110119003443.000|20110119003445.000|TR0|generation.  As the president of the 
20110119003445.000|20110119003447.000|TR0|United States sits down tonight for 
20110119003447.000|20110119003449.000|TR0|dinner, and he has the big formal state 
20110119003449.000|20110119003451.000|TR0|dinner tomorrow night.  I'll start with 
20110119003451.000|20110119003453.000|TR0|this irony, you have a Nobel prize winner 
20110119003453.000|20110119003456.000|TR0|sitting across the table from a president 
20110119003456.000|20110119003458.000|TR0|who is holding a Nobel prize winner in 
20110119003458.000|20110119003500.000|TR0|prison, and would not let him go and 
20110119003500.000|20110119003502.000|TR0|accept his award. Starting with human 
20110119003502.000|20110119003504.000|TR0|rights, how tough does the president of 
20110119003504.000|20110119003506.000|TR0|the United States need to be?  And how 
20110119003506.000|20110119003509.000|TR0|risky is it that he be tough with the guy 
20110119003509.000|20110119003511.000|TR0|that essentially is America's banker?
20110119003511.000|20110119003513.000|TR0|
20110119003513.000|20110119003515.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  
20110119003515.000|20110119003517.000|TR0|John, the Chinese are going to be tough.  
20110119003517.000|20110119003519.000|TR0|The president has to be tough in return.  
20110119003519.000|20110119003522.000|TR0|While both of them have to avoid making 
20110119003522.000|20110119003524.000|TR0|the other one the rival and some sort of 
20110119003524.000|20110119003526.000|TR0|enemy.  You're right about this.  This is 
20110119003526.000|20110119003528.000|TR0|the first time a president of the United 
20110119003528.000|20110119003530.000|TR0|States has entertained another head of 
20110119003530.000|20110119003532.000|TR0|state who has got a Nobel prize winner for 
20110119003532.000|20110119003535.000|TR0|peace sitting in jail.  So the president 
20110119003535.000|20110119003537.000|TR0|has to bring up human rights.  He's also 
20110119003537.000|20110119003539.000|TR0|got this large economic agenda where many 
20110119003539.000|20110119003541.000|TR0|in America think we've been wronged.  And 
20110119003541.000|20110119003543.000|TR0|he's got a growing national security 
20110119003543.000|20110119003545.000|TR0|military agenda because China is flexing 
20110119003545.000|20110119003547.000|TR0|its muscles.
20110119003547.000|20110119003550.000|TR0|
20110119003550.000|20110119003552.000|TR0|But the Chinese are coming in with their 
20110119003552.000|20110119003554.000|TR0|demands, too, John. They have many, many 
20110119003554.000|20110119003556.000|TR0|complaints as well.  I think underneath 
20110119003556.000|20110119003558.000|TR0|it's going to be a tough meeting.  I bet 
20110119003558.000|20110119003600.000|TR0|on the surface, they'll paper it over.
20110119003600.000|20110119003603.000|TR0|
20110119003603.000|20110119003605.000|TR0|KING:  And that seems to be the great 
20110119003605.000|20110119003607.000|TR0|disconnect.  Secretary Gates goes to 
20110119003607.000|20110119003609.000|TR0|China.  Secretary Clinton has given a very 
20110119003609.000|20110119003611.000|TR0|assertive speech.  Secretary Geithner 
20110119003611.000|20110119003613.000|TR0|gives a very assertive speech.  On the 
20110119003613.000|20110119003616.000|TR0|military, human rights and economics 
20110119003616.000|20110119003618.000|TR0|issues, the administration says, China, 
20110119003618.000|20110119003620.000|TR0|it's your turn to give.  If you look at 
20110119003620.000|20110119003622.000|TR0|the Chinese media, I'm looking here at 
20110119003622.000|20110119003624.000|TR0|"The Global Times", the state-run 
20110119003624.000|20110119003626.000|TR0|newspaper, affiliated with "The People's 
20110119003626.000|20110119003629.000|TR0|Daily", it says it's the recent activities 
20110119003629.000|20110119003631.000|TR0|by the United States that are causing the 
20110119003631.000|20110119003633.000|TR0|problems, including trying to improve our 
20110119003633.000|20110119003635.000|TR0|relations with South Korea and with Japan. 
20110119003635.000|20110119003637.000|TR0| So they want concessions from us.  We 
20110119003637.000|20110119003639.000|TR0|want concessions from them.  What happens 
20110119003639.000|20110119003642.000|TR0|in the end?
20110119003642.000|20110119003644.000|TR0|
20110119003644.000|20110119003646.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Well, that's what diplomacy is 
20110119003646.000|20110119003648.000|TR0|all about.  You'll are going to have to 
20110119003648.000|20110119003650.000|TR0|make some trades here and you are going to 
20110119003650.000|20110119003652.000|TR0|have to say, look, I will do this if you 
20110119003652.000|20110119003654.000|TR0|will do that.  I think the president may 
20110119003654.000|20110119003657.000|TR0|have enough strength now, political 
20110119003657.000|20110119003659.000|TR0|strength at home that he could make a 
20110119003659.000|20110119003701.000|TR0|couple of concessions.  But I can 
20110119003701.000|20110119003703.000|TR0|guarantee, one of the things he'll come 
20110119003703.000|20110119003705.000|TR0|out, one of the things the United States 
20110119003705.000|20110119003707.000|TR0|will come out of this with is business 
20110119003707.000|20110119003710.000|TR0|people will get more deals in China.  It's 
20110119003710.000|20110119003712.000|TR0|going to sound big, but the amount of 
20110119003712.000|20110119003714.000|TR0|money that's probably involved is tiny, 
20110119003714.000|20110119003716.000|TR0|compared to the trade deficit we have with 
20110119003716.000|20110119003718.000|TR0|China.
20110119003718.000|20110119003720.000|TR0|
20110119003720.000|20110119003723.000|TR0|David, you have served four U.S. 
20110119003723.000|20110119003725.000|TR0|presidents and watched from the outside 
20110119003725.000|20110119003727.000|TR0|with good contacts, several other U.S. 
20110119003727.000|20110119003729.000|TR0|presidents.  Back in the day you started 
20110119003729.000|20110119003731.000|TR0|in government, it was the Cold War, the 
20110119003731.000|20110119003733.000|TR0|Soviet Union, and then the Russians.  Is 
20110119003733.000|20110119003736.000|TR0|this now not the defining security and 
20110119003736.000|20110119003738.000|TR0|economic relationship and in some ways 
20110119003738.000|20110119003740.000|TR0|superpower showdown?
20110119003740.000|20110119003742.000|TR0|
20110119003742.000|20110119003744.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Well, it's become the single most 
20110119003744.000|20110119003746.000|TR0|important bilateral relationship, single 
20110119003746.000|20110119003748.000|TR0|most important country-to-country 
20110119003748.000|20110119003751.000|TR0|relationship in the world, as many have 
20110119003751.000|20110119003753.000|TR0|said.  John, I do think it's going to 
20110119003753.000|20110119003755.000|TR0|define the 21st century, not just this 
20110119003755.000|20110119003757.000|TR0|generation, but much of the 21st century.  
20110119003757.000|20110119003759.000|TR0|What we know is the most dangerous periods 
20110119003759.000|20110119003801.000|TR0|in history is when one country is rising 
20110119003801.000|20110119003804.000|TR0|and another great power is declining.  
20110119003804.000|20110119003806.000|TR0|They often conflict.  As we saw with 
20110119003806.000|20110119003808.000|TR0|Germany and Britain and the United States, 
20110119003808.000|20110119003810.000|TR0|we have seen this before.  What's going to 
20110119003810.000|20110119003812.000|TR0|be really, really important is all these 
20110119003812.000|20110119003814.000|TR0|underlying issues.  But to manage the 
20110119003814.000|20110119003817.000|TR0|relationship in a sensible way that it 
20110119003817.000|20110119003819.000|TR0|doesn't come to blows, it doesn't become a 
20110119003819.000|20110119003821.000|TR0|military rivalry.  And there is some 
20110119003821.000|20110119003823.000|TR0|danger of that. That danger is growing a 
20110119003823.000|20110119003825.000|TR0|little bit.
20110119003825.000|20110119003827.000|TR0|
20110119003827.000|20110119003830.000|TR0|KING:  And the American people seem to get 
20110119003830.000|20110119003832.000|TR0|it.  When I was traveling in the last 
20110119003832.000|20110119003834.000|TR0|campaign, a lot of people talked about the 
20110119003834.000|20110119003836.000|TR0|China challenge and the economic anxiety 
20110119003836.000|20110119003838.000|TR0|and they traced it back to China. Whether 
20110119003838.000|20110119003840.000|TR0|it is the decline of U.S. manufacturing or 
20110119003840.000|20110119003842.000|TR0|even now the rising price of gas, David 
20110119003842.000|20110119003845.000|TR0|Gergen, it is the growth of the Chinese 
20110119003845.000|20110119003847.000|TR0|economy, and the demand of that economy 
20110119003847.000|20110119003849.000|TR0|for crude oil and other crude materials, 
20110119003849.000|20110119003851.000|TR0|raw materials that is in essence driving 
20110119003851.000|20110119003853.000|TR0|our economic condition as well.
20110119003853.000|20110119003855.000|TR0|
20110119003855.000|20110119003858.000|TR0|GERGEN:  That's right.  One of the main 
20110119003858.000|20110119003900.000|TR0|reasons that the gasoline at the pump in 
20110119003900.000|20110119003902.000|TR0|the United States is going up is the 
20110119003902.000|20110119003904.000|TR0|demand by China and other nations in Asia 
20110119003904.000|20110119003906.000|TR0|for more oil and for more gasoline.  The 
20110119003906.000|20110119003908.000|TR0|demand is going up.  It's driving up our 
20110119003908.000|20110119003911.000|TR0|gas prices.  You know what that higher gas 
20110119003911.000|20110119003913.000|TR0|price is for us?  It is a higher tax on 
20110119003913.000|20110119003915.000|TR0|the American income.  So we have some 
20110119003915.000|20110119003917.000|TR0|strong interests here to deal with.  But I 
20110119003917.000|20110119003919.000|TR0|can't -- this is -- this is so important.  
20110119003919.000|20110119003921.000|TR0|We in the media need to be spending a lot 
20110119003921.000|20110119003924.000|TR0|more time understanding China, 
20110119003924.000|20110119003926.000|TR0|understanding the U.S./China relationship 
20110119003926.000|20110119003928.000|TR0|and what we've got at stake.
20110119003928.000|20110119003930.000|TR0|
20110119003930.000|20110119003932.000|TR0|And I do think, John, that this meeting 
20110119003932.000|20110119003934.000|TR0|this week is a prelude to the president's 
20110119003934.000|20110119003936.000|TR0|State of the Union next Tuesday night, 
20110119003936.000|20110119003939.000|TR0|when my expectation is he's going to come 
20110119003939.000|20110119003941.000|TR0|down really four square in terms of 
20110119003941.000|20110119003943.000|TR0|American competitiveness, American 
20110119003943.000|20110119003945.000|TR0|innovation an keeping this a great nation 
20110119003945.000|20110119003947.000|TR0|so we do not go into decline.
20110119003947.000|20110119003949.000|TR0|
20110119003949.000|20110119003952.000|TR0|KING:  It is a fascinating visit and a 
20110119003952.000|20110119003954.000|TR0|fascinating relationship. David Gergen, 
20110119003954.000|20110119003956.000|TR0|appreciate your insight.
20110119003956.000|20110119003958.000|TR0|
20110119003958.000|20110119004000.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Thanks, John.
20110119004000.000|20110119004002.000|TR0|
20110119004002.000|20110119004005.000|TR0|KING:  We'll spend a lot of time on this, 
20110119004005.000|20110119004007.000|TR0|this week.  As the president of China and 
20110119004007.000|20110119004009.000|TR0|the president of United States have their 
20110119004009.000|20110119004011.000|TR0|summit, maybe you're sitting at home 
20110119004011.000|20110119004013.000|TR0|saying why does this matter to me.  Why do 
20110119004013.000|20110119004015.000|TR0|I care?  We'll try to give you reasons to 
20110119004015.000|20110119004018.000|TR0|care all week long.
20110119004018.000|20110119004020.000|TR0|
20110119004020.000|20110119004022.000|TR0|Here is just one tonight.  Look at this, 
20110119004022.000|20110119004024.000|TR0|the blue line, that's the economy of the 
20110119004024.000|20110119004026.000|TR0|United States.  The red line, that's the 
20110119004026.000|20110119004028.000|TR0|economy of China.  Look at this, the 
20110119004028.000|20110119004031.000|TR0|projections now say in 2019 of the 
20110119004031.000|20110119004033.000|TR0|strength of the Chinese economy will pass 
20110119004033.000|20110119004035.000|TR0|that of the U.S. economy.  That's one 
20110119004035.000|20110119004037.000|TR0|reason this is a very important summit.  
20110119004037.000|20110119004039.000|TR0|There are many more.  We'll cover them in 
20110119004039.000|20110119004041.000|TR0|the days ahead.

20110119004048.000|20110119004050.000|TR0|hearing about time and time and time 
20110119004050.000|20110119004052.000|TR0|again.  A city out there in America 
20110119004052.000|20110119004054.000|TR0|cutting vital services, like police 
20110119004054.000|20110119004056.000|TR0|officers because there's little money.

20110119004112.000|20110119004114.000|TR0|JOE JOHNS, CNN NEWS ANCHOR, JOHN KING USA: 
20110119004114.000|20110119004116.000|TR0| And in Camden, New Jersey, which has the 
20110119004116.000|20110119004118.000|TR0|nation's second highest crime rate, the 
20110119004118.000|20110119004120.000|TR0|mayor laid off almost half the police 
20110119004120.000|20110119004122.000|TR0|force and nearly one third of the 
20110119004122.000|20110119004125.000|TR0|firefighters today, blaming her city's 
20110119004125.000|20110119004127.000|TR0|budget deficit.  And looking around the 
20110119004127.000|20110119004129.000|TR0|country, you can't help but wonder whether 
20110119004129.000|20110119004131.000|TR0|this is just a sign of the times for other 
20110119004131.000|20110119004133.000|TR0|American cities.
20110119004133.000|20110119004135.000|TR0|
20110119004135.000|20110119004137.000|TR0|KING:  Great point you make.  Let me walk 
20110119004137.000|20110119004140.000|TR0|over here to show you, Joe.  Because we 
20110119004140.000|20110119004142.000|TR0|have talked about this story in the past 
20110119004142.000|20110119004144.000|TR0|and it is only spreading.  It is not 
20110119004144.000|20110119004146.000|TR0|getting better as states and cities deal 
20110119004146.000|20110119004148.000|TR0|with fiscal crisis.  Here is a map of the 
20110119004148.000|20110119004150.000|TR0|country.  Watch this.  Watch this.  You 
20110119004150.000|20110119004153.000|TR0|talk about Camden police layoffs?  It is 
20110119004153.000|20110119004155.000|TR0|happening everywhere, in cities large and 
20110119004155.000|20110119004157.000|TR0|small.  Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, 
20110119004157.000|20110119004159.000|TR0|California, across Texas, back up the East 
20110119004159.000|20110119004201.000|TR0|Coast, here medium-sized cities, small 
20110119004201.000|20110119004203.000|TR0|cities, large cities, all deal with fiscal 
20110119004203.000|20110119004206.000|TR0|crisis.  No more stimulus money, still a 
20110119004206.000|20110119004208.000|TR0|tough economy.
20110119004208.000|20110119004210.000|TR0|
20110119004210.000|20110119004212.000|TR0|Cities are cutting services.  What are 
20110119004212.000|20110119004214.000|TR0|they cutting?  Let's take a look.  The 
20110119004214.000|20110119004216.000|TR0|orange is the 2010, budget year; the blue 
20110119004216.000|20110119004219.000|TR0|color that is the 2009 budget year.  
20110119004219.000|20110119004221.000|TR0|Personnel cuts, like police.  That is the 
20110119004221.000|20110119004223.000|TR0|big one right there.  Delayed and 
20110119004223.000|20110119004225.000|TR0|cancelled projects, cutting other 
20110119004225.000|20110119004227.000|TR0|services, modifying healthcare benefits, 
20110119004227.000|20110119004229.000|TR0|public safety cuts, again police 
20110119004229.000|20110119004231.000|TR0|department, comes in there.  Across the 
20110119004231.000|20110119004234.000|TR0|board services, renegotiating debts and 
20110119004234.000|20110119004236.000|TR0|pension.  Joe, you see this happening in 
20110119004236.000|20110119004238.000|TR0|states and cities all across the country, 
20110119004238.000|20110119004240.000|TR0|and of course, it is the big debate coming 
20110119004240.000|20110119004242.000|TR0|to Washington right now, as well, what do 
20110119004242.000|20110119004244.000|TR0|you cut?  It is always hard.
20110119004244.000|20110119004247.000|TR0|
20110119004247.000|20110119004249.000|TR0|JOHNS:  Well, yeah.  Well, you know, when 
20110119004249.000|20110119004251.000|TR0|New York had the big storm, and there 
20110119004251.000|20110119004253.000|TR0|weren't enough employees out on the 
20110119004253.000|20110119004255.000|TR0|streets or whatever.  It seemed like that 
20110119004255.000|20110119004257.000|TR0|was just that story all over again. Cities 
20110119004257.000|20110119004300.000|TR0|don't have enough money to work with.
20110119004300.000|20110119004302.000|TR0|

20110119004306.000|20110119004308.000|TR0|Before we go to break, I want to make a 
20110119004308.000|20110119004310.000|TR0|quick point.  We were just having a 
20110119004310.000|20110119004313.000|TR0|discussion about the Chicago mayoral race, 
20110119004313.000|20110119004315.000|TR0|just a moment ago.  My friend Andy Shaw, 
20110119004315.000|20110119004317.000|TR0|who now works for a good government group 
20110119004317.000|20110119004319.000|TR0|out there, used the term "in the 
20110119004319.000|20110119004321.000|TR0|crosshairs" in talking about the 
20110119004321.000|20110119004323.000|TR0|candidates out there.  We're trying-we're 
20110119004323.000|20110119004326.000|TR0|trying to get away from that language.  
20110119004326.000|20110119004328.000|TR0|Andy is a good friend, he's covered 
20110119004328.000|20110119004330.000|TR0|politics for a long time, but we're trying 
20110119004330.000|20110119004332.000|TR0|to get away from using that kind of 
20110119004332.000|20110119004334.000|TR0|language. We won't always be perfect.  So 
20110119004334.000|20110119004336.000|TR0|hold us accountable when we don't meet 
20110119004336.000|20110119004338.000|TR0|your standards.

20110119004345.000|20110119004347.000|TR0|town.  One of the more powerful new

20110119004422.000|20110119004424.000|TR0|of the new health care law.  But there's a 
20110119004424.000|20110119004426.000|TR0|huge generational divide; 57 percent of 
20110119004426.000|20110119004428.000|TR0|Americans 50 and over favor repeal, while 
20110119004428.000|20110119004430.000|TR0|45 percent under 50 favor repeal.

20110119004432.000|20110119004435.000|TR0|One of the key Republicans in this fight 
20110119004435.000|20110119004437.000|TR0|and just about every big fight on Capitol 
20110119004437.000|20110119004439.000|TR0|Hill these days is the Budget Committee 
20110119004439.000|20110119004441.000|TR0|Chairman Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin.

20110119004445.000|20110119004448.000|TR0|
20110119004448.000|20110119004450.000|TR0|KING:  Mr. Chairman, let me ask this 
20110119004450.000|20110119004452.000|TR0|question.  As we all wait to see how this 
20110119004452.000|20110119004454.000|TR0|divided government works, I completely 
20110119004454.000|20110119004456.000|TR0|understand and respect why House 
20110119004456.000|20110119004458.000|TR0|Republicans say we will vote to repeal the 
20110119004458.000|20110119004501.000|TR0|health care bill.  You campaigned on it, 
20110119004501.000|20110119004503.000|TR0|it was a central promise, but you can't do 
20110119004503.000|20110119004505.000|TR0|it.  You can't get it through the Senate.  
20110119004505.000|20110119004507.000|TR0|The president has a veto pen, even if you 
20110119004507.000|20110119004509.000|TR0|could.  What is round two?  Will it just a 
20110119004509.000|20110119004511.000|TR0|continued political confrontation, or will 
20110119004511.000|20110119004514.000|TR0|there be, OK, we can't get our way, let's 
20110119004514.000|20110119004516.000|TR0|have serious conversations with Democrats 
20110119004516.000|20110119004518.000|TR0|about some with incremental changes.
20110119004518.000|20110119004520.000|TR0|
20110119004520.000|20110119004522.000|TR0|REP. PAUL RYAN, CHAIRMAN, BUDGET CMTE.:  
20110119004522.000|20110119004524.000|TR0|Well, if we use that standard to measure 
20110119004524.000|20110119004526.000|TR0|what we do on the House floor, whether we 
20110119004526.000|20110119004529.000|TR0|can pass it out of the House, out of the 
20110119004529.000|20110119004531.000|TR0|Senate and the presidency, they we ought 
20110119004531.000|20110119004533.000|TR0|to just go home.  We do believe it's 
20110119004533.000|20110119004535.000|TR0|incumbent upon us to define ourselves with 
20110119004535.000|20110119004537.000|TR0|our actions.  And that is why, like you 
20110119004537.000|20110119004539.000|TR0|said, this was a campaign pledge.  We're 
20110119004539.000|20110119004542.000|TR0|fulfilling that pledge.  And really do 
20110119004542.000|20110119004544.000|TR0|believe this law should be repealed.  So 
20110119004544.000|20110119004546.000|TR0|going forward with respect to fiscal 
20110119004546.000|20110119004548.000|TR0|policy, I would argue health care policy 
20110119004548.000|20110119004550.000|TR0|is the biggest driver of our debt and 
20110119004550.000|20110119004552.000|TR0|deficits.  I just have a hard time seeing 
20110119004552.000|20110119004555.000|TR0|that we're going to come together on 
20110119004555.000|20110119004557.000|TR0|health care policy.
20110119004557.000|20110119004559.000|TR0|
20110119004559.000|20110119004601.000|TR0|It's because the architecture of the 
20110119004601.000|20110119004603.000|TR0|president's new health care law is so 
20110119004603.000|20110119004605.000|TR0|disastrous from our policy perspective.  
20110119004605.000|20110119004608.000|TR0|It's so wrong that I have a hard time 
20110119004608.000|20110119004610.000|TR0|seeing how we would agree to tinker around 
20110119004610.000|20110119004612.000|TR0|the margins.  We really do believe this 
20110119004612.000|20110119004614.000|TR0|health care system should be replaced with 
20110119004614.000|20110119004616.000|TR0|a patient-centered health care system.  We 
20110119004616.000|20110119004618.000|TR0|believe you can have universal access to 
20110119004618.000|20110119004620.000|TR0|affordable health insurance, including for 
20110119004620.000|20110119004623.000|TR0|people with pre-existing conditions, 
20110119004623.000|20110119004625.000|TR0|without this kind of law takeover, and 
20110119004625.000|20110119004627.000|TR0|without a huge government-run program, 
20110119004627.000|20110119004629.000|TR0|without all these tax increases and 
20110119004629.000|20110119004631.000|TR0|Medicare cuts.
20110119004631.000|20110119004633.000|TR0|
20110119004633.000|20110119004636.000|TR0|Hopefully we can get something on other 
20110119004636.000|20110119004638.000|TR0|areas of fiscal policy. Hopefully on 
20110119004638.000|20110119004640.000|TR0|discretionary spending, other 
20110119004640.000|20110119004642.000|TR0|entitlements, we can get some reform.  My 
20110119004642.000|20110119004644.000|TR0|hope and goal is we can find some 
20110119004644.000|20110119004646.000|TR0|agreement with the president on some 
20110119004646.000|20110119004649.000|TR0|things that to get us in the right 
20110119004649.000|20110119004651.000|TR0|direction, to get this debt under control. 
20110119004651.000|20110119004653.000|TR0| But his health care law, my guess is he's 
20110119004653.000|20110119004655.000|TR0|not going to agree us, and we're not going 
20110119004655.000|20110119004657.000|TR0|to agree with him on that, and that one 
20110119004657.000|20110119004659.000|TR0|might just go to the next election.
20110119004659.000|20110119004702.000|TR0|
20110119004702.000|20110119004704.000|TR0|KING:  All right.  Let's get to those 
20110119004704.000|20110119004706.000|TR0|other issues in a second. You say health 
20110119004706.000|20110119004708.000|TR0|care might go to the next election.  What 
20110119004708.000|20110119004710.000|TR0|about between now and then?  Will you vote 
20110119004710.000|20110119004712.000|TR0|over and over again to repeal?  Or is it 
20110119004712.000|20110119004715.000|TR0|possible we'll get gridlock on the budget 
20110119004715.000|20110119004717.000|TR0|process because a number of your 
20110119004717.000|20110119004719.000|TR0|colleagues said let's defund it.  Let's 
20110119004719.000|20110119004721.000|TR0|deny the funding for what the 
20110119004721.000|20110119004723.000|TR0|administration needs to implement the 
20110119004723.000|20110119004725.000|TR0|healthcare law.  If the house doesn't put 
20110119004725.000|20110119004727.000|TR0|it in its budget, and the Senate does, 
20110119004727.000|20110119004730.000|TR0|then you have gridlock.  You either give 
20110119004730.000|20110119004732.000|TR0|in or what, we don't have a budget, we 
20110119004732.000|20110119004734.000|TR0|shut down the government?
20110119004734.000|20110119004736.000|TR0|
20110119004736.000|20110119004738.000|TR0|RYAN:  Well, so, budget is different than 
20110119004738.000|20110119004740.000|TR0|shutting down government.  These are 
20110119004740.000|20110119004743.000|TR0|different things.  Shutting down 
20110119004743.000|20110119004745.000|TR0|government in your language is 
20110119004745.000|20110119004747.000|TR0|discretionary spending.  And that means do 
20110119004747.000|20110119004749.000|TR0|we put riders in appropriation bills to 
20110119004749.000|20110119004751.000|TR0|defund aspects of this Obama care? And 
20110119004751.000|20110119004753.000|TR0|that those don't get signed into law.  
20110119004753.000|20110119004756.000|TR0|Then we'll see what happens.  I can't 
20110119004756.000|20110119004758.000|TR0|answer what the budget showdown will be on 
20110119004758.000|20110119004800.000|TR0|discretionary spending.
20110119004800.000|20110119004802.000|TR0|
20110119004802.000|20110119004804.000|TR0|But on the budget, which is the budget 
20110119004804.000|20110119004806.000|TR0|resolution, we will be advocating for 
20110119004806.000|20110119004809.000|TR0|repeal of this health care law.  What I'm 
20110119004809.000|20110119004811.000|TR0|trying to say is hopefully there are other 
20110119004811.000|20110119004813.000|TR0|aspects of fiscal reform, maybe in the 
20110119004813.000|20110119004815.000|TR0|area of Medicaid reform, maybe in the area 
20110119004815.000|20110119004817.000|TR0|of Social Security and hopefully maybe in 
20110119004817.000|20110119004819.000|TR0|the area of cutting discretionary 
20110119004819.000|20110119004821.000|TR0|spending.  I would like to think we can 
20110119004821.000|20110119004824.000|TR0|get some agreement in those areas to make 
20110119004824.000|20110119004826.000|TR0|a dent in our problem, even though we have 
20110119004826.000|20110119004828.000|TR0|such a difference of opinion on whether 
20110119004828.000|20110119004830.000|TR0|this new health care law should stand or 
20110119004830.000|20110119004832.000|TR0|not.
20110119004832.000|20110119004834.000|TR0|
20110119004834.000|20110119004837.000|TR0|KING:  Answer the critics, saying you're 
20110119004837.000|20110119004839.000|TR0|trying to change the referee in the middle 
20110119004839.000|20110119004841.000|TR0|of the game.  Or saying you won't listen 
20110119004841.000|20110119004843.000|TR0|to the referee, in the middle of the game.
20110119004843.000|20110119004845.000|TR0|
20110119004845.000|20110119004847.000|TR0|RYAN:  Yeah, the CBO.
20110119004847.000|20110119004850.000|TR0|
20110119004850.000|20110119004852.000|TR0|KING:  Yes, CBO.  You-
20110119004852.000|20110119004854.000|TR0|
20110119004854.000|20110119004856.000|TR0|RYAN:  No.
20110119004856.000|20110119004858.000|TR0|
20110119004858.000|20110119004900.000|TR0|KING:  Sir, you got an award just the 
20110119004900.000|20110119004903.000|TR0|other day, you said, you are doing a great 
20110119004903.000|20110119004905.000|TR0|job at CBO.
20110119004905.000|20110119004907.000|TR0|
20110119004907.000|20110119004909.000|TR0|RYAN:  And they are.
20110119004909.000|20110119004911.000|TR0|
20110119004911.000|20110119004913.000|TR0|KING:  I understand you disagree with the 
20110119004913.000|20110119004915.000|TR0|Democratic bill, you disagree with their 
20110119004915.000|20110119004918.000|TR0|assumptions, but the CBO says the bill 
20110119004918.000|20110119004920.000|TR0|you're about to vote on to repeal the 
20110119004920.000|20110119004922.000|TR0|health care law, would add $230 billion to 
20110119004922.000|20110119004924.000|TR0|the deficit.  They're the referees.  There 
20110119004924.000|20110119004926.000|TR0|are a lot of calls we don't like, we are 
20110119004926.000|20110119004928.000|TR0|both sports fans.
20110119004928.000|20110119004931.000|TR0|
20110119004931.000|20110119004933.000|TR0|RYAN:  Right.
20110119004933.000|20110119004935.000|TR0|
20110119004935.000|20110119004937.000|TR0|KING:  But they are the referees today.  
20110119004937.000|20110119004939.000|TR0|How can you say, never mind?
20110119004939.000|20110119004941.000|TR0|
20110119004941.000|20110119004944.000|TR0|RYAN:  So our quarrel is not with the CBO 
20110119004944.000|20110119004946.000|TR0|at all, or with their methodology.  I 
20110119004946.000|20110119004948.000|TR0|differences of opinion on their 
20110119004948.000|20110119004950.000|TR0|methodology, but our quarrel is not with 
20110119004950.000|20110119004952.000|TR0|CBO themselves, our quarrel is with the 
20110119004952.000|20110119004954.000|TR0|Democrats who wrote the bill that the CBO 
20110119004954.000|20110119004957.000|TR0|had to score.  Here is how the CBO works.  
20110119004957.000|20110119004959.000|TR0|You put in front of them whatever you want 
20110119004959.000|20110119005001.000|TR0|to put in front of them, and they have to 
20110119005001.000|20110119005003.000|TR0|score it.  So, what do they put in front 
20110119005003.000|20110119005005.000|TR0|of them?  They put in front of them a bill 
20110119005005.000|20110119005007.000|TR0|that double counts Medicare money, that 
20110119005007.000|20110119005010.000|TR0|double counts Social Security money, that 
20110119005010.000|20110119005012.000|TR0|double counts class act money, that omits 
20110119005012.000|20110119005014.000|TR0|discretionary spending, that omits the doc 
20110119005014.000|20110119005016.000|TR0|fix.
20110119005016.000|20110119005018.000|TR0|
20110119005018.000|20110119005020.000|TR0|If you take away the double counting, all 
20110119005020.000|20110119005022.000|TR0|the money they didn't count.  It is about 
20110119005022.000|20110119005025.000|TR0|a $700 billion deficit.  The reason I say, 
20110119005025.000|20110119005027.000|TR0|$700 billion deficit is we asked CBO to 
20110119005027.000|20110119005029.000|TR0|look at this bill without all the 
20110119005029.000|20110119005031.000|TR0|gimmicks, without all the smoke and 
20110119005031.000|20110119005033.000|TR0|mirrors.  And that was their conclusion.
20110119005033.000|20110119005035.000|TR0|
20110119005035.000|20110119005038.000|TR0|Let me say it this way, CBO, when they 
20110119005038.000|20110119005040.000|TR0|look at the debt, they can look at 
20110119005040.000|20110119005042.000|TR0|everything, not just this narrow piece of 
20110119005042.000|20110119005044.000|TR0|legislation.  They say this health care 
20110119005044.000|20110119005046.000|TR0|bill increases the debt.  So how can it be 
20110119005046.000|20110119005048.000|TR0|that this legislation reduces the deficit 
20110119005048.000|20110119005051.000|TR0|but increases the debt?  The reason is 
20110119005051.000|20110119005053.000|TR0|because in this bill which is scored, 
20110119005053.000|20110119005055.000|TR0|which gives you that score that you just 
20110119005055.000|20110119005057.000|TR0|mentioned, they have all this double 
20110119005057.000|20110119005059.000|TR0|counting, all these smoke in mirrors.  
20110119005059.000|20110119005101.000|TR0|That's not CBO's problem.  That's the 
20110119005101.000|20110119005104.000|TR0|problem of the people who manipulated CBO 
20110119005104.000|20110119005106.000|TR0|by putting all these budget gimmicks into 
20110119005106.000|20110119005108.000|TR0|the legislation that they have scored.
20110119005108.000|20110119005110.000|TR0|
20110119005110.000|20110119005112.000|TR0|KING:  I suspect Democrats will be saying 
20110119005112.000|20110119005114.000|TR0|the same thing about you in the near 
20110119005114.000|20110119005116.000|TR0|future.  But let's move on to another 
20110119005116.000|20110119005119.000|TR0|issue.  You're making a lot of new 
20110119005119.000|20110119005121.000|TR0|friends.  You have 63 new seats, the House 
20110119005121.000|20110119005123.000|TR0|Republicans picked up in the last 
20110119005123.000|20110119005125.000|TR0|election.  Many of those new members are 
20110119005125.000|20110119005127.000|TR0|Tea Party members, who is say, no way, 
20110119005127.000|20110119005129.000|TR0|sir.  We will not vote to give the 
20110119005129.000|20110119005132.000|TR0|government more lending authority, to 
20110119005132.000|20110119005134.000|TR0|raise the debt ceiling unless they see a 
20110119005134.000|20110119005136.000|TR0|serious and significant package of 
20110119005136.000|20110119005138.000|TR0|spending cuts attached to that legislation.
20110119005138.000|20110119005140.000|TR0|
20110119005140.000|20110119005142.000|TR0|RYAN:  I agree with that.
20110119005142.000|20110119005145.000|TR0|
20110119005145.000|20110119005147.000|TR0|KING:  How much money are we talking about?
20110119005147.000|20110119005149.000|TR0|
20110119005149.000|20110119005151.000|TR0|RYAN:  I'm not interested in negotiating 
20110119005151.000|20110119005153.000|TR0|through the media.  I don't think that's 
20110119005153.000|20110119005155.000|TR0|good strategy.  But we didn't ask the 
20110119005155.000|20110119005158.000|TR0|American people to give us the majority to 
20110119005158.000|20110119005200.000|TR0|be rubber stamps for big government. We do 
20110119005200.000|20110119005202.000|TR0|have to get this thing turned around.  
20110119005202.000|20110119005204.000|TR0|Yes, I think this is an opportunity to get 
20110119005204.000|20110119005206.000|TR0|serious spending cuts and controls in 
20110119005206.000|20110119005208.000|TR0|place in order to prevent default--
20110119005208.000|20110119005210.000|TR0|
20110119005210.000|20110119005213.000|TR0|KING:  How much are we talking about?
20110119005213.000|20110119005215.000|TR0|
20110119005215.000|20110119005217.000|TR0|RYAN:  I'm not going to get into that 
20110119005217.000|20110119005219.000|TR0|because I don't think it's smart to 
20110119005219.000|20110119005221.000|TR0|negotiate through the media.  But we want 
20110119005221.000|20110119005223.000|TR0|something significant because this debt 
20110119005223.000|20110119005226.000|TR0|situation is really getting out of 
20110119005226.000|20110119005228.000|TR0|control.  And we're not interested in 
20110119005228.000|20110119005230.000|TR0|rubber stamping all the spending that's 
20110119005230.000|20110119005232.000|TR0|taken place over the last two years.  We 
20110119005232.000|20110119005234.000|TR0|want to get this thing turned around in 
20110119005234.000|20110119005236.000|TR0|the right direction.
20110119005236.000|20110119005239.000|TR0|
20110119005239.000|20110119005241.000|TR0|KING:  I hope we spend a lot of time in 
20110119005241.000|20110119005243.000|TR0|the weeks and months to come, deep in the 
20110119005243.000|20110119005245.000|TR0|leaves (ph) of the budget.  And I mean 
20110119005245.000|20110119005247.000|TR0|that, going through specific programs -
20110119005247.000|20110119005249.000|TR0|
20110119005249.000|20110119005252.000|TR0|RYAN:  I'd love to.
20110119005252.000|20110119005254.000|TR0|
20110119005254.000|20110119005256.000|TR0|KING:  How this is going to affect.  But I 
20110119005256.000|20110119005258.000|TR0|want to close today by asking this 
20110119005258.000|20110119005300.000|TR0|question:  You won't give me the number of 
20110119005300.000|20110119005302.000|TR0|spending cuts you want to attached to 
20110119005302.000|20110119005304.000|TR0|raising the debt ceiling.  What about, has 
20110119005304.000|20110119005307.000|TR0|the climate changed at all?  You said you 
20110119005307.000|20110119005309.000|TR0|hope to agree with the president on many 
20110119005309.000|20110119005311.000|TR0|of these things.  As we know you didn't 
20110119005311.000|20110119005313.000|TR0|have any conversations with the president 
20110119005313.000|20110119005315.000|TR0|the first two years.  Are you already in 
20110119005315.000|20110119005317.000|TR0|contact with the administration?  Are you 
20110119005317.000|20110119005320.000|TR0|trying to work some of these things out?  
20110119005320.000|20110119005322.000|TR0|Or are we going to do this the 
20110119005322.000|20110119005324.000|TR0|old-fashioned way?  Republicans have a 
20110119005324.000|20110119005326.000|TR0|proposal, you have your vote, the Senate 
20110119005326.000|20110119005328.000|TR0|Democrats have a proposal, they have their 
20110119005328.000|20110119005330.000|TR0|votes and it takes months and months to 
20110119005330.000|20110119005333.000|TR0|get to what we know is going to have in 
20110119005333.000|20110119005335.000|TR0|the end, you will have to get in the room, 
20110119005335.000|20110119005337.000|TR0|with the president, with the Democrats on 
20110119005337.000|20110119005339.000|TR0|the Senate side, and cut some sort of deal?
20110119005339.000|20110119005341.000|TR0|
20110119005341.000|20110119005343.000|TR0|RYAN:  The people I knew in the 
20110119005343.000|20110119005346.000|TR0|administration, Larry Summers, Peter 
20110119005346.000|20110119005348.000|TR0|Orszag, Rahm Emanuel, they're gone.  
20110119005348.000|20110119005350.000|TR0|There's new people from the fiscal 
20110119005350.000|20110119005352.000|TR0|standpoint.  I'm just beginning to get to 
20110119005352.000|20110119005354.000|TR0|know them.  I did reach out to Jack Lew, 
20110119005354.000|20110119005356.000|TR0|the new OMB director.  We have gotten to 
20110119005356.000|20110119005359.000|TR0|know each other a little bit.  Gene 
20110119005359.000|20110119005401.000|TR0|Sperling was kind enough to call me to 
20110119005401.000|20110119005403.000|TR0|talk.  And I'm getting to know Tim 
20110119005403.000|20110119005405.000|TR0|Geithner a little bit.  So we are having 
20110119005405.000|20110119005407.000|TR0|those preliminary conversations.  Nothing 
20110119005407.000|20110119005409.000|TR0|but good things come out of those from my 
20110119005409.000|20110119005411.000|TR0|perspective.
20110119005411.000|20110119005414.000|TR0|
20110119005414.000|20110119005416.000|TR0|So, yes, look, I don't want to do nothing 
20110119005416.000|20110119005418.000|TR0|for the next two years. I hope what is 
20110119005418.000|20110119005420.000|TR0|going to happen is the president is going 
20110119005420.000|20110119005422.000|TR0|to say, I agree with you Republicans on A, 
20110119005422.000|20110119005424.000|TR0|B and C, let's get those things done. But 
20110119005424.000|20110119005427.000|TR0|an X, Y and Z, and his healthcare bill is 
20110119005427.000|20110119005429.000|TR0|probably one of them, we'll have to agree 
20110119005429.000|20110119005431.000|TR0|to disagree.  And that's fine.  That is 
20110119005431.000|20110119005433.000|TR0|just how it is going to go.  But I do 
20110119005433.000|20110119005435.000|TR0|believe for the sake of our country, for 
20110119005435.000|20110119005437.000|TR0|the sake of our debt situation, that we're 
20110119005437.000|20110119005440.000|TR0|going to make some good dents on spending. 
20110119005440.000|20110119005442.000|TR0| Spending, after all, is the source of our 
20110119005442.000|20110119005444.000|TR0|problem, we have to get started on it.
20110119005444.000|20110119005446.000|TR0|
20110119005446.000|20110119005448.000|TR0|KING:  Paul Ryan, chairman of the House 
20110119005448.000|20110119005450.000|TR0|Budget Committee, one of the most powerful 
20110119005450.000|20110119005453.000|TR0|figures in Washington at the moment.  I 
20110119005453.000|20110119005455.000|TR0|hope you have those grown-up conversations 
20110119005455.000|20110119005457.000|TR0|as you just described.  And we'll keep in 
20110119005457.000|20110119005459.000|TR0|touch as we go forward.
20110119005459.000|20110119005501.000|TR0|
20110119005501.000|20110119005503.000|TR0|RYAN:  Thanks, John.  Nice to be with you.
20110119005503.000|20110119005505.000|TR0|
20110119005505.000|20110119005508.000|TR0|KING:  Mr. Chairman, thank you.

20110119005510.000|20110119005512.000|TR0|So what's got Pete so jumpy tonight?  Oh, 
20110119005512.000|20110119005514.000|TR0|no.  He's not on the caffeine again, is he?

20110119005521.000|20110119005523.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110119005523.000|20110119005525.000|TR0|
20110119005525.000|20110119005527.000|TR0|KING:  I'll confess, I'm a big coffee fan. 
20110119005527.000|20110119005529.000|TR0| I think the technical term is addict.  
20110119005529.000|20110119005531.000|TR0|But our OffBeat Reporter Pete Dominick, 
20110119005531.000|20110119005534.000|TR0|well, he is you might say boiling mad over 
20110119005534.000|20110119005536.000|TR0|Starbucks' new 31-ounce cup called trenta.
20110119005536.000|20110119005538.000|TR0|
20110119005538.000|20110119005540.000|TR0|Ha, finally!
20110119005540.000|20110119005542.000|TR0|
20110119005542.000|20110119005544.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Oh, John King, I am absolutely 
20110119005544.000|20110119005547.000|TR0|outraged.  I too like my coffee.  But 
20110119005547.000|20110119005549.000|TR0|where does it end, John King?  Where does 
20110119005549.000|20110119005551.000|TR0|it end? Today Starbucks introduced their 
20110119005551.000|20110119005553.000|TR0|new Trenta size.
20110119005553.000|20110119005555.000|TR0|
20110119005555.000|20110119005557.000|TR0|John, I have the venti.  This is their 
20110119005557.000|20110119005559.000|TR0|largest size right now. But today they 
20110119005559.000|20110119005602.000|TR0|introduced the trenti, which is 10 ounces 
20110119005602.000|20110119005604.000|TR0|too big. John King, do you know what 
20110119005604.000|20110119005606.000|TR0|trenta translates into in Italian?
20110119005606.000|20110119005608.000|TR0|
20110119005608.000|20110119005610.000|TR0|KING:  Tell me.
20110119005610.000|20110119005612.000|TR0|
20110119005612.000|20110119005615.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  It translates into too much 
20110119005615.000|20110119005617.000|TR0|coffee in your stomach at one time.
20110119005617.000|20110119005619.000|TR0|
20110119005619.000|20110119005621.000|TR0|KING:  No it doesn't.
20110119005621.000|20110119005623.000|TR0|
20110119005623.000|20110119005625.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Enough, John.  We have an 
20110119005625.000|20110119005628.000|TR0|addiction in this country to work and to 
20110119005628.000|20110119005630.000|TR0|energy.  Where does it end?  My daughters 
20110119005630.000|20110119005632.000|TR0|are six and three years old.  I'm afraid 
20110119005632.000|20110119005634.000|TR0|when they enter the workforce, this is 
20110119005634.000|20110119005636.000|TR0|going to be them, John King.  This is what 
20110119005636.000|20110119005638.000|TR0|you would call a noventa, and it has a 
20110119005638.000|20110119005641.000|TR0|carrying strap and everything.  They're 
20110119005641.000|20110119005643.000|TR0|just going to carry this around on them.  
20110119005643.000|20110119005645.000|TR0|This is the future of America.
20110119005645.000|20110119005647.000|TR0|
20110119005647.000|20110119005649.000|TR0|I say, John King, where does it end?  
20110119005649.000|20110119005651.000|TR0|That's the debate I'd like to see you have 
20110119005651.000|20110119005654.000|TR0|on JOHN KING USA tomorrow night.  How much 
20110119005654.000|20110119005656.000|TR0|caffeine is too much?
20110119005656.000|20110119005658.000|TR0|
20110119005658.000|20110119005700.000|TR0|KING:  We'll have that debate.  I'm going 
20110119005700.000|20110119005702.000|TR0|to send you first, a little English to 
20110119005702.000|20110119005704.000|TR0|Italian dictionary.  See if you can get 
20110119005704.000|20110119005706.000|TR0|trenta.  See if we can get you up to 30.
20110119005706.000|20110119005709.000|TR0|
20110119005709.000|20110119005711.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Right.
20110119005711.000|20110119005713.000|TR0|
20110119005713.000|20110119005715.000|TR0|KING:  How do you drink your coffee?
20110119005715.000|20110119005717.000|TR0|
20110119005717.000|20110119005719.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  John King, I drink my coffee as 
20110119005719.000|20110119005722.000|TR0|lame and mild as I possibly can be.  It 
20110119005722.000|20110119005724.000|TR0|represents my own personality.  But I 
20110119005724.000|20110119005726.000|TR0|don't drink a bucket of it.
20110119005726.000|20110119005728.000|TR0|
20110119005728.000|20110119005730.000|TR0|KING:  What do you mean?  Whoa, whoa, what 
20110119005730.000|20110119005732.000|TR0|do you mean?  You mean like, a lot of milk 
20110119005732.000|20110119005735.000|TR0|and the sweeteners, and everything else?  
20110119005735.000|20110119005737.000|TR0|Do you get froufrou drinks or real drinks?
20110119005737.000|20110119005739.000|TR0|
20110119005739.000|20110119005741.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  I don't get a froufrou drink.  
20110119005741.000|20110119005743.000|TR0|Although, I do use quite a bit of 
20110119005743.000|20110119005745.000|TR0|half-and-half and lots of sugar.  I'm not 
20110119005745.000|20110119005748.000|TR0|exactly a black coffee drinker myself, 
20110119005748.000|20110119005750.000|TR0|John.
20110119005750.000|20110119005752.000|TR0|
20110119005752.000|20110119005754.000|TR0|KING:  Oh.
20110119005754.000|20110119005756.000|TR0|
20110119005756.000|20110119005758.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  How do you drink yours?
20110119005758.000|20110119005800.000|TR0|
20110119005800.000|20110119005803.000|TR0|KING:  How do I drink mine?  I either do 
20110119005803.000|20110119005805.000|TR0|espresso shots.  I have a nice little 
20110119005805.000|20110119005807.000|TR0|espresso maker in my office.  It is a 
20110119005807.000|20110119005809.000|TR0|great thing.  Or I get what we call, do 
20110119005809.000|20110119005811.000|TR0|you know what an Americano is?
20110119005811.000|20110119005813.000|TR0|
20110119005813.000|20110119005816.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  That is an American espresso.
20110119005816.000|20110119005818.000|TR0|
20110119005818.000|20110119005820.000|TR0|KING:  Espresso and a little hot water in 
20110119005820.000|20110119005822.000|TR0|there, just a little hot water.
20110119005822.000|20110119005824.000|TR0|
20110119005824.000|20110119005826.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  You gave me an espresso in our 
20110119005826.000|20110119005829.000|TR0|office one time. John--
20110119005829.000|20110119005831.000|TR0|
20110119005831.000|20110119005833.000|TR0|KING:  That was back when I was being nice 
20110119005833.000|20110119005835.000|TR0|to you.      DOMINICK:  Back to -- I want 
20110119005835.000|20110119005837.000|TR0|another one of those.
20110119005837.000|20110119005839.000|TR0|
20110119005839.000|20110119005842.000|TR0|Back to politics for a second, the 
20110119005842.000|20110119005844.000|TR0|question of the day for me is, will Joe 
20110119005844.000|20110119005846.000|TR0|Lieberman, now that he's leaving, will he 
20110119005846.000|20110119005848.000|TR0|get a job in the private sector?
20110119005848.000|20110119005850.000|TR0|
20110119005850.000|20110119005852.000|TR0|KING:  In the private sector, if he wants, 
20110119005852.000|20110119005854.000|TR0|there will be many opportunities for him.  
20110119005854.000|20110119005857.000|TR0|My big question is whether the Obama 
20110119005857.000|20110119005859.000|TR0|administration would reach out to him.  
20110119005859.000|20110119005901.000|TR0|Since he is staying in the Senate through 
20110119005901.000|20110119005903.000|TR0|the end of 2012. I suspect if he runs his 
20110119005903.000|20110119005905.000|TR0|term out, then it depends on who wins the 
20110119005905.000|20110119005907.000|TR0|next presidential election.
20110119005907.000|20110119005910.000|TR0|
20110119005910.000|20110119005912.000|TR0|Look, it is an interesting time.  He's an 
20110119005912.000|20110119005914.000|TR0|interesting guy.  Tough choice for him to 
20110119005914.000|20110119005916.000|TR0|make.  He's been at the middle of some big 
20110119005916.000|20110119005918.000|TR0|debates. I don't think he would drink 
20110119005918.000|20110119005920.000|TR0|coffee out of one of those.
20110119005920.000|20110119005923.000|TR0|
20110119005923.000|20110119005925.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  I have to get going.  My strap 
20110119005925.000|20110119005927.000|TR0|just broke.
20110119005927.000|20110119005929.000|TR0|
20110119005929.000|20110119005931.000|TR0|KING:  Yeah, OK.
20110119005931.000|20110119005933.000|TR0|
20110119005933.000|20110119005936.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  This is it, John King.
20110119005936.000|20110119005938.000|TR0|
20110119005938.000|20110119005940.000|TR0|KING:  Espresso on me.  Peter Dominick, 
20110119005940.000|20110119005942.000|TR0|we'll see you tomorrow. That's all for us. 
20110119005942.000|20110119005944.000|TR0| We hope to see you tomorrow right here.  
20110119005944.000|20110119005946.000|TR0|PARKER SPITZER starts right now.
20110119005946.000|20110119005948.000|TR0|
