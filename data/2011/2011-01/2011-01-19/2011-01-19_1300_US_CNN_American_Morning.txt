20110119130020.000|20110119130022.000|TR0|KIRAN CHETRY, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm Kiran 
20110119130022.000|20110119130025.000|TR0|Chetry.  We have a lot to talk about this 
20110119130025.000|20110119130027.000|TR0|morning, including some new news on the 
20110119130027.000|20110119130029.000|TR0|condition of Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110119130029.000|20110119130031.000|TR0|Giffords that we're going to get to in 
20110119130031.000|20110119130034.000|TR0|just a second.
20110119130034.000|20110119130036.000|TR0|
20110119130036.000|20110119130038.000|TR0|First of all, though, there is word that 
20110119130038.000|20110119130041.000|TR0|the shooting in Tucson was captured on 
20110119130041.000|20110119130043.000|TR0|tape, that every agonizing minute was 
20110119130043.000|20110119130045.000|TR0|captured by the surveillance cameras, 
20110119130045.000|20110119130047.000|TR0|nearly two dozen of them outside of the 
20110119130047.000|20110119130050.000|TR0|Safeway store, shedding new light on the 
20110119130050.000|20110119130052.000|TR0|suspected gunman and his actions that day.
20110119130052.000|20110119130054.000|TR0|
20110119130054.000|20110119130056.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Also they're going to be talking 
20110119130056.000|20110119130059.000|TR0|about you (sic) today -- Hu -- yes, that 
20110119130059.000|20110119130101.000|TR0|Hu.  President Hu of China is going to be 
20110119130101.000|20110119130103.000|TR0|sitting down with President Obama.  A long 
20110119130103.000|20110119130105.000|TR0|list of things to talk about these two 
20110119130105.000|20110119130108.000|TR0|super powers and, of course, a big state 
20110119130108.000|20110119130110.000|TR0|dinner tonight.  We'll tell you what's 
20110119130110.000|20110119130112.000|TR0|happening today and how their 
20110119130112.000|20110119130115.000|TR0|conversations could impact you.
20110119130115.000|20110119130117.000|TR0|
20110119130117.000|20110119130119.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Also the golden child of the big 
20110119130119.000|20110119130121.000|TR0|banks -- Goldman Sachs. They're set to 
20110119130121.000|20110119130124.000|TR0|release earnings from the last quarter and 
20110119130124.000|20110119130126.000|TR0|this could give us a significant glimpse 
20110119130126.000|20110119130128.000|TR0|into the health of our nation's banks and 
20110119130128.000|20110119130130.000|TR0|also bonus season.

20110119130135.000|20110119130137.000|TR0|
20110119130137.000|20110119130139.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And we are getting, and as you 
20110119130139.000|20110119130142.000|TR0|know, continuing to get updates, seem like 
20110119130142.000|20110119130144.000|TR0|remarkable updates every single day about 
20110119130144.000|20110119130146.000|TR0|the condition of Gabrielle Giffords and 
20110119130146.000|20110119130149.000|TR0|her recovery, the congresswoman. We are 
20110119130149.000|20110119130151.000|TR0|getting word now from her parents, just 
20110119130151.000|20110119130153.000|TR0|getting an e-mail obtained here by CNN 
20110119130153.000|20110119130155.000|TR0|from her parents.
20110119130155.000|20110119130158.000|TR0|
20110119130158.000|20110119130200.000|TR0|I'm trying through it here.  Kiran and I 
20110119130200.000|20110119130202.000|TR0|both are getting this into our inboxes and 
20110119130202.000|20110119130204.000|TR0|we're reading through it.  But something 
20110119130204.000|20110119130207.000|TR0|that stands out here is that she is 
20110119130207.000|20110119130209.000|TR0|actually going to be going to a rehab 
20110119130209.000|20110119130211.000|TR0|facility on Friday.
20110119130211.000|20110119130213.000|TR0|
20110119130213.000|20110119130216.000|TR0|Let me just -- we got it right here in 
20110119130216.000|20110119130218.000|TR0|front of me.  It says, there is a team -- 
20110119130218.000|20110119130220.000|TR0|now, I'm directly quoting here.  It says, 
20110119130220.000|20110119130223.000|TR0|"There is a team of medical specialists 
20110119130223.000|20110119130225.000|TR0|involved, including military surgeons who 
20110119130225.000|20110119130227.000|TR0|specialize in bullet wounds to the head."  
20110119130227.000|20110119130229.000|TR0|They want to start aggressive rehab 
20110119130229.000|20110119130232.000|TR0|immediately and are flying her to Houston 
20110119130232.000|20110119130234.000|TR0|facilities on Friday.  "I'll go with her, 
20110119130234.000|20110119130236.000|TR0|along with Mark and the Dr. Rhee" and see 
20110119130236.000|20110119130238.000|TR0|where they can fit into the rehab process.
20110119130238.000|20110119130241.000|TR0|
20110119130241.000|20110119130243.000|TR0|But the word here, we heard from the 
20110119130243.000|20110119130245.000|TR0|doctors just the other day that I think it 
20110119130245.000|20110119130247.000|TR0|might have been yesterday even, or the day 
20110119130247.000|20110119130250.000|TR0|before, and everybody was amazed saying 
20110119130250.000|20110119130252.000|TR0|she could be released.  Not going home but 
20110119130252.000|20110119130254.000|TR0|released from the hospital and could be 
20110119130254.000|20110119130257.000|TR0|going to a rehab facility in a matter of 
20110119130257.000|20110119130259.000|TR0|weeks or a matter of days.
20110119130259.000|20110119130301.000|TR0|
20110119130301.000|20110119130303.000|TR0|According to this e-mail, it sounds like 
20110119130303.000|20110119130306.000|TR0|she will be released --
20110119130306.000|20110119130308.000|TR0|
20110119130308.000|20110119130310.000|TR0|CHETRY:  This week.
20110119130310.000|20110119130312.000|TR0|
20110119130312.000|20110119130315.000|TR0|HOLMES:  -- from the hospital and going to 
20110119130315.000|20110119130317.000|TR0|a rehab facility in Houston.
20110119130317.000|20110119130319.000|TR0|
20110119130319.000|20110119130321.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Right.  So, that will be two 
20110119130321.000|20110119130324.000|TR0|weeks after the shooting.
20110119130324.000|20110119130326.000|TR0|
20110119130326.000|20110119130328.000|TR0|HOLMES:  After the shooting.
20110119130328.000|20110119130331.000|TR0|
20110119130331.000|20110119130333.000|TR0|CHETRY:  After that potentially 
20110119130333.000|20110119130335.000|TR0|life-altering injury that she had.  And 
20110119130335.000|20110119130337.000|TR0|also, just to be able to be healthy for 
20110119130337.000|20110119130340.000|TR0|them to have the confidence she can travel 
20110119130340.000|20110119130342.000|TR0|because that's no easy feat to transport 
20110119130342.000|20110119130344.000|TR0|her in light of what injury she suffered.
20110119130344.000|20110119130346.000|TR0|
20110119130346.000|20110119130349.000|TR0|So, again, that's from her mother.  This 
20110119130349.000|20110119130351.000|TR0|news that she's going to a rehab facility 
20110119130351.000|20110119130353.000|TR0|in Houston to begin aggressive 
20110119130353.000|20110119130355.000|TR0|rehabilitation. Wonderful news.
20110119130355.000|20110119130358.000|TR0|
20110119130358.000|20110119130400.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Wonderful news there.  We're 
20110119130400.000|20110119130402.000|TR0|going to continue to read through this and 
20110119130402.000|20110119130405.000|TR0|pull out some more bits and bites that you 
20110119130405.000|20110119130407.000|TR0|need to be hearing about.  So, stay with 
20110119130407.000|20110119130409.000|TR0|us for more on that.
20110119130409.000|20110119130411.000|TR0|
20110119130411.000|20110119130414.000|TR0|Meanwhile, more on the Tucson shooting.  
20110119130414.000|20110119130416.000|TR0|There is word now that it was caught on 
20110119130416.000|20110119130418.000|TR0|tape, surveillance tape in Tucson.  We 
20110119130418.000|20110119130420.000|TR0|don't have it to show to you just yet and 
20110119130420.000|20110119130423.000|TR0|don't know if we will once we eventually 
20110119130423.000|20110119130425.000|TR0|do see it, once members of the press do 
20110119130425.000|20110119130427.000|TR0|see it.  But "The Washington Post" 
20110119130427.000|20110119130429.000|TR0|reporting they have spoken to people who 
20110119130429.000|20110119130432.000|TR0|actually have seen the video and according 
20110119130432.000|20110119130434.000|TR0|to these sources, it does show the alleged 
20110119130434.000|20110119130436.000|TR0|gunman walking out of the Safeway store 
20110119130436.000|20110119130439.000|TR0|and walking up to Gabrielle Giffords and 
20110119130439.000|20110119130441.000|TR0|shooting her first at close range.
20110119130441.000|20110119130443.000|TR0|
20110119130443.000|20110119130445.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Also, according to the reporting 
20110119130445.000|20110119130448.000|TR0|from "The Washington Post," the video also 
20110119130448.000|20110119130450.000|TR0|shows Judge John Roll getting shot in the 
20110119130450.000|20110119130452.000|TR0|back while attempting to shield one of 
20110119130452.000|20110119130454.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords staffers, Ron Barber.  
20110119130454.000|20110119130457.000|TR0|Barber had been shot twice.  He survived 
20110119130457.000|20110119130459.000|TR0|and, sadly, Judge Roll did not.
20110119130459.000|20110119130501.000|TR0|
20110119130501.000|20110119130503.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Also, Christina Green, a lot of 
20110119130503.000|20110119130506.000|TR0|people familiar with her story now.  The 
20110119130506.000|20110119130508.000|TR0|9-year-old who was there, you know, just 
20110119130508.000|20110119130510.000|TR0|trying to see her hero, the congresswoman, 
20110119130510.000|20110119130513.000|TR0|ended up being shot and being killed. 
20110119130513.000|20110119130515.000|TR0|Well, her father is speaking out now and 
20110119130515.000|20110119130517.000|TR0|telling us that his daughter helped save 
20110119130517.000|20110119130519.000|TR0|the eyesight of two children.  John Green 
20110119130519.000|20110119130522.000|TR0|is his name.
20110119130522.000|20110119130524.000|TR0|
20110119130524.000|20110119130526.000|TR0|He was talking in an interview and also 
20110119130526.000|20110119130528.000|TR0|talking about the alleged gunman, Jared 
20110119130528.000|20110119130531.000|TR0|Loughner, saying he does not want to even 
20110119130531.000|20110119130533.000|TR0|waste his time on that guy.  Take a listen 
20110119130533.000|20110119130535.000|TR0|here.

20110119130618.000|20110119130621.000|TR0|so active, as he remembers her.  He says 
20110119130621.000|20110119130623.000|TR0|actually tissue -- some of her tissue was 
20110119130623.000|20110119130625.000|TR0|frozen, maybe it could be used down the 
20110119130625.000|20110119130627.000|TR0|road to help other kids, possibly who 
20110119130627.000|20110119130630.000|TR0|can't walk or run.  Tissue was taken from 
20110119130630.000|20110119130632.000|TR0|her knees.  So, even in death, this young

20110119130639.000|20110119130641.000|TR0|the ordeal that he's been through.  
20110119130641.000|20110119130643.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford's husband 
20110119130643.000|20110119130646.000|TR0|saying that he feels -- that he had a 
20110119130646.000|20110119130648.000|TR0|feeling that something like this would 
20110119130648.000|20110119130650.000|TR0|happen, and that his wife actually talked 
20110119130650.000|20110119130652.000|TR0|about that as well, that she may have 
20110119130652.000|20110119130655.000|TR0|actually predicted it.  But she told him 
20110119130655.000|20110119130657.000|TR0|on several occasions that she was fearful 
20110119130657.000|20110119130659.000|TR0|that she might get shot when she was out 
20110119130659.000|20110119130701.000|TR0|in public.

20110119130708.000|20110119130710.000|TR0|about what to tell her about what happened.

20110119130720.000|20110119130722.000|TR0|was talking to one of her other 
20110119130722.000|20110119130724.000|TR0|constituents, that she leaned down next to 
20110119130724.000|20110119130726.000|TR0|her and said -- said, you know, someday, 
20110119130726.000|20110119130729.000|TR0|you know, you could grow up and be like 
20110119130729.000|20110119130731.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords, and those were the 
20110119130731.000|20110119130733.000|TR0|last words she heard.  So, you know, it's 
20110119130733.000|20110119130735.000|TR0|just -- I mean, you just can't explain it.

20110119130738.000|20110119130740.000|TR0|You know, it's going to be one of the

20110119130744.000|20110119130747.000|TR0|mean, that's going to be a hard, hard 
20110119130747.000|20110119130749.000|TR0|thing to do.  You know, that Ron Barber 
20110119130749.000|20110119130751.000|TR0|almost lost his life, that Pam Simon.  I 
20110119130751.000|20110119130754.000|TR0|mean, some -- I mean, it's a miracle she 
20110119130754.000|20110119130756.000|TR0|survived.  She really truly loves these

20110119130800.000|20110119130803.000|TR0|I mean, how do I explain to her that it 
20110119130803.000|20110119130805.000|TR0|was a 9-year-old girl that was standing in 
20110119130805.000|20110119130807.000|TR0|front of you, you know, looking up to you, 
20110119130807.000|20110119130809.000|TR0|you know, and now she's gone, too -- and 
20110119130809.000|20110119130812.000|TR0|all of the others.  And when do you do 
20110119130812.000|20110119130814.000|TR0|that?  I mean, I could do it now.  I don't 
20110119130814.000|20110119130816.000|TR0|know if that's the right thing to do.

20110119130818.000|20110119130821.000|TR0|I decided it isn't.  I mean, I have to -- 
20110119130821.000|20110119130823.000|TR0|I have to wait for the appropriate time.

20110119130902.000|20110119130904.000|TR0|Elementary School.  I was looking at a 
20110119130904.000|20110119130906.000|TR0|whole giant bag of them today, or 
20110119130906.000|20110119130908.000|TR0|yesterday.  And one kid had a little card 
20110119130908.000|20110119130911.000|TR0|and on the back of his card was an

20110119130913.000|20110119130915.000|TR0|and in the envelope was his lunch money.  
20110119130915.000|20110119130917.000|TR0|It was like $2.85.

20110119131037.000|20110119131039.000|TR0|questions about can she see and is she 
20110119131039.000|20110119131041.000|TR0|going to be doing OK?

20110119131059.000|20110119131102.000|TR0|the top button of his shirt and also she

20110119131140.000|20110119131142.000|TR0|morning.  The FBI is looking for a person 
20110119131142.000|20110119131145.000|TR0|who planted a backpack bomb along the 
20110119131145.000|20110119131147.000|TR0|Martin Luther King Day parade in Spokane, 
20110119131147.000|20110119131149.000|TR0|Washington, along that route.  The Feds 
20110119131149.000|20110119131152.000|TR0|say that three parade workers found the 
20110119131152.000|20110119131154.000|TR0|explosive device on Monday morning.  They 
20110119131154.000|20110119131156.000|TR0|also say that it could have injured a lot 
20110119131156.000|20110119131158.000|TR0|of people.
20110119131158.000|20110119131201.000|TR0|
20110119131201.000|20110119131203.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Also, take a look at this in 
20110119131203.000|20110119131205.000|TR0|Philadelphia.  This is the aftermath of 
20110119131205.000|20110119131207.000|TR0|what happened.  This is a fireball you see 
20110119131207.000|20110119131210.000|TR0|there after a gas line explosion and it 
20110119131210.000|20110119131212.000|TR0|was caught on tape.  Watch and listen now.

20110119131219.000|20110119131221.000|TR0|HOLMES:  One person was killed here.  
20110119131221.000|20110119131223.000|TR0|Another five injured.  Some of them 
20110119131223.000|20110119131226.000|TR0|injured seriously.  Also, 15 to 20 
20110119131226.000|20110119131228.000|TR0|families are displaced right now.

20110119131230.000|20110119131232.000|TR0|CHETRY:  We get a quick check in the 
20110119131232.000|20110119131235.000|TR0|morning weather headlines right now.
20110119131235.000|20110119131237.000|TR0|
20110119131237.000|20110119131239.000|TR0|Our Rob is live in Steamboat Springs.
20110119131239.000|20110119131241.000|TR0|
20110119131241.000|20110119131244.000|TR0|And, you have a beautiful backdrop.  I 
20110119131244.000|20110119131246.000|TR0|know you guy are at this meteorological 
20110119131246.000|20110119131248.000|TR0|conference, but you're also having fun a 
20110119131248.000|20110119131251.000|TR0|little bit of fun as well.
20110119131251.000|20110119131253.000|TR0|
20110119131253.000|20110119131255.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Well, 
20110119131255.000|20110119131257.000|TR0|you know, it would be a crime if you 
20110119131257.000|20110119131300.000|TR0|didn't have a little bit of fun.  So, we 
20110119131300.000|20110119131302.000|TR0|work hard in the morning and then in the 
20110119131302.000|20110119131304.000|TR0|afternoon, we go out and do some product 
20110119131304.000|20110119131306.000|TR0|sampling and investigative reporting in 
20110119131306.000|20110119131309.000|TR0|the way of, you know, checking out some of 
20110119131309.000|20110119131311.000|TR0|these snow conditions, which today are 
20110119131311.000|20110119131313.000|TR0|just going to be phenomenal.
20110119131313.000|20110119131315.000|TR0|
20110119131315.000|20110119131318.000|TR0|All right.  Let's talk weather briefly, 
20110119131318.000|20110119131320.000|TR0|what's going on around the country.  
20110119131320.000|20110119131322.000|TR0|Northeast is getting a little bit of snow 
20110119131322.000|20110119131325.000|TR0|and rain. Temperatures in the bigger 
20110119131325.000|20110119131327.000|TR0|cities right around the freezing mark -- 
20110119131327.000|20110119131329.000|TR0|so especially just north of D.C., there 
20110119131329.000|20110119131331.000|TR0|might be slick spots there with 
20110119131331.000|20110119131334.000|TR0|potentially some freezing rain.  But, 
20110119131334.000|20110119131336.000|TR0|generally speaking, I think the bigger 
20110119131336.000|20110119131338.000|TR0|cities should be OK.
20110119131338.000|20110119131340.000|TR0|
20110119131340.000|20110119131343.000|TR0|Sliding the map to the west -- Chicago is 
20110119131343.000|20110119131345.000|TR0|getting snow right now. It shouldn't 
20110119131345.000|20110119131347.000|TR0|amount to a whole lot.  The system is kind 
20110119131347.000|20110119131349.000|TR0|of stretching itself out and then further 
20110119131349.000|20110119131352.000|TR0|to the west where we are, certainly 
20110119131352.000|20110119131354.000|TR0|getting some snow at the higher elevations.
20110119131354.000|20110119131356.000|TR0|
20110119131356.000|20110119131359.000|TR0|And this has some energy.  It's got a 
20110119131359.000|20110119131401.000|TR0|punch to it.  This will be sliding across 
20110119131401.000|20110119131403.000|TR0|the midsection.  And winter storm warnings 
20110119131403.000|20110119131405.000|TR0|are now posted for parts of Kansas and 
20110119131405.000|20110119131408.000|TR0|this will probably crank up for the 
20110119131408.000|20110119131410.000|TR0|Northeast over the weekend.  The question 
20110119131410.000|20110119131412.000|TR0|is how close is that tracking to the 
20110119131412.000|20110119131414.000|TR0|coastline which would determine how much 
20110119131414.000|20110119131417.000|TR0|snow you folks get there.  Still TBA on 
20110119131417.000|20110119131419.000|TR0|that.
20110119131419.000|20110119131421.000|TR0|
20110119131421.000|20110119131423.000|TR0|All right.  As far as airport delays are 
20110119131423.000|20110119131426.000|TR0|concerned, New York metros are going to 
20110119131426.000|20110119131428.000|TR0|see some issues.  Chicago and Denver with 
20110119131428.000|20110119131430.000|TR0|a little bit of snow and then out west, we 
20110119131430.000|20110119131433.000|TR0|still have a little bit fog.     Cowboy 
20110119131433.000|20110119131435.000|TR0|Downhill was yesterday, 37th annual.  You 
20110119131435.000|20110119131437.000|TR0|have over 70 cowboy and cowgirls, most of 
20110119131437.000|20110119131439.000|TR0|which have no idea how to ski or 
20110119131439.000|20110119131442.000|TR0|snowboard.  They race down, the big yard 
20110119131442.000|20110119131444.000|TR0|sale.  But it's annual event here and it's 
20110119131444.000|20110119131446.000|TR0|been kind of a storied tradition and we 
20110119131446.000|20110119131448.000|TR0|were here for part of that in the 
20110119131448.000|20110119131451.000|TR0|afternoon.
20110119131451.000|20110119131453.000|TR0|
20110119131453.000|20110119131455.000|TR0|That was the mid-afternoon fun after our 
20110119131455.000|20110119131457.000|TR0|morning sessions talking about climate 
20110119131457.000|20110119131500.000|TR0|change and how climate change is -- may be 
20110119131500.000|20110119131502.000|TR0|affecting some of our current weather 
20110119131502.000|20110119131504.000|TR0|patterns.  So, some interesting 
20110119131504.000|20110119131507.000|TR0|revelations this week, both 
20110119131507.000|20110119131509.000|TR0|scientifically, and I didn't know that so 
20110119131509.000|20110119131511.000|TR0|many cowboys could ski down a hill so, 
20110119131511.000|20110119131513.000|TR0|well, gracefully.
20110119131513.000|20110119131516.000|TR0|
20110119131516.000|20110119131518.000|TR0|T.J., Kiran, back up to you.
20110119131518.000|20110119131520.000|TR0|
20110119131520.000|20110119131522.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Pretty cool.  Well, you guys have 
20110119131522.000|20110119131525.000|TR0|a good time out there and bring us along 
20110119131525.000|20110119131527.000|TR0|next year.
20110119131527.000|20110119131529.000|TR0|
20110119131529.000|20110119131531.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  You bet.
20110119131531.000|20110119131534.000|TR0|
20110119131534.000|20110119131536.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Thanks, Rob.
20110119131536.000|20110119131538.000|TR0|
20110119131538.000|20110119131541.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Thanks, Rob.
20110119131541.000|20110119131543.000|TR0|
20110119131543.000|20110119131545.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  I'm trying.  I'll try.
20110119131545.000|20110119131547.000|TR0|
20110119131547.000|20110119131550.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, coming up, you may have 
20110119131550.000|20110119131552.000|TR0|heard the president of China is in town, 
20110119131552.000|20110119131554.000|TR0|meeting with President Obama.  You hear so 
20110119131554.000|20110119131556.000|TR0|much about China and owning so much of our 
20110119131556.000|20110119131559.000|TR0|debt and that we are competing against 
20110119131559.000|20110119131601.000|TR0|this new super power.  Well, really?  Are 
20110119131601.000|20110119131603.000|TR0|they friend or foe?
20110119131603.000|20110119131605.000|TR0|
20110119131605.000|20110119131608.000|TR0|It's 11 minutes past hour.
20110119131608.000|20110119131610.000|TR0|
20110119131610.000|20110119131612.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110119131612.000|20110119131615.000|TR0|
20110119131615.000|20110119131617.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Good morning, Washington, D.C.  
20110119131617.000|20110119131619.000|TR0|And good morning to the president at the 
20110119131619.000|20110119131621.000|TR0|White House.
20110119131621.000|20110119131624.000|TR0|
20110119131624.000|20110119131626.000|TR0|Live pictures you're seeing there.  It's 
20110119131626.000|20110119131628.000|TR0|going to be a sunny day, getting up to 
20110119131628.000|20110119131630.000|TR0|almost 50 degrees there today.  We don't 
20110119131630.000|20110119131633.000|TR0|know if it's going to be a little chillier 
20110119131633.000|20110119131635.000|TR0|inside that White House and around 
20110119131635.000|20110119131637.000|TR0|Washington as we receive America's banker.
20110119131637.000|20110119131639.000|TR0|
20110119131639.000|20110119131642.000|TR0|Usually, bankers don't make house calls, 
20110119131642.000|20110119131644.000|TR0|do they?  Well, our banker is making one 
20110119131644.000|20110119131646.000|TR0|to the White House today.  We're talking 
20110119131646.000|20110119131649.000|TR0|about China's president, President Hu 
20110119131649.000|20110119131651.000|TR0|Jintao, is in the U.S. for a big meeting 
20110119131651.000|20110119131653.000|TR0|with the president.  Some saying this is 
20110119131653.000|20110119131655.000|TR0|going to be more style than substance, if 
20110119131655.000|20110119131658.000|TR0|you will.
20110119131658.000|20110119131700.000|TR0|
20110119131700.000|20110119131702.000|TR0|Certainly we're going to see one of these 
20110119131702.000|20110119131704.000|TR0|big state dinners. That's certainly going 
20110119131704.000|20110119131707.000|TR0|to look good back home at least for the 
20110119131707.000|20110119131709.000|TR0|Chinese president.  But what is that going 
20110119131709.000|20110119131711.000|TR0|to mean for you?  A stay dinner -- does 
20110119131711.000|20110119131713.000|TR0|that mean anything for you and your family 
20110119131713.000|20110119131716.000|TR0|down the road?
20110119131716.000|20110119131718.000|TR0|
20110119131718.000|20110119131720.000|TR0|Our next guest is going to be talking 
20110119131720.000|20110119131723.000|TR0|about it with me now.
20110119131723.000|20110119131725.000|TR0|
20110119131725.000|20110119131727.000|TR0|Gordon Chang -- he's an expert on China 
20110119131727.000|20110119131729.000|TR0|relations.  He's joining me now, also the 
20110119131729.000|20110119131732.000|TR0|author of the book coming, "The Coming 
20110119131732.000|20110119131734.000|TR0|Collapse China," also a columnist for 
20110119131734.000|20110119131736.000|TR0|Forbes.com.
20110119131736.000|20110119131738.000|TR0|
20110119131738.000|20110119131741.000|TR0|Sir, good to have you with us this morning.
20110119131741.000|20110119131743.000|TR0|
20110119131743.000|20110119131745.000|TR0|GORDON CHANG, COLUMNIST, FORBES.COM:  
20110119131745.000|20110119131747.000|TR0|Thank you very much.
20110119131747.000|20110119131750.000|TR0|
20110119131750.000|20110119131752.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Tell me this -- true or false, we 
20110119131752.000|20110119131754.000|TR0|need China more than China needs us?
20110119131754.000|20110119131757.000|TR0|
20110119131757.000|20110119131759.000|TR0|CHANG:  False.  China has an economy which 
20110119131759.000|20110119131801.000|TR0|is geared to selling things to the United 
20110119131801.000|20110119131803.000|TR0|States.  Last year, 140 percent of China's 
20110119131803.000|20110119131806.000|TR0|overall trade surplus related to sales to 
20110119131806.000|20110119131808.000|TR0|the United States.  That's up over the 
20110119131808.000|20110119131810.000|TR0|last couple of years.  You know, this is 
20110119131810.000|20110119131812.000|TR0|incredible number and it just shows the 
20110119131812.000|20110119131815.000|TR0|leverage that we have and the leverage 
20110119131815.000|20110119131817.000|TR0|that we're not using.
20110119131817.000|20110119131819.000|TR0|
20110119131819.000|20110119131822.000|TR0|HOLMES:  OK.  We always have this or it 
20110119131822.000|20110119131824.000|TR0|seems people have in their mind there is 
20110119131824.000|20110119131826.000|TR0|this us against China.  That's the enemy 
20110119131826.000|20110119131828.000|TR0|in some way, at least, a rival.  So, are 
20110119131828.000|20110119131831.000|TR0|we really more so rivals or partners?
20110119131831.000|20110119131833.000|TR0|
20110119131833.000|20110119131835.000|TR0|CHANG:  You know, of course, as people 
20110119131835.000|20110119131837.000|TR0|say, a little bit of both. You know, it's 
20110119131837.000|20110119131840.000|TR0|really a question of not the way we see it 
20110119131840.000|20110119131842.000|TR0|because we have a conception of the world 
20110119131842.000|20110119131844.000|TR0|even one big international community all 
20110119131844.000|20110119131846.000|TR0|trying to work together.  The Chinese have 
20110119131846.000|20110119131849.000|TR0|a different perception of reality.  They 
20110119131849.000|20110119131851.000|TR0|see themselves as against their neighbors 
20110119131851.000|20110119131853.000|TR0|and also they're very concerned about the 
20110119131853.000|20110119131856.000|TR0|United States and they do think in zero 
20110119131856.000|20110119131858.000|TR0|some terms.
20110119131858.000|20110119131900.000|TR0|
20110119131900.000|20110119131902.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right.  I mean, we're talking 
20110119131902.000|20110119131905.000|TR0|so much about this visit.  We're going to 
20110119131905.000|20110119131907.000|TR0|see a lot of pomp and circumstance or are 
20110119131907.000|20110119131909.000|TR0|we going to see substance?  What is an 
20110119131909.000|20110119131911.000|TR0|American family going to get out of this 
20110119131911.000|20110119131914.000|TR0|visit, this conversation with this Chinese 
20110119131914.000|20110119131916.000|TR0|president?
20110119131916.000|20110119131918.000|TR0|
20110119131918.000|20110119131920.000|TR0|CHANG:  I think there's very little 
20110119131920.000|20110119131923.000|TR0|substance on this trip.  The Chinese are 
20110119131923.000|20110119131925.000|TR0|coming here because they want to televise 
20110119131925.000|20110119131927.000|TR0|images of the 21-gun salute and the state 
20110119131927.000|20110119131930.000|TR0|dinner because they want to show America's 
20110119131930.000|20110119131932.000|TR0|respect for the communist party.  Last 
20110119131932.000|20110119131934.000|TR0|Friday, at the White House briefing, 
20110119131934.000|20110119131936.000|TR0|Thomas Donilon, the national security 
20110119131936.000|20110119131939.000|TR0|adviser said that there might not even be 
20110119131939.000|20110119131941.000|TR0|a post summit communique.
20110119131941.000|20110119131943.000|TR0|
20110119131943.000|20110119131945.000|TR0|That just shows how far apart we are from 
20110119131945.000|20110119131948.000|TR0|China.  Now, I think we actually will come 
20110119131948.000|20110119131950.000|TR0|up with a document because not to do so 
20110119131950.000|20110119131952.000|TR0|would be a debacle, but you know, it just 
20110119131952.000|20110119131954.000|TR0|-- right now, the relations are really not 
20110119131954.000|20110119131957.000|TR0|very good.
20110119131957.000|20110119131959.000|TR0|
20110119131959.000|20110119132001.000|TR0|HOLMES:  OK.  I want to back you up there 
20110119132001.000|20110119132004.000|TR0|for a second because that might have just 
20110119132004.000|20110119132006.000|TR0|gone past some of our viewers because we 
20110119132006.000|20110119132008.000|TR0|don't talk in these diplomatic terms all 
20110119132008.000|20110119132010.000|TR0|the time.  Not to have a post summit 
20110119132010.000|20110119132013.000|TR0|communique, how big of a deal is that when 
20110119132013.000|20110119132015.000|TR0|it comes to traditionally what happens 
20110119132015.000|20110119132017.000|TR0|after some of these big summits?
20110119132017.000|20110119132019.000|TR0|
20110119132019.000|20110119132022.000|TR0|CHANG:  That's huge because after the 
20110119132022.000|20110119132024.000|TR0|November 2009 summit where President Obama 
20110119132024.000|20110119132026.000|TR0|went to Beijing, we produced a 4,223-word 
20110119132026.000|20110119132028.000|TR0|joint statement that was comprehensive on 
20110119132028.000|20110119132031.000|TR0|every issue that you can think of. You 
20110119132031.000|20110119132033.000|TR0|know, this time, you know, we may not be 
20110119132033.000|20110119132035.000|TR0|able to mention more than ten words of 
20110119132035.000|20110119132038.000|TR0|agreement.  That, I think, is an enormous 
20110119132038.000|20110119132040.000|TR0|story.     HOLMES:  How desperately does 
20110119132040.000|20110119132042.000|TR0|-- and you hit on this a bit ago, but 
20110119132042.000|20110119132044.000|TR0|explain to folks.  We always say they are 
20110119132044.000|20110119132047.000|TR0|our debtor, they are banker, we hear that 
20110119132047.000|20110119132049.000|TR0|all the time.  They own so much $900 
20110119132049.000|20110119132051.000|TR0|billion in American treasuries.  But they 
20110119132051.000|20110119132053.000|TR0|need us pretty desperately.
20110119132053.000|20110119132056.000|TR0|
20110119132056.000|20110119132058.000|TR0|CHANG:  Yes.  I mean, they wouldn't have 
20110119132058.000|20110119132100.000|TR0|an economy were it not for the United 
20110119132100.000|20110119132102.000|TR0|States market.  You know, the Chinese, 
20110119132102.000|20110119132105.000|TR0|they talk about this -- or we talk about 
20110119132105.000|20110119132107.000|TR0|this debt weapon that they hold over us. 
20110119132107.000|20110119132109.000|TR0|Well, the Chinese, since August 2007, call 
20110119132109.000|20110119132112.000|TR0|it the nuclear option which is dumping 
20110119132112.000|20110119132114.000|TR0|treasuries in the market to hurt us.
20110119132114.000|20110119132116.000|TR0|
20110119132116.000|20110119132118.000|TR0|They never do it because they know it 
20110119132118.000|20110119132121.000|TR0|won't work, and it won't work because of 
20110119132121.000|20110119132123.000|TR0|the way the global markets operate.  So, 
20110119132123.000|20110119132125.000|TR0|you know, this is not really a weapon.  
20110119132125.000|20110119132127.000|TR0|We're the only people in the world who 
20110119132127.000|20110119132130.000|TR0|know that it doesn't work.
20110119132130.000|20110119132132.000|TR0|
20110119132132.000|20110119132134.000|TR0|HOLMES:  How offensive -- on this visit 
20110119132134.000|20110119132136.000|TR0|here, last question, it's always this talk 
20110119132136.000|20110119132139.000|TR0|about the currency manipulation by the 
20110119132139.000|20110119132141.000|TR0|Chinese.  How offensive is it to the 
20110119132141.000|20110119132143.000|TR0|Chinese to hear some senators now talking 
20110119132143.000|20110119132146.000|TR0|about -- calling China a currency -- 
20110119132146.000|20110119132148.000|TR0|officially calling them a currency 
20110119132148.000|20110119132150.000|TR0|manipulator?
20110119132150.000|20110119132152.000|TR0|
20110119132152.000|20110119132155.000|TR0|CHANG:  Well, this is really important for 
20110119132155.000|20110119132157.000|TR0|them.  The premier, Wency Arbaugh (ph), 
20110119132157.000|20110119132159.000|TR0|the top economic officer in China said 
20110119132159.000|20110119132201.000|TR0|that countless Chinese enterprises would 
20110119132201.000|20110119132204.000|TR0|go out of business if China allowed its 
20110119132204.000|20110119132206.000|TR0|currency to float.  That just shows how 
20110119132206.000|20110119132208.000|TR0|important an issue it is to them.
20110119132208.000|20110119132210.000|TR0|
20110119132210.000|20110119132213.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Big issues, Gordon Chang, but as 
20110119132213.000|20110119132215.000|TR0|you told me a moment ago, this is going to 
20110119132215.000|20110119132217.000|TR0|be more style than substance, but maybe, 
20110119132217.000|20110119132220.000|TR0|there will be some substance that does 
20110119132220.000|20110119132222.000|TR0|come out of it as well.  Always good to 
20110119132222.000|20110119132224.000|TR0|talk to you.  Thanks so much for coming 
20110119132224.000|20110119132226.000|TR0|in.  Enjoy the rest of your day.

20110119132242.000|20110119132244.000|TR0|David Letterman, hey, she still knows how 
20110119132244.000|20110119132247.000|TR0|to party.  Eighteen minutes past the hour. 
20110119132247.000|20110119132249.000|TR0| We'll be right back.

20110119132303.000|20110119132305.000|TR0|I guess.  And then, she's just taken off 
20110119132305.000|20110119132307.000|TR0|from there, and she certainly not slowing 
20110119132307.000|20110119132309.000|TR0|down. She celebrated her 89th birthday and 
20110119132309.000|20110119132312.000|TR0|what keeps the golden girl going? Well,

20110119132323.000|20110119132325.000|TR0|to do in your free time?
20110119132325.000|20110119132328.000|TR0|
20110119132328.000|20110119132330.000|TR0|BETTY WHITE, ACTRESS:  Oh, I like to -- I 
20110119132330.000|20110119132332.000|TR0|like to -- I like to do most anything.  
20110119132332.000|20110119132334.000|TR0|Play with animals mostly.  And vodka is 
20110119132334.000|20110119132337.000|TR0|kind of a hobby.

20110119132352.000|20110119132355.000|TR0|CHETRY:  I love Letterman.  Right out of 
20110119132355.000|20110119132357.000|TR0|the bottle.  It had to be water.  It was 
20110119132357.000|20110119132359.000|TR0|water.
20110119132359.000|20110119132402.000|TR0|
20110119132402.000|20110119132404.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Do you think?
20110119132404.000|20110119132406.000|TR0|
20110119132406.000|20110119132408.000|TR0|CHETRY:  They were teasing.
20110119132408.000|20110119132411.000|TR0|
20110119132411.000|20110119132413.000|TR0|HOLMES:  The things you can get away with 
20110119132413.000|20110119132415.000|TR0|on late night that you can't do on morning 
20110119132415.000|20110119132417.000|TR0|TV, right?
20110119132417.000|20110119132420.000|TR0|
20110119132420.000|20110119132422.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, actually -- oh!
20110119132422.000|20110119132424.000|TR0|
20110119132424.000|20110119132427.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Right.
20110119132427.000|20110119132429.000|TR0|
20110119132429.000|20110119132431.000|TR0|Well, from vodka to whiskey now.  We've 
20110119132431.000|20110119132433.000|TR0|all been --
20110119132433.000|20110119132436.000|TR0|
20110119132436.000|20110119132438.000|TR0|CHETRY:  We all --
20110119132438.000|20110119132440.000|TR0|
20110119132440.000|20110119132442.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)

20110119132445.000|20110119132447.000|TR0|HOLMES:  OK.  Let me slow down.  Let me 
20110119132447.000|20110119132449.000|TR0|slow down here.
20110119132449.000|20110119132451.000|TR0|
20110119132451.000|20110119132454.000|TR0|CHETRY:  We all drink whiskey out of the 
20110119132454.000|20110119132456.000|TR0|can every now and then.
20110119132456.000|20110119132458.000|TR0|
20110119132458.000|20110119132501.000|TR0|HOLMES:  What I meant to say here is out 
20110119132501.000|20110119132503.000|TR0|on the beach, you're at a game, you used 
20110119132503.000|20110119132505.000|TR0|to cracking open a cold can of beer.
20110119132505.000|20110119132507.000|TR0|
20110119132507.000|20110119132510.000|TR0|CHETRY:  That's right.
20110119132510.000|20110119132512.000|TR0|
20110119132512.000|20110119132514.000|TR0|HOLMES:  You're going to have the option 
20110119132514.000|20110119132516.000|TR0|to do it with whiskey now.  Does anybody 
20110119132516.000|20110119132519.000|TR0|think this is a good idea to have whiskey 
20110119132519.000|20110119132521.000|TR0|right out of the can?  Is this 12 ounces?  
20110119132521.000|20110119132523.000|TR0|I thought it was 8, but online here said 
20110119132523.000|20110119132525.000|TR0|it's 12-ounce aluminum can.
20110119132525.000|20110119132528.000|TR0|
20110119132528.000|20110119132530.000|TR0|CHETRY:  This is so popular they're 
20110119132530.000|20110119132532.000|TR0|looking to move up then to a 12-ounce.
20110119132532.000|20110119132535.000|TR0|
20110119132535.000|20110119132537.000|TR0|HOLMES:  So, you're talking about 12 shots 
20110119132537.000|20110119132539.000|TR0|in a can when you crack it open that you 
20110119132539.000|20110119132541.000|TR0|can just take anywhere with you.  This is 
20110119132541.000|20110119132544.000|TR0|the first time, apparently, that straight 
20110119132544.000|20110119132546.000|TR0|whiskey has been sold in a can. Now, 
20110119132546.000|20110119132548.000|TR0|critics what did you think they were 
20110119132548.000|20110119132550.000|TR0|saying now?
20110119132550.000|20110119132553.000|TR0|
20110119132553.000|20110119132555.000|TR0|CHETRY:  The critics, they don't like this 
20110119132555.000|20110119132557.000|TR0|for a number of reasons but, one is they 
20110119132557.000|20110119132559.000|TR0|don't want it to say scotch on it.  They 
20110119132559.000|20110119132602.000|TR0|don't want it to say Scottish because it's 
20110119132602.000|20110119132604.000|TR0|not scotch.
20110119132604.000|20110119132606.000|TR0|
20110119132606.000|20110119132609.000|TR0|HOLMES:  OK.
20110119132609.000|20110119132611.000|TR0|
20110119132611.000|20110119132613.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And so, the Scottish distilleries 
20110119132613.000|20110119132615.000|TR0|are very angry about this.
20110119132615.000|20110119132618.000|TR0|
20110119132618.000|20110119132620.000|TR0|HOLMES:  OK.  And then, some people are 
20110119132620.000|20110119132622.000|TR0|criticizing just knocks down the class of 
20110119132622.000|20110119132624.000|TR0|the drink, but nobody is criticizing the 
20110119132624.000|20110119132627.000|TR0|fact that we're putting whiskey in a can.
20110119132627.000|20110119132629.000|TR0|
20110119132629.000|20110119132631.000|TR0|CHETRY:  They also have rum, tequila, I 
20110119132631.000|20110119132633.000|TR0|mean, this -- they really -- they're 
20110119132633.000|20110119132636.000|TR0|expanding their repertoire.
20110119132636.000|20110119132638.000|TR0|
20110119132638.000|20110119132640.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Yes.
20110119132640.000|20110119132643.000|TR0|
20110119132643.000|20110119132645.000|TR0|CHETRY:  For the places, I just don't know 
20110119132645.000|20110119132647.000|TR0|how (ph) the bottles. Now, you have an 
20110119132647.000|20110119132649.000|TR0|option.  And I love how it's always after 
20110119132649.000|20110119132652.000|TR0|the ads. Please drink responsibly.  How 
20110119132652.000|20110119132654.000|TR0|are you supposed to drink a 12-ounce can 
20110119132654.000|20110119132656.000|TR0|of whiskey responsibly?
20110119132656.000|20110119132658.000|TR0|
20110119132658.000|20110119132701.000|TR0|HOLMES:  It's a way to do it.
20110119132701.000|20110119132703.000|TR0|
20110119132703.000|20110119132705.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, how many people you think 
20110119132705.000|20110119132707.000|TR0|have had too much to drink at a ball game? 
20110119132707.000|20110119132710.000|TR0| I guess, this is a -- I guess so.  A new 
20110119132710.000|20110119132712.000|TR0|study said that 8 percent of sports fans 
20110119132712.000|20110119132714.000|TR0|leave games legally drunk.  That means 
20110119132714.000|20110119132717.000|TR0|that 92 percent do not.  Isn't that great?
20110119132717.000|20110119132719.000|TR0|
20110119132719.000|20110119132721.000|TR0|HOLMES:  That's a good average.  I'm even 
20110119132721.000|20110119132723.000|TR0|surprised that it's only 8 percent.
20110119132723.000|20110119132726.000|TR0|
20110119132726.000|20110119132728.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Right.  They say that they tested 
20110119132728.000|20110119132730.000|TR0|people of breathalyzer as they left 
20110119132730.000|20110119132732.000|TR0|football and baseball games, and almost 
20110119132732.000|20110119132735.000|TR0|two-thirds had a blood alcohol level of 
20110119132735.000|20110119132737.000|TR0|zero.
20110119132737.000|20110119132739.000|TR0|
20110119132739.000|20110119132741.000|TR0|HOLMES:  It must have been a Pop Warner 
20110119132741.000|20110119132744.000|TR0|football game or something because the 
20110119132744.000|20110119132746.000|TR0|games I have seen, I can't imagine only 8 
20110119132746.000|20110119132748.000|TR0|percent.
20110119132748.000|20110119132751.000|TR0|
20110119132751.000|20110119132753.000|TR0|Does this look appetizing?  Take a look at 
20110119132753.000|20110119132755.000|TR0|this, Kiran.  Here it is.  We're going to 
20110119132755.000|20110119132757.000|TR0|give you a closer picture of it, but do 
20110119132757.000|20110119132800.000|TR0|you want to eat that?
20110119132800.000|20110119132802.000|TR0|
20110119132802.000|20110119132804.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes, of course, sure.
20110119132804.000|20110119132806.000|TR0|
20110119132806.000|20110119132809.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Of course, you would!  Who 
20110119132809.000|20110119132811.000|TR0|wouldn't want to eat a 30- 
20110119132811.000|20110119132813.000|TR0|something-year-old, maybe 40-year-old 
20110119132813.000|20110119132815.000|TR0|piece of dried pot roast?
20110119132815.000|20110119132818.000|TR0|
20110119132818.000|20110119132820.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.  Freeze dried pot roast.  
20110119132820.000|20110119132822.000|TR0|You know, it's from space.
20110119132822.000|20110119132825.000|TR0|
20110119132825.000|20110119132827.000|TR0|HOLMES:  It's special, though.  Yes, it's 
20110119132827.000|20110119132829.000|TR0|from the Apollo program.  It was left over 
20110119132829.000|20110119132831.000|TR0|from that that was back in the 1960s and 
20110119132831.000|20110119132834.000|TR0|1970s.  So, bidding on this is now at 
20110119132834.000|20110119132836.000|TR0|around $500.  Now, one little warning 
20110119132836.000|20110119132838.000|TR0|label that might be on it.  NASA is 
20110119132838.000|20110119132840.000|TR0|acknowledging that this particular food 
20110119132840.000|20110119132843.000|TR0|cause nausea and weight loss among the

20110119132845.000|20110119132847.000|TR0|
20110119132847.000|20110119132849.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.  So, they've gone back to 
20110119132849.000|20110119132852.000|TR0|the drawing board.  They have some great 
20110119132852.000|20110119132854.000|TR0|stuff now.
20110119132854.000|20110119132856.000|TR0|
20110119132856.000|20110119132859.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Yes.
20110119132859.000|20110119132901.000|TR0|
20110119132901.000|20110119132903.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And pour hot water on it, 
20110119132903.000|20110119132905.000|TR0|reconstitutes.
20110119132905.000|20110119132908.000|TR0|
20110119132908.000|20110119132910.000|TR0|HOLMES:  On the stuff, yes.
20110119132910.000|20110119132912.000|TR0|
20110119132912.000|20110119132914.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.
20110119132914.000|20110119132917.000|TR0|
20110119132917.000|20110119132919.000|TR0|All right.  Well, it's Wall Street bonus 
20110119132919.000|20110119132921.000|TR0|time and these numbers are coming in to 
20110119132921.000|20110119132923.000|TR0|CNN.  Bankers are striking pay dirt over 
20110119132923.000|20110119132926.000|TR0|Goldman Sachs, but what does this mean for 
20110119132926.000|20110119132928.000|TR0|the overall health of the economy? 
20110119132928.000|20110119132930.000|TR0|Christine Romans is breaking that down for 
20110119132930.000|20110119132933.000|TR0|us.

20110119132939.000|20110119132942.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Just in this morning, we're 
20110119132942.000|20110119132944.000|TR0|talking about the results, the quarterly 
20110119132944.000|20110119132946.000|TR0|profits for Goldman Sachs and some of the 
20110119132946.000|20110119132948.000|TR0|other big banks.  Goldman releasing its 
20110119132948.000|20110119132951.000|TR0|quarterly earnings, and Christine Romans 
20110119132951.000|20110119132953.000|TR0|is "Minding Your Business" for us.  She 
20110119132953.000|20110119132955.000|TR0|joins us now.  What's the verdict?
20110119132955.000|20110119132957.000|TR0|
20110119132957.000|20110119133000.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS 
20110119133000.000|20110119133002.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Earnings were good but 
20110119133002.000|20110119133004.000|TR0|down 5 percent from 2009.  No surprise 
20110119133004.000|20110119133007.000|TR0|there.  A lot of people have thought their 
20110119133007.000|20110119133009.000|TR0|earnings will come down a little bit.  And 
20110119133009.000|20110119133011.000|TR0|what we're looking for is compensation.  
20110119133011.000|20110119133013.000|TR0|How much Goldman is setting aside to pay 
20110119133013.000|20110119133016.000|TR0|its workers?  Both their pay and their 
20110119133016.000|20110119133018.000|TR0|bonuses all depend on how much business 
20110119133018.000|20110119133020.000|TR0|they do, how much they earn.  That bonus 
20110119133020.000|20110119133022.000|TR0|pool is $15 billion, the bonus pool, 
20110119133022.000|20110119133025.000|TR0|actually -- I'm sorry.  39 percent of the 
20110119133025.000|20110119133027.000|TR0|revenue is for pay and bonuses, and it's 
20110119133027.000|20110119133029.000|TR0|down a little bit.
20110119133029.000|20110119133032.000|TR0|
20110119133032.000|20110119133034.000|TR0|And they've been putting 320 million of 
20110119133034.000|20110119133036.000|TR0|their managing director -- $320 million of 
20110119133036.000|20110119133038.000|TR0|their money is going to charity.  So, this 
20110119133038.000|20110119133041.000|TR0|is a company who's been trying to sort of 
20110119133041.000|20110119133043.000|TR0|burnish its image, as you know. So, you're 
20110119133043.000|20110119133045.000|TR0|not going to get the big headline.  Oh, 
20110119133045.000|20110119133047.000|TR0|you know, Goldman Sachs bonuses are up 20 
20110119133047.000|20110119133050.000|TR0|percent this year, no, they're not.  The 
20110119133050.000|20110119133052.000|TR0|company has been reigning in executive 
20110119133052.000|20110119133054.000|TR0|conversation.  T.J. was asking me in the 
20110119133054.000|20110119133056.000|TR0|break.
20110119133056.000|20110119133059.000|TR0|
20110119133059.000|20110119133101.000|TR0|HOLMES:  How these things are broken down. 
20110119133101.000|20110119133103.000|TR0| It sounds horrible to hear, oh, they're 
20110119133103.000|20110119133106.000|TR0|getting all these bonuses, but this is how 
20110119133106.000|20110119133108.000|TR0|their pay is kind of set up.
20110119133108.000|20110119133110.000|TR0|
20110119133110.000|20110119133112.000|TR0|ROMANS:  This is how their pay is set up.  
20110119133112.000|20110119133115.000|TR0|You are paid, by the end of the year, you 
20110119133115.000|20110119133117.000|TR0|are compensated for how well you did that 
20110119133117.000|20110119133119.000|TR0|year. You and I were paid every two weeks 
20110119133119.000|20110119133121.000|TR0|throughout the year for the work we're 
20110119133121.000|20110119133124.000|TR0|doing right now. That's not how it works 
20110119133124.000|20110119133126.000|TR0|on Wall Street.  You share in the success 
20110119133126.000|20110119133128.000|TR0|of a company and you are supposed to, I 
20110119133128.000|20110119133130.000|TR0|guess, share in the failure of a company 
20110119133130.000|20110119133133.000|TR0|when the criticisms leaves, when these 
20110119133133.000|20110119133135.000|TR0|companies were bailed out, people were 
20110119133135.000|20110119133137.000|TR0|still sharing in even the failure of this 
20110119133137.000|20110119133140.000|TR0|company.
20110119133140.000|20110119133142.000|TR0|
20110119133142.000|20110119133144.000|TR0|So, that's simply how it works, and that's 
20110119133144.000|20110119133146.000|TR0|how it's always been on Wall Street but 
20110119133146.000|20110119133149.000|TR0|used to be almost half of the revenue of a 
20110119133149.000|20110119133151.000|TR0|bank would go to compensation.  This is 
20110119133151.000|20110119133153.000|TR0|more like 39 percent is going to 
20110119133153.000|20110119133155.000|TR0|compensation.  So, again, Goldman's 
20110119133155.000|20110119133158.000|TR0|earnings down a little bit.  It's revenue, 
20110119133158.000|20110119133200.000|TR0|39 billion, earnings of $8.3 billion, 
20110119133200.000|20110119133202.000|TR0|compensation pool about 15 billion.
20110119133202.000|20110119133204.000|TR0|
20110119133204.000|20110119133207.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Can you get us through the 
20110119133207.000|20110119133209.000|TR0|outrage story of the morning quickly?
20110119133209.000|20110119133211.000|TR0|
20110119133211.000|20110119133214.000|TR0|ROMANS:  Yes.  I really want to get to you 
20110119133214.000|20110119133216.000|TR0|in this J.P. Morgan Chase, another big 
20110119133216.000|20110119133218.000|TR0|bank, is admitting that it wrongfully 
20110119133218.000|20110119133220.000|TR0|foreclosed on 14 military families and 
20110119133220.000|20110119133223.000|TR0|overcharged thousands more on their 
20110119133223.000|20110119133225.000|TR0|mortgages.  There is a service member 
20110119133225.000|20110119133227.000|TR0|civil relief act.  This is a law that 
20110119133227.000|20110119133229.000|TR0|means you can't throw an active duty 
20110119133229.000|20110119133232.000|TR0|military member out of their home, and you 
20110119133232.000|20110119133234.000|TR0|can't charge them more than 6 percent for 
20110119133234.000|20110119133236.000|TR0|an interest rate on a loan.
20110119133236.000|20110119133238.000|TR0|
20110119133238.000|20110119133241.000|TR0|It turns out that J.P. Morgan found after 
20110119133241.000|20110119133243.000|TR0|service members complained they were 
20110119133243.000|20110119133245.000|TR0|overcharging thousands of soldiers 
20110119133245.000|20110119133248.000|TR0|thousands of dollars and, in some cases 
20110119133248.000|20110119133250.000|TR0|chasing them down on the phone to try to 
20110119133250.000|20110119133252.000|TR0|get them to pay penalties and overcharges 
20110119133252.000|20110119133254.000|TR0|that were not owed.  These people did 
20110119133254.000|20110119133257.000|TR0|nothing wrong.  In fact, it was the bank, 
20110119133257.000|20110119133259.000|TR0|a mistake at the bank.
20110119133259.000|20110119133301.000|TR0|
20110119133301.000|20110119133303.000|TR0|This is what J.P. Morgan Chase says, "We 
20110119133303.000|20110119133306.000|TR0|made mistakes here and we are fixing 
20110119133306.000|20110119133308.000|TR0|them."  They feel badly about it.  NBC 
20110119133308.000|20110119133310.000|TR0|News first broke this story.  You can 
20110119133310.000|20110119133312.000|TR0|imagine there is outrage.  A huge bank and 
20110119133312.000|20110119133315.000|TR0|people defending us and spending more time 
20110119133315.000|20110119133317.000|TR0|to answer messed up calls about their 
20110119133317.000|20110119133319.000|TR0|messed up paperwork when they are serving

20110119133324.000|20110119133326.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And was this their own discovery 
20110119133326.000|20110119133328.000|TR0|of an error?
20110119133328.000|20110119133331.000|TR0|
20110119133331.000|20110119133333.000|TR0|ROMANS:  Their own discovery of an error,

20110119133335.000|20110119133337.000|TR0|discovery, discovered by the military

20110119133342.000|20110119133344.000|TR0|CHETRY:  I'm saying J.P. Morgan didn't say 
20110119133344.000|20110119133346.000|TR0|we messed up and they are trying to make 
20110119133346.000|20110119133349.000|TR0|good?

20110119133351.000|20110119133353.000|TR0|ROMANS:  J.P. Morgan is getting sued about 
20110119133353.000|20110119133356.000|TR0|it and why we are all talking about it.

20110119133558.000|20110119133600.000|TR0|your town not going to be immune to.  A 
20110119133600.000|20110119133603.000|TR0|lot of these places are struggling to make 
20110119133603.000|20110119133605.000|TR0|ends meet and you are suffering because of 
20110119133605.000|20110119133607.000|TR0|it.  Take a look here, five cities with 
20110119133607.000|20110119133609.000|TR0|the biggest budget deficit. Number one is 
20110119133609.000|20110119133612.000|TR0|New York City, estimated deficit of $2 
20110119133612.000|20110119133614.000|TR0|billion, followed by D.C., Chicago, L.A.,

20110119133618.000|20110119133621.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Number 13 is Camden, New Jersey, 
20110119133621.000|20110119133623.000|TR0|a crime-ridden city that ranks as one of 
20110119133623.000|20110119133625.000|TR0|the most dangerous in the U.S., actually 
20110119133625.000|20110119133627.000|TR0|number two on that list, and Camden took a 
20110119133627.000|20110119133630.000|TR0|severe hit when nearly half of the police 
20110119133630.000|20110119133632.000|TR0|force had to hand in their badges because 
20110119133632.000|20110119133634.000|TR0|of a $26.5 million budget gap.  Our Mary

20110119133637.000|20110119133639.000|TR0|is, you know, is this the end of the story 
20110119133639.000|20110119133641.000|TR0|here?  Are they going to try to somehow

20110119133646.000|20110119133648.000|TR0|MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They are

20110119133650.000|20110119133652.000|TR0|officers and firefighters back, but the 
20110119133652.000|20110119133655.000|TR0|big question becomes, you know, right now, 
20110119133655.000|20110119133657.000|TR0|how do you protect this city?  Some 
20110119133657.000|20110119133659.000|TR0|immediate changes went into effect as 
20110119133659.000|20110119133701.000|TR0|these officers had to turn in their badges.
20110119133701.000|20110119133704.000|TR0|
20110119133704.000|20110119133706.000|TR0|And for right now police officers who are 
20110119133706.000|20110119133708.000|TR0|doing clerical and administrative duties 
20110119133708.000|20110119133711.000|TR0|have been reassigned to control the 
20110119133711.000|20110119133713.000|TR0|streets, and in Camden if you're in an 
20110119133713.000|20110119133715.000|TR0|accident, there is no damage or injuries, 
20110119133715.000|20110119133717.000|TR0|the police won't be responding to calls 
20110119133717.000|20110119133720.000|TR0|like that.

20110119133722.000|20110119133724.000|TR0|The police chief also says that he has 
20110119133724.000|20110119133726.000|TR0|been working with county, state, and 
20110119133726.000|20110119133729.000|TR0|federal agencies, including the FBI, 
20110119133729.000|20110119133731.000|TR0|asking them to take an increased role in 
20110119133731.000|20110119133733.000|TR0|Camden, anticipating that these layoffs 
20110119133733.000|20110119133735.000|TR0|would be happening.

20110119133738.000|20110119133740.000|TR0|The mayor of Camden, Dana Redd, says it 
20110119133740.000|20110119133742.000|TR0|didn't have to be this bad in terms of 
20110119133742.000|20110119133745.000|TR0|these deep cuts.  She is blaming police 
20110119133745.000|20110119133747.000|TR0|and fire unions, saying that there is a 
20110119133747.000|20110119133749.000|TR0|sense of denial.  Take a listen.

20110119133807.000|20110119133809.000|TR0|culture of disbelief, because Camden has 
20110119133809.000|20110119133812.000|TR0|always been bailed out by state government

20110119133841.000|20110119133843.000|TR0|of the police union in Camden, saying the 
20110119133843.000|20110119133846.000|TR0|union did make concessions.  Obviously, 
20110119133846.000|20110119133848.000|TR0|the two sides couldn't see eye-to-eye on 
20110119133848.000|20110119133850.000|TR0|this, but there is still hope that maybe 
20110119133850.000|20110119133853.000|TR0|they will reach a last-minute agreement 
20110119133853.000|20110119133855.000|TR0|and save some of these jobs.

20110119133857.000|20110119133859.000|TR0|HOLMES:  But that has to be the union

20110119133906.000|20110119133908.000|TR0|president this morning, saying they are 
20110119133908.000|20110119133911.000|TR0|actually going to court at 11:00 this 
20110119133911.000|20110119133913.000|TR0|morning seeking an injunction to block 
20110119133913.000|20110119133915.000|TR0|these layoffs.  It was supposed to be

20110119133936.000|20110119133938.000|TR0|have done this.  We should add that about

20110119134014.000|20110119134016.000|TR0|these days, you cannot afford to be 
20110119134016.000|20110119134019.000|TR0|wasting time there.  But apparently some

20110119134044.000|20110119134046.000|TR0|dig deeper on this.  And 45 percent of

20110119134048.000|20110119134050.000|TR0|by the end of sophomore year, and by

20110119134057.000|20110119134059.000|TR0|
20110119134059.000|20110119134102.000|TR0|Joining us is Richard Arum, a sociology 
20110119134102.000|20110119134104.000|TR0|and education professor at New York 
20110119134104.000|20110119134106.000|TR0|University.  Of course, at NYU the kids 
20110119134106.000|20110119134109.000|TR0|much more prepared, right, Richard?
20110119134109.000|20110119134111.000|TR0|
20110119134111.000|20110119134113.000|TR0|RICHARD ARUM, SOCIOLOGY AND EDUCATION 
20110119134113.000|20110119134115.000|TR0|PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY: Right.
20110119134115.000|20110119134118.000|TR0|
20110119134118.000|20110119134120.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110119134120.000|20110119134122.000|TR0|
20110119134122.000|20110119134124.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And he is the co-author of the 
20110119134124.000|20110119134127.000|TR0|book "Academically Adrift." So what seems 
20110119134127.000|20110119134129.000|TR0|to be the biggest problem here?
20110119134129.000|20110119134131.000|TR0|
20110119134131.000|20110119134133.000|TR0|ARUM:  We not only measured student 
20110119134133.000|20110119134136.000|TR0|learning in our study but we asked 
20110119134136.000|20110119134138.000|TR0|students what they were experiencing in 
20110119134138.000|20110119134140.000|TR0|college in terms of academic demands, and 
20110119134140.000|20110119134143.000|TR0|we found that large numbers of them are 
20110119134143.000|20110119134145.000|TR0|going through college with very little 
20110119134145.000|20110119134147.000|TR0|asked of them.  And 50 percent of kids in 
20110119134147.000|20110119134149.000|TR0|a typical semester did not take a single 
20110119134149.000|20110119134152.000|TR0|course where they had to write 20 pages 
20110119134152.000|20110119134154.000|TR0|over the course of the semester, 50 
20110119134154.000|20110119134156.000|TR0|percent.  And 32 percent of the kids said 
20110119134156.000|20110119134158.000|TR0|they did not take a single course where 
20110119134158.000|20110119134201.000|TR0|they had to read 40 pages per week on 
20110119134201.000|20110119134203.000|TR0|average.
20110119134203.000|20110119134205.000|TR0|
20110119134205.000|20110119134208.000|TR0|HOLMES:  It sounds like you're saying it's 
20110119134208.000|20110119134210.000|TR0|the school's fault, not the kids.  People 
20110119134210.000|20110119134212.000|TR0|want to think the kids are partying and 
20110119134212.000|20110119134214.000|TR0|messing around and the first couple of 
20110119134214.000|20110119134217.000|TR0|years.  It sounds like you're putting it 
20110119134217.000|20110119134219.000|TR0|squarely on the schools.
20110119134219.000|20110119134221.000|TR0|
20110119134221.000|20110119134223.000|TR0|ARUM:  I think it's a mistake to point 
20110119134223.000|20110119134226.000|TR0|blame at any single actor. We have 
20110119134226.000|20110119134228.000|TR0|organizational cultures at schools that 
20110119134228.000|20110119134230.000|TR0|prioritize everything else but student 
20110119134230.000|20110119134232.000|TR0|undergraduate learning.
20110119134232.000|20110119134235.000|TR0|
20110119134235.000|20110119134237.000|TR0|CHETRY:  The other interesting thing, 
20110119134237.000|20110119134239.000|TR0|though, is when you broke down what people 
20110119134239.000|20110119134242.000|TR0|were doing at different times.  They spent 
20110119134242.000|20110119134244.000|TR0|more than half of their time socializing, 
20110119134244.000|20110119134246.000|TR0|it says, and very small, single digits in 
20110119134246.000|20110119134248.000|TR0|terms of both classroom time and studying.
20110119134248.000|20110119134251.000|TR0|
20110119134251.000|20110119134253.000|TR0|ARUM:  Yes, 36 percent of kids spend five 
20110119134253.000|20110119134255.000|TR0|or few or hours per week studying alone.  
20110119134255.000|20110119134257.000|TR0|If you look at the time-use data back 
20110119134257.000|20110119134300.000|TR0|several decades, there's been a 50 percent 
20110119134300.000|20110119134302.000|TR0|drop in the amount of time students spend 
20110119134302.000|20110119134304.000|TR0|studying.
20110119134304.000|20110119134306.000|TR0|
20110119134306.000|20110119134309.000|TR0|HOLMES:  OK, But when you looked at this --
20110119134309.000|20110119134311.000|TR0|
20110119134311.000|20110119134313.000|TR0|ARUM:  But the grade point averages are 
20110119134313.000|20110119134316.000|TR0|doing OK.
20110119134316.000|20110119134318.000|TR0|
20110119134318.000|20110119134320.000|TR0|HOLMES:  That's all that matters, right, 
20110119134320.000|20110119134322.000|TR0|grades.  You talk about you measured 
20110119134322.000|20110119134325.000|TR0|significant improvement but you analyze 
20110119134325.000|20110119134327.000|TR0|critical thinking the first couple of 
20110119134327.000|20110119134329.000|TR0|years.  Is that the best measure whether 
20110119134329.000|20110119134331.000|TR0|or not a kid is taking something in and 
20110119134331.000|20110119134334.000|TR0|learning and being able to remember what 
20110119134334.000|20110119134336.000|TR0|they are learning?
20110119134336.000|20110119134338.000|TR0|
20110119134338.000|20110119134340.000|TR0|ARUM:  Well, all tests, all measurement is 
20110119134340.000|20110119134343.000|TR0|imperfect and has its limitations, but 
20110119134343.000|20110119134345.000|TR0|this is arguably of the state of the art 
20110119134345.000|20110119134347.000|TR0|instrument out there.  It gives students 
20110119134347.000|20110119134350.000|TR0|six or seven documents and asked them to 
20110119134350.000|20110119134352.000|TR0|reflect on it and write about them.  It 
20110119134352.000|20110119134354.000|TR0|asks them to perform tasks that all 
20110119134354.000|20110119134356.000|TR0|college-educated students should be asked 
20110119134356.000|20110119134359.000|TR0|to do.
20110119134359.000|20110119134401.000|TR0|
20110119134401.000|20110119134403.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Should be able to do.
20110119134403.000|20110119134405.000|TR0|
20110119134405.000|20110119134408.000|TR0|ARUM:  Should be able to do.  And, again, 
20110119134408.000|20110119134410.000|TR0|no progress -- 36 percent after four years 
20110119134410.000|20110119134412.000|TR0|can't do any better than on this test than 
20110119134412.000|20110119134414.000|TR0|when they started and finished high school.
20110119134414.000|20110119134417.000|TR0|
20110119134417.000|20110119134419.000|TR0|CHETRY:  The reason it got my attention, 
20110119134419.000|20110119134421.000|TR0|too is because we talk about lagging 
20110119134421.000|20110119134424.000|TR0|behind the world when it comes to 
20110119134424.000|20110119134426.000|TR0|innovation and when it comes to varying 
20110119134426.000|20110119134428.000|TR0|other measures of success, and the amount 
20110119134428.000|20110119134430.000|TR0|of money parents and kids are spending to 
20110119134430.000|20110119134433.000|TR0|go to college, and you say the grade point 
20110119134433.000|20110119134435.000|TR0|averages are just as high.  So does that 
20110119134435.000|20110119134437.000|TR0|mean we are just not getting a quality 
20110119134437.000|20110119134439.000|TR0|education?
20110119134439.000|20110119134442.000|TR0|
20110119134442.000|20110119134444.000|TR0|ARUM:  I think for a large number of 
20110119134444.000|20110119134446.000|TR0|students are not receiving a quality 
20110119134446.000|20110119134448.000|TR0|education.  And there is evidence that 
20110119134448.000|20110119134451.000|TR0|there has been a decline over time in 
20110119134451.000|20110119134453.000|TR0|terms of hours studying.  But even if it 
20110119134453.000|20110119134455.000|TR0|was always the case in college, arguably 
20110119134455.000|20110119134458.000|TR0|in the situation that we face today, the 
20110119134458.000|20110119134500.000|TR0|globally competitive economy, it's no 
20110119134500.000|20110119134502.000|TR0|longer going to be acceptable to put out 
20110119134502.000|20110119134504.000|TR0|large number of students in higher 
20110119134504.000|20110119134507.000|TR0|education that can't do anything more in 
20110119134507.000|20110119134509.000|TR0|terms of these high order skills then when 
20110119134509.000|20110119134511.000|TR0|they enter.
20110119134511.000|20110119134513.000|TR0|
20110119134513.000|20110119134516.000|TR0|HOLMES:  I certainly think the conclusion 
20110119134516.000|20110119134518.000|TR0|here is for students is that party on.  
20110119134518.000|20110119134520.000|TR0|It's the school's fault.  They are not 
20110119134520.000|20110119134522.000|TR0|asking much of you.
20110119134522.000|20110119134525.000|TR0|
20110119134525.000|20110119134527.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110119134527.000|20110119134529.000|TR0|
20110119134529.000|20110119134532.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Good luck getting a job.  Come 
20110119134532.000|20110119134534.000|TR0|on, buckle down.  Buckle down, kids.  
20110119134534.000|20110119134536.000|TR0|Thanks so much for joining us this 
20110119134536.000|20110119134538.000|TR0|morning, Richard Arum, co-author of 
20110119134538.000|20110119134541.000|TR0|"Academically Adrift."
20110119134541.000|20110119134543.000|TR0|
20110119134543.000|20110119134545.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Coming up we are talking about -- 
20110119134545.000|20110119134547.000|TR0|does that say another snowstorm?
20110119134547.000|20110119134550.000|TR0|
20110119134550.000|20110119134552.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Apparently.
20110119134552.000|20110119134554.000|TR0|
20110119134554.000|20110119134556.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right, Rob Marciano is 
20110119134556.000|20110119134559.000|TR0|joining us and he's kind of in the middle 
20110119134559.000|20110119134601.000|TR0|of a snowstorm right now.  You will 
20110119134601.000|20110119134603.000|TR0|understand now when we talk to him coming 
20110119134603.000|20110119134606.000|TR0|up next.
20110119134606.000|20110119134608.000|TR0|
20110119134608.000|20110119134610.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110119134610.000|20110119134612.000|TR0|
20110119134612.000|20110119134615.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, it's 46 minutes past the 
20110119134615.000|20110119134617.000|TR0|hour.
20110119134617.000|20110119134619.000|TR0|
20110119134619.000|20110119134621.000|TR0|This is a live picture at the White House. 
20110119134621.000|20110119134624.000|TR0| As you can see, there's a lot of pomp and 
20110119134624.000|20110119134626.000|TR0|circumstance, but some argue not a whole 
20110119134626.000|20110119134628.000|TR0|lot of substance.  This is the meeting, 
20110119134628.000|20110119134630.000|TR0|the visit, the official state visit of the 
20110119134630.000|20110119134633.000|TR0|Chinese President Hu Jintao.  He did make 
20110119134633.000|20110119134635.000|TR0|it to Washington D.C.  He had a quiet 
20110119134635.000|20110119134637.000|TR0|evening with the President last night.
20110119134637.000|20110119134640.000|TR0|
20110119134640.000|20110119134642.000|TR0|But as you see here not really a quiet 
20110119134642.000|20110119134644.000|TR0|day, they're going to out and about and 
20110119134644.000|20110119134646.000|TR0|out in front and center.  You'll see the 
20110119134646.000|20110119134649.000|TR0|President and Chinese President coming up 
20110119134649.000|20110119134651.000|TR0|in just a bit.  The ceremony gets underway 
20110119134651.000|20110119134653.000|TR0|officially at 9:00 a.m.
20110119134653.000|20110119134655.000|TR0|
20110119134655.000|20110119134658.000|TR0|But the festivities are under way, an 
20110119134658.000|20110119134700.000|TR0|official state visit.  A big state dinner 
20110119134700.000|20110119134702.000|TR0|tonight as well; but things are in place 
20110119134702.000|20110119134704.000|TR0|for this big welcoming ceremony.  But a 
20110119134704.000|20110119134707.000|TR0|big day and big talks, two big super 
20110119134707.000|20110119134709.000|TR0|powers.
20110119134709.000|20110119134711.000|TR0|
20110119134711.000|20110119134714.000|TR0|Of course, now look at that.  Kids, of 
20110119134714.000|20110119134716.000|TR0|course, invited to the event.  A very cute 
20110119134716.000|20110119134718.000|TR0|picture there but a big deal, the Chinese 
20110119134718.000|20110119134720.000|TR0|President in town.     A lot of people 
20110119134720.000|20110119134723.000|TR0|excited and a lot of pomp and circumstance 
20110119134723.000|20110119134725.000|TR0|as I said but a lot of people don't think 
20110119134725.000|20110119134727.000|TR0|a whole lot is going to get accomplished.  
20110119134727.000|20110119134729.000|TR0|This is just going to be a pretty picture 
20110119134729.000|20110119134732.000|TR0|especially for the Chinese President who 
20110119134732.000|20110119134734.000|TR0|certainly appreciates these pictures being 
20110119134734.000|20110119134736.000|TR0|played out back home in China.
20110119134736.000|20110119134738.000|TR0|
20110119134738.000|20110119134741.000|TR0|But again, a lot of people say don't 
20110119134741.000|20110119134743.000|TR0|expect a whole lot to get accomplished 
20110119134743.000|20110119134745.000|TR0|necessarily but we shall see.
20110119134745.000|20110119134748.000|TR0|
20110119134748.000|20110119134750.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Right, I mean, just the message 
20110119134750.000|20110119134752.000|TR0|that it sends.  As you said, this is the 
20110119134752.000|20110119134754.000|TR0|third state visit; only three and its 
20110119134754.000|20110119134757.000|TR0|China.  So that sends a powerful message.
20110119134757.000|20110119134759.000|TR0|
20110119134759.000|20110119134801.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Very cute.
20110119134801.000|20110119134803.000|TR0|
20110119134803.000|20110119134806.000|TR0|CHETRY:  The kids are out there.  And 
20110119134806.000|20110119134808.000|TR0|actually they got pretty lucky they got 
20110119134808.000|20110119134810.000|TR0|good weather.  If this was yesterday, I 
20110119134810.000|20110119134813.000|TR0|mean, for -- for having to hold this -- 
20110119134813.000|20110119134815.000|TR0|this is going to be up in the 40s today.
20110119134815.000|20110119134817.000|TR0|
20110119134817.000|20110119134819.000|TR0|Rob Marciano is live in Steamboat Springs, 
20110119134819.000|20110119134822.000|TR0|Colorado right now. So at least it's a 
20110119134822.000|20110119134824.000|TR0|little better but you said that we've got 
20110119134824.000|20110119134826.000|TR0|to look out again because another storm is 
20110119134826.000|20110119134828.000|TR0|on its way?
20110119134828.000|20110119134831.000|TR0|
20110119134831.000|20110119134833.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Hey, oh 
20110119134833.000|20110119134835.000|TR0|hey guys.  Sorry.  You talking to me?
20110119134835.000|20110119134837.000|TR0|
20110119134837.000|20110119134840.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Yes.  Rob, you're working, buddy.
20110119134840.000|20110119134842.000|TR0|
20110119134842.000|20110119134844.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  I'm just -- I'm just -- I'm 
20110119134844.000|20110119134847.000|TR0|just admiring my new -- my new sled here.  
20110119134847.000|20110119134849.000|TR0|I'm going to show you what this is all 
20110119134849.000|20110119134851.000|TR0|about in just a second.  It's not -- it's 
20110119134851.000|20110119134853.000|TR0|not a ski or it is a ski but it's attached 
20110119134853.000|20110119134856.000|TR0|to a bike.  Anyway, we'll show you what 
20110119134856.000|20110119134858.000|TR0|that does in the show.
20110119134858.000|20110119134900.000|TR0|
20110119134900.000|20110119134902.000|TR0|Yes, we are having a little bit of fun 
20110119134902.000|20110119134905.000|TR0|here at Steamboat but we're also getting 
20110119134905.000|20110119134907.000|TR0|some work done in the morning.  It's the 
20110119134907.000|20110119134909.000|TR0|2nd Annual Steamboat Weather Summit where 
20110119134909.000|20110119134911.000|TR0|we talk to some of the brightest minds in 
20110119134911.000|20110119134914.000|TR0|the field of meteorological and climate.  
20110119134914.000|20110119134916.000|TR0|And we get it done in the morning and 
20110119134916.000|20110119134918.000|TR0|improve our broadcasting and forecasting 
20110119134918.000|20110119134921.000|TR0|skills and then when you get snow like 
20110119134921.000|20110119134923.000|TR0|this, you've got to out and test the 
20110119134923.000|20110119134925.000|TR0|product in the afternoon.
20110119134925.000|20110119134927.000|TR0|
20110119134927.000|20110119134930.000|TR0|You might get a little bit of product 
20110119134930.000|20110119134932.000|TR0|across the northeast today. Here's the 
20110119134932.000|20110119134934.000|TR0|radar.  Some rain and snow mixing in, in 
20110119134934.000|20110119134936.000|TR0|light of the situation; you go north and 
20110119134936.000|20110119134939.000|TR0|west of I-95 it may accumulate in spots. 
20110119134939.000|20110119134941.000|TR0|And temperatures right now around the 
20110119134941.000|20110119134943.000|TR0|freezing marks so that may make for a bit 
20110119134943.000|20110119134945.000|TR0|of slick commute in areas.  But generally 
20110119134945.000|20110119134948.000|TR0|speaking in the bigger city I think it'll 
20110119134948.000|20110119134950.000|TR0|be mostly rain.
20110119134950.000|20110119134952.000|TR0|
20110119134952.000|20110119134955.000|TR0|Back to the west in Chicago, a little bit 
20110119134955.000|20110119134957.000|TR0|of snow and light accumulation expected 
20110119134957.000|20110119134959.000|TR0|there and in through the mountains in 
20110119134959.000|20110119135001.000|TR0|Denver, some snow is expected here.  We're 
20110119135001.000|20110119135004.000|TR0|seeing that right now.  And this will come 
20110119135004.000|20110119135006.000|TR0|into the northeast as we get towards the 
20110119135006.000|20110119135008.000|TR0|weekend and we'll see how close it gets to 
20110119135008.000|20110119135010.000|TR0|the coastline for potentially accumulating 
20110119135010.000|20110119135013.000|TR0|snow.
20110119135013.000|20110119135015.000|TR0|
20110119135015.000|20110119135017.000|TR0|Well, you'll see travel delays today -- by 
20110119135017.000|20110119135019.000|TR0|the way there's a lot of watches and 
20110119135019.000|20110119135022.000|TR0|warnings and advisories out with this 
20110119135022.000|20110119135024.000|TR0|system although we don't expect a huge, 
20110119135024.000|20110119135026.000|TR0|huge dump across the plains.
20110119135026.000|20110119135029.000|TR0|
20110119135029.000|20110119135031.000|TR0|There'll be some travel delays across the 
20110119135031.000|20110119135033.000|TR0|Northeast because of the usual weather 
20110119135033.000|20110119135035.000|TR0|patterns, weather situation and the usual 
20110119135035.000|20110119135038.000|TR0|suspects there.
20110119135038.000|20110119135040.000|TR0|
20110119135040.000|20110119135042.000|TR0|And then this -- the temperature should 
20110119135042.000|20110119135044.000|TR0|stay above  freezing, I think, across the 
20110119135044.000|20110119135047.000|TR0|I-95 corridor.
20110119135047.000|20110119135049.000|TR0|
20110119135049.000|20110119135051.000|TR0|All right, here you go, check out some of 
20110119135051.000|20110119135053.000|TR0|this video.  Reynolds Wolf and I went 
20110119135053.000|20110119135056.000|TR0|toe-to-toe down the mountain yesterday 
20110119135056.000|20110119135058.000|TR0|afternoon on a vehicle that I've -- I've 
20110119135058.000|20110119135100.000|TR0|seen, I -- I've mocked and I take back 
20110119135100.000|20110119135103.000|TR0|everything I ever said about snow bikes.
20110119135103.000|20110119135105.000|TR0|
20110119135105.000|20110119135107.000|TR0|It's the -- it's some of the most fun 
20110119135107.000|20110119135109.000|TR0|you'll ever have sliding down the mountain 
20110119135109.000|20110119135112.000|TR0|on a -- on a bicycle that's retrofitted 
20110119135112.000|20110119135114.000|TR0|with -- retrofitted with skis.  Reynolds 
20110119135114.000|20110119135116.000|TR0|took a pretty bad spill.  But, in the end, 
20110119135116.000|20110119135118.000|TR0|we both made it down in one piece.
20110119135118.000|20110119135121.000|TR0|
20110119135121.000|20110119135123.000|TR0|It's so much fun, guys.  I can't even -- I 
20110119135123.000|20110119135125.000|TR0|can't even begin to tell you what it's 
20110119135125.000|20110119135127.000|TR0|like going down one of these.  When you 
20110119135127.000|20110119135130.000|TR0|roll up, you know, with -- with your 
20110119135130.000|20110119135132.000|TR0|posse, you know, it feels like you're 
20110119135132.000|20110119135134.000|TR0|riding a hog down the mountain with this 
20110119135134.000|20110119135137.000|TR0|thing.  It is so much fun.
20110119135137.000|20110119135139.000|TR0|
20110119135139.000|20110119135141.000|TR0|You got to get yourself one of these, T.J. 
20110119135141.000|20110119135143.000|TR0| You know, roll down Peak Street and you 
20110119135143.000|20110119135146.000|TR0|could do it nowadays with as much snow as 
20110119135146.000|20110119135148.000|TR0|we've gotten in Atlanta.
20110119135148.000|20110119135150.000|TR0|
20110119135150.000|20110119135152.000|TR0|HOLMES:  That's a very good point you 
20110119135152.000|20110119135155.000|TR0|make.  It looks like you're having a blast 
20110119135155.000|20110119135157.000|TR0|out there.  We do want our viewers to know 
20110119135157.000|20110119135159.000|TR0|he is working there for the official -- 
20110119135159.000|20110119135201.000|TR0|what you call that thing --
20110119135201.000|20110119135204.000|TR0|
20110119135204.000|20110119135206.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  Thank you T.J.
20110119135206.000|20110119135208.000|TR0|
20110119135208.000|20110119135211.000|TR0|CHETRY:  He said a big convention.
20110119135211.000|20110119135213.000|TR0|
20110119135213.000|20110119135215.000|TR0|HOLMES:  A big convention right.
20110119135215.000|20110119135217.000|TR0|
20110119135217.000|20110119135220.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  It's a weather summit, man.  
20110119135220.000|20110119135222.000|TR0|It's a big deal.
20110119135222.000|20110119135224.000|TR0|
20110119135224.000|20110119135226.000|TR0|CHETRY:  You need a helmet by the way, ok. 
20110119135226.000|20110119135229.000|TR0| You don't want to hit that pretty head 
20110119135229.000|20110119135231.000|TR0|going down that mountain.
20110119135231.000|20110119135233.000|TR0|
20110119135233.000|20110119135235.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  You're right, thank you, Kiran. 
20110119135235.000|20110119135238.000|TR0| I'll get one on.  All right.
20110119135238.000|20110119135240.000|TR0|
20110119135240.000|20110119135242.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right, Rob.  Thank you buddy. 
20110119135242.000|20110119135245.000|TR0| We'll talk to you soon.
20110119135245.000|20110119135247.000|TR0|
20110119135247.000|20110119135249.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  You got it.
20110119135249.000|20110119135251.000|TR0|
20110119135251.000|20110119135254.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, a lot of people out there 
20110119135254.000|20110119135256.000|TR0|have opted for gastric bypass surgery but 
20110119135256.000|20110119135258.000|TR0|could you imagine doing that surgery on 
20110119135258.000|20110119135300.000|TR0|yourself?
20110119135300.000|20110119135303.000|TR0|
20110119135303.000|20110119135305.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Oh come on.
20110119135305.000|20110119135307.000|TR0|
20110119135307.000|20110119135309.000|TR0|HOLMES:  There's a kit for sale that lets 
20110119135309.000|20110119135312.000|TR0|you do that?  Its nine minutes to the top 
20110119135312.000|20110119135314.000|TR0|of the hour.
20110119135314.000|20110119135316.000|TR0|
20110119135316.000|20110119135319.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110119135319.000|20110119135321.000|TR0|
20110119135321.000|20110119135323.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Still a big medical mystery 
20110119135323.000|20110119135325.000|TR0|identifying the early signs of Alzheimer's 
20110119135325.000|20110119135328.000|TR0|and whether or not they can find out new 
20110119135328.000|20110119135330.000|TR0|ways to diagnosis it earlier and then 
20110119135330.000|20110119135332.000|TR0|treat it earlier.  Well, the FDA is 
20110119135332.000|20110119135334.000|TR0|evaluating a test that would do that.  
20110119135334.000|20110119135337.000|TR0|Right now, the only way to actually 
20110119135337.000|20110119135339.000|TR0|confirm Alzheimer's is to conduct an 
20110119135339.000|20110119135341.000|TR0|autopsy after someone has already died.
20110119135341.000|20110119135343.000|TR0|
20110119135343.000|20110119135346.000|TR0|But there's a new test the PET scan -- a 
20110119135346.000|20110119135348.000|TR0|P-E-T scan and in preliminary trials has 
20110119135348.000|20110119135350.000|TR0|been able to detect a plaque build-up in 
20110119135350.000|20110119135353.000|TR0|living brains and they're able to detect 
20110119135353.000|20110119135355.000|TR0|this 97 percent of the time.  So that's 
20110119135355.000|20110119135357.000|TR0|pretty remarkable, they say that the 
20110119135357.000|20110119135359.000|TR0|plaques are actually telltale signs for 
20110119135359.000|20110119135402.000|TR0|Alzheimer's.

20110119135404.000|20110119135406.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Another medical story here, some 
20110119135406.000|20110119135408.000|TR0|people opt for gastric bypass surgery.  
20110119135408.000|20110119135411.000|TR0|Well, you don't have to apparently 
20110119135411.000|20110119135413.000|TR0|anymore, there's a do-it-yourself kit.  
20110119135413.000|20110119135415.000|TR0|You heard me correctly there.  This was 
20110119135415.000|20110119135418.000|TR0|being sold on Amazon.com I believe --

20110119135429.000|20110119135431.000|TR0|HOLMES:  -- some people said, no, and I 
20110119135431.000|20110119135433.000|TR0|believe it was taken down but people were 
20110119135433.000|20110119135436.000|TR0|misinterpreting what this was supposed to 
20110119135436.000|20110119135438.000|TR0|be.  Doctors were shocked, this thing 
20110119135438.000|20110119135440.000|TR0|actually did contain scalpels, syringes, 
20110119135440.000|20110119135442.000|TR0|everything you would need.  It was being 
20110119135442.000|20110119135445.000|TR0|sold by a firm in New Jersey but they say 
20110119135445.000|20110119135447.000|TR0|it was meant for medical professionals 
20110119135447.000|20110119135449.000|TR0|only so they caused some confusion.
20110119135449.000|20110119135452.000|TR0|
20110119135452.000|20110119135454.000|TR0|I don't know if people actually bought 
20110119135454.000|20110119135456.000|TR0|this thing or not.  I don't know any idea 
20110119135456.000|20110119135458.000|TR0|how in the world you could possibly 
20110119135458.000|20110119135501.000|TR0|perform gastric bypass on yourself or have 
20110119135501.000|20110119135503.000|TR0|someone at home to do it for you.
20110119135503.000|20110119135505.000|TR0|
20110119135505.000|20110119135507.000|TR0|But they say this was meant for medical 
20110119135507.000|20110119135510.000|TR0|professionals and I believe it's been 
20110119135510.000|20110119135512.000|TR0|taken down but just remarkable --

20110119135528.000|20110119135530.000|TR0|HOLMES:  You would -- you would hope he 
20110119135530.000|20110119135532.000|TR0|had that stuff already.
20110119135532.000|20110119135535.000|TR0|
20110119135535.000|20110119135537.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.
20110119135537.000|20110119135539.000|TR0|
20110119135539.000|20110119135541.000|TR0|And the instruction manual is a little

20110119135546.000|20110119135548.000|TR0|Well, he was a struggling musician and

20110119135550.000|20110119135553.000|TR0|business sense and became a Food Network

20110119135717.000|20110119135719.000|TR0|It wasn't always this way.  Eight years 
20110119135719.000|20110119135721.000|TR0|ago, Duff was a struggling musician, just 
20110119135721.000|20110119135723.000|TR0|looking for a way to pay the rent.
20110119135723.000|20110119135726.000|TR0|

20110119135744.000|20110119135746.000|TR0|GOLDMAN:  Pretty much, yes.  So I called 
20110119135746.000|20110119135748.000|TR0|my dad and I said, "Dad, how do I start a 
20110119135748.000|20110119135751.000|TR0|business?  He said, "Sell a cake."  Ok.

20110119135753.000|20110119135755.000|TR0|FOREMAN (voice-over):  By creating what 
20110119135755.000|20110119135757.000|TR0|others did not, Duff caught the attention 
20110119135757.000|20110119135800.000|TR0|of cable TV scouts and turned his small 
20110119135800.000|20110119135802.000|TR0|bakery into a big brand.  Ever since,

20110119135809.000|20110119135811.000|TR0|GOLDMAN:  When I started this place, I 
20110119135811.000|20110119135813.000|TR0|sold a cake.  That first cake that I sold 
20110119135813.000|20110119135816.000|TR0|I got a deposit.  With that deposit I 
20110119135816.000|20110119135818.000|TR0|bought some cake pans.  I bought some 
20110119135818.000|20110119135820.000|TR0|flour.  I bought some eggs.  I bought some 
20110119135820.000|20110119135822.000|TR0|butter.  That's literally how simple it

20110119135829.000|20110119135831.000|TR0|afford and focusing on quality, he avoided 
20110119135831.000|20110119135834.000|TR0|the dangerous debt that doomed so many
