20110124180007.000|20110124180009.000|TR0|ALI VELSHI, CNN ANCHOR:  Carol, good to 
20110124180009.000|20110124180011.000|TR0|see you.  Thanks, very much.  And you have 
20110124180011.000|20110124180013.000|TR0|a great afternoon.  I'm going to continue 
20110124180013.000|20110124180016.000|TR0|with one of the stories that you've been 
20110124180016.000|20110124180018.000|TR0|reporting.  From all indications, the 
20110124180018.000|20110124180020.000|TR0|blast that rocked Moscow airport, today, 
20110124180020.000|20110124180023.000|TR0|was not just deliberate, but it designed 
20110124180023.000|20110124180025.000|TR0|to do maximum damage.  Smoke filled the 
20110124180025.000|20110124180027.000|TR0|international rivals section of Domo 
20110124180027.000|20110124180030.000|TR0|Dedivo Airport, southeast of the Russian 
20110124180030.000|20110124180032.000|TR0|Capitol, where, at least, 35 people were 
20110124180032.000|20110124180034.000|TR0|killed and more than 150 people hurt.
20110124180034.000|20110124180037.000|TR0|
20110124180037.000|20110124180039.000|TR0|The cause of the blast has not been 
20110124180039.000|20110124180041.000|TR0|confirmed, but the government was quick to 
20110124180041.000|20110124180044.000|TR0|call it a suicide bombing with a homemade 
20110124180044.000|20110124180046.000|TR0|device packed with shrapnel.  The airport, 
20110124180046.000|20110124180048.000|TR0|itself, remains open, but many, if not 
20110124180048.000|20110124180051.000|TR0|all, incoming flights are being diverted 
20110124180051.000|20110124180053.000|TR0|while investigators comb through debris.  
20110124180053.000|20110124180055.000|TR0|President Dmitry Medvedev has postponed 
20110124180055.000|20110124180058.000|TR0|his trip to the world economic reform 
20110124180058.000|20110124180100.000|TR0|beginning in Davos, Switzerland this week. 
20110124180100.000|20110124180102.000|TR0|He stepped up security at other 
20110124180102.000|20110124180105.000|TR0|transportation hubs.  Here's a bit of his 
20110124180105.000|20110124180107.000|TR0|nationwide address.

20110124180114.000|20110124180116.000|TR0|DMITRY MEDVEDEV, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
20110124180116.000|20110124180119.000|TR0|(translator):  We need to establish an 
20110124180119.000|20110124180121.000|TR0|investigation committee to perform, as 
20110124180121.000|20110124180123.000|TR0|soon as possible, on the investigation 
20110124180123.000|20110124180125.000|TR0|actions on site.  I have ordered the 
20110124180125.000|20110124180128.000|TR0|Moscow mayor and the governor of the 
20110124180128.000|20110124180130.000|TR0|Moscow district to come there.  They are, 
20110124180130.000|20110124180132.000|TR0|currently, heading for the airport.  And 
20110124180132.000|20110124180135.000|TR0|we need to make -- to do everything we can 
20110124180135.000|20110124180137.000|TR0|to make sure all investigation -- 
20110124180137.000|20110124180139.000|TR0|investigative actions are carried out and 
20110124180139.000|20110124180142.000|TR0|all information is obtained.

20110124180149.000|20110124180151.000|TR0|VELSHI:  And we're going to go live to 
20110124180151.000|20110124180153.000|TR0|Domo Dedivo Airport in just a moment.  
20110124180153.000|20110124180156.000|TR0|CNN's Matthew Chance is there.  But, 
20110124180156.000|20110124180158.000|TR0|first, I want to bring in Tom Fuentes, 
20110124180158.000|20110124180200.000|TR0|former assistant of the FBI, now a CNN 
20110124180200.000|20110124180203.000|TR0|contributor on security issues, joining me 
20110124180203.000|20110124180205.000|TR0|from Washington.  Tom, where are we 
20110124180205.000|20110124180207.000|TR0|looking, initially, to find out where this 
20110124180207.000|20110124180210.000|TR0|blast may have come from?  Who is 
20110124180210.000|20110124180212.000|TR0|responsible for it?
20110124180212.000|20110124180214.000|TR0|
20110124180214.000|20110124180217.000|TR0|TOM FUENTES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Ali.  
20110124180217.000|20110124180219.000|TR0|Well, I think, from Russian standpoint, 
20110124180219.000|20110124180221.000|TR0|they're going to look at this as possibly 
20110124180221.000|20110124180224.000|TR0|the usual suspects, which has, in the 
20110124180224.000|20110124180226.000|TR0|past, been Chechen terrorists.  As you 
20110124180226.000|20110124180228.000|TR0|know, they've committed numerous attacks.  
20110124180228.000|20110124180231.000|TR0|If you go back to 2002, they took over an 
20110124180231.000|20110124180233.000|TR0|opera house, and 129 people were killed in 
20110124180233.000|20110124180235.000|TR0|that attack.  In 2004, they attacked the 
20110124180235.000|20110124180237.000|TR0|Russian-Moscow metro system and killed 
20110124180237.000|20110124180240.000|TR0|dozens of people.  They blew up two 
20110124180240.000|20110124180242.000|TR0|airliners that left from that same 
20110124180242.000|20110124180244.000|TR0|airport, on August 24th of '04, killing 
20110124180244.000|20110124180247.000|TR0|hundreds.  On September 1st, in Beslan, 
20110124180247.000|20110124180249.000|TR0|Russia, they killed 300 when they took 
20110124180249.000|20110124180251.000|TR0|over that school.  They did another metro 
20110124180251.000|20110124180254.000|TR0|attack last March.
20110124180254.000|20110124180256.000|TR0|
20110124180256.000|20110124180258.000|TR0|So, I think, from the Russian standpoint, 
20110124180258.000|20110124180301.000|TR0|they'll be looking at the explosives used, 
20110124180301.000|20110124180303.000|TR0|and the packaging of the bomb in that 
20110124180303.000|20110124180305.000|TR0|airport, to see if it's similar to the 
20110124180305.000|20110124180308.000|TR0|other -- the other bombs that were used in 
20110124180308.000|20110124180310.000|TR0|prior attacks.
20110124180310.000|20110124180312.000|TR0|
20110124180312.000|20110124180315.000|TR0|VELSHI:  What does it mean, Tom -- I mean, 
20110124180315.000|20110124180317.000|TR0|you did mention that a couple of airliners 
20110124180317.000|20110124180319.000|TR0|had been blown up, leaving from the 
20110124180319.000|20110124180322.000|TR0|airport.  But, typically, the other 
20110124180322.000|20110124180324.000|TR0|attacks that we've seen in Russia have 
20110124180324.000|20110124180326.000|TR0|been on facilities less secure than an 
20110124180326.000|20110124180329.000|TR0|airport.  I mean, for most people, 
20110124180329.000|20110124180331.000|TR0|airports are some of the most secure 
20110124180331.000|20110124180333.000|TR0|installations around.  Is this an 
20110124180333.000|20110124180336.000|TR0|escalation to see an attack at a major, 
20110124180336.000|20110124180338.000|TR0|major airport, the biggest of Moscow's 
20110124180338.000|20110124180340.000|TR0|three?
20110124180340.000|20110124180343.000|TR0|
20110124180343.000|20110124180345.000|TR0|FUENTES:  I don't know.  I mean, it's a 
20110124180345.000|20110124180347.000|TR0|soft target, when you're attacking the 
20110124180347.000|20110124180350.000|TR0|baggage claim area or you're attacking the 
20110124180350.000|20110124180352.000|TR0|ticket counter areas.  Those areas are 
20110124180352.000|20110124180354.000|TR0|outside of the security.  You, typically, 
20110124180354.000|20110124180356.000|TR0|don't go through security until after 
20110124180356.000|20110124180359.000|TR0|you've received your ticket, your passport 
20110124180359.000|20110124180401.000|TR0|has been checked, and then you go through 
20110124180401.000|20110124180403.000|TR0|the magnetometers to board the aircraft.  
20110124180403.000|20110124180406.000|TR0|When you're coming off an aircraft, other 
20110124180406.000|20110124180408.000|TR0|citizens that have not been screened, are, 
20110124180408.000|20110124180410.000|TR0|normally, allowed to meet you at baggage 
20110124180410.000|20110124180413.000|TR0|claims.  So, once you go through the 
20110124180413.000|20110124180415.000|TR0|doors, and this airport is similar to 
20110124180415.000|20110124180417.000|TR0|almost every other airports around the 
20110124180417.000|20110124180420.000|TR0|world, you go through those doors and 
20110124180420.000|20110124180422.000|TR0|you're entering an unsecure area to be 
20110124180422.000|20110124180424.000|TR0|greeted by friends, family, taxi drivers, 
20110124180424.000|20110124180427.000|TR0|others, who are going to help you get out 
20110124180427.000|20110124180429.000|TR0|of the airport.
20110124180429.000|20110124180431.000|TR0|
20110124180431.000|20110124180434.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Tom, any sense that this is 
20110124180434.000|20110124180436.000|TR0|anything more that some of the internal 
20110124180436.000|20110124180438.000|TR0|struggles that Russia's been dealing with 
20110124180438.000|20110124180441.000|TR0|for so long? In other words, is this, in 
20110124180441.000|20110124180443.000|TR0|any way, connected to attacks that we've 
20110124180443.000|20110124180445.000|TR0|seen in western Europe?
20110124180445.000|20110124180448.000|TR0|
20110124180448.000|20110124180450.000|TR0|FUENTES:  No, I think, it's too soon to 
20110124180450.000|20110124180452.000|TR0|tell any of that.  And, as I mentioned, 
20110124180452.000|20110124180455.000|TR0|the Russian Federal Security Service, FSB, 
20110124180455.000|20110124180457.000|TR0|will be the lead agency in this.  They 
20110124180457.000|20110124180459.000|TR0|have a great deal of experience in dealing 
20110124180459.000|20110124180502.000|TR0|with -- especially Chechen-based 
20110124180502.000|20110124180504.000|TR0|terrorism, in Moscow and throughout 
20110124180504.000|20110124180506.000|TR0|Russia.  So, they'll be looking at, again, 
20110124180506.000|20110124180508.000|TR0|the manufacturing process that was used in 
20110124180508.000|20110124180511.000|TR0|that bomb, what chemicals were used.  
20110124180511.000|20110124180513.000|TR0|Typically, the Chechens have used a white 
20110124180513.000|20110124180515.000|TR0|powdery substance, similar to the PETN 
20110124180515.000|20110124180518.000|TR0|that was used by the underwear bomber, 
20110124180518.000|20110124180520.000|TR0|last Christmas.
20110124180520.000|20110124180522.000|TR0|
20110124180522.000|20110124180525.000|TR0|So, they'll be looking at that.  They'll 
20110124180525.000|20110124180527.000|TR0|be looking at the exact blueprint used to 
20110124180527.000|20110124180529.000|TR0|make that bomb, what components were in 
20110124180529.000|20110124180532.000|TR0|it, what DNA, or other forensic evidence, 
20110124180532.000|20110124180534.000|TR0|can be obtained from it.  Try and 
20110124180534.000|20110124180536.000|TR0|determine if it was a suicide bomber or 
20110124180536.000|20110124180539.000|TR0|whether someone left a package.  You know, 
20110124180539.000|20110124180541.000|TR0|when you go through baggage claim to go 
20110124180541.000|20110124180543.000|TR0|recover your bags, you, normally, see 
20110124180543.000|20110124180546.000|TR0|dozens of bags sitting around that have 
20110124180546.000|20110124180548.000|TR0|been taken off the carousels, that haven't 
20110124180548.000|20110124180550.000|TR0|been picked up yet, and they're lying 
20110124180550.000|20110124180553.000|TR0|around there for a long time.  So, that 
20110124180553.000|20110124180555.000|TR0|could have happened as well.  Someone 
20110124180555.000|20110124180557.000|TR0|could have placed a baggage piece amongst 
20110124180557.000|20110124180600.000|TR0|a group of other pieces, walked away from 
20110124180600.000|20110124180602.000|TR0|it, and the bomb gone off later.
20110124180602.000|20110124180604.000|TR0|
20110124180604.000|20110124180607.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Tom, thanks for shedding some 
20110124180607.000|20110124180609.000|TR0|light on this.  We'll, of course, stay in 
20110124180609.000|20110124180611.000|TR0|touch with you and all of our other 
20110124180611.000|20110124180614.000|TR0|security contributors, here, to find out a 
20110124180614.000|20110124180616.000|TR0|little bit more about what has happened.  
20110124180616.000|20110124180618.000|TR0|Tom Fuentes has joined me from Washington.
20110124180618.000|20110124180620.000|TR0|
20110124180620.000|20110124180623.000|TR0|Let's go to the scene of the attack now.  
20110124180623.000|20110124180625.000|TR0|CNN's Senior International Correspondent 
20110124180625.000|20110124180627.000|TR0|Matthew Chance has just pulled up to the 
20110124180627.000|20110124180630.000|TR0|airport.  Matthew, as you're getting 
20110124180630.000|20110124180632.000|TR0|there, what do you see?
20110124180632.000|20110124180634.000|TR0|
20110124180634.000|20110124180637.000|TR0|MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL 
20110124180637.000|20110124180639.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we see, Ali, a great 
20110124180639.000|20110124180641.000|TR0|deal of security presence here.  Police 
20110124180641.000|20110124180644.000|TR0|have been placed on high alert.  And not 
20110124180644.000|20110124180646.000|TR0|just here, at this airport, but at other 
20110124180646.000|20110124180648.000|TR0|airports, (ph) transport installations, as 
20110124180648.000|20110124180651.000|TR0|well.  But here could be another bomb 
20110124180651.000|20110124180653.000|TR0|attack of the kind we've seen this 
20110124180653.000|20110124180655.000|TR0|evening.  There's a good degree of chaos 
20110124180655.000|20110124180658.000|TR0|in and around the airport, although, I 
20110124180658.000|20110124180700.000|TR0|have to say, within the past hour, or so, 
20110124180700.000|20110124180702.000|TR0|it seems to have diminished somewhat.
20110124180702.000|20110124180705.000|TR0|
20110124180705.000|20110124180707.000|TR0|The bombing took place in the arrivals 
20110124180707.000|20110124180709.000|TR0|area of the airport, and that's been 
20110124180709.000|20110124180712.000|TR0|sealed off.  It's a crime scene.  The 
20110124180712.000|20110124180714.000|TR0|investigates committee and detectives and 
20110124180714.000|20110124180716.000|TR0|other police officers are there, trying to 
20110124180716.000|20110124180719.000|TR0|gather what evidence they can.  Also, 
20110124180719.000|20110124180721.000|TR0|there are still injured people, I see, in 
20110124180721.000|20110124180723.000|TR0|ambulances being taken to the various 
20110124180723.000|20110124180726.000|TR0|hospitals in and around Moscow, who have 
20110124180726.000|20110124180728.000|TR0|been earmarked to deal with this 
20110124180728.000|20110124180730.000|TR0|emergency.  So, we are not permitted to go 
20110124180730.000|20110124180733.000|TR0|to where the bomb was detonated but the 
20110124180733.000|20110124180735.000|TR0|departures area of the airport is very, 
20110124180735.000|20110124180737.000|TR0|very busy.
20110124180737.000|20110124180739.000|TR0|
20110124180739.000|20110124180742.000|TR0|Obviously, thousands of people still 
20110124180742.000|20110124180744.000|TR0|arriving to take their flights out of the 
20110124180744.000|20110124180746.000|TR0|country.  It's the main international 
20110124180746.000|20110124180749.000|TR0|airport in the Russian Capitol, and, so, 
20110124180749.000|20110124180751.000|TR0|it's always been very busy anyway.  The 
20110124180751.000|20110124180753.000|TR0|disruption caused by the bomb, clearly, 
20110124180753.000|20110124180756.000|TR0|has caused a lot of delays and, of course, 
20110124180756.000|20110124180758.000|TR0|a lot of bloodshed.  Let's not forget 
20110124180758.000|20110124180800.000|TR0|those casualty figures.  Terrible (ph).  I 
20110124180800.000|20110124180803.000|TR0|tell you, an airport spokesperson has 
20110124180803.000|20110124180805.000|TR0|confirmed that 35 people have been 
20110124180805.000|20110124180807.000|TR0|confirmed dead, so far, in this bomb 
20110124180807.000|20110124180810.000|TR0|attack.  More than 150 others Are -- have 
20110124180810.000|20110124180812.000|TR0|been injured.  Some of them said to be 
20110124180812.000|20110124180814.000|TR0|very critically injured, indeed.  And, so, 
20110124180814.000|20110124180817.000|TR0|the expectation -- no one is saying this 
20110124180817.000|20110124180819.000|TR0|on the record, but the expectation is that 
20110124180819.000|20110124180821.000|TR0|that death toll could well rise in the 
20110124180821.000|20110124180824.000|TR0|hours ahead -- Ali.
20110124180824.000|20110124180826.000|TR0|
20110124180826.000|20110124180828.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Matthew, give us some sense of 
20110124180828.000|20110124180831.000|TR0|it.  As Tom Fuentes has just said, Moscow 
20110124180831.000|20110124180833.000|TR0|is a city that has, over the last decade 
20110124180833.000|20110124180835.000|TR0|or so, seen a number of these terrorist 
20110124180835.000|20110124180838.000|TR0|attacks.  At this point, 35 dead, at least 
20110124180838.000|20110124180840.000|TR0|35 or so, that same number, critically 
20110124180840.000|20110124180842.000|TR0|injured of the 150 who are wounded, is 
20110124180842.000|20110124180845.000|TR0|there some -- how is this -- what was the 
20110124180845.000|20110124180847.000|TR0|sense -- as you made your way to the 
20110124180847.000|20110124180849.000|TR0|airport, of what was -- what the sense was 
20110124180849.000|20110124180851.000|TR0|in Moscow?  Is it a sense of terror around 
20110124180851.000|20110124180854.000|TR0|the place?  Is it a sense of, oh, here we 
20110124180854.000|20110124180856.000|TR0|go, again?  What is it?
20110124180856.000|20110124180858.000|TR0|
20110124180858.000|20110124180901.000|TR0|CHANCE:  You know, I think it's fair to 
20110124180901.000|20110124180903.000|TR0|say that Russians live every day with the 
20110124180903.000|20110124180905.000|TR0|prospect of being attacked by suicide 
20110124180905.000|20110124180908.000|TR0|bombers.  It happens relatively frequently 
20110124180908.000|20110124180910.000|TR0|there -- here.  The war (ph)period over 
20110124180910.000|20110124180912.000|TR0|the past several years, they became pretty 
20110124180912.000|20110124180915.000|TR0|rare, suicide bomb attacks, relatively 
20110124180915.000|20110124180917.000|TR0|speaking, but there were more suicide 
20110124180917.000|20110124180919.000|TR0|attacks against Moscow's transport system 
20110124180919.000|20110124180922.000|TR0|just ten months ago.  In March, last year, 
20110124180922.000|20110124180924.000|TR0|suicide bombers targeted the Moscow metro, 
20110124180924.000|20110124180926.000|TR0|killing dozens of people, injuring dozens 
20110124180926.000|20110124180929.000|TR0|more, as well.
20110124180929.000|20110124180931.000|TR0|
20110124180931.000|20110124180933.000|TR0|And, so, this is something that happens in 
20110124180933.000|20110124180936.000|TR0|Russia.  It's something that is affecting 
20110124180936.000|20110124180938.000|TR0|Moscow, virtually, every day.  People on 
20110124180938.000|20110124180940.000|TR0|the look-out for devices, there's heavy 
20110124180940.000|20110124180943.000|TR0|security, around key installation, like 
20110124180943.000|20110124180945.000|TR0|airports, like train stations and metro 
20110124180945.000|20110124180947.000|TR0|stations, as a matter of routine.  But 
20110124180947.000|20110124180950.000|TR0|what we've seen here, today, Ali, is clear 
20110124180950.000|20110124180952.000|TR0|demonstration, once again, that if you're 
20110124180952.000|20110124180954.000|TR0|a determined suicide bomber, or a (ph) 
20110124180954.000|20110124180957.000|TR0|bomber of another variety, it is, 
20110124180957.000|20110124180959.000|TR0|virtually, impossible to stop that person 
20110124180959.000|20110124181001.000|TR0|from detonating explosives in a crowded, 
20110124181001.000|20110124181003.000|TR0|public area.  Justice will happen today 
20110124181003.000|20110124181006.000|TR0|with such a heavy casualty toll -- Ali.
20110124181006.000|20110124181008.000|TR0|
20110124181008.000|20110124181010.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right, Matthew, thanks very 
20110124181010.000|20110124181013.000|TR0|much.  I'll let you go and proceed to 
20110124181013.000|20110124181015.000|TR0|gather some more information for us, and 
20110124181015.000|20110124181017.000|TR0|we'll check in with you a little bit later 
20110124181017.000|20110124181020.000|TR0|as you update this story.  Matthew Chance, 
20110124181020.000|20110124181022.000|TR0|our senior international correspondent on 
20110124181022.000|20110124181024.000|TR0|the scene, at the airport, in Moscow.
20110124181024.000|20110124181027.000|TR0|
20110124181027.000|20110124181029.000|TR0|Now, to some other stories that we are 
20110124181029.000|20110124181031.000|TR0|following.  Well, look, their jobs have 
20110124181031.000|20110124181034.000|TR0|always been risky but it has been a 
20110124181034.000|20110124181036.000|TR0|particularly dangerous 24 hours for police 
20110124181036.000|20110124181038.000|TR0|across the country.  At least ten law 
20110124181038.000|20110124181041.000|TR0|enforcement officers have been shot in the 
20110124181041.000|20110124181043.000|TR0|last 24 hours.  The latest incident began 
20110124181043.000|20110124181045.000|TR0|early this morning in St. Petersburg, 
20110124181045.000|20110124181048.000|TR0|Florida, where a fugitive task force, 
20110124181048.000|20110124181050.000|TR0|looking for a suspect, went to interview 
20110124181050.000|20110124181052.000|TR0|his girlfriend.  She told them she -- he 
20110124181052.000|20110124181055.000|TR0|was, actually, there in the house.  As 
20110124181055.000|20110124181057.000|TR0|they approached, police say he opened 
20110124181057.000|20110124181059.000|TR0|fire.  Two city officers and a U.S. 
20110124181059.000|20110124181102.000|TR0|Marshal were hit.  Both officers -- both 
20110124181102.000|20110124181104.000|TR0|officers have died.  We're told that the 
20110124181104.000|20110124181106.000|TR0|Marshal is in stable condition with two 
20110124181106.000|20110124181109.000|TR0|gunshot wounds.
20110124181109.000|20110124181111.000|TR0|
20110124181111.000|20110124181113.000|TR0|Police haven't, officially, named the 
20110124181113.000|20110124181116.000|TR0|suspect, but local media are reporting 
20110124181116.000|20110124181118.000|TR0|he's a registered sex offender wanted, 
20110124181118.000|20110124181120.000|TR0|this time, for aggravated battery.  It was 
20110124181120.000|20110124181122.000|TR0|thought he was still hold up inside the 
20110124181122.000|20110124181125.000|TR0|home, but we've just gotten word that 
20110124181125.000|20110124181127.000|TR0|Police made entry in the last hour or so 
20110124181127.000|20110124181129.000|TR0|and couldn't find him.  Updates on this 
20110124181129.000|20110124181132.000|TR0|story as soon as we get them.
20110124181132.000|20110124181134.000|TR0|
20110124181134.000|20110124181136.000|TR0|Detroit police have now identified the

20110124181139.000|20110124181141.000|TR0|yesterday, and started shooting.  The 
20110124181141.000|20110124181143.000|TR0|38-year-old, apparently, had a relative 
20110124181143.000|20110124181146.000|TR0|being sentenced today on murder charges. 
20110124181146.000|20110124181148.000|TR0|Still, the city's police chief doesn't 
20110124181148.000|20110124181150.000|TR0|want to speculate on a possible motive.  
20110124181150.000|20110124181153.000|TR0|Four officers were wounded but will be OK. 
20110124181153.000|20110124181155.000|TR0| The shooter was killed by police 
20110124181155.000|20110124181157.000|TR0|returning fire.  The department says it 
20110124181157.000|20110124181200.000|TR0|does plan to release surveillance video of 
20110124181200.000|20110124181202.000|TR0|the rampage.

20110124181207.000|20110124181209.000|TR0|officers killed in a raid last week.  The 
20110124181209.000|20110124181211.000|TR0|situation was similar to today's shooting 
20110124181211.000|20110124181214.000|TR0|in St. Petersburg.   Detectives, Roger 
20110124181214.000|20110124181216.000|TR0|Costeo (ph) and Amanda Hayworth, were 
20110124181216.000|20110124181218.000|TR0|working with U.S.  Marshals Fugitive Task 
20110124181218.000|20110124181221.000|TR0|Force.  As they went to arrest a murder 
20110124181221.000|20110124181223.000|TR0|suspect, a gun battle broke out and the 
20110124181223.000|20110124181225.000|TR0|suspect was killed in the shootout.  
20110124181225.000|20110124181228.000|TR0|Today's services are being held at Miami's 
20110124181228.000|20110124181230.000|TR0|American Airlines Arena.  Hundreds of 
20110124181230.000|20110124181232.000|TR0|hundreds -- hundreds of hundreds of police 
20110124181232.000|20110124181234.000|TR0|and law enforcement officers are paying 
20110124181234.000|20110124181237.000|TR0|their respects.

20110124181239.000|20110124181241.000|TR0|Well, good it's a good news development in 
20110124181241.000|20110124181244.000|TR0|a war that has had little good news.  Last 
20110124181244.000|20110124181246.000|TR0|year, the percentage of wounded American 
20110124181246.000|20110124181248.000|TR0|troops, who died, was at an all-time low.  
20110124181248.000|20110124181251.000|TR0|I'll tell you more about it, after this.

20110124181258.000|20110124181300.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Hey, breaking news for you, right 
20110124181300.000|20110124181302.000|TR0|now.  We have just got word in from an 
20110124181302.000|20110124181305.000|TR0|Illinois Appellate Court that in a two to 
20110124181305.000|20110124181307.000|TR0|one decision they have overturned a lower 
20110124181307.000|20110124181309.000|TR0|court ruling saying that Rahm Emanuel is 
20110124181309.000|20110124181312.000|TR0|not a resident of Chicago.  This is the 
20110124181312.000|20110124181314.000|TR0|Appellate Court saying that Rahm Emanuel 
20110124181314.000|20110124181316.000|TR0|is not a resident of Chicago, thereby 
20110124181316.000|20110124181319.000|TR0|making him ineligible to run in the 
20110124181319.000|20110124181321.000|TR0|Chicago mayoral race.
20110124181321.000|20110124181323.000|TR0|
20110124181323.000|20110124181326.000|TR0|You will recall that the decision was made 
20110124181326.000|20110124181328.000|TR0|after a number of hearings that Rahm 
20110124181328.000|20110124181330.000|TR0|Emanuel, who has been a long-time resident 
20110124181330.000|20110124181333.000|TR0|of Chicago, had left, because of public 
20110124181333.000|20110124181335.000|TR0|service, to go to the White House.  And 
20110124181335.000|20110124181337.000|TR0|that he did not, as a result, give up his 
20110124181337.000|20110124181340.000|TR0|status as a resident of Chicago and was, 
20110124181340.000|20110124181342.000|TR0|therefore, able to run as mayor.
20110124181342.000|20110124181344.000|TR0|
20110124181344.000|20110124181347.000|TR0|Now, the Illinois and Illinois Appellate 
20110124181347.000|20110124181349.000|TR0|Court has ruled two to one to overturn 
20110124181349.000|20110124181351.000|TR0|that ruling saying that he is now not a 
20110124181351.000|20110124181353.000|TR0|resident of Chicago and ineligible to run 
20110124181353.000|20110124181356.000|TR0|in the mayor's race.  We will find out 
20110124181356.000|20110124181358.000|TR0|more about this and get one of our friends 
20110124181358.000|20110124181400.000|TR0|who follow this, very closely, out of 
20110124181400.000|20110124181403.000|TR0|Washington, up to talk about it, very 
20110124181403.000|20110124181405.000|TR0|shortly.  Rahm Emanuel, at the moment, 
20110124181405.000|20110124181407.000|TR0|ruled ineligible to run as the mayor of 
20110124181407.000|20110124181410.000|TR0|Chicago.
20110124181410.000|20110124181412.000|TR0|
20110124181412.000|20110124181414.000|TR0|Hey, last year, more Americans -- last 
20110124181414.000|20110124181417.000|TR0|year saw more American troops, than ever, 
20110124181417.000|20110124181419.000|TR0|fighting in Afghanistan.  The number of 
20110124181419.000|20110124181421.000|TR0|Americans killed was the highest ever.  
20110124181421.000|20110124181424.000|TR0|But there's a ray of hope for the wounded. 
20110124181424.000|20110124181426.000|TR0| Four hundred ninety-eight American troops 
20110124181426.000|20110124181428.000|TR0|died in combat, in Afghanistan, last year. 
20110124181428.000|20110124181431.000|TR0| About 55 hundred were wounded.  But, of 
20110124181431.000|20110124181433.000|TR0|those, fewer than 7.9 percent died of 
20110124181433.000|20110124181435.000|TR0|their wounds.  In 2009, by contrast, more 
20110124181435.000|20110124181438.000|TR0|than 11 percent died.  In 2005, nearly 20 
20110124181438.000|20110124181440.000|TR0|percent died of their wounds.  So, the 
20110124181440.000|20110124181442.000|TR0|improved survival rate, of the wounded, is 
20110124181442.000|20110124181445.000|TR0|due to several steps being taken out on 
20110124181445.000|20110124181447.000|TR0|the battlefield.

20110124181454.000|20110124181456.000|TR0|state of the U.S. military on the eve of 
20110124181456.000|20110124181459.000|TR0|President Obama's State of the Union 
20110124181459.000|20110124181501.000|TR0|address.

20110124181508.000|20110124181510.000|TR0|CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON 
20110124181510.000|20110124181512.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT: Ali, there's no one reason 
20110124181512.000|20110124181515.000|TR0|why more troops are surviving. For 
20110124181515.000|20110124181517.000|TR0|example, a few years ago they shied away 
20110124181517.000|20110124181519.000|TR0|from using tunicates. Now every soldier 
20110124181519.000|20110124181522.000|TR0|carries one and they're applied  
20110124181522.000|20110124181524.000|TR0|immediately. They've also learned to use 
20110124181524.000|20110124181526.000|TR0|mass transfusions. So some of these 
20110124181526.000|20110124181529.000|TR0|wounded soldiers are getting 100 units of 
20110124181529.000|20110124181531.000|TR0|blood within the first day or two. And 
20110124181531.000|20110124181533.000|TR0|those medevac helicopters are now so close 
20110124181533.000|20110124181536.000|TR0|to the fighting, that troops can be on 
20110124181536.000|20110124181538.000|TR0|board getting attention within say even 20 
20110124181538.000|20110124181540.000|TR0|to 30 minutes.
20110124181540.000|20110124181543.000|TR0|
20110124181543.000|20110124181545.000|TR0|Well, we talked to some of the best 
20110124181545.000|20110124181547.000|TR0|defense experts in the country. Some were 
20110124181547.000|20110124181550.000|TR0|liberal, some very, very conservative. So 
20110124181550.000|20110124181552.000|TR0|we're not relying on one point of view. We 
20110124181552.000|20110124181554.000|TR0|combined their insight to find out that 
20110124181554.000|20110124181557.000|TR0|when it comes to caring for troops, the 
20110124181557.000|20110124181559.000|TR0|state of the union right now, they feel, 
20110124181559.000|20110124181601.000|TR0|is strong.      Some of that is because 
20110124181601.000|20110124181604.000|TR0|what I just mentioned. Also, it comes to 
20110124181604.000|20110124181606.000|TR0|caring for families. President Obama, just 
20110124181606.000|20110124181608.000|TR0|a couple of hours ago, announced this huge 
20110124181608.000|20110124181611.000|TR0|new initiative about getting more 
20110124181611.000|20110124181613.000|TR0|education for some of these troops, 
20110124181613.000|20110124181615.000|TR0|providing more programs for kids when 
20110124181615.000|20110124181617.000|TR0|their mom or dad is deployed. But across 
20110124181617.000|20110124181620.000|TR0|the board, all the experts said, look, 
20110124181620.000|20110124181622.000|TR0|post-traumatic stress disorder and 
20110124181622.000|20110124181624.000|TR0|traumatic brain injuries are a severe 
20110124181624.000|20110124181627.000|TR0|problem. One expert told me that basically 
20110124181627.000|20110124181629.000|TR0|it is almost a crime that the nation and 
20110124181629.000|20110124181631.000|TR0|the military asks so few to do so much for 
20110124181631.000|20110124181634.000|TR0|so long. It puts such stress on them. They 
20110124181634.000|20110124181636.000|TR0|feel that's going to have to be addressed 
20110124181636.000|20110124181638.000|TR0|and that's the reason why the rank wasn't 
20110124181638.000|20110124181641.000|TR0|at very strong.

20110124181739.000|20110124181741.000|TR0|Union. But what is the state of the union 
20110124181741.000|20110124181743.000|TR0|specifically of jobs. Christine Romans is 
20110124181743.000|20110124181746.000|TR0|the host of "Your Bottom Line" and my good

20110124181750.000|20110124181753.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS 
20110124181753.000|20110124181755.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Ali.
20110124181755.000|20110124181757.000|TR0|
20110124181757.000|20110124181800.000|TR0|VELSHI: A promising new survey released 
20110124181800.000|20110124181802.000|TR0|today by the National Association of 
20110124181802.000|20110124181804.000|TR0|Business Economics, which is a part of 
20110124181804.000|20110124181807.000|TR0|more work that you've been doing lately.
20110124181807.000|20110124181809.000|TR0|
20110124181809.000|20110124181811.000|TR0|ROMANS: Right.
20110124181811.000|20110124181814.000|TR0|
20110124181814.000|20110124181816.000|TR0|VELSHI: Because you've sort of been taking 
20110124181816.000|20110124181818.000|TR0|the pulse of where people think jobs are 
20110124181818.000|20110124181821.000|TR0|going. I don't think anybody out there 
20110124181821.000|20110124181823.000|TR0|needs to hear what the job situation is 
20110124181823.000|20110124181825.000|TR0|because they live it, most likely. But 
20110124181825.000|20110124181828.000|TR0|what's your sense of where it's going.
20110124181828.000|20110124181830.000|TR0|
20110124181830.000|20110124181832.000|TR0|ROMANS: Well, look, the NABE today said 42 
20110124181832.000|20110124181835.000|TR0|percent of companies they surveyed, their 
20110124181835.000|20110124181837.000|TR0|members, plan to hire in the next six 
20110124181837.000|20110124181839.000|TR0|months.
20110124181839.000|20110124181842.000|TR0|
20110124181842.000|20110124181844.000|TR0|VELSHI: Yes.
20110124181844.000|20110124181846.000|TR0|
20110124181846.000|20110124181848.000|TR0|ROMANS: Forty-two percent of that means 
20110124181848.000|20110124181851.000|TR0|most don't. but compare that with last 
20110124181851.000|20110124181853.000|TR0|year, 29 percent said they were going to 
20110124181853.000|20110124181855.000|TR0|last year.
20110124181855.000|20110124181858.000|TR0|
20110124181858.000|20110124181900.000|TR0|VELSHI: OK.
20110124181900.000|20110124181902.000|TR0|
20110124181902.000|20110124181905.000|TR0|ROMANS: So this is the best -- the 
20110124181905.000|20110124181907.000|TR0|difference between hiring and firing in 
20110124181907.000|20110124181909.000|TR0|the survey, Ali, is the best it's been in 
20110124181909.000|20110124181912.000|TR0|12 years.
20110124181912.000|20110124181914.000|TR0|
20110124181914.000|20110124181916.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right. OK.
20110124181916.000|20110124181919.000|TR0|
20110124181919.000|20110124181921.000|TR0|ROMANS: So that's a little thing. There's 
20110124181921.000|20110124181923.000|TR0|also a Fed official -- former Fed official 
20110124181923.000|20110124181926.000|TR0|today who said, look, they think -- he 
20110124181926.000|20110124181928.000|TR0|thinks we're at a turning point.
20110124181928.000|20110124181930.000|TR0|
20110124181930.000|20110124181933.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right.
20110124181933.000|20110124181935.000|TR0|
20110124181935.000|20110124181937.000|TR0|ROMANS: You're hearing from a lot of the 
20110124181937.000|20110124181940.000|TR0|economists that we've talked to, to try to 
20110124181940.000|20110124181942.000|TR0|declare the state of the union for jobs. 
20110124181942.000|20110124181944.000|TR0|All of them say, when asked, if it's weak, 
20110124181944.000|20110124181947.000|TR0|improving, strong, or very strong. They 
20110124181947.000|20110124181949.000|TR0|say the state of the union for jobs is 
20110124181949.000|20110124181951.000|TR0|improving.
20110124181951.000|20110124181954.000|TR0|
20110124181954.000|20110124181956.000|TR0|VELSHI: OK.
20110124181956.000|20110124181958.000|TR0|
20110124181958.000|20110124182000.000|TR0|ROMANS: With a lot of caveats, but 
20110124182000.000|20110124182003.000|TR0|improving.
20110124182003.000|20110124182005.000|TR0|
20110124182005.000|20110124182007.000|TR0|VELSHI: Sure.
20110124182007.000|20110124182010.000|TR0|
20110124182010.000|20110124182012.000|TR0|ROMANS: It's going to take a long time to 
20110124182012.000|20110124182014.000|TR0|dig out of all those jobs, get everybody 
20110124182014.000|20110124182017.000|TR0|employed. People with the best skills, the 
20110124182017.000|20110124182019.000|TR0|best background, the best education and 
20110124182019.000|20110124182021.000|TR0|the right mix of those things are going to 
20110124182021.000|20110124182024.000|TR0|get hired first.
20110124182024.000|20110124182026.000|TR0|
20110124182026.000|20110124182028.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right.
20110124182028.000|20110124182031.000|TR0|
20110124182031.000|20110124182033.000|TR0|ROMANS: Still have a big problem with the 
20110124182033.000|20110124182035.000|TR0|so-called 99ers. But improving is what 
20110124182035.000|20110124182038.000|TR0|they say the state of the union is.
20110124182038.000|20110124182040.000|TR0|
20110124182040.000|20110124182042.000|TR0|VELSHI: Yes. So the issue, of course, is 
20110124182042.000|20110124182045.000|TR0|that we have a lot unemployed, 
20110124182045.000|20110124182047.000|TR0|particularly long term unemployed, who 
20110124182047.000|20110124182049.000|TR0|don't have the necessary skills that we're 
20110124182049.000|20110124182052.000|TR0|going to see on the growing side.
20110124182052.000|20110124182054.000|TR0|
20110124182054.000|20110124182056.000|TR0|ROMANS: Right.
20110124182056.000|20110124182059.000|TR0|
20110124182059.000|20110124182101.000|TR0|VELSHI: So the net number of jobs that we 
20110124182101.000|20110124182103.000|TR0|create in 2011 should be higher than last 
20110124182103.000|20110124182106.000|TR0|year.
20110124182106.000|20110124182108.000|TR0|
20110124182108.000|20110124182110.000|TR0|ROMANS: Right.
20110124182110.000|20110124182113.000|TR0|
20110124182113.000|20110124182115.000|TR0|VELSHI: Might even be starting to get to 
20110124182115.000|20110124182117.000|TR0|the speed that we needed to be at, above 3 
20110124182117.000|20110124182119.000|TR0|million jobs a year. But for some people, 
20110124182119.000|20110124182122.000|TR0|it's just -- the rising tide is not going 
20110124182122.000|20110124182124.000|TR0|to lift all boats.
20110124182124.000|20110124182126.000|TR0|
20110124182126.000|20110124182129.000|TR0|ROMANS: And this is what's so perplexing 
20110124182129.000|20110124182131.000|TR0|from a policy point of view. What does the 
20110124182131.000|20110124182133.000|TR0|White House do about this? Is this 
20110124182133.000|20110124182136.000|TR0|something that becomes chronic and isn't 
20110124182136.000|20110124182138.000|TR0|news anymore?
20110124182138.000|20110124182140.000|TR0|
20110124182140.000|20110124182143.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right.
20110124182143.000|20110124182145.000|TR0|
20110124182145.000|20110124182147.000|TR0|ROMANS: And so it's not a political 
20110124182147.000|20110124182150.000|TR0|problem for the White House?
20110124182150.000|20110124182152.000|TR0|
20110124182152.000|20110124182154.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right.
20110124182154.000|20110124182157.000|TR0|
20110124182157.000|20110124182159.000|TR0|ROMANS: Or is it that all these people who 
20110124182159.000|20110124182201.000|TR0|once were in the middle class, who once 
20110124182201.000|20110124182204.000|TR0|made a decent living --
20110124182204.000|20110124182206.000|TR0|
20110124182206.000|20110124182208.000|TR0|VELSHI: Yes.
20110124182208.000|20110124182211.000|TR0|
20110124182211.000|20110124182213.000|TR0|ROMANS: Who were once part of maybe a 
20110124182213.000|20110124182215.000|TR0|two-income family and suddenly that whole 
20110124182215.000|20110124182218.000|TR0|family is angry and restless and has 
20110124182218.000|20110124182220.000|TR0|become the political problem.
20110124182220.000|20110124182222.000|TR0|
20110124182222.000|20110124182225.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right.
20110124182225.000|20110124182227.000|TR0|
20110124182227.000|20110124182229.000|TR0|ROMANS: No one knows exactly how that's 
20110124182229.000|20110124182231.000|TR0|going to turn out. But you do have a lot 
20110124182231.000|20110124182234.000|TR0|of people who are left behind. And what, 
20110124182234.000|20110124182236.000|TR0|as a country, are we going to do about 
20110124182236.000|20110124182238.000|TR0|that?
20110124182238.000|20110124182241.000|TR0|
20110124182241.000|20110124182243.000|TR0|VELSHI: Let's talk about the two big areas 
20110124182243.000|20110124182245.000|TR0|where people lost jobs, in manufacturing 
20110124182245.000|20110124182248.000|TR0|and construction. Construction may come 
20110124182248.000|20110124182250.000|TR0|back as there is another boom --
20110124182250.000|20110124182252.000|TR0|
20110124182252.000|20110124182255.000|TR0|ROMANS: Sure.
20110124182255.000|20110124182257.000|TR0|
20110124182257.000|20110124182259.000|TR0|VELSHI: And as things -- we start building 
20110124182259.000|20110124182302.000|TR0|and we get rid of all these extra houses 
20110124182302.000|20110124182304.000|TR0|we've got. That could come back. But the 
20110124182304.000|20110124182306.000|TR0|manufacturing jobs that we've lost, is 
20110124182306.000|20110124182309.000|TR0|there some likelihood that they -- that 
20110124182309.000|20110124182311.000|TR0|some percentage of those come back?
20110124182311.000|20110124182313.000|TR0|
20110124182313.000|20110124182316.000|TR0|ROMANS: Well, manufacturing has started to 
20110124182316.000|20110124182318.000|TR0|show some small gains.
20110124182318.000|20110124182320.000|TR0|
20110124182320.000|20110124182323.000|TR0|VELSHI: Yes.
20110124182323.000|20110124182325.000|TR0|
20110124182325.000|20110124182327.000|TR0|ROMANS: Ten thousand jobs here and there. 
20110124182327.000|20110124182330.000|TR0|But 10,000 --
20110124182330.000|20110124182332.000|TR0|
20110124182332.000|20110124182334.000|TR0|VELSHI: Yes. After many years of losing.
20110124182334.000|20110124182337.000|TR0|
20110124182337.000|20110124182339.000|TR0|ROMANS: After many years. And you look, 
20110124182339.000|20110124182341.000|TR0|since the 1970s, and I'm not quite sure 
20110124182341.000|20110124182344.000|TR0|about this statistic, but I think it's 
20110124182344.000|20110124182346.000|TR0|something like 7.5 million manufacturing 
20110124182346.000|20110124182348.000|TR0|jobs that have been lost since the 1970s.
20110124182348.000|20110124182350.000|TR0|
20110124182350.000|20110124182353.000|TR0|VELSHI: Yes. Yes.
20110124182353.000|20110124182355.000|TR0|
20110124182355.000|20110124182357.000|TR0|ROMANS: This isn't a great recession 
20110124182357.000|20110124182400.000|TR0|story. This is a story of complete changes 
20110124182400.000|20110124182402.000|TR0|in the American economy.
20110124182402.000|20110124182404.000|TR0|
20110124182404.000|20110124182407.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right.
20110124182407.000|20110124182409.000|TR0|
20110124182409.000|20110124182411.000|TR0|ROMANS: What happens to the people that 
20110124182411.000|20110124182414.000|TR0|used to carry those lunch buckets?
20110124182414.000|20110124182416.000|TR0|
20110124182416.000|20110124182418.000|TR0|VELSHI: Yes.
20110124182418.000|20110124182421.000|TR0|
20110124182421.000|20110124182423.000|TR0|ROMANS: What are we -- are we, as an 
20110124182423.000|20110124182425.000|TR0|education system, I mean can we put those 
20110124182425.000|20110124182428.000|TR0|people -- can they go through our 
20110124182428.000|20110124182430.000|TR0|education system and come out on the other 
20110124182430.000|20110124182432.000|TR0|end with a job waiting? So far, no.
20110124182432.000|20110124182435.000|TR0|
20110124182435.000|20110124182437.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right.
20110124182437.000|20110124182439.000|TR0|
20110124182439.000|20110124182442.000|TR0|ROMANS: So, what are we going to do about 
20110124182442.000|20110124182444.000|TR0|it?
20110124182444.000|20110124182446.000|TR0|
20110124182446.000|20110124182449.000|TR0|VELSHI: Right.
20110124182449.000|20110124182451.000|TR0|
20110124182451.000|20110124182453.000|TR0|ROMANS: This is a -- this is still a 
20110124182453.000|20110124182456.000|TR0|tricky subject. So improving is a state of 
20110124182456.000|20110124182458.000|TR0|the union on jobs with asterisks and every 
20110124182458.000|20110124182500.000|TR0|one of the economists that we surveyed, 
20110124182500.000|20110124182502.000|TR0|you know, top people in their field, all 
20110124182502.000|20110124182505.000|TR0|had an asterisk on the improving number.
20110124182505.000|20110124182507.000|TR0|
20110124182507.000|20110124182509.000|TR0|VELSHI: OK. All right. Well, that's -- so 
20110124182509.000|20110124182512.000|TR0|the asterisk is the key part here?
20110124182512.000|20110124182514.000|TR0|
20110124182514.000|20110124182516.000|TR0|ROMANS: Yes.
20110124182516.000|20110124182519.000|TR0|
20110124182519.000|20110124182521.000|TR0|VELSHI: Improving, but for some people, 
20110124182521.000|20110124182523.000|TR0|they are going to have to take a hard look 
20110124182523.000|20110124182526.000|TR0|at restraining into something where there 
20110124182526.000|20110124182528.000|TR0|is going to be demand for them.
20110124182528.000|20110124182530.000|TR0|
20110124182530.000|20110124182533.000|TR0|ROMANS: That's right.
20110124182533.000|20110124182535.000|TR0|
20110124182535.000|20110124182537.000|TR0|VELSHI: It's just -- it's not going to be 
20110124182537.000|20110124182540.000|TR0|demand all across the board. OK, you'll be 
20110124182540.000|20110124182542.000|TR0|doing this -- I know this is something 
20110124182542.000|20110124182544.000|TR0|that you follow very closely, but thanks 
20110124182544.000|20110124182547.000|TR0|very much for talking to us.
20110124182547.000|20110124182549.000|TR0|
20110124182549.000|20110124182551.000|TR0|ROMANS: Next hour I'll have housing for 
20110124182551.000|20110124182554.000|TR0|you as well. And that's --
20110124182554.000|20110124182556.000|TR0|
20110124182556.000|20110124182558.000|TR0|VELSHI: That's another -- that's another 
20110124182558.000|20110124182601.000|TR0|big leg --
20110124182601.000|20110124182603.000|TR0|
20110124182603.000|20110124182605.000|TR0|ROMANS: Housing and small business next 
20110124182605.000|20110124182608.000|TR0|hour.
20110124182608.000|20110124182610.000|TR0|
20110124182610.000|20110124182612.000|TR0|VELSHI: OK. We'll talk to you about that. 
20110124182612.000|20110124182614.000|TR0|Christine Romans.
20110124182614.000|20110124182617.000|TR0|
20110124182617.000|20110124182619.000|TR0|ROMANS: Sure.
20110124182619.000|20110124182621.000|TR0|
20110124182621.000|20110124182624.000|TR0|VELSHI: Be sure to tune in to "Your Bottom 
20110124182624.000|20110124182626.000|TR0|Line," by the way, each Saturday morning 
20110124182626.000|20110124182628.000|TR0|at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. "Your Money"

20110124182631.000|20110124182633.000|TR0|Sundays at 3:00 p.m. Eastern. So, on the 
20110124182633.000|20110124182635.000|TR0|weekend, three opportunities to get 
20110124182635.000|20110124182638.000|TR0|smarter about how to make more money and 
20110124182638.000|20110124182640.000|TR0|how to be more prosperous.
20110124182640.000|20110124182642.000|TR0|
20110124182642.000|20110124182645.000|TR0|OK, you can't buy a lot with eight cents, 
20110124182645.000|20110124182647.000|TR0|can you. But after the break, I'm going to 
20110124182647.000|20110124182649.000|TR0|show you how the whole federal government 
20110124182649.000|20110124182652.000|TR0|may have to get by on eight cents out of 
20110124182652.000|20110124182654.000|TR0|every taxpayer dollar. You really can't 
20110124182654.000|20110124182656.000|TR0|afford to miss it.
20110124182656.000|20110124182659.000|TR0|
20110124182659.000|20110124182701.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110124182701.000|20110124182703.000|TR0|
20110124182703.000|20110124182706.000|TR0|VELSHI: We just received a ruling from an 
20110124182706.000|20110124182708.000|TR0|appellate court in Illinois that seems to 
20110124182708.000|20110124182710.000|TR0|be kicking Rahm Emanuel out of the mayoral 
20110124182710.000|20110124182713.000|TR0|race in Chicago. Let's go right to our 
20110124182713.000|20110124182715.000|TR0|political desk. Shannon Travis joins us 
20110124182715.000|20110124182717.000|TR0|now with an update on that.
20110124182717.000|20110124182720.000|TR0|
20110124182720.000|20110124182722.000|TR0|Shannon, what do we know?
20110124182722.000|20110124182724.000|TR0|
20110124182724.000|20110124182727.000|TR0|SHANNON TRAVIS, CNN POLITICAL PRODUCER: 
20110124182727.000|20110124182729.000|TR0|That's right, Ali. This is a stunning 
20110124182729.000|20110124182731.000|TR0|development out of Chicago. As you just 
20110124182731.000|20110124182733.000|TR0|said, Rahm Emanuel being kicked off of the 
20110124182733.000|20110124182736.000|TR0|ballot for his Chicago mayor's race. We're 
20110124182736.000|20110124182738.000|TR0|still going through the ruling right here. 
20110124182738.000|20110124182740.000|TR0|It's pretty long. We're trying to figure 
20110124182740.000|20110124182743.000|TR0|out why the court is -- this appellate 
20110124182743.000|20110124182745.000|TR0|court is ruling against Rahm Emanuel, 
20110124182745.000|20110124182747.000|TR0|saying that basically he wasn't a resident 
20110124182747.000|20110124182750.000|TR0|of Chicago. Our viewers remember that. He 
20110124182750.000|20110124182752.000|TR0|was White House chief of staff. He came to 
20110124182752.000|20110124182754.000|TR0|Washington for a while.
20110124182754.000|20110124182757.000|TR0|
20110124182757.000|20110124182759.000|TR0|Back in December, the Chicago Board of 
20110124182759.000|20110124182801.000|TR0|Elections said, hey, he was actually 
20110124182801.000|20110124182804.000|TR0|eligible to be on the ballot because he 
20110124182804.000|20110124182806.000|TR0|was a resident in Chicago, even while he 
20110124182806.000|20110124182808.000|TR0|was here in D.C. But this court says, hey, 
20110124182808.000|20110124182811.000|TR0|no, by a two to one decision, they are 
20110124182811.000|20110124182813.000|TR0|saying that his name should be booted off 
20110124182813.000|20110124182815.000|TR0|the ballot.
20110124182815.000|20110124182818.000|TR0|
20110124182818.000|20110124182820.000|TR0|We are expecting Rahm Emanuel's campaign 
20110124182820.000|20110124182822.000|TR0|to appeal this decision to the Illinois 
20110124182822.000|20110124182825.000|TR0|state supreme court. So it's not over yet. 
20110124182825.000|20110124182827.000|TR0|But right now this is a stunning 
20110124182827.000|20110124182829.000|TR0|development to his chances. If you'll 
20110124182829.000|20110124182832.000|TR0|remember, in a recent poll by "The Chicago 
20110124182832.000|20110124182834.000|TR0|Tribune," WGN (ph), he was up 44 percent. 
20110124182834.000|20110124182836.000|TR0|If he had cleared 50 percent in this 
20110124182836.000|20110124182839.000|TR0|February 22nd run-off -- primary, he could 
20110124182839.000|20110124182841.000|TR0|avoided an actual run-off. So things were 
20110124182841.000|20110124182843.000|TR0|looking pretty good. So this is a huge 
20110124182843.000|20110124182845.000|TR0|setback for him, Ali.
20110124182845.000|20110124182848.000|TR0|
20110124182848.000|20110124182850.000|TR0|VELSHI: How much time does he have to 
20110124182850.000|20110124182852.000|TR0|start with these appeals and the concern 
20110124182852.000|20110124182855.000|TR0|that another court might overrule it. I 
20110124182855.000|20110124182857.000|TR0|mean at some point there's an election and 
20110124182857.000|20110124182859.000|TR0|he's got to be in it. Does he still got 
20110124182859.000|20110124182902.000|TR0|enough time to make this work?
20110124182902.000|20110124182904.000|TR0|
20110124182904.000|20110124182906.000|TR0|TRAVIS: Well, we're trying to -- we've 
20110124182906.000|20110124182909.000|TR0|placed some calls to Rahm Emanuel's 
20110124182909.000|20110124182911.000|TR0|campaign now. We're trying to ascertain 
20110124182911.000|20110124182913.000|TR0|the time line that they'll move and to try 
20110124182913.000|20110124182916.000|TR0|and have this thing appealed. Of course, 
20110124182916.000|20110124182918.000|TR0|they will want to wrap this up as soon as 
20110124182918.000|20110124182920.000|TR0|possible. Again, that primary is February 
20110124182920.000|20110124182923.000|TR0|22nd. So they don't have a whole lot of 
20110124182923.000|20110124182925.000|TR0|time to play with. But we've got some 
20110124182925.000|20110124182927.000|TR0|calls out to see when they'll actually be 
20110124182927.000|20110124182930.000|TR0|appealing this to the state supreme court 
20110124182930.000|20110124182932.000|TR0|there in Illinois. But it's our guess that 
20110124182932.000|20110124182934.000|TR0|they'll want to move fast on this, Ali.
20110124182934.000|20110124182937.000|TR0|
20110124182937.000|20110124182939.000|TR0|VELSHI: Shannon, the issue initially was 
20110124182939.000|20110124182941.000|TR0|that he moved away to work at the White 
20110124182941.000|20110124182944.000|TR0|House and the initial ruling was that he 
20110124182944.000|20110124182946.000|TR0|had worked away -- he moved away because 
20110124182946.000|20110124182948.000|TR0|it was -- he was performing a public 
20110124182948.000|20110124182951.000|TR0|service and that doesn't count as him sort 
20110124182951.000|20110124182953.000|TR0|of abandoning his residence in Chicago. 
20110124182953.000|20110124182955.000|TR0|That was the initial thinking.
20110124182955.000|20110124182957.000|TR0|
20110124182957.000|20110124183000.000|TR0|TRAVIS: That's right. That's right. And 
20110124183000.000|20110124183002.000|TR0|the board of elections again -- the 
20110124183002.000|20110124183004.000|TR0|Chicago Board of Elections in December 
20110124183004.000|20110124183007.000|TR0|said, hey, that because of those reasons 
20110124183007.000|20110124183009.000|TR0|that you just outlined, that he was 
20110124183009.000|20110124183011.000|TR0|actually still a resident of Chicago. You 
20110124183011.000|20110124183014.000|TR0|remember that he was also a congressman 
20110124183014.000|20110124183016.000|TR0|from the Chicago area for a long time 
20110124183016.000|20110124183018.000|TR0|before becoming chief of staff to 
20110124183018.000|20110124183021.000|TR0|President Barack Obama. So those issues, 
20110124183021.000|20110124183023.000|TR0|at least we thought were cleared up by 
20110124183023.000|20110124183025.000|TR0|this ruling back in December. But this 
20110124183025.000|20110124183028.000|TR0|appellate court is saying, hey, no, that's 
20110124183028.000|20110124183030.000|TR0|not the case. That he was not, in fact, a 
20110124183030.000|20110124183032.000|TR0|resident and his name should be tossed off 
20110124183032.000|20110124183035.000|TR0|the ballot.
20110124183035.000|20110124183037.000|TR0|
20110124183037.000|20110124183039.000|TR0|VELSHI: All right. Shannon, we'll stay on 
20110124183039.000|20110124183042.000|TR0|top of this with you. Thank you so much 
20110124183042.000|20110124183044.000|TR0|for joining us. Shannon Travis. We'll find 
20110124183044.000|20110124183046.000|TR0|out more about that story and find out 
20110124183046.000|20110124183049.000|TR0|what those timelines are and get back to 
20110124183049.000|20110124183051.000|TR0|you with more on that.
20110124183051.000|20110124183053.000|TR0|
20110124183053.000|20110124183056.000|TR0|All right, we all know we've got to pay 
20110124183056.000|20110124183058.000|TR0|our bills before we buy our snow tires or 
20110124183058.000|20110124183100.000|TR0|football tickets or paint the house. Well, 
20110124183100.000|20110124183103.000|TR0|the government's the same way, sort of. 
20110124183103.000|20110124183105.000|TR0|The government has to fund so- called 
20110124183105.000|20110124183107.000|TR0|entitlements. Those are Social Security, 
20110124183107.000|20110124183110.000|TR0|Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on 
20110124183110.000|20110124183112.000|TR0|our gargantuan debt. In theory, just like 
20110124183112.000|20110124183114.000|TR0|you, those are the things that have to be 
20110124183114.000|20110124183116.000|TR0|paid. There's no flexibility on that.
20110124183116.000|20110124183119.000|TR0|
20110124183119.000|20110124183121.000|TR0|Well, what's left?  At the moment, after 
20110124183121.000|20110124183123.000|TR0|you pay those things, 24 cents out of 
20110124183123.000|20110124183126.000|TR0|every dollar the Treasury takes in is 
20110124183126.000|20110124183128.000|TR0|left.  You don't think that is too much.  
20110124183128.000|20110124183130.000|TR0|If you think that's scary, just wait a few 
20110124183130.000|20110124183133.000|TR0|years.  My colleague Jeanne Sahadi from 
20110124183133.000|20110124183135.000|TR0|CNN Money joins me with a pretty dire 
20110124183135.000|20110124183137.000|TR0|prediction from the GAO.
20110124183137.000|20110124183140.000|TR0|
20110124183140.000|20110124183142.000|TR0|Who is the GAO and why is this so dire?
20110124183142.000|20110124183144.000|TR0|
20110124183144.000|20110124183147.000|TR0|JEANNE SAHADI, SENIOR WRITER, 
20110124183147.000|20110124183149.000|TR0|CNNMONEY.COM:  They're an independent 
20110124183149.000|20110124183151.000|TR0|agency that's basically like the 
20110124183151.000|20110124183154.000|TR0|government's auditor.
20110124183154.000|20110124183156.000|TR0|
20110124183156.000|20110124183158.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110124183158.000|20110124183201.000|TR0|
20110124183201.000|20110124183203.000|TR0|SAHADI:  They're nonpartisan, they tell it 
20110124183203.000|20110124183205.000|TR0|like it is.  Right. So, they made a 
20110124183205.000|20110124183208.000|TR0|simulation looking at the long-term fiscal 
20110124183208.000|20110124183210.000|TR0|outlook. They do this every year.  And 
20110124183210.000|20110124183212.000|TR0|they said that -- certain assumptions they 
20110124183212.000|20110124183215.000|TR0|assume the tax cuts stay in place, they 
20110124183215.000|20110124183217.000|TR0|assume AMT, everyone's protected from that 
20110124183217.000|20110124183219.000|TR0|wealth tax and so on.
20110124183219.000|20110124183222.000|TR0|
20110124183222.000|20110124183224.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110124183224.000|20110124183226.000|TR0|
20110124183226.000|20110124183228.000|TR0|SAHADI:  And they say by 2020, we're going 
20110124183228.000|20110124183231.000|TR0|to have about eight cents of every federal 
20110124183231.000|20110124183233.000|TR0|tax dollar available to pay for everything 
20110124183233.000|20110124183235.000|TR0|except Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security 
20110124183235.000|20110124183238.000|TR0|and interest.
20110124183238.000|20110124183240.000|TR0|
20110124183240.000|20110124183242.000|TR0|VELSHI:  So one-third of what the 
20110124183242.000|20110124183245.000|TR0|government has now will be left in 2020?
20110124183245.000|20110124183247.000|TR0|
20110124183247.000|20110124183249.000|TR0|SAHADI:  Right.
20110124183249.000|20110124183252.000|TR0|
20110124183252.000|20110124183254.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Let's show our viewers how this 
20110124183254.000|20110124183256.000|TR0|all breaks down.  I think we've got an 
20110124183256.000|20110124183259.000|TR0|animation we can show them.
20110124183259.000|20110124183301.000|TR0|
20110124183301.000|20110124183303.000|TR0|You take the whole pie, the whole 100 
20110124183303.000|20110124183306.000|TR0|cents and you start taking out big things 
20110124183306.000|20110124183308.000|TR0|and you're left with eight cents.  So the 
20110124183308.000|20110124183310.000|TR0|first thing is Medicare.
20110124183310.000|20110124183313.000|TR0|
20110124183313.000|20110124183315.000|TR0|SAHADI:  Right.  That's about 21 percent.  
20110124183315.000|20110124183317.000|TR0|Medicaid is about 15 percent.  So total, 
20110124183317.000|20110124183320.000|TR0|36 percent.  Then you've got Social 
20110124183320.000|20110124183322.000|TR0|Security, which is 28 percent.  And 
20110124183322.000|20110124183324.000|TR0|another 28 percent for interest, which 
20110124183324.000|20110124183327.000|TR0|should be cut.   And then you've got eight 
20110124183327.000|20110124183329.000|TR0|percent left for everything else which 
20110124183329.000|20110124183331.000|TR0|encompasses everything that most people 
20110124183331.000|20110124183334.000|TR0|think of as federal government.
20110124183334.000|20110124183336.000|TR0|
20110124183336.000|20110124183338.000|TR0|VELSHI:  So here's -- this may be the best 
20110124183338.000|20110124183341.000|TR0|explanation yet of what this debt crisis 
20110124183341.000|20110124183343.000|TR0|is about.  Ultimately, that's what it 
20110124183343.000|20110124183345.000|TR0|comes down to, that in 10 years -- less 
20110124183345.000|20110124183347.000|TR0|than 10 years, nine years, we could be, if 
20110124183347.000|20110124183350.000|TR0|you believe these projections, left with 
20110124183350.000|20110124183352.000|TR0|eight cents out of every dollar for 
20110124183352.000|20110124183354.000|TR0|everything that is not those things you 
20110124183354.000|20110124183357.000|TR0|mentioned.
20110124183357.000|20110124183359.000|TR0|
20110124183359.000|20110124183401.000|TR0|Such as what?  What are the things that 
20110124183401.000|20110124183404.000|TR0|would have to suffer?
20110124183404.000|20110124183406.000|TR0|
20110124183406.000|20110124183408.000|TR0|SAHADI:  The Department of Labor, National 
20110124183408.000|20110124183411.000|TR0|Parks, air traffic control, food and 
20110124183411.000|20110124183413.000|TR0|safety, food and drug safety.
20110124183413.000|20110124183415.000|TR0|
20110124183415.000|20110124183418.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  So you complain you don't 
20110124183418.000|20110124183420.000|TR0|want things recalled and you don't want --
20110124183420.000|20110124183422.000|TR0|
20110124183422.000|20110124183425.000|TR0|SAHADI:  Student loans.
20110124183425.000|20110124183427.000|TR0|
20110124183427.000|20110124183429.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110124183429.000|20110124183432.000|TR0|
20110124183432.000|20110124183434.000|TR0|SAHADI:  Federal student loans.  Pretty 
20110124183434.000|20110124183436.000|TR0|much everything that the government does 
20110124183436.000|20110124183439.000|TR0|except those three programs and the 
20110124183439.000|20110124183441.000|TR0|interest on the debt, which nobody really 
20110124183441.000|20110124183443.000|TR0|thinks about.
20110124183443.000|20110124183446.000|TR0|
20110124183446.000|20110124183448.000|TR0|VELSHI:  So if you didn't want cuts to any 
20110124183448.000|20110124183450.000|TR0|of those programs, which is generally how 
20110124183450.000|20110124183453.000|TR0|we operate, right?  We don't want to pay 
20110124183453.000|20110124183455.000|TR0|more taxes but we don't want cuts.  If we 
20110124183455.000|20110124183457.000|TR0|don't want cuts, according to these kinds 
20110124183457.000|20110124183459.000|TR0|of things, what's the alternative?
20110124183459.000|20110124183502.000|TR0|
20110124183502.000|20110124183504.000|TR0|Do you have to pay more taxes or the 
20110124183504.000|20110124183506.000|TR0|economy has to be roaring at such a speed 
20110124183506.000|20110124183509.000|TR0|that everybody's paying -- you may not pay 
20110124183509.000|20110124183511.000|TR0|more as a percentage but everybody's 
20110124183511.000|20110124183513.000|TR0|paying taxes?
20110124183513.000|20110124183516.000|TR0|
20110124183516.000|20110124183518.000|TR0|SAHADI:  I think it's -- this is why they 
20110124183518.000|20110124183520.000|TR0|call the budget unsustainable.  I don't 
20110124183520.000|20110124183523.000|TR0|think we can get by on eight cents of 
20110124183523.000|20110124183525.000|TR0|every tax dollar.  We're not at that point 
20110124183525.000|20110124183527.000|TR0|-- we're already in deficit. We're 
20110124183527.000|20110124183530.000|TR0|borrowing more so we only have 24 cents to 
20110124183530.000|20110124183532.000|TR0|pay for everything else.  But by eight 
20110124183532.000|20110124183534.000|TR0|cents you're really looking at some, you 
20110124183534.000|20110124183537.000|TR0|know, creditors may say, no, sorry.  Or, 
20110124183537.000|20110124183539.000|TR0|sure, we'll loan it to you at a much 
20110124183539.000|20110124183541.000|TR0|higher interest rate.  Which then makes 
20110124183541.000|20110124183544.000|TR0|your debt that much harder to beat (ph).
20110124183544.000|20110124183546.000|TR0|
20110124183546.000|20110124183548.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  Because that translates 
20110124183548.000|20110124183551.000|TR0|into all of the interest rates we all pay 
20110124183551.000|20110124183553.000|TR0|for everything.  Businesses that want to 
20110124183553.000|20110124183555.000|TR0|take loans, mortgages, student 
20110124183555.000|20110124183558.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE).  So everything becomes more 
20110124183558.000|20110124183600.000|TR0|expensive.
20110124183600.000|20110124183602.000|TR0|
20110124183602.000|20110124183605.000|TR0|SAHADI:  Right.
20110124183605.000|20110124183607.000|TR0|
20110124183607.000|20110124183609.000|TR0|VELSHI:  OK.  What does this calculation, 
20110124183609.000|20110124183611.000|TR0|the GAO that you've articulated for us.  
20110124183611.000|20110124183614.000|TR0|What implication does that have for 
20110124183614.000|20110124183616.000|TR0|lawmakers right now?
20110124183616.000|20110124183618.000|TR0|
20110124183618.000|20110124183621.000|TR0|SAHADI:  Well, Susan Irving, who's the 
20110124183621.000|20110124183623.000|TR0|head of federal budgeting analysis at the 
20110124183623.000|20110124183625.000|TR0|GAO is a very sensible woman, very calm 
20110124183625.000|20110124183628.000|TR0|when she says, she says, you know, both 
20110124183628.000|20110124183630.000|TR0|Americans and lawmakers need to ask some 
20110124183630.000|20110124183632.000|TR0|tough questions about our priorities.
20110124183632.000|20110124183635.000|TR0|
20110124183635.000|20110124183637.000|TR0|We either need to decide what we want 
20110124183637.000|20110124183639.000|TR0|government to do, figure out how much it 
20110124183639.000|20110124183642.000|TR0|costs and then ask whether we're willing 
20110124183642.000|20110124183644.000|TR0|to pay that.
20110124183644.000|20110124183646.000|TR0|
20110124183646.000|20110124183649.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.
20110124183649.000|20110124183651.000|TR0|
20110124183651.000|20110124183653.000|TR0|SAHADI:  Or we need to say how much money 
20110124183653.000|20110124183656.000|TR0|do we have, how much are we willing to pay 
20110124183656.000|20110124183658.000|TR0|and what can that buy us?  Those are the 
20110124183658.000|20110124183700.000|TR0|two questions that we need to ask 
20110124183700.000|20110124183703.000|TR0|ourselves.  And, you know, there's a lot 
20110124183703.000|20110124183705.000|TR0|of diverse opinion and it's kind of a 
20110124183705.000|20110124183707.000|TR0|national conversation we're not having.
20110124183707.000|20110124183710.000|TR0|
20110124183710.000|20110124183712.000|TR0|VELSHI:  I wonder whether the president's 
20110124183712.000|20110124183714.000|TR0|going to touch on that tomorrow in the 
20110124183714.000|20110124183717.000|TR0|State of the Union.
20110124183717.000|20110124183719.000|TR0|
20110124183719.000|20110124183721.000|TR0|SAHADI:  I don't know.  He hasn't called 
20110124183721.000|20110124183724.000|TR0|me so I don't know.
20110124183724.000|20110124183726.000|TR0|
20110124183726.000|20110124183728.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110124183728.000|20110124183730.000|TR0|
20110124183730.000|20110124183733.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right.  We'll keep a close 
20110124183733.000|20110124183735.000|TR0|eye out for it -- a close ear out for it.
20110124183735.000|20110124183737.000|TR0|
20110124183737.000|20110124183740.000|TR0|Jeanne, thanks very much.  Great 
20110124183740.000|20110124183742.000|TR0|description of very much specifically the 
20110124183742.000|20110124183744.000|TR0|problem we face.
20110124183744.000|20110124183747.000|TR0|
20110124183747.000|20110124183749.000|TR0|Tell everybody who didn't watch this, by 
20110124183749.000|20110124183751.000|TR0|the way, if you're watching this, to go to

20110124183754.000|20110124183756.000|TR0|It's listed on the site.

20110124183758.000|20110124183801.000|TR0|All right.  A stranger walks into a 
20110124183801.000|20110124183803.000|TR0|hospital, then walks out with somebody 
20110124183803.000|20110124183805.000|TR0|else's baby.  It happened in New York, 23 
20110124183805.000|20110124183808.000|TR0|years ago and believe it or not, it still 
20110124183808.000|20110124183810.000|TR0|happens today more often than you might 
20110124183810.000|20110124183812.000|TR0|think.  How parents can protect their 
20110124183812.000|20110124183815.000|TR0|newborns, next.

20110124183822.000|20110124183824.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Happening now, it looks like a 
20110124183824.000|20110124183826.000|TR0|former White House chief of staff Rahm 
20110124183826.000|20110124183829.000|TR0|Emanuel no longer the front-runner in the 
20110124183829.000|20110124183831.000|TR0|mayor race. That's because an appeals 
20110124183831.000|20110124183833.000|TR0|court ruled just moments ago that Emanuel 
20110124183833.000|20110124183836.000|TR0|isn't a Chicago resident.  The appeals 
20110124183836.000|20110124183838.000|TR0|court overturned a lower court's ruling 
20110124183838.000|20110124183840.000|TR0|that had cleared him to run.
20110124183840.000|20110124183842.000|TR0|
20110124183842.000|20110124183845.000|TR0|In Moscow, a bombing has killed at least 
20110124183845.000|20110124183847.000|TR0|35 people inside the city's busiest 
20110124183847.000|20110124183849.000|TR0|airport.  Russian officials say at least 
20110124183849.000|20110124183852.000|TR0|150 people are wounded in the apparent 
20110124183852.000|20110124183854.000|TR0|terrorist attack.  So far no confirmation 
20110124183854.000|20110124183856.000|TR0|of reports that this was a suicide bombing.
20110124183856.000|20110124183859.000|TR0|
20110124183859.000|20110124183901.000|TR0|And much of the nation is dealing with 
20110124183901.000|20110124183903.000|TR0|dangerously cold temperatures and 
20110124183903.000|20110124183906.000|TR0|wind-chills today.  And a storm heading up 
20110124183906.000|20110124183908.000|TR0|the east coast, could bring more snow and 
20110124183908.000|20110124183910.000|TR0|sleet and freezing rain to the northeast.  
20110124183910.000|20110124183913.000|TR0|Amtrak service between New York City and 
20110124183913.000|20110124183915.000|TR0|Albany is suspended today due to the 
20110124183915.000|20110124183917.000|TR0|extreme cold.

20110124183920.000|20110124183922.000|TR0|While the suspect in a 1987 baby 
20110124183922.000|20110124183924.000|TR0|kidnapping has reportedly confessed, court 
20110124183924.000|20110124183927.000|TR0|documents indicate that Ann Pettway 
20110124183927.000|20110124183929.000|TR0|admitted her guilt after turning herself 
20110124183929.000|20110124183931.000|TR0|into FBI agents yesterday.  According to 
20110124183931.000|20110124183934.000|TR0|the documents, she expressed sorrow for 
20110124183934.000|20110124183936.000|TR0|the pain that she's caused. Now 
20110124183936.000|20110124183938.000|TR0|investigators say Pettway snatched an 
20110124183938.000|20110124183941.000|TR0|infant from a New York City hospital 23 
20110124183941.000|20110124183943.000|TR0|years ago.  Then, raised the girl as her 
20110124183943.000|20110124183945.000|TR0|own daughter. Now a grown woman, Carlina 
20110124183945.000|20110124183948.000|TR0|White says she's always had a nagging 
20110124183948.000|20110124183950.000|TR0|feeling that Pettway wasn't her true birth 
20110124183950.000|20110124183952.000|TR0|mother.  She used an internet search to 
20110124183952.000|20110124183954.000|TR0|learn the identity of her real mother and 
20110124183954.000|20110124183957.000|TR0|the two were reunited earlier this month.
20110124183957.000|20110124183959.000|TR0|
20110124183959.000|20110124184001.000|TR0|Now babies are kidnapped from hospitals 
20110124184001.000|20110124184004.000|TR0|more frequently than you might expect.  
20110124184004.000|20110124184006.000|TR0|Senior medical correspondent Elizabeth 
20110124184006.000|20110124184008.000|TR0|Cohen has been looking into that.  She 
20110124184008.000|20110124184011.000|TR0|joins me now.
20110124184011.000|20110124184013.000|TR0|
20110124184013.000|20110124184015.000|TR0|Elizabeth, even in a hospital, you'd -- I 
20110124184015.000|20110124184018.000|TR0|mean, you'd think that that's the one 
20110124184018.000|20110124184020.000|TR0|place a parent can let down their guard, 
20110124184020.000|20110124184022.000|TR0|that everything's taken care of.
20110124184022.000|20110124184025.000|TR0|
20110124184025.000|20110124184027.000|TR0|You're telling me this isn't the case?
20110124184027.000|20110124184029.000|TR0|
20110124184029.000|20110124184032.000|TR0|ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL 
20110124184032.000|20110124184034.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  No, this isn't the case.  
20110124184034.000|20110124184036.000|TR0|And you would think that that would be the 
20110124184036.000|20110124184039.000|TR0|case. That you're in a hospital, there's 
20110124184039.000|20110124184041.000|TR0|all these doctors and nurses around.  The 
20110124184041.000|20110124184043.000|TR0|problem is, is that sometimes people 
20110124184043.000|20110124184046.000|TR0|pretend to be doctors or nurses.
20110124184046.000|20110124184048.000|TR0|
20110124184048.000|20110124184050.000|TR0|And in fact, take a look at this video, 
20110124184050.000|20110124184053.000|TR0|Ali.  This is really -- I found it very 
20110124184053.000|20110124184055.000|TR0|disconcerting.  See this woman walking 
20110124184055.000|20110124184057.000|TR0|back and forth? She does this for quite a 
20110124184057.000|20110124184100.000|TR0|while -- the woman in the black shorts and 
20110124184100.000|20110124184102.000|TR0|the white top.  And then you can see her, 
20110124184102.000|20110124184104.000|TR0|she walks in, she changes into nurse's 
20110124184104.000|20110124184107.000|TR0|scrubs -- that's the same woman -- she 
20110124184107.000|20110124184109.000|TR0|just changed her shirt so she'd look like 
20110124184109.000|20110124184111.000|TR0|a nurse.  She goes into that room and 
20110124184111.000|20110124184113.000|TR0|watch her come out with a bag under her 
20110124184113.000|20110124184116.000|TR0|arm.  A baby is in that bag and that's how 
20110124184116.000|20110124184118.000|TR0|she managed to get away with it.
20110124184118.000|20110124184120.000|TR0|
20110124184120.000|20110124184123.000|TR0|Now here you can see the hospital 
20110124184123.000|20110124184125.000|TR0|personnel saying, oh my gosh, we've had an 
20110124184125.000|20110124184127.000|TR0|abduction, what do we do?  And they did 
20110124184127.000|20110124184130.000|TR0|get that baby back.  And, Ali, in most 
20110124184130.000|20110124184132.000|TR0|cases, they do get the baby back.  There 
20110124184132.000|20110124184134.000|TR0|are only five case where they can't find 
20110124184134.000|20110124184137.000|TR0|that baby.  There were six, of course, 
20110124184137.000|20110124184139.000|TR0|until Carlina White came forward and found 
20110124184139.000|20110124184141.000|TR0|her parents -- Ali.
20110124184141.000|20110124184144.000|TR0|
20110124184144.000|20110124184146.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right.  Is there some profile 
20110124184146.000|20110124184148.000|TR0|as to who these people are, who kidnapped 
20110124184148.000|20110124184151.000|TR0|other people's babies from hospitals?
20110124184151.000|20110124184153.000|TR0|
20110124184153.000|20110124184155.000|TR0|COHEN:  Yes, there is a profile.  It 
20110124184155.000|20110124184158.000|TR0|usually is a woman.  And it's usually 
20110124184158.000|20110124184200.000|TR0|someone who lives near the hospital.  And 
20110124184200.000|20110124184202.000|TR0|it's also someone who has lost a baby or 
20110124184202.000|20110124184205.000|TR0|can't have one and is in a very difficult 
20110124184205.000|20110124184207.000|TR0|relationship.
20110124184207.000|20110124184209.000|TR0|
20110124184209.000|20110124184212.000|TR0|Now, I want to add here, Ali, that this is 
20110124184212.000|20110124184214.000|TR0|unusual.  I mean, since 1983, there have 
20110124184214.000|20110124184216.000|TR0|been 128 cases.  There are fewer and fewer 
20110124184216.000|20110124184219.000|TR0|as hospitals get smarter about how to 
20110124184219.000|20110124184221.000|TR0|safeguard against them.  In 2010, there 
20110124184221.000|20110124184223.000|TR0|was one case of an infant being abducted 
20110124184223.000|20110124184225.000|TR0|from a hospital.  The year before there 
20110124184225.000|20110124184228.000|TR0|were three cases.  So parents shouldn't be 
20110124184228.000|20110124184230.000|TR0|incredibly panicked about this, but it is 
20110124184230.000|20110124184232.000|TR0|something you want to keep in mind.
20110124184232.000|20110124184235.000|TR0|
20110124184235.000|20110124184237.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right.  But it's probably -- is 
20110124184237.000|20110124184239.000|TR0|there something that you can do fairly 
20110124184239.000|20110124184242.000|TR0|simple without being panicked about it to 
20110124184242.000|20110124184244.000|TR0|just sort of ensure against your child's 
20110124184244.000|20110124184246.000|TR0|abduction when you're not with them in the 
20110124184246.000|20110124184249.000|TR0|hospital?
20110124184249.000|20110124184251.000|TR0|
20110124184251.000|20110124184253.000|TR0|COHEN:  Right, Ali, there certainly is.  
20110124184253.000|20110124184256.000|TR0|And here's the reason why.  More than half 
20110124184256.000|20110124184258.000|TR0|of the abductions are from the mother's 
20110124184258.000|20110124184300.000|TR0|own room. So you can -- while the baby is 
20110124184300.000|20110124184303.000|TR0|in the room, that seems to be a 
20110124184303.000|20110124184305.000|TR0|particularly vulnerable time.
20110124184305.000|20110124184307.000|TR0|
20110124184307.000|20110124184310.000|TR0|So here's a tip.  Never leave the baby 
20110124184310.000|20110124184312.000|TR0|alone.  You think, oh I'm just going to 
20110124184312.000|20110124184314.000|TR0|run into the bathroom, I'll be right out.  
20110124184314.000|20110124184317.000|TR0|That's not OK.  Call a nurse, ask them to 
20110124184317.000|20110124184319.000|TR0|stay with the baby while you're in the 
20110124184319.000|20110124184321.000|TR0|bathroom.
20110124184321.000|20110124184324.000|TR0|
20110124184324.000|20110124184326.000|TR0|Ask everyone for ID.  I know, having had 
20110124184326.000|20110124184328.000|TR0|four children, there are people flooding 
20110124184328.000|20110124184331.000|TR0|in and out.  Ask people, look for IDs, 
20110124184331.000|20110124184333.000|TR0|make sure you know why everyone's there.
20110124184333.000|20110124184335.000|TR0|
20110124184335.000|20110124184338.000|TR0|Also, be careful with tests.  Some of 
20110124184338.000|20110124184340.000|TR0|these abductions happen when someone says, 
20110124184340.000|20110124184342.000|TR0|oh, I've got to take this baby to go have 
20110124184342.000|20110124184344.000|TR0|a test. Well, you should ask, what test?  
20110124184344.000|20110124184347.000|TR0|If you haven't heard of a test being 
20110124184347.000|20110124184349.000|TR0|needed, you should say what doctor ordered 
20110124184349.000|20110124184351.000|TR0|this?  And really question people.  You're 
20110124184351.000|20110124184354.000|TR0|allowed to do that.  As a matter of fact, 
20110124184354.000|20110124184356.000|TR0|you should do that.  You don't have to say 
20110124184356.000|20110124184358.000|TR0|yes to everyone.  Ask questions.
20110124184358.000|20110124184401.000|TR0|
20110124184401.000|20110124184403.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right.  Elizabeth, 
20110124184403.000|20110124184405.000|TR0|interesting topic.  I really wouldn't have 
20110124184405.000|20110124184408.000|TR0|known that this was as common of a 
20110124184408.000|20110124184410.000|TR0|situation as you've brought to our 
20110124184410.000|20110124184412.000|TR0|attention.
20110124184412.000|20110124184415.000|TR0|
20110124184415.000|20110124184417.000|TR0|Thanks for doing that.
20110124184417.000|20110124184419.000|TR0|
20110124184419.000|20110124184422.000|TR0|COHEN:  Thanks.

20110124184431.000|20110124184433.000|TR0|Speaking of kids, are your innovators?  Do 
20110124184433.000|20110124184436.000|TR0|they have ideas that could change the 
20110124184436.000|20110124184438.000|TR0|world?  Well, if they do, stick around for 
20110124184438.000|20110124184440.000|TR0|two minutes to hear how to get them a 
20110124184440.000|20110124184443.000|TR0|$50,000 scholarship or a trip to the

20110124184450.000|20110124184452.000|TR0|
20110124184452.000|20110124184454.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Well, heated debates are nothing 
20110124184454.000|20110124184456.000|TR0|new in the Middle East, but the latest 
20110124184456.000|20110124184459.000|TR0|uproar involving Israel and the 
20110124184459.000|20110124184501.000|TR0|Palestinians has something of new twist to 
20110124184501.000|20110124184503.000|TR0|it.
20110124184503.000|20110124184506.000|TR0|
20110124184506.000|20110124184508.000|TR0|In a stunning move, Palestinian officials 
20110124184508.000|20110124184510.000|TR0|apparently agreed to seed (ph) large 
20110124184510.000|20110124184513.000|TR0|tracks of East Jerusalem to Israel.  
20110124184513.000|20110124184515.000|TR0|That's according to the alleged secret 
20110124184515.000|20110124184517.000|TR0|documents on the negotiations leaked by 
20110124184517.000|20110124184520.000|TR0|the Arabic TV network al Jazeera.  The 
20110124184520.000|20110124184522.000|TR0|network has dubbed the document "The 
20110124184522.000|20110124184524.000|TR0|Palestine Papers."  It says that more than 
20110124184524.000|20110124184527.000|TR0|1,600 confidential records of meetings, 
20110124184527.000|20110124184529.000|TR0|e-mails and other documents between the 
20110124184529.000|20110124184531.000|TR0|Palestinian, Israeli, and U.S. officials 
20110124184531.000|20110124184534.000|TR0|covering the years 2000 to 2010.
20110124184534.000|20110124184536.000|TR0|
20110124184536.000|20110124184538.000|TR0|A top Palestinian official accuses al 
20110124184538.000|20110124184541.000|TR0|Jazeera of a smear campaign.  The alleged 
20110124184541.000|20110124184543.000|TR0|Palestinian offer said to have been made 
20110124184543.000|20110124184545.000|TR0|in 2008.  In a later document from last 
20110124184545.000|20110124184548.000|TR0|year, the chief Palestinian negotiator is 
20110124184548.000|20110124184550.000|TR0|quoted as telling a U.S. State Department 
20110124184550.000|20110124184552.000|TR0|official that the offer would give Israel 
20110124184552.000|20110124184555.000|TR0|the biggest Jerusalem in Jewish history. 
20110124184555.000|20110124184557.000|TR0|Israel has occupied the West Bank, 
20110124184557.000|20110124184559.000|TR0|including East Jerusalem since 1967.  The 
20110124184559.000|20110124184602.000|TR0|office of Prime Minister Benjamin 
20110124184602.000|20110124184604.000|TR0|Netanyahu is declining comment on this.

20110124184606.000|20110124184608.000|TR0|In Italy, American Amanda Knox is said to 
20110124184608.000|20110124184611.000|TR0|be cautiously optimistic as she begins her 
20110124184611.000|20110124184613.000|TR0|appeal of her murder conviction.  You'll 
20110124184613.000|20110124184615.000|TR0|recall she was convicted two years ago of 
20110124184615.000|20110124184618.000|TR0|sexual assault and the murder of her 
20110124184618.000|20110124184620.000|TR0|British roommate.  Two forensic experts 
20110124184620.000|20110124184622.000|TR0|were sworn in Saturday in advance of their 
20110124184622.000|20110124184625.000|TR0|retest of two forensic experts from Knox's 
20110124184625.000|20110124184627.000|TR0|trial.  Knox's former boyfriend was also 
20110124184627.000|20110124184629.000|TR0|convicted in the killing of Meredith 
20110124184629.000|20110124184632.000|TR0|Kercher.

20110124184634.000|20110124184636.000|TR0|And it is 44 minutes after the hour.  Time 
20110124184636.000|20110124184639.000|TR0|to check in on the developing stories that 
20110124184639.000|20110124184641.000|TR0|we're watching for you right now.

20110124184643.000|20110124184646.000|TR0|It looks like former White House chief of 
20110124184646.000|20110124184648.000|TR0|staff Rahm Emanuel is no longer the 
20110124184648.000|20110124184650.000|TR0|frontrunner in Chicago's mayoral race.  
20110124184650.000|20110124184653.000|TR0|That's because an appeals court ruled 
20110124184653.000|20110124184655.000|TR0|moments ago that Emanuel is not a Chicago 
20110124184655.000|20110124184657.000|TR0|resident.  The appeal's court overturned 
20110124184657.000|20110124184700.000|TR0|the lower court's ruling that had cleared 
20110124184700.000|20110124184702.000|TR0|Emanuel to run.
20110124184702.000|20110124184704.000|TR0|
20110124184704.000|20110124184707.000|TR0|And security at airports and 
20110124184707.000|20110124184709.000|TR0|transportation hubs in Moscow is being 
20110124184709.000|20110124184711.000|TR0|stepped up right now in the wake a bombing 
20110124184711.000|20110124184714.000|TR0|at the busiest airport in the city.  At 
20110124184714.000|20110124184716.000|TR0|latest count, 35 are dead, more than 150 
20110124184716.000|20110124184718.000|TR0|injured.  The blast ripped through the 
20110124184718.000|20110124184721.000|TR0|entrance of the international arrival 
20110124184721.000|20110124184723.000|TR0|section of the Domodedovo Airport.  Much 
20110124184723.000|20110124184725.000|TR0|more during the course of the day.

20110124184727.000|20110124184730.000|TR0|OK.  I like these types of challenges.

20110124184748.000|20110124184751.000|TR0|Joining me now for more on the science 
20110124184751.000|20110124184753.000|TR0|fairs, Tom.  He's  the director of product 
20110124184753.000|20110124184755.000|TR0|marketing for Google apps and enterprises. 
20110124184755.000|20110124184758.000|TR0| Tom, thanks for joining us  Good to see 
20110124184758.000|20110124184800.000|TR0|you.

20110124184802.000|20110124184805.000|TR0|TOM OLIVERI, DIRECTOR OF PRODUCT 
20110124184805.000|20110124184807.000|TR0|MARKETING, GOOGLE APPS AND ENTERPRISE:  
20110124184807.000|20110124184809.000|TR0|Thanks, Ali, for having us on the show. 
20110124184809.000|20110124184812.000|TR0|Excited to be here.
20110124184812.000|20110124184814.000|TR0|
20110124184814.000|20110124184816.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Right behind you is the product 
20110124184816.000|20110124184819.000|TR0|or prototype of the product that came out 
20110124184819.000|20110124184821.000|TR0|of an exhibition, out of the X-Prize 
20110124184821.000|20110124184823.000|TR0|spaceship that was born out of an X-prize. 
20110124184823.000|20110124184826.000|TR0| I know it's something that Google's 
20110124184826.000|20110124184828.000|TR0|founders are very close to.  Tell me about 
20110124184828.000|20110124184830.000|TR0|what this is meant to be, what this 
20110124184830.000|20110124184833.000|TR0|competition is meant to do.
20110124184833.000|20110124184835.000|TR0|
20110124184835.000|20110124184837.000|TR0|OLIVERI:  Thank you.  Yes.  We're very 
20110124184837.000|20110124184839.000|TR0|excited about science and about how 
20110124184839.000|20110124184842.000|TR0|science can change the world.  If you 
20110124184842.000|20110124184844.000|TR0|think about Google, it actually started 
20110124184844.000|20110124184846.000|TR0|with a big idea.  Our founders had an idea 
20110124184846.000|20110124184849.000|TR0|that science could change the world in the 
20110124184849.000|20110124184851.000|TR0|way people organize information.
20110124184851.000|20110124184853.000|TR0|
20110124184853.000|20110124184856.000|TR0|And we think there are countless ideas 
20110124184856.000|20110124184858.000|TR0|like that that students around the world 
20110124184858.000|20110124184900.000|TR0|have today.  Our hope is that a program 
20110124184900.000|20110124184903.000|TR0|like this could help those students unlock 
20110124184903.000|20110124184905.000|TR0|those ideas using the Web.
20110124184905.000|20110124184907.000|TR0|
20110124184907.000|20110124184910.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right.  For someone who's 
20110124184910.000|20110124184912.000|TR0|watching this who thinks they've got a 
20110124184912.000|20110124184914.000|TR0|smart kid, how smart do you have to be?  
20110124184914.000|20110124184917.000|TR0|What kinds of things are you looking for:
20110124184917.000|20110124184919.000|TR0|
20110124184919.000|20110124184921.000|TR0|OLIVERI:  You know, there's a range of 
20110124184921.000|20110124184924.000|TR0|ideas that students can participate in.  
20110124184924.000|20110124184926.000|TR0|Everything from computer science and earth 
20110124184926.000|20110124184928.000|TR0|science to physics and chemistry.  We have 
20110124184928.000|20110124184931.000|TR0|different age groups as well.  So, if 
20110124184931.000|20110124184933.000|TR0|you're between the ages of 13 and 18, 
20110124184933.000|20110124184935.000|TR0|there's the enormous opportunity to 
20110124184935.000|20110124184938.000|TR0|participate.
20110124184938.000|20110124184940.000|TR0|
20110124184940.000|20110124184942.000|TR0|We get a lot of inspiration from the 
20110124184942.000|20110124184945.000|TR0|students that we worked with to help build 
20110124184945.000|20110124184947.000|TR0|this program.  As an example, Tesca (ph) 
20110124184947.000|20110124184949.000|TR0|Fitzgerald is a 14-year-old from Oregon 
20110124184949.000|20110124184951.000|TR0|who has been very passionate about 
20110124184951.000|20110124184954.000|TR0|artificial intelligence.  In her case, she 
20110124184954.000|20110124184956.000|TR0|was thinking about how nurses spend close 
20110124184956.000|20110124184958.000|TR0|to half their time to date restocking 
20110124184958.000|20110124185001.000|TR0|shelves in hospitals. And she was thinking 
20110124185001.000|20110124185003.000|TR0|you know, it could be great if those 
20110124185003.000|20110124185005.000|TR0|people could spend that time with their 
20110124185005.000|20110124185008.000|TR0|patients direction.
20110124185008.000|20110124185010.000|TR0|
20110124185010.000|20110124185012.000|TR0|So, she took her interest in artificial 
20110124185012.000|20110124185015.000|TR0|intelligence and in robotics to help 
20110124185015.000|20110124185017.000|TR0|create a way to help create a way for 
20110124185017.000|20110124185019.000|TR0|those robots to help restock supplies in 
20110124185019.000|20110124185022.000|TR0|hospitals and give those nurses a chance 
20110124185022.000|20110124185024.000|TR0|to spend that time instead with patients.  
20110124185024.000|20110124185026.000|TR0|There's a wide range of possibilities here 
20110124185026.000|20110124185029.000|TR0|across a big range of topics where 
20110124185029.000|20110124185031.000|TR0|students can dream and help create the 
20110124185031.000|20110124185033.000|TR0|future through their scientific vision.
20110124185033.000|20110124185036.000|TR0|
20110124185036.000|20110124185038.000|TR0|VELSHI:  All right.  But Google is one of 
20110124185038.000|20110124185040.000|TR0|those companies that employs real talented 
20110124185040.000|20110124185043.000|TR0|engineers.  What is it that somebody who's 
20110124185043.000|20110124185045.000|TR0|in high school could possibly tell you 
20110124185045.000|20110124185047.000|TR0|that one of your engineers hasn't? I mean, 
20110124185047.000|20110124185050.000|TR0|are you looking for ideas that you can 
20110124185050.000|20110124185052.000|TR0|actually use or somebody could actually 
20110124185052.000|20110124185054.000|TR0|invent, or just looking to stimulate how 
20110124185054.000|20110124185057.000|TR0|high school students think about things, 
20110124185057.000|20110124185059.000|TR0|which wouldn't be a bad goal in and of 
20110124185059.000|20110124185101.000|TR0|itself.  But what are you hoping to 
20110124185101.000|20110124185104.000|TR0|achieve?
20110124185104.000|20110124185106.000|TR0|
20110124185106.000|20110124185108.000|TR0|OLIVERI:  Well, I hope first to help 
20110124185108.000|20110124185110.000|TR0|students engage in the scientific 
20110124185110.000|20110124185113.000|TR0|discovery process.  We think they can 
20110124185113.000|20110124185115.000|TR0|benefit tremendously from that, and we 
20110124185115.000|20110124185117.000|TR0|want to give them twenty-first century 
20110124185117.000|20110124185120.000|TR0|tools to explore twenty-first century  
20110124185120.000|20110124185122.000|TR0|problems.  And we have a lot of confidence 
20110124185122.000|20110124185124.000|TR0|in the next generation.  There are big 
20110124185124.000|20110124185127.000|TR0|problems that we face, and we think 
20110124185127.000|20110124185129.000|TR0|students like Tesca, who I mentioned, can 
20110124185129.000|20110124185131.000|TR0|help dream and solve those problems.
20110124185131.000|20110124185134.000|TR0|
20110124185134.000|20110124185136.000|TR0|The other thing that struck us is if you 
20110124185136.000|20110124185138.000|TR0|look at science fairs today, they have not 
20110124185138.000|20110124185141.000|TR0|changed much in the past 90 years.  
20110124185141.000|20110124185143.000|TR0|Students are still going to gymnasiums, 
20110124185143.000|20110124185145.000|TR0|they are still using poster boards and 
20110124185145.000|20110124185148.000|TR0|paper and glue to describe their ideas.  
20110124185148.000|20110124185150.000|TR0|And we thought there's an opportunity to 
20110124185150.000|20110124185152.000|TR0|use the Web to reach a much bigger 
20110124185152.000|20110124185155.000|TR0|audience of students around the world and 
20110124185155.000|20110124185157.000|TR0|also to help them describe those ideas in 
20110124185157.000|20110124185159.000|TR0|ways that go deeper.
20110124185159.000|20110124185202.000|TR0|
20110124185202.000|20110124185204.000|TR0|So, for example, you can research your 
20110124185204.000|20110124185206.000|TR0|ideas online, you can use Google Docs, a 
20110124185206.000|20110124185209.000|TR0|spreadsheet application that allows you to 
20110124185209.000|20110124185211.000|TR0|describe the data more completely.  You 
20110124185211.000|20110124185213.000|TR0|can describe your ideas and the results 
20110124185213.000|20110124185216.000|TR0|you've achieved to the world on YouTube.  
20110124185216.000|20110124185218.000|TR0|There are a lot of ways that the Web can 
20110124185218.000|20110124185220.000|TR0|make this a richer experience for the 
20110124185220.000|20110124185222.000|TR0|student.
20110124185222.000|20110124185225.000|TR0|
20110124185225.000|20110124185227.000|TR0|VELSHI:  And, Tom, on the screen it says 
20110124185227.000|20110124185229.000|TR0|your kid's $50,000 idea. $50,000 is the 
20110124185229.000|20110124185232.000|TR0|top prize that you can win?
20110124185232.000|20110124185234.000|TR0|
20110124185234.000|20110124185236.000|TR0|OLIVERI:  The grand prize winner has 
20110124185236.000|20110124185239.000|TR0|access to a $50,000 scholarship as well as 
20110124185239.000|20110124185241.000|TR0|their choice of a number of different 
20110124185241.000|20110124185243.000|TR0|experiences that even create a richer 
20110124185243.000|20110124185246.000|TR0|scientific experience for them.
20110124185246.000|20110124185248.000|TR0|
20110124185248.000|20110124185250.000|TR0|As an example, Lego has provided a 
20110124185250.000|20110124185253.000|TR0|one-week internship where the student can 
20110124185253.000|20110124185255.000|TR0|work with scientists there to dream up 
20110124185255.000|20110124185257.000|TR0|next-generation toys and gadgets.  
20110124185257.000|20110124185300.000|TR0|National Geographic is helping the student 
20110124185300.000|20110124185302.000|TR0|and his or her parent go to the Galapagos 
20110124185302.000|20110124185304.000|TR0|Islands and explore that firsthand. CERN 
20110124185304.000|20110124185307.000|TR0|(ph) is actually opening up their 
20110124185307.000|20110124185309.000|TR0|scientific laboratory for a week and 
20110124185309.000|20110124185311.000|TR0|helping the student work with scientists 
20110124185311.000|20110124185314.000|TR0|there is to do physics research.
20110124185314.000|20110124185316.000|TR0|
20110124185316.000|20110124185318.000|TR0|So, a lot of exciting prizes.  We're 
20110124185318.000|20110124185321.000|TR0|hopeful that will inspire kids to get 
20110124185321.000|20110124185323.000|TR0|involved and dream big.
20110124185323.000|20110124185325.000|TR0|
20110124185325.000|20110124185328.000|TR0|VELSHI: All right, Tom.  And by the way, 
20110124185328.000|20110124185330.000|TR0|behind you as I was referring to, the 
20110124185330.000|20110124185332.000|TR0|full-scale replica of Spaceship One, which 
20110124185332.000|20110124185335.000|TR0|was the winner of - I'm sorry, the 
20110124185335.000|20110124185337.000|TR0|X-Prize.  So , this is ideas of incentive

20110124185421.000|20110124185423.000|TR0|political front.  Former Republican 
20110124185423.000|20110124185426.000|TR0|presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani is 
20110124185426.000|20110124185428.000|TR0|Piers Morgan's guest tonight on CNN.  You 
20110124185428.000|20110124185430.000|TR0|obviously remember America's Mayor, the 
20110124185430.000|20110124185433.000|TR0|mayor of New York during 2001 -- 9/11,

20110124185444.000|20110124185447.000|TR0|TONIGHT":  Would you be more tempted to 
20110124185447.000|20110124185449.000|TR0|run if she wasn't?
20110124185449.000|20110124185451.000|TR0|
20110124185451.000|20110124185453.000|TR0|RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL 
20110124185453.000|20110124185456.000|TR0|CANDIDATE:  Maybe the opposite.
20110124185456.000|20110124185458.000|TR0|
20110124185458.000|20110124185500.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Really?

20110124185503.000|20110124185505.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Yes.  Maybe the opposite.  
20110124185505.000|20110124185507.000|TR0|Because, you know, my one chance -- if I 
20110124185507.000|20110124185510.000|TR0|have a chance, is that -- I'm considered a 
20110124185510.000|20110124185512.000|TR0|moderate Republican.
20110124185512.000|20110124185514.000|TR0|
20110124185514.000|20110124185517.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Yes.

20110124185519.000|20110124185521.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  So, the more Republicans in 
20110124185521.000|20110124185524.000|TR0|which I can show a contrast, probably the 
20110124185524.000|20110124185526.000|TR0|better chance -- the better chance that I 
20110124185526.000|20110124185528.000|TR0|have.
20110124185528.000|20110124185531.000|TR0|
20110124185531.000|20110124185533.000|TR0|MORGAN:  So, you've been the acceptable 
20110124185533.000|20110124185535.000|TR0|face of the Republican party.
20110124185535.000|20110124185538.000|TR0|

20110124185549.000|20110124185552.000|TR0|I got elected mayor of New York City was 
20110124185552.000|20110124185554.000|TR0|not being acceptable.  My slogan was, you 
20110124185554.000|20110124185556.000|TR0|can't do any worse.

20110124185654.000|20110124185657.000|TR0|"Magic Trip."  I can't even get the word 
20110124185657.000|20110124185659.000|TR0|"trip" out of my mouth fast enough!

20110124185706.000|20110124185708.000|TR0|VELSHI:  That's right.  It's a bit of - a 
20110124185708.000|20110124185711.000|TR0|film about a trip.  It documents Ken 
20110124185711.000|20110124185713.000|TR0|Casey, the author of "One Flew Over the 
20110124185713.000|20110124185715.000|TR0|Cuckoo's Nest" and his 1964 trip across 
20110124185715.000|20110124185718.000|TR0|America on LSD.  Alex, how did you make a 
20110124185718.000|20110124185720.000|TR0|film out of a trip that was sort of 
20110124185720.000|20110124185722.000|TR0|designed to be kind of incoherent?
20110124185722.000|20110124185724.000|TR0|
20110124185724.000|20110124185727.000|TR0|ALEX GIBNEY, CO-DIRECTOR, "MAGIC TRIP":  I 
20110124185727.000|20110124185729.000|TR0|don't know.  It was kind of organized 
20110124185729.000|20110124185731.000|TR0|chaos in some ways.  What was magnificent 
20110124185731.000|20110124185734.000|TR0|is they filmed it.  They filmed it with 
20110124185734.000|20110124185736.000|TR0|these wonderful,  very lightweight cameras 
20110124185736.000|20110124185738.000|TR0|in 16-millimeter color.  It had been 
20110124185738.000|20110124185741.000|TR0|collecting dust in cans for many, many 
20110124185741.000|20110124185743.000|TR0|years. And Alison Elwood and I recovered 
20110124185743.000|20110124185745.000|TR0|it and brought it back to life.  It's a 
20110124185745.000|20110124185748.000|TR0|pretty fun ride.
20110124185748.000|20110124185750.000|TR0|
20110124185750.000|20110124185752.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Why did you?  What made you think 
20110124185752.000|20110124185755.000|TR0|that just because they filmed it, that 
20110124185755.000|20110124185757.000|TR0|this would make an interesting film?
20110124185757.000|20110124185759.000|TR0|
20110124185759.000|20110124185802.000|TR0|GIBNEY:  You know, it's kind of an origin 
20110124185802.000|20110124185804.000|TR0|story.  Everybody -- this isn't the '60s 
20110124185804.000|20110124185806.000|TR0|that has become kind of the stereotype, 
20110124185806.000|20110124185809.000|TR0|the Haight-Ashbury summer of love, 
20110124185809.000|20110124185811.000|TR0|long-hair kind of thing.  This is a 
20110124185811.000|20110124185813.000|TR0|moment.  Kind of one foot in the 1950s 
20110124185813.000|20110124185816.000|TR0|era, you know, sort of like the period of 
20110124185816.000|20110124185818.000|TR0|"Mad Men."  And then one foot in the '60s 
20110124185818.000|20110124185820.000|TR0|that was about to become.
20110124185820.000|20110124185823.000|TR0|
20110124185823.000|20110124185825.000|TR0|So, this trip really marked the beginning 
20110124185825.000|20110124185827.000|TR0|of a new era.  They were going to New York 
20110124185827.000|20110124185830.000|TR0|World's Fair to see Tomorrowland, this 
20110124185830.000|20110124185832.000|TR0|kind of corporate vision of the future, it 
20110124185832.000|20110124185834.000|TR0|was at the World's Fair.  And it turns out 
20110124185834.000|20110124185836.000|TR0|when they got there that was the vision of 
20110124185836.000|20110124185839.000|TR0|the past, and the vision ever the future 
20110124185839.000|20110124185841.000|TR0|was on that bus.  And so, that was 
20110124185841.000|20110124185843.000|TR0|interesting to me.  It's kind of an origin 
20110124185843.000|20110124185846.000|TR0|story.
20110124185846.000|20110124185848.000|TR0|
20110124185848.000|20110124185850.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Talk to me about the magic bus.
20110124185850.000|20110124185853.000|TR0|
20110124185853.000|20110124185855.000|TR0|GIBNEY:  Well, the bus itself -- I mean, 
20110124185855.000|20110124185857.000|TR0|this was designed to be a kind of caravan 
20110124185857.000|20110124185900.000|TR0|of dreams.  They had in the refrigerator, 
20110124185900.000|20110124185902.000|TR0|which was on the bus, was a pitcher of 
20110124185902.000|20110124185904.000|TR0|orange juice laced with LSD.  They had all 
20110124185904.000|20110124185907.000|TR0|sorts of sound equipment so they could 
20110124185907.000|20110124185909.000|TR0|blast music to people as they went by and 
20110124185909.000|20110124185911.000|TR0|also cameras and recording equipment.
20110124185911.000|20110124185914.000|TR0|
20110124185914.000|20110124185916.000|TR0|You know, one of the things they wanted to 
20110124185916.000|20110124185918.000|TR0|do is there was a sense by Ken Casey that 
20110124185918.000|20110124185921.000|TR0|particularly after the Kennedy 
20110124185921.000|20110124185923.000|TR0|assassination and out of the Red Scare, 
20110124185923.000|20110124185925.000|TR0|that fear was abroad in the land.  And 
20110124185925.000|20110124185928.000|TR0|their idea was to tootle through towns and 
20110124185928.000|20110124185930.000|TR0|bring people out of the bomb shelters, 
20110124185930.000|20110124185932.000|TR0|into the streets, to have fun.
20110124185932.000|20110124185935.000|TR0|
