20110124130007.000|20110124130009.000|TR0|T.J. HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR:  Hi, everybody.  
20110124130009.000|20110124130011.000|TR0|Top of the hour here on this January the 
20110124130011.000|20110124130014.000|TR0|24th.  Glad you could be with us on this 
20110124130014.000|20110124130016.000|TR0|AMERICAN MORNING. I'm T.J. Holmes.
20110124130016.000|20110124130018.000|TR0|
20110124130018.000|20110124130021.000|TR0|KIRAN CHETRY, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm Kiran 
20110124130021.000|20110124130023.000|TR0|Chetry.  We have a lot of top stories to 
20110124130023.000|20110124130025.000|TR0|tell you about.  First though, the woman 
20110124130025.000|20110124130028.000|TR0|who was accused posing as a nurse and 
20110124130028.000|20110124130030.000|TR0|stealing an infant from her mother 23 
20110124130030.000|20110124130032.000|TR0|years ago.  Today that suspect will be in 
20110124130032.000|20110124130035.000|TR0|court facing federal kidnapping charges.
20110124130035.000|20110124130037.000|TR0|
20110124130037.000|20110124130039.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Also, parents out there, how 
20110124130039.000|20110124130042.000|TR0|would you feel if your child came home 
20110124130042.000|20110124130044.000|TR0|with a report card showing you the child's 
20110124130044.000|20110124130046.000|TR0|grades, but also your grade?  Yes. 
20110124130046.000|20110124130049.000|TR0|Teachers are grading you on how well you 
20110124130049.000|20110124130051.000|TR0|parent.  We'll tell you what state is 
20110124130051.000|20110124130053.000|TR0|proposing this, and why some states, it's 
20110124130053.000|20110124130056.000|TR0|a pretty good idea, and other states, this 
20110124130056.000|20110124130058.000|TR0|is the dumbest thing they've ever heard.
20110124130058.000|20110124130100.000|TR0|
20110124130100.000|20110124130103.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And it seems like the airlines 
20110124130103.000|20110124130105.000|TR0|have found another way to nickel and dime 
20110124130105.000|20110124130108.000|TR0|you.  Hold on to your wallet.  There's 
20110124130108.000|20110124130110.000|TR0|still room for more fees.  We're going to 
20110124130110.000|20110124130112.000|TR0|break down some of the new charges that 
20110124130112.000|20110124130115.000|TR0|you could see when you take to the skies 
20110124130115.000|20110124130117.000|TR0|in the near future.
20110124130117.000|20110124130119.000|TR0|
20110124130119.000|20110124130122.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Also, a lot of people stayed up 
20110124130122.000|20110124130124.000|TR0|to watch the final four of football last 
20110124130124.000|20110124130126.000|TR0|night. .  One quarterback is getting 
20110124130126.000|20110124130129.000|TR0|criticized for quitting on his team.  
20110124130129.000|20110124130131.000|TR0|We'll show you the tweets that question 
20110124130131.000|20110124130133.000|TR0|his toughness, coming up.
20110124130133.000|20110124130136.000|TR0|
20110124130136.000|20110124130138.000|TR0|CHETRY:  We start, though, with new 
20110124130138.000|20110124130140.000|TR0|developments in a story that had everyone 
20110124130140.000|20110124130143.000|TR0|talking last week, an accused kidnapper 
20110124130143.000|20110124130145.000|TR0|under arrest and due in court later today.
20110124130145.000|20110124130147.000|TR0|
20110124130147.000|20110124130150.000|TR0|HOLMES:  She's suspected of snatching 
20110124130150.000|20110124130152.000|TR0|Carlina White back in 1987 from a hospital 
20110124130152.000|20110124130154.000|TR0|and then raising the child on her own.  
20110124130154.000|20110124130157.000|TR0|You're seeing a video, a picture there of 
20110124130157.000|20110124130159.000|TR0|the actual suspect.
20110124130159.000|20110124130202.000|TR0|
20110124130202.000|20110124130204.000|TR0|Our Susan Candiotti is following the story 
20110124130204.000|20110124130206.000|TR0|for us.
20110124130206.000|20110124130209.000|TR0|
20110124130209.000|20110124130211.000|TR0|SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN NATIONAL 
20110124130211.000|20110124130213.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you.
20110124130213.000|20110124130216.000|TR0|
20110124130216.000|20110124130218.000|TR0|You know, that baby was only 19 days old 
20110124130218.000|20110124130220.000|TR0|when she was stolen from that hospital.  
20110124130220.000|20110124130223.000|TR0|CNN broke the news of Ann Pettway's 
20110124130223.000|20110124130225.000|TR0|surrender to the FBI on Sunday.  She'll 
20110124130225.000|20110124130227.000|TR0|face a federal judge on kidnapping charges 
20110124130227.000|20110124130230.000|TR0|today.
20110124130230.000|20110124130232.000|TR0|
20110124130232.000|20110124130234.000|TR0|Whether she is cooperating, we don't know. 
20110124130234.000|20110124130237.000|TR0| What is clear is that the search for her 
20110124130237.000|20110124130239.000|TR0|picked up steam Saturday when an employee 
20110124130239.000|20110124130241.000|TR0|at a pawnshop recognized her from media 
20110124130241.000|20110124130244.000|TR0|reports.  She showed up in Bridgeport, 
20110124130244.000|20110124130246.000|TR0|Connecticut, to try to pawn some jewelry.  
20110124130246.000|20110124130248.000|TR0|She didn't like the price she was offered 
20110124130248.000|20110124130251.000|TR0|and left after just a few minutes.  Cops 
20110124130251.000|20110124130253.000|TR0|were called to the store and police told 
20110124130253.000|20110124130256.000|TR0|me how they confirmed it was really.
20110124130256.000|20110124130258.000|TR0|
20110124130258.000|20110124130300.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110124130300.000|20110124130303.000|TR0|
20110124130303.000|20110124130305.000|TR0|DET. KEITH BRYANT, BRIDGEPORT, CONNECTICUT 
20110124130305.000|20110124130307.000|TR0|POLICE DEPT.:  They were able to obtain 
20110124130307.000|20110124130310.000|TR0|some video of surveillance from the store 
20110124130310.000|20110124130312.000|TR0|and they -- based on what they observed 
20110124130312.000|20110124130314.000|TR0|and what the photographs that we had of 
20110124130314.000|20110124130317.000|TR0|her -- they confirmed the fact that it was 
20110124130317.000|20110124130319.000|TR0|her in question.
20110124130319.000|20110124130321.000|TR0|
20110124130321.000|20110124130324.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  And she came in by herself?
20110124130324.000|20110124130326.000|TR0|
20110124130326.000|20110124130328.000|TR0|BRYANT:  She came in by herself, yes.  And 
20110124130328.000|20110124130331.000|TR0|she turned around and she left, you know, 
20110124130331.000|20110124130333.000|TR0|on foot.  The clerk advised the detectives 
20110124130333.000|20110124130335.000|TR0|that he didn't observe her get into a car. 
20110124130335.000|20110124130338.000|TR0| You know, he immediately jumped on the 
20110124130338.000|20110124130340.000|TR0|telephone and called the police department 
20110124130340.000|20110124130342.000|TR0|and made him aware of his sightings.
20110124130342.000|20110124130345.000|TR0|
20110124130345.000|20110124130347.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110124130347.000|20110124130349.000|TR0|
20110124130349.000|20110124130352.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  Now, we don't know what 
20110124130352.000|20110124130354.000|TR0|happened in between, but the next day, 
20110124130354.000|20110124130357.000|TR0|Sunday, yesterday, Pettway then turned 
20110124130357.000|20110124130359.000|TR0|herself in to the FBI.
20110124130359.000|20110124130401.000|TR0|
20110124130401.000|20110124130404.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And some -- and she did actually 
20110124130404.000|20110124130406.000|TR0|this by reaching out through Facebook.  
20110124130406.000|20110124130408.000|TR0|This is bizarre as well.
20110124130408.000|20110124130411.000|TR0|
20110124130411.000|20110124130413.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  Yes.  We learned from a law 
20110124130413.000|20110124130415.000|TR0|enforcement source she reached out to 
20110124130415.000|20110124130418.000|TR0|police on the Bridgeport Facebook page and 
20110124130418.000|20110124130420.000|TR0|then turned herself into the FBI.
20110124130420.000|20110124130422.000|TR0|
20110124130422.000|20110124130425.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And any reaction just yet from 
20110124130425.000|20110124130427.000|TR0|the real family or the fake family to the 
20110124130427.000|20110124130429.000|TR0|surrender?
20110124130429.000|20110124130432.000|TR0|
20110124130432.000|20110124130434.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  Well, not yet.  Of course, 
20110124130434.000|20110124130436.000|TR0|we've been reaching out to them.  Perhaps, 
20110124130436.000|20110124130439.000|TR0|they'll be in court today.  And we can 
20110124130439.000|20110124130441.000|TR0|talk to them as well.  But we do that the 
20110124130441.000|20110124130443.000|TR0|birth mother has said that she'd really 
20110124130443.000|20110124130446.000|TR0|like to get some answers from the woman 
20110124130446.000|20110124130448.000|TR0|who is accused now of stealing her baby.
20110124130448.000|20110124130451.000|TR0|
20110124130451.000|20110124130453.000|TR0|Maybe, now, she'll get some answers.
20110124130453.000|20110124130455.000|TR0|
20110124130455.000|20110124130458.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Right.  All right.  Susan 
20110124130458.000|20110124130500.000|TR0|Candiotti, I know you've been following it 
20110124130500.000|20110124130502.000|TR0|and you'll keep us up-to-date on this.  
20110124130502.000|20110124130505.000|TR0|Thanks so much.
20110124130505.000|20110124130507.000|TR0|
20110124130507.000|20110124130509.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  You bet.
20110124130509.000|20110124130512.000|TR0|
20110124130512.000|20110124130514.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Thanks, Susan.
20110124130514.000|20110124130516.000|TR0|
20110124130516.000|20110124130519.000|TR0|Well, I'll take you to a Wal-Mart where 
20110124130519.000|20110124130521.000|TR0|two people were killed. This is just 
20110124130521.000|20110124130523.000|TR0|outside of Seattle, about 15 miles outside 
20110124130523.000|20110124130526.000|TR0|of Seattle. Two people killed after police 
20110124130526.000|20110124130528.000|TR0|were called because a man was acting 
20110124130528.000|20110124130530.000|TR0|strangely there.  They got there, tried to 
20110124130530.000|20110124130533.000|TR0|question him, he turns around and opens 
20110124130533.000|20110124130535.000|TR0|fire.  Two sheriff's deputies were injured 
20110124130535.000|20110124130537.000|TR0|here as well and another young woman was 
20110124130537.000|20110124130540.000|TR0|killed in the parking lot that police 
20110124130540.000|20110124130542.000|TR0|right now believe was tied to the suspect.
20110124130542.000|20110124130545.000|TR0|
20110124130545.000|20110124130547.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Police in Detroit say that a 
20110124130547.000|20110124130549.000|TR0|gunman walked into their precinct and 
20110124130549.000|20110124130552.000|TR0|started shooting.  In all, four officers 
20110124130552.000|20110124130554.000|TR0|were hit. Everyone is expected to survive. 
20110124130554.000|20110124130556.000|TR0| The suspect, though, was eventually shot

20110124130559.000|20110124130601.000|TR0|the chest.  She was saved, though, from 
20110124130601.000|20110124130603.000|TR0|injury by a bullet proof vest.  The city's 
20110124130603.000|20110124130606.000|TR0|police chief says it's time to start 
20110124130606.000|20110124130608.000|TR0|reevaluating security for Detroit police.

20110124130622.000|20110124130624.000|TR0|Giffords and with this incident, of 
20110124130624.000|20110124130627.000|TR0|course, we have to take a step back and 
20110124130627.000|20110124130629.000|TR0|reassess security procedure at each one of 
20110124130629.000|20110124130631.000|TR0|our facilities.  We want to still maintain 
20110124130631.000|20110124130634.000|TR0|a community policing format.  We want to 
20110124130634.000|20110124130636.000|TR0|engage our public.  But by the same token, 
20110124130636.000|20110124130639.000|TR0|incidents like this are very sobering.

20110124130648.000|20110124130650.000|TR0|commander shot in the back. He had surgery 
20110124130650.000|20110124130653.000|TR0|and his prognosis at this point is good.
20110124130653.000|20110124130655.000|TR0|
20110124130655.000|20110124130657.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, the famed fitness guru Jack 
20110124130657.000|20110124130700.000|TR0|Lalanne is dead at the age of 96, died of 
20110124130700.000|20110124130702.000|TR0|respiratory failure due to pneumonia. 
20110124130702.000|20110124130704.000|TR0|According to his agent, this is a man who 
20110124130704.000|20110124130707.000|TR0|many of you will know from so many stunts 
20110124130707.000|20110124130709.000|TR0|he pulled, if you will, throughout his 
20110124130709.000|20110124130711.000|TR0|life.  Even in his later years, at one 
20110124130711.000|20110124130714.000|TR0|point doing 1,000 push-ups in 20 minutes.  
20110124130714.000|20110124130716.000|TR0|He even slammed the link of the Golden 
20110124130716.000|20110124130718.000|TR0|Gate Bridge at point and he did all of 
20110124130718.000|20110124130721.000|TR0|these stunts even to his later years.
20110124130721.000|20110124130723.000|TR0|
20110124130723.000|20110124130725.000|TR0|He was the founder of the modern fitness 
20110124130725.000|20110124130728.000|TR0|movement, and was talking about getting 
20110124130728.000|20110124130730.000|TR0|America moving and eating right before 
20110124130730.000|20110124130732.000|TR0|everybody got into working out and eating 
20110124130732.000|20110124130735.000|TR0|right.  But, Jack Lalanne, 96 years old.
20110124130735.000|20110124130737.000|TR0|
20110124130737.000|20110124130740.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.  They start -- they say that 
20110124130740.000|20110124130742.000|TR0|he started the fitness craze when doctors 
20110124130742.000|20110124130744.000|TR0|were telling people not lifting weights 
20110124130744.000|20110124130747.000|TR0|was actually bad for your heart.  I mean, 
20110124130747.000|20110124130749.000|TR0|that's how much things have changed.
20110124130749.000|20110124130751.000|TR0|
20110124130751.000|20110124130754.000|TR0|HOLMES:  But he was the one that started 
20110124130754.000|20110124130756.000|TR0|it all.  He was in great shape even into 
20110124130756.000|20110124130758.000|TR0|his 90s.
20110124130758.000|20110124130801.000|TR0|
20110124130801.000|20110124130803.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.  He said the worse thing you 
20110124130803.000|20110124130805.000|TR0|can for your body is to not use it.  And 
20110124130805.000|20110124130808.000|TR0|he lived that everyday.
20110124130808.000|20110124130810.000|TR0|
20110124130810.000|20110124130812.000|TR0|Well, meantime, 94-year-old Zsa Zsa Gabor 
20110124130812.000|20110124130815.000|TR0|is back home this morning, a week after 
20110124130815.000|20110124130817.000|TR0|having her right leg amputated.  Her 
20110124130817.000|20110124130819.000|TR0|husband has putting their 28-room Bel Air 
20110124130819.000|20110124130822.000|TR0|mansion up for sale to help pay Zsa Zsa's 
20110124130822.000|20110124130824.000|TR0|medical bills.  The home once belonged to 
20110124130824.000|20110124130826.000|TR0|Elvis Presley.
20110124130826.000|20110124130829.000|TR0|
20110124130829.000|20110124130831.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And the State of the Union 
20110124130831.000|20110124130834.000|TR0|address tomorrow is going to kind of 
20110124130834.000|20110124130836.000|TR0|resemble maybe a middle school assembly.  
20110124130836.000|20110124130838.000|TR0|Everybody is trying to figure out who are 
20110124130838.000|20110124130841.000|TR0|the cool kids you need to sit next to. But 
20110124130841.000|20110124130843.000|TR0|some call this really a matter of the odd 
20110124130843.000|20110124130845.000|TR0|couple meeting, the dating game.
20110124130845.000|20110124130848.000|TR0|
20110124130848.000|20110124130850.000|TR0|We got at least 50 members of the House 
20110124130850.000|20110124130852.000|TR0|and Senate now onboard with this idea of 
20110124130852.000|20110124130855.000|TR0|trying to promote more civility by doing a 
20110124130855.000|20110124130857.000|TR0|simple bipartisan gesture of Democrats and 
20110124130857.000|20110124130859.000|TR0|Republicans sitting together. You're just 
20110124130859.000|20110124130902.000|TR0|seeing a few of the faces there who have 
20110124130902.000|20110124130904.000|TR0|decided that they've got a date for 
20110124130904.000|20110124130906.000|TR0|tomorrow night.
20110124130906.000|20110124130909.000|TR0|
20110124130909.000|20110124130911.000|TR0|How about Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin 
20110124130911.000|20110124130913.000|TR0|and Illinois Republican Mark Kirk?  Don't 
20110124130913.000|20110124130916.000|TR0|they make a cute couple?

20110124130928.000|20110124130930.000|TR0|Mark Kirk, and I are going to sit 
20110124130930.000|20110124130932.000|TR0|together. I'm bringing the popcorn.  He's 
20110124130932.000|20110124130935.000|TR0|bringing a coke with two straws.  We are

20110124130953.000|20110124130956.000|TR0|on the latest CNN/Opinion Research Poll do

20110124131005.000|20110124131007.000|TR0|and good, but actually, work together to

20110124131017.000|20110124131019.000|TR0|They have a date in the big "D," Detroit

20110124131045.000|20110124131047.000|TR0|Well, the Packers punch their Super Bowl

20110124131050.000|20110124131052.000|TR0|Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship.  
20110124131052.000|20110124131054.000|TR0|And as for the Steelers, the Jets didn't 
20110124131054.000|20110124131057.000|TR0|look like they showed up for the first 
20110124131057.000|20110124131059.000|TR0|half of the game.  They build a big lead 
20110124131059.000|20110124131101.000|TR0|and even though the Jets had a big 
20110124131101.000|20110124131104.000|TR0|comeback in the second half, it was not 
20110124131104.000|20110124131106.000|TR0|enough.  And the Steelers held on 24-19 
20110124131106.000|20110124131108.000|TR0|for the victory and for the AFC title.
20110124131108.000|20110124131111.000|TR0|
20110124131111.000|20110124131113.000|TR0|I'm checking the calendar, just making

20110124131118.000|20110124131120.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Just making sure we got the date 
20110124131120.000|20110124131123.000|TR0|right.  Nobody is going to miss, though.
20110124131123.000|20110124131125.000|TR0|
20110124131125.000|20110124131127.000|TR0|We'll get back to the Bears here now.  
20110124131127.000|20110124131130.000|TR0|Maybe they would have a better chance if 
20110124131130.000|20110124131132.000|TR0|their star quarterback was in the game.  
20110124131132.000|20110124131134.000|TR0|That's Jay Cutler there limping off.  He 
20110124131134.000|20110124131137.000|TR0|didn't play most of the third quarter. He 
20110124131137.000|20110124131139.000|TR0|didn't play the fourth quarter at all 
20110124131139.000|20110124131141.000|TR0|because of a knee injury.
20110124131141.000|20110124131144.000|TR0|
20110124131144.000|20110124131146.000|TR0|But, now, a lot of people, and as of those 
20110124131146.000|20110124131148.000|TR0|people, I mean, some out in the media, but 
20110124131148.000|20110124131151.000|TR0|also some players, NFL players, are 
20110124131151.000|20110124131153.000|TR0|questioning his toughness.  They said, 
20110124131153.000|20110124131155.000|TR0|hey, this is a shot at the Super Bowl on 
20110124131155.000|20110124131158.000|TR0|the line and you're not even getting in 
20110124131158.000|20110124131200.000|TR0|the game.

20110124131202.000|20110124131205.000|TR0|Well, one of those criticizing was Jaguars 
20110124131205.000|20110124131207.000|TR0|running back Maurice Jones-Drew, said, 
20110124131207.000|20110124131209.000|TR0|quote, "When the going gets tough, quit.  
20110124131209.000|20110124131212.000|TR0|All I'm saying is that he can finish the 
20110124131212.000|20110124131214.000|TR0|game on a hurt knee.  I played the whole 
20110124131214.000|20110124131217.000|TR0|season on one."
20110124131217.000|20110124131219.000|TR0|
20110124131219.000|20110124131221.000|TR0|Here's another tweet for you coming to us 
20110124131221.000|20110124131224.000|TR0|from the Cardinals' defense end, Darnell 
20110124131224.000|20110124131226.000|TR0|Dockett saying, "If I'm on Chicago's team, 
20110124131226.000|20110124131228.000|TR0|Jay Cutler has to wait until me and the 
20110124131228.000|20110124131231.000|TR0|team is out of the shower, get dressed and 
20110124131231.000|20110124131233.000|TR0|leave before he comes in the locker room."
20110124131233.000|20110124131235.000|TR0|
20110124131235.000|20110124131238.000|TR0|Again, these are attacks people 
20110124131238.000|20110124131240.000|TR0|questioning his toughness.  But what do 
20110124131240.000|20110124131242.000|TR0|you do?  Nobody knows what's going on with 
20110124131242.000|20110124131245.000|TR0|that man's body, but him and certainly, I 
20110124131245.000|20110124131247.000|TR0|don't know if it's right to question his 
20110124131247.000|20110124131249.000|TR0|heart in that big game.
20110124131249.000|20110124131252.000|TR0|
20110124131252.000|20110124131254.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.  I mean, I'm sure they're 
20110124131254.000|20110124131256.000|TR0|already just very depressed because of the 
20110124131256.000|20110124131259.000|TR0|loss and because of the fans saying, quite 
20110124131259.000|20110124131301.000|TR0|unhappy, though.
20110124131301.000|20110124131303.000|TR0|
20110124131303.000|20110124131306.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Yes.
20110124131306.000|20110124131308.000|TR0|
20110124131308.000|20110124131311.000|TR0|CHETRY:  So, poor guy.
20110124131311.000|20110124131313.000|TR0|
20110124131313.000|20110124131315.000|TR0|All right.  Well, the camera never blinks, 
20110124131315.000|20110124131318.000|TR0|what about Jets quarterback, Mark Sanchez? 
20110124131318.000|20110124131320.000|TR0| What a yucky was he doing?  There you see 
20110124131320.000|20110124131322.000|TR0|it.  It looks like picked his nose and 
20110124131322.000|20110124131325.000|TR0|then proceeded to use his teammate as a 
20110124131325.000|20110124131327.000|TR0|Kleenex.  Yes, that was backup quarterback 
20110124131327.000|20110124131329.000|TR0|Mark Brunell's jacket.  Brunell knew what 
20110124131329.000|20110124131332.000|TR0|hit him.
20110124131332.000|20110124131334.000|TR0|
20110124131334.000|20110124131336.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Backup quarterback is kind of a 
20110124131336.000|20110124131339.000|TR0|junk job sometimes.
20110124131339.000|20110124131341.000|TR0|
20110124131341.000|20110124131343.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Come on.
20110124131343.000|20110124131346.000|TR0|
20110124131346.000|20110124131348.000|TR0|HOLMES:  It is.
20110124131348.000|20110124131350.000|TR0|
20110124131350.000|20110124131353.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110124131353.000|20110124131355.000|TR0|
20110124131355.000|20110124131357.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Hey, it comes with the job 
20110124131357.000|20110124131400.000|TR0|sometimes.  Be a star and you won't get 
20110124131400.000|20110124131402.000|TR0|that.
20110124131402.000|20110124131404.000|TR0|
20110124131404.000|20110124131407.000|TR0|Let's turn now, a lot of things we're 
20110124131407.000|20110124131409.000|TR0|seeing out of D.C. this morning.  It's 
20110124131409.000|20110124131412.000|TR0|going to cause a problem.  A live picture 
20110124131412.000|20110124131414.000|TR0|out a water main break.  Do we still have 
20110124131414.000|20110124131416.000|TR0|that picture up?  I do believe, and there 
20110124131416.000|20110124131419.000|TR0|it is.
20110124131419.000|20110124131421.000|TR0|
20110124131421.000|20110124131423.000|TR0|This might not look so bad.  Two vehicles 
20110124131423.000|20110124131426.000|TR0|involved there in this car accident, we 
20110124131426.000|20110124131428.000|TR0|understand.  I believe there was an 
20110124131428.000|20110124131430.000|TR0|injury, I believe, involved.
20110124131430.000|20110124131433.000|TR0|
20110124131433.000|20110124131435.000|TR0|But this is actually shutting down the 
20110124131435.000|20110124131437.000|TR0|inner loop.  This is in Maryland in 
20110124131437.000|20110124131440.000|TR0|particular.  But the loop is a big deal on 
20110124131440.000|20110124131442.000|TR0|a rush hour. But this -- what looks like a 
20110124131442.000|20110124131444.000|TR0|minor deal is going to turn out to be a 
20110124131444.000|20110124131447.000|TR0|big deal for a lot of people trying to get 
20110124131447.000|20110124131449.000|TR0|to work.
20110124131449.000|20110124131451.000|TR0|
20110124131451.000|20110124131454.000|TR0|CHETRY:  They say the water is actually 
20110124131454.000|20110124131456.000|TR0|freezing on the highway because it's so 
20110124131456.000|20110124131458.000|TR0|cold there as well, that it's actually 
20110124131458.000|20110124131501.000|TR0|running on to the Beltway and freezing 
20110124131501.000|20110124131503.000|TR0|there.  This is in Prince George's County. 
20110124131503.000|20110124131506.000|TR0|So, I guess you are happy at a couple of 
20110124131506.000|20110124131508.000|TR0|the high schools in the area. They're on 
20110124131508.000|20110124131510.000|TR0|two-hour delay because of the water main 
20110124131510.000|20110124131513.000|TR0|break.
20110124131513.000|20110124131515.000|TR0|
20110124131515.000|20110124131517.000|TR0|HOLMES:  But again --
20110124131517.000|20110124131520.000|TR0|
20110124131520.000|20110124131522.000|TR0|CHETRY:  On top of snow days and 
20110124131522.000|20110124131524.000|TR0|everything else.
20110124131524.000|20110124131527.000|TR0|
20110124131527.000|20110124131529.000|TR0|HOLMES:  They got to make them up 
20110124131529.000|20110124131531.000|TR0|somewhere.
20110124131531.000|20110124131534.000|TR0|
20110124131534.000|20110124131536.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.
20110124131536.000|20110124131538.000|TR0|
20110124131538.000|20110124131541.000|TR0|HOLMES:  We'll see.
20110124131541.000|20110124131543.000|TR0|
20110124131543.000|20110124131545.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Amazing video to show you out of 
20110124131545.000|20110124131548.000|TR0|Ontario.  A car with a dash-cam captured 
20110124131548.000|20110124131550.000|TR0|this shot.  A tractor trailer, check out 
20110124131550.000|20110124131552.000|TR0|the left side of the screen, crashing 
20110124131552.000|20110124131555.000|TR0|through the guard rail, losing control, 
20110124131555.000|20110124131557.000|TR0|dumping 30 tons of sand.  Happened on a 
20110124131557.000|20110124131600.000|TR0|Friday morning.
20110124131600.000|20110124131602.000|TR0|
20110124131602.000|20110124131604.000|TR0|Several other vehicles were involved.  No 
20110124131604.000|20110124131607.000|TR0|one was hurt, though. The truck driver, 
20110124131607.000|20110124131609.000|TR0|though, is blaming the accident on poor 
20110124131609.000|20110124131611.000|TR0|driving. There you see him just barely 
20110124131611.000|20110124131614.000|TR0|missing another big rig as he slams 
20110124131614.000|20110124131616.000|TR0|through that guard rail.  He's actually 
20110124131616.000|20110124131618.000|TR0|been charged with reckless driving.
20110124131618.000|20110124131621.000|TR0|
20110124131621.000|20110124131623.000|TR0|Let's check in with Rob Marciano.  He's 
20110124131623.000|20110124131625.000|TR0|keeping an eye on the weather for us.  And 
20110124131625.000|20110124131628.000|TR0|we're expecting some more stormy weather 
20110124131628.000|20110124131630.000|TR0|is making its way South and then up the 
20110124131630.000|20110124131632.000|TR0|East Coast.
20110124131632.000|20110124131635.000|TR0|
20110124131635.000|20110124131637.000|TR0|Hey, Rob.
20110124131637.000|20110124131639.000|TR0|
20110124131639.000|20110124131642.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Good 
20110124131642.000|20110124131644.000|TR0|morning, guys.
20110124131644.000|20110124131646.000|TR0|
20110124131646.000|20110124131649.000|TR0|Sub-freezing temperatures are the big 
20110124131649.000|20110124131651.000|TR0|story, along with the Beltway water main 
20110124131651.000|20110124131653.000|TR0|issue.  Nineteen degrees in D.C. right 
20110124131653.000|20110124131656.000|TR0|now.  So, that's enough to freeze water on 
20110124131656.000|20110124131658.000|TR0|road in a hurry.  So, issues there. And 
20110124131658.000|20110124131701.000|TR0|then temperatures really drop off the 
20110124131701.000|20110124131703.000|TR0|table as you go a little bit further to 
20110124131703.000|20110124131705.000|TR0|the north.
20110124131705.000|20110124131708.000|TR0|
20110124131708.000|20110124131710.000|TR0|Thirteen below right now in Syracuse, New 
20110124131710.000|20110124131712.000|TR0|York.  It's minus two in Boston.  But you 
20110124131712.000|20110124131715.000|TR0|factor in the wind and the wind chills are 
20110124131715.000|20110124131717.000|TR0|frightening.  Minus 27 in Syracuse.  It's 
20110124131717.000|20110124131719.000|TR0|21 degrees below in Albany and Boston.  
20110124131719.000|20110124131722.000|TR0|And eight degrees below zero is what it 
20110124131722.000|20110124131724.000|TR0|feels like now with the wind in New York 
20110124131724.000|20110124131726.000|TR0|City.  So, you know, cover up the skin as 
20110124131726.000|20110124131729.000|TR0|you head out the door today.  It's 
20110124131729.000|20110124131731.000|TR0|certainly dangerously cold in those spots.
20110124131731.000|20110124131733.000|TR0|
20110124131733.000|20110124131736.000|TR0|A little bit of moisture heading into that 
20110124131736.000|20110124131738.000|TR0|cold, but very dry air.  And this is not 
20110124131738.000|20110124131740.000|TR0|really going to amount a whole lot.  So, 
20110124131740.000|20110124131743.000|TR0|I'm not too much worried about that.  What 
20110124131743.000|20110124131745.000|TR0|I'm more concerned is what's developing 
20110124131745.000|20110124131747.000|TR0|across parts of the South.  And heavy rain 
20110124131747.000|20110124131750.000|TR0|will be falling across the upper Texas 
20110124131750.000|20110124131752.000|TR0|coastline into southwest Louisiana today, 
20110124131752.000|20110124131755.000|TR0|and this will be developing into a major 
20110124131755.000|20110124131757.000|TR0|rain and then snowstorm for parts of the 
20110124131757.000|20110124131759.000|TR0|Southeast and eventually the Northeast as 
20110124131759.000|20110124131802.000|TR0|well.
20110124131802.000|20110124131804.000|TR0|
20110124131804.000|20110124131806.000|TR0|Another shot, believe it or not, of cold

20110124131809.000|20110124131811.000|TR0|warm-up yesterday and today across the

20110124131816.000|20110124131818.000|TR0|We'll talk more about -- we'll try to give 
20110124131818.000|20110124131820.000|TR0|you some details of what this thing is 
20110124131820.000|20110124131823.000|TR0|going to do across the Northeast -- rain, 
20110124131823.000|20110124131825.000|TR0|sleet, or snow, maybe all of them come 
20110124131825.000|20110124131827.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) Thursday.

20110124131832.000|20110124131834.000|TR0|Thanks, Rob.

20110124131841.000|20110124131844.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, he is a high-profile 
20110124131844.000|20110124131846.000|TR0|Republican who supported Senator Obama in 
20110124131846.000|20110124131849.000|TR0|the last presidential election.  But this 
20110124131849.000|20110124131851.000|TR0|time around, he's not so sure if he's 
20110124131851.000|20110124131853.000|TR0|going to support him again.

20110124131905.000|20110124131907.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Fourteen minutes past the hour on 
20110124131907.000|20110124131910.000|TR0|this AMERICAN MORNING.
20110124131910.000|20110124131912.000|TR0|
20110124131912.000|20110124131914.000|TR0|As you know, the president has got a big 
20110124131914.000|20110124131917.000|TR0|day tomorrow night. The State of the Union 
20110124131917.000|20110124131919.000|TR0|is coming up.  This is his second since 
20110124131919.000|20110124131921.000|TR0|taking office.
20110124131921.000|20110124131924.000|TR0|
20110124131924.000|20110124131926.000|TR0|And we are getting an idea of what he's 
20110124131926.000|20110124131928.000|TR0|going to be talking about.  You could 
20110124131928.000|20110124131931.000|TR0|probably guess anyway.  But his focus is 
20110124131931.000|20110124131933.000|TR0|going pretty to be all about jobs and the 
20110124131933.000|20110124131935.000|TR0|economy, and dedicating his next two years 
20110124131935.000|20110124131938.000|TR0|in office to getting this country back to 
20110124131938.000|20110124131940.000|TR0|work again.  You can also expect him to 
20110124131940.000|20110124131943.000|TR0|focus on unity and civility as well.
20110124131943.000|20110124131945.000|TR0|
20110124131945.000|20110124131947.000|TR0|Again, it's 9:00 Eastern Time.  Of course, 
20110124131947.000|20110124131950.000|TR0|you can catch it right here on CNN.
20110124131950.000|20110124131952.000|TR0|
20110124131952.000|20110124131954.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, among those who will be 
20110124131954.000|20110124131957.000|TR0|watching the president's speech closely is 
20110124131957.000|20110124131959.000|TR0|retired general and former secretary of 
20110124131959.000|20110124132001.000|TR0|state, Colin Powell.  He was a major Obama 
20110124132001.000|20110124132004.000|TR0|supporter in 2008, crossing party lines. 
20110124132004.000|20110124132006.000|TR0|But Powell tells CNN that he's not ready 
20110124132006.000|20110124132008.000|TR0|to back the president or anyone else for 
20110124132008.000|20110124132011.000|TR0|that matter in 2012.

20110124132020.000|20110124132022.000|TR0|STATE:  I will always vote as I have 
20110124132022.000|20110124132025.000|TR0|throughout my life for the person I think 
20110124132025.000|20110124132027.000|TR0|is best qualified to be president of the 
20110124132027.000|20110124132029.000|TR0|United States.  And I don't adhere to a 
20110124132029.000|20110124132032.000|TR0|single party line.  So, I'm not committed 
20110124132032.000|20110124132034.000|TR0|to Barack Obama.  I'm not committed to a 
20110124132034.000|20110124132036.000|TR0|Republican candidate.  I will see who 
20110124132036.000|20110124132039.000|TR0|emerges.  Right now, I do not see on the 
20110124132039.000|20110124132041.000|TR0|Republican side any one individual who I 
20110124132041.000|20110124132044.000|TR0|think is going to emerge at the top of the 
20110124132044.000|20110124132046.000|TR0|pile.
20110124132046.000|20110124132048.000|TR0|
20110124132048.000|20110124132051.000|TR0|So, it is going to be an interesting 2011 
20110124132051.000|20110124132053.000|TR0|and very interesting early 2012 as the 
20110124132053.000|20110124132055.000|TR0|primaries begin and they separate 
20110124132055.000|20110124132058.000|TR0|themselves.  But I am not committed to any 
20110124132058.000|20110124132100.000|TR0|candidate until I see all the candidates 
20110124132100.000|20110124132102.000|TR0|and finally see who the two candidates are 
20110124132102.000|20110124132105.000|TR0|who are going for this position.

20110124132112.000|20110124132114.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Powell says the president has 
20110124132114.000|20110124132116.000|TR0|addressed some campaign promises but that 
20110124132116.000|20110124132119.000|TR0|he still has a way to go.
20110124132119.000|20110124132121.000|TR0|
20110124132121.000|20110124132123.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Will the person going head to 
20110124132123.000|20110124132126.000|TR0|head with President Obama in the election 
20110124132126.000|20110124132128.000|TR0|be Mitt Romney?  Well, if you believe this 
20110124132128.000|20110124132130.000|TR0|latest poll out of New Hampshire, he would 
20110124132130.000|20110124132133.000|TR0|be.  Former Massachusetts governor won the 
20110124132133.000|20110124132135.000|TR0|New Hampshire Republican Party straw poll. 
20110124132135.000|20110124132138.000|TR0| He came in at 35 percent.  Behind him, 
20110124132138.000|20110124132140.000|TR0|Congressman Ron Paul, then Minnesota 
20110124132140.000|20110124132142.000|TR0|governor, Tim Pawlenty at 8 percent, Sarah 
20110124132142.000|20110124132145.000|TR0|Palin at 7 percent, and then, Minnesota 
20110124132145.000|20110124132147.000|TR0|congresswoman Michele Bachmann who's 
20110124132147.000|20110124132149.000|TR0|starting to make some noise and get some 
20110124132149.000|20110124132152.000|TR0|attention at 5 percent.
20110124132152.000|20110124132154.000|TR0|
20110124132154.000|20110124132156.000|TR0|CHETRY:  And what about former New York 
20110124132156.000|20110124132159.000|TR0|City mayor, Rudy Giuliani, 2008 
20110124132159.000|20110124132201.000|TR0|presidential candidate as well.  He talked 
20110124132201.000|20110124132203.000|TR0|about his presidential ambitions.  His 
20110124132203.000|20110124132206.000|TR0|interview will see only on "Piers Morgan 
20110124132206.000|20110124132208.000|TR0|Tonight."  Giuliani says that he's more 
20110124132208.000|20110124132210.000|TR0|likely to run in 2012 if Sarah Palin makes 
20110124132210.000|20110124132213.000|TR0|a bid.

20110124132220.000|20110124132222.000|TR0|PIERS MORGAN, CNN HOST:  Would you be more 
20110124132222.000|20110124132224.000|TR0|tempted to run if she wasn't?
20110124132224.000|20110124132227.000|TR0|
20110124132227.000|20110124132229.000|TR0|RUDY GIULIANI, (R) FMR. NEW YORK MAYOR:  
20110124132229.000|20110124132232.000|TR0|maybe the opposite.
20110124132232.000|20110124132234.000|TR0|
20110124132234.000|20110124132236.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Really?

20110124132239.000|20110124132241.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Yes.  Maybe the opposite 
20110124132241.000|20110124132243.000|TR0|because, you know, my one chance if I have 
20110124132243.000|20110124132246.000|TR0|a chance is that I'm considered a moderate 
20110124132246.000|20110124132248.000|TR0|Republican.
20110124132248.000|20110124132250.000|TR0|

20110124132255.000|20110124132257.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  So, the more Republicans in 
20110124132257.000|20110124132300.000|TR0|which I can show a contrast, probably, the 
20110124132300.000|20110124132302.000|TR0|better chance I have.

20110124132311.000|20110124132314.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I don't know if I'm acceptable, 
20110124132314.000|20110124132316.000|TR0|but the question is way I got elected the 
20110124132316.000|20110124132318.000|TR0|mayor of New York City was not being 
20110124132318.000|20110124132321.000|TR0|acceptable. It might my slogan was, you 
20110124132321.000|20110124132323.000|TR0|can't do any worse.

20110124132417.000|20110124132419.000|TR0|critics say is basically child porn.

20110124132427.000|20110124132429.000|TR0|outcast, but can Fergie now check her mail 
20110124132429.000|20110124132431.000|TR0|to see if an invitation to the royal 
20110124132431.000|20110124132434.000|TR0|wedding is going to arrive?  It's 18

20110124132445.000|20110124132448.000|TR0|right now.  "Morning Talker" time.  She 
20110124132448.000|20110124132450.000|TR0|has been persona non grata, I guess, since 
20110124132450.000|20110124132452.000|TR0|divorcing her prince in 1996.  So, they 
20110124132452.000|20110124132455.000|TR0|still live together.  It's an interesting 
20110124132455.000|20110124132457.000|TR0|little dynamic there.  But Sarah Ferguson,

20110124132504.000|20110124132506.000|TR0|insisted that Fergy be invited.  She'll 
20110124132506.000|20110124132509.000|TR0|accompany her two princess daughters, 
20110124132509.000|20110124132511.000|TR0|Beatrice and Eugenie, to the April 29th 
20110124132511.000|20110124132513.000|TR0|wedding.  Fergie won't be welcomed,

20110124132525.000|20110124132528.000|TR0|William, though.
20110124132528.000|20110124132530.000|TR0|
20110124132530.000|20110124132532.000|TR0|CHETRY:  It's interesting that his dad is 
20110124132532.000|20110124132535.000|TR0|not going to invite her to the after party.
20110124132535.000|20110124132537.000|TR0|
20110124132537.000|20110124132539.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, she gets go to the wedding. 
20110124132539.000|20110124132542.000|TR0| That's a big deal for her because she

20110124132549.000|20110124132551.000|TR0|Also, Donald Trump is going to be a 
20110124132551.000|20110124132553.000|TR0|granddad for the third time I believe it 
20110124132553.000|20110124132556.000|TR0|is, but his daughter, Ivanka Trump, she 
20110124132556.000|20110124132558.000|TR0|has announced she is pregnant expecting 
20110124132558.000|20110124132600.000|TR0|her first with her husband, Jared Kushner. 
20110124132600.000|20110124132603.000|TR0|Again, Donald, this will be his third 
20110124132603.000|20110124132605.000|TR0|grandchild.  Congratulations to that.

20110124132607.000|20110124132610.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Well, Wrigley is the third major 
20110124132610.000|20110124132612.000|TR0|sponsor jumping ship now on "Skins," the 
20110124132612.000|20110124132615.000|TR0|controversial MTV show.  First told you 
20110124132615.000|20110124132617.000|TR0|about this last week.  Well, the Parents 
20110124132617.000|20110124132619.000|TR0|Television Council wants the government to 
20110124132619.000|20110124132622.000|TR0|investigate the show for exploitation and 
20110124132622.000|20110124132624.000|TR0|child porn.  Wrigley's says that they're 
20110124132624.000|20110124132626.000|TR0|suspending advertising because "Skins," 
20110124132626.000|20110124132629.000|TR0|quote, "It was never our intent to endorse 
20110124132629.000|20110124132631.000|TR0|content that could offend consumers." Taco 
20110124132631.000|20110124132633.000|TR0|Bell also pulled its ad last week, and GM 
20110124132633.000|20110124132636.000|TR0|puts "Skins" on its do- not-buy list.      
20110124132636.000|20110124132638.000|TR0|HOLMES:  There is a thing out there that 
20110124132638.000|20110124132640.000|TR0|says you don't bring a knife to a gun 
20110124132640.000|20110124132643.000|TR0|fight.  But in this case, don't bring a 
20110124132643.000|20110124132645.000|TR0|knife to a hammer fight.  This happened 
20110124132645.000|20110124132647.000|TR0|with a clerk at a convenience store, 
20110124132647.000|20110124132650.000|TR0|listen to him describe what happened when 
20110124132650.000|20110124132652.000|TR0|somebody tried to rob him with a knife.

20110124132704.000|20110124132706.000|TR0|money out of the cash register.  And I 
20110124132706.000|20110124132708.000|TR0|said what did you say?  He repeated it.  
20110124132708.000|20110124132711.000|TR0|The third time he repeated it, I hit him 
20110124132711.000|20110124132713.000|TR0|in the head with a hammer.  I expected him 
20110124132713.000|20110124132716.000|TR0|to drop, but he didn't.  He must have head 
20110124132716.000|20110124132718.000|TR0|-- I hope he's got a headache.

20110124132725.000|20110124132727.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Now, the suspect is still out 
20110124132727.000|20110124132730.000|TR0|there on the loose when all you have to 
20110124132730.000|20110124132732.000|TR0|do, I would assume, is find the guy with 
20110124132732.000|20110124132734.000|TR0|the big bruise on his head.  Now, 
20110124132734.000|20110124132737.000|TR0|according to the clerk here, he said he 
20110124132737.000|20110124132739.000|TR0|did not hit him with the head of the 
20110124132739.000|20110124132741.000|TR0|hammer.  You see how he's holding it 
20110124132741.000|20110124132744.000|TR0|there.  He hit him with the handle of the 
20110124132744.000|20110124132746.000|TR0|hammer.
20110124132746.000|20110124132748.000|TR0|
20110124132748.000|20110124132751.000|TR0|CHETRY:  See, that's he -- would have 
20110124132751.000|20110124132753.000|TR0|caught him if hit him with the other end.
20110124132753.000|20110124132755.000|TR0|
20110124132755.000|20110124132758.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Yes.  That's a different story.

20110124132817.000|20110124132819.000|TR0|They're not the only one on there.  Yes, 
20110124132819.000|20110124132821.000|TR0|they have their dog strapped to the bottom 
20110124132821.000|20110124132824.000|TR0|of their tandem paraglide equipment there.

20110124132828.000|20110124132831.000|TR0|everyday and wanted to include the dog so 
20110124132831.000|20110124132833.000|TR0|they had a special harness made just for 
20110124132833.000|20110124132835.000|TR0|the dog.  Now, the dog doesn't look too 
20110124132835.000|20110124132838.000|TR0|thrilled there, but there are some video 
20110124132838.000|20110124132840.000|TR0|when he's back on solid ground.  His tail 
20110124132840.000|20110124132842.000|TR0|is wagging like crazy.
20110124132842.000|20110124132845.000|TR0|

20110124132922.000|20110124132925.000|TR0|looking at video from Fairport Harbor in 
20110124132925.000|20110124132927.000|TR0|Ohio.  This is about 30 miles outside of 
20110124132927.000|20110124132929.000|TR0|Cleveland where right now they have told 
20110124132929.000|20110124132932.000|TR0|this entire village of Fairport Harbor to 
20110124132932.000|20110124132934.000|TR0|evacuate because of, perhaps, a gas 
20110124132934.000|20110124132936.000|TR0|explosion of some sort.  They say there've 
20110124132936.000|20110124132939.000|TR0|been multiple structure fires and a severe 
20110124132939.000|20110124132941.000|TR0|smell of gas in the area, and they are 
20110124132941.000|20110124132943.000|TR0|trying to get people out.
20110124132943.000|20110124132946.000|TR0|
20110124132946.000|20110124132948.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And again, this is suddenly odd.  
20110124132948.000|20110124132950.000|TR0|They confirmed at least five different 
20110124132950.000|20110124132953.000|TR0|homes there are on fire and no one has a 
20110124132953.000|20110124132955.000|TR0|good idea of why if more can add up on 
20110124132955.000|20110124132957.000|TR0|fire, but if they have to evacuate the 
20110124132957.000|20110124133000.000|TR0|area, we're talking about 3,000 people who 
20110124133000.000|20110124133002.000|TR0|might have to leave the area.  We do not 
20110124133002.000|20110124133005.000|TR0|have word of injuries, necessarily.  But 
20110124133005.000|20110124133007.000|TR0|we're also told that all 17 fire 
20110124133007.000|20110124133009.000|TR0|departments in this particular county have 
20110124133009.000|20110124133012.000|TR0|been called out and are on the scene now 
20110124133012.000|20110124133014.000|TR0|to try to deal with whatever they're 
20110124133014.000|20110124133016.000|TR0|dealing with, and they're not quite sure 
20110124133016.000|20110124133019.000|TR0|yet.
20110124133019.000|20110124133021.000|TR0|
20110124133021.000|20110124133023.000|TR0|They have a suspected gas leak, but 
20110124133023.000|20110124133026.000|TR0|something is causing this. And you 
20110124133026.000|20110124133028.000|TR0|certainly talking about a very dangerous 
20110124133028.000|20110124133030.000|TR0|situation.  The one we saw in California 
20110124133030.000|20110124133033.000|TR0|several months ago where essentially a 
20110124133033.000|20110124133035.000|TR0|whole neighborhood was leveled because of 
20110124133035.000|20110124133037.000|TR0|a gas leak and explosion there, but now, 
20110124133037.000|20110124133040.000|TR0|we're talking about what sounds like, 
20110124133040.000|20110124133042.000|TR0|again, we don't know for sure, but this is 
20110124133042.000|20110124133044.000|TR0|the only suspected thing.  It's possibly a 
20110124133044.000|20110124133047.000|TR0|gas leak, but at least five homes on fire 
20110124133047.000|20110124133049.000|TR0|in the area.  Something is going on there.
20110124133049.000|20110124133051.000|TR0|
20110124133051.000|20110124133054.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Yes.  And apparently, they're 
20110124133054.000|20110124133056.000|TR0|trying to evacuate a senior center as 
20110124133056.000|20110124133059.000|TR0|well.  The temperatures are quite cold in 
20110124133059.000|20110124133101.000|TR0|the single digits, in some cases, and 
20110124133101.000|20110124133103.000|TR0|maybe in the low teens there, but we'll 
20110124133103.000|20110124133106.000|TR0|keep our eye out for what's going on in 
20110124133106.000|20110124133108.000|TR0|Fairport Harbor outside of Cleveland this 
20110124133108.000|20110124133110.000|TR0|morning.

20110124133113.000|20110124133115.000|TR0|Meantime, Christine Romans is here of 
20110124133115.000|20110124133117.000|TR0|"Minding Your Business." Another Monday, 
20110124133117.000|20110124133120.000|TR0|another week, another airline fee.  What 
20110124133120.000|20110124133122.000|TR0|is it at this time?
20110124133122.000|20110124133124.000|TR0|
20110124133124.000|20110124133127.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS 
20110124133127.000|20110124133129.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hold on to your wallet 
20110124133129.000|20110124133131.000|TR0|when you hold on to your baby on the 
20110124133131.000|20110124133134.000|TR0|airplane.  No, look, there's a really 
20110124133134.000|20110124133136.000|TR0|interesting list from America watchdog of 
20110124133136.000|20110124133138.000|TR0|the new fees you could see in 2011.  And 
20110124133138.000|20110124133141.000|TR0|top on this list, right now, if you have a 
20110124133141.000|20110124133143.000|TR0|child under 2, you know, you can take that 
20110124133143.000|20110124133145.000|TR0|baby onto the plane, it sits on your lap.  
20110124133145.000|20110124133148.000|TR0|Everyone is happy.  They'll pay anything.  
20110124133148.000|20110124133150.000|TR0|Well, imagine checking the baby like you 
20110124133150.000|20110124133153.000|TR0|check a bag fee, right?
20110124133153.000|20110124133155.000|TR0|
20110124133155.000|20110124133157.000|TR0|You bring the baby on your lap and maybe 
20110124133157.000|20110124133200.000|TR0|you have to pay something.  This is among 
20110124133200.000|20110124133202.000|TR0|the things that these particular group 
20110124133202.000|20110124133204.000|TR0|things could be the airline fees that are 
20110124133204.000|20110124133207.000|TR0|next.  An infant fee of charge to hold the 
20110124133207.000|20110124133209.000|TR0|baby.  Ryan Air already does this in 
20110124133209.000|20110124133211.000|TR0|Europe, 30 bucks each way to take the 
20110124133211.000|20110124133214.000|TR0|baby.  How about an in-person check in 
20110124133214.000|20110124133216.000|TR0|fee? If you don't check in with your hand 
20110124133216.000|20110124133218.000|TR0|held device before you get to the airport, 
20110124133218.000|20110124133221.000|TR0|you do it at the airport, maybe a fee for 
20110124133221.000|20110124133223.000|TR0|that.
20110124133223.000|20110124133225.000|TR0|
20110124133225.000|20110124133228.000|TR0|How about a credit card fee, a fee for 
20110124133228.000|20110124133230.000|TR0|actually using the credit card to make the 
20110124133230.000|20110124133232.000|TR0|purchase?  This is also something that 
20110124133232.000|20110124133235.000|TR0|some European airlines are already doing 
20110124133235.000|20110124133237.000|TR0|or internet convenience fee so if you 
20110124133237.000|20110124133239.000|TR0|don't get the check in free or the credit 
20110124133239.000|20110124133242.000|TR0|card fee, you get an internet convenience 
20110124133242.000|20110124133244.000|TR0|fee.  How about a checked bag fee that's 
20110124133244.000|20110124133247.000|TR0|not just $15 or $25, but $15, and then, 
20110124133247.000|20110124133249.000|TR0|another fee on top of that for how many 
20110124133249.000|20110124133251.000|TR0|pounds it is, paying for the weight of 
20110124133251.000|20110124133254.000|TR0|your bag?  These are all things that could 
20110124133254.000|20110124133256.000|TR0|be coming to an airline near you.
20110124133256.000|20110124133258.000|TR0|
20110124133258.000|20110124133301.000|TR0|Although, I will say, in fairness, to the 
20110124133301.000|20110124133303.000|TR0|airlines, so far, they're been pretty good 
20110124133303.000|20110124133305.000|TR0|about checking all the baby gear and not 
20110124133305.000|20110124133308.000|TR0|charging you, at least, in my personal 
20110124133308.000|20110124133310.000|TR0|flight experience, but we'll see what 
20110124133310.000|20110124133312.000|TR0|could become.  The whole problem you guys 
20110124133312.000|20110124133315.000|TR0|is rising fuel prices.  Fuel costs around 
20110124133315.000|20110124133317.000|TR0|-- the cost of all kinds of commodities 
20110124133317.000|20110124133319.000|TR0|are up.  And you're probably going to see 
20110124133319.000|20110124133322.000|TR0|a lot of different ways the companies are 
20110124133322.000|20110124133324.000|TR0|going to try to recoup this, either fees 
20110124133324.000|20110124133326.000|TR0|on the one hand or you could see higher 
20110124133326.000|20110124133329.000|TR0|food prices.
20110124133329.000|20110124133331.000|TR0|
20110124133331.000|20110124133333.000|TR0|The CRB Index of some 19 commodities, 
20110124133333.000|20110124133336.000|TR0|everyone things from coffee to cocoa to 
20110124133336.000|20110124133338.000|TR0|soybean oil, to heating oil, all of these 
20110124133338.000|20110124133340.000|TR0|are going up pretty sharply, up 23 percent 
20110124133340.000|20110124133343.000|TR0|since August. You look at sugar prices, 
20110124133343.000|20110124133345.000|TR0|guys, they are up 90 percent in the past 
20110124133345.000|20110124133348.000|TR0|six months.  Wheat prices are up 95 
20110124133348.000|20110124133350.000|TR0|percent in the last six months, oil prices 
20110124133350.000|20110124133352.000|TR0|up 20 percent in the last six months.  All 
20110124133352.000|20110124133355.000|TR0|of this means that food companies, 
20110124133355.000|20110124133357.000|TR0|restaurants, airlines, everyone trying to 
20110124133357.000|20110124133359.000|TR0|figure out at what point they can pass 
20110124133359.000|20110124133402.000|TR0|these prices on to the consumer.
20110124133402.000|20110124133404.000|TR0|
20110124133404.000|20110124133406.000|TR0|So far the restaurants haven't been able 
20110124133406.000|20110124133409.000|TR0|to do it because we are so picky after the 
20110124133409.000|20110124133411.000|TR0|recession.  We're very price sensitive as 
20110124133411.000|20110124133413.000|TR0|consumers and they're been trying to 
20110124133413.000|20110124133416.000|TR0|absorb it.  But bottom line takeaway for 
20110124133416.000|20110124133418.000|TR0|you is as you prepare your family budget I 
20110124133418.000|20110124133420.000|TR0|think you can count on spending more for a 
20110124133420.000|20110124133423.000|TR0|lot of things you are using every day.
20110124133423.000|20110124133425.000|TR0|
20110124133425.000|20110124133427.000|TR0|CHETRY:  I have noticed food prices going 
20110124133427.000|20110124133430.000|TR0|up.
20110124133430.000|20110124133432.000|TR0|
20110124133432.000|20110124133434.000|TR0|ROMANS:  There is no way they can absorb 
20110124133434.000|20110124133437.000|TR0|wheat prices going up 95 percent.  And 
20110124133437.000|20110124133439.000|TR0|this is going to be a story you're going 
20110124133439.000|20110124133442.000|TR0|to see on the front page of newspapers 
20110124133442.000|20110124133444.000|TR0|around the world because this becomes a 
20110124133444.000|20110124133446.000|TR0|food security issue especially for poor 
20110124133446.000|20110124133449.000|TR0|countries.  You are going to be talking 
20110124133449.000|20110124133451.000|TR0|about food prices and food shocks I think.

20110124133453.000|20110124133456.000|TR0|HOLMES:  You gave us some good news about 
20110124133456.000|20110124133458.000|TR0|the employment situation this year but now 
20110124133458.000|20110124133500.000|TR0|we have some other things we need to worry 
20110124133500.000|20110124133503.000|TR0|about as well.
20110124133503.000|20110124133505.000|TR0|
20110124133505.000|20110124133507.000|TR0|CHETRY:  People are starting to feel it.  
20110124133507.000|20110124133510.000|TR0|You need a job to afford the sugar.
20110124133510.000|20110124133512.000|TR0|

20110124133531.000|20110124133533.000|TR0|"AMERICAN MORNING" we are keeping our eye 
20110124133533.000|20110124133536.000|TR0|on a weather situation, a couple of stops 
20110124133536.000|20110124133538.000|TR0|to tell you about.  One is going to be 
20110124133538.000|20110124133540.000|TR0|hitting the south, the other in the 
20110124133540.000|20110124133543.000|TR0|northeast.  In places it will feel like 
20110124133543.000|20110124133545.000|TR0|below zero.  This is dangerous weather, 
20110124133545.000|20110124133547.000|TR0|and two deaths are reportedly linked to 
20110124133547.000|20110124133550.000|TR0|this weather.  Again, the south could be 
20110124133550.000|20110124133552.000|TR0|seeing another storm that could bring more 
20110124133552.000|20110124133554.000|TR0|snow.

20110124133615.000|20110124133618.000|TR0|window.

20110124133620.000|20110124133622.000|TR0|HOLMES:  It was the story everybody is 
20110124133622.000|20110124133625.000|TR0|talking about last week. There is an 
20110124133625.000|20110124133627.000|TR0|update.  The fake mom is in custody.  We 
20110124133627.000|20110124133630.000|TR0|told you the story of Carlina White who 
20110124133630.000|20110124133632.000|TR0|was taken in 1987 at 19 days old.  She was 
20110124133632.000|20110124133634.000|TR0|able to link up with her real family.  Now 
20110124133634.000|20110124133637.000|TR0|her fake mom, Ann Pettway, is in custody.  
20110124133637.000|20110124133639.000|TR0|She will be in court today to face charges.
20110124133639.000|20110124133641.000|TR0|
20110124133641.000|20110124133644.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Also, Tucson shooting suspect 
20110124133644.000|20110124133646.000|TR0|Jared Loughner will be in federal court in 
20110124133646.000|20110124133648.000|TR0|Phoenix this afternoon for his arraignment 
20110124133648.000|20110124133651.000|TR0|hearing. So far he has only been charged 
20110124133651.000|20110124133653.000|TR0|including murder.  So far he's only been 
20110124133653.000|20110124133655.000|TR0|formerly charged with three counts of 
20110124133655.000|20110124133658.000|TR0|attempted murder.
20110124133658.000|20110124133700.000|TR0|
20110124133700.000|20110124133702.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And meanwhile the congresswoman 
20110124133702.000|20110124133705.000|TR0|he is accused of shooting, Gabrielle 
20110124133705.000|20110124133707.000|TR0|Giffords, we saw her transferred last week 
20110124133707.000|20110124133709.000|TR0|from Tucson where she had been the 
20110124133709.000|20110124133712.000|TR0|hospital over to Houston were she will do 
20110124133712.000|20110124133714.000|TR0|rehab.  But doctors will not let her do 
20110124133714.000|20110124133716.000|TR0|that rehab full time just yet.
20110124133716.000|20110124133719.000|TR0|
20110124133719.000|20110124133721.000|TR0|CHETRY:  She is still in the ICU this 
20110124133721.000|20110124133723.000|TR0|morning.  Senior Medical Correspondent 
20110124133723.000|20110124133726.000|TR0|Elizabeth Cohen joins us.  She was in 
20110124133726.000|20110124133728.000|TR0|Houston for the arrival of the 
20110124133728.000|20110124133731.000|TR0|congresswoman and now you're back in 
20110124133731.000|20110124133733.000|TR0|Atlanta.  So she is still in intensive 
20110124133733.000|20110124133735.000|TR0|care they say because of this fluid on the 
20110124133735.000|20110124133738.000|TR0|brain.  What's the situation?
20110124133738.000|20110124133740.000|TR0|
20110124133740.000|20110124133742.000|TR0|ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL 
20110124133742.000|20110124133745.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Let me actually show you 
20110124133745.000|20110124133747.000|TR0|what that looks like.  All of us have some 
20110124133747.000|20110124133749.000|TR0|amount of fluid in our brain.  That' 
20110124133749.000|20110124133752.000|TR0|normal.  But when you have an injury like 
20110124133752.000|20110124133754.000|TR0|she had, the fluid can build up.  Do you 
20110124133754.000|20110124133756.000|TR0|see that pink?  That is actually swelling, 
20110124133756.000|20110124133759.000|TR0|and it puts pressure on the brain, and 
20110124133759.000|20110124133801.000|TR0|that is not a good thing.  So she has a 
20110124133801.000|20110124133803.000|TR0|drain that comes out of her brain to 
20110124133803.000|20110124133806.000|TR0|outside the body to drain the fluid.  As 
20110124133806.000|20110124133808.000|TR0|long as she has the drain in her head she 
20110124133808.000|20110124133810.000|TR0|can't get out of the ICU.  She can't do 
20110124133810.000|20110124133813.000|TR0|full rehab until that drain comes out.
20110124133813.000|20110124133815.000|TR0|
20110124133815.000|20110124133817.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Elizabeth, there were so many 
20110124133817.000|20110124133820.000|TR0|little tidbits and updates about something 
20110124133820.000|20110124133822.000|TR0|new she was doing.  What is she able to do 
20110124133822.000|20110124133825.000|TR0|these days?
20110124133825.000|20110124133827.000|TR0|
20110124133827.000|20110124133829.000|TR0|COHEN:  They are surprised at her strength 
20110124133829.000|20110124133832.000|TR0|on her left side. Let's listen to one of 
20110124133832.000|20110124133834.000|TR0|her doctors named Gerard Francisco.
20110124133834.000|20110124133836.000|TR0|

20110124133841.000|20110124133843.000|TR0|DR. GERARD FRANCISCO, CHIEF MEDICAL 
20110124133843.000|20110124133846.000|TR0|OFFICER, MEMORIAL HERMANN:  At one point 
20110124133846.000|20110124133848.000|TR0|her leg was dangling from the bed and we 
20110124133848.000|20110124133850.000|TR0|asked her to bring her leg up.  After a 
20110124133850.000|20110124133853.000|TR0|couple of seconds she brought her left leg 
20110124133853.000|20110124133855.000|TR0|up without any further delay.
20110124133855.000|20110124133857.000|TR0|
20110124133857.000|20110124133900.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110124133900.000|20110124133902.000|TR0|
20110124133902.000|20110124133904.000|TR0|COHEN:  The fact she could lift the leg up 
20110124133904.000|20110124133907.000|TR0|was surprising to them.  She doesn't have 
20110124133907.000|20110124133909.000|TR0|the strength to stand on her own.  She 
20110124133909.000|20110124133911.000|TR0|also cannot quite speak.
20110124133911.000|20110124133914.000|TR0|
20110124133914.000|20110124133916.000|TR0|CHETRY:  When she does get into the rehab 
20110124133916.000|20110124133919.000|TR0|full time, the rigorous rehab, how long do 
20110124133919.000|20110124133921.000|TR0|they estimate the road to recovery is?
20110124133921.000|20110124133923.000|TR0|
20110124133923.000|20110124133926.000|TR0|COHEN:  They estimate that road to 
20110124133926.000|20110124133928.000|TR0|recovery is four to six months.  That is 
20110124133928.000|20110124133930.000|TR0|an estimate.  It could be shorter.  It 
20110124133930.000|20110124133933.000|TR0|could be longer.  I have spoken to people 
20110124133933.000|20110124133935.000|TR0|who have injuries similar to the 
20110124133935.000|20110124133937.000|TR0|congresswoman, and they say it has gone on 
20110124133937.000|20110124133940.000|TR0|for years and years.  Every month they do 
20110124133940.000|20110124133942.000|TR0|rehab and physical therapy and it gets 
20110124133942.000|20110124133944.000|TR0|better and better all the time.
20110124133944.000|20110124133947.000|TR0|
20110124133947.000|20110124133949.000|TR0|CHETRY:  All right, Elizabeth Cohen for 
20110124133949.000|20110124133951.000|TR0|us, certainly everyone is wishing her the 
20110124133951.000|20110124133954.000|TR0|best hoping she makes progress.  Thanks so 
20110124133954.000|20110124133956.000|TR0|much.
20110124133956.000|20110124133958.000|TR0|
20110124133958.000|20110124134001.000|TR0|HOLMES:  And meanwhile her husband Mark 
20110124134001.000|20110124134003.000|TR0|Kelly, the astronaut who has been by her 
20110124134003.000|20110124134005.000|TR0|side during this recovery, he wants to 
20110124134005.000|20110124134008.000|TR0|stay by her side, even if that means 
20110124134008.000|20110124134010.000|TR0|giving up a coveted spot at the State of 
20110124134010.000|20110124134012.000|TR0|the Union address.  He was invited to sit 
20110124134012.000|20110124134015.000|TR0|next to the first lady in her box.  You 
20110124134015.000|20110124134017.000|TR0|are used to seeing so many people sitting 
20110124134017.000|20110124134020.000|TR0|there.  He says he would like to stay by 
20110124134020.000|20110124134022.000|TR0|his wife's side during this recovery and 
20110124134022.000|20110124134024.000|TR0|rehab and he will not make it there.
20110124134024.000|20110124134027.000|TR0|
20110124134027.000|20110124134029.000|TR0|Meanwhile, someone who will make it -- the 
20110124134029.000|20110124134031.000|TR0|intern, Daniel Hernandez.  He is the one 
20110124134031.000|20110124134034.000|TR0|holding her hand as Gabrielle Giffords was 
20110124134034.000|20110124134036.000|TR0|leaving the scene.  He applied pressure to 
20110124134036.000|20110124134038.000|TR0|the wound and a lot of people are giving 
20110124134038.000|20110124134041.000|TR0|him credit for keeping her alive until the 
20110124134041.000|20110124134043.000|TR0|paramedics got there.  We have confirmed 
20110124134043.000|20110124134045.000|TR0|that he, in fact, has been invited to the 
20110124134045.000|20110124134048.000|TR0|State of the Union, and he'll be sitting 
20110124134048.000|20110124134050.000|TR0|in the first lady's box.
20110124134050.000|20110124134052.000|TR0|
20110124134052.000|20110124134055.000|TR0|CHETRY:  So how about the big controversy 
20110124134055.000|20110124134057.000|TR0|after the "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom."  
20110124134057.000|20110124134059.000|TR0|Amy Chua saying Chinese moms know a thing 
20110124134059.000|20110124134102.000|TR0|or two when it comes to raising children 
20110124134102.000|20110124134104.000|TR0|to be smarter.  We had a chance to talk to 
20110124134104.000|20110124134106.000|TR0|some children who were raised by their 
20110124134106.000|20110124134109.000|TR0|Asian parents about how it shapes them and 
20110124134109.000|20110124134111.000|TR0|whether or not it is the best way to 
20110124134111.000|20110124134114.000|TR0|parent.  So Alina Cho is going to share of 
20110124134114.000|20110124134116.000|TR0|that with us.
20110124134116.000|20110124134118.000|TR0|
20110124134118.000|20110124134121.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Also this morning, you are used 
20110124134121.000|20110124134123.000|TR0|to your child showing up at home with a 
20110124134123.000|20110124134125.000|TR0|report card.  What if the child brings 
20110124134125.000|20110124134128.000|TR0|home a report card for you?  Yes.  One 
20110124134128.000|20110124134130.000|TR0|state is proposing the parents get a 
20110124134130.000|20110124134132.000|TR0|grade. Is it a good idea?  The pros and 
20110124134132.000|20110124134135.000|TR0|cons are coming up next.  It is 36 minutes 
20110124134135.000|20110124134137.000|TR0|past the hour.

20110124134144.000|20110124134146.000|TR0|CHETRY:  We have an update right now on 
20110124134146.000|20110124134149.000|TR0|the breaking news this morning out of 
20110124134149.000|20110124134151.000|TR0|Ohio.  Fairport Harbor, the village, they 
20110124134151.000|20110124134153.000|TR0|were worried about needing to evacuate 
20110124134153.000|20110124134156.000|TR0|3,000 people because of multiple fires and 
20110124134156.000|20110124134158.000|TR0|the severe smell of gas.  One of our 
20110124134158.000|20110124134200.000|TR0|producers spoke to the Lake County sheriff 
20110124134200.000|20110124134203.000|TR0|there, and they all fires are believed to 
20110124134203.000|20110124134205.000|TR0|have been put out and that the officials 
20110124134205.000|20110124134208.000|TR0|have been able to turn off the gas to the 
20110124134208.000|20110124134210.000|TR0|village.
20110124134210.000|20110124134212.000|TR0|
20110124134212.000|20110124134215.000|TR0|Again, still no reports of injuries, but 
20110124134215.000|20110124134217.000|TR0|not any clear pictures as to what caused 
20110124134217.000|20110124134219.000|TR0|those fires and that gas smell in the 
20110124134219.000|20110124134222.000|TR0|first place. T.J.?
20110124134222.000|20110124134224.000|TR0|
20110124134224.000|20110124134226.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right, Kiran, thank you.
20110124134226.000|20110124134229.000|TR0|
20110124134229.000|20110124134231.000|TR0|Parents, listen up to this.  Your kid 
20110124134231.000|20110124134233.000|TR0|comes home with a report card and maybe 
20110124134233.000|20110124134236.000|TR0|they get all A's, but you as a parent, 
20110124134236.000|20110124134238.000|TR0|maybe you are just satisfactory.  Yes, 
20110124134238.000|20110124134240.000|TR0|it's possible.  Florida has introduced a 
20110124134240.000|20110124134243.000|TR0|bill now, legislation, that would actually 
20110124134243.000|20110124134245.000|TR0|require the teachers grade the parents.    
20110124134245.000|20110124134247.000|TR0|   What do "Perry's Principles" say about 
20110124134247.000|20110124134250.000|TR0|this?  Joining us Steve Perry, CNN 
20110124134250.000|20110124134252.000|TR0|education contributor and founder of the 
20110124134252.000|20110124134254.000|TR0|Capital Prep Magnet School.  I know you 
20110124134254.000|20110124134257.000|TR0|are loving this one this morning, Steve. 
20110124134257.000|20110124134259.000|TR0|Let's go back to the basic premise here.  
20110124134259.000|20110124134302.000|TR0|How much of what happens with a child 
20110124134302.000|20110124134304.000|TR0|outside of the classroom has an impact on 
20110124134304.000|20110124134306.000|TR0|their performance in the classroom?
20110124134306.000|20110124134309.000|TR0|
20110124134309.000|20110124134311.000|TR0|STEVE PERRY, CNN EDUCATION CONTRIBUTOR:  
20110124134311.000|20110124134313.000|TR0|What we know is that what happens in the 
20110124134313.000|20110124134316.000|TR0|classroom is what impacts the child's 
20110124134316.000|20110124134318.000|TR0|learning. Now, would it be nice if more 
20110124134318.000|20110124134320.000|TR0|parents knew more about how to help their 
20110124134320.000|20110124134323.000|TR0|children?  Of course.  But there is 
20110124134323.000|20110124134325.000|TR0|nothing in any teacher's training that 
20110124134325.000|20110124134327.000|TR0|would put them in a position to be able to 
20110124134327.000|20110124134330.000|TR0|effectively judge the parenting of one of 
20110124134330.000|20110124134332.000|TR0|their student's parents.  So why would we 
20110124134332.000|20110124134334.000|TR0|even consider that?
20110124134334.000|20110124134337.000|TR0|
20110124134337.000|20110124134339.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Because at what in Florida they 
20110124134339.000|20110124134341.000|TR0|say they are trying to do is get an 
20110124134341.000|20110124134344.000|TR0|assessment, if something is not going 
20110124134344.000|20110124134346.000|TR0|right at home that correlates with what is 
20110124134346.000|20110124134348.000|TR0|happening with the grades in the 
20110124134348.000|20110124134351.000|TR0|classroom. Thereby they can make a better 
20110124134351.000|20110124134353.000|TR0|assessment and help that child in some way.
20110124134353.000|20110124134355.000|TR0|
20110124134355.000|20110124134358.000|TR0|PERRY:  They are not trying to do that.  
20110124134358.000|20110124134400.000|TR0|What they are trying to do is create more 
20110124134400.000|20110124134403.000|TR0|of a stir.  What they are trying to do is 
20110124134403.000|20110124134405.000|TR0|create more of a cleavage between parents 
20110124134405.000|20110124134407.000|TR0|who already feel like they should be 
20110124134407.000|20110124134410.000|TR0|coming into school and those who already 
20110124134410.000|20110124134412.000|TR0|come in and are made to feel like they 
20110124134412.000|20110124134414.000|TR0|shouldn't be there.
20110124134414.000|20110124134417.000|TR0|
20110124134417.000|20110124134419.000|TR0|If this legislator had the least bit of 
20110124134419.000|20110124134421.000|TR0|interest in engaging parents, what she 
20110124134421.000|20110124134424.000|TR0|would do is form an opportunity for 
20110124134424.000|20110124134426.000|TR0|parents and teachers to come together, not 
20110124134426.000|20110124134428.000|TR0|grade them.  If getting a bad grade was 
20110124134428.000|20110124134431.000|TR0|impetus for people doing things right I 
20110124134431.000|20110124134433.000|TR0|would have an entire school of kids 
20110124134433.000|20110124134435.000|TR0|getting A's.
20110124134435.000|20110124134438.000|TR0|
20110124134438.000|20110124134440.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Let me put up on screen and give 
20110124134440.000|20110124134442.000|TR0|the audience an idea of what we're talking 
20110124134442.000|20110124134445.000|TR0|about here, the kinds of things they want 
20110124134445.000|20110124134447.000|TR0|to grade the parents on.  The parents are 
20110124134447.000|20110124134449.000|TR0|not going to get sent to study hall. The 
20110124134449.000|20110124134452.000|TR0|parents communication, child's attendance, 
20110124134452.000|20110124134454.000|TR0|child's homework and test prep, child's 
20110124134454.000|20110124134457.000|TR0|physical preparation for school, those 
20110124134457.000|20110124134459.000|TR0|types of things.
20110124134459.000|20110124134501.000|TR0|
20110124134501.000|20110124134504.000|TR0|And again, the legislator -- you don't 
20110124134504.000|20110124134506.000|TR0|think the legislator is interested, 
20110124134506.000|20110124134508.000|TR0|necessarily, but they are trying to do 
20110124134508.000|20110124134511.000|TR0|something that can maybe help them help 
20110124134511.000|20110124134513.000|TR0|the child.
20110124134513.000|20110124134515.000|TR0|
20110124134515.000|20110124134518.000|TR0|I know you are not a big advocate of 
20110124134518.000|20110124134520.000|TR0|anything other than an excellent teacher, 
20110124134520.000|20110124134522.000|TR0|but sometimes other people think, Steve, 
20110124134522.000|20110124134525.000|TR0|what happens outside the classroom, 
20110124134525.000|20110124134527.000|TR0|whether the child is well fed, whether 
20110124134527.000|20110124134529.000|TR0|they go to sleep on time, things like that 
20110124134529.000|20110124134532.000|TR0|affect what is happening in the classroom.
20110124134532.000|20110124134534.000|TR0|
20110124134534.000|20110124134536.000|TR0|PERRY:  T.J., I am a big proponent of 
20110124134536.000|20110124134539.000|TR0|solid proponent.  In fact, anybody who is 
20110124134539.000|20110124134541.000|TR0|not taking care of your kids, I hope you 
20110124134541.000|20110124134543.000|TR0|have a horrible day, I hope your car 
20110124134543.000|20110124134546.000|TR0|doesn't stop.  I hope you have to go out 
20110124134546.000|20110124134548.000|TR0|into the freezing cold like I do.
20110124134548.000|20110124134551.000|TR0|
20110124134551.000|20110124134553.000|TR0|But that doesn't change the fact that I am 
20110124134553.000|20110124134555.000|TR0|hired to train teachers to educate 
20110124134555.000|20110124134558.000|TR0|children.  That's what we do.  That's our 
20110124134558.000|20110124134600.000|TR0|job. And if it is too hard for you, find 
20110124134600.000|20110124134602.000|TR0|another job.  We have the responsibility 
20110124134602.000|20110124134605.000|TR0|to make sure that we educate parents to 
20110124134605.000|20110124134607.000|TR0|the ways in which they can be more helpful 
20110124134607.000|20110124134609.000|TR0|to their children, but not to grade them.
20110124134609.000|20110124134612.000|TR0|
20110124134612.000|20110124134614.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Wait a minute --
20110124134614.000|20110124134616.000|TR0|
20110124134616.000|20110124134619.000|TR0|PERRY:  Hold on.  We have parents who are 
20110124134619.000|20110124134621.000|TR0|immigrants who don't necessarily feel it 
20110124134621.000|20110124134623.000|TR0|is their responsibility to come into a 
20110124134623.000|20110124134626.000|TR0|school, because in their minds, the 
20110124134626.000|20110124134628.000|TR0|countries from which they come, the school 
20110124134628.000|20110124134630.000|TR0|got it.  The schools are responsible.  Is 
20110124134630.000|20110124134633.000|TR0|their children supposed to send home a bad 
20110124134633.000|20110124134635.000|TR0|grade for their parents?
20110124134635.000|20110124134637.000|TR0|
20110124134637.000|20110124134640.000|TR0|HOLMES:  I say what you're saying, but 
20110124134640.000|20110124134642.000|TR0|even if at school, isn't part of your 
20110124134642.000|20110124134644.000|TR0|success is you know what is going on in 
20110124134644.000|20110124134647.000|TR0|your kid's life outside of the classroom 
20110124134647.000|20110124134649.000|TR0|and you can help the child better the 
20110124134649.000|20110124134652.000|TR0|situation?  That is what they seem to be 
20110124134652.000|20110124134654.000|TR0|trying to do in Florida.
20110124134654.000|20110124134656.000|TR0|
20110124134656.000|20110124134659.000|TR0|PERRY:  No, that's not what they're trying 
20110124134659.000|20110124134701.000|TR0|to do.  What they are trying to get you 
20110124134701.000|20110124134703.000|TR0|and I on television talking about 
20110124134703.000|20110124134706.000|TR0|something that has nothing to do with 
20110124134706.000|20110124134708.000|TR0|teaching and learning.
20110124134708.000|20110124134710.000|TR0|
20110124134710.000|20110124134713.000|TR0|If they want to improve what is going on 
20110124134713.000|20110124134715.000|TR0|in the classroom, put more effective 
20110124134715.000|20110124134717.000|TR0|teachers in the classroom.  If you want to 
20110124134717.000|20110124134720.000|TR0|improve what's going on inside the school, 
20110124134720.000|20110124134722.000|TR0|put better principals inside the schools.  
20110124134722.000|20110124134724.000|TR0|Do what we know works.  Design schools 
20110124134724.000|20110124134727.000|TR0|that are more likely to be successful than 
20110124134727.000|20110124134729.000|TR0|to sit here and waste our time having 
20110124134729.000|20110124134731.000|TR0|conversations about people who are not 
20110124134731.000|20110124134734.000|TR0|necessarily the biggest impact.
20110124134734.000|20110124134736.000|TR0|
20110124134736.000|20110124134738.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Parents are not the biggest 
20110124134738.000|20110124134741.000|TR0|impact?
20110124134741.000|20110124134743.000|TR0|
20110124134743.000|20110124134746.000|TR0|PERRY:  Hear my point.  Parents are 
20110124134746.000|20110124134748.000|TR0|important.  But if your child gets a D on 
20110124134748.000|20110124134750.000|TR0|a test, is it your fault?
20110124134750.000|20110124134753.000|TR0|
20110124134753.000|20110124134755.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Maybe you didn't get them up and 
20110124134755.000|20110124134757.000|TR0|studying like they should have been.  
20110124134757.000|20110124134800.000|TR0|Maybe they didn't get in bed on time, get 
20110124134800.000|20110124134802.000|TR0|a breakfast, possibly, yes, it is the 
20110124134802.000|20110124134804.000|TR0|parents' fault.
20110124134804.000|20110124134807.000|TR0|
20110124134807.000|20110124134809.000|TR0|PERRY:  No.  Where we are not taking real 
20110124134809.000|20110124134811.000|TR0|thought in this is we are not looking at 
20110124134811.000|20110124134814.000|TR0|the fact that different children learn 
20110124134814.000|20110124134816.000|TR0|differently. And if I am going to be held 
20110124134816.000|20110124134818.000|TR0|responsible for my child learning 
20110124134818.000|20110124134821.000|TR0|chemistry and I can't teach my child 
20110124134821.000|20110124134823.000|TR0|chemistry, then what am I paying the 
20110124134823.000|20110124134825.000|TR0|teacher to do?
20110124134825.000|20110124134828.000|TR0|
20110124134828.000|20110124134830.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right, Steve, we can't finish 
20110124134830.000|20110124134832.000|TR0|it.  I have to call you after the who 
20110124134832.000|20110124134835.000|TR0|again.

20110124134842.000|20110124134844.000|TR0|I have to get out of your office.  Steve, 
20110124134844.000|20110124134847.000|TR0|good to see you, as always.
20110124134847.000|20110124134849.000|TR0|
20110124134849.000|20110124134851.000|TR0|PERRY:  Get out before I make you stand up 
20110124134851.000|20110124134854.000|TR0|like I do everybody else that's in trouble.
20110124134854.000|20110124134856.000|TR0|
20110124134856.000|20110124134858.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Kiran, please take this away.     
20110124134858.000|20110124134901.000|TR0|CHETRY:  Right, you don't consider that 
20110124134901.000|20110124134903.000|TR0|punishment?
20110124134903.000|20110124134905.000|TR0|

20110124134910.000|20110124134912.000|TR0|Well, bitter cold in the northeast, heavy 
20110124134912.000|20110124134915.000|TR0|rain in the southeast, and weather on the 
20110124134915.000|20110124134917.000|TR0|move.  Our Rob Marciano tells us what we 
20110124134917.000|20110124134919.000|TR0|can expect coming up in the middle of the

20110124134929.000|20110124134931.000|TR0|CHETRY:  We have some breaking news right 
20110124134931.000|20110124134934.000|TR0|now happening in St. Petersburg, Florida, 
20110124134934.000|20110124134936.000|TR0|where a local affiliate is reporting 
20110124134936.000|20110124134938.000|TR0|police officers shot.  They say that they 
20110124134938.000|20110124134941.000|TR0|are now investigating what happened on the 
20110124134941.000|20110124134943.000|TR0|city's south side that one and possibly 
20110124134943.000|20110124134945.000|TR0|two police officers may have been shot or 
20110124134945.000|20110124134948.000|TR0|have been shot actually and that crews 
20110124134948.000|20110124134950.000|TR0|have now surrounded a house in an area 
20110124134950.000|20110124134952.000|TR0|where they believe the suspects could 
20110124134952.000|20110124134955.000|TR0|actually be hiding out in the attic.
20110124134955.000|20110124134957.000|TR0|
20110124134957.000|20110124134959.000|TR0|Again, this is breaking news so we're not 
20110124134959.000|20110124135002.000|TR0|getting many details right now.  But we do 
20110124135002.000|20110124135004.000|TR0|know that they are now looking for a 
20110124135004.000|20110124135006.000|TR0|suspect that shot one and perhaps two 
20110124135006.000|20110124135009.000|TR0|police officers in St. Petersburg, Florida.
20110124135009.000|20110124135011.000|TR0|
20110124135011.000|20110124135013.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Well, we want to turn from that 
20110124135013.000|20110124135016.000|TR0|breaking news to give you an update on 
20110124135016.000|20110124135018.000|TR0|another breaking story we are watching 
20110124135018.000|20110124135020.000|TR0|this morning. This is out of Ohio, just 
20110124135020.000|20110124135023.000|TR0|about 30 miles outside of Cleveland, where 
20110124135023.000|20110124135025.000|TR0|an entire neighborhood, authorities were 
20110124135025.000|20110124135027.000|TR0|thinking about the possibility of 
20110124135027.000|20110124135030.000|TR0|evacuating some 3,000 people.
20110124135030.000|20110124135032.000|TR0|
20110124135032.000|20110124135035.000|TR0|This is the bottom of your screen, ignore 
20110124135035.000|20110124135037.000|TR0|that part of it, there you go.  Take that 
20110124135037.000|20110124135039.000|TR0|down, that's a different story we will get 
20110124135039.000|20110124135042.000|TR0|to in a second.  But this one has to do 
20110124135042.000|20110124135044.000|TR0|with what they thought was a gas leak in a 
20110124135044.000|20110124135046.000|TR0|neighborhood that some kind of sparked at 
20110124135046.000|20110124135049.000|TR0|least five fires at five different homes 
20110124135049.000|20110124135051.000|TR0|in that area.
20110124135051.000|20110124135053.000|TR0|
20110124135053.000|20110124135056.000|TR0|They do have the gas shut off at this 
20110124135056.000|20110124135058.000|TR0|point.  But again, the police department 
20110124135058.000|20110124135100.000|TR0|or fire department was called out, 17 fire 
20110124135100.000|20110124135103.000|TR0|departments all together, that's all of 
20110124135103.000|20110124135105.000|TR0|them in the county, there for the 
20110124135105.000|20110124135107.000|TR0|possibility of evacuating.
20110124135107.000|20110124135110.000|TR0|
20110124135110.000|20110124135112.000|TR0|We don't have word of any injuries there.  
20110124135112.000|20110124135114.000|TR0|There was the smell of gas reported in the 
20110124135114.000|20110124135117.000|TR0|area as well.  But they had the gas out, 
20110124135117.000|20110124135119.000|TR0|but still they may be trying to evacuate 
20110124135119.000|20110124135121.000|TR0|some 3,000 people because of this gas leak.
20110124135121.000|20110124135124.000|TR0|
20110124135124.000|20110124135126.000|TR0|And things are just going from bad to 
20110124135126.000|20110124135129.000|TR0|worse in Washington, D.C. The inner loop 
20110124135129.000|20110124135131.000|TR0|of the Beltway and a lot of the morning 
20110124135131.000|20110124135133.000|TR0|commute snarled up because of this.  A 
20110124135133.000|20110124135136.000|TR0|water main break ended up shutting down 
20110124135136.000|20110124135138.000|TR0|the inner loop in -- in Maryland, Prince 
20110124135138.000|20110124135140.000|TR0|Georgia's county.  And there are now a lot 
20110124135140.000|20110124135143.000|TR0|of traffic problems because of this.
20110124135143.000|20110124135145.000|TR0|
20110124135145.000|20110124135147.000|TR0|They say the Beltway is closed between 
20110124135147.000|20110124135150.000|TR0|exit 15 and exit 11 because of it actually 
20110124135150.000|20110124135152.000|TR0|-- water drifting on to the roads and 
20110124135152.000|20110124135154.000|TR0|because it is so cold, freezing.  They say 
20110124135154.000|20110124135157.000|TR0|that already one car accident attributed 
20110124135157.000|20110124135159.000|TR0|to that gas -- to that water main break, 
20110124135159.000|20110124135201.000|TR0|rather.  So, quite a mess; a couple of 
20110124135201.000|20110124135204.000|TR0|area schools on a two-hour delay trying to 
20110124135204.000|20110124135206.000|TR0|deal with that as well.
20110124135206.000|20110124135208.000|TR0|
20110124135208.000|20110124135211.000|TR0|HOLMES:  Now, let's turn to Rob Marciano 
20110124135211.000|20110124135213.000|TR0|now.  Rob, can you give us an idea just 
20110124135213.000|20110124135215.000|TR0|how cold is it in that area right now, in 
20110124135215.000|20110124135218.000|TR0|the Washington, D.C. Area?
20110124135218.000|20110124135220.000|TR0|
20110124135220.000|20110124135223.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  It's 19 
20110124135223.000|20110124135225.000|TR0|degrees.
20110124135225.000|20110124135227.000|TR0|
20110124135227.000|20110124135230.000|TR0|HOLMES:  All right.
20110124135230.000|20110124135232.000|TR0|
20110124135232.000|20110124135234.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  So -- you know plenty cold to 
20110124135234.000|20110124135237.000|TR0|freeze water on the roadways even when 
20110124135237.000|20110124135239.000|TR0|it's moving.  So you got the temperatures 
20110124135239.000|20110124135241.000|TR0|that are -- you know well over ten degrees 
20110124135241.000|20110124135244.000|TR0|below the freezing mark, and really 
20110124135244.000|20110124135246.000|TR0|doesn't -- of course, it doesn't matter 
20110124135246.000|20110124135248.000|TR0|what the wind is doing, that's going to 
20110124135248.000|20110124135251.000|TR0|freeze it.
20110124135251.000|20110124135253.000|TR0|
20110124135253.000|20110124135255.000|TR0|Ten degrees right now in Philadelphia.  
20110124135255.000|20110124135258.000|TR0|Further north you go as this should be the 
20110124135258.000|20110124135300.000|TR0|colder it gets but the temperature is just 
20110124135300.000|20110124135302.000|TR0|falling off the table the farther north 
20110124135302.000|20110124135305.000|TR0|you go.  Minus 12 in Albany right now and 
20110124135305.000|20110124135307.000|TR0|minus two in Boston; you factor in the 
20110124135307.000|20110124135309.000|TR0|wind and the wind chill. And what it feels 
20110124135309.000|20110124135312.000|TR0|like against your bare skin it feels like 
20110124135312.000|20110124135314.000|TR0|minus eight or eight below -- below zero 
20110124135314.000|20110124135316.000|TR0|in New York.  Minus 21 in Albany, minus 21 
20110124135316.000|20110124135319.000|TR0|as well in Boston -- these are dangerously 
20110124135319.000|20110124135321.000|TR0|cold wind chills that haven't really 
20110124135321.000|20110124135324.000|TR0|warmed up much in the past couple of hours 
20110124135324.000|20110124135326.000|TR0|and really won't warm up much in the next 
20110124135326.000|20110124135328.000|TR0|couple until you get into this afternoon 
20110124135328.000|20110124135331.000|TR0|and you get onto the sunshine it will get 
20110124135331.000|20110124135333.000|TR0|a little more bearable.
20110124135333.000|20110124135335.000|TR0|
20110124135335.000|20110124135338.000|TR0|But it's dangerously cold for sure.  21 
20110124135338.000|20110124135340.000|TR0|degrees if you're lucky for the high 
20110124135340.000|20110124135342.000|TR0|temperature in New York City.  A little 
20110124135342.000|20110124135345.000|TR0|bit warmer in Atlanta and warming up a 
20110124135345.000|20110124135347.000|TR0|little bit across the plains which had 
20110124135347.000|20110124135349.000|TR0|drastically cold temperatures over the 
20110124135349.000|20110124135352.000|TR0|weekend.  A reinforcing shot of cool air 
20110124135352.000|20110124135354.000|TR0|-- can you hear that?  We've got a little 
20110124135354.000|20110124135356.000|TR0|construction going on down in the ATL.
20110124135356.000|20110124135359.000|TR0|
20110124135359.000|20110124135401.000|TR0|Guys we're doing live TV.  Thanks very 
20110124135401.000|20110124135403.000|TR0|much.  Detroit to Cleveland this is very 
20110124135403.000|20110124135406.000|TR0|light precip happening.  It shouldn't 
20110124135406.000|20110124135408.000|TR0|amount a whole lot.  This precip down 
20110124135408.000|20110124135410.000|TR0|there across parts of upper Texas coast 
20110124135410.000|20110124135413.000|TR0|will increase in intensity and move across 
20110124135413.000|20110124135415.000|TR0|parts of the southeast. This is beneficial 
20110124135415.000|20110124135418.000|TR0|rain and it will be mostly rain we think.  
20110124135418.000|20110124135420.000|TR0|Even though there's been cold air in place.
20110124135420.000|20110124135422.000|TR0|
20110124135422.000|20110124135425.000|TR0|We were fearing a snow and ice storm 
20110124135425.000|20110124135427.000|TR0|again, but it looks like the storm track 
20110124135427.000|20110124135429.000|TR0|from this system will be a little bit 
20110124135429.000|20110124135432.000|TR0|farther north.  It will bring a little bit 
20110124135432.000|20110124135434.000|TR0|more warm air and it will be mostly rain 
20110124135434.000|20110124135436.000|TR0|at least until it gets to the Carolinas.  
20110124135436.000|20110124135439.000|TR0|The backside of this may bring a little 
20110124135439.000|20110124135441.000|TR0|bit of snow across parts of Tennessee and 
20110124135441.000|20110124135443.000|TR0|north Georgia.  And the front side of this 
20110124135443.000|20110124135446.000|TR0|as it moves up -- up the coastline 
20110124135446.000|20110124135448.000|TR0|Wednesday and Thursday that brings in the 
20110124135448.000|20110124135450.000|TR0|sleet and snow mixture from D.C. up to New

20110124135457.000|20110124135500.000|TR0|winter.  It looks like you'll get a little 
20110124135500.000|20110124135502.000|TR0|more -- wintry precip as we get towards

20110124135540.000|20110124135542.000|TR0|Georgia upset about what they're being 
20110124135542.000|20110124135544.000|TR0|told they can and cannot wear to high 
20110124135544.000|20110124135547.000|TR0|school.  This is Cross Creek High School 
20110124135547.000|20110124135549.000|TR0|in Augusta, Georgia.  Students were 
20110124135549.000|20110124135551.000|TR0|actually putting together a protest 
20110124135551.000|20110124135554.000|TR0|because of an outright ban on anything 
20110124135554.000|20110124135556.000|TR0|camouflage -- any camouflage clothing.
20110124135556.000|20110124135558.000|TR0|
20110124135558.000|20110124135601.000|TR0|Well, the principal is coming back now and 
20110124135601.000|20110124135603.000|TR0|wants to clarify his position.  He's says, 
20110124135603.000|20110124135606.000|TR0|"I'm not saying you can't wear this stuff 
20110124135606.000|20110124135608.000|TR0|at all, I'm just encouraging you to keep 
20110124135608.000|20110124135610.000|TR0|that stuff in your lockers and not wear it 
20110124135610.000|20110124135613.000|TR0|around school in particular because of 
20110124135613.000|20110124135615.000|TR0|your safety." There were two students who 
20110124135615.000|20110124135617.000|TR0|are wearing camouflage gear when they were

20110124135627.000|20110124135629.000|TR0|could be a thing of the past in Georgia.

20110124135634.000|20110124135636.000|TR0|Department of Education decided perhaps 
20110124135636.000|20110124135638.000|TR0|cursive writing not the most important 
20110124135638.000|20110124135641.000|TR0|thing to include in its performance

20110124135659.000|20110124135702.000|TR0|technology we have.  At the time cursive 
20110124135702.000|20110124135704.000|TR0|was important that was the best technology 
20110124135704.000|20110124135707.000|TR0|that we had, was pen and ink on a piece of

20110124135803.000|20110124135805.000|TR0|practice then it starts to go.

20110124135916.000|20110124135918.000|TR0|to evacuate a senior center.  But it looks 
20110124135918.000|20110124135920.000|TR0|like they have solved it for now.  Got the 
20110124135920.000|20110124135923.000|TR0|gas shutoff, so that's a big deal but the
