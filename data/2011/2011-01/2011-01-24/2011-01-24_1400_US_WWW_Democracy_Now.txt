20110124140029.303|20110124140031.163|TR0|The attorney for alleged army 
20110124140031.163|20110124140033.024|TR0|whistleblower Bradley Manning is 
20110124140033.024|20110124140034.884|TR0|accusing the military of 
20110124140034.884|20110124140036.745|TR0|intensifying their harsh 
20110124140036.745|20110124140038.606|TR0|treatment of Manning as he 
20110124140038.606|20110124140040.466|TR0|remains behind bars. The lawyer, 
20110124140040.466|20110124140042.327|TR0|David Coombs, says Manning was 
20110124140042.327|20110124140044.187|TR0|placed on a stricter suicide 
20110124140044.187|20110124140046.048|TR0|watch last week despite 
20110124140046.048|20110124140047.909|TR0|psychiatric reviews showing he 
20110124140047.909|20110124140049.769|TR0|is not a suicide risk and should 
20110124140049.769|20110124140051.630|TR0|even be taken off a less 
20110124140051.630|20110124140053.491|TR0|restrictive "prevention of 
20110124140053.491|20110124140055.351|TR0|injury watch." According to 
20110124140055.351|20110124140057.212|TR0|Coombs, the military revoked 
20110124140057.212|20110124140059.072|TR0|Manning's lone hour of exercise 
20110124140059.072|20110124140100.933|TR0|and stripped him of all his 
20110124140100.933|20110124140102.794|TR0|clothing except for his 
20110124140102.794|20110124140104.654|TR0|underwear. Manning was 
20110124140104.654|20110124140106.515|TR0|ultimately returned to 
20110124140106.515|20110124140108.375|TR0|"prevention of injury" status 
20110124140108.375|20110124140110.236|TR0|after Coombs complained. The 
20110124140110.236|20110124140112.097|TR0|military is also cracking down 
20110124140112.097|20110124140113.957|TR0|on Manning's visitors. On 
20110124140113.957|20110124140115.818|TR0|Sunday, Manning's friend David 
20110124140115.818|20110124140117.678|TR0|House and progressive blogger 
20110124140117.678|20110124140119.539|TR0|Jane Hamsher were detained and 
20110124140119.539|20110124140121.400|TR0|prevented from visiting him at 
20110124140121.400|20110124140123.260|TR0|the Quantico military base in 
20110124140123.260|20110124140125.121|TR0|Virginia. They had brought with

20110124140128.842|20110124140130.703|TR0|conditions. House has publicly 
20110124140130.703|20110124140132.563|TR0|alleged that Manning's mental 
20110124140132.563|20110124140134.424|TR0|and physical health has declined 
20110124140134.424|20110124140136.285|TR0|under 23-hour-a-day solitary 
20110124140136.285|20110124140138.145|TR0|confinement. The pair were 
20110124140138.145|20110124140140.006|TR0|detained for two hours and 
20110124140140.006|20110124140141.866|TR0|released only after Manning's 
20110124140141.866|20110124140143.727|TR0|allotted visitation period had 
20110124140143.727|20110124140145.588|TR0|expired.

20110124140202.333|20110124140204.194|TR0|for obstruction of justice and

20110124140206.054|20110124140207.915|TR0|into making confessions. Burge 
20110124140207.915|20110124140209.776|TR0|was convicted in June following 
20110124140209.776|20110124140211.636|TR0|longtime accusations of 
20110124140211.636|20110124140213.497|TR0|overseeing the systematic 
20110124140213.497|20110124140215.357|TR0|torture of more than a hundred 
20110124140215.357|20110124140217.218|TR0|African American men. The police 
20110124140217.218|20110124140219.079|TR0|department fired him in 1993 for 
20110124140219.079|20110124140220.939|TR0|mistreatment of a suspect, but 
20110124140220.939|20110124140222.800|TR0|did not press charges. Burge was 
20110124140222.800|20110124140224.661|TR0|ultimately indicted in 2007 - 
20110124140224.661|20110124140226.521|TR0|not for the torture itself, but 
20110124140226.521|20110124140228.382|TR0|for lying about it. After the

20110124141516.814|20110124141518.675|TR0|The disclosure is among many 
20110124141518.675|20110124141520.536|TR0|contained in what's being called 
20110124141520.536|20110124141522.396|TR0|the "Palestine Papers" - 
20110124141522.396|20110124141524.257|TR0|thousands of pages of

20110124141527.978|20110124141529.839|TR0|negotiations with Israel. It's 
20110124141529.839|20110124141531.699|TR0|being described as the biggest

20110124141533.560|20110124141535.421|TR0|in the history of the Middle

20110124141537.281|20110124141539.142|TR0|1,700 files cover a period from 
20110124141539.142|20110124141541.002|TR0|1999 to 2010. They were obtained 
20110124141541.002|20110124141542.863|TR0|by the TV news network Al

20110124141554.027|20110124141555.887|TR0|Jerusalem are the most 
20110124141555.887|20110124141557.748|TR0|controversial. Minutes from a 
20110124141557.748|20110124141559.609|TR0|2008 meeting indicate 
20110124141559.609|20110124141601.469|TR0|Palestinian negotiators offered 
20110124141601.469|20110124141603.330|TR0|to allow Israel's annexation of 
20110124141603.330|20110124141605.190|TR0|all but one of the settlements 
20110124141605.190|20110124141607.051|TR0|built illegally in occupied East

20110124141614.493|20110124141616.354|TR0|Saeb Erekat is quoted as saying, 
20110124141616.354|20110124141618.215|TR0|"We are offering you the biggest 
20110124141618.215|20110124141620.075|TR0|Yerushalayim in Jewish history," 
20110124141620.075|20110124141621.936|TR0|using the Hebrew word for 
20110124141621.936|20110124141623.797|TR0|Jerusalem. But Israel apparently 
20110124141623.797|20110124141625.657|TR0|rejected the offer. Then-Israeli 
20110124141625.657|20110124141627.518|TR0|foreign minister Tzipi Livni 
20110124141627.518|20110124141629.378|TR0|told the Palestinians, quote, 
20110124141629.378|20110124141631.239|TR0|"We do not like this suggestion 
20110124141631.239|20110124141633.100|TR0|because it does not meet our 
20110124141633.100|20110124141634.960|TR0|demands, and probably it was not 
20110124141634.960|20110124141636.821|TR0|easy for you to think about it, 
20110124141636.821|20110124141638.681|TR0|but I really appreciate it."

20110124141740.082|20110124141741.942|TR0|Welcome to Democracy Now!, 
20110124141741.942|20110124141743.803|TR0|Professor Khalidi. Can you 
20110124141743.803|20110124141745.663|TR0|respond to this trove of 
20110124141745.663|20110124141747.524|TR0|documents that Al Jazeera 
20110124141747.524|20110124141749.385|TR0|[inaudible] -
20110124141749.385|20110124141751.245|TR0|
20110124141751.245|20110124141753.106|TR0|>> RASHID KHALIDI: Well, this 
20110124141753.106|20110124141754.967|TR0|was the first of what is 
20110124141754.967|20110124141756.827|TR0|supposed to be four days of 
20110124141756.827|20110124141758.688|TR0|revelations of documents by Al 
20110124141758.688|20110124141800.548|TR0|Jazeera and by the British paper 
20110124141800.548|20110124141802.409|TR0|The Guardian. The concentration 
20110124141802.409|20110124141804.270|TR0|in the first group seems to have 
20110124141804.270|20110124141806.130|TR0|been on Jerusalem. And the 
20110124141806.130|20110124141807.991|TR0|revelations are quite striking. 
20110124141807.991|20110124141809.851|TR0|The most important, I think, is 
20110124141809.851|20110124141811.712|TR0|the degree to which not only 
20110124141811.712|20110124141813.573|TR0|Palestinian negotiators were 
20110124141813.573|20110124141815.433|TR0|forthcoming, but the degree to 
20110124141815.433|20110124141817.294|TR0|which the Israelis were 
20110124141817.294|20110124141819.154|TR0|unwilling to accept concessions. 
20110124141819.154|20110124141821.015|TR0|It seriously casts into doubt 
20110124141821.015|20110124141822.876|TR0|the idea that Israel would 
20110124141822.876|20110124141824.736|TR0|accept anything but complete 
20110124141824.736|20110124141826.597|TR0|capitulation by the Palestinians 
20110124141826.597|20110124141828.458|TR0|to absolutely everything they're 
20110124141828.458|20110124141830.318|TR0|demanding on every front. We've 
20110124141830.318|20110124141832.179|TR0|heard about Jerusalem. There is 
20110124141832.179|20110124141834.039|TR0|presumably more to come.
20110124141834.039|20110124141835.900|TR0|
20110124141835.900|20110124141837.761|TR0|But another thing that comes out 
20110124141837.761|20110124141839.621|TR0|very strikingly from these 
20110124141839.621|20110124141841.482|TR0|documents is the degree to which 
20110124141841.482|20110124141843.342|TR0|the United States is twisting 
20110124141843.342|20110124141845.203|TR0|the arm of the Palestinians, the 
20110124141845.203|20110124141847.064|TR0|degree to which American 
20110124141847.064|20110124141848.924|TR0|diplomats, whether Hillary 
20110124141848.924|20110124141850.785|TR0|Rodham Clinton or Secretary of 
20110124141850.785|20110124141852.645|TR0|State Condoleezza Rice during 
20110124141852.645|20110124141854.506|TR0|the previous administration, are 
20110124141854.506|20110124141856.367|TR0|unsympathetic to the 
20110124141856.367|20110124141858.227|TR0|Palestinians and are in cahoots, 
20110124141858.227|20110124141900.088|TR0|in Aaron David Miller's words, 
20110124141900.088|20110124141901.949|TR0|our lawyers for Israel - it's 
20110124141901.949|20110124141903.809|TR0|actually worse than Miller, who 
20110124141903.809|20110124141905.670|TR0|was involved in the negotiations 
20110124141905.670|20110124141907.530|TR0|for many years, says, from these 
20110124141907.530|20110124141909.391|TR0|documents.
20110124141909.391|20110124141911.252|TR0|
20110124141911.252|20110124141913.112|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, what about 
20110124141913.112|20110124141914.973|TR0|Saeb Erekat saying this is all 
20110124141914.973|20110124141916.833|TR0|"a pack of lies"?
20110124141916.833|20110124141918.694|TR0|
20110124141918.694|20110124141920.555|TR0|>> RASHID KHALIDI: Well, both Al 
20110124141920.555|20110124141922.415|TR0|Jazeera and The Guardian have 
20110124141922.415|20110124141924.276|TR0|claimed that they have very 
20110124141924.276|20110124141926.136|TR0|carefully investigated the 
20110124141926.136|20110124141927.997|TR0|provenance of these documents. I 
20110124141927.997|20110124141929.858|TR0|think time will tell. We have - 
20110124141929.858|20110124141931.718|TR0|I have no way of knowing. I 
20110124141931.718|20110124141933.579|TR0|think none of us have any way of 
20110124141933.579|20110124141935.440|TR0|knowing exactly where they come 
20110124141935.440|20110124141937.300|TR0|from. We are told that many of 
20110124141937.300|20110124141939.161|TR0|them come from the negotiation 
20110124141939.161|20110124141941.021|TR0|support unit. Watching Al 
20110124141941.021|20110124141942.882|TR0|Jazeera last night, it was clear 
20110124141942.882|20110124141944.743|TR0|to me that they look like they 
20110124141944.743|20110124141946.603|TR0|come from within the Palestinian 
20110124141946.603|20110124141948.464|TR0|negotiating team, in terms of 
20110124141948.464|20110124141950.324|TR0|letterhead and so forth. Whether 
20110124141950.324|20110124141952.185|TR0|there could be forgeries among 
20110124141952.185|20110124141954.046|TR0|them, nobody knows.
20110124141954.046|20110124141955.906|TR0|
20110124141955.906|20110124141957.767|TR0|But many of these things, I 
20110124141957.767|20110124141959.628|TR0|think, fit the outlines of what 
20110124141959.628|20110124142001.488|TR0|we all knew, partly because 
20110124142001.488|20110124142003.349|TR0|people on the Israeli side, on 
20110124142003.349|20110124142005.209|TR0|the Palestinian side and the 
20110124142005.209|20110124142007.070|TR0|American side have said a great 
20110124142007.070|20110124142008.931|TR0|deal about the negotiations, 
20110124142008.931|20110124142010.791|TR0|from 1999 certainly through 
20110124142010.791|20110124142012.652|TR0|2008, and the broad lines of 
20110124142012.652|20110124142014.512|TR0|these major concessions made by 
20110124142014.512|20110124142016.373|TR0|the Palestinian Authority in 
20110124142016.373|20110124142018.234|TR0|Ramallah, the broad lines of the 
20110124142018.234|20110124142020.094|TR0|intransigence of Israel in 
20110124142020.094|20110124142021.955|TR0|simply refusing to accept 
20110124142021.955|20110124142023.815|TR0|concessions, or rather, banking 
20110124142023.815|20110124142025.676|TR0|concessions and then saying, 
20110124142025.676|20110124142027.537|TR0|"Well, now we want more. It's 
20110124142027.537|20110124142029.397|TR0|not enough for you to give up 
20110124142029.397|20110124142031.258|TR0|every single settlement in 
20110124142031.258|20110124142033.119|TR0|Jerusalem except one; we want 
20110124142033.119|20110124142034.979|TR0|all of them. It's not enough for 
20110124142034.979|20110124142036.840|TR0|you to say that you would make 
20110124142036.840|20110124142038.700|TR0|concessions inside the Old City 
20110124142038.700|20110124142040.561|TR0|of Jerusalem; we want more, as 
20110124142040.561|20110124142042.422|TR0|far as the Haram-al-Sharif is 
20110124142042.422|20110124142044.282|TR0|concerned." The detail is what 
20110124142044.282|20110124142046.143|TR0|is the most striking. And I 
20110124142046.143|20110124142048.003|TR0|seriously doubt that, in some 
20110124142048.003|20110124142049.864|TR0|cases, somebody went to the 
20110124142049.864|20110124142051.725|TR0|trouble of forging things that 
20110124142051.725|20110124142053.585|TR0|showed exactly how this process 
20110124142053.585|20110124142055.446|TR0|took place. So, I think that 
20110124142055.446|20110124142057.306|TR0|we're going to find that most of 
20110124142057.306|20110124142059.167|TR0|these documents probably are 
20110124142059.167|20110124142101.028|TR0|genuine.
20110124142101.028|20110124142102.888|TR0|
20110124142102.888|20110124142104.749|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Professor 
20110124142104.749|20110124142106.610|TR0|Khalidi, what most struck you in 
20110124142106.610|20110124142108.470|TR0|these documents about the 
20110124142108.470|20110124142110.331|TR0|communities that the PA was 
20110124142110.331|20110124142112.191|TR0|willing to give up?
20110124142112.191|20110124142114.052|TR0|
20110124142114.052|20110124142115.913|TR0|>> RASHID KHALIDI: Well, in 
20110124142115.913|20110124142117.773|TR0|Jerusalem, there are several 
20110124142117.773|20110124142119.634|TR0|issues. One is that the United 
20110124142119.634|20110124142121.494|TR0|States, which claims to support 
20110124142121.494|20110124142123.355|TR0|the position which is 
20110124142123.355|20110124142125.216|TR0|undergirded by international 
20110124142125.216|20110124142127.076|TR0|law, that all settlement - 
20110124142127.076|20110124142128.937|TR0|across the Green Line, all 
20110124142128.937|20110124142130.797|TR0|settlement in occupied 
20110124142130.797|20110124142132.658|TR0|territories is illegal, is a 
20110124142132.658|20110124142134.519|TR0|violation of the Fourth Geneva 
20110124142134.519|20110124142136.379|TR0|Convention, is basically pushing 
20110124142136.379|20110124142138.240|TR0|the Palestinians to make 
20110124142138.240|20110124142140.101|TR0|concessions on that principle, 
20110124142140.101|20110124142141.961|TR0|arguing that you will not have a 
20110124142141.961|20110124142143.822|TR0|deal - I believe this was 
20110124142143.822|20110124142145.682|TR0|Secretary Rice - you will not 
20110124142145.682|20110124142147.543|TR0|have a deal unless you give up - 
20110124142147.543|20110124142149.404|TR0|I think they were talking about 
20110124142149.404|20110124142151.264|TR0|Ma'ale Adumim, a settlement to 
20110124142151.264|20110124142153.125|TR0|the east of Jerusalem, which in 
20110124142153.125|20110124142154.985|TR0|fact, apparently, the 
20110124142154.985|20110124142156.846|TR0|Palestinians accepted to give 
20110124142156.846|20110124142158.707|TR0|up. The point here is, this is 
20110124142158.707|20110124142200.567|TR0|Palestinian land, private 
20110124142200.567|20110124142202.428|TR0|property in many cases, across 
20110124142202.428|20110124142204.289|TR0|the Green Line in territory 
20110124142204.289|20110124142206.149|TR0|illegally occupied by Israel and 
20110124142206.149|20110124142208.010|TR0|into which Israel has been 
20110124142208.010|20110124142209.870|TR0|exporting its population, in 
20110124142209.870|20110124142211.731|TR0|violation, again, of the Fourth 
20110124142211.731|20110124142213.592|TR0|Geneva Convention. That the 
20110124142213.592|20110124142215.452|TR0|United States should support a 
20110124142215.452|20110124142217.313|TR0|position in violation of 
20110124142217.313|20110124142219.173|TR0|international law might not be 
20110124142219.173|20110124142221.034|TR0|terribly shocking, but to see it 
20110124142221.034|20110124142222.895|TR0|laid out in this form, I think, 
20110124142222.895|20110124142224.755|TR0|calls into question, at the very 
20110124142224.755|20110124142226.616|TR0|least, not just the good faith 
20110124142226.616|20110124142228.476|TR0|of the American negotiators and 
20110124142228.476|20110124142230.337|TR0|of the United States in this 
20110124142230.337|20110124142232.198|TR0|process, but the good sense of 
20110124142232.198|20110124142234.058|TR0|anyone who would rely on the 
20110124142234.058|20110124142235.919|TR0|United States as an interlocutor 
20110124142235.919|20110124142237.780|TR0|or an intermediary with Israel.
20110124142237.780|20110124142239.640|TR0|
20110124142239.640|20110124142241.501|TR0|Other things that were 
20110124142241.501|20110124142243.361|TR0|discussed, such as the 
20110124142243.361|20110124142245.222|TR0|Haram-al-Sharif, might be very 
20110124142245.222|20110124142247.083|TR0|shocking to people in the Arab 
20110124142247.083|20110124142248.943|TR0|and Muslim worlds, because it 
20110124142248.943|20110124142250.804|TR0|appears that the Palestinian 
20110124142250.804|20110124142252.664|TR0|Authority has agreed to some 
20110124142252.664|20110124142254.525|TR0|kind of shared sovereignty over 
20110124142254.525|20110124142256.386|TR0|one of the three most holy sites 
20110124142256.386|20110124142258.246|TR0|in Islam, a property that is a 
20110124142258.246|20110124142300.107|TR0|piece of territory that's not 
20110124142300.107|20110124142301.967|TR0|just sacred but is also the 
20110124142301.967|20110124142303.828|TR0|property of the Islamic Waqf in 
20110124142303.828|20110124142305.689|TR0|Jerusalem, and have accepted 
20110124142305.689|20110124142307.549|TR0|that a committee of 
20110124142307.549|20110124142309.410|TR0|international actors, none of 
20110124142309.410|20110124142311.271|TR0|whom are particularly 
20110124142311.271|20110124142313.131|TR0|sympathetic to the Palestinian 
20110124142313.131|20110124142314.992|TR0|side - Arabia, Britain, the 
20110124142314.992|20110124142316.852|TR0|United States and so forth, 
20110124142316.852|20110124142318.713|TR0|Egypt and so forth - should 
20110124142318.713|20110124142320.574|TR0|somehow have control over this 
20110124142320.574|20110124142322.434|TR0|most holy site in all of 
20110124142322.434|20110124142324.295|TR0|Palestine to Muslims. This is 
20110124142324.295|20110124142326.155|TR0|pretty shocking.
20110124142326.155|20110124142328.016|TR0|
20110124142328.016|20110124142329.877|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And the other 
20110124142329.877|20110124142331.737|TR0|report that we have just heard, 
20110124142331.737|20110124142333.598|TR0|the Israeli government being 
20110124142333.598|20110124142335.459|TR0|cleared in the attack on the 
20110124142335.459|20110124142337.319|TR0|Mavi Marmara, the Gaza aid 
20110124142337.319|20110124142339.180|TR0|flotilla, last May 31st, 
20110124142339.180|20110124142341.040|TR0|Professor Khalidi?
20110124142341.040|20110124142342.901|TR0|
20110124142342.901|20110124142344.762|TR0|>> RASHID KHALIDI: Well, I mean, 
20110124142344.762|20110124142346.622|TR0|this is entirely expected. An 
20110124142346.622|20110124142348.483|TR0|Israeli government-appointed 
20110124142348.483|20110124142350.343|TR0|commission, rather than an 
20110124142350.343|20110124142352.204|TR0|international commission, a 
20110124142352.204|20110124142354.065|TR0|dependent commission appointed 
20110124142354.065|20110124142355.925|TR0|by the government, rather than 
20110124142355.925|20110124142357.786|TR0|independent of the Israeli 
20110124142357.786|20110124142359.646|TR0|government, has come to a 
20110124142359.646|20110124142401.507|TR0|conclusion white-washing the 
20110124142401.507|20110124142403.368|TR0|government that appointed it. I 
20110124142403.368|20110124142405.228|TR0|don't see why anybody should be 
20110124142405.228|20110124142407.089|TR0|surprised. It essentially hewed 
20110124142407.089|20110124142408.950|TR0|to exactly the lines of the 
20110124142408.950|20110124142410.810|TR0|Israeli propaganda offensive 
20110124142410.810|20110124142412.671|TR0|that was launched the very day 
20110124142412.671|20110124142414.531|TR0|that this ship was attacked, 
20110124142414.531|20110124142416.392|TR0|which argued that the blockade 
20110124142416.392|20110124142418.253|TR0|of essential supplies from Gaza, 
20110124142418.253|20110124142420.113|TR0|which is a violation of 
20110124142420.113|20110124142421.974|TR0|international humanitarian law, 
20110124142421.974|20110124142423.834|TR0|is legal, that everything that 
20110124142423.834|20110124142425.695|TR0|the Israeli forces that attacked 
20110124142425.695|20110124142427.556|TR0|this ship did, including killing 
20110124142427.556|20110124142429.416|TR0|nine Turkish, including one 
20110124142429.416|20110124142431.277|TR0|Turkish American, citizens was 
20110124142431.277|20110124142433.137|TR0|legal. Essentially, this thing 
20110124142433.137|20110124142434.998|TR0|was written, or could have been 
20110124142434.998|20110124142436.859|TR0|written, insofar as what we've 
20110124142436.859|20110124142438.719|TR0|seen so far of it, by the same 
20110124142438.719|20110124142440.580|TR0|people who are in charge of 
20110124142440.580|20110124142442.441|TR0|Israeli spin management. It's 
20110124142442.441|20110124142444.301|TR0|taken them a number of months to 
20110124142444.301|20110124142446.162|TR0|produce it, but the Israeli 
20110124142446.162|20110124142448.022|TR0|government spokesmen could 
20110124142448.022|20110124142449.883|TR0|easily have written this. Almost 
20110124142449.883|20110124142451.744|TR0|every key argument in this 
20110124142451.744|20110124142453.604|TR0|commission report was put 
20110124142453.604|20110124142455.465|TR0|forward by the Israeli 
20110124142455.465|20110124142457.325|TR0|government spokesmen at the 
20110124142457.325|20110124142459.186|TR0|outset of this affair.

20110124142754.084|20110124142755.944|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: It's found in

20110124142825.714|20110124142827.575|TR0|the movement. So, you would have 
20110124142827.575|20110124142829.435|TR0|an interview, a young sister at

20110124142833.156|20110124142835.017|TR0|revolution, you know, or you 
20110124142835.017|20110124142836.878|TR0|would have a free breakfast for 
20110124142836.878|20110124142838.738|TR0|children program, or you have 
20110124142838.738|20110124142840.599|TR0|all this rare footage of Bobby 
20110124142840.599|20110124142842.459|TR0|Seale's in somewhere in Europe. 
20110124142842.459|20110124142844.320|TR0|So, this is what this is about. 
20110124142844.320|20110124142846.181|TR0|So it's a compilation of all

20110124142902.926|20110124142904.787|TR0|>> STOKELY CARMICHAEL: Now, let 
20110124142904.787|20110124142906.647|TR0|us begin with the modern period 
20110124142906.647|20110124142908.508|TR0|of - I guess we could start with 
20110124142908.508|20110124142910.369|TR0|1956. For our generation, this 
20110124142910.369|20110124142912.229|TR0|was the beginning of the rise of 
20110124142912.229|20110124142914.090|TR0|Dr. Martin Luther King. Dr. King 
20110124142914.090|20110124142915.950|TR0|decided that in Montgomery, 
20110124142915.950|20110124142917.811|TR0|Alabama, black people had to pay 
20110124142917.811|20110124142919.672|TR0|the same prices on the buses as 
20110124142919.672|20110124142921.532|TR0|did white people, but we had to 
20110124142921.532|20110124142923.393|TR0|sit in the back. And we could 
20110124142923.393|20110124142925.254|TR0|only sit in the back if every 
20110124142925.254|20110124142927.114|TR0|available seat was taken by a 
20110124142927.114|20110124142928.975|TR0|white person. If a white person 
20110124142928.975|20110124142930.835|TR0|was standing, a black person 
20110124142930.835|20110124142932.696|TR0|could not sit. So Dr. King and 
20110124142932.696|20110124142934.557|TR0|his associates got together and 
20110124142934.557|20110124142936.417|TR0|said, "This is inhuman. We will 
20110124142936.417|20110124142938.278|TR0|boycott your bus system."
20110124142938.278|20110124142940.138|TR0|
20110124142940.138|20110124142941.999|TR0|Now, understand what a boycott 
20110124142941.999|20110124142943.860|TR0|is. A boycott is a passive act. 
20110124142943.860|20110124142945.720|TR0|It is the most passive political 
20110124142945.720|20110124142947.581|TR0|act that anyone can commit, a 
20110124142947.581|20110124142949.442|TR0|boycott, because what the 
20110124142949.442|20110124142951.302|TR0|boycott was doing was simply 
20110124142951.302|20110124142953.163|TR0|saying, "We will not ride your 
20110124142953.163|20110124142955.023|TR0|buses." No sort of antagonism. 
20110124142955.023|20110124142956.884|TR0|It was not even verbally 
20110124142956.884|20110124142958.745|TR0|violent. It was peaceful. Dr. 
20110124142958.745|20110124143000.605|TR0|King's policy was that 
20110124143000.605|20110124143002.466|TR0|nonviolence would achieve the

20110124143004.326|20110124143006.187|TR0|United States. His major 
20110124143006.187|20110124143008.048|TR0|assumption was that if you are 
20110124143008.048|20110124143009.908|TR0|nonviolent, if you suffer, your 
20110124143009.908|20110124143011.769|TR0|opponent will see your suffering 
20110124143011.769|20110124143013.629|TR0|and will be moved to change his 
20110124143013.629|20110124143015.490|TR0|heart. That's very good. He only 
20110124143015.490|20110124143017.351|TR0|made one fallacious assumption: 
20110124143017.351|20110124143019.211|TR0|in order for nonviolence to 
20110124143019.211|20110124143021.072|TR0|work, your opponent must have a 
20110124143021.072|20110124143022.933|TR0|conscience. The United States 
20110124143022.933|20110124143024.793|TR0|has none, has none.

20110124143054.563|20110124143056.424|TR0|about, well, perhaps the

20110124143107.587|20110124143109.448|TR0|the importance of action.
20110124143109.448|20110124143111.308|TR0|
20110124143111.308|20110124143113.169|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: Yes, yeah. 
20110124143113.169|20110124143115.030|TR0|Well, one of the things that, I 
20110124143115.030|20110124143116.890|TR0|mean, as you - it's very 
20110124143116.890|20110124143118.751|TR0|interesting. As we're talking 
20110124143118.751|20110124143120.612|TR0|about 1967, so much has happened 
20110124143120.612|20110124143122.472|TR0|within the last four years, 
20110124143122.472|20110124143124.333|TR0|since the passage of the Voters 
20110124143124.333|20110124143126.193|TR0|Rights Act - the riots in Watts, 
20110124143126.193|20110124143128.054|TR0|the riots in Detroit, the riots 
20110124143128.054|20110124143129.915|TR0|in Newark. And here's Stokely 
20110124143129.915|20110124143131.775|TR0|Carmichael. It so happens that I 
20110124143131.775|20110124143133.636|TR0|first met Stokely Carmichael in 
20110124143133.636|20110124143135.496|TR0|1967, when I was a student at 
20110124143135.496|20110124143137.357|TR0|San Francisco State. And San 
20110124143137.357|20110124143139.218|TR0|Francisco State was very unique 
20110124143139.218|20110124143141.078|TR0|in the sense that a number of 
20110124143141.078|20110124143142.939|TR0|the members of SNCC, who now 
20110124143142.939|20110124143144.799|TR0|decided were going back to 
20110124143144.799|20110124143146.660|TR0|school, came to San Francisco 
20110124143146.660|20110124143148.521|TR0|and resettled in San Francisco. 
20110124143148.521|20110124143150.381|TR0|So Stokely, Ralph Featherston, 
20110124143150.381|20110124143152.242|TR0|H. Rap Brown were out at San 
20110124143152.242|20110124143154.103|TR0|Francisco State on a regular 
20110124143154.103|20110124143155.963|TR0|basis. And so, to hear him talk 
20110124143155.963|20110124143157.824|TR0|about, really, what was in 1967 
20110124143157.824|20110124143159.684|TR0|the beginning of his own 
20110124143159.684|20110124143201.545|TR0|transition and his own movement 
20110124143201.545|20110124143203.406|TR0|from, certainly, the nonviolence 
20110124143203.406|20110124143205.266|TR0|- we had had the split in SNCC 
20110124143205.266|20110124143207.127|TR0|by that time. There were - we 
20110124143207.127|20110124143208.987|TR0|had the removal of white members 
20110124143208.987|20110124143210.848|TR0|of SNCC. And all those things 
20110124143210.848|20110124143212.709|TR0|were happening at this 
20110124143212.709|20110124143214.569|TR0|particular time.
20110124143214.569|20110124143216.430|TR0|
20110124143216.430|20110124143218.290|TR0|And he began to announce his new 
20110124143218.290|20110124143220.151|TR0|path, certainly respectful of 
20110124143220.151|20110124143222.012|TR0|King - and I say respectful of 
20110124143222.012|20110124143223.872|TR0|King, very respectful of King, 
20110124143223.872|20110124143225.733|TR0|as they all were. You know, 
20110124143225.733|20110124143227.594|TR0|remember, it was King and Harry 
20110124143227.594|20110124143229.454|TR0|Belafonte who initiated the 
20110124143229.454|20110124143231.315|TR0|Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
20110124143231.315|20110124143233.175|TR0|Committee, put up the resources 
20110124143233.175|20110124143235.036|TR0|for the Student Nonviolent 
20110124143235.036|20110124143236.897|TR0|Coordinating Committee, and, not 
20110124143236.897|20110124143238.757|TR0|only that, gave it life. So here 
20110124143238.757|20110124143240.618|TR0|he is. Here's the prodigal son 
20110124143240.618|20110124143242.478|TR0|breaking away at this particular 
20110124143242.478|20110124143244.339|TR0|moment. And certainly, King had 
20110124143244.339|20110124143246.200|TR0|been to Sweden. King had 
20110124143246.200|20110124143248.060|TR0|traveled to Scandinavian 
20110124143248.060|20110124143249.921|TR0|countries to raise money for the 
20110124143249.921|20110124143251.781|TR0|movement, which is something 
20110124143251.781|20110124143253.642|TR0|that Harry prompted him to do, 
20110124143253.642|20110124143255.503|TR0|as well - Harry Belafonte 
20110124143255.503|20110124143257.363|TR0|prompted him to do.
20110124143257.363|20110124143259.224|TR0|
20110124143259.224|20110124143301.085|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And, you know, 
20110124143301.085|20110124143302.945|TR0|of course, Dr. King had won the 
20110124143302.945|20110124143304.806|TR0|Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, but 
20110124143304.806|20110124143306.666|TR0|the footage in Black Power 
20110124143306.666|20110124143308.527|TR0|Mixtape of Dr. King, the king of 
20110124143308.527|20110124143310.388|TR0|Sweden raising money for him, 
20110124143310.388|20110124143312.248|TR0|and Harry Belafonte in Sweden 
20110124143312.248|20110124143314.109|TR0|together.
20110124143314.109|20110124143315.969|TR0|
20110124143315.969|20110124143317.830|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: Yes, yes. It's 
20110124143317.830|20110124143319.691|TR0|quite remarkable, because it was 
20110124143319.691|20110124143321.551|TR0|Harry's suggestion that they go 
20110124143321.551|20110124143323.412|TR0|to Sweden to raise money. Harry, 
20110124143323.412|20110124143325.273|TR0|certainly when he first met King 
20110124143325.273|20110124143327.133|TR0|in - I believe it was 1956, 1957 
20110124143327.133|20110124143328.994|TR0|- Harry, one of the most popular 
20110124143328.994|20110124143330.854|TR0|artists in the world at the 
20110124143330.854|20110124143332.715|TR0|particular time, was going to 
20110124143332.715|20110124143334.576|TR0|use his influence at the service 
20110124143334.576|20110124143336.436|TR0|- in the service of Dr. King, 
20110124143336.436|20110124143338.297|TR0|and so - and certainly had very 
20110124143338.297|20110124143340.157|TR0|strong connections with Sweden 
20110124143340.157|20110124143342.018|TR0|and other Scandinavian 
20110124143342.018|20110124143343.879|TR0|countries, as well. So, you hear 
20110124143343.879|20110124143345.739|TR0|- this is an incredible moment, 
20110124143345.739|20110124143347.600|TR0|you know, and this is something 
20110124143347.600|20110124143349.460|TR0|that people don't know about 
20110124143349.460|20110124143351.321|TR0|often, you know?
20110124143351.321|20110124143353.182|TR0|
20110124143353.182|20110124143355.042|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And now you, at 
20110124143355.042|20110124143356.903|TR0|this time, as you said, San 
20110124143356.903|20110124143358.764|TR0|Francisco State - people have 
20110124143358.764|20110124143400.624|TR0|heard a lot about Columbia and 
20110124143400.624|20110124143402.485|TR0|the student strikes, but the 
20110124143402.485|20110124143404.345|TR0|first big shutdown of a 
20110124143404.345|20110124143406.206|TR0|university is your own, and you 
20110124143406.206|20110124143408.067|TR0|were one of the leaders of it.
20110124143408.067|20110124143409.927|TR0|
20110124143409.927|20110124143411.788|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: Well, yes, San 
20110124143411.788|20110124143413.648|TR0|Francisco State, 1968. And part 
20110124143413.648|20110124143415.509|TR0|of this was - we were all moving 
20110124143415.509|20110124143417.370|TR0|in some sort of way. The BSU, 
20110124143417.370|20110124143419.230|TR0|when I can to San Francisco 
20110124143419.230|20110124143421.091|TR0|State in 1966, it was beginning 
20110124143421.091|20110124143422.951|TR0|to make its own transition, you 
20110124143422.951|20110124143424.812|TR0|know. And why this film was 
20110124143424.812|20110124143426.673|TR0|important for me was the fact 
20110124143426.673|20110124143428.533|TR0|that it is also my moment, my 
20110124143428.533|20110124143430.394|TR0|transition, as well. I had been 
20110124143430.394|20110124143432.255|TR0|raised - had been born and 
20110124143432.255|20110124143434.115|TR0|raised through the civil rights 
20110124143434.115|20110124143435.976|TR0|movement, and now, as the Black 
20110124143435.976|20110124143437.836|TR0|Power movement emerged, we begin 
20110124143437.836|20110124143439.697|TR0|to assume that  --  in fact, we 
20110124143439.697|20110124143441.558|TR0|had invited Amiri Baraka out to 
20110124143441.558|20110124143443.418|TR0|San Francisco State in the 
20110124143443.418|20110124143445.279|TR0|spring of 1967. So, San 
20110124143445.279|20110124143447.139|TR0|Francisco State  --
20110124143447.139|20110124143449.000|TR0|

20110124143458.303|20110124143500.164|TR0|becoming the Black Art movement, 
20110124143500.164|20110124143502.024|TR0|as well. So here we have the 
20110124143502.024|20110124143503.885|TR0|Black Power movement, as we 
20110124143503.885|20110124143505.746|TR0|identified by Stokely and the 
20110124143505.746|20110124143507.606|TR0|Black Panther Party, etc., and 
20110124143507.606|20110124143509.467|TR0|you had students who were 
20110124143509.467|20110124143511.327|TR0|involved, as well, myself and 
20110124143511.327|20110124143513.188|TR0|others. And the strike came out 
20110124143513.188|20110124143515.049|TR0|of that. The strike was an 
20110124143515.049|20110124143516.909|TR0|aggressive move by the Black 
20110124143516.909|20110124143518.770|TR0|Student Union. And we were 
20110124143518.770|20110124143520.630|TR0|fortunate to get allies in terms 
20110124143520.630|20110124143522.491|TR0|of the Asian Student Association 
20110124143522.491|20110124143524.352|TR0|and the Hispanic Student 
20110124143524.352|20110124143526.212|TR0|Association and also progressive 
20110124143526.212|20110124143528.073|TR0|white students, that made it 
20110124143528.073|20110124143529.934|TR0|successful.
20110124143529.934|20110124143531.794|TR0|
20110124143531.794|20110124143533.655|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You were 
20110124143533.655|20110124143535.515|TR0|fighting for Black Studies at 
20110124143535.515|20110124143537.376|TR0|San Francisco State. Just 
20110124143537.376|20110124143539.237|TR0|recently in Tucson, right at the 
20110124143539.237|20110124143541.097|TR0|same time of the horrendous 
20110124143541.097|20110124143542.958|TR0|shooting, actually, a headline 
20110124143542.958|20110124143544.818|TR0|in the paper that day about how 
20110124143544.818|20110124143546.679|TR0|they were shutting down ethnic 
20110124143546.679|20110124143548.540|TR0|studies.
20110124143548.540|20110124143550.400|TR0|
20110124143550.400|20110124143552.261|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: They were 
20110124143552.261|20110124143554.121|TR0|shutting down the study, yeah. 
20110124143554.121|20110124143555.982|TR0|Well -
20110124143555.982|20110124143557.843|TR0|
20110124143557.843|20110124143559.703|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: But you guys 
20110124143559.703|20110124143601.564|TR0|really started the activism for 
20110124143601.564|20110124143603.425|TR0|it.
20110124143603.425|20110124143605.285|TR0|
20110124143605.285|20110124143607.146|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: We're still - 
20110124143607.146|20110124143609.006|TR0|it's 41 years old, the ethnic 
20110124143609.006|20110124143610.867|TR0|studies program. And what was 
20110124143610.867|20110124143612.728|TR0|unique, it's the first ethnic 
20110124143612.728|20110124143614.588|TR0|studies program and the only one 
20110124143614.588|20110124143616.449|TR0|in any major university in the 
20110124143616.449|20110124143618.309|TR0|country. But interesting enough, 
20110124143618.309|20110124143620.170|TR0|the first time that I saw Huey 
20110124143620.170|20110124143622.031|TR0|P. Newton and had any idea who 
20110124143622.031|20110124143623.891|TR0|the Black Panther Party was in 
20110124143623.891|20110124143625.752|TR0|1966, when he came to the Black 
20110124143625.752|20110124143627.612|TR0|House and was reading poetry at 
20110124143627.612|20110124143629.473|TR0|the Black House. Huey P. Newton 
20110124143629.473|20110124143631.334|TR0|- that's some footage we should 
20110124143631.334|20110124143633.194|TR0|have had - reading poetry at the 
20110124143633.194|20110124143635.055|TR0|Black House. And at the Black 
20110124143635.055|20110124143636.916|TR0|House, Ed Bullins lived. 
20110124143636.916|20110124143638.776|TR0|Eldridge Cleaver lived at the 
20110124143638.776|20110124143640.637|TR0|Black House. They were two 
20110124143640.637|20110124143642.497|TR0|people who lived at the Black 
20110124143642.497|20110124143644.358|TR0|House. So, there was - you could 
20110124143644.358|20110124143646.219|TR0|see this, and now we're looking 
20110124143646.219|20110124143648.079|TR0|- certainly looking back in 
20110124143648.079|20110124143649.940|TR0|retrospect, but you could see 
20110124143649.940|20110124143651.800|TR0|this emerging movement happening 
20110124143651.800|20110124143653.661|TR0|around, really, what I believe 
20110124143653.661|20110124143655.522|TR0|was extraordinary moments of, as 
20110124143655.522|20110124143657.382|TR0|I said before, redefining and 
20110124143657.382|20110124143659.243|TR0|reimagining democracy, 
20110124143659.243|20110124143701.103|TR0|organizing, using those skills. 
20110124143701.103|20110124143702.964|TR0|Stokely was an organizer. Those 
20110124143702.964|20110124143704.825|TR0|members of SNCC were organizing. 
20110124143704.825|20110124143706.685|TR0|So, the Black Power movement was 
20110124143706.685|20110124143708.546|TR0|about extending that whole sense 
20110124143708.546|20110124143710.407|TR0|of organizing and community 
20110124143710.407|20110124143712.267|TR0|organizing.
20110124143712.267|20110124143714.128|TR0|
20110124143714.128|20110124143715.988|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, Danny 
20110124143715.988|20110124143717.849|TR0|Glover, is President Obama - or 
20110124143717.849|20110124143719.710|TR0|was - a community organizer in 
20110124143719.710|20110124143721.570|TR0|the South Side of Chicago. But 
20110124143721.570|20110124143723.431|TR0|he's taken a very different path?
20110124143723.431|20110124143725.291|TR0|
20110124143725.291|20110124143727.152|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: Well, he made 
20110124143727.152|20110124143729.013|TR0|choices, certainly. And 
20110124143729.013|20110124143730.873|TR0|certainly, you know, I come out 
20110124143730.873|20110124143732.734|TR0|of community service and 
20110124143732.734|20110124143734.595|TR0|community development, as well. 
20110124143734.595|20110124143736.455|TR0|I worked for the Model Cities 
20110124143736.455|20110124143738.316|TR0|Program in the Office of 
20110124143738.316|20110124143740.176|TR0|Community Development in San 
20110124143740.176|20110124143742.037|TR0|Francisco.
20110124143742.037|20110124143743.898|TR0|
20110124143743.898|20110124143745.758|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You were a 
20110124143745.758|20110124143747.619|TR0|social worker?
20110124143747.619|20110124143749.479|TR0|
20110124143749.479|20110124143751.340|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: I was 
20110124143751.340|20110124143753.201|TR0|evaluations specialist and 
20110124143753.201|20110124143755.061|TR0|program manager in the Model 
20110124143755.061|20110124143756.922|TR0|Cities Program from 1972 to 
20110124143756.922|20110124143758.782|TR0|1978, and so - through 1977, 
20110124143758.782|20110124143800.643|TR0|rather. And certainly, if you 
20110124143800.643|20110124143802.504|TR0|were able to - and this was a 
20110124143802.504|20110124143804.364|TR0|very key moment, because this 
20110124143804.364|20110124143806.225|TR0|also - as I think about it right 
20110124143806.225|20110124143808.086|TR0|now, it also is along the same 
20110124143808.086|20110124143809.946|TR0|lines, that parallels what's 
20110124143809.946|20110124143811.807|TR0|happening in the film, that 
20110124143811.807|20110124143813.667|TR0|there was an extraordinary level 
20110124143813.667|20110124143815.528|TR0|of grassroots democracy 
20110124143815.528|20110124143817.389|TR0|happening in communities like 
20110124143817.389|20110124143819.249|TR0|the Mission District in San 
20110124143819.249|20110124143821.110|TR0|Francisco and the 
20110124143821.110|20110124143822.970|TR0|Bayview-Hunters Point district 
20110124143822.970|20110124143824.831|TR0|in San Francisco. It is 
20110124143824.831|20110124143826.692|TR0|extraordinary. And certainly, it 
20110124143826.692|20110124143828.552|TR0|was fueled, of course, by, I 
20110124143828.552|20110124143830.413|TR0|think, this sense of organizing 
20110124143830.413|20110124143832.273|TR0|that came out of the civil 
20110124143832.273|20110124143834.134|TR0|rights movement, and I think 
20110124143834.134|20110124143835.995|TR0|also was translated into the 
20110124143835.995|20110124143837.855|TR0|Black Power movement, this sense 
20110124143837.855|20110124143839.716|TR0|of organizing, this sense of 
20110124143839.716|20110124143841.577|TR0|empowerment that people could be 
20110124143841.577|20110124143843.437|TR0|the architects for change. And 
20110124143843.437|20110124143845.298|TR0|this was happening all over the 
20110124143845.298|20110124143847.158|TR0|country.
20110124143847.158|20110124143849.019|TR0|
20110124143849.019|20110124143850.880|TR0|So, when you look at The Black 
20110124143850.880|20110124143852.740|TR0|Power Mixtape, you're able to 
20110124143852.740|20110124143854.601|TR0|kind of reflect on a moment and 
20110124143854.601|20110124143856.461|TR0|understand that there are core 
20110124143856.461|20110124143858.322|TR0|values at that moment, you know. 
20110124143858.322|20110124143900.183|TR0|Yeah, I mean, it was James Brown 
20110124143900.183|20110124143902.043|TR0|who, at the same time, came out 
20110124143902.043|20110124143903.904|TR0|and said, "I'm black and I'm 
20110124143903.904|20110124143905.765|TR0|proud," at the same time. So, 
20110124143905.765|20110124143907.625|TR0|all these particular - this 
20110124143907.625|20110124143909.486|TR0|particular energy was happening. 
20110124143909.486|20110124143911.346|TR0|And certainly, for them to be 
20110124143911.346|20110124143913.207|TR0|able to capture this, be able to 
20110124143913.207|20110124143915.068|TR0|- the Swedes be able to capture 
20110124143915.068|20110124143916.928|TR0|it, and looking from the outside 
20110124143916.928|20110124143918.789|TR0|in, was a critical part of this. 
20110124143918.789|20110124143920.649|TR0|They were able to see this from 
20110124143920.649|20110124143922.510|TR0|the outside, and asked very - 
20110124143922.510|20110124143924.371|TR0|sometimes very innocent 
20110124143924.371|20110124143926.231|TR0|questions. That's certainly that 
20110124143926.231|20110124143928.092|TR0|interview - that response by 
20110124143928.092|20110124143929.952|TR0|Angela to violence was 
20110124143929.952|20110124143931.813|TR0|extraordinary.
20110124143931.813|20110124143933.674|TR0|
20110124143933.674|20110124143935.534|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Let's go to that 
20110124143935.534|20110124143937.395|TR0|clip.
20110124143937.395|20110124143939.256|TR0|
20110124143939.256|20110124143941.116|TR0|>> SWEDISH TV: Yeah, but the 
20110124143941.116|20110124143942.977|TR0|question is, how do you get 
20110124143942.977|20110124143944.837|TR0|there? Do you get there by 
20110124143944.837|20110124143946.698|TR0|confrontation, violence?
20110124143946.698|20110124143948.559|TR0|
20110124143948.559|20110124143950.419|TR0|>> ANGELA DAVIS: Oh, was that

20110124143957.862|20110124143959.722|TR0|>> ANGELA DAVIS: You ask me, you 
20110124143959.722|20110124144001.583|TR0|know, whether I approve of 
20110124144001.583|20110124144003.443|TR0|violence - I mean, that just 
20110124144003.443|20110124144005.304|TR0|doesn't make any sense at all - 
20110124144005.304|20110124144007.165|TR0|whether I approve of guns. I 
20110124144007.165|20110124144009.025|TR0|grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. 
20110124144009.025|20110124144010.886|TR0|Some very, very good friends of 
20110124144010.886|20110124144012.747|TR0|mine were killed by bombs, bombs 
20110124144012.747|20110124144014.607|TR0|that were planted by racists. I 
20110124144014.607|20110124144016.468|TR0|remember - from the time I was 
20110124144016.468|20110124144018.328|TR0|very small, I remember the 
20110124144018.328|20110124144020.189|TR0|sounds of bombs exploding across 
20110124144020.189|20110124144022.050|TR0|the street, our house shaking. I 
20110124144022.050|20110124144023.910|TR0|remember my father having to 
20110124144023.910|20110124144025.771|TR0|have guns at his disposal at all 
20110124144025.771|20110124144027.631|TR0|times because of the fact that, 
20110124144027.631|20110124144029.492|TR0|at any moment, someone - we 
20110124144029.492|20110124144031.353|TR0|might expect to be attacked. The 
20110124144031.353|20110124144033.213|TR0|man who was at that time in 
20110124144033.213|20110124144035.074|TR0|complete control of the city 
20110124144035.074|20110124144036.934|TR0|government - his name was Bull 
20110124144036.934|20110124144038.795|TR0|Connor - would often get on the 
20110124144038.795|20110124144040.656|TR0|radio and make statements like 
20110124144040.656|20110124144042.516|TR0|"Niggers have moved into a white 
20110124144042.516|20110124144044.377|TR0|neighborhood; we better expect 
20110124144044.377|20110124144046.238|TR0|some bloodshed tonight." And 
20110124144046.238|20110124144048.098|TR0|sure enough, there would be 
20110124144048.098|20110124144049.959|TR0|bloodshed.

20110124144051.819|20110124144053.680|TR0|After the four young girls who 
20110124144053.680|20110124144055.541|TR0|were - who lived very - one of 
20110124144055.541|20110124144057.401|TR0|them lived next door to me. I 
20110124144057.401|20110124144059.262|TR0|was very good friends with the 
20110124144059.262|20110124144101.122|TR0|sister of another one. My sister 
20110124144101.122|20110124144102.983|TR0|was very good friends with all 
20110124144102.983|20110124144104.844|TR0|three of them. My mother taught 
20110124144104.844|20110124144106.704|TR0|one of them in her class. My 
20110124144106.704|20110124144108.565|TR0|mother - in fact, when the 
20110124144108.565|20110124144110.426|TR0|bombing occurred, one of the 
20110124144110.426|20110124144112.286|TR0|mothers of one of the young 
20110124144112.286|20110124144114.147|TR0|girls called my mother and said, 
20110124144114.147|20110124144116.007|TR0|"Can you take me down to the 
20110124144116.007|20110124144117.868|TR0|church to pick up Carole? You 
20110124144117.868|20110124144119.729|TR0|know, we heard about the 
20110124144119.729|20110124144121.589|TR0|bombing, and I don't have my 
20110124144121.589|20110124144123.450|TR0|car." And they went down, and 
20110124144123.450|20110124144125.310|TR0|what did they find? They found 
20110124144125.310|20110124144127.171|TR0|limbs and heads strewn all over 
20110124144127.171|20110124144129.032|TR0|the place. And then, after that, 
20110124144129.032|20110124144130.892|TR0|in my neighborhood, all the men 
20110124144130.892|20110124144132.753|TR0|organized themselves into an 
20110124144132.753|20110124144134.613|TR0|armed patrol. They had to take 
20110124144134.613|20110124144136.474|TR0|their guns and patrol our 
20110124144136.474|20110124144138.335|TR0|community every night, because 
20110124144138.335|20110124144140.195|TR0|they did not want that to happen 
20110124144140.195|20110124144142.056|TR0|again. I mean, that's why when 
20110124144142.056|20110124144143.917|TR0|someone asks me about violence, 
20110124144143.917|20110124144145.777|TR0|I just - I just find it 
20110124144145.777|20110124144147.638|TR0|incredible, because what it 
20110124144147.638|20110124144149.498|TR0|means is that the person who's 
20110124144149.498|20110124144151.359|TR0|asking that question has 
20110124144151.359|20110124144153.220|TR0|absolutely no idea what black 
20110124144153.220|20110124144155.080|TR0|people have gone through, what 
20110124144155.080|20110124144156.941|TR0|black people have experienced in 
20110124144156.941|20110124144158.801|TR0|this country, since the time the 
20110124144158.801|20110124144200.662|TR0|first black person was kidnapped 
20110124144200.662|20110124144202.523|TR0|from the shores of Africa.

20110124144239.735|20110124144241.595|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: Well, it's very 
20110124144241.595|20110124144243.456|TR0|interesting, because - let's 
20110124144243.456|20110124144245.317|TR0|just go back just to step back 
20110124144245.317|20110124144247.177|TR0|and think about all these young 
20110124144247.177|20110124144249.038|TR0|students - the Bob Moseses, you 
20110124144249.038|20110124144250.899|TR0|know, the Fannie Lou Hamers, you 
20110124144250.899|20110124144252.759|TR0|know, the Diane Nashes and 
20110124144252.759|20110124144254.620|TR0|Stokely Carmichaels and all 
20110124144254.620|20110124144256.480|TR0|these. All these people had gone 
20110124144256.480|20110124144258.341|TR0|through extreme periods of 
20110124144258.341|20110124144300.202|TR0|violence in the South, from the 
20110124144300.202|20110124144302.062|TR0|integration of lunch counters to 
20110124144302.062|20110124144303.923|TR0|the burning and bombing of buses 
20110124144303.923|20110124144305.783|TR0|in the Freedom Rides, and even 
20110124144305.783|20110124144307.644|TR0|as they organized, had been 
20110124144307.644|20110124144309.505|TR0|beaten, jailed. I mean, it was 
20110124144309.505|20110124144311.365|TR0|not - it's not uncommon - and 
20110124144311.365|20110124144313.226|TR0|when we look at the murder of 
20110124144313.226|20110124144315.087|TR0|the three civil rights workers, 
20110124144315.087|20110124144316.947|TR0|Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney - 
20110124144316.947|20110124144318.808|TR0|they're all not uncommon to face 
20110124144318.808|20110124144320.668|TR0|extraordinary, extreme terrorism 
20110124144320.668|20110124144322.529|TR0|and violence, and to be able to 
20110124144322.529|20110124144324.390|TR0|kind of now, with that, as young 
20110124144324.390|20110124144326.250|TR0|people, assume another kind of 
20110124144326.250|20110124144328.111|TR0|position and understand violence 
20110124144328.111|20110124144329.971|TR0|in a different kind of way and 
20110124144329.971|20110124144331.832|TR0|reflect on that violence in a 
20110124144331.832|20110124144333.693|TR0|different kind of way.
20110124144333.693|20110124144335.553|TR0|

20110124144341.135|20110124144342.996|TR0|terrorist. It was terrorism. I 
20110124144342.996|20110124144344.856|TR0|went and talked with Bob Moses, 
20110124144344.856|20110124144346.717|TR0|and he said, "When you talk 
20110124144346.717|20110124144348.578|TR0|about terrorism, I experienced 
20110124144348.578|20110124144350.438|TR0|that. About the people that I 
20110124144350.438|20110124144352.299|TR0|work with in the South, trying 
20110124144352.299|20110124144354.159|TR0|to register them to vote, they 
20110124144354.159|20110124144356.020|TR0|experience terrorism on a daily 
20110124144356.020|20110124144357.881|TR0|basis, historic terrorism." So, 
20110124144357.881|20110124144359.741|TR0|when we kind of - when we think 
20110124144359.741|20110124144401.602|TR0|about that violence, that Angela 
20110124144401.602|20110124144403.462|TR0|so brilliantly points it out, 
20110124144403.462|20110124144405.323|TR0|you know, that those girls who 
20110124144405.323|20110124144407.184|TR0|died in that church were friends 
20110124144407.184|20110124144409.044|TR0|of hers, friends of her sisters, 
20110124144409.044|20110124144410.905|TR0|lived next door to her. Her 
20110124144410.905|20110124144412.765|TR0|mother was a teacher, one of

20110124144527.190|20110124144529.051|TR0|some way, there's the side that 
20110124144529.051|20110124144530.911|TR0|drove him to that act, with the 
20110124144530.911|20110124144532.772|TR0|kind of vitriol, the kind of 
20110124144532.772|20110124144534.632|TR0|nasty, just villainous violence 
20110124144534.632|20110124144536.493|TR0|that is happening. The violence

20110124144700.221|20110124144702.081|TR0|importance of independent films.
20110124144702.081|20110124144703.942|TR0|
20110124144703.942|20110124144705.802|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: I mean, this is 
20110124144705.802|20110124144707.663|TR0|one of the great - for me, after 
20110124144707.663|20110124144709.524|TR0|all the blockbusters and 
20110124144709.524|20110124144711.384|TR0|everything, this is really - 
20110124144711.384|20110124144713.245|TR0|this is one of the great 
20110124144713.245|20110124144715.105|TR0|moments, I believe, in my 
20110124144715.105|20110124144716.966|TR0|career, to be able to kind of 
20110124144716.966|20110124144718.827|TR0|support the independent film, 
20110124144718.827|20110124144720.687|TR0|independent thinking. And 
20110124144720.687|20110124144722.548|TR0|certainly, if you take the whole 
20110124144722.548|20110124144724.409|TR0|genre of independent film - and 
20110124144724.409|20110124144726.269|TR0|I use the word "genre," but if 
20110124144726.269|20110124144728.130|TR0|you take independent films, and 
20110124144728.130|20110124144729.990|TR0|they invariably have some 
20110124144729.990|20110124144731.851|TR0|influence on the industry 
20110124144731.851|20110124144733.712|TR0|anyway. Independent film is 
20110124144733.712|20110124144735.572|TR0|where the real work that actors 
20110124144735.572|20110124144737.433|TR0|get a chance to do, where 
20110124144737.433|20110124144739.293|TR0|documentary - and this is why 
20110124144739.293|20110124144741.154|TR0|Sundance is so brilliant, about 
20110124144741.154|20110124144743.015|TR0|documentary films, you know, and 
20110124144743.015|20110124144744.875|TR0|documentaries and everything. 
20110124144744.875|20110124144746.736|TR0|It's so brilliant with this work 
20110124144746.736|20110124144748.596|TR0|about that, supporting the idea 
20110124144748.596|20110124144750.457|TR0|of documentaries. And when it 
20110124144750.457|20110124144752.318|TR0|does that, documentaries are our 
20110124144752.318|20110124144754.178|TR0|place and our way of 
20110124144754.178|20110124144756.039|TR0|establishing our relationship to 
20110124144756.039|20110124144757.900|TR0|what is happening to us. You 
20110124144757.900|20110124144759.760|TR0|know, it's only where - it's 
20110124144759.760|20110124144801.621|TR0|only where there's some sort of 
20110124144801.621|20110124144803.481|TR0|context in which we can look at 
20110124144803.481|20110124144805.342|TR0|what is happening to us, have 
20110124144805.342|20110124144807.203|TR0|opinions on it, disagree with 
20110124144807.203|20110124144809.063|TR0|it, discuss it and have a 
20110124144809.063|20110124144810.924|TR0|discourse about it, and perhaps, 
20110124144810.924|20110124144812.784|TR0|whether the documentary is about 
20110124144812.784|20110124144814.645|TR0|climate, whether the documentary 
20110124144814.645|20110124144816.506|TR0|is about healthcare, whatever 
20110124144816.506|20110124144818.366|TR0|they are, perhaps have some 
20110124144818.366|20110124144820.227|TR0|chance of understanding what the 
20110124144820.227|20110124144822.087|TR0|core issues are.

20110124144825.809|20110124144827.669|TR0|film that you've co-produced, 
20110124144827.669|20110124144829.530|TR0|this film Black Power Mixtape, 
20110124144829.530|20110124144831.391|TR0|is about movements 40 years ago. 
20110124144831.391|20110124144833.251|TR0|And the question is - well, 
20110124144833.251|20110124144835.112|TR0|another of the people here, the 
20110124144835.112|20110124144836.972|TR0|big films here, is about Harry

20110124144844.415|20110124144846.275|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And he is here. 
20110124144846.275|20110124144848.136|TR0|And he is raising this question. 
20110124144848.136|20110124144849.997|TR0|He said that he feels like he 
20110124144849.997|20110124144851.857|TR0|has failed now, as he looks 
20110124144851.857|20110124144853.718|TR0|back, whether there will be a 
20110124144853.718|20110124144855.579|TR0|new generation of activists 
20110124144855.579|20110124144857.439|TR0|following what has been 
20110124144857.439|20110124144859.300|TR0|accomplished over the decades, 
20110124144859.300|20110124144901.160|TR0|as he walked with King and his 
20110124144901.160|20110124144903.021|TR0|activism, aside from his 
20110124144903.021|20110124144904.882|TR0|artistry and his music. How do 
20110124144904.882|20110124144906.742|TR0|you feel about that?
20110124144906.742|20110124144908.603|TR0|
20110124144908.603|20110124144910.463|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: I don't sense 
20110124144910.463|20110124144912.324|TR0|that we - of course, we have a 
20110124144912.324|20110124144914.185|TR0|20-year span in our age, and I 
20110124144914.185|20110124144916.045|TR0|don't think - and there's so 
20110124144916.045|20110124144917.906|TR0|much work still that has to be 
20110124144917.906|20110124144919.766|TR0|done. But I have no sense of 
20110124144919.766|20110124144921.627|TR0|failure. I'm an eternal 
20110124144921.627|20110124144923.488|TR0|optimist, as well, you know, and 
20110124144923.488|20110124144925.348|TR0|I believe that, as Paul Robeson 
20110124144925.348|20110124144927.209|TR0|said, each generation makes its 
20110124144927.209|20110124144929.070|TR0|own history. They make their own 
20110124144929.070|20110124144930.930|TR0|history. And I think that this 
20110124144930.930|20110124144932.791|TR0|generation, that now it's going 
20110124144932.791|20110124144934.651|TR0|to make their history. They're 
20110124144934.651|20110124144936.512|TR0|going to have to respond to the 
20110124144936.512|20110124144938.373|TR0|crisis, whether it's the climate 
20110124144938.373|20110124144940.233|TR0|crisis or whether it's the 
20110124144940.233|20110124144942.094|TR0|financial crisis, the crisis of 
20110124144942.094|20110124144943.954|TR0|poverty in the world, the crisis 
20110124144943.954|20110124144945.815|TR0|of the inequity in the world. 
20110124144945.815|20110124144947.676|TR0|They're going to have to deal 
20110124144947.676|20110124144949.536|TR0|with that, you know? And they're 
20110124144949.536|20110124144951.397|TR0|going to have to listen outside 
20110124144951.397|20110124144953.257|TR0|of the framework and the 
20110124144953.257|20110124144955.118|TR0|constructs that they often have 
20110124144955.118|20110124144956.979|TR0|- have really dictated their 
20110124144956.979|20110124144958.839|TR0|lives or structured their lives 
20110124144958.839|20110124145000.700|TR0|and everything. They're going to 
20110124145000.700|20110124145002.561|TR0|have to do that.
20110124145002.561|20110124145004.421|TR0|
20110124145004.421|20110124145006.282|TR0|And understand that we can be 
20110124145006.282|20110124145008.142|TR0|here forcing that issue, talking 
20110124145008.142|20110124145010.003|TR0|about that and talking about - 
20110124145010.003|20110124145011.864|TR0|the question is, is that, if 
20110124145011.864|20110124145013.724|TR0|we're going to talk about 
20110124145013.724|20110124145015.585|TR0|democracy, what is democracy? 
20110124145015.585|20110124145017.445|TR0|And as I said the other night, 
20110124145017.445|20110124145019.306|TR0|whose democracy does it belong 
20110124145019.306|20110124145021.167|TR0|to? You know? And that's the 
20110124145021.167|20110124145023.027|TR0|fundamental question here. And 
20110124145023.027|20110124145024.888|TR0|once we begin to tackle that and 
20110124145024.888|20110124145026.748|TR0|struggle against that, we have a 
20110124145026.748|20110124145028.609|TR0|chance, you know, because the 
20110124145028.609|20110124145030.470|TR0|powers, the powers that be, are 
20110124145030.470|20110124145032.330|TR0|going to find every way to 
20110124145032.330|20110124145034.191|TR0|undermine it, to subvert it, to 
20110124145034.191|20110124145036.052|TR0|stop our voices, to cut off our 
20110124145036.052|20110124145037.912|TR0|resources, and find out a way 
20110124145037.912|20110124145039.773|TR0|they can do that. But the 
20110124145039.773|20110124145041.633|TR0|question is that we have to 
20110124145041.633|20110124145043.494|TR0|believe that we can do this and 
20110124145043.494|20110124145045.355|TR0|continue to do this.

20110124145047.215|20110124145049.076|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Before we end, I 
20110124145049.076|20110124145050.936|TR0|want to talk about one of the 
20110124145050.936|20110124145052.797|TR0|great crises of today, and it's 
20110124145052.797|20110124145054.658|TR0|Haiti, a country that is very 
20110124145054.658|20110124145056.518|TR0|close to your heart. You've been 
20110124145056.518|20110124145058.379|TR0|making a movie about Haiti for a 
20110124145058.379|20110124145100.240|TR0|long time. You visited President 
20110124145100.240|20110124145102.100|TR0|Aristide last February in South 
20110124145102.100|20110124145103.961|TR0|Africa, who was forced out. We 
20110124145103.961|20110124145105.821|TR0|have seen the horrendous 
20110124145105.821|20110124145107.682|TR0|earthquake and the effects of 
20110124145107.682|20110124145109.543|TR0|that - over 300,000 people 
20110124145109.543|20110124145111.403|TR0|killed, a million displaced, now

20110124145122.567|20110124145124.427|TR0|responsible for the deaths of I

20110124145159.779|20110124145201.640|TR0|painful. You know, I, like 
20110124145201.640|20110124145203.500|TR0|Frederick Douglass, often refer 
20110124145203.500|20110124145205.361|TR0|to myself as a Haitian at heart. 
20110124145205.361|20110124145207.222|TR0|And it's unacceptable that

20110124145209.082|20110124145210.943|TR0|with his people. It's 
20110124145210.943|20110124145212.803|TR0|unacceptable that the State 
20110124145212.803|20110124145214.664|TR0|Department can say to us that

20110124145303.040|20110124145304.901|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: You know, this 
20110124145304.901|20110124145306.761|TR0|country, these people have been 
20110124145306.761|20110124145308.622|TR0|under siege for more than 200 
20110124145308.622|20110124145310.482|TR0|years. After the moment after 
20110124145310.482|20110124145312.343|TR0|its independence, it's been 
20110124145312.343|20110124145314.204|TR0|under siege. And let's not lie 
20110124145314.204|20110124145316.064|TR0|about it. In every way, in every 
20110124145316.064|20110124145317.925|TR0|administration from that time 
20110124145317.925|20110124145319.785|TR0|on, from Jefferson to Madison to 
20110124145319.785|20110124145321.646|TR0|Clinton to Bush - all of them - 
20110124145321.646|20110124145323.507|TR0|every single one of them has 
20110124145323.507|20110124145325.367|TR0|done something to undermine 
20110124145325.367|20110124145327.228|TR0|Haiti's ability to stand on its

20110124145330.949|20110124145332.810|TR0|Haiti is - these people are so 
20110124145332.810|20110124145334.670|TR0|resilient. They are incredible. 
20110124145334.670|20110124145336.531|TR0|They're organizing now. They're 
20110124145336.531|20110124145338.392|TR0|there organizing amidst this 
20110124145338.392|20110124145340.252|TR0|chaos. Amidst the cholera, in 
20110124145340.252|20110124145342.113|TR0|the midst of - in the midst of 
20110124145342.113|20110124145343.973|TR0|the earthquake, in the midst of 
20110124145343.973|20110124145345.834|TR0|the lack of functioning 
20110124145345.834|20110124145347.695|TR0|government, they are organizing. 
20110124145347.695|20110124145349.555|TR0|You know what I'm saying, that 
20110124145349.555|20110124145351.416|TR0|every single president, every 
20110124145351.416|20110124145353.276|TR0|single administration has been 
20110124145353.276|20110124145355.137|TR0|responsible for what's 
20110124145355.137|20110124145356.998|TR0|happening, and every one of 
20110124145356.998|20110124145358.858|TR0|them. Yet we don't know that. We 
20110124145358.858|20110124145400.719|TR0|don't know any of that. We don't 
20110124145400.719|20110124145402.579|TR0|have any of that information 
20110124145402.579|20110124145404.440|TR0|right now.
20110124145404.440|20110124145406.301|TR0|
20110124145406.301|20110124145408.161|TR0|But right now, you're going to 
20110124145408.161|20110124145410.022|TR0|tell me that he is the past, 
20110124145410.022|20110124145411.883|TR0|that he has no place and no 
20110124145411.883|20110124145413.743|TR0|future in Haiti, is 
20110124145413.743|20110124145415.604|TR0|unacceptable. It's unacceptable 
20110124145415.604|20110124145417.464|TR0|that "Baby Doc" has returned to 
20110124145417.464|20110124145419.325|TR0|Haiti. That's unacceptable. And 
20110124145419.325|20110124145421.186|TR0|we have to say that's 
20110124145421.186|20110124145423.046|TR0|unacceptable. It's unacceptable 
20110124145423.046|20110124145424.907|TR0|to sanction these flawed 
20110124145424.907|20110124145426.767|TR0|elections, as the United States 
20110124145426.767|20110124145428.628|TR0|continues to pressure various 
20110124145428.628|20110124145430.489|TR0|countries, pressure to OAS and 
20110124145430.489|20110124145432.349|TR0|pressure everyone in order to 
20110124145432.349|20110124145434.210|TR0|accept these - it's unacceptable.

20110124145436.071|20110124145437.931|TR0|And we have to - we're going to 
20110124145437.931|20110124145439.792|TR0|have to, wherever we find - 
20110124145439.792|20110124145441.652|TR0|they're standing up for 
20110124145441.652|20110124145443.513|TR0|themselves. When they knocked 
20110124145443.513|20110124145445.374|TR0|down the fences and refused to 
20110124145445.374|20110124145447.234|TR0|be denied the right to vote 
20110124145447.234|20110124145449.095|TR0|during an election of Preval, 
20110124145449.095|20110124145450.955|TR0|they made a statement. They want 
20110124145450.955|20110124145452.816|TR0|their country back. They want 
20110124145452.816|20110124145454.677|TR0|their sovereignty back. They 
20110124145454.677|20110124145456.537|TR0|want their independence back. 
20110124145456.537|20110124145458.398|TR0|That's what the Haitian people 
20110124145458.398|20110124145500.258|TR0|want. And this is speaking from 
20110124145500.258|20110124145502.119|TR0|a Haitian at heart.

20110124145503.980|20110124145505.840|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And what is it 
20110124145505.840|20110124145507.701|TR0|you think the U.S. finds so - 
20110124145507.701|20110124145509.562|TR0|why will the U.S. not allow 
20110124145509.562|20110124145511.422|TR0|Aristide to return? Why was the 
20110124145511.422|20110124145513.283|TR0|U.S. involved in the coup 
20110124145513.283|20110124145515.143|TR0|against him, 1991 to 1994?
20110124145515.143|20110124145517.004|TR0|
20110124145517.004|20110124145518.865|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: And the other 
20110124145518.865|20110124145520.725|TR0|coup in 2004.
20110124145520.725|20110124145522.586|TR0|
20110124145522.586|20110124145524.446|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And the coup in 
20110124145524.446|20110124145526.307|TR0|2004, where they sent him off to 
20110124145526.307|20110124145528.168|TR0|the Central African Republic 
20110124145528.168|20110124145530.028|TR0|into exile with his wife, 
20110124145530.028|20110124145531.889|TR0|Mildred Aristide, and then he 
20110124145531.889|20110124145533.749|TR0|ends up in exile in South 
20110124145533.749|20110124145535.610|TR0|Africa, continually saying he 
20110124145535.610|20110124145537.471|TR0|wants to return. What is it the 
20110124145537.471|20110124145539.331|TR0|U.S. has against this 
20110124145539.331|20110124145541.192|TR0|democratically elected leader of 
20110124145541.192|20110124145543.053|TR0|Haiti?
20110124145543.053|20110124145544.913|TR0|
20110124145544.913|20110124145546.774|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: Well, I don't 
20110124145546.774|20110124145548.634|TR0|know how - what respect the 
20110124145548.634|20110124145550.495|TR0|United States has for democracy, 
20110124145550.495|20110124145552.356|TR0|anyway, and for people's right 
20110124145552.356|20110124145554.216|TR0|for self-determination, anyway. 
20110124145554.216|20110124145556.077|TR0|I don't know really if they have 
20110124145556.077|20110124145557.937|TR0|that. I think it's part of an 
20110124145557.937|20110124145559.798|TR0|ideal, certainly. I mean, but it 
20110124145559.798|20110124145601.659|TR0|was part of an ideal - you know, 
20110124145601.659|20110124145603.519|TR0|we know our own history. It's 
20110124145603.519|20110124145605.380|TR0|part of ideal. The Bill of 
20110124145605.380|20110124145607.240|TR0|Rights came out of - not from 
20110124145607.240|20110124145609.101|TR0|the fathers of the republic; it 
20110124145609.101|20110124145610.962|TR0|came from people demanding 
20110124145610.962|20110124145612.822|TR0|something more than that piece 
20110124145612.822|20110124145614.683|TR0|of paper.
20110124145614.683|20110124145616.544|TR0|
20110124145616.544|20110124145618.404|TR0|So, yeah, what it is is that 
20110124145618.404|20110124145620.265|TR0|they must at every point in time 
20110124145620.265|20110124145622.125|TR0|undermine the possibilities of 
20110124145622.125|20110124145623.986|TR0|democracy in Haiti. And Aristide 
20110124145623.986|20110124145625.847|TR0|represents that. And now, you 
20110124145625.847|20110124145627.707|TR0|can say whatever you want about 
20110124145627.707|20110124145629.568|TR0|Aristide, the fact that he was 
20110124145629.568|20110124145631.428|TR0|elected - elected. But in every 
20110124145631.428|20110124145633.289|TR0|way, Haiti represents something 
20110124145633.289|20110124145635.150|TR0|to the hemisphere. Haiti 
20110124145635.150|20110124145637.010|TR0|becoming a true democracy, a 
20110124145637.010|20110124145638.871|TR0|functioning democracy, 
20110124145638.871|20110124145640.732|TR0|represents something beyond 
20110124145640.732|20110124145642.592|TR0|that. Every single country in 
20110124145642.592|20110124145644.453|TR0|that hemisphere counts - 
20110124145644.453|20110124145646.313|TR0|connects its relationship, its 
20110124145646.313|20110124145648.174|TR0|independence, its own sense of 
20110124145648.174|20110124145650.035|TR0|sovereignty, its own sense of 
20110124145650.035|20110124145651.895|TR0|nationhood, to Haiti.
20110124145651.895|20110124145653.756|TR0|
20110124145653.756|20110124145655.616|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I know you have 
20110124145655.616|20110124145657.477|TR0|to leave. We just have two 
20110124145657.477|20110124145659.338|TR0|minutes. But the power of film 
20110124145659.338|20110124145701.198|TR0|is the power of storytelling.
20110124145701.198|20110124145703.059|TR0|
20110124145703.059|20110124145704.919|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: Yes.
20110124145704.919|20110124145706.780|TR0|
20110124145706.780|20110124145708.641|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You have been 
20110124145708.641|20110124145710.501|TR0|focused on Haiti, in terms of 
20110124145710.501|20110124145712.362|TR0|film, by wanting to tell the 
20110124145712.362|20110124145714.223|TR0|story of Toussaint Louverture. 
20110124145714.223|20110124145716.083|TR0|And as we wrap up, I was 
20110124145716.083|20110124145717.944|TR0|wondering if, in a nutshell, you 
20110124145717.944|20110124145719.804|TR0|could tell us that story and why 
20110124145719.804|20110124145721.665|TR0|it has grabbed you for so many 
20110124145721.665|20110124145723.526|TR0|years as a story you want to 
20110124145723.526|20110124145725.386|TR0|pass on to future generations.
20110124145725.386|20110124145727.247|TR0|
20110124145727.247|20110124145729.107|TR0|>> DANNY GLOVER: Well, it's my 
20110124145729.107|20110124145730.968|TR0|story. It's a story - Frederick 
20110124145730.968|20110124145732.829|TR0|Douglass said in 1893 at the 
20110124145732.829|20110124145734.689|TR0|Chicago Fair that we owe so much 
20110124145734.689|20110124145736.550|TR0|to Haiti. Jose Marti, the great 
20110124145736.550|20110124145738.410|TR0|Cuban revolutionary, said we owe 
20110124145738.410|20110124145740.271|TR0|so much to Haiti. We owe so much 
20110124145740.271|20110124145742.132|TR0|to Haiti, first of all. But it's 
20110124145742.132|20110124145743.992|TR0|an extraordinary story and the 
20110124145743.992|20110124145745.853|TR0|only story of its kind ever - 
20110124145745.853|20110124145747.714|TR0|ever - in the history of human - 
20110124145747.714|20110124145749.574|TR0|that we have written in written 
20110124145749.574|20110124145751.435|TR0|human history, that these slaves 
20110124145751.435|20110124145753.295|TR0|revolted and challenged the 
20110124145753.295|20110124145755.156|TR0|empire. At the outset of the 
20110124145755.156|20110124145757.017|TR0|translation, new translation, 
20110124145757.017|20110124145758.877|TR0|new construct of capitalism and 
20110124145758.877|20110124145800.738|TR0|liberal democracies, here is 
20110124145800.738|20110124145802.598|TR0|this country, this smaller 
20110124145802.598|20110124145804.459|TR0|country, these people, who at 
20110124145804.459|20110124145806.320|TR0|that particular point stand up 
20110124145806.320|20110124145808.180|TR0|and say, "It applies to us." 
20110124145808.180|20110124145810.041|TR0|That's what they said. "It 
20110124145810.041|20110124145811.901|TR0|applies to us." They were 
20110124145811.901|20110124145813.762|TR0|defining democracy in a 
20110124145813.762|20110124145815.623|TR0|different way than even the 
20110124145815.623|20110124145817.483|TR0|fathers of democracy in this 
20110124145817.483|20110124145819.344|TR0|country were, even the fathers 
20110124145819.344|20110124145821.205|TR0|of the Rights of Man in France 
20110124145821.205|20110124145823.065|TR0|were. They were defining 
20110124145823.065|20110124145824.926|TR0|democracy. That's what makes it 
20110124145824.926|20110124145826.786|TR0|special. It challenges us. 
20110124145826.786|20110124145828.647|TR0|Struggle never concedes upon 
20110124145828.647|20110124145830.508|TR0|demand - Frederick Douglass. And 
20110124145830.508|20110124145832.368|TR0|that struggle, whatever it was - 
20110124145832.368|20110124145834.229|TR0|the demand for independence, 
20110124145834.229|20110124145836.089|TR0|demand for sovereignty - is 
20110124145836.089|20110124145837.950|TR0|still within the Haitian 
20110124145837.950|20110124145839.811|TR0|people's heart.
