20110124030007.000|20110124030009.000|TR0|DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  Right now, 
20110124030009.000|20110124030012.000|TR0|everything you need to know for your week 
20110124030012.000|20110124030014.000|TR0|ahead including the latest twist in the 
20110124030014.000|20110124030017.000|TR0|investigation of a woman accused of 
20110124030017.000|20110124030020.000|TR0|kidnapping a baby from a hospital more 
20110124030020.000|20110124030022.000|TR0|than 20 years ago.  Police now have her in 
20110124030022.000|20110124030025.000|TR0|custody, and we're talking to them about 
20110124030025.000|20110124030027.000|TR0|how she was caught and why she did it.
20110124030027.000|20110124030030.000|TR0|
20110124030030.000|20110124030033.000|TR0|A woman shopping at Wal-Mart is killed 
20110124030033.000|20110124030035.000|TR0|during a shoot-out between a gunman and 
20110124030035.000|20110124030038.000|TR0|police.  The gunman is also dead.  What 
20110124030038.000|20110124030040.000|TR0|set off the barrage of bullets today at 
20110124030040.000|20110124030043.000|TR0|America's largest retailer?
20110124030043.000|20110124030046.000|TR0|
20110124030046.000|20110124030048.000|TR0|And this woman says she knows what 
20110124030048.000|20110124030051.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords is facing now and will 
20110124030051.000|20110124030053.000|TR0|in the future.  Mary Jo Buttafuoco was 
20110124030053.000|20110124030056.000|TR0|shot in the head at close range by her 
20110124030056.000|20110124030059.000|TR0|husband's teenaged lover almost 20 years 
20110124030059.000|20110124030101.000|TR0|ago.  In a rare TV appearance, she shares 
20110124030101.000|20110124030104.000|TR0|her incredible battle back to health right 
20110124030104.000|20110124030106.000|TR0|now.

20110124030109.000|20110124030112.000|TR0|Good evening, everyone.  I'm Don Lemon.
20110124030112.000|20110124030114.000|TR0|
20110124030114.000|20110124030117.000|TR0|Topping the news tonight, a Detroit police 
20110124030117.000|20110124030119.000|TR0|officer seriously wounded today in a 
20110124030119.000|20110124030122.000|TR0|shoot-out is out of surgery and is 
20110124030122.000|20110124030125.000|TR0|expected to survive.  In all, four 
20110124030125.000|20110124030127.000|TR0|officers were wounded when a gunman walked 
20110124030127.000|20110124030130.000|TR0|into the station precinct and opened fire. 
20110124030130.000|20110124030132.000|TR0| The gunman was killed as police returned 
20110124030132.000|20110124030135.000|TR0|fire.  Live report is just ahead.
20110124030135.000|20110124030138.000|TR0|
20110124030138.000|20110124030140.000|TR0|We're following another shooting involving 
20110124030140.000|20110124030143.000|TR0|law enforcement.  This one is in 
20110124030143.000|20110124030145.000|TR0|Washington State.  Investigators say two 
20110124030145.000|20110124030148.000|TR0|people were killed outside a Wal-Mart in 
20110124030148.000|20110124030151.000|TR0|Port Orchard.  One of them is a suspect 
20110124030151.000|20110124030153.000|TR0|and the other is an unidentified woman.  
20110124030153.000|20110124030156.000|TR0|Two deputies were also shot and 
20110124030156.000|20110124030158.000|TR0|transferred to Tacoma for treatment.  
20110124030158.000|20110124030201.000|TR0|Their injuries are not considered 
20110124030201.000|20110124030204.000|TR0|life-threatening.
20110124030204.000|20110124030206.000|TR0|
20110124030206.000|20110124030209.000|TR0|In Connecticut, federal kidnapping charges 
20110124030209.000|20110124030211.000|TR0|have been filed in the 1987 kidnapping of 
20110124030211.000|20110124030214.000|TR0|a baby girl from a New York hospital.  The 
20110124030214.000|20110124030217.000|TR0|FBI in Bridgeport, Connecticut says Ann 
20110124030217.000|20110124030219.000|TR0|Pettway turned herself in this morning.  
20110124030219.000|20110124030222.000|TR0|Pettway allegedly snatched the infant 23 
20110124030222.000|20110124030224.000|TR0|years ago and then raised the girl as her 
20110124030224.000|20110124030227.000|TR0|own daughter.  That girl, Carlina White, 
20110124030227.000|20110124030230.000|TR0|now 23 years old, recently discovered her 
20110124030230.000|20110124030232.000|TR0|true identity and was reunited last week 
20110124030232.000|20110124030235.000|TR0|with her biological family.  A report on 
20110124030235.000|20110124030237.000|TR0|the circumstances leading up to Pettway's 
20110124030237.000|20110124030240.000|TR0|surrender is also just ahead.
20110124030240.000|20110124030243.000|TR0|
20110124030243.000|20110124030245.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is still 
20110124030245.000|20110124030248.000|TR0|in intensive care in a Houston hospital 
20110124030248.000|20110124030251.000|TR0|tonight.  But doctors say she is 
20110124030251.000|20110124030253.000|TR0|surprising them with the progress she's 
20110124030253.000|20110124030256.000|TR0|already made.  Giffords was transferred 
20110124030256.000|20110124030258.000|TR0|from Arizona to Houston for rehabilitation 
20110124030258.000|20110124030301.000|TR0|work.  She is doing exercises that involve 
20110124030301.000|20110124030304.000|TR0|moving, sitting and standing.  Giffords 
20110124030304.000|20110124030306.000|TR0|still has a breathing tube in her neck and 
20110124030306.000|20110124030309.000|TR0|can't speak, but doctors say she is trying 
20110124030309.000|20110124030311.000|TR0|to communicate.
20110124030311.000|20110124030314.000|TR0|
20110124030314.000|20110124030317.000|TR0|Meantime, the man accused of shooting 
20110124030317.000|20110124030319.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords and 18 others will 
20110124030319.000|20110124030322.000|TR0|be in federal court tomorrow in Phoenix.  
20110124030322.000|20110124030324.000|TR0|Jared Loughner will be arraigned for the 
20110124030324.000|20110124030327.000|TR0|attempted assassination of Giffords and 
20110124030327.000|20110124030330.000|TR0|the attempted murder of two of her aides.  
20110124030330.000|20110124030332.000|TR0|He will probably face more indictments for 
20110124030332.000|20110124030335.000|TR0|the other victims in the future.  Six 
20110124030335.000|20110124030337.000|TR0|people were killed and 13 others wounded 
20110124030337.000|20110124030340.000|TR0|in a rampage in Tucson on January 8th.

20110124030343.000|20110124030345.000|TR0|President Barack Obama will head to 
20110124030345.000|20110124030348.000|TR0|Capitol Hill to address Congress and the 
20110124030348.000|20110124030350.000|TR0|nation in less than 48 hours.  He told 
20110124030350.000|20110124030353.000|TR0|supporters this weekend that Tuesday's 
20110124030353.000|20110124030356.000|TR0|State of the Union address will focus 
20110124030356.000|20110124030358.000|TR0|mainly on jobs and the economy.  Meantime, 
20110124030358.000|20110124030401.000|TR0|a White House official tells CNN that 
20110124030401.000|20110124030403.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords' husband, Captain Mark 
20110124030403.000|20110124030406.000|TR0|Kelly was invited to sit with Mrs. Obama 
20110124030406.000|20110124030409.000|TR0|during the speech but he is not expected 
20110124030409.000|20110124030411.000|TR0|to attend.
20110124030411.000|20110124030414.000|TR0|
20110124030414.000|20110124030416.000|TR0|Former Secretary of State Colin Powell 
20110124030416.000|20110124030419.000|TR0|told CNN's Candy Crowley today that he is 
20110124030419.000|20110124030422.000|TR0|not ready to endorse anyone in either 
20110124030422.000|20110124030424.000|TR0|party for president in 2012.  Powell 
20110124030424.000|20110124030427.000|TR0|crossed party lines and gave then Senator 
20110124030427.000|20110124030429.000|TR0|Barack Obama a big boost when he endorsed 
20110124030429.000|20110124030432.000|TR0|him back in 2008.  Next time, maybe not.

20110124030440.000|20110124030442.000|TR0|COLIN POWELL, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:  
20110124030442.000|20110124030445.000|TR0|So I'm not committed to Barack Obama.  I'm 
20110124030445.000|20110124030448.000|TR0|not committed to a Republican candidate.  
20110124030448.000|20110124030450.000|TR0|I will see who emerges.  Right now, I do 
20110124030450.000|20110124030453.000|TR0|not see on the Republican side any one 
20110124030453.000|20110124030455.000|TR0|individual who I think is going to emerge 
20110124030455.000|20110124030458.000|TR0|at the top of the pile.

20110124030506.000|20110124030508.000|TR0|LEMON:  Powell, of course, is a 
20110124030508.000|20110124030511.000|TR0|Republican.  He refused to grade President 
20110124030511.000|20110124030514.000|TR0|Obama's performance but he said, quote, 
20110124030514.000|20110124030516.000|TR0|"We didn't elect Superman, we elected a 
20110124030516.000|20110124030519.000|TR0|human being."

20110124030521.000|20110124030524.000|TR0|And speaking of presidential politics, 
20110124030524.000|20110124030527.000|TR0|Mitt Romney won this weekend's New 
20110124030527.000|20110124030529.000|TR0|Hampshire GOP presidential straw poll.  
20110124030529.000|20110124030532.000|TR0|It's not scientific, of course, but still 
20110124030532.000|20110124030535.000|TR0|it's very interesting.  Here it is.  He 
20110124030535.000|20110124030537.000|TR0|got 35 percent of the vote in a survey of 
20110124030537.000|20110124030540.000|TR0|state Republicans.  Congressman Ron Paul 
20110124030540.000|20110124030542.000|TR0|was second with 11 percent, former 
20110124030542.000|20110124030545.000|TR0|Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty was third 
20110124030545.000|20110124030548.000|TR0|with 8 percent.  Sarah Palin is a bit of a 
20110124030548.000|20110124030550.000|TR0|surprise here.  Only got 7 percent to 
20110124030550.000|20110124030553.000|TR0|finish fourth.
20110124030553.000|20110124030555.000|TR0|
20110124030555.000|20110124030558.000|TR0|The battle over repealing the new health 
20110124030558.000|20110124030601.000|TR0|care law is headed to the Senate, and top 
20110124030601.000|20110124030603.000|TR0|senators in both parties are vowing to 
20110124030603.000|20110124030606.000|TR0|stand their ground.  Republicans say they 
20110124030606.000|20110124030608.000|TR0|will push for a vote to repeal the entire 
20110124030608.000|20110124030611.000|TR0|law, but Majority Leader Harry Reid says 
20110124030611.000|20110124030614.000|TR0|that's not going to happen.  If repeal 
20110124030614.000|20110124030616.000|TR0|efforts fail, Republicans insist they will 
20110124030616.000|20110124030619.000|TR0|try to dismantle the law piece-by-piece.  
20110124030619.000|20110124030621.000|TR0|A vote to repeal has already passed the 
20110124030621.000|20110124030624.000|TR0|House.

20110124030627.000|20110124030629.000|TR0|For a week now, the world has been asking 
20110124030629.000|20110124030632.000|TR0|why former dictator Jean- Claude "Baby 
20110124030632.000|20110124030634.000|TR0|Doc" Duvalier has returned to Haiti.  Now, 
20110124030634.000|20110124030637.000|TR0|one of his lawyers may have provided the 
20110124030637.000|20110124030640.000|TR0|answer to CNN.  Attorney Ed Marger said 
20110124030640.000|20110124030642.000|TR0|he's trying to reclaim millions from a 
20110124030642.000|20110124030645.000|TR0|frozen bank account that belongs to a 
20110124030645.000|20110124030647.000|TR0|family foundation.  But Marger says 
20110124030647.000|20110124030650.000|TR0|Duvalier doesn't want it for himself.  He 
20110124030650.000|20110124030653.000|TR0|wants to use it to help rebuild Haiti 
20110124030653.000|20110124030655.000|TR0|after the devastating earthquake there.

20110124030729.000|20110124030732.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:   As CNN reported 
20110124030732.000|20110124030734.000|TR0|exclusively, the search for Ann Pettway is 
20110124030734.000|20110124030737.000|TR0|over.  The FBI tells CNN that Pettway 
20110124030737.000|20110124030739.000|TR0|turned herself in to the FBI on Sunday 
20110124030739.000|20110124030742.000|TR0|morning in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  A law 
20110124030742.000|20110124030745.000|TR0|enforcement source tells CNN that she 
20110124030745.000|20110124030747.000|TR0|contacted a Bridgeport, Connecticut police 
20110124030747.000|20110124030750.000|TR0|officer via Facebook on Sunday before 
20110124030750.000|20110124030752.000|TR0|turning herself in.
20110124030752.000|20110124030755.000|TR0|
20110124030755.000|20110124030758.000|TR0|Now, she is wanted for questioning in the 
20110124030758.000|20110124030800.000|TR0|baby snatching of a child back in 1987 
20110124030800.000|20110124030803.000|TR0|from a hospital in Harlem, New York.  She 
20110124030803.000|20110124030805.000|TR0|was picked up on a warrant out of North 
20110124030805.000|20110124030808.000|TR0|Carolina for violating a parole violation 
20110124030808.000|20110124030811.000|TR0|on embezzlement charges there.  She was 
20110124030811.000|20110124030813.000|TR0|not to leave the state without contacting 
20110124030813.000|20110124030816.000|TR0|the police.
20110124030816.000|20110124030819.000|TR0|
20110124030819.000|20110124030821.000|TR0|Now, Bridgeport police tell us that on 
20110124030821.000|20110124030824.000|TR0|Saturday, Pettway was sighted at this 
20110124030824.000|20110124030826.000|TR0|pawnshop.  She had gone inside to see how 
20110124030826.000|20110124030829.000|TR0|much she could pawn some jewelry, but she 
20110124030829.000|20110124030832.000|TR0|wasn't happy with the answer she got and 
20110124030832.000|20110124030834.000|TR0|she left alone on foot according to police.
20110124030834.000|20110124030837.000|TR0|
20110124030837.000|20110124030839.000|TR0|They were able to confirm that it was her 
20110124030839.000|20110124030842.000|TR0|by looking at the store's surveillance 
20110124030842.000|20110124030845.000|TR0|cameras.   She remains in custody while 
20110124030845.000|20110124030847.000|TR0|this investigation into the suspected baby

20110124031047.000|20110124031049.000|TR0|and two deputies were wounded.  And Tom

20110124031052.000|20110124031055.000|TR0|of the shooting inside a Detroit precinct 
20110124031055.000|20110124031057.000|TR0|which left four officers wounded.  Let's

20110124031103.000|20110124031105.000|TR0|Now, Tom, we understand the suspect is 
20110124031105.000|20110124031108.000|TR0|dead in this case as well.

20110124031110.000|20110124031113.000|TR0|TOM WAIT, WXYZ REPORTER:  That's correct, 
20110124031113.000|20110124031116.000|TR0|Don.   There were four officers shot as 
20110124031116.000|20110124031118.000|TR0|you said.  The suspect walked into the 
20110124031118.000|20110124031121.000|TR0|precinct just behind me here on Detroit's 
20110124031121.000|20110124031123.000|TR0|west side.  The man walked in, and they 
20110124031123.000|20110124031126.000|TR0|thought he was just an ordinary citizen 
20110124031126.000|20110124031129.000|TR0|until he walked into a hallway, took out a 
20110124031129.000|20110124031131.000|TR0|shotgun and opened fire.  He hit a female 
20110124031131.000|20110124031134.000|TR0|sergeant.  Then he went toward the front 
20110124031134.000|20110124031136.000|TR0|desk, where he shot at two other officers 
20110124031136.000|20110124031139.000|TR0|-- another sergeant and a patrol officer.
20110124031139.000|20110124031142.000|TR0|
20110124031142.000|20110124031144.000|TR0|A commander here at the precinct then 
20110124031144.000|20110124031147.000|TR0|grabbed one of the sergeant's guns and 
20110124031147.000|20110124031149.000|TR0|opened fire on the suspect.  But that 
20110124031149.000|20110124031152.000|TR0|suspect was able to shoot him first in the 
20110124031152.000|20110124031155.000|TR0|back and actually jumped the counter here 
20110124031155.000|20110124031157.000|TR0|in this precinct.  The gunfire kept going 
20110124031157.000|20110124031200.000|TR0|back and forth until finally the officers 
20110124031200.000|20110124031202.000|TR0|inside the precinct were able to gather 
20110124031202.000|20110124031205.000|TR0|themselves and shoot and kill him.  They 
20110124031205.000|20110124031208.000|TR0|believed this was going on during roll 
20110124031208.000|20110124031210.000|TR0|call so many officers were in the station.

20110124031228.000|20110124031231.000|TR0|LINDSEY COHEN, KOMO REPORTER:  Don, this 
20110124031231.000|20110124031234.000|TR0|began as a relatively ordinary Sunday 
20110124031234.000|20110124031236.000|TR0|afternoon in this small community about an 
20110124031236.000|20110124031239.000|TR0|hour outside Seattle.  What began as a 
20110124031239.000|20110124031241.000|TR0|relatively minor situation quickly 
20110124031241.000|20110124031244.000|TR0|escalated into gunfire.  Two people are 
20110124031244.000|20110124031247.000|TR0|dead, two deputies injured and the FBI has 
20110124031247.000|20110124031249.000|TR0|been called out to investigate.

20110124031252.000|20110124031254.000|TR0|This all began when someone called police 
20110124031254.000|20110124031257.000|TR0|to report what they believed was a 
20110124031257.000|20110124031300.000|TR0|suspicious person in and around this 
20110124031300.000|20110124031302.000|TR0|Wal-Mart in Port Orchard. Deputies 
20110124031302.000|20110124031305.000|TR0|responded.  We're told they made contact 
20110124031305.000|20110124031307.000|TR0|with the man just outside of the store.  
20110124031307.000|20110124031310.000|TR0|What happened next, we're not sure but 
20110124031310.000|20110124031313.000|TR0|that man took out a gun and started firing 
20110124031313.000|20110124031315.000|TR0|at deputies.  They shot back.  Four people 
20110124031315.000|20110124031318.000|TR0|were injured including two of the deputies 
20110124031318.000|20110124031320.000|TR0|who responded to the scene.  They have 
20110124031320.000|20110124031323.000|TR0|been taken to the hospital.  We're told 
20110124031323.000|20110124031326.000|TR0|their injuries are non-life-threatening.
20110124031326.000|20110124031328.000|TR0|
20110124031328.000|20110124031331.000|TR0|Meantime, two people are dead.  The 
20110124031331.000|20110124031333.000|TR0|suspect was killed here at the scene.  The 
20110124031333.000|20110124031336.000|TR0|second person described as a young woman, 
20110124031336.000|20110124031339.000|TR0|possibly as young as a teenager, she was 
20110124031339.000|20110124031341.000|TR0|taken to a nearby hospital where she was 
20110124031341.000|20110124031344.000|TR0|pronounced dead when she got there.  Right 
20110124031344.000|20110124031347.000|TR0|now, police aren't sure what her 
20110124031347.000|20110124031349.000|TR0|relationship is to the suspect.  This case 
20110124031349.000|20110124031352.000|TR0|has been handed over to the state patrol 
20110124031352.000|20110124031354.000|TR0|but will receive some help from the FBI. 
20110124031354.000|20110124031357.000|TR0|Interesting to note, Don, this community 
20110124031357.000|20110124031400.000|TR0|is about a half an hour away from 
20110124031400.000|20110124031402.000|TR0|Lakewood, Washington, where four police 
20110124031402.000|20110124031405.000|TR0|officers were shot and killed about 15 
20110124031405.000|20110124031407.000|TR0|months ago.  So, folks in this area are 
20110124031407.000|20110124031410.000|TR0|very sensitive when they hear that law 
20110124031410.000|20110124031413.000|TR0|enforcement officers are injured on the 
20110124031413.000|20110124031415.000|TR0|job.
20110124031415.000|20110124031418.000|TR0|
20110124031418.000|20110124031420.000|TR0|And Lindsey, as we know, Wal-Mart is 
20110124031420.000|20110124031423.000|TR0|America's number one top retailer.  
20110124031423.000|20110124031426.000|TR0|Describe to us the scene inside of the 
20110124031426.000|20110124031428.000|TR0|store.  What did witnesses say, people who 
20110124031428.000|20110124031431.000|TR0|were shopping there.
20110124031431.000|20110124031433.000|TR0|
20110124031433.000|20110124031436.000|TR0|COHEN:  Witnesses tell us that it was an 
20110124031436.000|20110124031439.000|TR0|average ordinary Sunday afternoon.  People 
20110124031439.000|20110124031441.000|TR0|going in, people coming out.  One man I 
20110124031441.000|20110124031444.000|TR0|spoke with was actually coming out of the 
20110124031444.000|20110124031446.000|TR0|store when he heard gunfire out of nowhere 
20110124031446.000|20110124031449.000|TR0|and then saw a man running towards a 
20110124031449.000|20110124031452.000|TR0|wooded area that is just next to this 
20110124031452.000|20110124031454.000|TR0|store.
20110124031454.000|20110124031457.000|TR0|
20110124031457.000|20110124031459.000|TR0|We're not really told that there was much 
20110124031459.000|20110124031502.000|TR0|of a commotion that brought out.  Because 
20110124031502.000|20110124031505.000|TR0|this area is somewhat rural, when people 
20110124031505.000|20110124031507.000|TR0|hear gunfire, it's not that unusual 
20110124031507.000|20110124031510.000|TR0|because there might be hunting going on 
20110124031510.000|20110124031512.000|TR0|nearby. But it was the rapid fire gunshots 
20110124031512.000|20110124031515.000|TR0|that told most folks nearby that something 
20110124031515.000|20110124031518.000|TR0|was wrong.
20110124031518.000|20110124031520.000|TR0|
20110124031520.000|20110124031523.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right.  Now back to Detroit.  
20110124031523.000|20110124031525.000|TR0|Tom, we heard the police chief earlier 
20110124031525.000|20110124031528.000|TR0|today saying they were going to examine 
20110124031528.000|20110124031531.000|TR0|security at police stations.  What are you 
20110124031531.000|20110124031533.000|TR0|hearing about that?
20110124031533.000|20110124031536.000|TR0|
20110124031536.000|20110124031538.000|TR0|WAIT:  That is something that they're 
20110124031538.000|20110124031541.000|TR0|talking about here.  And I do want to say 
20110124031541.000|20110124031544.000|TR0|that the officers, all four of them, they 
20110124031544.000|20110124031546.000|TR0|are believed that they will survive.  One 
20110124031546.000|20110124031549.000|TR0|was seriously injured, the commander and 
20110124031549.000|20110124031551.000|TR0|the others were hurt obviously as well, 
20110124031551.000|20110124031554.000|TR0|but they will come out of this OK.  That 
20110124031554.000|20110124031557.000|TR0|is the expectation at this point.
20110124031557.000|20110124031559.000|TR0|
20110124031559.000|20110124031602.000|TR0|But as you mentioned, security is a huge 
20110124031602.000|20110124031604.000|TR0|issue.  The officers in Detroit are very 
20110124031604.000|20110124031607.000|TR0|brave, very courageous men and women.  
20110124031607.000|20110124031610.000|TR0|They put their lives on the line every day 
20110124031610.000|20110124031612.000|TR0|here.
20110124031612.000|20110124031615.000|TR0|
20110124031615.000|20110124031617.000|TR0|As you know, we do have a serious crime 
20110124031617.000|20110124031620.000|TR0|issue in Detroit.  And the buildings here 
20110124031620.000|20110124031623.000|TR0|are very community-friendly.  Folks can 
20110124031623.000|20110124031625.000|TR0|come in here and talk with these officers. 
20110124031625.000|20110124031628.000|TR0| These officers take it very seriously, 
20110124031628.000|20110124031631.000|TR0|being able to interact with folks in the 
20110124031631.000|20110124031633.000|TR0|community.  So they don't have barriers in 
20110124031633.000|20110124031636.000|TR0|these police stations.  People are able to 
20110124031636.000|20110124031638.000|TR0|just walk in and walk right up to the desk 
20110124031638.000|20110124031641.000|TR0|and speak with police officers.
20110124031641.000|20110124031644.000|TR0|
20110124031644.000|20110124031646.000|TR0|In fact, the one just behind me here, 
20110124031646.000|20110124031649.000|TR0|you're able to walk in and it's very 
20110124031649.000|20110124031651.000|TR0|typical for officers to even see what 
20110124031651.000|20110124031654.000|TR0|you're carrying.
20110124031654.000|20110124031657.000|TR0|
20110124031657.000|20110124031659.000|TR0|So in this case, I'm told by sources here 
20110124031659.000|20110124031702.000|TR0|on the scene that they didn't even know 
20110124031702.000|20110124031704.000|TR0|that this guy was carrying a gun because 
20110124031704.000|20110124031707.000|TR0|the desk is kind of high up and the 
20110124031707.000|20110124031710.000|TR0|officer sits a bit low.  So in this case 
20110124031710.000|20110124031712.000|TR0|they just didn't even know he had a weapon.
20110124031712.000|20110124031715.000|TR0|
20110124031715.000|20110124031717.000|TR0|LEMON:  Tom Wait and Lindsey Cohen, thanks 
20110124031717.000|20110124031720.000|TR0|to both of you.
20110124031720.000|20110124031723.000|TR0|
20110124031723.000|20110124031725.000|TR0|Also today, an Indianapolis police officer 
20110124031725.000|20110124031728.000|TR0|was shot during a traffic stop.  
20110124031728.000|20110124031730.000|TR0|Authorities say Officer David Moore was 
20110124031730.000|20110124031733.000|TR0|hit four times and is now in a coma.  A 
20110124031733.000|20110124031736.000|TR0|suspect is in custody. Today's shootings 
20110124031736.000|20110124031738.000|TR0|are part of several involving officers in 
20110124031738.000|20110124031741.000|TR0|just the past month.  In Miami, just on 
20110124031741.000|20110124031743.000|TR0|Thursday, two officers were shot and 
20110124031743.000|20110124031746.000|TR0|killed while serving a warrant.   The 
20110124031746.000|20110124031749.000|TR0|suspect in that case was killed.
20110124031749.000|20110124031751.000|TR0|
20110124031751.000|20110124031754.000|TR0|In Lakewood, New Jersey, on January 14th, 
20110124031754.000|20110124031756.000|TR0|police say an officer was killed when he 
20110124031756.000|20110124031759.000|TR0|stopped a man for questioning.  A suspect 
20110124031759.000|20110124031802.000|TR0|is now in custody in that case as well.
20110124031802.000|20110124031804.000|TR0|
20110124031804.000|20110124031807.000|TR0|And in Atlanta on December 27th, a state 
20110124031807.000|20110124031809.000|TR0|trooper was shot and killed after a short 
20110124031809.000|20110124031812.000|TR0|car chase.  A suspect has been charged.
20110124031812.000|20110124031815.000|TR0|
20110124031815.000|20110124031817.000|TR0|And this may be a larger trend, we're 
20110124031817.000|20110124031820.000|TR0|hearing from law enforcement. The National 
20110124031820.000|20110124031822.000|TR0|Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund 
20110124031822.000|20110124031825.000|TR0|found there was a 20 percent jump in the 
20110124031825.000|20110124031828.000|TR0|number of officers shot and killed in the 
20110124031828.000|20110124031830.000|TR0|line of duty from 2009 to 2010.

20110124031833.000|20110124031835.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords suffered 
20110124031835.000|20110124031838.000|TR0|a gunshot to the head at point-blank range 
20110124031838.000|20110124031841.000|TR0|and she survived it.  Few people can 
20110124031841.000|20110124031843.000|TR0|relate to what happened, one of them, the 
20110124031843.000|20110124031846.000|TR0|victim of one of the most famous love

20110124031859.000|20110124031901.000|TR0|THE HEAD:  I was told after the fact that 
20110124031901.000|20110124031904.000|TR0|when I was in the hospital, my son came to 
20110124031904.000|20110124031907.000|TR0|me and they said, you know, squeeze her 
20110124031907.000|20110124031909.000|TR0|hand.  And I squeezed it back.  I don't

20110124031933.000|20110124031935.000|TR0|911 for some pretty ridiculous reasons.  
20110124031935.000|20110124031938.000|TR0|But this one is really a new one.  One

20110124032004.000|20110124032007.000|TR0|LEMON:  Several viral videos caught our 
20110124032007.000|20110124032009.000|TR0|attention this week.  First off, the 
20110124032009.000|20110124032012.000|TR0|future of 3d imaging.

20110124032020.000|20110124032022.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here, I see a -- I see 
20110124032022.000|20110124032025.000|TR0|a totally shape that appears to really 
20110124032025.000|20110124032027.000|TR0|real.  I couldn't even touch it.  The 
20110124032027.000|20110124032030.000|TR0|quality is really amazing.  And you feel 
20110124032030.000|20110124032033.000|TR0|much better because what is great about it 
20110124032033.000|20110124032035.000|TR0|is that you have nothing to -

20110124032043.000|20110124032046.000|TR0|LEMON:  You can see there a small device 
20110124032046.000|20110124032048.000|TR0|attached to his temples.  The eyes flutter 
20110124032048.000|20110124032051.000|TR0|wildly.  And we doubt movie audiences will 
20110124032051.000|20110124032053.000|TR0|go for it, you never know, but it is 
20110124032053.000|20110124032056.000|TR0|definitely one of the more unusual videos 
20110124032056.000|20110124032059.000|TR0|we saw this week.
20110124032059.000|20110124032101.000|TR0|
20110124032101.000|20110124032104.000|TR0|And you ever wonder what makes normally 
20110124032104.000|20110124032106.000|TR0|sane people go ice fishing?
20110124032106.000|20110124032109.000|TR0|
20110124032109.000|20110124032112.000|TR0|Here's one big reason.

20110124032119.000|20110124032122.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's kicking.  Oh, my 
20110124032122.000|20110124032125.000|TR0|goodness, dude!  Wholly buckets!  Oh, this 
20110124032125.000|20110124032127.000|TR0|thing is a hog!  Holy ((EXPLETIVE DELETED).

20110124032135.000|20110124032138.000|TR0|LEMON:  That almost sounds like the 
20110124032138.000|20110124032140.000|TR0|Rainbow Guy.  Double rainbows. All right.  
20110124032140.000|20110124032143.000|TR0|Well, Jeremy Rydberg and Jason Greatsinger 
20110124032143.000|20110124032145.000|TR0|are two diehard ice fishermen in 
20110124032145.000|20110124032148.000|TR0|Wisconsin.  Their adventures appear on the 
20110124032148.000|20110124032151.000|TR0|website jigheadstv.com.  They caught this 
20110124032151.000|20110124032153.000|TR0|whopper on Lake Superior.  As you can see, 
20110124032153.000|20110124032156.000|TR0|it almost was too big to fit through that 
20110124032156.000|20110124032159.000|TR0|hole.  They didn't keep it, though.  After 
20110124032159.000|20110124032201.000|TR0|documenting the fish, well, they simply 
20110124032201.000|20110124032204.000|TR0|let just it go.
20110124032204.000|20110124032206.000|TR0|
20110124032206.000|20110124032209.000|TR0|All right.  I need you warn you, this next 
20110124032209.000|20110124032212.000|TR0|video is a little disturbing to watch.  We 
20110124032212.000|20110124032214.000|TR0|are not recommending that anyone try this, 
20110124032214.000|20110124032217.000|TR0|but in some parts of the world, this 
20110124032217.000|20110124032219.000|TR0|unusual practice is catching on. The video 
20110124032219.000|20110124032222.000|TR0|is not fake, people.  That is a real 
20110124032222.000|20110124032225.000|TR0|infant.  There is an article about it in 
20110124032225.000|20110124032227.000|TR0|"Time" magazine.  The practice is called 
20110124032227.000|20110124032230.000|TR0|baby yoga.  Advocates believe it makes 
20110124032230.000|20110124032232.000|TR0|newborns confident and fearless. Wow, 
20110124032232.000|20110124032235.000|TR0|looks a little scary, too.

20110124032238.000|20110124032240.000|TR0|Some words of wisdom before you head to 
20110124032240.000|20110124032243.000|TR0|the grocery store this week. They don't 
20110124032243.000|20110124032245.000|TR0|want to tell you.  But our Stephanie Elam 
20110124032245.000|20110124032248.000|TR0|has tonight's edition of "Mastering your 
20110124032248.000|20110124032251.000|TR0|Money."
20110124032251.000|20110124032253.000|TR0|
20110124032253.000|20110124032256.000|TR0|Hi, Steph.
20110124032256.000|20110124032258.000|TR0|
20110124032258.000|20110124032301.000|TR0|STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN BUSINESS NEWS 
20110124032301.000|20110124032304.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:   Hey, Don.
20110124032304.000|20110124032306.000|TR0|
20110124032306.000|20110124032309.000|TR0|It's the case of the incredible shrinking 
20110124032309.000|20110124032311.000|TR0|products.  "Consumer Reports" tipped us 
20110124032311.000|20110124032314.000|TR0|off to a whole slew of household products 
20110124032314.000|20110124032317.000|TR0|that are up to 20 percent smaller these 
20110124032317.000|20110124032319.000|TR0|days but the cost of them stayed the same. 
20110124032319.000|20110124032322.000|TR0| Manufacturers are hoping you're not going 
20110124032322.000|20110124032324.000|TR0|to notice.
20110124032324.000|20110124032327.000|TR0|
20110124032327.000|20110124032330.000|TR0|Let's tell you what we're talking about 
20110124032330.000|20110124032332.000|TR0|here by showing you your morning OJ.  
20110124032332.000|20110124032335.000|TR0|Sure, these two cartons look just alike at 
20110124032335.000|20110124032337.000|TR0|first glance. But upon closer inspection, 
20110124032337.000|20110124032340.000|TR0|you're getting almost 8 percent less juice 
20110124032340.000|20110124032343.000|TR0|now than you were before.  Tropicana is 
20110124032343.000|20110124032345.000|TR0|keeping their price by converting from 64 
20110124032345.000|20110124032348.000|TR0|ounces to 59 ounces.
20110124032348.000|20110124032350.000|TR0|
20110124032350.000|20110124032353.000|TR0|And let's talk a little bit about toilet 
20110124032353.000|20110124032356.000|TR0|paper here for a second. You're still 
20110124032356.000|20110124032358.000|TR0|getting 1,000 sheets of this popular brand 
20110124032358.000|20110124032401.000|TR0|but the squares are smaller.  The change 
20110124032401.000|20110124032403.000|TR0|was made to help offset rising material 
20110124032403.000|20110124032406.000|TR0|costs.  But you're getting nearly 10 
20110124032406.000|20110124032409.000|TR0|percent less for the same price which is a 
20110124032409.000|20110124032411.000|TR0|real bummer.  Sorry, can't resist.
20110124032411.000|20110124032414.000|TR0|
20110124032414.000|20110124032416.000|TR0|And lastly, this detergent got a little 
20110124032416.000|20110124032419.000|TR0|bit different story.  Their slogan may be 
20110124032419.000|20110124032422.000|TR0|100 percent pure but you're getting 20 
20110124032422.000|20110124032424.000|TR0|percent less soap in these new bottles.  
20110124032424.000|20110124032427.000|TR0|But Ivory told us they also shrank the 
20110124032427.000|20110124032429.000|TR0|price when they shrank their bottle from 
20110124032429.000|20110124032432.000|TR0|30 to 24 ounces.
20110124032432.000|20110124032435.000|TR0|
20110124032435.000|20110124032437.000|TR0|So listen up here.  The best way to ensure 
20110124032437.000|20110124032440.000|TR0|you're getting the most for your money is 
20110124032440.000|20110124032443.000|TR0|to check the unit price on the store shelf 
20110124032443.000|20110124032445.000|TR0|in addition to the item cost on the actual 
20110124032445.000|20110124032448.000|TR0|product.  That giant or family-sized 
20110124032448.000|20110124032450.000|TR0|container might not be the best deal after 
20110124032450.000|20110124032453.000|TR0|all.  So you just want to make sure you 
20110124032453.000|20110124032456.000|TR0|check that before you buy -- Don.
20110124032456.000|20110124032458.000|TR0|
20110124032458.000|20110124032501.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right, Stephanie, thank you 
20110124032501.000|20110124032503.000|TR0|very much.
20110124032503.000|20110124032506.000|TR0|
20110124032506.000|20110124032509.000|TR0|What does Rudy Guiliani's decision to run 
20110124032509.000|20110124032511.000|TR0|for president have to do with Sarah Palin? 
20110124032511.000|20110124032514.000|TR0| You'll hear how he answered that 
20110124032514.000|20110124032516.000|TR0|question.  That's coming up next.
20110124032516.000|20110124032519.000|TR0|
20110124032519.000|20110124032522.000|TR0|And a Utah state trooper is under 
20110124032522.000|20110124032524.000|TR0|investigation for what he did to a woman 
20110124032524.000|20110124032527.000|TR0|at a traffic stop, and it was all caught 
20110124032527.000|20110124032529.000|TR0|on camera.  You'll see it play out 
20110124032529.000|20110124032532.000|TR0|straight ahead.

20110124032540.000|20110124032542.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right.  This just in to CNN 
20110124032542.000|20110124032545.000|TR0|and it is sad news.  Jack LaLanne, 
20110124032545.000|20110124032548.000|TR0|considered the founding father of fitness, 
20110124032548.000|20110124032550.000|TR0|has died.  His agent confirmed his death 
20110124032550.000|20110124032553.000|TR0|to CNN.  LaLanne, who was 96, was a 
20110124032553.000|20110124032555.000|TR0|pioneer of bringing exercise to television 
20110124032555.000|20110124032558.000|TR0|with his workout show that ran 34 years 
20110124032558.000|20110124032601.000|TR0|from the 1950s all the way into the '70s.  
20110124032601.000|20110124032603.000|TR0|He maintained his muscular build through 
20110124032603.000|20110124032606.000|TR0|his '80s.  His agent Rick Hersh says 
20110124032606.000|20110124032608.000|TR0|LaLanne exercised every day up until his 
20110124032608.000|20110124032611.000|TR0|last day.  He also ran a chain of about 
20110124032611.000|20110124032614.000|TR0|100 health spas, many of which he later 
20110124032614.000|20110124032616.000|TR0|sold to Bally's.

20110124032647.000|20110124032650.000|TR0|early days of television.  He was like a 
20110124032650.000|20110124032653.000|TR0|television original.  There was no one 
20110124032653.000|20110124032655.000|TR0|like Jack LaLanne.  It would seem like he 
20110124032655.000|20110124032658.000|TR0|would go on -- go on forever.  Not 
20110124032658.000|20110124032700.000|TR0|surprising to hear that he would exercise 
20110124032700.000|20110124032703.000|TR0|on the -- on the day of his death.  He was 
20110124032703.000|20110124032706.000|TR0|a true guru.
20110124032706.000|20110124032708.000|TR0|
20110124032708.000|20110124032711.000|TR0|You can't think of who -- I guess Charles 
20110124032711.000|20110124032713.000|TR0|Atlas and the old comic books would have 
20110124032713.000|20110124032716.000|TR0|been the predecessor for Jack LaLanne.  He 
20110124032716.000|20110124032719.000|TR0|was indestructible.  He was also very 
20110124032719.000|20110124032721.000|TR0|sharp business guy.  He opened all those, 
20110124032721.000|20110124032724.000|TR0|you know, he had those centers and as you 
20110124032724.000|20110124032727.000|TR0|said he sold it to Bally.  He made a great 
20110124032727.000|20110124032729.000|TR0|deal of money in his life.
20110124032729.000|20110124032732.000|TR0|
20110124032732.000|20110124032734.000|TR0|He also helped us, a lot of people.  He 
20110124032734.000|20110124032737.000|TR0|gave a lot of encouragements. Elderly 
20110124032737.000|20110124032740.000|TR0|people are encouraged by him because he 
20110124032740.000|20110124032742.000|TR0|kept on going.  He was also a very good 
20110124032742.000|20110124032745.000|TR0|guest, very responsive.  He'd like to do 
20110124032745.000|20110124032747.000|TR0|-- in the early days, he would do wild 
20110124032747.000|20110124032750.000|TR0|things.  He'd do crazy exercises with 
20110124032750.000|20110124032753.000|TR0|young people.  He out-exercised people 30 
20110124032753.000|20110124032755.000|TR0|years younger than him. LEMON:  Larry, I 
20110124032755.000|20110124032758.000|TR0|think it's fair to say that all of the 
20110124032758.000|20110124032800.000|TR0|people who came along, like Suzann Somers, 
20110124032800.000|20110124032803.000|TR0|even Jane Fonda and all of this fitness 
20110124032803.000|20110124032806.000|TR0|craze, he really ushered that in, didn't 
20110124032806.000|20110124032808.000|TR0|he?
20110124032808.000|20110124032811.000|TR0|
20110124032811.000|20110124032813.000|TR0|KING:  Correct.  He is -- he is the 
20110124032813.000|20110124032816.000|TR0|forerunner.  There was no one quite like 
20110124032816.000|20110124032819.000|TR0|him.  You know, exercises don't work on 
20110124032819.000|20110124032821.000|TR0|radio.  So it had to be a television.  
20110124032821.000|20110124032824.000|TR0|Think about that.  It had to be a 
20110124032824.000|20110124032826.000|TR0|television medium.  And he prospered, made 
20110124032826.000|20110124032829.000|TR0|it happen.  And I think all those people, 
20110124032829.000|20110124032832.000|TR0|the Somers, the Fondas, the rest, owe him 
20110124032832.000|20110124032834.000|TR0|a debt of gratitude. You know, when you -- 
20110124032834.000|20110124032837.000|TR0|when you start something, when you do -- 
20110124032837.000|20110124032839.000|TR0|when you're an original, you can -- that 
20110124032839.000|20110124032842.000|TR0|will never be taken away from him in the 
20110124032842.000|20110124032845.000|TR0|textbooks.  He started it.
20110124032845.000|20110124032847.000|TR0|
20110124032847.000|20110124032850.000|TR0|LEMON:  Yes.  An original just as you are, 
20110124032850.000|20110124032852.000|TR0|Larry.
20110124032852.000|20110124032855.000|TR0|
20110124032855.000|20110124032858.000|TR0|KING:  Oh.
20110124032858.000|20110124032900.000|TR0|
20110124032900.000|20110124032903.000|TR0|LEMON:  So, is there anything that you 
20110124032903.000|20110124032905.000|TR0|remember most about him?  I know you're a 
20110124032905.000|20110124032908.000|TR0|reporter.  You like reporter involvement 
20110124032908.000|20110124032911.000|TR0|and many times -- did you exercise with 
20110124032911.000|20110124032913.000|TR0|him?  Did he ever drag you into it?
20110124032913.000|20110124032916.000|TR0|
20110124032916.000|20110124032918.000|TR0|KING:  I did, I did.  The first few times 
20110124032918.000|20110124032921.000|TR0|he came on television, we did some stuff 
20110124032921.000|20110124032924.000|TR0|together and then I got too old for him.  
20110124032924.000|20110124032926.000|TR0|Not for my mind but my body couldn't do 
20110124032926.000|20110124032929.000|TR0|it.  I could never do -- I would doubt 
20110124032929.000|20110124032931.000|TR0|that people half his age could not do what 
20110124032931.000|20110124032934.000|TR0|he did at age 90.  He was -- he was 
20110124032934.000|20110124032937.000|TR0|extraordinary.  I don't think he had any 
20110124032937.000|20110124032939.000|TR0|fat weight on him.
20110124032939.000|20110124032942.000|TR0|
20110124032942.000|20110124032944.000|TR0|LEMON:  Larry, is there anything you want 
20110124032944.000|20110124032947.000|TR0|to say to his wife, Elaine Doyle?
20110124032947.000|20110124032950.000|TR0|
20110124032950.000|20110124032952.000|TR0|KING:  Elaine, you had a great man.  You 
20110124032952.000|20110124032955.000|TR0|had him for a long time. When someone 
20110124032955.000|20110124032957.000|TR0|makes it to 96, that's a blessing and you 
20110124032957.000|20110124033000.000|TR0|should be happy in the knowledge that you 
20110124033000.000|20110124033003.000|TR0|were married to a true original.
20110124033003.000|20110124033005.000|TR0|
20110124033005.000|20110124033008.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right.  CNN's Larry King.
20110124033008.000|20110124033011.000|TR0|
20110124033011.000|20110124033013.000|TR0|Larry, thank you so much for joining us.
20110124033013.000|20110124033016.000|TR0|
20110124033016.000|20110124033018.000|TR0|KING:  Thanks, Don.  Thanks, Don.

20110124033021.000|20110124033024.000|TR0|LEMON:  It's good to hear from you.  We 
20110124033024.000|20110124033026.000|TR0|miss you and we are happy that you're 
20110124033026.000|20110124033029.000|TR0|moving on and doing new things.  Thanks,

20110124033039.000|20110124033042.000|TR0|LEMON:  All right.  We're back in a moment 
20110124033042.000|20110124033044.000|TR0|here on CNN.

20110124033052.000|20110124033055.000|TR0|LEMON:  Now for some of the stories that 
20110124033055.000|20110124033057.000|TR0|caught our eye happening across the 
20110124033057.000|20110124033100.000|TR0|country.
20110124033100.000|20110124033103.000|TR0|
20110124033103.000|20110124033105.000|TR0|A Utah trooper is under investigation 
20110124033105.000|20110124033108.000|TR0|after a video showed him punching a woman. 
20110124033108.000|20110124033110.000|TR0| You can see Sergeant Andrew Davenport on 
20110124033110.000|20110124033113.000|TR0|the right in this dash-cam video, as he 
20110124033113.000|20110124033116.000|TR0|tries to handle the 53-year-old woman 
20110124033116.000|20110124033118.000|TR0|behind the wheel by hitting her several 
20110124033118.000|20110124033121.000|TR0|times.  The confrontation happened in 
20110124033121.000|20110124033123.000|TR0|August and the officer is on paid leave.  
20110124033123.000|20110124033126.000|TR0|Authorities say Darla Wright had tried to 
20110124033126.000|20110124033129.000|TR0|escape patrol cars that had trapped her by 
20110124033129.000|20110124033131.000|TR0|ramming back and forth between them.  
20110124033131.000|20110124033134.000|TR0|Another officer Taser Wright (ph), who

20110124033144.000|20110124033147.000|TR0|OK.  We've heard of a bad hair day, right? 
20110124033147.000|20110124033149.000|TR0| But a Florida woman is facing charges 
20110124033149.000|20110124033152.000|TR0|after repeatedly calling 911 to report a 
20110124033152.000|20110124033155.000|TR0|bad manicure. Cynthia Colson's bad nail 
20110124033155.000|20110124033157.000|TR0|day started with a trip to the manicure 
20110124033157.000|20110124033200.000|TR0|salon in Deltona.  She says the nail 
20110124033200.000|20110124033202.000|TR0|technician manhandled her after she 
20110124033202.000|20110124033205.000|TR0|complained about the length of her nails.  
20110124033205.000|20110124033208.000|TR0|Police say she called 911 at least four 
20110124033208.000|20110124033210.000|TR0|times.  They say once was enough.

20110124033221.000|20110124033223.000|TR0|You don't handle my nails like this.  She 
20110124033223.000|20110124033226.000|TR0|had the nail clip in her right hand as she 
20110124033226.000|20110124033228.000|TR0|was talking with it and then she hit my

20110124033257.000|20110124033300.000|TR0|police say Colson called 911 a final time

20110124033326.000|20110124033328.000|TR0|in 20-degree weather.  20-degree weather.  
20110124033328.000|20110124033331.000|TR0|That's right.  Proceeds will help kids who 
20110124033331.000|20110124033334.000|TR0|otherwise couldn't afford go to summer 
20110124033334.000|20110124033336.000|TR0|camp, where it's much warmer and they 
20110124033336.000|20110124033339.000|TR0|don't have to jump into the cold water.
20110124033339.000|20110124033341.000|TR0|
20110124033341.000|20110124033344.000|TR0|In Utah, skis and couches joined forces 
20110124033344.000|20110124033347.000|TR0|for a unique winter sport, I'll say.  It's 
20110124033347.000|20110124033349.000|TR0|called couch skiing or "skouching, "and 
20110124033349.000|20110124033352.000|TR0|it's really caught on among college 
20110124033352.000|20110124033354.000|TR0|students in Utah.  You take an old couch, 
20110124033354.000|20110124033357.000|TR0|nail on some old skis and what you get is 
20110124033357.000|20110124033400.000|TR0|a totally unique way to sled down the 
20110124033400.000|20110124033402.000|TR0|slopes.  Skouchers say the event is great 
20110124033402.000|20110124033405.000|TR0|fun but also a lot of work.  Once you 
20110124033405.000|20110124033407.000|TR0|enjoy the ride down, you have to push the 
20110124033407.000|20110124033410.000|TR0|contraption back up the hill.  No free 
20110124033410.000|20110124033413.000|TR0|rides anywhere.

20110124033415.000|20110124033418.000|TR0|All right.  We're following three

20110124033423.000|20110124033426.000|TR0|Police officers targeted by shooters in 
20110124033426.000|20110124033428.000|TR0|two different cities, one in a Wal-Mart 
20110124033428.000|20110124033431.000|TR0|parking lot, the other inside a police 
20110124033431.000|20110124033433.000|TR0|precinct.

20110124033449.000|20110124033452.000|TR0|Also, Tuesday night is date night for 
20110124033452.000|20110124033454.000|TR0|members of Congress.  That's among other 
20110124033454.000|20110124033457.000|TR0|stories, among the stories that will be 
20110124033457.000|20110124033459.000|TR0|making news in your week ahead.  From

20110124033526.000|20110124033528.000|TR0|LEMON:  Very busy night here news-wise.
20110124033528.000|20110124033531.000|TR0|
20110124033531.000|20110124033533.000|TR0|A Detroit police officer seriously wounded 
20110124033533.000|20110124033536.000|TR0|today in a shooting is out of surgery and 
20110124033536.000|20110124033539.000|TR0|is expected to survive.  In all, four 
20110124033539.000|20110124033541.000|TR0|officers were wounded when a gunman walked 
20110124033541.000|20110124033544.000|TR0|into the station precinct and opened fire. 
20110124033544.000|20110124033546.000|TR0| The gunman was killed as police returned 
20110124033546.000|20110124033549.000|TR0|fire.
20110124033549.000|20110124033552.000|TR0|
20110124033552.000|20110124033554.000|TR0|We're following another shooting involving 
20110124033554.000|20110124033557.000|TR0|law enforcement in Washington State.  
20110124033557.000|20110124033559.000|TR0|Investigators say two people were killed 
20110124033559.000|20110124033602.000|TR0|outside a Wal-Mart in Port Orchard.  One 
20110124033602.000|20110124033605.000|TR0|of them is a suspect and the other is an 
20110124033605.000|20110124033607.000|TR0|unidentified woman.  Two deputies were 
20110124033607.000|20110124033610.000|TR0|also shot and transferred to Tacoma for 
20110124033610.000|20110124033612.000|TR0|treatment.  Their injuries are not 
20110124033612.000|20110124033615.000|TR0|considered life- threatening.
20110124033615.000|20110124033618.000|TR0|
20110124033618.000|20110124033620.000|TR0|In Connecticut, federal kidnapping charges 
20110124033620.000|20110124033623.000|TR0|have been filed in the 1987 kidnapping of 
20110124033623.000|20110124033625.000|TR0|a baby girl from a New York hospital.  The 
20110124033625.000|20110124033628.000|TR0|FBI in Bridgeport says Ann Pettway turned 
20110124033628.000|20110124033631.000|TR0|herself in this morning.  Pettway 
20110124033631.000|20110124033633.000|TR0|allegedly snatched the infant 23 years ago 
20110124033633.000|20110124033636.000|TR0|and then raised the girl as her own 
20110124033636.000|20110124033638.000|TR0|daughter.  That girl, Carlina White, now 
20110124033638.000|20110124033641.000|TR0|23 years old, recently discovered her true 
20110124033641.000|20110124033644.000|TR0|identity and was reunited last week with 
20110124033644.000|20110124033646.000|TR0|her biological family.

20110124033649.000|20110124033651.000|TR0|Bitter cold weather in the Northeast.  
20110124033651.000|20110124033654.000|TR0|Tomorrow morning will be dangerous.  Plus, 
20110124033654.000|20110124033657.000|TR0|travel delays for the Midwest.  
20110124033657.000|20110124033659.000|TR0|Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras with more.

20110124033702.000|20110124033704.000|TR0|And a warning, I'm sure, Jacqui.

20110124033707.000|20110124033710.000|TR0|JACQUI JERAS, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Yes.

20110124033712.000|20110124033715.000|TR0|LEMON:  Be patient and look out.  Be 
20110124033715.000|20110124033717.000|TR0|careful.
20110124033717.000|20110124033720.000|TR0|
20110124033720.000|20110124033723.000|TR0|JERAS:  And bundle up, too, because it 
20110124033723.000|20110124033725.000|TR0|really is going to be dangerously cold.  
20110124033725.000|20110124033728.000|TR0|In fact, you could get frostbite in just a 
20110124033728.000|20110124033730.000|TR0|matter of minutes here across the 
20110124033730.000|20110124033733.000|TR0|Northeast.  This is the coldest air that 
20110124033733.000|20110124033736.000|TR0|you've seen so far this season.

20110124033746.000|20110124033749.000|TR0|but they...

20110124033751.000|20110124033754.000|TR0|JERAS:  They love it, but it's so 
20110124033754.000|20110124033756.000|TR0|dangerous.

20110124033820.000|20110124033823.000|TR0|right.  Now to our correspondents from

20110124033836.000|20110124033838.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Ed Henry at the White 
20110124033838.000|20110124033841.000|TR0|House, where on Tuesday night the 
20110124033841.000|20110124033843.000|TR0|president heads to Capitol Hill for the 
20110124033843.000|20110124033846.000|TR0|big State of the Union address.  Senior 
20110124033846.000|20110124033849.000|TR0|aides say it will have the twin themes of 
20110124033849.000|20110124033851.000|TR0|creating jobs and promoting American 
20110124033851.000|20110124033854.000|TR0|competitiveness around the world.  On

20110124033909.000|20110124033912.000|TR0|the big story we're following this week is 
20110124033912.000|20110124033915.000|TR0|the State of the Union.  From where the 
20110124033915.000|20110124033917.000|TR0|president stands, the House chamber could 
20110124033917.000|20110124033920.000|TR0|look a little different this year.  Many 
20110124033920.000|20110124033922.000|TR0|lawmakers have already committed to 
20110124033922.000|20110124033925.000|TR0|sitting next to someone from the opposing 
20110124033925.000|20110124033928.000|TR0|party for Tuesday's address.

20110124033930.000|20110124033933.000|TR0|We'll also be following the Republicans' 
20110124033933.000|20110124033935.000|TR0|official response to this State of the 
20110124033935.000|20110124033938.000|TR0|Union.  Paul Ryan, the new chairman of the 
20110124033938.000|20110124033941.000|TR0|House Budget Committee and the House GOP's 
20110124033941.000|20110124033943.000|TR0|top guy on spending cuts, will be giving 
20110124033943.000|20110124033946.000|TR0|that rebuttal.  He might not be a familiar 
20110124033946.000|20110124033948.000|TR0|face to many of you right now, but he'll 
20110124033948.000|20110124033951.000|TR0|become very familiar as Republicans focus 
20110124033951.000|20110124033954.000|TR0|on spending cuts this Congress.

20110124034009.000|20110124034012.000|TR0|Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty 
20110124034012.000|20110124034014.000|TR0|speaks to New Hampshire tomorrow and

20110124034017.000|20110124034020.000|TR0|Speaker Newt Gingrich speaks in Iowa.  
20110124034020.000|20110124034022.000|TR0|Now, both states play crucial roles in the 
20110124034022.000|20110124034025.000|TR0|race for the White House as they go 
20110124034025.000|20110124034027.000|TR0|one-two in the primary calendar.

20110124034051.000|20110124034054.000|TR0|that's going to be the big focus this 
20110124034054.000|20110124034056.000|TR0|week.  The government will report fourth 
20110124034056.000|20110124034059.000|TR0|quarter GDP on Friday and it's expected to 
20110124034059.000|20110124034101.000|TR0|show that U.S. economy grew at about 3.8 
20110124034101.000|20110124034104.000|TR0|percent annual pace during the past three 
20110124034104.000|20110124034107.000|TR0|months.  That would be an improvement from 
20110124034107.000|20110124034109.000|TR0|the third quarter pace of 2.6 percent.

20110124034201.000|20110124034204.000|TR0|in U.S. history.  I talked with a former

20110124034227.000|20110124034230.000|TR0|remarkable recovery from being shot in the

20110124034232.000|20110124034235.000|TR0|very closely is Mary Jo Buttafuoco.  She 
20110124034235.000|20110124034238.000|TR0|survived her own bullet to the head in 1n

20110124034240.000|20110124034243.000|TR0|husband's teenaged mistress. Buttafuoco 
20110124034243.000|20110124034245.000|TR0|describes her ordeal in her memoirs.  It's 
20110124034245.000|20110124034248.000|TR0|called "Getting It Through My Thick Skull."

20110124034251.000|20110124034253.000|TR0|Earlier, I spoke with Buttafuoco about her 
20110124034253.000|20110124034256.000|TR0|experience and what she thinks Giffords 
20110124034256.000|20110124034258.000|TR0|might be going through.

20110124034309.000|20110124034311.000|TR0|THE HEAD:  The first few days, you don't 
20110124034311.000|20110124034314.000|TR0|even know what has happened to you.  You 
20110124034314.000|20110124034317.000|TR0|can't imagine.  You're in this cocoon.  
20110124034317.000|20110124034319.000|TR0|You're sedated.  And you've got people, 
20110124034319.000|20110124034322.000|TR0|you know, kind of yelling in your ears to 
20110124034322.000|20110124034324.000|TR0|try to make you wake up and stay awake.  
20110124034324.000|20110124034327.000|TR0|But it sounds now like maybe, you know, 
20110124034327.000|20110124034330.000|TR0|she's in pain, which is the next step.  
20110124034330.000|20110124034332.000|TR0|Once she does start to come out of the 
20110124034332.000|20110124034335.000|TR0|anesthesia and does start to -- and they 
20110124034335.000|20110124034338.000|TR0|start to say to her, OK, get up, you got 
20110124034338.000|20110124034340.000|TR0|to walk, you got to talk, you've got to do 
20110124034340.000|20110124034343.000|TR0|all this, it's going to be a very long, 
20110124034343.000|20110124034345.000|TR0|long, painful recovery.
20110124034345.000|20110124034348.000|TR0|
20110124034348.000|20110124034351.000|TR0|LEMON:  And you were responsive as well, 
20110124034351.000|20110124034353.000|TR0|but you said -- and you don't remember 
20110124034353.000|20110124034356.000|TR0|anything they asked you.  There was one 
20110124034356.000|20110124034358.000|TR0|day all of a sudden that clicked that they 
20110124034358.000|20110124034401.000|TR0|had told you a long time before what had 
20110124034401.000|20110124034404.000|TR0|happened to you but you didn't -- you 
20110124034404.000|20110124034406.000|TR0|didn't remember any of that.
20110124034406.000|20110124034409.000|TR0|
20110124034409.000|20110124034411.000|TR0|BUTTAFUOCO:  Yes.  My vivid memories was I 
20110124034411.000|20110124034414.000|TR0|was told after the fact that when I was in 
20110124034414.000|20110124034417.000|TR0|the hospital, my son came to me and they 
20110124034417.000|20110124034419.000|TR0|said, you know, squeeze her hand and I 
20110124034419.000|20110124034422.000|TR0|squeezed it back.  I don't remember that. 
20110124034422.000|20110124034424.000|TR0|My mother also said the same thing, that 
20110124034424.000|20110124034427.000|TR0|they would touch me and hold my hand and I 
20110124034427.000|20110124034430.000|TR0|would squeeze them, so.  But to this day, 
20110124034430.000|20110124034432.000|TR0|I don't have a memory of that.  But I 
20110124034432.000|20110124034435.000|TR0|guess I must have unconsciously felt that 
20110124034435.000|20110124034437.000|TR0|connection to them.
20110124034437.000|20110124034440.000|TR0|
20110124034440.000|20110124034443.000|TR0|LEMON:  Yes, yes.  And that's very 
20110124034443.000|20110124034445.000|TR0|important.  Her family, her husband and 
20110124034445.000|20110124034448.000|TR0|her friends being there.  That's what 
20110124034448.000|20110124034450.000|TR0|doctors are saying.
20110124034450.000|20110124034453.000|TR0|
20110124034453.000|20110124034456.000|TR0|BUTTAFUOCO:  Uh-huh, it is.  It's very -- 
20110124034456.000|20110124034458.000|TR0|and when the doctor then finally it was 
20110124034458.000|20110124034501.000|TR0|like kind of they yell because you're in 
20110124034501.000|20110124034503.000|TR0|this state of semi-consciousness and to 
20110124034503.000|20110124034506.000|TR0|tell you what's happening because they 
20110124034506.000|20110124034509.000|TR0|don't want to frighten you.  They want you 
20110124034509.000|20110124034511.000|TR0|to realize where you are, what's happened 
20110124034511.000|20110124034514.000|TR0|to you and everything like that.
20110124034514.000|20110124034516.000|TR0|
20110124034516.000|20110124034519.000|TR0|LEMON:  OK, Mary Jo, I want to bring in 
20110124034519.000|20110124034522.000|TR0|Dr. Sanjay Dhall.  He is Chief 
20110124034522.000|20110124034524.000|TR0|Neurosurgeon at Grady Hospital right here 
20110124034524.000|20110124034527.000|TR0|in Atlanta.
20110124034527.000|20110124034529.000|TR0|
20110124034529.000|20110124034532.000|TR0|So, Dr. Dhall, Mary Jo says that she, you 
20110124034532.000|20110124034535.000|TR0|know, really didn't fully understand what 
20110124034535.000|20110124034537.000|TR0|had happened for a long time.  Is that 
20110124034537.000|20110124034540.000|TR0|typical?  And do you think that's what 
20110124034540.000|20110124034542.000|TR0|Gabby Giffords -- do you think she knows 
20110124034542.000|20110124034545.000|TR0|the situation right now?
20110124034545.000|20110124034548.000|TR0|
20110124034548.000|20110124034550.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY DHALL, CHIEF NEUROSURGEON, 
20110124034550.000|20110124034553.000|TR0|GRADY HOSPITAL:  Yes, absolutely.  I've 
20110124034553.000|20110124034555.000|TR0|had many, many patients who have seen me 
20110124034555.000|20110124034558.000|TR0|many months after their injury who tell me 
20110124034558.000|20110124034601.000|TR0|that they have no recollection of the 
20110124034601.000|20110124034603.000|TR0|injury they suffered and the time that 
20110124034603.000|20110124034606.000|TR0|they spent in the hospital. And that's for 
20110124034606.000|20110124034608.000|TR0|a variety of reasons, one of which, 
20110124034608.000|20110124034611.000|TR0|obviously, being the head injury and also 
20110124034611.000|20110124034614.000|TR0|the different kinds of drugs that are 
20110124034614.000|20110124034616.000|TR0|constantly being administered.
20110124034616.000|20110124034619.000|TR0|
20110124034619.000|20110124034622.000|TR0|LEMON:  And because of the drugs.
20110124034622.000|20110124034624.000|TR0|
20110124034624.000|20110124034627.000|TR0|Mary Jo, tell us about the medication.  
20110124034627.000|20110124034629.000|TR0|That's a very important point because you 
20110124034629.000|20110124034632.000|TR0|became dependent on that medication.
20110124034632.000|20110124034635.000|TR0|
20110124034635.000|20110124034637.000|TR0|BUTTAFUOCO:  Yes, yes, I did.  
20110124034637.000|20110124034640.000|TR0|Unfortunately for me, nobody says no. No 
20110124034640.000|20110124034642.000|TR0|doctor says no to a woman who has a bullet 
20110124034642.000|20110124034645.000|TR0|in the head.  When you say, I'm dying and 
20110124034645.000|20110124034648.000|TR0|I'm in pain and I need this, they'll give 
20110124034648.000|20110124034650.000|TR0|it to you.  And they always said -- they 
20110124034650.000|20110124034653.000|TR0|were very good about it, they always said, 
20110124034653.000|20110124034655.000|TR0|you know, Mary Jo, you have a chance of 
20110124034655.000|20110124034658.000|TR0|getting addicted to this.  And when you're 
20110124034658.000|20110124034701.000|TR0|just suffering like that, you just say, I 
20110124034701.000|20110124034703.000|TR0|don't care, I need this to survive.  So, 
20110124034703.000|20110124034706.000|TR0|they tried.

20110124034708.000|20110124034711.000|TR0|But I think my trauma of everything else I 
20110124034711.000|20110124034714.000|TR0|went through with my husband and Amy 
20110124034714.000|20110124034716.000|TR0|Fisher and all that stuff, it just was -- 
20110124034716.000|20110124034719.000|TR0|it became easier for me to self-medicate 
20110124034719.000|20110124034721.000|TR0|myself when I was going through this other 
20110124034721.000|20110124034724.000|TR0|trauma.

20110124034740.000|20110124034742.000|TR0|LEMON:  It wasn't just the physical pain.  
20110124034742.000|20110124034745.000|TR0|It was emotional pain as well for you.
20110124034745.000|20110124034747.000|TR0|

20110124034753.000|20110124034755.000|TR0|LEMON:  So, Doctor, what would -- what 
20110124034755.000|20110124034758.000|TR0|would doctors do?  Will they do anything 
20110124034758.000|20110124034800.000|TR0|to keep the congresswoman from becoming 
20110124034800.000|20110124034803.000|TR0|addicted?

20110124034806.000|20110124034808.000|TR0|DHALL:  It's a very challenging problem to 
20110124034808.000|20110124034811.000|TR0|simultaneously try to control pain and 
20110124034811.000|20110124034813.000|TR0|simultaneously try to prevent dependence 
20110124034813.000|20110124034816.000|TR0|on pain medicine.  If somebody is on a 
20110124034816.000|20110124034819.000|TR0|narcotic pain medicine for a long enough 
20110124034819.000|20110124034821.000|TR0|time period, they will absolutely develop 
20110124034821.000|20110124034824.000|TR0|some form of dependence.  It's almost 
20110124034824.000|20110124034826.000|TR0|inevitable.  So, doctors will walk a fine 
20110124034826.000|20110124034829.000|TR0|line and decide at some point to start to 
20110124034829.000|20110124034832.000|TR0|wean those drugs away.

20110124034921.000|20110124034924.000|TR0|video that caught our attention this week. 
20110124034924.000|20110124034926.000|TR0| First off, a flying dog.  It's true.  The

20110124034929.000|20110124034932.000|TR0|and her fiance go paragliding every day in 
20110124034932.000|20110124034934.000|TR0|Hawaii.  Rather than leave the dog behind, 
20110124034934.000|20110124034937.000|TR0|they got a special harness, so all three 
20110124034937.000|20110124034939.000|TR0|of them can sail around the island 
20110124034939.000|20110124034942.000|TR0|together.

20110124034950.000|20110124034952.000|TR0|All right.  The song "Misirlou" is a 
20110124034952.000|20110124034955.000|TR0|popular tune that dates back to at least 
20110124034955.000|20110124034958.000|TR0|the 1920s.  But most people today 
20110124034958.000|20110124035000.000|TR0|associate it with the film "Pulp Fiction."

20110124035034.000|20110124035037.000|TR0|is his son, Mickey.  Partyzant tells CNN 
20110124035037.000|20110124035039.000|TR0|that he and his son often perform

20110124035142.000|20110124035144.000|TR0|Chinese government approved $45 billion 
20110124035144.000|20110124035147.000|TR0|worth of contracts for U.S. companies to 
20110124035147.000|20110124035150.000|TR0|export goods to China.  The administration 
20110124035150.000|20110124035152.000|TR0|says that could support an estimated

20110124035157.000|20110124035200.000|TR0|It didn't take long for WikiLeaks to get 
20110124035200.000|20110124035203.000|TR0|back in the headlines. Rudolph Elmer, a 
20110124035203.000|20110124035205.000|TR0|former Swiss banking executive, turned 
20110124035205.000|20110124035208.000|TR0|over thousands of what he claims are 
20110124035208.000|20110124035210.000|TR0|secret banking records to WikiLeaks 
20110124035210.000|20110124035213.000|TR0|founder Julian Assange last week.  Elmer 
20110124035213.000|20110124035216.000|TR0|was arrested on Wednesday for suspicion of 
20110124035216.000|20110124035218.000|TR0|violating banking laws.

20110124035223.000|20110124035226.000|TR0|the field.  NFL owners and players are 
20110124035226.000|20110124035229.000|TR0|locked a labor dispute that could shut 
20110124035229.000|20110124035231.000|TR0|down next season. The players association 
20110124035231.000|20110124035234.000|TR0|is taking its case to Capitol Hill, saying 
20110124035234.000|20110124035236.000|TR0|a lockout will cost each NFL city $150 
20110124035236.000|20110124035239.000|TR0|million of lost business.  The League says 
20110124035239.000|20110124035242.000|TR0|that number is inflated and Congress 
20110124035242.000|20110124035244.000|TR0|shouldn't get involved in the labor 
20110124035244.000|20110124035247.000|TR0|dispute.  Hope you enjoyed today's playoff

20110124035336.000|20110124035339.000|TR0|alleged Mob figures arrested in a single 
20110124035339.000|20110124035341.000|TR0|day.  It brings to mind some of the 
20110124035341.000|20110124035344.000|TR0|infamous Mafia stories we've seen over the 
20110124035344.000|20110124035347.000|TR0|years. One of the most well-known is 
20110124035347.000|20110124035349.000|TR0|"Goodfellas," the story of Henry Hill's 
20110124035349.000|20110124035352.000|TR0|rise and fall in the Mafia over three 
20110124035352.000|20110124035354.000|TR0|decades.  Take a look.

20110124035405.000|20110124035407.000|TR0|didn't mean anything.  When I was broke, I 
20110124035407.000|20110124035410.000|TR0|would go out and rob some more.  We ran 
20110124035410.000|20110124035413.000|TR0|everything.  We paid off cops.  We paid 
20110124035413.000|20110124035415.000|TR0|off lawyers.  We paid off judges.  
20110124035415.000|20110124035418.000|TR0|Everybody had their hands out.  Everything 
20110124035418.000|20110124035420.000|TR0|was for the taking.  And now it's all over.

20110124035431.000|20110124035434.000|TR0|Henry Hill.  But earlier, I talked to the 
20110124035434.000|20110124035436.000|TR0|real Henry Hill and asked him whether the 
20110124035436.000|20110124035439.000|TR0|Mob still wants him dead for becoming an 
20110124035439.000|20110124035441.000|TR0|informant.

20110124035449.000|20110124035452.000|TR0|HENRY HILL, FORMER ORGANIZED CRIME MEMBER: 
20110124035452.000|20110124035454.000|TR0| Not anymore.  I mean, that was 30 years 
20110124035454.000|20110124035457.000|TR0|ago.  The people I was involved with, 
20110124035457.000|20110124035500.000|TR0|they're all deceased or doing life 
20110124035500.000|20110124035502.000|TR0|sentences.  And that I think they have 
20110124035502.000|20110124035505.000|TR0|their own problems right now, especially 
20110124035505.000|20110124035507.000|TR0|with the bust in New York.  You know, with 
20110124035507.000|20110124035510.000|TR0|all those guys that got arrested.  I knew 
20110124035510.000|20110124035513.000|TR0|a few of them.
20110124035513.000|20110124035515.000|TR0|
20110124035515.000|20110124035518.000|TR0|LEMON:  The information you gave the FBI 
20110124035518.000|20110124035520.000|TR0|resulted in 50 convictions, I believe.  
20110124035520.000|20110124035523.000|TR0|So, will these recent busts, 127, will 
20110124035523.000|20110124035526.000|TR0|they actually hurt the Mafia or do you 
20110124035526.000|20110124035528.000|TR0|think that more guys will just step up and 
20110124035528.000|20110124035531.000|TR0|take their place?
20110124035531.000|20110124035533.000|TR0|
20110124035533.000|20110124035536.000|TR0|HILL:  I mean, absolutely.  I'm sure with 
20110124035536.000|20110124035539.000|TR0|the 127 they arrested, there's 249 people 
20110124035539.000|20110124035541.000|TR0|looking to take -- you know, take their 
20110124035541.000|20110124035544.000|TR0|positions over.  It's a thing -- they're 
20110124035544.000|20110124035546.000|TR0|not going -- the Mob is not going to go 
20110124035546.000|20110124035549.000|TR0|out of business.  As long as there is 
20110124035549.000|20110124035552.000|TR0|illegal gambling and legal gambling and 
20110124035552.000|20110124035554.000|TR0|labor rackets, they are going to survive.  
20110124035554.000|20110124035557.000|TR0|The Mob is going to survive.
20110124035557.000|20110124035559.000|TR0|
20110124035559.000|20110124035602.000|TR0|But they put a good dent in them, you 
20110124035602.000|20110124035605.000|TR0|know.  And now, they'll have a big 
20110124035605.000|20110124035607.000|TR0|headache for a long time.  You know, these 
20110124035607.000|20110124035610.000|TR0|guys that got arrested, and they've got a 
20110124035610.000|20110124035612.000|TR0|long, you know, a long road ahead of them, 
20110124035612.000|20110124035615.000|TR0|you know. But the government is right on 
20110124035615.000|20110124035618.000|TR0|top of them.  They're a lot more 
20110124035618.000|20110124035620.000|TR0|sophisticated today than they were in 
20110124035620.000|20110124035623.000|TR0|1980, when I -- when I went into the 
20110124035623.000|20110124035625.000|TR0|Witness Protection Program.  Didn't do a 
20110124035625.000|20110124035628.000|TR0|whole lot of them...

20110124035644.000|20110124035646.000|TR0|have you noticed, and you're not inside

20110124035649.000|20110124035651.000|TR0|it changed with these busts, so they 
20110124035651.000|20110124035654.000|TR0|slowly, you know, drip by drip dwindling 
20110124035654.000|20110124035657.000|TR0|down, organized crime?  Do you see a big 
20110124035657.000|20110124035659.000|TR0|change?  And do you see one day -- I'm 
20110124035659.000|20110124035702.000|TR0|sure we probably won't ever end it but do 
20110124035702.000|20110124035704.000|TR0|you see a big diminish in organized crime

20110124035710.000|20110124035712.000|TR0|HILL:  I don't think so.  I don't think 
20110124035712.000|20110124035715.000|TR0|so.  I mean, as long as there's an illegal 
20110124035715.000|20110124035718.000|TR0|dollar to make out, you know, for these 
20110124035718.000|20110124035720.000|TR0|guys to earn with -- the criminals are 
20110124035720.000|20110124035723.000|TR0|going to be there.  They don't want to -- 
20110124035723.000|20110124035725.000|TR0|they don't want to pick up a lunch pail 
20110124035725.000|20110124035728.000|TR0|and go to work.  You know, they want to 
20110124035728.000|20110124035731.000|TR0|live off, you know, the misery of other 
20110124035731.000|20110124035733.000|TR0|people and they're going to, you know.  
20110124035733.000|20110124035736.000|TR0|And as long as that exists, you know, 
20110124035736.000|20110124035738.000|TR0|there's a -- but they put a good dent in

20110124035851.000|20110124035854.000|TR0|have been filed in the 1987 kidnapping of 
20110124035854.000|20110124035856.000|TR0|a baby girl from a New York hospital.  The

20110124035859.000|20110124035902.000|TR0|herself in this morning.  Pettway 
20110124035902.000|20110124035904.000|TR0|allegedly snatched the infant 23 years ago 
20110124035904.000|20110124035907.000|TR0|and then raised the girl as her own
