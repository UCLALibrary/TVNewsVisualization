20110124200007.000|20110124200009.000|TR0|BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello, 
20110124200009.000|20110124200011.000|TR0|everyone.  I'm Brooke Baldwin.
20110124200011.000|20110124200014.000|TR0|
20110124200014.000|20110124200016.000|TR0|And here's what's -- what's going on this 
20110124200016.000|20110124200018.000|TR0|hour.  We are expecting the accused Tucson 
20110124200018.000|20110124200021.000|TR0|shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, to be in 
20110124200021.000|20110124200023.000|TR0|court.  We're there live as we await word 
20110124200023.000|20110124200025.000|TR0|from inside that federal courtroom.
20110124200025.000|20110124200028.000|TR0|
20110124200028.000|20110124200030.000|TR0|Also in court today, the woman who 
20110124200030.000|20110124200033.000|TR0|confessed to snatching a baby girl from a 
20110124200033.000|20110124200035.000|TR0|hospital 23 years ago.  This story, it has 
20110124200035.000|20110124200037.000|TR0|captivated all of us since that baby, now 
20110124200037.000|20110124200040.000|TR0|a grown woman, reunited with her birth 
20110124200040.000|20110124200042.000|TR0|family just last week.  We will get more 
20110124200042.000|20110124200044.000|TR0|on that in a moment.
20110124200044.000|20110124200047.000|TR0|
20110124200047.000|20110124200049.000|TR0|And we are getting more and more of these 
20110124200049.000|20110124200052.000|TR0|incredible images from inside an airport 
20110124200052.000|20110124200054.000|TR0|in Moscow, where that bomb blast killed 
20110124200054.000|20110124200056.000|TR0|dozens of people.  I will take you live to 
20110124200056.000|20110124200059.000|TR0|Moscow in a moment as well.
20110124200059.000|20110124200101.000|TR0|
20110124200101.000|20110124200103.000|TR0|But, first, let's get to this breaking 
20110124200103.000|20110124200106.000|TR0|news out of Chicago. Former White House 
20110124200106.000|20110124200108.000|TR0|Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has just 
20110124200108.000|20110124200111.000|TR0|responded to this court's decision to toss 
20110124200111.000|20110124200113.000|TR0|him off the ballot for mayor of Chicago.
20110124200113.000|20110124200115.000|TR0|
20110124200115.000|20110124200118.000|TR0|Here is Rahm Emanuel speaking just within 
20110124200118.000|20110124200120.000|TR0|the past half-hour.
20110124200120.000|20110124200122.000|TR0|
20110124200122.000|20110124200125.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110124200125.000|20110124200127.000|TR0|
20110124200127.000|20110124200130.000|TR0|RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO MAYORAL 
20110124200130.000|20110124200132.000|TR0|CANDIDATE:  I had answered the president's 
20110124200132.000|20110124200134.000|TR0|-- Obama's request to serve as his chief 
20110124200134.000|20110124200137.000|TR0|of staff.  I still own a home here, look 
20110124200137.000|20110124200139.000|TR0|forward to moving into it one day, vote 
20110124200139.000|20110124200141.000|TR0|from here, pay property taxes here.
20110124200141.000|20110124200144.000|TR0|
20110124200144.000|20110124200146.000|TR0|I do believe that the people of the city 
20110124200146.000|20110124200148.000|TR0|of Chicago deserve the right to make a 
20110124200148.000|20110124200151.000|TR0|decision of who they want to be their next 
20110124200151.000|20110124200153.000|TR0|mayor, which is everything that I contend 
20110124200153.000|20110124200156.000|TR0|since the beginning.  The board of 
20110124200156.000|20110124200158.000|TR0|election has agreed with that.
20110124200158.000|20110124200200.000|TR0|
20110124200200.000|20110124200203.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110124200203.000|20110124200205.000|TR0|
20110124200205.000|20110124200207.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  And there he was.
20110124200207.000|20110124200210.000|TR0|
20110124200210.000|20110124200212.000|TR0|Now to Jessica Yellin.
20110124200212.000|20110124200215.000|TR0|
20110124200215.000|20110124200217.000|TR0|Jessica, I know you have been reporting on 
20110124200217.000|20110124200219.000|TR0|this, our national political correspondent.
20110124200219.000|20110124200222.000|TR0|
20110124200222.000|20110124200224.000|TR0|He's obviously referring to his residency, 
20110124200224.000|20110124200226.000|TR0|which this federal court found lacking 
20110124200226.000|20110124200229.000|TR0|today.  We know the -- the election is 
20110124200229.000|20110124200231.000|TR0|next month.
20110124200231.000|20110124200234.000|TR0|
20110124200234.000|20110124200236.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110124200236.000|20110124200238.000|TR0|
20110124200238.000|20110124200241.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  So, Jess, does he challenge 
20110124200241.000|20110124200243.000|TR0|this?  What's his next step?
20110124200243.000|20110124200245.000|TR0|
20110124200245.000|20110124200248.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL 
20110124200248.000|20110124200250.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, definitely.
20110124200250.000|20110124200253.000|TR0|
20110124200253.000|20110124200255.000|TR0|So, a source close to the Emanuel campaign 
20110124200255.000|20110124200257.000|TR0|tells me that they had an appeal already 
20110124200257.000|20110124200300.000|TR0|written in case this should happen.  And 
20110124200300.000|20110124200302.000|TR0|that will be filed in an expedited way.  
20110124200302.000|20110124200304.000|TR0|Then they will ask the state Supreme Court 
20110124200304.000|20110124200307.000|TR0|to take this up again in an expedited way.
20110124200307.000|20110124200309.000|TR0|
20110124200309.000|20110124200311.000|TR0|And the bottom-line question is, did he 
20110124200311.000|20110124200314.000|TR0|abandon his residency there in Chicago?  
20110124200314.000|20110124200316.000|TR0|Folks close to the Emanuel campaign tell 
20110124200316.000|20110124200319.000|TR0|me they think they have a pretty -- a very 
20110124200319.000|20110124200321.000|TR0|good shot at getting this latest decision 
20110124200321.000|20110124200323.000|TR0|overturned because the election board 
20110124200323.000|20110124200326.000|TR0|unanimously sided with the Emanuel view 
20110124200326.000|20110124200328.000|TR0|that he did not abandon residency.  So did 
20110124200328.000|20110124200330.000|TR0|a lower court.
20110124200330.000|20110124200333.000|TR0|
20110124200333.000|20110124200335.000|TR0|And this actual court itself, its decision 
20110124200335.000|20110124200338.000|TR0|was divided, two against, but one -- one 
20110124200338.000|20110124200340.000|TR0|dissenter said, no, no, he had not 
20110124200340.000|20110124200342.000|TR0|abandoned residency.
20110124200342.000|20110124200345.000|TR0|
20110124200345.000|20110124200347.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Hmm.
20110124200347.000|20110124200349.000|TR0|
20110124200349.000|20110124200352.000|TR0|YELLIN:  So, they feel that they have a 
20110124200352.000|20110124200354.000|TR0|pretty strong argument going forward and 
20110124200354.000|20110124200357.000|TR0|that, in their view, this should be left 
20110124200357.000|20110124200359.000|TR0|to the voters to decide who should be 
20110124200359.000|20110124200401.000|TR0|their next mayor.
20110124200401.000|20110124200404.000|TR0|
20110124200404.000|20110124200406.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  We know you're following it.  
20110124200406.000|20110124200408.000|TR0|Let us know if there's any update, what 
20110124200408.000|20110124200411.000|TR0|you hear from there camp as well.
20110124200411.000|20110124200413.000|TR0|
20110124200413.000|20110124200416.000|TR0|Jess...
20110124200416.000|20110124200418.000|TR0|
20110124200418.000|20110124200420.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110124200420.000|20110124200423.000|TR0|
20110124200423.000|20110124200425.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  ... Yellin, we will see you any 
20110124200425.000|20110124200427.000|TR0|minute for -- for your normal hit talking 
20110124200427.000|20110124200430.000|TR0|about (INAUDIBLE) for tomorrow.
20110124200430.000|20110124200432.000|TR0|
20110124200432.000|20110124200434.000|TR0|But just a quick reminder again, any 
20110124200434.000|20110124200437.000|TR0|minute now, the suspect in that Tucson 
20110124200437.000|20110124200439.000|TR0|shooting rampage is scheduled to appear 
20110124200439.000|20110124200442.000|TR0|before a federal judge.  You know his name 
20110124200442.000|20110124200444.000|TR0|by now.  He is Jared Lee Loughner.  He 
20110124200444.000|20110124200446.000|TR0|will be asked to enter his plea, guilty or 
20110124200446.000|20110124200449.000|TR0|not guilty, on charges he tried to kill 
20110124200449.000|20110124200451.000|TR0|three people, including U.S. Congresswoman 
20110124200451.000|20110124200453.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.
20110124200453.000|20110124200456.000|TR0|
20110124200456.000|20110124200458.000|TR0|Ted Rowlands is live for us outside that 
20110124200458.000|20110124200501.000|TR0|federal courthouse there in Phoenix.
20110124200501.000|20110124200503.000|TR0|
20110124200503.000|20110124200505.000|TR0|And, Ted, just give me a quick rundown of 
20110124200505.000|20110124200508.000|TR0|what is expected to happen inside that 
20110124200508.000|20110124200510.000|TR0|courtroom today.
20110124200510.000|20110124200512.000|TR0|
20110124200512.000|20110124200515.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, 
20110124200515.000|20110124200517.000|TR0|Brooke, we're expecting a fairly short 
20110124200517.000|20110124200520.000|TR0|proceeding today, which gets under way in 
20110124200520.000|20110124200522.000|TR0|the next half- hour here.       Loughner 
20110124200522.000|20110124200524.000|TR0|will enter pleas, likely, on those three 
20110124200524.000|20110124200527.000|TR0|charges of attempted murder.  There are 
20110124200527.000|20110124200529.000|TR0|two other charges against him, but he 
20110124200529.000|20110124200531.000|TR0|hasn't been indicted yet by a federal 
20110124200531.000|20110124200534.000|TR0|grand jury, those murder charges, those 
20110124200534.000|20110124200536.000|TR0|other two.  So, he's just going to deal 
20110124200536.000|20110124200539.000|TR0|with, in terms of a plea, those three 
20110124200539.000|20110124200541.000|TR0|attempted murder charges.
20110124200541.000|20110124200543.000|TR0|
20110124200543.000|20110124200546.000|TR0|Then there's another thing on the docket, 
20110124200546.000|20110124200548.000|TR0|and that is a motion by the United States 
20110124200548.000|20110124200550.000|TR0|government to move any further proceedings 
20110124200550.000|20110124200553.000|TR0|out of Phoenix and to Tucson, to the 
20110124200553.000|20110124200555.000|TR0|federal courthouse of Tucson.  And the 
20110124200555.000|20110124200557.000|TR0|argument is that family members of the 
20110124200557.000|20110124200600.000|TR0|victims of these shootings want to be part 
20110124200600.000|20110124200602.000|TR0|of the process, and the government says 
20110124200602.000|20110124200605.000|TR0|they should not have to drive two hours 
20110124200605.000|20110124200607.000|TR0|each way to attend any of the court 
20110124200607.000|20110124200609.000|TR0|proceedings from here on out.
20110124200609.000|20110124200612.000|TR0|
20110124200612.000|20110124200614.000|TR0|We expect that those two things will be 
20110124200614.000|20110124200616.000|TR0|dealt with.  We will see what else is 
20110124200616.000|20110124200619.000|TR0|dealt with and we will see what kind of 
20110124200619.000|20110124200621.000|TR0|demeanor Loughner has this time around.  
20110124200621.000|20110124200624.000|TR0|In his first court appearance, he listened 
20110124200624.000|20110124200626.000|TR0|to everything the judge said and answered 
20110124200626.000|20110124200628.000|TR0|politely all of the questions that the 
20110124200628.000|20110124200631.000|TR0|judge had for him.
20110124200631.000|20110124200633.000|TR0|
20110124200633.000|20110124200635.000|TR0|There will be a new judge on the bench 
20110124200635.000|20110124200638.000|TR0|today.  They have brought in a U.S. 
20110124200638.000|20110124200640.000|TR0|district judge out of San Diego because 
20110124200640.000|20110124200643.000|TR0|all of the Arizona- based judges had been 
20110124200643.000|20110124200645.000|TR0|recused from this case.  We will see what 
20110124200645.000|20110124200647.000|TR0|Loughner does today in court.
20110124200647.000|20110124200650.000|TR0|
20110124200650.000|20110124200652.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Yes, you painted such a great 
20110124200652.000|20110124200654.000|TR0|picture, Ted, because I it was think 
20110124200654.000|20110124200657.000|TR0|January 10, when we first saw -- when you 
20110124200657.000|20110124200659.000|TR0|first saw Loughner in court.  So, we will 
20110124200659.000|20110124200702.000|TR0|be waiting for that description.
20110124200702.000|20110124200704.000|TR0|
20110124200704.000|20110124200706.000|TR0|You mentioned the prosecution trying to 
20110124200706.000|20110124200709.000|TR0|get this to move to Tucson.  Are there any 
20110124200709.000|20110124200711.000|TR0|witnesses or any family members of those 
20110124200711.000|20110124200713.000|TR0|wounded expected to be in the courtroom in 
20110124200713.000|20110124200716.000|TR0|Phoenix for today's hearing?
20110124200716.000|20110124200718.000|TR0|
20110124200718.000|20110124200720.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  We haven't seen any evidence of 
20110124200720.000|20110124200723.000|TR0|it in terms of people coming into the 
20110124200723.000|20110124200725.000|TR0|courthouse.  It doesn't mean that there 
20110124200725.000|20110124200728.000|TR0|aren't family members inside the building 
20110124200728.000|20110124200730.000|TR0|now.
20110124200730.000|20110124200732.000|TR0|
20110124200732.000|20110124200735.000|TR0|We haven't seen anybody yet.  Once we're 
20110124200735.000|20110124200737.000|TR0|in the courtroom itself, we will be able 
20110124200737.000|20110124200739.000|TR0|to distinguish who's who.  It's pretty 
20110124200739.000|20110124200742.000|TR0|easy to tell a reporter from a family 
20110124200742.000|20110124200744.000|TR0|member...
20110124200744.000|20110124200747.000|TR0|
20110124200747.000|20110124200749.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Sure.
20110124200749.000|20110124200751.000|TR0|
20110124200751.000|20110124200754.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  ... with a stake in a trial.  
20110124200754.000|20110124200756.000|TR0|And obviously everybody will be looking 
20110124200756.000|20110124200758.000|TR0|for that to see if anybody did make that 
20110124200758.000|20110124200801.000|TR0|drive from Tucson.
20110124200801.000|20110124200803.000|TR0|
20110124200803.000|20110124200806.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  So, I know this is when he 
20110124200806.000|20110124200808.000|TR0|enters his plea.  Will we also get a trial 
20110124200808.000|20110124200810.000|TR0|date, Ted?
20110124200810.000|20110124200813.000|TR0|
20110124200813.000|20110124200815.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Likely, we will get a trial 
20110124200815.000|20110124200817.000|TR0|date, which will be set as sort of a 
20110124200817.000|20110124200820.000|TR0|benchmark.  But whatever date is set, it 
20110124200820.000|20110124200822.000|TR0|likely will be pushed back.
20110124200822.000|20110124200825.000|TR0|
20110124200825.000|20110124200827.000|TR0|Loughner does have the right to a speedy 
20110124200827.000|20110124200829.000|TR0|trial, however.  And, although very 
20110124200829.000|20110124200832.000|TR0|doubtful, he could say that he wants to go 
20110124200832.000|20110124200834.000|TR0|on trial immediately -- well, within 60 
20110124200834.000|20110124200836.000|TR0|days.  And if that's the case, a trial 
20110124200836.000|20110124200839.000|TR0|date will be set within this period.  He 
20110124200839.000|20110124200841.000|TR0|may also -- likely will also be given the 
20110124200841.000|20110124200843.000|TR0|opportunity to waive time.
20110124200843.000|20110124200846.000|TR0|
20110124200846.000|20110124200848.000|TR0|If he does that, that will extend the 
20110124200848.000|20110124200851.000|TR0|availability for trial dates out into the 
20110124200851.000|20110124200853.000|TR0|next calendar year or so.  But this judge 
20110124200853.000|20110124200855.000|TR0|that is now on the bench, he has a 
20110124200855.000|20110124200858.000|TR0|reputation of moving things along.  So, it 
20110124200858.000|20110124200900.000|TR0|will be interesting to see how quickly he 
20110124200900.000|20110124200902.000|TR0|wants a trial date set and to get Loughner 
20110124200902.000|20110124200905.000|TR0|through the system.
20110124200905.000|20110124200907.000|TR0|
20110124200907.000|20110124200910.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  That's interesting.  Well, I 
20110124200910.000|20110124200912.000|TR0|know our cameras don't -- can't go inside 
20110124200912.000|20110124200914.000|TR0|that courtroom, but I know you can.  So, 
20110124200914.000|20110124200917.000|TR0|I'm going to let you go.  Go ahead.  And, 
20110124200917.000|20110124200919.000|TR0|Ted, we will see you on TV hopefully in 
20110124200919.000|20110124200921.000|TR0|the next half-hour with the description on 
20110124200921.000|20110124200924.000|TR0|this particular arraignment.
20110124200924.000|20110124200926.000|TR0|
20110124200926.000|20110124200929.000|TR0|Ted Rowlands for me in Phoenix -- thank 
20110124200929.000|20110124200931.000|TR0|you, Ted.
20110124200931.000|20110124200933.000|TR0|
20110124200933.000|20110124200936.000|TR0|And the president of Russia is convinced 
20110124200936.000|20110124200938.000|TR0|it is a terrorist act. I want you to take 
20110124200938.000|20110124200940.000|TR0|a look at this, total chaos, panic.  You 
20110124200940.000|20110124200943.000|TR0|see a lot of smoke as well, debris, dead 
20110124200943.000|20110124200945.000|TR0|and injured people there just on the 
20110124200945.000|20110124200948.000|TR0|floor.  This is Moscow's busiest 
20110124200948.000|20110124200950.000|TR0|international airport.
20110124200950.000|20110124200952.000|TR0|
20110124200952.000|20110124200955.000|TR0|Here's what officials are saying.  They 
20110124200955.000|20110124200957.000|TR0|say a suicide bomber blew him or I should 
20110124200957.000|20110124200959.000|TR0|say her self up -- we don't know yet -- 
20110124200959.000|20110124201002.000|TR0|inside the arrivals hall of the airport 
20110124201002.000|20110124201004.000|TR0|right around 4:30 in the afternoon Moscow 
20110124201004.000|20110124201006.000|TR0|time, when the terminal was packed with 
20110124201006.000|20110124201009.000|TR0|travelers.
20110124201009.000|20110124201011.000|TR0|
20110124201011.000|20110124201014.000|TR0|We have casualty figures.  And I want to 
20110124201014.000|20110124201016.000|TR0|tell you, they are high. What we don't 
20110124201016.000|20110124201018.000|TR0|have yet is who may have done this and why.
20110124201018.000|20110124201021.000|TR0|
20110124201021.000|20110124201023.000|TR0|I want to go straight to Moscow now and 
20110124201023.000|20110124201025.000|TR0|CNN senior international correspondent 
20110124201025.000|20110124201028.000|TR0|Matthew Chance.
20110124201028.000|20110124201030.000|TR0|
20110124201030.000|20110124201033.000|TR0|And, Matthew, what are you learning?  And 
20110124201033.000|20110124201035.000|TR0|-- and just to ask once again, has there 
20110124201035.000|20110124201037.000|TR0|been any claim of responsibility yet?
20110124201037.000|20110124201040.000|TR0|
20110124201040.000|20110124201042.000|TR0|MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL 
20110124201042.000|20110124201044.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Brooke, no, there hasn't 
20110124201044.000|20110124201047.000|TR0|been a claim of responsibility yet, but 
20110124201047.000|20110124201049.000|TR0|clearly the finger of suspicion is 
20110124201049.000|20110124201052.000|TR0|pointing at separatists, insurgents, 
20110124201052.000|20110124201054.000|TR0|Islamists from the North Caucasus region 
20110124201054.000|20110124201056.000|TR0|of Russia, particularly from Chechnya and 
20110124201056.000|20110124201059.000|TR0|Dagestan and places like that that have 
20110124201059.000|20110124201101.000|TR0|experienced terrible Islamist insurgency 
20110124201101.000|20110124201103.000|TR0|over the past decade or more against the 
20110124201103.000|20110124201106.000|TR0|Russian state.
20110124201106.000|20110124201108.000|TR0|
20110124201108.000|20110124201111.000|TR0|The militants there want an independent 
20110124201111.000|20110124201113.000|TR0|Islamic state in that part of Southern 
20110124201113.000|20110124201115.000|TR0|Russia.  In terms of the investigation, 
20110124201115.000|20110124201118.000|TR0|I'm standing here at Domodedovo Airport.  
20110124201118.000|20110124201120.000|TR0|It's freezing cold outside.  Inside, the 
20110124201120.000|20110124201122.000|TR0|authorities, the police have declared the 
20110124201122.000|20110124201125.000|TR0|area a crime scene, where the explosion 
20110124201125.000|20110124201127.000|TR0|took place.
20110124201127.000|20110124201129.000|TR0|
20110124201129.000|20110124201132.000|TR0|And, so, we're not being permitted to get 
20110124201132.000|20110124201134.000|TR0|into it.  There's not a lot of information 
20110124201134.000|20110124201137.000|TR0|coming out either.  But what we do know is 
20110124201137.000|20110124201139.000|TR0|that -- according to the Interfax news 
20110124201139.000|20110124201141.000|TR0|agency at least, is that parts of the body 
20110124201141.000|20110124201144.000|TR0|the investigators believe is the body of 
20110124201144.000|20110124201146.000|TR0|the suicide bomber have been identified by 
20110124201146.000|20110124201148.000|TR0|the investigators.       BALDWIN:  Hmm.
20110124201148.000|20110124201151.000|TR0|
20110124201151.000|20110124201153.000|TR0|CHANCE: We understand that the explosives 
20110124201153.000|20110124201156.000|TR0|used to cause such devastation are about 
20110124201156.000|20110124201158.000|TR0|five kilograms of -- of high explosives, 
20110124201158.000|20110124201200.000|TR0|apparently strapped to the body of that 
20110124201200.000|20110124201203.000|TR0|suicide bomber.
20110124201203.000|20110124201205.000|TR0|
20110124201205.000|20110124201207.000|TR0|And this is unconfirmed at the moment, but 
20110124201207.000|20110124201210.000|TR0|we're hearing that there may have been 
20110124201210.000|20110124201212.000|TR0|foreign nationals who number among the 35 
20110124201212.000|20110124201215.000|TR0|people who are confirmed dead.  It's being 
20110124201215.000|20110124201217.000|TR0|reported in Russian news agencies that one 
20110124201217.000|20110124201219.000|TR0|of the dead may be from Britain.
20110124201219.000|20110124201222.000|TR0|
20110124201222.000|20110124201224.000|TR0|There may be other foreign nationals as 
20110124201224.000|20110124201226.000|TR0|well.  And that's hardly surprising, 
20110124201226.000|20110124201229.000|TR0|Brooke, given that this is the main 
20110124201229.000|20110124201231.000|TR0|airport through which people come in and 
20110124201231.000|20110124201234.000|TR0|out of Russia from overseas.  And, so, 
20110124201234.000|20110124201236.000|TR0|we're expecting, hoping to get more 
20110124201236.000|20110124201238.000|TR0|clarity on this in the hours ahead.
20110124201238.000|20110124201241.000|TR0|
20110124201241.000|20110124201243.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  And, Matthew, I know that the 
20110124201243.000|20110124201245.000|TR0|numbers and the information is still sort 
20110124201245.000|20110124201248.000|TR0|of coming in, but -- but let me just point 
20110124201248.000|20110124201250.000|TR0|out the last terror attack in Moscow -- 
20110124201250.000|20110124201253.000|TR0|you mentioned Dagestan rebels -- was last 
20110124201253.000|20110124201255.000|TR0|March, subway bombers claimed by Dagestan 
20110124201255.000|20110124201257.000|TR0|rebels.  Back in 2004, two suicide 
20110124201257.000|20110124201300.000|TR0|bombers, also women, boarded planes.  At 
20110124201300.000|20110124201302.000|TR0|this airport, Chechen killed -- killed 
20110124201302.000|20110124201304.000|TR0|nearly 90 people.
20110124201304.000|20110124201307.000|TR0|
20110124201307.000|20110124201309.000|TR0|So, given -- given the history there, is 
20110124201309.000|20110124201311.000|TR0|there any -- any sort of signature today, 
20110124201311.000|20110124201314.000|TR0|Matthew, following any sort of pattern?
20110124201314.000|20110124201316.000|TR0|
20110124201316.000|20110124201319.000|TR0|CHANCE:  Well, I mean -- I mean, clearly, 
20110124201319.000|20110124201321.000|TR0|these suicide bomb attacks that have 
20110124201321.000|20110124201323.000|TR0|affected Russia so badly over the past 
20110124201323.000|20110124201326.000|TR0|decade or so all have one thing in common, 
20110124201326.000|20110124201328.000|TR0|which is that they emanate from this very 
20110124201328.000|20110124201330.000|TR0|unstable region of Southern Russia, where 
20110124201330.000|20110124201333.000|TR0|there is that insurgency under way, 
20110124201333.000|20110124201335.000|TR0|whether it's Chechnya, whether it's 
20110124201335.000|20110124201338.000|TR0|Dagestan, Ingushetia, or any of the other 
20110124201338.000|20110124201340.000|TR0|republics in that part of Chechnya.
20110124201340.000|20110124201342.000|TR0|
20110124201342.000|20110124201345.000|TR0|One thing is -- they have in common, which 
20110124201345.000|20110124201347.000|TR0|is that these suicide bombers are trained 
20110124201347.000|20110124201349.000|TR0|and they -- they often come from down 
20110124201349.000|20110124201352.000|TR0|there, and responsibility is usually 
20110124201352.000|20110124201354.000|TR0|claimed by groups that base themselves in 
20110124201354.000|20110124201357.000|TR0|that region.
20110124201357.000|20110124201359.000|TR0|
20110124201359.000|20110124201401.000|TR0|And -- and I'm positive...
20110124201401.000|20110124201404.000|TR0|
20110124201404.000|20110124201406.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  I see.  I see.
20110124201406.000|20110124201408.000|TR0|
20110124201408.000|20110124201411.000|TR0|CHANCE:  ... that that's where the focus 
20110124201411.000|20110124201413.000|TR0|of the Russian security forces is right 
20110124201413.000|20110124201416.000|TR0|now...
20110124201416.000|20110124201418.000|TR0|
20110124201418.000|20110124201420.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  OK.

20110124201423.000|20110124201425.000|TR0|CHANCE:  ... to try and find those 
20110124201425.000|20110124201427.000|TR0|responsible for this in that region.
20110124201427.000|20110124201430.000|TR0|
20110124201430.000|20110124201432.000|TR0|Indeed, that's what the Russian president 
20110124201432.000|20110124201434.000|TR0|-- president has said will happen now.  
20110124201434.000|20110124201437.000|TR0|He's gone on national television vowing to 
20110124201437.000|20110124201439.000|TR0|track down, in his words, those 
20110124201439.000|20110124201442.000|TR0|responsible for the carnage here at 
20110124201442.000|20110124201444.000|TR0|Moscow's main airport.
20110124201444.000|20110124201446.000|TR0|
20110124201446.000|20110124201449.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Matthew Chance, we're going to 
20110124201449.000|20110124201451.000|TR0|check in with you within the next hour.  I 
20110124201451.000|20110124201453.000|TR0|have a feeling you're going to get some 
20110124201453.000|20110124201456.000|TR0|more numbers, more information.  So, we 
20110124201456.000|20110124201458.000|TR0|look forward to that from Moscow. Matthew, 
20110124201458.000|20110124201501.000|TR0|thanks.

20110124201602.000|20110124201605.000|TR0|alleged motive behind that baby kidnapping 
20110124201605.000|20110124201607.000|TR0|that came to a stunning end when the 
20110124201607.000|20110124201609.000|TR0|victim became a little suspicious and 
20110124201609.000|20110124201612.000|TR0|solved the case all on her own.

20110124201619.000|20110124201621.000|TR0|charges she snatched White from a New York 
20110124201621.000|20110124201624.000|TR0|City hospital in Harlem back in 1987.

20110124201626.000|20110124201628.000|TR0|Her name is Ann Pettway.  She turned

20110124201631.000|20110124201633.000|TR0|And papers filed today in federal court 
20110124201633.000|20110124201635.000|TR0|indicate she answered the one question 
20110124201635.000|20110124201638.000|TR0|everyone is asking:  Why?

20110124201659.000|20110124201702.000|TR0|again, I would probably answer some of her 
20110124201702.000|20110124201704.000|TR0|questions -- or ask her some more 
20110124201704.000|20110124201706.000|TR0|questions, but why?  Why you do this to me

20110124201728.000|20110124201730.000|TR0|those papers filed in New York.  Why does 
20110124201730.000|20110124201732.000|TR0|she say she does -- did this?

20110124201737.000|20110124201739.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, according to these 
20110124201739.000|20110124201742.000|TR0|court papers, she allegedly told the FBI 
20110124201742.000|20110124201744.000|TR0|that she snatched the baby from the 
20110124201744.000|20110124201747.000|TR0|hospital back in 1987 because she so badly 
20110124201747.000|20110124201749.000|TR0|wanted to be a mother herself because she 
20110124201749.000|20110124201751.000|TR0|had suffered a number of miscarriages.
20110124201751.000|20110124201754.000|TR0|
20110124201754.000|20110124201756.000|TR0|So, the shocking thing, really, that we 
20110124201756.000|20110124201758.000|TR0|learned from the papers today is that, 
20110124201758.000|20110124201801.000|TR0|according to the FBI, she has confessed to 
20110124201801.000|20110124201803.000|TR0|kidnapping that baby, snatching that baby 
20110124201803.000|20110124201806.000|TR0|so many years ago.
20110124201806.000|20110124201808.000|TR0|
20110124201808.000|20110124201810.000|TR0|And the FBI says that she said that she 
20110124201810.000|20110124201813.000|TR0|was sorry about it.  She said Pettway -- 
20110124201813.000|20110124201815.000|TR0|they said that Pettway is truly sorry and 
20110124201815.000|20110124201817.000|TR0|that she said what she did is totally 
20110124201817.000|20110124201820.000|TR0|unacceptable and added the following -- 
20110124201820.000|20110124201822.000|TR0|quote -- that she is sorry and knows that 
20110124201822.000|20110124201825.000|TR0|she has caused a lot of pain.
20110124201825.000|20110124201827.000|TR0|

20110124201832.000|20110124201834.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  So, right now, we're waiting 
20110124201834.000|20110124201836.000|TR0|for her to make her very first -- first 
20110124201836.000|20110124201839.000|TR0|court appearance today.  And we will have 
20110124201839.000|20110124201841.000|TR0|to find out whether it will turn into more 
20110124201841.000|20110124201843.000|TR0|than that.
20110124201843.000|20110124201846.000|TR0|
20110124201846.000|20110124201848.000|TR0|If, indeed, she really has confessed to 
20110124201848.000|20110124201851.000|TR0|this, could she now be meeting behind 
20110124201851.000|20110124201853.000|TR0|closed doors with her lawyer, and might 
20110124201853.000|20110124201855.000|TR0|she be prepared to enter a plea...
20110124201855.000|20110124201858.000|TR0|
20110124201858.000|20110124201900.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Hmm.
20110124201900.000|20110124201902.000|TR0|
20110124201902.000|20110124201905.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  ... at -- at some time in the 
20110124201905.000|20110124201907.000|TR0|future, if not today? Perhaps the judge 
20110124201907.000|20110124201910.000|TR0|will be able to walk us through all this, 
20110124201910.000|20110124201912.000|TR0|or will her defense attorney challenge the 
20110124201912.000|20110124201914.000|TR0|statements that she allegedly made to the 
20110124201914.000|20110124201917.000|TR0|FBI?  We will have to see.
20110124201917.000|20110124201919.000|TR0|
20110124201919.000|20110124201921.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Well, what about this, Susan, as 
20110124201921.000|20110124201924.000|TR0|-- as we're waiting for her -- her hearing 
20110124201924.000|20110124201926.000|TR0|to get under way?
20110124201926.000|20110124201929.000|TR0|
20110124201929.000|20110124201931.000|TR0|Over the course of the last couple of 
20110124201931.000|20110124201933.000|TR0|days, we know Pettway was spotted over the 
20110124201933.000|20110124201936.000|TR0|weekend.  I want you to tell me about 
20110124201936.000|20110124201938.000|TR0|that, where was she, who -- who spotted 
20110124201938.000|20110124201940.000|TR0|her, and how she ultimately turned herself 
20110124201940.000|20110124201943.000|TR0|in this.
20110124201943.000|20110124201945.000|TR0|
20110124201945.000|20110124201948.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  Well, certainly, it was a big 
20110124201948.000|20110124201950.000|TR0|break in the case when she was spotted on 
20110124201950.000|20110124201952.000|TR0|Saturday at a pawn shop in Bridgeport, 
20110124201952.000|20110124201955.000|TR0|Connecticut. She has a lot of family 
20110124201955.000|20110124201957.000|TR0|there.  And, up until that time, no one 
20110124201957.000|20110124201959.000|TR0|really knew where she was.
20110124201959.000|20110124202002.000|TR0|
20110124202002.000|20110124202004.000|TR0|The store employee thought that he 
20110124202004.000|20110124202006.000|TR0|recognized her from media reports, but she 
20110124202006.000|20110124202009.000|TR0|was in and out quickly, after trying to 
20110124202009.000|20110124202011.000|TR0|sell some jewelry, didn't like the price, 
20110124202011.000|20110124202014.000|TR0|and she left.  But that employee contacted 
20110124202014.000|20110124202016.000|TR0|police.  They looked at the surveillance 
20110124202016.000|20110124202018.000|TR0|video, confirmed it was her.
20110124202018.000|20110124202021.000|TR0|
20110124202021.000|20110124202023.000|TR0|And then, the next day, a law enforcement 
20110124202023.000|20110124202025.000|TR0|source tells me that Pettway contacted a 
20110124202025.000|20110124202028.000|TR0|member of the Bridgeport, Connecticut, 
20110124202028.000|20110124202030.000|TR0|Police Department through that person's 
20110124202030.000|20110124202033.000|TR0|Facebook page because she knew that 
20110124202033.000|20110124202035.000|TR0|officer.  And, in fact, that's when the 
20110124202035.000|20110124202037.000|TR0|arrangement was made for her to turn 
20110124202037.000|20110124202040.000|TR0|herself in to the FBI on Sunday.
20110124202040.000|20110124202042.000|TR0|
20110124202042.000|20110124202044.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Through Facebook, how about 
20110124202044.000|20110124202047.000|TR0|that, Susan Candiotti?
20110124202047.000|20110124202049.000|TR0|
20110124202049.000|20110124202052.000|TR0|Let us know -- keep us posted on that 
20110124202052.000|20110124202054.000|TR0|hearing and let us know if she does enter 
20110124202054.000|20110124202056.000|TR0|a plea.  We will be waiting and watching.
20110124202056.000|20110124202059.000|TR0|
20110124202059.000|20110124202101.000|TR0|Susan, thank you.
20110124202101.000|20110124202103.000|TR0|
20110124202103.000|20110124202106.000|TR0|And, as President Obama gets ready for 
20110124202106.000|20110124202108.000|TR0|tomorrow's big State of the Union address, 
20110124202108.000|20110124202111.000|TR0|his approval rating hits its highest level 
20110124202111.000|20110124202113.000|TR0|in more than a year.  We're going to take 
20110124202113.000|20110124202115.000|TR0|a closer look at that next.

20110124202122.000|20110124202125.000|TR0|has -- well -- just wait for it.  If you 
20110124202125.000|20110124202127.000|TR0|haven't heard, we will tell you coming up.

20110124202134.000|20110124202137.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Former Senator George Allen back 
20110124202137.000|20110124202139.000|TR0|in the game.  Allen announced today that 
20110124202139.000|20110124202141.000|TR0|he will be running for his old Senate 
20110124202141.000|20110124202144.000|TR0|seat, same seat he lost just about six 
20110124202144.000|20110124202146.000|TR0|years ago, due in large part to this 
20110124202146.000|20110124202148.000|TR0|remark on the campaign trail in Virginia.

20110124202207.000|20110124202210.000|TR0|he's with my opponent.  And he's following

20110124202231.000|20110124202234.000|TR0|out to be an obscure racial slur.  
20110124202234.000|20110124202236.000|TR0|Republican Allen claimed he had never 
20110124202236.000|20110124202238.000|TR0|heard of it, just made it up himself.

20110124202241.000|20110124202243.000|TR0|And now something we actually touched on 
20110124202243.000|20110124202245.000|TR0|Friday: the president's new embrace of 
20110124202245.000|20110124202248.000|TR0|Ronald Reagan.  As if on cue today, 
20110124202248.000|20110124202250.000|TR0|President Obama has penned a tribute to, 
20110124202250.000|20110124202252.000|TR0|yes, the Gipper.

20110124202307.000|20110124202309.000|TR0|This is what the president -- quote -- "He

20110124202423.000|20110124202425.000|TR0|periodically.  And I -- it's not 
20110124202425.000|20110124202427.000|TR0|surprising that he would do so right now, 
20110124202427.000|20110124202430.000|TR0|as he's trying to reach out to center and 
20110124202430.000|20110124202432.000|TR0|moderate Republicans and at the 100-year

20110124202442.000|20110124202444.000|TR0|have been paying off.  The president's

20110124202446.000|20110124202449.000|TR0|50 percent.  It's at 55 percent -- that is 
20110124202449.000|20110124202451.000|TR0|great news inside the White House -- and 
20110124202451.000|20110124202453.000|TR0|up from 48 percent in December, an 
20110124202453.000|20110124202456.000|TR0|incredible climb in a short period of time.
20110124202456.000|20110124202458.000|TR0|
20110124202458.000|20110124202501.000|TR0|So, because I knew you were going to ask 
20110124202501.000|20110124202503.000|TR0|me about Reagan, I...
20110124202503.000|20110124202505.000|TR0|
20110124202505.000|20110124202508.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110124202508.000|20110124202510.000|TR0|
20110124202510.000|20110124202512.000|TR0|YELLIN:  ... looked at how he compares to 
20110124202512.000|20110124202515.000|TR0|the president he so reveres, Ronald Reagan.
20110124202515.000|20110124202517.000|TR0|
20110124202517.000|20110124202520.000|TR0|OK.  A lot of people don't remember this.  
20110124202520.000|20110124202522.000|TR0|That's the graph of Reagan's approval 
20110124202522.000|20110124202524.000|TR0|during his first two years.  Now, you 
20110124202524.000|20110124202527.000|TR0|might not remember he became that 
20110124202527.000|20110124202529.000|TR0|unpopular.  He started out at 55 percent 
20110124202529.000|20110124202531.000|TR0|in February of 1981, but, by January of 
20110124202531.000|20110124202534.000|TR0|'83, about this point in, he...
20110124202534.000|20110124202536.000|TR0|
20110124202536.000|20110124202539.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Mm-hmm.
20110124202539.000|20110124202541.000|TR0|
20110124202541.000|20110124202543.000|TR0|YELLIN:  ... was down to 35 percent.
20110124202543.000|20110124202546.000|TR0|
20110124202546.000|20110124202548.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Thirty-five...
20110124202548.000|20110124202550.000|TR0|
20110124202550.000|20110124202553.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110124202553.000|20110124202555.000|TR0|
20110124202555.000|20110124202557.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Yes.
20110124202557.000|20110124202600.000|TR0|
20110124202600.000|20110124202602.000|TR0|So we did an overview of -- looked at 
20110124202602.000|20110124202605.000|TR0|Obama's approval ratings. That's President 
20110124202605.000|20110124202607.000|TR0|Obama.  He started out 76 percent, went 
20110124202607.000|20110124202609.000|TR0|down, and now up to 55 percent.  But we 
20110124202609.000|20110124202612.000|TR0|overlaid the two, and...
20110124202612.000|20110124202614.000|TR0|
20110124202614.000|20110124202616.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Hmm.
20110124202616.000|20110124202619.000|TR0|
20110124202619.000|20110124202621.000|TR0|YELLIN:  ... you can see how the two sort 
20110124202621.000|20110124202624.000|TR0|of match a little bit. Reagan went down.  
20110124202624.000|20110124202626.000|TR0|And then, right after this point, Reagan 
20110124202626.000|20110124202628.000|TR0|started coming back up.  So there are some 
20110124202628.000|20110124202631.000|TR0|parallels there, a lot having to do with 
20110124202631.000|20110124202633.000|TR0|the economy in Reagan's case, too.       
20110124202633.000|20110124202635.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  So, back on Reagan, though, 
20110124202635.000|20110124202638.000|TR0|perhaps Reagan would be rolling in his 
20110124202638.000|20110124202640.000|TR0|grave if he heard the president speaking 
20110124202640.000|20110124202643.000|TR0|tomorrow night, because we know that Obama 
20110124202643.000|20110124202645.000|TR0|is going to call for more, not less, more 
20110124202645.000|20110124202647.000|TR0|government spending.  In fact, it's being 
20110124202647.000|20110124202650.000|TR0|suggested we might hear something like 
20110124202650.000|20110124202652.000|TR0|this.  Listen.

20110124202657.000|20110124202659.000|TR0|
20110124202659.000|20110124202702.000|TR0|OBAMA:  The investments I have talked 
20110124202702.000|20110124202704.000|TR0|about in education and innovation and 
20110124202704.000|20110124202706.000|TR0|infrastructure have historically commanded 
20110124202706.000|20110124202709.000|TR0|the support from both Democrats and 
20110124202709.000|20110124202711.000|TR0|Republicans.
20110124202711.000|20110124202713.000|TR0|
20110124202713.000|20110124202716.000|TR0|It was Abraham Lincoln who launched the 
20110124202716.000|20110124202718.000|TR0|Transcontinental Railroad and opened the 
20110124202718.000|20110124202720.000|TR0|National Academy of Sciences.  He did it 
20110124202720.000|20110124202723.000|TR0|in the middle of a war, by the way.  
20110124202723.000|20110124202725.000|TR0|Dwight Eisenhower helped build our 
20110124202725.000|20110124202728.000|TR0|highways. Republican members of Congress 
20110124202728.000|20110124202730.000|TR0|worked with FDR to pass the G.I. Bill.
20110124202730.000|20110124202732.000|TR0|
20110124202732.000|20110124202735.000|TR0|So, the point is, there should not be any 
20110124202735.000|20110124202737.000|TR0|inherent ideological differences that 
20110124202737.000|20110124202739.000|TR0|prevent Democrats and Republicans from 
20110124202739.000|20110124202742.000|TR0|making our economy more competitive with

20110124202751.000|20110124202754.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  So, Jess, since a lot of 
20110124202754.000|20110124202756.000|TR0|people's ears perk when they hear 
20110124202756.000|20110124202758.000|TR0|"government spending," do we know 
20110124202758.000|20110124202801.000|TR0|specifics, what kind of spending he's 
20110124202801.000|20110124202803.000|TR0|going to propose?
20110124202803.000|20110124202806.000|TR0|
20110124202806.000|20110124202808.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Well, broadly speaking, you would 
20110124202808.000|20110124202810.000|TR0|expect him to speak about infrastructure 
20110124202810.000|20110124202813.000|TR0|spending, like high-speed rail.  This is 
20110124202813.000|20110124202815.000|TR0|what we have been given reason to believe 
20110124202815.000|20110124202817.000|TR0|we should expect, spending on education, 
20110124202817.000|20110124202820.000|TR0|spending on things like green jobs and 
20110124202820.000|20110124202822.000|TR0|energy.
20110124202822.000|20110124202825.000|TR0|
20110124202825.000|20110124202827.000|TR0|But they call it investment, which is, 
20110124202827.000|20110124202829.000|TR0|they say, a proper role of government.  Of 
20110124202829.000|20110124202832.000|TR0|course, in this environment, Republicans 
20110124202832.000|20110124202834.000|TR0|say they won't hear of it.

20110124202855.000|20110124202858.000|TR0|LEADER:  With all due respect to our 
20110124202858.000|20110124202900.000|TR0|Democratic friends, any time they want to 
20110124202900.000|20110124202902.000|TR0|spend, they call it investment.  So, I 
20110124202902.000|20110124202905.000|TR0|think you will hear the president talk 
20110124202905.000|20110124202907.000|TR0|about investing a lot Tuesday night.

20110124202914.000|20110124202917.000|TR0|is not a time to be looking at pumping up

20110124202929.000|20110124202931.000|TR0|the line on spending is a key mandate for 
20110124202931.000|20110124202933.000|TR0|Republicans right now.

20110124202936.000|20110124202938.000|TR0|But I will tell you that some Republicans 
20110124202938.000|20110124202940.000|TR0|outside elected office, you know, 
20110124202940.000|20110124202943.000|TR0|advisers, confessed to me they worry that 
20110124202943.000|20110124202945.000|TR0|the party does risk ceding ground on sort 
20110124202945.000|20110124202948.000|TR0|of the optimism, excitement about the 
20110124202948.000|20110124202950.000|TR0|future to the president if the GOP doesn't 
20110124202950.000|20110124202952.000|TR0|get on board any kind of investment agenda.

20110124203103.000|20110124203106.000|TR0|now we are expecting 22-year-old Jared Lee 
20110124203106.000|20110124203108.000|TR0|Loughner to arrive to face more charges 
20110124203108.000|20110124203111.000|TR0|here for his alleged role in that shooting 
20110124203111.000|20110124203113.000|TR0|that killed six people and critically 
20110124203113.000|20110124203115.000|TR0|injured Congresswoman Giffords -- more on

20110124203125.000|20110124203127.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Just a reminder:  We are 
20110124203127.000|20110124203129.000|TR0|watching and waiting for the alleged 
20110124203129.000|20110124203132.000|TR0|shooting suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, to 
20110124203132.000|20110124203134.000|TR0|appear inside that Phoenix federal 
20110124203134.000|20110124203137.000|TR0|courthouse.  These are live pictures.  He 
20110124203137.000|20110124203139.000|TR0|is there. He's going to be arraigned on 
20110124203139.000|20110124203141.000|TR0|those three counts of attempted 
20110124203141.000|20110124203144.000|TR0|assassination and attempted murder in that 
20110124203144.000|20110124203146.000|TR0|U.S. district court in Phoenix before 
20110124203146.000|20110124203148.000|TR0|District Judge Larry Burns.

20110124203151.000|20110124203153.000|TR0|Keep in mind, a lot of those -- or, 
20110124203153.000|20110124203156.000|TR0|actually, all of those Arizona federal 
20110124203156.000|20110124203158.000|TR0|judges recused themselves because their 
20110124203158.000|20110124203200.000|TR0|colleague, federal Judge John Roll, who 
20110124203200.000|20110124203203.000|TR0|was shot and killed in those shootings, 
20110124203203.000|20110124203205.000|TR0|because of that connection.  So, it's 
20110124203205.000|20110124203207.000|TR0|actually a judge who came in from San 
20110124203207.000|20110124203210.000|TR0|Diego.

20110124203217.000|20110124203219.000|TR0|how that court appearance went.

20110124203222.000|20110124203224.000|TR0|Moving on here, talking about Oprah.  
20110124203224.000|20110124203226.000|TR0|There was quite an announcement today.  
20110124203226.000|20110124203229.000|TR0|Oprah has been saying for days and days 
20110124203229.000|20110124203231.000|TR0|she has this big, big announcement.  And, 
20110124203231.000|20110124203234.000|TR0|today, she made it.  The queen of daytime 
20110124203234.000|20110124203236.000|TR0|talk has a half-sister, a half-sister she 
20110124203236.000|20110124203238.000|TR0|apparently knew nothing about.
20110124203238.000|20110124203241.000|TR0|
20110124203241.000|20110124203243.000|TR0|Oprah told her TV audience today that her 
20110124203243.000|20110124203245.000|TR0|mother had kept a secret from her, that 
20110124203245.000|20110124203248.000|TR0|she had had another baby girl and had put 
20110124203248.000|20110124203250.000|TR0|her up for adoption.  Winfrey says she 
20110124203250.000|20110124203252.000|TR0|chose to wait to announce this family 
20110124203252.000|20110124203255.000|TR0|development herself to prevent the media 
20110124203255.000|20110124203257.000|TR0|from exploiting the news.

20110124203300.000|20110124203302.000|TR0|A couple other top stories I want to pass 
20110124203302.000|20110124203304.000|TR0|along here.
20110124203304.000|20110124203307.000|TR0|
20110124203307.000|20110124203309.000|TR0|First, a man suspected of gunning down two 
20110124203309.000|20110124203311.000|TR0|police officers this morning has been 
20110124203311.000|20110124203314.000|TR0|found dead in his Saint Petersburg, 
20110124203314.000|20110124203316.000|TR0|Florida, home. This has going -- been 
20110124203316.000|20110124203319.000|TR0|going on, I should say, all day long.  The 
20110124203319.000|20110124203321.000|TR0|alleged shooter was holed up in his house 
20110124203321.000|20110124203323.000|TR0|for about six hours after this whole 
20110124203323.000|20110124203326.000|TR0|shoot-out with police.
20110124203326.000|20110124203328.000|TR0|
20110124203328.000|20110124203330.000|TR0|Investigators believe the guy started 
20110124203330.000|20110124203333.000|TR0|shooting at the officers when they showed 
20110124203333.000|20110124203335.000|TR0|up this morning to serve him with an 
20110124203335.000|20110124203338.000|TR0|aggravated battery warrant.  And, about an 
20110124203338.000|20110124203340.000|TR0|hour ago, police were tearing into this 
20110124203340.000|20110124203342.000|TR0|home with a backhoe, just trying to get to 
20110124203342.000|20110124203345.000|TR0|him.
20110124203345.000|20110124203347.000|TR0|
20110124203347.000|20110124203349.000|TR0|According to local news report, people who 
20110124203349.000|20110124203352.000|TR0|live in the neighborhood are now being 
20110124203352.000|20110124203354.000|TR0|allowed back in their homes.  A third 
20110124203354.000|20110124203357.000|TR0|officer, a U.S. deputy marshal, was 
20110124203357.000|20110124203359.000|TR0|injured in the shoot-out.  The chief says 
20110124203359.000|20110124203401.000|TR0|the two police officers kill -- quote -- 
20110124203401.000|20110124203404.000|TR0|"died as heroes." The story is still 
20110124203404.000|20110124203406.000|TR0|unfolding.  We will keep watching it for 
20110124203406.000|20110124203408.000|TR0|you.
20110124203408.000|20110124203411.000|TR0|
20110124203411.000|20110124203413.000|TR0|The U.S. Postal Service trying to save a 
20110124203413.000|20110124203415.000|TR0|lot of money.  Starting in March, they're 
20110124203415.000|20110124203418.000|TR0|going to start working on this plan to 
20110124203418.000|20110124203420.000|TR0|close as many as 2,000 locations this 
20110124203420.000|20110124203423.000|TR0|year.  Another 491 closures are already 
20110124203423.000|20110124203425.000|TR0|under way.  The Postal Service says -- 
20110124203425.000|20110124203427.000|TR0|this is what is important here -- no post 
20110124203427.000|20110124203430.000|TR0|offices will be closed.  I'm talking 
20110124203430.000|20110124203432.000|TR0|specific -- specifically about stations 
20110124203432.000|20110124203434.000|TR0|and branches here to be targeted.  They're 
20110124203434.000|20110124203437.000|TR0|-- they're smaller than post offices and 
20110124203437.000|20110124203439.000|TR0|don't handle mail processing.
20110124203439.000|20110124203442.000|TR0|
20110124203442.000|20110124203444.000|TR0|And, you know, we all get the letters in 
20110124203444.000|20110124203446.000|TR0|the mail.  We have to perform our civic 
20110124203446.000|20110124203449.000|TR0|duties, right?  And you don't get a pass 
20110124203449.000|20110124203451.000|TR0|for jury duty, even if you are the vice 
20110124203451.000|20110124203453.000|TR0|president.

20110124203501.000|20110124203503.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  That's why Joe Biden reported to 
20110124203503.000|20110124203505.000|TR0|a courthouse this morning in Wilmington, 
20110124203505.000|20110124203508.000|TR0|Delaware.  But, shocker, he was dismissed 
20110124203508.000|20110124203510.000|TR0|after a couple of hours.
20110124203510.000|20110124203512.000|TR0|
20110124203512.000|20110124203515.000|TR0|Now, the vice president, mind you, not the 
20110124203515.000|20110124203517.000|TR0|only one who this happened to recently of 
20110124203517.000|20110124203520.000|TR0|his sort of stature.  Supreme Court 
20110124203520.000|20110124203522.000|TR0|Justice Elena Kagan showed up to serve at 
20110124203522.000|20110124203524.000|TR0|a D.C. Superior Court last week, and she 
20110124203524.000|20110124203527.000|TR0|too was sent home.

20110124203531.000|20110124203534.000|TR0|died.  Jack LaLanne was all about 
20110124203534.000|20110124203536.000|TR0|exercising and eating right, and here he 
20110124203536.000|20110124203538.000|TR0|is on the workout show he hosted for more 
20110124203538.000|20110124203541.000|TR0|than 30 years starting way back in 1951.  
20110124203541.000|20110124203543.000|TR0|Even in his 90s LaLanne started the day 
20110124203543.000|20110124203546.000|TR0|with a not one but two- hour workout.  
20110124203546.000|20110124203548.000|TR0|Jack LaLanne died of respiratory failure 
20110124203548.000|20110124203550.000|TR0|due to pneumonia.  He was 96-years-old.

20110124203706.000|20110124203709.000|TR0|equipment to freeze and it doesn't want to

20110124203732.000|20110124203735.000|TR0|KENNEDY:  They use 2,500 tons of 
20110124203735.000|20110124203737.000|TR0|explosives every day, an explosive power 
20110124203737.000|20110124203739.000|TR0|the size of Hiroshima bomb once a week.

20110124203747.000|20110124203749.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Explosive.  What is he talking 
20110124203749.000|20110124203751.000|TR0|about?  Coming back, I'll talk to him live 
20110124203751.000|20110124203754.000|TR0|about this documentary now playing at the 
20110124203754.000|20110124203756.000|TR0|Sundance Film Festival.  Also I'll be 
20110124203756.000|20110124203758.000|TR0|talking to the director.

20110124203801.000|20110124203803.000|TR0|Then, have you seen this unbelievable 
20110124203803.000|20110124203806.000|TR0|video?  Amazingly no one got hurt.  Look 
20110124203806.000|20110124203808.000|TR0|at that.  We'll explain what happened when 
20110124203808.000|20110124203810.000|TR0|we come back.

20110124203817.000|20110124203820.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  You think you've had a tough 
20110124203820.000|20110124203822.000|TR0|commute?  Wait until you see this.  Let's 
20110124203822.000|20110124203825.000|TR0|look at this together here.  This driver 
20110124203825.000|20110124203827.000|TR0|making his way down the highway.  This is 
20110124203827.000|20110124203829.000|TR0|Canada.  Watch screen left.  Watch, watch, 
20110124203829.000|20110124203832.000|TR0|bam, a tractor trailer flips over, smashes 
20110124203832.000|20110124203834.000|TR0|into the guardrail. Amazingly, police say 
20110124203834.000|20110124203836.000|TR0|the driver was not injured.  Look at that.
20110124203836.000|20110124203839.000|TR0|
20110124203839.000|20110124203841.000|TR0|Now, as President Obama gets ready to 
20110124203841.000|20110124203843.000|TR0|deliver tomorrow night's state of the 
20110124203843.000|20110124203846.000|TR0|union address, his opponents are getting 
20110124203846.000|20110124203848.000|TR0|ready to react to whatever it is he may be 
20110124203848.000|20110124203851.000|TR0|saying.  CNN has decided to take an 
20110124203851.000|20110124203853.000|TR0|unbiased look at our state of the union by 
20110124203853.000|20110124203855.000|TR0|talking to leading experts in various 
20110124203855.000|20110124203858.000|TR0|fields.
20110124203858.000|20110124203900.000|TR0|
20110124203900.000|20110124203902.000|TR0|Right now I want to focus on the state of 
20110124203902.000|20110124203905.000|TR0|the infrastructure with Tom Foreman who is 
20110124203905.000|20110124203907.000|TR0|in Washington to break all of this down 
20110124203907.000|20110124203910.000|TR0|for me. Tom Foreman with the magic wall, 
20110124203910.000|20110124203912.000|TR0|magic map, when we say infrastructure, 
20110124203912.000|20110124203914.000|TR0|what are we talking about specifically?
20110124203914.000|20110124203917.000|TR0|
20110124203917.000|20110124203919.000|TR0|TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We're 
20110124203919.000|20110124203921.000|TR0|talking about our roads, bridge, dams, 
20110124203921.000|20110124203924.000|TR0|levees, all of these things we rely on all 
20110124203924.000|20110124203926.000|TR0|the time. And the American society of 
20110124203926.000|20110124203929.000|TR0|civil engineers issues regular report 
20110124203929.000|20110124203931.000|TR0|cards where they consult with experts all 
20110124203931.000|20110124203933.000|TR0|over the country who study all of this.  
20110124203933.000|20110124203936.000|TR0|What they're saying over and over again is 
20110124203936.000|20110124203938.000|TR0|that it is pretty weak when we look at all 
20110124203938.000|20110124203940.000|TR0|the systems we rely on.
20110124203940.000|20110124203943.000|TR0|
20110124203943.000|20110124203945.000|TR0|Let's start with bridges.  We've had some 
20110124203945.000|20110124203948.000|TR0|terrible incidents in recent years where 
20110124203948.000|20110124203950.000|TR0|we've had bridges closed in big way.  
20110124203950.000|20110124203952.000|TR0|We've had big collapses like the one in 
20110124203952.000|20110124203955.000|TR0|Minneapolis you may recall.  There's no 
20110124203955.000|20110124203957.000|TR0|surprise it's happening because the 
20110124203957.000|20110124203959.000|TR0|society says that one in four bridges in 
20110124203959.000|20110124204002.000|TR0|this country right now is either 
20110124204002.000|20110124204004.000|TR0|structurally deficient, meaning it needs 
20110124204004.000|20110124204006.000|TR0|some kind of repair in the process, or 
20110124204006.000|20110124204009.000|TR0|that it is simply obsolete.  It's not made 
20110124204009.000|20110124204011.000|TR0|to handle the type of loads that we have 
20110124204011.000|20110124204014.000|TR0|today and the type of traffic we have 
20110124204014.000|20110124204016.000|TR0|today.
20110124204016.000|20110124204018.000|TR0|
20110124204018.000|20110124204021.000|TR0|That's one of the big problems out there, 
20110124204021.000|20110124204023.000|TR0|Brooke, right now, when you look at simply 
20110124204023.000|20110124204025.000|TR0|the question of handling bridges.
20110124204025.000|20110124204028.000|TR0|
20110124204028.000|20110124204030.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  So that's bridges.  What about 
20110124204030.000|20110124204033.000|TR0|something as simple as water systems, tom?
20110124204033.000|20110124204035.000|TR0|
20110124204035.000|20110124204037.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  Water systems, this is a really 
20110124204037.000|20110124204040.000|TR0|interesting one.  This is the kind of 
20110124204040.000|20110124204042.000|TR0|thing, they'll tell you in a heartbeat, 
20110124204042.000|20110124204044.000|TR0|people don't think about a lot.  You go to 
20110124204044.000|20110124204047.000|TR0|the faucet, get water.  Everything seems 
20110124204047.000|20110124204049.000|TR0|fine.  But you've seen the stories lately 
20110124204049.000|20110124204052.000|TR0|about the massive leaks in water lines 
20110124204052.000|20110124204054.000|TR0|where you see water spewing into the 
20110124204054.000|20110124204056.000|TR0|streets, turning roads into rivers.
20110124204056.000|20110124204059.000|TR0|
20110124204059.000|20110124204101.000|TR0|This is no accident that this is 
20110124204101.000|20110124204103.000|TR0|happening.  This is happening because this 
20110124204103.000|20110124204106.000|TR0|has been going on for many, many, many 
20110124204106.000|20110124204108.000|TR0|years.  Many water systems are very old.  
20110124204108.000|20110124204111.000|TR0|They don't have the money to repair them.  
20110124204111.000|20110124204113.000|TR0|They don't have the money to keep up with 
20110124204113.000|20110124204115.000|TR0|the growing demand.
20110124204115.000|20110124204118.000|TR0|
20110124204118.000|20110124204120.000|TR0|You know what their estimate is?  This is 
20110124204120.000|20110124204122.000|TR0|absolutely astonishing.
20110124204122.000|20110124204125.000|TR0|
20110124204125.000|20110124204127.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  What?
20110124204127.000|20110124204129.000|TR0|
20110124204129.000|20110124204132.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  It's seven billion gallons of 
20110124204132.000|20110124204134.000|TR0|clean drinking water are leaking every day 
20110124204134.000|20110124204137.000|TR0|through pipe that's are simply leaky.
20110124204137.000|20110124204139.000|TR0|
20110124204139.000|20110124204141.000|TR0|Electricity, here is another one, same 
20110124204141.000|20110124204144.000|TR0|story, we all count on electricity in 
20110124204144.000|20110124204146.000|TR0|everything we do all the time.  Look at 
20110124204146.000|20110124204148.000|TR0|this.  We have all of this electrical it 
20110124204148.000|20110124204151.000|TR0|demand in this country.  The demand is so 
20110124204151.000|20110124204153.000|TR0|far outpacing the supply that we've had 
20110124204153.000|20110124204156.000|TR0|our electricity demand grow by 25 percent 
20110124204156.000|20110124204158.000|TR0|since 1990, but we're just not really 
20110124204158.000|20110124204200.000|TR0|keeping up with that.
20110124204200.000|20110124204203.000|TR0|
20110124204203.000|20110124204205.000|TR0|And all of this just keeps growing and 
20110124204205.000|20110124204207.000|TR0|growing and growing.  The real problem is 
20110124204207.000|20110124204210.000|TR0|they say it's a patch and pray methods, 
20110124204210.000|20110124204212.000|TR0|what's going on in too many places.  We're 
20110124204212.000|20110124204215.000|TR0|not really investing in new growth, not 
20110124204215.000|20110124204217.000|TR0|really investing in maintaining the old 
20110124204217.000|20110124204219.000|TR0|one.  We just slap on a patch and say, we 
20110124204219.000|20110124204222.000|TR0|pray this will work and keep things going. 
20110124204222.000|20110124204224.000|TR0| You see the power supplies failures, 
20110124204224.000|20110124204226.000|TR0|water failures, bridge failures.
20110124204226.000|20110124204229.000|TR0|
20110124204229.000|20110124204231.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  You said seven billion gallons 
20110124204231.000|20110124204234.000|TR0|of perfectly fine drinking water?  That's 
20110124204234.000|20110124204236.000|TR0|terrible.  You give me the gloom and doom. 
20110124204236.000|20110124204238.000|TR0|Give me a bright spot, something that 
20110124204238.000|20110124204241.000|TR0|looks optimistic.
20110124204241.000|20110124204243.000|TR0|

20110124204248.000|20110124204250.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  Here is a bright spot.  This is 
20110124204250.000|20110124204252.000|TR0|a bright spot.  It may not seem much of a 
20110124204252.000|20110124204255.000|TR0|bright spot, but it really is.  Solid 
20110124204255.000|20110124204257.000|TR0|waste disposal, this is really -- you 
20110124204257.000|20110124204300.000|TR0|wouldn't think this is something we're 
20110124204300.000|20110124204302.000|TR0|doing well on.
20110124204302.000|20110124204304.000|TR0|
20110124204304.000|20110124204307.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  We're doing good with waste?
20110124204307.000|20110124204309.000|TR0|
20110124204309.000|20110124204311.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  Yes, mainly because we haven't 
20110124204311.000|20110124204314.000|TR0|substantially increased the amount of 
20110124204314.000|20110124204316.000|TR0|waste that each one of us generates year 
20110124204316.000|20110124204319.000|TR0|to year.  We're still kind of about the 
20110124204319.000|20110124204321.000|TR0|same we were some time back, but we're 
20110124204321.000|20110124204323.000|TR0|doing a much better job moving toward 
20110124204323.000|20110124204326.000|TR0|recycling of a lot of this waste.  So by 
20110124204326.000|20110124204328.000|TR0|and large we're at least holding our own, 
20110124204328.000|20110124204330.000|TR0|maybe making some progress there.
20110124204330.000|20110124204333.000|TR0|
20110124204333.000|20110124204335.000|TR0|We do have to keep an eye on electronic 
20110124204335.000|20110124204338.000|TR0|waste, Brooke.  All the old cell phones 
20110124204338.000|20110124204340.000|TR0|and computers and printers we're throwing 
20110124204340.000|20110124204342.000|TR0|away, those things are really a problem.  
20110124204342.000|20110124204345.000|TR0|If you ever go out to a dump, it's just 
20110124204345.000|20110124204347.000|TR0|the most astonishing thing to see the 
20110124204347.000|20110124204349.000|TR0|mountains of old computers and old phones. 
20110124204349.000|20110124204352.000|TR0| And it's this electronic throwaway 
20110124204352.000|20110124204354.000|TR0|culture we have.  But overall this is one 
20110124204354.000|20110124204357.000|TR0|of our improvements.
20110124204357.000|20110124204359.000|TR0|
20110124204359.000|20110124204401.000|TR0|The bottom line, Brooke, is you can't fix 
20110124204401.000|20110124204404.000|TR0|these kinds of problems quickly.  They 
20110124204404.000|20110124204406.000|TR0|build up over a very long period of time.  
20110124204406.000|20110124204408.000|TR0|There's nothing glamorous about fixing it, 
20110124204408.000|20110124204411.000|TR0|so politicians aren't thrilled to say, let 
20110124204411.000|20110124204413.000|TR0|me go put a plaque on the repaired water 
20110124204413.000|20110124204415.000|TR0|pipe because it doesn't seem very 
20110124204415.000|20110124204418.000|TR0|exciting.  But this is the nuts and bolts 
20110124204418.000|20110124204420.000|TR0|of making our country and our economy run.
20110124204420.000|20110124204423.000|TR0|
20110124204423.000|20110124204425.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Absolutely.
20110124204425.000|20110124204427.000|TR0|
20110124204427.000|20110124204430.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  If we don't get serious about 
20110124204430.000|20110124204432.000|TR0|it, the long-term cost of this unglamorous 
20110124204432.000|20110124204434.000|TR0|work is much, much, much more devastating 
20110124204434.000|20110124204437.000|TR0|than some of the flashy things out there.
20110124204437.000|20110124204439.000|TR0|
20110124204439.000|20110124204442.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  It's unglamorous but crucial.

20110124204444.000|20110124204446.000|TR0|infrastructure, we'll watch and see where 
20110124204446.000|20110124204449.000|TR0|the president goes with that in the State 
20110124204449.000|20110124204451.000|TR0|of the Union.  Thank you, sir.
20110124204451.000|20110124204453.000|TR0|
20110124204453.000|20110124204456.000|TR0|FOREMAN:  Thank you.

20110124204458.000|20110124204501.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  And don't forget to watch CNN 
20110124204501.000|20110124204503.000|TR0|and CNN.com tomorrow night for president 
20110124204503.000|20110124204505.000|TR0|Obama's State of the Union address.  Our 
20110124204505.000|20110124204508.000|TR0|prime- time coverage will begin with the 
20110124204508.000|20110124204510.000|TR0|best political television.  Don't miss 
20110124204510.000|20110124204512.000|TR0|that at 7:00, then the state of the union 
20110124204512.000|20110124204515.000|TR0|at 9:00, followed by the Republican 
20110124204515.000|20110124204517.000|TR0|response and a full wrap up with reaction 
20110124204517.000|20110124204520.000|TR0|and analysis anchored by Anderson Cooper.  
20110124204520.000|20110124204522.000|TR0|     Now, we've been watching the 
20110124204522.000|20110124204524.000|TR0|developments inside the federal Phoenix 
20110124204524.000|20110124204527.000|TR0|courtroom where Tucson shooting suspect 
20110124204527.000|20110124204529.000|TR0|Jared Lee Loughner has entered a plea.  I 
20110124204529.000|20110124204531.000|TR0|want to go to Ted Rowlands just outside 
20110124204531.000|20110124204534.000|TR0|from the courtroom.  Ted, what did he 
20110124204534.000|20110124204536.000|TR0|enter?
20110124204536.000|20110124204538.000|TR0|
20110124204538.000|20110124204541.000|TR0|TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, he 
20110124204541.000|20110124204543.000|TR0|entered a not guilty plea on the three 
20110124204543.000|20110124204546.000|TR0|counts.  When he was asked to enter a 
20110124204546.000|20110124204548.000|TR0|plea, his attorney Judy Clark said they 
20110124204548.000|20110124204550.000|TR0|would like the court to enter the plea for 
20110124204550.000|20110124204553.000|TR0|him.  So the judge did so.
20110124204553.000|20110124204555.000|TR0|
20110124204555.000|20110124204557.000|TR0|Little different look to Jared lee 
20110124204557.000|20110124204600.000|TR0|Loughner today in court compared to his 
20110124204600.000|20110124204602.000|TR0|last appearance.  His hair had grown out 
20110124204602.000|20110124204605.000|TR0|and that smile, that disgusting smirk that 
20110124204605.000|20110124204607.000|TR0|you saw on that photo that was taken of 
20110124204607.000|20110124204609.000|TR0|him, well, that was back on his face as he 
20110124204609.000|20110124204612.000|TR0|came into the courtroom and then as he sat 
20110124204612.000|20110124204614.000|TR0|at the defense table.
20110124204614.000|20110124204616.000|TR0|
20110124204616.000|20110124204619.000|TR0|They brought him out a little early so he 
20110124204619.000|20110124204621.000|TR0|had sort of this awkward ten minutes 
20110124204621.000|20110124204624.000|TR0|before the judge took the bench where he 
20110124204624.000|20110124204626.000|TR0|was just sitting in this courtroom with 
20110124204626.000|20110124204628.000|TR0|his lawyers and there was dead silence. 
20110124204628.000|20110124204631.000|TR0|But he was looking around, smiling.  At 
20110124204631.000|20110124204633.000|TR0|one point I saw him even chuckling a 
20110124204633.000|20110124204635.000|TR0|little bit.  He seemed to, unlike the 
20110124204635.000|20110124204638.000|TR0|first appearance, where he seemed nervous 
20110124204638.000|20110124204640.000|TR0|and focused, he seemed to in his own way I 
20110124204640.000|20110124204643.000|TR0|guess maybe enjoying the attention that he 
20110124204643.000|20110124204645.000|TR0|was getting.  That was the big difference.
20110124204645.000|20110124204647.000|TR0|
20110124204647.000|20110124204650.000|TR0|The other things -- go ahead.
20110124204650.000|20110124204652.000|TR0|
20110124204652.000|20110124204654.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  No.  I'm just sort of reacting 
20110124204654.000|20110124204657.000|TR0|to the disgusting smirk back on his face.  
20110124204657.000|20110124204659.000|TR0|Go ahead.  Do we have a trial date set?
20110124204659.000|20110124204701.000|TR0|
20110124204701.000|20110124204704.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Yes.  Well, here's basically 
20110124204704.000|20110124204706.000|TR0|what transpired.  He entered these pleas 
20110124204706.000|20110124204709.000|TR0|of not guilty, the court did on his 
20110124204709.000|20110124204711.000|TR0|behalf.  One interesting thing the judge 
20110124204711.000|20110124204713.000|TR0|asked both attorneys, are you worried 
20110124204713.000|20110124204716.000|TR0|about the defendant's competence?  Does he 
20110124204716.000|20110124204718.000|TR0|understand the proceedings? What's going 
20110124204718.000|20110124204720.000|TR0|on?
20110124204720.000|20110124204723.000|TR0|
20110124204723.000|20110124204725.000|TR0|And Loughner's lawyer, Judy Clark, said, 
20110124204725.000|20110124204728.000|TR0|we don't have that concern at this time, 
20110124204728.000|20110124204730.000|TR0|your honor.  Then the prosecution was 
20110124204730.000|20110124204732.000|TR0|asked the same question, and they said the 
20110124204732.000|20110124204735.000|TR0|same thing.  Well, at this time we don't 
20110124204735.000|20110124204737.000|TR0|have that concern, but we may in the 
20110124204737.000|20110124204739.000|TR0|future, which was a little bit surprising 
20110124204739.000|20110124204742.000|TR0|coming from the prosecution's side, sort 
20110124204742.000|20110124204744.000|TR0|of putting that in play the mental 
20110124204744.000|20110124204747.000|TR0|competence of this defendant may be a 
20110124204747.000|20110124204749.000|TR0|major factor moving forward.
20110124204749.000|20110124204751.000|TR0|
20110124204751.000|20110124204754.000|TR0|We still don't have the indictments on the 
20110124204754.000|20110124204756.000|TR0|two murder charges. The judge asked when 
20110124204756.000|20110124204758.000|TR0|he could expect those additional charges.  
20110124204758.000|20110124204801.000|TR0|The prosecution said within 30 to 45 days. 
20110124204801.000|20110124204803.000|TR0| What they've done is rather than set any 
20110124204803.000|20110124204806.000|TR0|sort of a trial date, they're setting a 
20110124204806.000|20110124204808.000|TR0|status conference for March 9th, giving 
20110124204808.000|20110124204810.000|TR0|the prosecution more opportunities for 
20110124204810.000|20110124204813.000|TR0|more charges.  But the headline here is 
20110124204813.000|20110124204815.000|TR0|Jared Loughner's smile was back on his 
20110124204815.000|20110124204817.000|TR0|face in his second court appearance.
20110124204817.000|20110124204820.000|TR0|
20110124204820.000|20110124204822.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Ted Rowlands for me Pn phoenix.  
20110124204822.000|20110124204825.000|TR0|Thanks for the update.

20110124204919.000|20110124204921.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Joining me now live from the 
20110124204921.000|20110124204924.000|TR0|Sundance Film Festival, Robert Kennedy Jr. 
20110124204924.000|20110124204926.000|TR0|and documentary director Bill Haney.  
20110124204926.000|20110124204929.000|TR0|Gentlemen, good to have you on.  Listen, 
20110124204929.000|20110124204931.000|TR0|you and I both know mountaintop removal 
20110124204931.000|20110124204933.000|TR0|it's nothing new, so what was it about the 
20110124204933.000|20110124204936.000|TR0|Coal River Mountain in this community's 
20110124204936.000|20110124204938.000|TR0|fight that caught your eye?  Robert, to 
20110124204938.000|20110124204940.000|TR0|you first.
20110124204940.000|20110124204943.000|TR0|
20110124204943.000|20110124204945.000|TR0|KENNEDY:  Well, there's nothing new about 
20110124204945.000|20110124204948.000|TR0|mountaintop removing mining.  It 
20110124204948.000|20110124204950.000|TR0|accelerated during the beginning of the 
20110124204950.000|20110124204952.000|TR0|Bush administration dramatically.  It was 
20110124204952.000|20110124204955.000|TR0|made legal for the first time, and since 
20110124204955.000|20110124204957.000|TR0|then we've cut down 1.4 million acres, the 
20110124204957.000|20110124204959.000|TR0|area the size of Delaware flattened, 500 
20110124204959.000|20110124205002.000|TR0|of the biggest mountains in West Virginia, 
20110124205002.000|20110124205004.000|TR0|and we've buried almost 2,000 miles of 
20110124205004.000|20110124205006.000|TR0|rivers and streams.
20110124205006.000|20110124205009.000|TR0|
20110124205009.000|20110124205011.000|TR0|Mainly one company, Massie Coal, and this 
20110124205011.000|20110124205014.000|TR0|story is about one of the last big 
20110124205014.000|20110124205016.000|TR0|mountains left in the coal fields of West 
20110124205016.000|20110124205018.000|TR0|Virginia that hasn't been flattened, and 
20110124205018.000|20110124205021.000|TR0|there's a group of people who live there 
20110124205021.000|20110124205023.000|TR0|who finally said we're not going to take 
20110124205023.000|20110124205025.000|TR0|it anymore, and they have mounted a battle 
20110124205025.000|20110124205028.000|TR0|against the coal industry to save their 
20110124205028.000|20110124205030.000|TR0|communities, to save their jobs and to 
20110124205030.000|20110124205033.000|TR0|save their mountains, their rivers and 
20110124205033.000|20110124205035.000|TR0|streams and the health of their children.
20110124205035.000|20110124205037.000|TR0|
20110124205037.000|20110124205040.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  Now before we continue, I do 
20110124205040.000|20110124205042.000|TR0|want to say we reached out, CNN reached 
20110124205042.000|20110124205044.000|TR0|out to Massie Energy and also Senator 
20110124205044.000|20110124205047.000|TR0|Manchin, once governor of West Virginia, 
20110124205047.000|20110124205049.000|TR0|to comment on your film and.  And you 
20110124205049.000|20110124205052.000|TR0|know, Massie's PR folks told us they 
20110124205052.000|20110124205054.000|TR0|didn't know what we were talking about. 
20110124205054.000|20110124205056.000|TR0|They weren't familiar with it.
20110124205056.000|20110124205059.000|TR0|
20110124205059.000|20110124205101.000|TR0|So I know, Bill, you've talked about how 
20110124205101.000|20110124205103.000|TR0|this is sort of a David and Goliath story, 
20110124205103.000|20110124205106.000|TR0|but, you know, if you're taking on 
20110124205106.000|20110124205108.000|TR0|goliath, if Goliath doesn't know they are 
20110124205108.000|20110124205111.000|TR0|doing battle with you, what's your 
20110124205111.000|20110124205113.000|TR0|response to them?  Bill and then Robert.
20110124205113.000|20110124205115.000|TR0|
20110124205115.000|20110124205118.000|TR0|BILL HANEY, DIRECTOR, "THE LAST MOUNTAIN": 
20110124205118.000|20110124205120.000|TR0| Well, I mean, so two things.  First, the 
20110124205120.000|20110124205122.000|TR0|David and Goliath story isn't about us.  
20110124205122.000|20110124205125.000|TR0|It's about the local activists risking 
20110124205125.000|20110124205127.000|TR0|everything to stand up for the health and 
20110124205127.000|20110124205129.000|TR0|welfare of their community and the battle 
20110124205129.000|20110124205132.000|TR0|taking place at the last mountain is a 
20110124205132.000|20110124205134.000|TR0|fight for the last great mountain in 
20110124205134.000|20110124205137.000|TR0|Appalachia between the mining company 
20110124205137.000|20110124205139.000|TR0|Massie that wants to blow it up and rip 
20110124205139.000|20110124205141.000|TR0|the coal and the locals that want to stop 
20110124205141.000|20110124205144.000|TR0|them and build a wind farm instead.  And 
20110124205144.000|20110124205146.000|TR0|it's a fight of citizen democracy against 
20110124205146.000|20110124205148.000|TR0|corporate power.     And we in fact did 
20110124205148.000|20110124205151.000|TR0|repeatedly off the CEO of Massie Coal to 
20110124205151.000|20110124205153.000|TR0|participate in the film and chose not to 
20110124205153.000|20110124205156.000|TR0|take advantage of it but suggested that we 
20110124205156.000|20110124205158.000|TR0|talk to the head of the West Virginia coal 
20110124205158.000|20110124205200.000|TR0|association which we did repeatedly.
20110124205200.000|20110124205203.000|TR0|
20110124205203.000|20110124205205.000|TR0|KENNEDY:  Brooke --
20110124205205.000|20110124205207.000|TR0|
20110124205207.000|20110124205210.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  We know Mr. Blankenship is no 
20110124205210.000|20110124205212.000|TR0|longer CEO with the company but as you 
20110124205212.000|20110124205215.000|TR0|were shooting your documentary he was.  Go 
20110124205215.000|20110124205217.000|TR0|ahead, Robert, jump in.
20110124205217.000|20110124205219.000|TR0|
20110124205219.000|20110124205222.000|TR0|KENNEDY:  Well, one of the big issues is 
20110124205222.000|20110124205224.000|TR0|that we talk about is the subversion of 
20110124205224.000|20110124205226.000|TR0|democracy in this state that goes hand in 
20110124205226.000|20110124205229.000|TR0|hand with the destruction of the 
20110124205229.000|20110124205231.000|TR0|environment, that the democracy is 
20110124205231.000|20110124205234.000|TR0|destroyed at the local level, the citizen 
20110124205234.000|20110124205236.000|TR0|participation is eroded, that the agencies 
20110124205236.000|20110124205238.000|TR0|supposed to protect the public from big 
20110124205238.000|20110124205241.000|TR0|pollution and industry have been captured 
20110124205241.000|20110124205243.000|TR0|by the industries and have been sock 
20110124205243.000|20110124205245.000|TR0|puppets for these industries.
20110124205245.000|20110124205248.000|TR0|
20110124205248.000|20110124205250.000|TR0|And these people are trying to battle the 
20110124205250.000|20110124205252.000|TR0|state agencies, and the government of West 
20110124205252.000|20110124205255.000|TR0|Virginia -- virtually all of the relevant 
20110124205255.000|20110124205257.000|TR0|officials have been corrupted, including 
20110124205257.000|20110124205300.000|TR0|the judges have been corrupted by the 
20110124205300.000|20110124205302.000|TR0|industry.
20110124205302.000|20110124205304.000|TR0|
20110124205304.000|20110124205307.000|TR0|But one of the most effective tools of the 
20110124205307.000|20110124205309.000|TR0|industry has been able to Marshall has 
20110124205309.000|20110124205311.000|TR0|they have been able to disable the press 
20110124205311.000|20110124205314.000|TR0|in West Virginia and across the country so 
20110124205314.000|20110124205316.000|TR0|they don't cover this issue and that's one 
20110124205316.000|20110124205319.000|TR0|of the reasons why people haven't heard of 
20110124205319.000|20110124205321.000|TR0|this is because -- we're grateful for you 
20110124205321.000|20110124205323.000|TR0|because you're one of the few reporters 
20110124205323.000|20110124205326.000|TR0|that is actually consistently covered this 
20110124205326.000|20110124205328.000|TR0|issue, but most of them are out there 
20110124205328.000|20110124205330.000|TR0|covering Britney Spears slow promotional 
20110124205330.000|20110124205333.000|TR0|decline.
20110124205333.000|20110124205335.000|TR0|
20110124205335.000|20110124205338.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  We want to showcase your 
20110124205338.000|20110124205340.000|TR0|documentary.  And to Bill's point.  I know 
20110124205340.000|20110124205342.000|TR0|a lot of this story is really propelled by 
20110124205342.000|20110124205345.000|TR0|the members of the community.  I've lived 
20110124205345.000|20110124205347.000|TR0|and work in West Virginia and know about 
20110124205347.000|20110124205349.000|TR0|the effects of mountaintop removal, 
20110124205349.000|20110124205352.000|TR0|specifically in flash flooding. There's a 
20110124205352.000|20110124205354.000|TR0|woman Maria.  I want to play this clip.  
20110124205354.000|20110124205357.000|TR0|It shows a woman named Maria whose home 
20110124205357.000|20110124205359.000|TR0|was almost washed away.  Let's watch this 
20110124205359.000|20110124205401.000|TR0|and we'll talk on the other side.
20110124205401.000|20110124205404.000|TR0|
20110124205404.000|20110124205406.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110124205406.000|20110124205408.000|TR0|
20110124205408.000|20110124205411.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  About 4:30 in the 
20110124205411.000|20110124205413.000|TR0|evening it started raining, and it was 
20110124205413.000|20110124205415.000|TR0|pretty heavy rain.  I think we ended up 
20110124205415.000|20110124205418.000|TR0|with like 4.5 inches of rain in four 
20110124205418.000|20110124205420.000|TR0|hours.  There was nothing there to absorb 
20110124205420.000|20110124205423.000|TR0|the rainfall, and when it came washing off 
20110124205423.000|20110124205425.000|TR0|the rock back here, it come washing of in 
20110124205425.000|20110124205427.000|TR0|a torrent.  And it turned this little tiny 
20110124205427.000|20110124205430.000|TR0|stream into a raging river that ran, well, 
20110124205430.000|20110124205432.000|TR0|it cut a chasm through our property 67 
20110124205432.000|20110124205434.000|TR0|feet wide.
20110124205434.000|20110124205437.000|TR0|

20110124205439.000|20110124205442.000|TR0|
20110124205442.000|20110124205444.000|TR0|KENNEDY:  And she goes on to talk about 
20110124205444.000|20110124205446.000|TR0|how, you know, she said the rain was not 
20110124205446.000|20110124205449.000|TR0|an act of god, unlike perhaps what some 
20110124205449.000|20110124205451.000|TR0|coal companies were alleging.  Bill, to 
20110124205451.000|20110124205453.000|TR0|you, since you brought up the whole point 
20110124205453.000|20110124205456.000|TR0|-- what do you want viewers of the 
20110124205456.000|20110124205458.000|TR0|documentary to take away from Maria's 
20110124205458.000|20110124205501.000|TR0|stories and other stories in the D.C.?
20110124205501.000|20110124205503.000|TR0|
20110124205503.000|20110124205505.000|TR0|HANEY:  I think the most important thing 
20110124205505.000|20110124205508.000|TR0|to take away is the power of the Americans 
20110124205508.000|20110124205510.000|TR0|who have a passion.  This wonderful 
20110124205510.000|20110124205512.000|TR0|waitress decided to fight -- first, she 
20110124205512.000|20110124205515.000|TR0|started standing up for her rights and 
20110124205515.000|20110124205517.000|TR0|when the local politicians didn't respond, 
20110124205517.000|20110124205520.000|TR0|she went to the state. When they didn't 
20110124205520.000|20110124205522.000|TR0|respond, she went to the courts and she 
20110124205522.000|20110124205524.000|TR0|began a national campaign.
20110124205524.000|20110124205527.000|TR0|
20110124205527.000|20110124205529.000|TR0|And after a series of years, she's now won 
20110124205529.000|20110124205531.000|TR0|the Goldman Prize which is the highest 
20110124205531.000|20110124205534.000|TR0|environmental prize in the country, the 
20110124205534.000|20110124205536.000|TR0|biggest mine, already permitted in this 
20110124205536.000|20110124205538.000|TR0|country was stopped this week by the EPA.  
20110124205538.000|20110124205541.000|TR0|Massie has had mines shut down as a 
20110124205541.000|20110124205543.000|TR0|consequence of activism like hers.
20110124205543.000|20110124205546.000|TR0|
20110124205546.000|20110124205548.000|TR0|So she's a wonderful example of an 
20110124205548.000|20110124205550.000|TR0|ordinary American's ability to find 
20110124205550.000|20110124205553.000|TR0|something extraordinary in themselves when 
20110124205553.000|20110124205555.000|TR0|they want to take democracy back, and I 
20110124205555.000|20110124205557.000|TR0|hope people who see this will find this 
20110124205557.000|20110124205600.000|TR0|uplifting.
20110124205600.000|20110124205602.000|TR0|
20110124205602.000|20110124205605.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  I understand, but at the same 
20110124205605.000|20110124205607.000|TR0|time you have to play the other side of 
20110124205607.000|20110124205609.000|TR0|the card.  If you're in West Virginia all 
20110124205609.000|20110124205612.000|TR0|the billboards up saying "Coal fuels 
20110124205612.000|20110124205614.000|TR0|jobs."  Robert, what's your message to the 
20110124205614.000|20110124205616.000|TR0|thousands of coal miners who really rely 
20110124205616.000|20110124205619.000|TR0|on coal to feed their families?
20110124205619.000|20110124205621.000|TR0|
20110124205621.000|20110124205624.000|TR0|KENNEDY:  Well, coal has not brought 
20110124205624.000|20110124205626.000|TR0|prosperity to West Virginia. Coal has 
20110124205626.000|20110124205628.000|TR0|brought poverty to West Virginia, and this 
20110124205628.000|20110124205631.000|TR0|is a talking -- industry talking point.  
20110124205631.000|20110124205633.000|TR0|You know, again and again, again the press 
20110124205633.000|20110124205635.000|TR0|doesn't question.
20110124205635.000|20110124205638.000|TR0|
20110124205638.000|20110124205640.000|TR0|But the most recent study shows that for 
20110124205640.000|20110124205643.000|TR0|every dollar that coal brings to the state 
20110124205643.000|20110124205645.000|TR0|of West Virginia, the state loses $5 in 
20110124205645.000|20110124205647.000|TR0|subsidies and through other losses.  West 
20110124205647.000|20110124205650.000|TR0|Virginia, my father used to say, ought to 
20110124205650.000|20110124205652.000|TR0|be the richest state in the country 
20110124205652.000|20110124205654.000|TR0|because of the number of resources, the 
20110124205654.000|20110124205657.000|TR0|amount of resources in the state, but 
20110124205657.000|20110124205659.000|TR0|instead it's the 49th poorest state in the 
20110124205659.000|20110124205701.000|TR0|country.  It has some of the west health, 
20110124205701.000|20110124205704.000|TR0|and the closer you get to the coal fields, 
20110124205704.000|20110124205706.000|TR0|the poorer the people get.
20110124205706.000|20110124205709.000|TR0|
20110124205709.000|20110124205711.000|TR0|And 95 percent of the coal in West 
20110124205711.000|20110124205713.000|TR0|Virginia is owned by out-of- state 
20110124205713.000|20110124205716.000|TR0|interests and they have broken the unions 
20110124205716.000|20110124205718.000|TR0|so they are leaving nothing in that state 
20110124205718.000|20110124205720.000|TR0|except for denuded landscapes that will 
20110124205720.000|20110124205723.000|TR0|promise nothing but permanent poverty to 
20110124205723.000|20110124205725.000|TR0|the people of West Virginia.
20110124205725.000|20110124205728.000|TR0|
20110124205728.000|20110124205730.000|TR0|And in the meantime they are keeping 
20110124205730.000|20110124205732.000|TR0|sustainable industries out of the state 
20110124205732.000|20110124205735.000|TR0|because nobody is going to put a business 
20110124205735.000|20110124205737.000|TR0|in a state where they are dropping a bomb 
20110124205737.000|20110124205739.000|TR0|the size of the Hiroshima bomb once a week.
20110124205739.000|20110124205742.000|TR0|
20110124205742.000|20110124205744.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110124205744.000|20110124205747.000|TR0|
20110124205747.000|20110124205749.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  I hear the passion in both your 
20110124205749.000|20110124205751.000|TR0|voices and I'm just about out of time, and 
20110124205751.000|20110124205754.000|TR0|I just want to finally ask, Robert, 
20110124205754.000|20110124205756.000|TR0|documentary aside, you brought up your 
20110124205756.000|20110124205758.000|TR0|family, if I could ask quickly here about 
20110124205758.000|20110124205801.000|TR0|the passing of Sargent Shriver.  We 
20110124205801.000|20110124205803.000|TR0|covered it over the weekend, really made a 
20110124205803.000|20110124205806.000|TR0|career of political activism and service.  
20110124205806.000|20110124205808.000|TR0|And I'm just curious what message would he 
20110124205808.000|20110124205810.000|TR0|want to pass along, Robert, to America's 
20110124205810.000|20110124205813.000|TR0|youth?
20110124205813.000|20110124205815.000|TR0|
20110124205815.000|20110124205817.000|TR0|KENNEDY:  Well, you know, it's the same 
20110124205817.000|20110124205820.000|TR0|message that we try -- tried to get across 
20110124205820.000|20110124205822.000|TR0|in this film which is that you have to 
20110124205822.000|20110124205824.000|TR0|participate for the democracy to work, and 
20110124205824.000|20110124205827.000|TR0|if we don't participate, our democracy is 
20110124205827.000|20110124205829.000|TR0|going to end up in a place which is just 
20110124205829.000|20110124205832.000|TR0|like the kind of corporate kleptocracy, a 
20110124205832.000|20110124205834.000|TR0|feudal system that our ancestors fled from 
20110124205834.000|20110124205836.000|TR0|the United States to Europe to escape, and 
20110124205836.000|20110124205839.000|TR0|that's what happened in West Virginia. If 
20110124205839.000|20110124205841.000|TR0|you want to see a glimpse of the future 
20110124205841.000|20110124205843.000|TR0|that Sargent Shriver was fighting to 
20110124205843.000|20110124205846.000|TR0|avoid, go to West Virginia and see how the 
20110124205846.000|20110124205848.000|TR0|corporations are running that state and 
20110124205848.000|20110124205851.000|TR0|running it into the ground.
20110124205851.000|20110124205853.000|TR0|
20110124205853.000|20110124205855.000|TR0|HANEY:  And the kids who are fighting 
20110124205855.000|20110124205858.000|TR0|back, the kids who are coming from all 
20110124205858.000|20110124205900.000|TR0|over America in the green equivalent of 
20110124205900.000|20110124205902.000|TR0|Selma, hundreds of which have been 
20110124205902.000|20110124205905.000|TR0|arrested in West Virginia who are fighting 
20110124205905.000|20110124205907.000|TR0|just like the people in Sargent Shriver's 
20110124205907.000|20110124205910.000|TR0|generation did for the right to clean 
20110124205910.000|20110124205912.000|TR0|water and clean air.
20110124205912.000|20110124205914.000|TR0|
20110124205914.000|20110124205917.000|TR0|BALDWIN:  I understand.  They are fighting 
20110124205917.000|20110124205919.000|TR0|and can you see that fight is very evident 
20110124205919.000|20110124205921.000|TR0|in your documentary.  It is called "The 
20110124205921.000|20110124205924.000|TR0|Last Mountain." Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and 
20110124205924.000|20110124205926.000|TR0|Bill Haney, thank you so much.  I wish I 
20110124205926.000|20110124205929.000|TR0|had more time, but I do not.  Enjoy 
20110124205929.000|20110124205931.000|TR0|Sundance, both of you.
20110124205931.000|20110124205933.000|TR0|
20110124205933.000|20110124205936.000|TR0|And when we come back, I'm going to take 
20110124205936.000|20110124205938.000|TR0|you live to Russia for the very latest on 
20110124205938.000|20110124205940.000|TR0|today's mass airport bombing.  Stay there.
