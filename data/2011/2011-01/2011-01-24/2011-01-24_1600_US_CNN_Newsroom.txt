20110124160040.000|20110124160043.000|TR0|along with those 31 who were killed.  
20110124160043.000|20110124160045.000|TR0|Reuters and Russian news agencies say a 
20110124160045.000|20110124160048.000|TR0|suicide bomber carried out the attack in 
20110124160048.000|20110124160050.000|TR0|the baggage claim area.

20110124160105.000|20110124160107.000|TR0|of Fairport Harbor today.  It turns out it 
20110124160107.000|20110124160109.000|TR0|wasn't necessary, thank goodness.  Five 
20110124160109.000|20110124160112.000|TR0|houses and other buildings caught fire 
20110124160112.000|20110124160114.000|TR0|after a primary gas line ruptured.  But 
20110124160114.000|20110124160117.000|TR0|the fires are out, the gas turned off.

20110124160143.000|20110124160146.000|TR0|soon face a security screening to get 
20110124160146.000|20110124160148.000|TR0|inside a police precinct.  That's because 
20110124160148.000|20110124160151.000|TR0|a man opened fire inside a police station 
20110124160151.000|20110124160153.000|TR0|this weekend, wounding four officers.  
20110124160153.000|20110124160155.000|TR0|Police managed to shoot and kill the 
20110124160155.000|20110124160158.000|TR0|gunman.

20110124160212.000|20110124160215.000|TR0|POLICEMAN:  -- began firing.  And as you 
20110124160215.000|20110124160217.000|TR0|can imagine, I mean, utter chaos and 
20110124160217.000|20110124160220.000|TR0|pandemonium took place.
20110124160220.000|20110124160222.000|TR0|
20110124160222.000|20110124160225.000|TR0|But through it all, our officers 
20110124160225.000|20110124160227.000|TR0|maintained courageous calm, they returned 
20110124160227.000|20110124160229.000|TR0|fire, they took cover.  They did all the 
20110124160229.000|20110124160232.000|TR0|things that we train them to do under 
20110124160232.000|20110124160234.000|TR0|pressure.  And we're very fortunate.  
20110124160234.000|20110124160237.000|TR0|We're very blessed today to stand before 
20110124160237.000|20110124160239.000|TR0|you with the belief that all four of them 
20110124160239.000|20110124160241.000|TR0|will be OK.

20110124160256.000|20110124160258.000|TR0|dead, 130 wounded after an explosion at 
20110124160258.000|20110124160301.000|TR0|Moscow's main airport.  Russian President 
20110124160301.000|20110124160303.000|TR0|Dmitry Medvedev spoke about the tragedy a 
20110124160303.000|20110124160306.000|TR0|short time ago.

20110124160313.000|20110124160315.000|TR0|DMITRY MEDVEDEV, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
20110124160315.000|20110124160318.000|TR0|(through translator):  As for the 
20110124160318.000|20110124160320.000|TR0|investigation, we need to establish an 
20110124160320.000|20110124160323.000|TR0|investigation committee to perform as soon 
20110124160323.000|20110124160325.000|TR0|as possible all investigative actions on 
20110124160325.000|20110124160327.000|TR0|site.  I have ordered the Moscow mayor and 
20110124160327.000|20110124160330.000|TR0|the governor of the Moscow district to 
20110124160330.000|20110124160332.000|TR0|come there.  They're currently heading for 
20110124160332.000|20110124160335.000|TR0|the airport.  And we need to make -- to do 
20110124160335.000|20110124160337.000|TR0|everything we can to make sure all 
20110124160337.000|20110124160340.000|TR0|investigation -- investigative actions are 
20110124160340.000|20110124160342.000|TR0|carried out and all information is 
20110124160342.000|20110124160344.000|TR0|obtained.

20110124160352.000|20110124160354.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  CNN is getting pictures from 
20110124160354.000|20110124160357.000|TR0|that Moscow airport.  But they're so 
20110124160357.000|20110124160359.000|TR0|graphic, we're going through them.  When 
20110124160359.000|20110124160401.000|TR0|we find some suitable for air, of course 
20110124160401.000|20110124160404.000|TR0|we'll put them up for you.

20110124160406.000|20110124160409.000|TR0|Right now, Foreign Affairs Correspondent 
20110124160409.000|20110124160411.000|TR0|Jill Dougherty joins us.  She spent years 
20110124160411.000|20110124160413.000|TR0|in Russia.  She was the CNN Moscow Bureau 
20110124160413.000|20110124160416.000|TR0|Chief.
20110124160416.000|20110124160418.000|TR0|
20110124160418.000|20110124160421.000|TR0|And Jill, this is Moscow's busiest airport 
20110124160421.000|20110124160423.000|TR0|passenger-wise.  I know you've been in 
20110124160423.000|20110124160426.000|TR0|that airport a million times.  Where 
20110124160426.000|20110124160428.000|TR0|exactly did this explosion occur?
20110124160428.000|20110124160430.000|TR0|
20110124160430.000|20110124160433.000|TR0|JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
20110124160433.000|20110124160435.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is the 
20110124160435.000|20110124160438.000|TR0|question, Carol.  I mean, it appears that 
20110124160438.000|20110124160440.000|TR0|it happened outside of the security area.  
20110124160440.000|20110124160443.000|TR0|But, you know, that information is 
20110124160443.000|20110124160445.000|TR0|changing as we speak.
20110124160445.000|20110124160447.000|TR0|
20110124160447.000|20110124160450.000|TR0|But one thing you can say is it is a 
20110124160450.000|20110124160452.000|TR0|modern airport.  It was upgraded a few 
20110124160452.000|20110124160455.000|TR0|years ago.  It's really top notch in terms 
20110124160455.000|20110124160457.000|TR0|of security inside, it would appear.
20110124160457.000|20110124160459.000|TR0|
20110124160459.000|20110124160502.000|TR0|There are other areas where it may not be. 
20110124160502.000|20110124160504.000|TR0| And obviously something happened.
20110124160504.000|20110124160507.000|TR0|
20110124160507.000|20110124160509.000|TR0|And President Medvedev, just a few minutes 
20110124160509.000|20110124160512.000|TR0|ago, did say that some security laws are 
20110124160512.000|20110124160514.000|TR0|not working.  So he didn't elaborate on 
20110124160514.000|20110124160516.000|TR0|what that means, but obviously he appears 
20110124160516.000|20110124160519.000|TR0|to think that something was not being 
20110124160519.000|20110124160521.000|TR0|carried out the way it should be.
20110124160521.000|20110124160524.000|TR0|
20110124160524.000|20110124160526.000|TR0|And by the way, you know, Carol, I've been 
20110124160526.000|20110124160529.000|TR0|checking -- oh, go on, please.
20110124160529.000|20110124160531.000|TR0|
20110124160531.000|20110124160533.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  No, no.  I just want people to 
20110124160533.000|20110124160536.000|TR0|understand exactly what happened more.  
20110124160536.000|20110124160538.000|TR0|Was it a suicide bomber, or is it someone 
20110124160538.000|20110124160541.000|TR0|who set off a bomb in that area?
20110124160541.000|20110124160543.000|TR0|
20110124160543.000|20110124160545.000|TR0|DOUGHERTY:  Yes.  They believe that it was 
20110124160545.000|20110124160548.000|TR0|a suicide bomber.
20110124160548.000|20110124160550.000|TR0|
20110124160550.000|20110124160553.000|TR0|So you have this airport.  It's outside 
20110124160553.000|20110124160555.000|TR0|Moscow quite a bit, a very busy airport.  
20110124160555.000|20110124160558.000|TR0|It has domestic flights and international 
20110124160558.000|20110124160600.000|TR0|flights. And, as I said, a pretty 
20110124160600.000|20110124160602.000|TR0|sophisticated place.
20110124160602.000|20110124160605.000|TR0|
20110124160605.000|20110124160607.000|TR0|It appears that there was a suicide 
20110124160607.000|20110124160610.000|TR0|bomber.  They have immediately launched an 
20110124160610.000|20110124160612.000|TR0|investigation.  And it's a terrorism 
20110124160612.000|20110124160615.000|TR0|investigation.  So that is what they 
20110124160615.000|20110124160617.000|TR0|suspect right from the beginning.
20110124160617.000|20110124160619.000|TR0|
20110124160619.000|20110124160622.000|TR0|Also, you know, Carol, I've been checking 
20110124160622.000|20110124160624.000|TR0|some Web sites, and there's one radio 
20110124160624.000|20110124160627.000|TR0|station in Moscow that's a news radio, 
20110124160627.000|20110124160629.000|TR0|checking that Web site.  They have been -- 
20110124160629.000|20110124160631.000|TR0|the security and police, et cetera, have 
20110124160631.000|20110124160634.000|TR0|been checking security cameras, according 
20110124160634.000|20110124160636.000|TR0|to these media, and checking who looks 
20110124160636.000|20110124160639.000|TR0|familiar, who doesn't, is there anybody 
20110124160639.000|20110124160641.000|TR0|suspicious.  And that's one thing 
20110124160641.000|20110124160644.000|TR0|immediately that they are going to be 
20110124160644.000|20110124160646.000|TR0|doing.
20110124160646.000|20110124160648.000|TR0|
20110124160648.000|20110124160651.000|TR0|And the president sent, as you probably 
20110124160651.000|20110124160653.000|TR0|know, the mayor and the governor to that 
20110124160653.000|20110124160656.000|TR0|airport.  They will be, you know, 
20110124160656.000|20110124160658.000|TR0|supervising and hopefully getting to this 
20110124160658.000|20110124160701.000|TR0|investigation.  But the question still at 
20110124160701.000|20110124160703.000|TR0|this point is, who and why?
20110124160703.000|20110124160705.000|TR0|
20110124160705.000|20110124160708.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  I was just going to get into 
20110124160708.000|20110124160710.000|TR0|that, because when we say "terrorists," 
20110124160710.000|20110124160713.000|TR0|our mind always flips to one exact thing.  
20110124160713.000|20110124160715.000|TR0|But in Russia, when you say "terrorists," 
20110124160715.000|20110124160717.000|TR0|what does that usually mean?
20110124160717.000|20110124160720.000|TR0|
20110124160720.000|20110124160722.000|TR0|DOUGHERTY:  Terrorism in Russia usually 
20110124160722.000|20110124160725.000|TR0|means the caucuses, Chechnya. And 
20110124160725.000|20110124160727.000|TR0|although, you know, that hasn't been, at 
20110124160727.000|20110124160730.000|TR0|least in the West, a lot of news reports 
20110124160730.000|20110124160732.000|TR0|about that region, but it continues to 
20110124160732.000|20110124160734.000|TR0|fester.  And that would be the first -- 
20110124160734.000|20110124160737.000|TR0|the suspicion that Russian authorities 
20110124160737.000|20110124160739.000|TR0|would have, it would be certainly the 
20110124160739.000|20110124160742.000|TR0|first suspicion that Russian people would 
20110124160742.000|20110124160744.000|TR0|have.
20110124160744.000|20110124160747.000|TR0|
20110124160747.000|20110124160749.000|TR0|And then also, you have to put this 
20110124160749.000|20110124160751.000|TR0|together.  Perhaps there is no connection, 
20110124160751.000|20110124160754.000|TR0|but President Medvedev will be off on a 
20110124160754.000|20110124160756.000|TR0|very important trip this week to a very 
20110124160756.000|20110124160759.000|TR0|big economic summit in Davos, Switzerland, 
20110124160759.000|20110124160801.000|TR0|high profile.  And I'm sure carrying the 
20110124160801.000|20110124160803.000|TR0|message that Russia is a good place to 
20110124160803.000|20110124160806.000|TR0|invest, secure, et cetera.  And this 
20110124160806.000|20110124160808.000|TR0|obviously comes to the foreground in that 
20110124160808.000|20110124160811.000|TR0|type of trip.
20110124160811.000|20110124160813.000|TR0|
20110124160813.000|20110124160816.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Tell us a little more about the 
20110124160816.000|20110124160818.000|TR0|makeup of the caucuses, because some in 
20110124160818.000|20110124160820.000|TR0|Russia are saying this is an Islamic 
20110124160820.000|20110124160823.000|TR0|insurgency.  Tell us what that means.
20110124160823.000|20110124160825.000|TR0|
20110124160825.000|20110124160828.000|TR0|DOUGHERTY:  Well, increasingly, it has 
20110124160828.000|20110124160830.000|TR0|been.  I mean, the area that we're talking 
20110124160830.000|20110124160833.000|TR0|about is Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, 
20110124160833.000|20110124160835.000|TR0|areas near the caucuses mountains in the 
20110124160835.000|20110124160837.000|TR0|south of Russia.  And a lot of those areas 
20110124160837.000|20110124160840.000|TR0|are Muslim.
20110124160840.000|20110124160842.000|TR0|
20110124160842.000|20110124160845.000|TR0|Originally, it started out more as a 
20110124160845.000|20110124160847.000|TR0|separatist movement, but it has taken on 
20110124160847.000|20110124160849.000|TR0|an international significance, because, 
20110124160849.000|20110124160852.000|TR0|you know, some of the fighters that you 
20110124160852.000|20110124160854.000|TR0|find around the world in spots like 
20110124160854.000|20110124160857.000|TR0|Afghanistan, in Iraq, et cetera, were 
20110124160857.000|20110124160859.000|TR0|inspired -- I guess you could use the word 
20110124160859.000|20110124160902.000|TR0|-- by Russia's crackdown on their 
20110124160902.000|20110124160904.000|TR0|separatist movement a number of years ago. 
20110124160904.000|20110124160906.000|TR0|And so it continues to be an inspiration 
20110124160906.000|20110124160909.000|TR0|for terrorists around the world.
20110124160909.000|20110124160911.000|TR0|
20110124160911.000|20110124160914.000|TR0|Some of them have gone there.  Some of 
20110124160914.000|20110124160916.000|TR0|them want to go there.  And it's very much 
20110124160916.000|20110124160919.000|TR0|in the mix internationally.
20110124160919.000|20110124160921.000|TR0|
20110124160921.000|20110124160923.000|TR0|Now, for Russians, you have to go back -- 
20110124160923.000|20110124160926.000|TR0|I mean, for years they have been dealing 
20110124160926.000|20110124160928.000|TR0|-- really since the beginning of President 
20110124160928.000|20110124160931.000|TR0|Putin, when Putin was president -- with a 
20110124160931.000|20110124160933.000|TR0|number of terrorist attacks carried out by 
20110124160933.000|20110124160935.000|TR0|Chechens.  So, as I said, that would be 
20110124160935.000|20110124160938.000|TR0|the first suspicion.
20110124160938.000|20110124160940.000|TR0|
20110124160940.000|20110124160943.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  OK.  Jill, stick around.  
20110124160943.000|20110124160945.000|TR0|Matthew Chance is on the phone right now.  
20110124160945.000|20110124160948.000|TR0|He's on the way to that airport in Moscow.
20110124160948.000|20110124160950.000|TR0|
20110124160950.000|20110124160952.000|TR0|Matthew, what do you know?  What's the 
20110124160952.000|20110124160955.000|TR0|latest information?
20110124160955.000|20110124160957.000|TR0|
20110124160957.000|20110124161000.000|TR0|MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL 
20110124161000.000|20110124161002.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Carol.
20110124161002.000|20110124161005.000|TR0|
20110124161005.000|20110124161007.000|TR0|Well, information still very much 
20110124161007.000|20110124161009.000|TR0|trickling down to us here in the Russian 
20110124161009.000|20110124161012.000|TR0|capital.  There's transport chaos, I can 
20110124161012.000|20110124161014.000|TR0|tell you, in the center of the city.
20110124161014.000|20110124161017.000|TR0|
20110124161017.000|20110124161019.000|TR0|I'm in a car right now, as you mentioned, 
20110124161019.000|20110124161021.000|TR0|trying to get myself to Domodedovo 
20110124161021.000|20110124161024.000|TR0|Airport, which is about 25 miles or so 
20110124161024.000|20110124161026.000|TR0|outside of the city's center.  It's quite 
20110124161026.000|20110124161029.000|TR0|a distance away, actually.  And even on a 
20110124161029.000|20110124161031.000|TR0|day when something's happened -- I was 
20110124161031.000|20110124161034.000|TR0|discussing this with the driver -- it's 
20110124161034.000|20110124161036.000|TR0|difficult to get there, there's a lot of 
20110124161036.000|20110124161038.000|TR0|traffic, even on ordinary days.  But 
20110124161038.000|20110124161041.000|TR0|today, obviously, the roads apparently 
20110124161041.000|20110124161043.000|TR0|have been cut off as we approach the 
20110124161043.000|20110124161046.000|TR0|airport.
20110124161046.000|20110124161048.000|TR0|
20110124161048.000|20110124161051.000|TR0|We're trying to get closer, but in terms 
20110124161051.000|20110124161053.000|TR0|of what information we're getting, very 
20110124161053.000|20110124161055.000|TR0|difficult at the moment.  The latest 
20110124161055.000|20110124161058.000|TR0|figures we have are still the ones that 
20110124161058.000|20110124161100.000|TR0|you've been reporting within the past two 
20110124161100.000|20110124161103.000|TR0|minutes. Government officials are sticking 
20110124161103.000|20110124161105.000|TR0|with that figure of 31 people killed as a 
20110124161105.000|20110124161107.000|TR0|result of that apparent suicide bomber 
20110124161107.000|20110124161110.000|TR0|blast.
20110124161110.000|20110124161112.000|TR0|
20110124161112.000|20110124161115.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  And not only that, Matthew -- 
20110124161115.000|20110124161117.000|TR0|not only that, but 130 injured or more.  
20110124161117.000|20110124161120.000|TR0|We're getting in pictures from the airport 
20110124161120.000|20110124161122.000|TR0|right now.  They're very graphic pictures. 
20110124161122.000|20110124161124.000|TR0| We've gone through them.  We're going to 
20110124161124.000|20110124161127.000|TR0|put some up on the air.
20110124161127.000|20110124161129.000|TR0|
20110124161129.000|20110124161132.000|TR0|Tell us about -- you've been in that 
20110124161132.000|20110124161134.000|TR0|airport as well.  Tell us about the scene 
20110124161134.000|20110124161137.000|TR0|there and what it might look like, because 
20110124161137.000|20110124161139.000|TR0|I know you've been in contact with people 
20110124161139.000|20110124161141.000|TR0|there.
20110124161141.000|20110124161144.000|TR0|
20110124161144.000|20110124161146.000|TR0|CHANCELAM:  I can imagine -- I can just 
20110124161146.000|20110124161149.000|TR0|imagine it.  From what I've seen 
20110124161149.000|20110124161151.000|TR0|throughout my career, I can just imagine 
20110124161151.000|20110124161153.000|TR0|what it would be like to explode a suicide 
20110124161153.000|20110124161156.000|TR0|bomb in an airport as crowded as that on a 
20110124161156.000|20110124161158.000|TR0|night like this, when so many thousands of 
20110124161158.000|20110124161201.000|TR0|people, Russians and, of course, people 
20110124161201.000|20110124161203.000|TR0|from around the world as well, that use 
20110124161203.000|20110124161206.000|TR0|Domodedovo as the main point of access in 
20110124161206.000|20110124161208.000|TR0|and out of Russia, business people, 
20110124161208.000|20110124161210.000|TR0|tourists, people seeing friends and family 
20110124161210.000|20110124161213.000|TR0|and loved ones.  And I think in this area 
20110124161213.000|20110124161215.000|TR0|where the explosion took place -- and we 
20110124161215.000|20110124161218.000|TR0|don't have that confirmed yet, but it 
20110124161218.000|20110124161220.000|TR0|seems to be in the location of a coffee 
20110124161220.000|20110124161223.000|TR0|shop called Cafe Asia (ph), which is just 
20110124161223.000|20110124161225.000|TR0|as you come out of international baggage 
20110124161225.000|20110124161227.000|TR0|reclaim.
20110124161227.000|20110124161230.000|TR0|
20110124161230.000|20110124161232.000|TR0|You come out as you, as you do so often in 
20110124161232.000|20110124161235.000|TR0|these airports, and you're confronted by a 
20110124161235.000|20110124161237.000|TR0|wall of taxi drivers who are touting for 
20110124161237.000|20110124161240.000|TR0|your business, trying to get you into 
20110124161240.000|20110124161242.000|TR0|their car so they can drive you into town. 
20110124161242.000|20110124161244.000|TR0| And it's a very narrow part of the 
20110124161244.000|20110124161247.000|TR0|airport as well.
20110124161247.000|20110124161249.000|TR0|
20110124161249.000|20110124161252.000|TR0|And so people are very tightly packed.  
20110124161252.000|20110124161254.000|TR0|There's usually hundreds of people in that 
20110124161254.000|20110124161256.000|TR0|hall waiting for loved ones, taxi drivers 
20110124161256.000|20110124161259.000|TR0|as well.
20110124161259.000|20110124161301.000|TR0|
20110124161301.000|20110124161304.000|TR0|And so, if it is, indeed, a suicide bomb 
20110124161304.000|20110124161306.000|TR0|that's been detonated in that area, it 
20110124161306.000|20110124161309.000|TR0|will be absolutely catastrophic.  And I 
20110124161309.000|20110124161311.000|TR0|think that's why we're seeing such high 
20110124161311.000|20110124161313.000|TR0|casualty figures, 31 dead, 130 injured.
20110124161313.000|20110124161316.000|TR0|
20110124161316.000|20110124161318.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  And if it is right there in 
20110124161318.000|20110124161321.000|TR0|that particular spot in the airport, 
20110124161321.000|20110124161323.000|TR0|Matthew -- I'm just comparing it to 
20110124161323.000|20110124161326.000|TR0|airports here in the United States -- 
20110124161326.000|20110124161328.000|TR0|there really isn't much of a security 
20110124161328.000|20110124161330.000|TR0|presence in that particular area.  Is that 
20110124161330.000|20110124161333.000|TR0|true as well in Moscow?
20110124161333.000|20110124161335.000|TR0|
20110124161335.000|20110124161338.000|TR0|CHANCELAM:  Yes.  It's the place you go to 
20110124161338.000|20110124161340.000|TR0|when you're picking up somebody who's 
20110124161340.000|20110124161342.000|TR0|arrived from an international flight.  You 
20110124161342.000|20110124161345.000|TR0|go there, you wait outside the sliding 
20110124161345.000|20110124161347.000|TR0|doors.  You've got a barrier keeping you 
20110124161347.000|20110124161350.000|TR0|back from (INAUDIBLE).
20110124161350.000|20110124161352.000|TR0|
20110124161352.000|20110124161355.000|TR0|But the doors open, and then the people 
20110124161355.000|20110124161357.000|TR0|come through.  And there's hugs, there's 
20110124161357.000|20110124161359.000|TR0|kisses.  There's taxi drivers confronting 
20110124161359.000|20110124161402.000|TR0|you.  You know, and so it's exactly that 
20110124161402.000|20110124161404.000|TR0|kind of situation that exists -- places 
20110124161404.000|20110124161407.000|TR0|that exist in virtually big, modern 
20110124161407.000|20110124161409.000|TR0|international airport in the world that 
20110124161409.000|20110124161412.000|TR0|I've traveled through.
20110124161412.000|20110124161414.000|TR0|
20110124161414.000|20110124161416.000|TR0|You're right, security to get there, as 
20110124161416.000|20110124161419.000|TR0|you'll know, as you've gone into an 
20110124161419.000|20110124161421.000|TR0|international airport just as a regular 
20110124161421.000|20110124161424.000|TR0|civilian, not as a passenger, it's not 
20110124161424.000|20110124161426.000|TR0|that tight.  Of course there are patrols 
20110124161426.000|20110124161428.000|TR0|of police.  Of course there are security 
20110124161428.000|20110124161431.000|TR0|cameras.
20110124161431.000|20110124161433.000|TR0|
20110124161433.000|20110124161436.000|TR0|But I think what Jill Dougherty was 
20110124161436.000|20110124161438.000|TR0|reporting, and I feel I can confirm this 
20110124161438.000|20110124161441.000|TR0|as well, is that what tends to happen is 
20110124161441.000|20110124161443.000|TR0|they tend to scan your bag when you go in 
20110124161443.000|20110124161445.000|TR0|and not your actual personage.  They don't 
20110124161445.000|20110124161448.000|TR0|tend to put you through a metal detector, 
20110124161448.000|20110124161450.000|TR0|just your bag.
20110124161450.000|20110124161453.000|TR0|
20110124161453.000|20110124161455.000|TR0|And I can tell you from experience, not 
20110124161455.000|20110124161458.000|TR0|even your bag sometimes. Sometimes you 
20110124161458.000|20110124161500.000|TR0|just walk straight through until you get 
20110124161500.000|20110124161502.000|TR0|to check-in, and then after that you have 
20110124161502.000|20110124161505.000|TR0|to go through very intense security.  But 
20110124161505.000|20110124161507.000|TR0|of course you wouldn't have to go through 
20110124161507.000|20110124161510.000|TR0|that security if you're just going to meet 
20110124161510.000|20110124161512.000|TR0|somebody from an aircraft.  And so if it 
20110124161512.000|20110124161514.000|TR0|is a suicide bomber, or somebody with a 
20110124161514.000|20110124161517.000|TR0|bomb that's planted it there, they perhaps 
20110124161517.000|20110124161519.000|TR0|would not have had to go through most 
20110124161519.000|20110124161522.000|TR0|areas (ph) of the security enforced at 
20110124161522.000|20110124161524.000|TR0|Domodedovo.
20110124161524.000|20110124161527.000|TR0|
20110124161527.000|20110124161529.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Matthew Chance, we're going to 
20110124161529.000|20110124161531.000|TR0|let you head to the airport. You're 
20110124161531.000|20110124161534.000|TR0|heading to the airport right now.  When 
20110124161534.000|20110124161536.000|TR0|you get there, we'll rejoin you live.
20110124161536.000|20110124161539.000|TR0|
20110124161539.000|20110124161541.000|TR0|Again, a suicide bombing in a Moscow 
20110124161541.000|20110124161544.000|TR0|airport, the third largest in Russia.  
20110124161544.000|20110124161546.000|TR0|Thirty-one people dead, 130 injured or 
20110124161546.000|20110124161548.000|TR0|more.
20110124161548.000|20110124161551.000|TR0|
20110124161551.000|20110124161553.000|TR0|When we get more, we'll get it to you.
20110124161553.000|20110124161556.000|TR0|
20110124161556.000|20110124161558.000|TR0|We're going to take a quick break.  We'll 
20110124161558.000|20110124161600.000|TR0|be right back.
20110124161600.000|20110124161603.000|TR0|

20110124161605.000|20110124161608.000|TR0|
20110124161608.000|20110124161610.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  A woman accused of snatching a 
20110124161610.000|20110124161613.000|TR0|baby from a New York hospital more than 
20110124161613.000|20110124161615.000|TR0|two decades ago is due in court this 
20110124161615.000|20110124161617.000|TR0|morning.  The stolen baby is now 23 years 
20110124161617.000|20110124161620.000|TR0|old.  She's reunited with her biological 
20110124161620.000|20110124161622.000|TR0|family after essentially solving the case 
20110124161622.000|20110124161625.000|TR0|herself.  The woman accused of taking her 
20110124161625.000|20110124161627.000|TR0|is expected to face federal kidnapping 
20110124161627.000|20110124161630.000|TR0|charges.

20110124161632.000|20110124161634.000|TR0|Let's bring in National Correspondent 
20110124161634.000|20110124161637.000|TR0|Susan Candiotti.  She's outside the 
20110124161637.000|20110124161639.000|TR0|courthouse in New York.
20110124161639.000|20110124161642.000|TR0|
20110124161642.000|20110124161644.000|TR0|Susan, how did the suspect -- her name is 
20110124161644.000|20110124161646.000|TR0|Ann Pettway -- how did she end up in 
20110124161646.000|20110124161649.000|TR0|custody?
20110124161649.000|20110124161651.000|TR0|
20110124161651.000|20110124161654.000|TR0|SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN NATIONAL 
20110124161654.000|20110124161656.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we actually talked 
20110124161656.000|20110124161659.000|TR0|about some exclusive details about how -- 
20110124161659.000|20110124161701.000|TR0|the circumstances under which she turned 
20110124161701.000|20110124161703.000|TR0|herself in on Sunday.  And now we have 
20110124161703.000|20110124161706.000|TR0|even more information about that.
20110124161706.000|20110124161708.000|TR0|
20110124161708.000|20110124161711.000|TR0|It turns out, according to a law 
20110124161711.000|20110124161713.000|TR0|enforcement source, that she contacted a 
20110124161713.000|20110124161716.000|TR0|Bridgeport Police officer that she knew 
20110124161716.000|20110124161718.000|TR0|via his personal Facebook page on Sunday.  
20110124161718.000|20110124161720.000|TR0|Then a meeting was arranged for her to 
20110124161720.000|20110124161723.000|TR0|turn herself in.  So with the assistance 
20110124161723.000|20110124161725.000|TR0|of the Bridgeport Police Department, she 
20110124161725.000|20110124161728.000|TR0|then contacted the FBI and she turned 
20110124161728.000|20110124161730.000|TR0|herself in to the FBI on Sunday.
20110124161730.000|20110124161732.000|TR0|
20110124161732.000|20110124161735.000|TR0|Now, she is expected to be making her very 
20110124161735.000|20110124161737.000|TR0|first court appearance here in New York 
20110124161737.000|20110124161740.000|TR0|City.  She was brought here last night on 
20110124161740.000|20110124161742.000|TR0|federal kidnapping charges.  This will be 
20110124161742.000|20110124161745.000|TR0|her first appearance in court.  It should 
20110124161745.000|20110124161747.000|TR0|be a very short hearing.
20110124161747.000|20110124161749.000|TR0|
20110124161749.000|20110124161752.000|TR0|But the real break in this case appeared 
20110124161752.000|20110124161754.000|TR0|to come on Saturday, when there was a 
20110124161754.000|20110124161757.000|TR0|sighting of Ann Pettway as she went to a 
20110124161757.000|20110124161759.000|TR0|pawnshop in Bridgeport, Connecticut, 
20110124161759.000|20110124161802.000|TR0|trying to sell some of her jewelry.  She 
20110124161802.000|20110124161804.000|TR0|didn't like the price she got, so she 
20110124161804.000|20110124161806.000|TR0|quickly left.  But an alert employee then 
20110124161806.000|20110124161809.000|TR0|contacted the police after recognizing her 
20110124161809.000|20110124161811.000|TR0|from media reports.
20110124161811.000|20110124161814.000|TR0|
20110124161814.000|20110124161816.000|TR0|Here's how police confirmed that it was 
20110124161816.000|20110124161818.000|TR0|her.

20110124161828.000|20110124161831.000|TR0|DEPT.:  They were able to obtain some 
20110124161831.000|20110124161833.000|TR0|video surveillance from the store.  And 
20110124161833.000|20110124161835.000|TR0|based on what they observed and what -- 
20110124161835.000|20110124161838.000|TR0|the photographs that we had of her, they 
20110124161838.000|20110124161840.000|TR0|confirmed, in fact, that it was her in 
20110124161840.000|20110124161843.000|TR0|question.

20110124161845.000|20110124161848.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  And she came in by herself?
20110124161848.000|20110124161850.000|TR0|
20110124161850.000|20110124161852.000|TR0|BRYANT:  She came in by herself, yes.  And 
20110124161852.000|20110124161855.000|TR0|she turned around and she left on foot.
20110124161855.000|20110124161857.000|TR0|
20110124161857.000|20110124161900.000|TR0|The clerk advised the detectives that he 
20110124161900.000|20110124161902.000|TR0|didn't observe her get into a car.  He 
20110124161902.000|20110124161904.000|TR0|immediately jumped on the telephone and 
20110124161904.000|20110124161907.000|TR0|called the police department, made them 
20110124161907.000|20110124161909.000|TR0|aware of his sightings.
20110124161909.000|20110124161912.000|TR0|
20110124161912.000|20110124161914.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP) CANDIOTTI:  Of course, 
20110124161914.000|20110124161917.000|TR0|finally, there may be an opportunity for 
20110124161917.000|20110124161919.000|TR0|everyone involved in this case, 
20110124161919.000|20110124161921.000|TR0|particularly Carlina White and her birth 
20110124161921.000|20110124161924.000|TR0|mother, to find out exactly why, as this 
20110124161924.000|20110124161926.000|TR0|case rolls along, why this happened to 
20110124161926.000|20110124161929.000|TR0|begin with, why she was snatched as a baby 
20110124161929.000|20110124161931.000|TR0|back in 1987, when she was only 19 days 
20110124161931.000|20110124161934.000|TR0|old.
20110124161934.000|20110124161936.000|TR0|
20110124161936.000|20110124161938.000|TR0|Back to you.
20110124161938.000|20110124161941.000|TR0|
20110124161941.000|20110124161943.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  We're not likely to find out 
20110124161943.000|20110124161946.000|TR0|much about that in court today, right, 
20110124161946.000|20110124161948.000|TR0|Susan?
20110124161948.000|20110124161950.000|TR0|
20110124161950.000|20110124161953.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  No.  This is really a very 
20110124161953.000|20110124161955.000|TR0|normal hearing.  It should only last a few 
20110124161955.000|20110124161958.000|TR0|minutes.  It's just to acknowledge that 
20110124161958.000|20110124162000.000|TR0|she is there. They'll probably quickly set 
20110124162000.000|20110124162003.000|TR0|a date for when she will have a bond 
20110124162003.000|20110124162005.000|TR0|hearing, a detention hearing, and then 
20110124162005.000|20110124162007.000|TR0|it'll roll on from there.

20110124162010.000|20110124162012.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Susan Candiotti reporting live 
20110124162012.000|20110124162015.000|TR0|from New York today.
20110124162015.000|20110124162017.000|TR0|
20110124162017.000|20110124162020.000|TR0|Thank you.
20110124162020.000|20110124162022.000|TR0|
20110124162022.000|20110124162024.000|TR0|The young man charged in the Tucson 
20110124162024.000|20110124162027.000|TR0|shooting rampage heads to federal court 
20110124162027.000|20110124162029.000|TR0|today, too, for arraignment.  Jared 
20110124162029.000|20110124162032.000|TR0|Loughner will answer to three counts of 
20110124162032.000|20110124162034.000|TR0|attempted murder this afternoon.  He'll 
20110124162034.000|20110124162036.000|TR0|appear before a California judge sitting 
20110124162036.000|20110124162039.000|TR0|in Phoenix.  Arizona judges recused 
20110124162039.000|20110124162041.000|TR0|themselves because one of their colleagues 
20110124162041.000|20110124162044.000|TR0|was among the victims. Prosecutors are 
20110124162044.000|20110124162046.000|TR0|expected to push for murder indictments 
20110124162046.000|20110124162049.000|TR0|later.
20110124162049.000|20110124162051.000|TR0|
20110124162051.000|20110124162053.000|TR0|Doctors say full-fledged rehabilitation 
20110124162053.000|20110124162056.000|TR0|for Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords will 
20110124162056.000|20110124162058.000|TR0|wait because fluid is building on her 
20110124162058.000|20110124162101.000|TR0|brain.

20110124162103.000|20110124162106.000|TR0|Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth 
20110124162106.000|20110124162108.000|TR0|Cohen joins me now to kind of take us 
20110124162108.000|20110124162110.000|TR0|through what's happening with 
20110124162110.000|20110124162113.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords.
20110124162113.000|20110124162115.000|TR0|
20110124162115.000|20110124162118.000|TR0|I guess this isn't so uncommon, Elizabeth, 
20110124162118.000|20110124162120.000|TR0|is it?
20110124162120.000|20110124162122.000|TR0|
20110124162122.000|20110124162125.000|TR0|ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SR. MEDICAL 
20110124162125.000|20110124162127.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  No, it's not uncommon at 
20110124162127.000|20110124162130.000|TR0|all.  Doctors tell me this actually 
20110124162130.000|20110124162132.000|TR0|happens quite frequently with people with 
20110124162132.000|20110124162135.000|TR0|this kind of an injury.
20110124162135.000|20110124162137.000|TR0|
20110124162137.000|20110124162139.000|TR0|Let me tell you what her brain -- what 
20110124162139.000|20110124162142.000|TR0|sort of is going on here.
20110124162142.000|20110124162144.000|TR0|
20110124162144.000|20110124162147.000|TR0|This is the way a normal brain would look. 
20110124162147.000|20110124162149.000|TR0| You have some fluid.  You see it there in 
20110124162149.000|20110124162152.000|TR0|blue, Carol.  And here you have a buildup 
20110124162152.000|20110124162154.000|TR0|of more fluid after an injury like the one 
20110124162154.000|20110124162156.000|TR0|that she had.
20110124162156.000|20110124162159.000|TR0|
20110124162159.000|20110124162201.000|TR0|And this pink around here is swelling, and 
20110124162201.000|20110124162204.000|TR0|that puts pressure on the brain.  That's 
20110124162204.000|20110124162206.000|TR0|obviously not a good thing.  So what they 
20110124162206.000|20110124162208.000|TR0|do is they drain it.  They just literally 
20110124162208.000|20110124162211.000|TR0|put a pipe in there and drain it so that 
20110124162211.000|20110124162213.000|TR0|it drains outside her body to take some of 
20110124162213.000|20110124162216.000|TR0|that pressure away -- Carol.
20110124162216.000|20110124162218.000|TR0|
20110124162218.000|20110124162221.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  See, that sounds absolutely 
20110124162221.000|20110124162223.000|TR0|awful to me.  But it's a common procedure 
20110124162223.000|20110124162225.000|TR0|that they do all the time?  It's something 
20110124162225.000|20110124162228.000|TR0|they're not worried about?
20110124162228.000|20110124162230.000|TR0|
20110124162230.000|20110124162233.000|TR0|COHEN:  No.  It's something they do all 
20110124162233.000|20110124162235.000|TR0|the time, and it's something that keeps 
20110124162235.000|20110124162238.000|TR0|you in the intensive care unit.  That's 
20110124162238.000|20110124162240.000|TR0|the thing.
20110124162240.000|20110124162242.000|TR0|
20110124162242.000|20110124162245.000|TR0|When you have something going into your 
20110124162245.000|20110124162247.000|TR0|brain from the outside, that can 
20110124162247.000|20110124162250.000|TR0|relatively easily get infected.  And so 
20110124162250.000|20110124162252.000|TR0|they do want to get this out as soon as 
20110124162252.000|20110124162254.000|TR0|possible.  You can't live forever with a 
20110124162254.000|20110124162257.000|TR0|drain going from your brain to the 
20110124162257.000|20110124162259.000|TR0|outside.  It just could get infected too 
20110124162259.000|20110124162302.000|TR0|easily.
20110124162302.000|20110124162304.000|TR0|
20110124162304.000|20110124162307.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Oh, my gosh.
20110124162307.000|20110124162309.000|TR0|
20110124162309.000|20110124162311.000|TR0|Despite all this, she's making remarkable 
20110124162311.000|20110124162314.000|TR0|progress, right?
20110124162314.000|20110124162316.000|TR0|
20110124162316.000|20110124162319.000|TR0|COHEN:  Right.  Doctors say she really is 
20110124162319.000|20110124162321.000|TR0|doing quite well.
20110124162321.000|20110124162324.000|TR0|
20110124162324.000|20110124162326.000|TR0|She still can't speak.  She still can't 
20110124162326.000|20110124162328.000|TR0|stand up on her own.  But they're really 
20110124162328.000|20110124162331.000|TR0|quite impressed with the strength on her 
20110124162331.000|20110124162333.000|TR0|left-hand side.
20110124162333.000|20110124162336.000|TR0|
20110124162336.000|20110124162338.000|TR0|And I spoke over the weekend to Dr. Gerard 
20110124162338.000|20110124162340.000|TR0|Francisco, one of her doctors in Texas.  
20110124162340.000|20110124162343.000|TR0|Let's take a listen to what he had to say.
20110124162343.000|20110124162345.000|TR0|
20110124162345.000|20110124162348.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110124162348.000|20110124162350.000|TR0|
20110124162350.000|20110124162353.000|TR0|DR. GERARD FRANCISCO, TIRR MEMORIAL 
20110124162353.000|20110124162355.000|TR0|HERMANN:  At one point her leg was 
20110124162355.000|20110124162357.000|TR0|dangling in the bed, and we asked her to 
20110124162357.000|20110124162400.000|TR0|bring her leg up.  After a couple of 
20110124162400.000|20110124162402.000|TR0|seconds, she brought the left leg up 
20110124162402.000|20110124162405.000|TR0|without any further delay.
20110124162405.000|20110124162407.000|TR0|
20110124162407.000|20110124162410.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110124162410.000|20110124162412.000|TR0|
20110124162412.000|20110124162414.000|TR0|COHEN:  So, to bring the leg from a 
20110124162414.000|20110124162417.000|TR0|dangling position up on to the bed sounds 
20110124162417.000|20110124162419.000|TR0|so small, Carol.  But really, it is a 
20110124162419.000|20110124162422.000|TR0|very, very good sign. And while she can't 
20110124162422.000|20110124162424.000|TR0|go into full-time rehab yet, she does have 
20110124162424.000|20110124162427.000|TR0|a couple of hours of physical therapy 
20110124162427.000|20110124162429.000|TR0|every day.
20110124162429.000|20110124162431.000|TR0|
20110124162431.000|20110124162434.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  When she finally makes it into 
20110124162434.000|20110124162436.000|TR0|rehab -- and we hope it's soon -- how long 
20110124162436.000|20110124162439.000|TR0|is her road to recovery?
20110124162439.000|20110124162441.000|TR0|
20110124162441.000|20110124162443.000|TR0|COHEN:  You know, it's measured not in 
20110124162443.000|20110124162446.000|TR0|days, not in weeks, but in months.  I 
20110124162446.000|20110124162448.000|TR0|mean, four to six months.  It could even 
20110124162448.000|20110124162451.000|TR0|be longer than that.
20110124162451.000|20110124162453.000|TR0|
20110124162453.000|20110124162456.000|TR0|I spoke to a policeman who had a very 
20110124162456.000|20110124162458.000|TR0|similar injury to hers.  And three years 
20110124162458.000|20110124162500.000|TR0|later, he's still undergoing physical

20110124162503.000|20110124162505.000|TR0|he's always looking to get even better.
20110124162505.000|20110124162508.000|TR0|
20110124162508.000|20110124162510.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  All right.  Elizabeth Cohen, 
20110124162510.000|20110124162513.000|TR0|thanks for making it clear for us.  We 
20110124162513.000|20110124162515.000|TR0|appreciate it.

20110124162525.000|20110124162527.000|TR0|House now, because President Obama is 
20110124162527.000|20110124162529.000|TR0|speaking, along with his wife.  The 
20110124162529.000|20110124162532.000|TR0|president and the first lady are outlining 
20110124162532.000|20110124162534.000|TR0|new ways for the government to support 
20110124162534.000|20110124162537.000|TR0|U.S. military families.
20110124162537.000|20110124162539.000|TR0|
20110124162539.000|20110124162542.000|TR0|Let's listen to the president.  (JOINED IN

20110124162546.000|20110124162549.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20110124162549.000|20110124162551.000|TR0|STATES:  Now, for those of you who aren't 
20110124162551.000|20110124162554.000|TR0|familiar with these presidential 
20110124162554.000|20110124162556.000|TR0|directives, these are reserved for some of 
20110124162556.000|20110124162559.000|TR0|the most important and complex national 
20110124162559.000|20110124162601.000|TR0|security challenges.  I think Mike Mullen 
20110124162601.000|20110124162603.000|TR0|will share with you, since becoming 
20110124162603.000|20110124162606.000|TR0|president, I've only ordered about a 
20110124162606.000|20110124162608.000|TR0|dozen, including this one, which we 
20110124162608.000|20110124162611.000|TR0|believe is the first one ever on behalf of 
20110124162611.000|20110124162613.000|TR0|military families.
20110124162613.000|20110124162615.000|TR0|
20110124162615.000|20110124162618.000|TR0|And today I'm proud to announce that for 
20110124162618.000|20110124162620.000|TR0|the first time ever, supporting the 
20110124162620.000|20110124162623.000|TR0|well-being of our military families will 
20110124162623.000|20110124162625.000|TR0|be a priority not just for the Department 
20110124162625.000|20110124162628.000|TR0|of Defense, the Department of Veterans 
20110124162628.000|20110124162630.000|TR0|Affairs, but all across the federal 
20110124162630.000|20110124162632.000|TR0|government.  That's why all these cabinet 
20110124162632.000|20110124162635.000|TR0|folks are here today.
20110124162635.000|20110124162637.000|TR0|
20110124162637.000|20110124162640.000|TR0|Sixteen members of my cabinet have 
20110124162640.000|20110124162642.000|TR0|committed their departments and agencies 
20110124162642.000|20110124162645.000|TR0|to making military families one of their 
20110124162645.000|20110124162647.000|TR0|highest priorities. And we're focusing on 
20110124162647.000|20110124162649.000|TR0|four areas, the things you said mattered 
20110124162649.000|20110124162652.000|TR0|most to you, whether you're Army, Navy, 
20110124162652.000|20110124162654.000|TR0|Air Force, Marine or Coast Guard, active 
20110124162654.000|20110124162657.000|TR0|Guard or Reserve, a veteran or a member of 
20110124162657.000|20110124162659.000|TR0|a family of a fallen.
20110124162659.000|20110124162701.000|TR0|
20110124162701.000|20110124162704.000|TR0|We didn't wait for today to launch these 
20110124162704.000|20110124162706.000|TR0|efforts.  Many of these efforts have 
20110124162706.000|20110124162709.000|TR0|already been under way, and that includes 
20110124162709.000|20110124162711.000|TR0|innovative new partnerships so that in 
20110124162711.000|20110124162714.000|TR0|tough fiscal times, our government is more 
20110124162714.000|20110124162716.000|TR0|efficient and serves you better.
20110124162716.000|20110124162718.000|TR0|
20110124162718.000|20110124162721.000|TR0|Let me just list our primary areas of 
20110124162721.000|20110124162723.000|TR0|focus.
20110124162723.000|20110124162726.000|TR0|
20110124162726.000|20110124162728.000|TR0|First, we are putting new emphasis on the 
20110124162728.000|20110124162731.000|TR0|quality of life for our military families. 
20110124162731.000|20110124162733.000|TR0| The Departments of Defense and Health and 
20110124162733.000|20110124162735.000|TR0|Human Services, for example, have joined 
20110124162735.000|20110124162738.000|TR0|forces to improve community mental health 
20110124162738.000|20110124162740.000|TR0|services and prevent suicides.
20110124162740.000|20110124162743.000|TR0|
20110124162743.000|20110124162745.000|TR0|A new office in the Treasury Department is 
20110124162745.000|20110124162747.000|TR0|working to protect military families from 
20110124162747.000|20110124162750.000|TR0|abusive practices like predatory lending.  
20110124162750.000|20110124162752.000|TR0|It turns out that military families are 
20110124162752.000|20110124162755.000|TR0|more subject to some of these financial 
20110124162755.000|20110124162757.000|TR0|scams than just about any other group.
20110124162757.000|20110124162800.000|TR0|
20110124162800.000|20110124162802.000|TR0|The Agricultural Department is expanding 
20110124162802.000|20110124162804.000|TR0|its support for families in rural areas.  
20110124162804.000|20110124162807.000|TR0|A disproportionate number of our military 
20110124162807.000|20110124162809.000|TR0|families come from rural areas, or are 
20110124162809.000|20110124162812.000|TR0|stationed in rural communities.
20110124162812.000|20110124162814.000|TR0|
20110124162814.000|20110124162817.000|TR0|The Interior Department -- we --

20110124162819.000|20110124162821.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Let's step away from the 
20110124162821.000|20110124162824.000|TR0|president right now.  This isn't over.
20110124162824.000|20110124162826.000|TR0|
20110124162826.000|20110124162829.000|TR0|On Thursday, Michelle Obama will appear on 
20110124162829.000|20110124162831.000|TR0|"The Oprah Winfrey Show" to talk about 
20110124162831.000|20110124162833.000|TR0|what else the United States can do to help 
20110124162833.000|20110124162836.000|TR0|military families.
20110124162836.000|20110124162838.000|TR0|
20110124162838.000|20110124162841.000|TR0|We're going to toss to a quick break.  
20110124162841.000|20110124162843.000|TR0|We'll be right back.

20110124162850.000|20110124162853.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Again, we're following breaking 
20110124162853.000|20110124162855.000|TR0|news out of Moscow.
20110124162855.000|20110124162858.000|TR0|
20110124162858.000|20110124162900.000|TR0|In Moscow's busiest passenger airport, a 
20110124162900.000|20110124162903.000|TR0|suicide bomber set off an explosion that 
20110124162903.000|20110124162905.000|TR0|killed 31 people and injured more than 100 
20110124162905.000|20110124162907.000|TR0|people. That explosion, we believe, ripped 
20110124162907.000|20110124162910.000|TR0|through a baggage claim area.
20110124162910.000|20110124162912.000|TR0|
20110124162912.000|20110124162915.000|TR0|We've been getting in video over the past 
20110124162915.000|20110124162917.000|TR0|30 minutes.  And as you can see, some of 
20110124162917.000|20110124162919.000|TR0|it is disturbing.  We've been screening 
20110124162919.000|20110124162922.000|TR0|it.  We just wanted to show you a bit of 
20110124162922.000|20110124162924.000|TR0|what it looked like inside that Moscow 
20110124162924.000|20110124162927.000|TR0|airport.
20110124162927.000|20110124162929.000|TR0|
20110124162929.000|20110124162932.000|TR0|We've also just learned that the Russian 
20110124162932.000|20110124162934.000|TR0|president has postponed his trip to the 
20110124162934.000|20110124162936.000|TR0|World Economic Forum in Davos, 
20110124162936.000|20110124162939.000|TR0|Switzerland, because of the bombing.  And 
20110124162939.000|20110124162941.000|TR0|that's according to Kremlin officials, and 
20110124162941.000|20110124162944.000|TR0|that's what they told us just a short time 
20110124162944.000|20110124162946.000|TR0|ago.

20110124162949.000|20110124162951.000|TR0|President Obama assesses the state of the 
20110124162951.000|20110124162953.000|TR0|economy in his "State of the Union" speech 
20110124162953.000|20110124162956.000|TR0|tomorrow night.  He says jobs will be the 
20110124162956.000|20110124162958.000|TR0|main focus, along with revving up the 
20110124162958.000|20110124163001.000|TR0|economy in general.  The president says he 
20110124163001.000|20110124163003.000|TR0|might also include a call for 
20110124163003.000|20110124163005.000|TR0|bipartisanship and civility.
20110124163005.000|20110124163008.000|TR0|
20110124163008.000|20110124163010.000|TR0|He gave supporters a preview of the speech

20110124163022.000|20110124163025.000|TR0|the economy is working for everybody, for 
20110124163025.000|20110124163027.000|TR0|the entire American family.  How do we 
20110124163027.000|20110124163030.000|TR0|make sure that people have good jobs with 
20110124163030.000|20110124163032.000|TR0|good benefits?  How do we make sure that 
20110124163032.000|20110124163035.000|TR0|somebody who has a good idea can suddenly 
20110124163035.000|20110124163037.000|TR0|start a business?  How are we going to 
20110124163037.000|20110124163039.000|TR0|make sure that we have the most 
20110124163039.000|20110124163042.000|TR0|innovative, dynamic economy in the world?  
20110124163042.000|20110124163044.000|TR0|And how do we make sure that our kids are 
20110124163044.000|20110124163047.000|TR0|able to compete with workers anywhere in

20110124163051.000|20110124163054.000|TR0|Now, to do that we're going to have to

20110124163116.000|20110124163118.000|TR0|on the state of the union and the economy, 
20110124163118.000|20110124163121.000|TR0|and then lawmakers put their spin on it.  
20110124163121.000|20110124163123.000|TR0|But what is the state of the union when it 
20110124163123.000|20110124163125.000|TR0|comes to, let's say, housing?
20110124163125.000|20110124163128.000|TR0|
20110124163128.000|20110124163130.000|TR0|CNN turned to a number of top experts for 
20110124163130.000|20110124163133.000|TR0|their insight.  Christine Romans of our 
20110124163133.000|20110124163135.000|TR0|Money team joins us now from New York to 
20110124163135.000|20110124163137.000|TR0|talk about what those experts are saying.
20110124163137.000|20110124163140.000|TR0|
20110124163140.000|20110124163142.000|TR0|Hey, Christine.
20110124163142.000|20110124163145.000|TR0|
20110124163145.000|20110124163147.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS 
20110124163147.000|20110124163150.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there.
20110124163150.000|20110124163152.000|TR0|
20110124163152.000|20110124163154.000|TR0|Well, we asked them to rate the state of 
20110124163154.000|20110124163157.000|TR0|housing in this country.  We talked to a 
20110124163157.000|20110124163159.000|TR0|variety of very top experts about where 
20110124163159.000|20110124163202.000|TR0|things stand right now with your most 
20110124163202.000|20110124163204.000|TR0|important asset, probably your biggest 
20110124163204.000|20110124163207.000|TR0|debt, too, your house.
20110124163207.000|20110124163209.000|TR0|
20110124163209.000|20110124163211.000|TR0|We asked them is it weak, improving, 
20110124163211.000|20110124163214.000|TR0|strong, or very strong, where we stand 
20110124163214.000|20110124163216.000|TR0|right now?  And the answer, to a person 
20110124163216.000|20110124163219.000|TR0|with no disagreement, was that the state 
20110124163219.000|20110124163221.000|TR0|of American housing is still weak.
20110124163221.000|20110124163223.000|TR0|
20110124163223.000|20110124163226.000|TR0|Here's what Mark Zandi from Moody's 
20110124163226.000|20110124163228.000|TR0|Analytics explained, why it is so weak.
20110124163228.000|20110124163231.000|TR0|
20110124163231.000|20110124163233.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110124163233.000|20110124163236.000|TR0|
20110124163236.000|20110124163238.000|TR0|MARK ZANDI, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  Housing is 
20110124163238.000|20110124163240.000|TR0|the economy's weakest link. Of course, it 
20110124163240.000|20110124163243.000|TR0|was ground zero for the financial panic in 
20110124163243.000|20110124163245.000|TR0|the Great Recession.  And we still have 
20110124163245.000|20110124163248.000|TR0|more work to do.
20110124163248.000|20110124163250.000|TR0|
20110124163250.000|20110124163253.000|TR0|Home sales and housing construction, they 
20110124163253.000|20110124163255.000|TR0|have stabilized at incredibly low levels.  
20110124163255.000|20110124163257.000|TR0|But unfortunately, I think we've got more 
20110124163257.000|20110124163300.000|TR0|house price declines coming.
20110124163300.000|20110124163302.000|TR0|
20110124163302.000|20110124163305.000|TR0|We have over four million mortgage loans 
20110124163305.000|20110124163307.000|TR0|in the default process.  Many will go 
20110124163307.000|20110124163309.000|TR0|through to a distressed sale, and that 
20110124163309.000|20110124163312.000|TR0|will put downward pressure on housing 
20110124163312.000|20110124163314.000|TR0|values.  So, unfortunately, more house 
20110124163314.000|20110124163317.000|TR0|price declines are coming.  The housing 
20110124163317.000|20110124163319.000|TR0|sector is weak.
20110124163319.000|20110124163322.000|TR0|
20110124163322.000|20110124163324.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110124163324.000|20110124163326.000|TR0|
20110124163326.000|20110124163329.000|TR0|ROMANS:  More house price declines coming. 
20110124163329.000|20110124163331.000|TR0| That's what Mark Zandi just said.  Here's 
20110124163331.000|20110124163334.000|TR0|why.
20110124163334.000|20110124163336.000|TR0|
20110124163336.000|20110124163339.000|TR0|Bank repossessions last year, this is -- 
20110124163339.000|20110124163341.000|TR0|you know, the padlock on the front door, 
20110124163341.000|20110124163343.000|TR0|Carol, averaged 3,287 every single day.  
20110124163343.000|20110124163346.000|TR0|Every day, and we're on track for that 
20110124163346.000|20110124163348.000|TR0|kind of number or higher for this year, 
20110124163348.000|20110124163351.000|TR0|because according to RealtyTrac, you've 
20110124163351.000|20110124163353.000|TR0|got four million to five million overall 
20110124163353.000|20110124163355.000|TR0|foreclosures.  That's every stage of the 
20110124163355.000|20110124163358.000|TR0|process before that padlock on the door.
20110124163358.000|20110124163400.000|TR0|
20110124163400.000|20110124163403.000|TR0|What about home values?  Mark Zandi said 
20110124163403.000|20110124163405.000|TR0|he thinks that they're going to continue 
20110124163405.000|20110124163408.000|TR0|to decline.
20110124163408.000|20110124163410.000|TR0|
20110124163410.000|20110124163412.000|TR0|Well, Mark Zandi, he -- overall, you're 
20110124163412.000|20110124163415.000|TR0|going to see prices maybe move up 0.6 
20110124163415.000|20110124163417.000|TR0|percent.  That's the average from 
20110124163417.000|20110124163420.000|TR0|RealtyTrac, 0.6 percent.  But you have 
20110124163420.000|20110124163422.000|TR0|forecasts all the way from another decline 
20110124163422.000|20110124163425.000|TR0|of 11 percent to a rise of 5 percent for 
20110124163425.000|20110124163427.000|TR0|home prices.  So that's what it looks like 
20110124163427.000|20110124163429.000|TR0|when you "stabilize" at very low levels.
20110124163429.000|20110124163432.000|TR0|
20110124163432.000|20110124163434.000|TR0|So, that's just the hard facts, the state 
20110124163434.000|20110124163437.000|TR0|of the housing market.
20110124163437.000|20110124163439.000|TR0|
20110124163439.000|20110124163441.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  I know.  Whatever way you look 
20110124163441.000|20110124163444.000|TR0|at it, it's ugly.  It's just ugly.
20110124163444.000|20110124163446.000|TR0|
20110124163446.000|20110124163449.000|TR0|ROMANS:  Yes.
20110124163449.000|20110124163451.000|TR0|
20110124163451.000|20110124163454.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Christine, you're going to be 
20110124163454.000|20110124163456.000|TR0|back.
20110124163456.000|20110124163458.000|TR0|
20110124163458.000|20110124163501.000|TR0|And when Christine comes back, she'll take 
20110124163501.000|20110124163503.000|TR0|a look at the state of the job market.  
20110124163503.000|20110124163506.000|TR0|You may be surprised at what the experts 
20110124163506.000|20110124163508.000|TR0|have to say about that.
20110124163508.000|20110124163511.000|TR0|
20110124163511.000|20110124163513.000|TR0|We'll find out just ahead.
20110124163513.000|20110124163515.000|TR0|
20110124163515.000|20110124163518.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK) COSTELLO:  Live 
20110124163518.000|20110124163520.000|TR0|pictures from the White House where 
20110124163520.000|20110124163523.000|TR0|President Obama will be putting the 
20110124163523.000|20110124163525.000|TR0|finishing touches on tomorrow night's 
20110124163525.000|20110124163527.000|TR0|State of the Union address.  Of course, 
20110124163527.000|20110124163530.000|TR0|you can see that live here on CNN with the 
20110124163530.000|20110124163532.000|TR0|Best Political Team on Television.
20110124163532.000|20110124163535.000|TR0|
20110124163535.000|20110124163537.000|TR0|President Obama will give his assessment 
20110124163537.000|20110124163540.000|TR0|on how the country is doing. So what is 
20110124163540.000|20110124163542.000|TR0|the state of the union when it comes to 
20110124163542.000|20110124163544.000|TR0|jobs?  Again, CNN turned to a number of 
20110124163544.000|20110124163547.000|TR0|top experts for their insight.
20110124163547.000|20110124163549.000|TR0|
20110124163549.000|20110124163552.000|TR0|Christine Romans of our Money Team is back 
20110124163552.000|20110124163554.000|TR0|with us from New York to talk about their 
20110124163554.000|20110124163557.000|TR0|conclusions.
20110124163557.000|20110124163559.000|TR0|
20110124163559.000|20110124163601.000|TR0|Christine, take it away.
20110124163601.000|20110124163604.000|TR0|
20110124163604.000|20110124163606.000|TR0|ROMANS:  And again, Carol, we asked them 
20110124163606.000|20110124163609.000|TR0|to rate the state of the job situation in 
20110124163609.000|20110124163611.000|TR0|this country.  We asked them if it's weak, 
20110124163611.000|20110124163614.000|TR0|if it's improving, if it's strong, or very 
20110124163614.000|20110124163616.000|TR0|strong.  And the consensus was that the 
20110124163616.000|20110124163618.000|TR0|jobs market is improving.  After a very 
20110124163618.000|20110124163621.000|TR0|brutal couple of years, they're seeing 
20110124163621.000|20110124163623.000|TR0|some bright spots.
20110124163623.000|20110124163626.000|TR0|
20110124163626.000|20110124163628.000|TR0|Again, Mark Zandi from Moody's Analytics.
20110124163628.000|20110124163630.000|TR0|
20110124163630.000|20110124163633.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110124163633.000|20110124163635.000|TR0|
20110124163635.000|20110124163638.000|TR0|ZANDI:  The job market is improving.  
20110124163638.000|20110124163640.000|TR0|We've created more jobs over the past year 
20110124163640.000|20110124163643.000|TR0|-- 1.35 million private sector jobs over 
20110124163643.000|20110124163645.000|TR0|the past year.  And I think all 
20110124163645.000|20110124163647.000|TR0|preconditions for a better job market are 
20110124163647.000|20110124163650.000|TR0|coming into place.  Businesses are very 
20110124163650.000|20110124163652.000|TR0|profitable, their balance sheets are 
20110124163652.000|20110124163655.000|TR0|strong.  It's increasingly no longer a 
20110124163655.000|20110124163657.000|TR0|question of can they go out and hire more, 
20110124163657.000|20110124163700.000|TR0|it's more of a question of are they 
20110124163700.000|20110124163702.000|TR0|willing.  And I think they will become 
20110124163702.000|20110124163704.000|TR0|more willing in coming months.  (END VIDEO

20110124163709.000|20110124163712.000|TR0|ROMANS:  The big question, of course, is 
20110124163712.000|20110124163714.000|TR0|who will they be hiring as they creep out 
20110124163714.000|20110124163716.000|TR0|there and begin adding to their payrolls?
20110124163716.000|20110124163719.000|TR0|
20110124163719.000|20110124163721.000|TR0|Bill Rogers, a former Labor Department 
20110124163721.000|20110124163724.000|TR0|Economist in the Clinton administration, 
20110124163724.000|20110124163726.000|TR0|now at Rutgers University, he told us the 
20110124163726.000|20110124163729.000|TR0|first beneficiaries of this new 
20110124163729.000|20110124163731.000|TR0|accelerated hiring will be people with the 
20110124163731.000|20110124163733.000|TR0|right match of education, experience, and 
20110124163733.000|20110124163736.000|TR0|skills.  He said we're going to be very 
20110124163736.000|20110124163738.000|TR0|far from being able to provide enough jobs 
20110124163738.000|20110124163741.000|TR0|to absorb all those people who lost their 
20110124163741.000|20110124163743.000|TR0|jobs in the recession.
20110124163743.000|20110124163746.000|TR0|
20110124163746.000|20110124163748.000|TR0|Just today, along the lines of the better 
20110124163748.000|20110124163750.000|TR0|news about the job situation, the National 
20110124163750.000|20110124163753.000|TR0|Association for Business Economics, a 
20110124163753.000|20110124163755.000|TR0|trade group, those economists forecast 
20110124163755.000|20110124163758.000|TR0|that 42 percent of their members surveyed 
20110124163758.000|20110124163800.000|TR0|said they will be hiring within the next 
20110124163800.000|20110124163802.000|TR0|six months.  Forty- two percent said they 
20110124163802.000|20110124163805.000|TR0|will be hiring.  That compares with 29 
20110124163805.000|20110124163807.000|TR0|percent a year ago.  So, Carol, you can 
20110124163807.000|20110124163810.000|TR0|see the improvement there.
20110124163810.000|20110124163812.000|TR0|
20110124163812.000|20110124163815.000|TR0|And when you look at the number of people, 
20110124163815.000|20110124163817.000|TR0|number of those folks who said they would 
20110124163817.000|20110124163819.000|TR0|be firing, that was just seven percent.  
20110124163819.000|20110124163822.000|TR0|So it's the best spread between hiring and 
20110124163822.000|20110124163824.000|TR0|firing.  The employment outlook, at a 
20110124163824.000|20110124163827.000|TR0|12-year high.
20110124163827.000|20110124163829.000|TR0|
20110124163829.000|20110124163832.000|TR0|So, there you go.  We're going to have a 
20110124163832.000|20110124163834.000|TR0|lot of work to do to dig out of the hole, 
20110124163834.000|20110124163836.000|TR0|Carol.  There is no question about that.  
20110124163836.000|20110124163839.000|TR0|People who've been out of work 99 weeks, 
20110124163839.000|20110124163841.000|TR0|the 99ers, they're still going to have a 
20110124163841.000|20110124163844.000|TR0|difficult time finding their way.  But the 
20110124163844.000|20110124163846.000|TR0|job outlook, according to the experts that 
20110124163846.000|20110124163848.000|TR0|we surveyed, they pretty much agree that 
20110124163848.000|20110124163851.000|TR0|it is improving -- Carol.
20110124163851.000|20110124163853.000|TR0|
20110124163853.000|20110124163856.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Well, that's a bit of bright 
20110124163856.000|20110124163858.000|TR0|news and we like that.
20110124163858.000|20110124163901.000|TR0|

20110124163951.000|20110124163954.000|TR0|memories until later in life, in fact.  
20110124163954.000|20110124163956.000|TR0|Until at least, like, four, five, six.  I 
20110124163956.000|20110124163959.000|TR0|don't remember anything from my early 
20110124163959.000|20110124164001.000|TR0|childhood.

20110124164033.000|20110124164035.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  They certainly did, Carol. 
20110124164035.000|20110124164037.000|TR0| Yes, "Becoming Chaz" is the documentary 
20110124164037.000|20110124164040.000|TR0|that Oprah Winfrey could not wait to get 
20110124164040.000|20110124164042.000|TR0|her hands on.  She bought it before the 
20110124164042.000|20110124164045.000|TR0|festival even started.  And I'm joined now 
20110124164045.000|20110124164047.000|TR0|by the men behind the documentary, Randy 
20110124164047.000|20110124164050.000|TR0|Barbato and Fenton Bailey.
20110124164050.000|20110124164052.000|TR0|
20110124164052.000|20110124164054.000|TR0|Congratulations on the premiere.  I was 
20110124164054.000|20110124164057.000|TR0|there.  Standing ovation, rousing 
20110124164057.000|20110124164059.000|TR0|applause.  It was a huge success.
20110124164059.000|20110124164102.000|TR0|
20110124164102.000|20110124164104.000|TR0|FENTON BAILEY, CO-DIRECTOR, "BECOMING 
20110124164104.000|20110124164106.000|TR0|CHAZ":  Yes, it was very exciting.  We 
20110124164106.000|20110124164109.000|TR0|spent about two years making this film and 
20110124164109.000|20110124164111.000|TR0|last night was sort of the icing on the 
20110124164111.000|20110124164114.000|TR0|cake.  It was really exciting.
20110124164114.000|20110124164116.000|TR0|
20110124164116.000|20110124164119.000|TR0|ANDERSON:  Well, the movie chronicles Chaz 
20110124164119.000|20110124164121.000|TR0|Bono's transformation from female to male. 
20110124164121.000|20110124164123.000|TR0| What surprised you the most about Chaz 
20110124164123.000|20110124164126.000|TR0|and about the process that you learned 
20110124164126.000|20110124164128.000|TR0|during filming?
20110124164128.000|20110124164131.000|TR0|
20110124164131.000|20110124164133.000|TR0|RANDY BARBATO, CO-DIRECTOR, "BECOMING 
20110124164133.000|20110124164136.000|TR0|CHAZ":  The physical changes are evident.  
20110124164136.000|20110124164138.000|TR0|The profound psychological shift as he 
20110124164138.000|20110124164140.000|TR0|really becomes a man. I think that 
20110124164140.000|20110124164143.000|TR0|surprised us.  I think that surprised his 
20110124164143.000|20110124164145.000|TR0|partner Jennifer.  And actually, I think 
20110124164145.000|20110124164148.000|TR0|it surprised Chaz himself, too.  ANDERSON: 
20110124164148.000|20110124164150.000|TR0| I asked Chaz after the screening, during 
20110124164150.000|20110124164152.000|TR0|the brief Q , you know, if it was 
20110124164152.000|20110124164155.000|TR0|difficult to relive any of the moments, 
20110124164155.000|20110124164157.000|TR0|the tough times when he watched it on 
20110124164157.000|20110124164200.000|TR0|film.  And he said, yes, there are some 
20110124164200.000|20110124164202.000|TR0|ups and downs.  But it's not hard to watch 
20110124164202.000|20110124164205.000|TR0|it.  He's happy now.  He just wants to 
20110124164205.000|20110124164207.000|TR0|help other people who might be struggling 
20110124164207.000|20110124164209.000|TR0|with gender identity issues, as well.
20110124164209.000|20110124164212.000|TR0|
20110124164212.000|20110124164214.000|TR0|What message do you hope this movie sends?
20110124164214.000|20110124164217.000|TR0|
20110124164217.000|20110124164219.000|TR0|BAILEY:  One of the messages I hope it 
20110124164219.000|20110124164222.000|TR0|sends we actually have more in common with 
20110124164222.000|20110124164224.000|TR0|someone like Chaz Bono than we think.  
20110124164224.000|20110124164226.000|TR0|Like, we imagine someone transitioning 
20110124164226.000|20110124164229.000|TR0|from one gender to another is so different 
20110124164229.000|20110124164231.000|TR0|than we are.  But, in fact, Chaz is just a 
20110124164231.000|20110124164234.000|TR0|regular Joe.  And we have a lot more in 
20110124164234.000|20110124164236.000|TR0|common than I think we realize.
20110124164236.000|20110124164238.000|TR0|
20110124164238.000|20110124164241.000|TR0|ANDERSON:  He has a great sense of humor.  
20110124164241.000|20110124164243.000|TR0|So the heavy moments were, you know, 
20110124164243.000|20110124164246.000|TR0|uplifted with light hearted moments, as 
20110124164246.000|20110124164248.000|TR0|well.  So you guys did a great job with 
20110124164248.000|20110124164251.000|TR0|that as well.  But there were times that 
20110124164251.000|20110124164253.000|TR0|were difficult to watch.  For me, his 
20110124164253.000|20110124164255.000|TR0|mother Cher obviously had a tough time 
20110124164255.000|20110124164258.000|TR0|accepting it.
20110124164258.000|20110124164300.000|TR0|
20110124164300.000|20110124164303.000|TR0|Have you spoken with her since the movie?  
20110124164303.000|20110124164305.000|TR0|Has she seen the movie and her part in it?
20110124164305.000|20110124164308.000|TR0|
20110124164308.000|20110124164310.000|TR0|BARBATO:  We don't know if she's seen it.  
20110124164310.000|20110124164312.000|TR0|When you transition, it's the beginning of 
20110124164312.000|20110124164315.000|TR0|a process, not the end of a process.  It's 
20110124164315.000|20110124164317.000|TR0|like life, it's something to be managed.  
20110124164317.000|20110124164320.000|TR0|And you can see the relationship shift 
20110124164320.000|20110124164322.000|TR0|from a mother/daughter relationship to a 
20110124164322.000|20110124164324.000|TR0|mother/son relationship.  And I think 
20110124164324.000|20110124164327.000|TR0|there's a long way to go.  But we've all 
20110124164327.000|20110124164329.000|TR0|got a long way to go, right?
20110124164329.000|20110124164332.000|TR0|
20110124164332.000|20110124164334.000|TR0|ANDERSON:  And when does the movie -- very 
20110124164334.000|20110124164337.000|TR0|quickly -- it will air on the OWN network 
20110124164337.000|20110124164339.000|TR0|in the spring?
20110124164339.000|20110124164341.000|TR0|
20110124164341.000|20110124164344.000|TR0|BAILEY:  In the spring.  I think maybe 
20110124164344.000|20110124164346.000|TR0|even May 1st is what I heard.
20110124164346.000|20110124164349.000|TR0|
20110124164349.000|20110124164351.000|TR0|ANDERSON:  Looking forward to that.  
20110124164351.000|20110124164354.000|TR0|Congratulations.

20110124164410.000|20110124164413.000|TR0|We've been telling you about breaking news 
20110124164413.000|20110124164415.000|TR0|out of Moscow for the past couple of hours 
20110124164415.000|20110124164418.000|TR0|now.  We have an update on how many were 
20110124164418.000|20110124164420.000|TR0|killed.  We still believe that 31 people 
20110124164420.000|20110124164423.000|TR0|were killed.  And officials in Moscow are 
20110124164423.000|20110124164425.000|TR0|now downgrading the number of people 
20110124164425.000|20110124164427.000|TR0|injured to 54 or so.  We're going to have 
20110124164427.000|20110124164430.000|TR0|much more information out of Moscow and 
20110124164430.000|20110124164432.000|TR0|that suicide bombing in the busiest

20110124164437.000|20110124164440.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK) COSTELLO:  Telling you 
20110124164440.000|20110124164442.000|TR0|about that breaking news out of most 
20110124164442.000|20110124164444.000|TR0|Moscow.  A suicide bomber set off an 
20110124164444.000|20110124164447.000|TR0|explosion in the busiest airport in the 
20110124164447.000|20110124164449.000|TR0|city of Moscow.  Thirty-one people are 
20110124164449.000|20110124164452.000|TR0|believed to have been killed and some 54 
20110124164452.000|20110124164454.000|TR0|seriously injured and another 94 or so 
20110124164454.000|20110124164456.000|TR0|suffered slight injuries.  Amazingly 
20110124164456.000|20110124164459.000|TR0|enough, according to Russian authorities, 
20110124164459.000|20110124164501.000|TR0|the airport is up and running.  They say 
20110124164501.000|20110124164504.000|TR0|there have been no delays, which is kind 
20110124164504.000|20110124164506.000|TR0|of hard to believe with so many killed in 
20110124164506.000|20110124164509.000|TR0|that baggage area.

20110124164518.000|20110124164521.000|TR0|I'd like you to put this in perspective 
20110124164521.000|20110124164523.000|TR0|and tell us what this explosion in this 
20110124164523.000|20110124164526.000|TR0|airport might mean the United States?
20110124164526.000|20110124164528.000|TR0|
20110124164528.000|20110124164530.000|TR0|FRAN TOWNSEND, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  The 
20110124164530.000|20110124164533.000|TR0|Russian government struggle against 
20110124164533.000|20110124164535.000|TR0|Chechens and extremists who are also sort 
20110124164535.000|20110124164538.000|TR0|of Sunni extremist, al Qaeda-like group is 
20110124164538.000|20110124164540.000|TR0|years in its history.
20110124164540.000|20110124164542.000|TR0|
20110124164542.000|20110124164545.000|TR0|In 2004, two Chechen women blew themselves 
20110124164545.000|20110124164547.000|TR0|up on planes, bringing planes down and 
20110124164547.000|20110124164550.000|TR0|killing everybody on board with explosive 
20110124164550.000|20110124164552.000|TR0|vests.  This is a change of tactics that, 
20110124164552.000|20110124164555.000|TR0|as you mention, has real implications for 
20110124164555.000|20110124164557.000|TR0|TSA here in the United States.
20110124164557.000|20110124164559.000|TR0|
20110124164559.000|20110124164602.000|TR0|Our understanding right now is that the 
20110124164602.000|20110124164604.000|TR0|suicide bomber comes into the arrivals 
20110124164604.000|20110124164607.000|TR0|area where you pick up your bags.  The 
20110124164607.000|20110124164609.000|TR0|problem with that for U.S. officials is 
20110124164609.000|20110124164612.000|TR0|there is no screening.  Anyone can come 
20110124164612.000|20110124164614.000|TR0|into the arrivals area to meet guests, to 
20110124164614.000|20110124164616.000|TR0|pick up their bags.  Once you're in the 
20110124164616.000|20110124164619.000|TR0|arrivals area, oftentimes you can go 
20110124164619.000|20110124164621.000|TR0|upstairs or further into the airport where 
20110124164621.000|20110124164624.000|TR0|there is food courts and shops and get 
20110124164624.000|20110124164626.000|TR0|closer.  You can't get into the gate area 
20110124164626.000|20110124164628.000|TR0|without going through security.  But you 
20110124164628.000|20110124164631.000|TR0|can get pretty far into the airport.
20110124164631.000|20110124164633.000|TR0|
20110124164633.000|20110124164636.000|TR0|And so, already here in New York, you're 
20110124164636.000|20110124164638.000|TR0|seeing in office buildings the security 
20110124164638.000|20110124164641.000|TR0|folks are approaching you before you get 
20110124164641.000|20110124164643.000|TR0|inside the lobby of the building.  And I 
20110124164643.000|20110124164645.000|TR0|think you're going to see a change in 
20110124164645.000|20110124164648.000|TR0|protocols around U.S. airports, around 
20110124164648.000|20110124164650.000|TR0|arrival areas.
20110124164650.000|20110124164653.000|TR0|
20110124164653.000|20110124164655.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  So what might that mean?  Will 
20110124164655.000|20110124164658.000|TR0|everyone -- will people not be allowed in 
20110124164658.000|20110124164700.000|TR0|the airport to meet their loved ones who 
20110124164700.000|20110124164702.000|TR0|are picking up bags?  Will we have to park 
20110124164702.000|20110124164705.000|TR0|even farther from airport curbside than we 
20110124164705.000|20110124164707.000|TR0|already do?
20110124164707.000|20110124164710.000|TR0|
20110124164710.000|20110124164712.000|TR0|TOWNSEND:  I don't expect you'll see 
20110124164712.000|20110124164714.000|TR0|people having to park further away.  
20110124164714.000|20110124164717.000|TR0|Although that has often been a concern for 
20110124164717.000|20110124164719.000|TR0|security officials. The question will be, 
20110124164719.000|20110124164722.000|TR0|will there be more of a police presence?  
20110124164722.000|20110124164724.000|TR0|Will you see more bomb-sniffing dogs as 
20110124164724.000|20110124164727.000|TR0|you enter through an arrival area? It'll 
20110124164727.000|20110124164729.000|TR0|be very difficult to screen everyone 
20110124164729.000|20110124164731.000|TR0|coming into that area.
20110124164731.000|20110124164734.000|TR0|
20110124164734.000|20110124164736.000|TR0|And frankly what we've seen over the years 
20110124164736.000|20110124164739.000|TR0|since 9/11 are al Qaeda and Sunni 
20110124164739.000|20110124164741.000|TR0|extremists will adapt their tactics around 
20110124164741.000|20110124164744.000|TR0|the screening procedures that they can 
20110124164744.000|20110124164746.000|TR0|observe at airports, at train stations.  
20110124164746.000|20110124164748.000|TR0|And so this is just one more adaptation.  
20110124164748.000|20110124164751.000|TR0|Security officials are going to have to 
20110124164751.000|20110124164753.000|TR0|see how can they adapt to, to try and 
20110124164753.000|20110124164756.000|TR0|protect the traveling public.
20110124164756.000|20110124164758.000|TR0|

20110124164808.000|20110124164810.000|TR0|a suicide bomber set off an explosion in a 
20110124164810.000|20110124164813.000|TR0|Moscow airport, its busiest passenger 
20110124164813.000|20110124164815.000|TR0|airport, killed 31 people, injured about 
20110124164815.000|20110124164817.000|TR0|100 more.  You're looking at pictures 
20110124164817.000|20110124164820.000|TR0|we're just getting in to CNN.  The suicide 
20110124164820.000|20110124164822.000|TR0|bomber set off that explosion right 
20110124164822.000|20110124164825.000|TR0|outside of a little restaurant in the 
20110124164825.000|20110124164827.000|TR0|airport, near the baggage claim area, 
20110124164827.000|20110124164830.000|TR0|which is causing all of this concern all

20110124164854.000|20110124164856.000|TR0|we've been following this morning out of 
20110124164856.000|20110124164859.000|TR0|St. Petersburg, Florida.  Two police 
20110124164859.000|20110124164901.000|TR0|officers have died.  A gunman shot and 
20110124164901.000|20110124164903.000|TR0|killed the two officers and wounded a 
20110124164903.000|20110124164906.000|TR0|federal marshal who were trying to serve 
20110124164906.000|20110124164908.000|TR0|an arrest warrant at a home.  This makes 
20110124164908.000|20110124164911.000|TR0|at least 10 officers shot around the 
20110124164911.000|20110124164913.000|TR0|country in the past 24 hours.  The others 
20110124164913.000|20110124164916.000|TR0|were in Detroit, Indianapolis, and

20110124164942.000|20110124164945.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Carol.  That's what a 
20110124164945.000|20110124164947.000|TR0|lot of people are wondering.  Twelve 
20110124164947.000|20110124164949.000|TR0|percent is a big jump and economists say 
20110124164949.000|20110124164952.000|TR0|that put sales at the highest level since 
20110124164952.000|20110124164954.000|TR0|June when the home buyer tax credit 
20110124164954.000|20110124164957.000|TR0|expired.  With the median price of homes 
20110124164957.000|20110124164959.000|TR0|sold at $168,000, you might be thinking 
20110124164959.000|20110124165002.000|TR0|about moving from the renters market and 
20110124165002.000|20110124165004.000|TR0|becoming a buyer.

20110124165006.000|20110124165009.000|TR0|But there are a few things to consider.

20110124165014.000|20110124165016.000|TR0|you need to consider these five questions 
20110124165016.000|20110124165019.000|TR0|before you even start on the path to 
20110124165019.000|20110124165021.000|TR0|homeownership.  One, do you plan to stay 
20110124165021.000|20110124165023.000|TR0|in your house for more than five years?  
20110124165023.000|20110124165026.000|TR0|Do you have job security?  Do you have six 
20110124165026.000|20110124165028.000|TR0|to eight months o of living expenses saved 
20110124165028.000|20110124165031.000|TR0|outside of your down payment?  And, do you 
20110124165031.000|20110124165033.000|TR0|have 10 percent to put down?  Is 
20110124165033.000|20110124165035.000|TR0|homeownership also, is it important to you 
20110124165035.000|20110124165038.000|TR0|personally and financially.
20110124165038.000|20110124165040.000|TR0|
20110124165040.000|20110124165043.000|TR0|If you answered yes to these following 
20110124165043.000|20110124165045.000|TR0|questions homeownership might make sense 
20110124165045.000|20110124165048.000|TR0|for you.  But don't feel you need to make 
20110124165048.000|20110124165050.000|TR0|any sort of rushed decision right now.  
20110124165050.000|20110124165052.000|TR0|Historically the housing market hasn't 
20110124165052.000|20110124165055.000|TR0|bounced back overnight ever.  That's never 
20110124165055.000|20110124165057.000|TR0|happened.  So you actually do have some 
20110124165057.000|20110124165100.000|TR0|time, Carol.
20110124165100.000|20110124165102.000|TR0|
20110124165102.000|20110124165105.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  But it's taking such a long 
20110124165105.000|20110124165107.000|TR0|time this time around.
20110124165107.000|20110124165109.000|TR0|
20110124165109.000|20110124165112.000|TR0|But if you really have your mind set on 
20110124165112.000|20110124165114.000|TR0|buying a home, though, Stephanie, what can 
20110124165114.000|20110124165117.000|TR0|you do to lessen the cost, to make it 
20110124165117.000|20110124165119.000|TR0|possible?
20110124165119.000|20110124165121.000|TR0|
20110124165121.000|20110124165124.000|TR0|ELAM:  Right.  And Everyone would love to 
20110124165124.000|20110124165126.000|TR0|have that slice of the American Dream.  
20110124165126.000|20110124165129.000|TR0|But you've got to make sure you've got all 
20110124165129.000|20110124165131.000|TR0|of your financial documents in order.  
20110124165131.000|20110124165134.000|TR0|Take a look at your credit score.  John 
20110124165134.000|20110124165136.000|TR0|Ulzheimer, he's from SmartCredit.com says 
20110124165136.000|20110124165138.000|TR0|an elite score is around 750.  The higher 
20110124165138.000|20110124165141.000|TR0|your score, the lower your interest rate 
20110124165141.000|20110124165143.000|TR0|you'll be able to earn from the mortgage 
20110124165143.000|20110124165146.000|TR0|company.
20110124165146.000|20110124165148.000|TR0|
20110124165148.000|20110124165151.000|TR0|Also, Carmen has other simple advice.  Buy 
20110124165151.000|20110124165153.000|TR0|less house than you think you can afford.  
20110124165153.000|20110124165155.000|TR0|You want to be able to pay the mortgage if 
20110124165155.000|20110124165158.000|TR0|you want to pay the mortgage if you 
20110124165158.000|20110124165200.000|TR0|suddenly lose your job or if you lose a 
20110124165200.000|20110124165203.000|TR0|job or have unforeseen medical expenses.  
20110124165203.000|20110124165205.000|TR0|And those things that you don't know, 
20110124165205.000|20110124165207.000|TR0|usually those are the most painful ones, 
20110124165207.000|20110124165210.000|TR0|Carol.
20110124165210.000|20110124165212.000|TR0|
20110124165212.000|20110124165215.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Yes.  Those are the killers.
20110124165215.000|20110124165217.000|TR0|
20110124165217.000|20110124165220.000|TR0|ELAM:  Yes.
20110124165220.000|20110124165222.000|TR0|
20110124165222.000|20110124165224.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  So how do you figure out the 
20110124165224.000|20110124165227.000|TR0|real cost of renting versus buying?  I 
20110124165227.000|20110124165229.000|TR0|know, Stephanie, you're going to come back 
20110124165229.000|20110124165232.000|TR0|and answer that for us in a couple of 
20110124165232.000|20110124165234.000|TR0|moments.

20110124165241.000|20110124165244.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  We're back with Stephanie Elam 
20110124165244.000|20110124165246.000|TR0|on renting versus buying.
20110124165246.000|20110124165249.000|TR0|
20110124165249.000|20110124165251.000|TR0|And Steph, you have a quick way to figure 
20110124165251.000|20110124165253.000|TR0|out how to compare the costs.  So, let's 
20110124165253.000|20110124165256.000|TR0|talk about the costs.
20110124165256.000|20110124165258.000|TR0|
20110124165258.000|20110124165301.000|TR0|ELAM:  Yes.  Yes.  We spoke to Carmen Wong 
20110124165301.000|20110124165303.000|TR0|Ulrich.  She told us about this rule of 15 
20110124165303.000|20110124165306.000|TR0|she has to figure out the costs associated 
20110124165306.000|20110124165308.000|TR0|with renting versus buying.
20110124165308.000|20110124165310.000|TR0|
20110124165310.000|20110124165313.000|TR0|So, take a look at this.  Multiply your 
20110124165313.000|20110124165315.000|TR0|annual rent by 15, then you want to 
20110124165315.000|20110124165318.000|TR0|compare that to the going asking price for 
20110124165318.000|20110124165320.000|TR0|a home in your area.  If the sales price 
20110124165320.000|20110124165323.000|TR0|is much higher than your annual rent times 
20110124165323.000|20110124165325.000|TR0|15, then renting may be the best option.  
20110124165325.000|20110124165327.000|TR0|But if your rent is higher than the sales 
20110124165327.000|20110124165330.000|TR0|price, then it might be a buyer's market 
20110124165330.000|20110124165332.000|TR0|for you.
20110124165332.000|20110124165335.000|TR0|
20110124165335.000|20110124165337.000|TR0|And one last thing Carmen also said to us. 
20110124165337.000|20110124165339.000|TR0| You got to remember the other real 
20110124165339.000|20110124165342.000|TR0|expenses.  For owning, there's utilities, 
20110124165342.000|20110124165344.000|TR0|there's maintenance, there's property 
20110124165344.000|20110124165347.000|TR0|taxes, there's extra community costs 
20110124165347.000|20110124165349.000|TR0|probably.  With renting, you don't want to 
20110124165349.000|20110124165352.000|TR0|forget with real estate agent's finder's 
20110124165352.000|20110124165354.000|TR0|fees, security deposits, and renter's 
20110124165354.000|20110124165356.000|TR0|insurance.
20110124165356.000|20110124165359.000|TR0|
20110124165359.000|20110124165401.000|TR0|All of those little things in both columns 
20110124165401.000|20110124165404.000|TR0|can really add up.  And there's one added 
20110124165404.000|20110124165406.000|TR0|bonus though, if you are renting.  If 
20110124165406.000|20110124165409.000|TR0|something breaks, you can always just call 
20110124165409.000|20110124165411.000|TR0|the owner and say, hey, come fix it.
20110124165411.000|20110124165413.000|TR0|
20110124165413.000|20110124165416.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Oh, that's true.  That's so 
20110124165416.000|20110124165418.000|TR0|nice, isn't it?  I miss those days.
20110124165418.000|20110124165421.000|TR0|
20110124165421.000|20110124165423.000|TR0|ELAM:   Yes.  I know, those were good days.

20110124165425.000|20110124165428.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Stephanie Elam, thanks very

20110124165514.000|20110124165516.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  The fuss is about just as 
20110124165516.000|20110124165519.000|TR0|you said, George Allen, the Republican, 
20110124165519.000|20110124165521.000|TR0|former Republican senator, former 
20110124165521.000|20110124165524.000|TR0|Republican governor, also from Virginia.  
20110124165524.000|20110124165526.000|TR0|He does want his old job back.
20110124165526.000|20110124165528.000|TR0|
20110124165528.000|20110124165531.000|TR0|You remember, Carol, back in 2006, this 
20110124165531.000|20110124165533.000|TR0|was one of the closest races. It was one 
20110124165533.000|20110124165536.000|TR0|of those not called until well after 
20110124165536.000|20110124165538.000|TR0|Election Day.  And now he is going to say 
20110124165538.000|20110124165541.000|TR0|today, look, I want to come back to

20110124165550.000|20110124165553.000|TR0|talking about, you remember that so-called

20110124165607.000|20110124165610.000|TR0|of those first moments that was caught by 
20110124165610.000|20110124165612.000|TR0|one of those trackers where he made a 
20110124165612.000|20110124165614.000|TR0|comment that was seen as potentially 
20110124165614.000|20110124165617.000|TR0|racist.  He, of course, denied that and 
20110124165617.000|20110124165619.000|TR0|said that's not what he meant.  But

20110124165629.000|20110124165631.000|TR0|his worries.  That since he was defeated 
20110124165631.000|20110124165634.000|TR0|here, that he has been somebody who is a 
20110124165634.000|20110124165636.000|TR0|Republican established candidate who has 
20110124165636.000|20110124165639.000|TR0|been involved incorporate interest.  And 
20110124165639.000|20110124165641.000|TR0|that, actually, to be honest with you, 
20110124165641.000|20110124165643.000|TR0|might be one of his biggest issues there.  
20110124165643.000|20110124165646.000|TR0|There is already a Tea Party candidate in 
20110124165646.000|20110124165648.000|TR0|that race for the Republican nomination in 
20110124165648.000|20110124165651.000|TR0|Virginia, Carol.  So, that may be a big 
20110124165651.000|20110124165653.000|TR0|problem for him in this climate when it 
20110124165653.000|20110124165656.000|TR0|comes to Republicans.
20110124165656.000|20110124165658.000|TR0|
20110124165658.000|20110124165700.000|TR0|And second item on the ticker, Carol, is 
20110124165700.000|20110124165703.000|TR0|all of the buzz here on Capitol Hill.  Of 
20110124165703.000|20110124165705.000|TR0|course, we are just over 24 hours away 
20110124165705.000|20110124165708.000|TR0|from President Obama's State of the Union 
20110124165708.000|20110124165710.000|TR0|address here.  And the issue is spending, 
20110124165710.000|20110124165713.000|TR0|spending, and spending.
20110124165713.000|20110124165715.000|TR0|
20110124165715.000|20110124165717.000|TR0|Republicans were all over the Sunday's 
20110124165717.000|20110124165720.000|TR0|talk shows yesterday.  We're also hearing 
20110124165720.000|20110124165722.000|TR0|from them today, talking about the fact 
20110124165722.000|20110124165725.000|TR0|that they really mean it when they say 
20110124165725.000|20110124165727.000|TR0|they are going to make sure that spending 
20110124165727.000|20110124165729.000|TR0|is slashed.
20110124165729.000|20110124165732.000|TR0|
20110124165732.000|20110124165734.000|TR0|You remember, in the pledge that House 
20110124165734.000|20110124165737.000|TR0|Republicans made?  They said they were 
20110124165737.000|20110124165739.000|TR0|going to cut back to 2008 spending levels. 
20110124165739.000|20110124165742.000|TR0| Well, there are a lot of Republicans in 
20110124165742.000|20110124165744.000|TR0|the House who say, that's not enough.  We 
20110124165744.000|20110124165746.000|TR0|want to cut even more.  We want to cut 
20110124165746.000|20110124165749.000|TR0|trillions of dollars and that will mean 
20110124165749.000|20110124165751.000|TR0|some really tough cuts for programs that 
20110124165751.000|20110124165754.000|TR0|are popular.  And the President and 
20110124165754.000|20110124165756.000|TR0|Democrats are saying, OK, we understand we 
20110124165756.000|20110124165759.000|TR0|need to cut some spending but they also 
20110124165759.000|20110124165801.000|TR0|want to increase in areas like 
20110124165801.000|20110124165803.000|TR0|infrastructure and clean coal technology, 
20110124165803.000|20110124165806.000|TR0|clean energy.  So this fight is just 
20110124165806.000|20110124165808.000|TR0|beginning.  It's going to dominate, 
20110124165808.000|20110124165811.000|TR0|dominate over the next several months.
20110124165811.000|20110124165813.000|TR0|
20110124165813.000|20110124165815.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  Absolutely.  But of course 
20110124165815.000|20110124165818.000|TR0|they're going to try to do that in a 
20110124165818.000|20110124165820.000|TR0|bipartisan spirit and to set that up, 
20110124165820.000|20110124165823.000|TR0|they're going to sit together, Democrat 
20110124165823.000|20110124165825.000|TR0|and Republican at the State of the Union.
20110124165825.000|20110124165828.000|TR0|
20110124165828.000|20110124165830.000|TR0|And already jokes -- for Senator Kristen 
20110124165830.000|20110124165832.000|TR0|Gillibrand and Senator John Thune sitting 
20110124165832.000|20110124165835.000|TR0|together, I think USA called them the prom 
20110124165835.000|20110124165837.000|TR0|king and queen?
20110124165837.000|20110124165840.000|TR0|
20110124165840.000|20110124165842.000|TR0|BASH:  Well, you know, I know we don't 
20110124165842.000|20110124165845.000|TR0|have a lot of time left but let me just 
20110124165845.000|20110124165847.000|TR0|tell you that from last week or even 
20110124165847.000|20110124165849.000|TR0|before that when this started becoming a 
20110124165849.000|20110124165852.000|TR0|thing here, that was absolutely what it 
20110124165852.000|20110124165854.000|TR0|was.  Our congressional producer Ted 
20110124165854.000|20110124165857.000|TR0|Barrett (ph) said from the beginning, this 
20110124165857.000|20110124165859.000|TR0|is turning out to be like the prom.  
20110124165859.000|20110124165901.000|TR0|Everybody is racing for a date.
20110124165901.000|20110124165904.000|TR0|
20110124165904.000|20110124165906.000|TR0|And I've talked to so many members of 
20110124165906.000|20110124165909.000|TR0|Congress who have told me, you know, the 
20110124165909.000|20110124165911.000|TR0|stories about them calling their 
20110124165911.000|20110124165914.000|TR0|Republican or Democratic counterpart and 
20110124165914.000|20110124165916.000|TR0|saying, would you go with me?  Would you 
20110124165916.000|20110124165918.000|TR0|go with me? One ever joked about whether 
20110124165918.000|20110124165921.000|TR0|or not she was going to get a corsage. So, 
20110124165921.000|20110124165923.000|TR0|we'll see.
20110124165923.000|20110124165926.000|TR0|
20110124165926.000|20110124165928.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110124165928.000|20110124165931.000|TR0|
20110124165931.000|20110124165933.000|TR0|COSTELLO:  It will be interesting.  Dana 
20110124165933.000|20110124165935.000|TR0|Bash, many thanks to you.
