20110124150007.000|20110124150009.000|TR0|RANDI KAYE, CNN ANCHOR:  Our main focus 
20110124150009.000|20110124150012.000|TR0|this hour though, that breaking news out 
20110124150012.000|20110124150014.000|TR0|of Moscow; an explosion has ripped through 
20110124150014.000|20110124150017.000|TR0|the city's international airport.  The 
20110124150017.000|20110124150020.000|TR0|government says at least 31 people are 
20110124150020.000|20110124150022.000|TR0|dead, 130 wounded.
20110124150022.000|20110124150025.000|TR0|
20110124150025.000|20110124150027.000|TR0|Alexei Eremenko with the "Moscow Times" 
20110124150027.000|20110124150030.000|TR0|joins me now by phone. Alexei what can you 
20110124150030.000|20110124150033.000|TR0|tell us from there?
20110124150033.000|20110124150035.000|TR0|
20110124150035.000|20110124150038.000|TR0|ALEXEI EREMENKO, "MOSCOW TIMES" (via 
20110124150038.000|20110124150040.000|TR0|telephone):  Hi there. Apparently not 
20110124150040.000|20110124150043.000|TR0|much; nobody seems to figure out what's 
20110124150043.000|20110124150046.000|TR0|happening. It's really (INAUDIBLE).  We 
20110124150046.000|20110124150048.000|TR0|have got a current body count for now; 
20110124150048.000|20110124150051.000|TR0|it's probably going to grow some more 
20110124150051.000|20110124150054.000|TR0|because the rescue operation is still in 
20110124150054.000|20110124150056.000|TR0|progress.
20110124150056.000|20110124150059.000|TR0|
20110124150059.000|20110124150101.000|TR0|Apparently it was a blast at the 
20110124150101.000|20110124150104.000|TR0|international arrival hall. But so far 
20110124150104.000|20110124150107.000|TR0|nobody's been able to figure out, like, 
20110124150107.000|20110124150109.000|TR0|what - what plane the alleged suicide 
20110124150109.000|20110124150112.000|TR0|bomber.  And whether there's maybe more of 
20110124150112.000|20110124150114.000|TR0|them.  So the police don't rule this one 
20110124150114.000|20110124150117.000|TR0|out either.
20110124150117.000|20110124150120.000|TR0|
20110124150120.000|20110124150122.000|TR0|KAYE:  This happened just about an hour 
20110124150122.000|20110124150125.000|TR0|and a half ago or so. Can you tell us what 
20110124150125.000|20110124150128.000|TR0|the situation is at the airport at this 
20110124150128.000|20110124150130.000|TR0|hour?
20110124150130.000|20110124150133.000|TR0|
20110124150133.000|20110124150135.000|TR0|EREMENKO:  Well, some planes have been 
20110124150135.000|20110124150138.000|TR0|delayed.  But the incoming ones have been  
20110124150138.000|20110124150141.000|TR0|diverted to the other airports around 
20110124150141.000|20110124150143.000|TR0|Moscow.  There's thankfully two more  
20110124150143.000|20110124150146.000|TR0|capable of accommodating them.  We frankly 
20110124150146.000|20110124150148.000|TR0|don't know what's happening with - within 
20110124150148.000|20110124150151.000|TR0|the airport.  Our reporter has been 
20110124150151.000|20110124150154.000|TR0|dispatched there.
20110124150154.000|20110124150156.000|TR0|
20110124150156.000|20110124150159.000|TR0|KAYE:   And if you can, just set the scene 
20110124150159.000|20110124150202.000|TR0|for us.  How busy would it - might it have 
20110124150202.000|20110124150204.000|TR0|been in the baggage claim area about this 
20110124150204.000|20110124150207.000|TR0|time?  The blast took place at about 4:40 
20110124150207.000|20110124150209.000|TR0|p.m. Moscow time.
20110124150209.000|20110124150212.000|TR0|
20110124150212.000|20110124150215.000|TR0|EREMENKO:  Yes, there's been, like, so far 
20110124150215.000|20110124150217.000|TR0|we know there's been like four flights, 
20110124150217.000|20110124150220.000|TR0|incoming.  And apparently people from all 
20110124150220.000|20110124150222.000|TR0|of them have been claiming their baggage.  
20110124150222.000|20110124150225.000|TR0|So it must have been quite crowded. A 
20110124150225.000|20110124150228.000|TR0|crowd of several hundred.  But we're still 
20110124150228.000|20110124150230.000|TR0|not completely sure if that was really a 
20110124150230.000|20110124150233.000|TR0|blast at the baggage area or some place 
20110124150233.000|20110124150236.000|TR0|else at the airport just near the baggage 
20110124150236.000|20110124150238.000|TR0|area.  So it may not have been one of the 
20110124150238.000|20110124150241.000|TR0|people flying on the plane.  It may have 
20110124150241.000|20110124150243.000|TR0|just been someone in the lobby.
20110124150243.000|20110124150246.000|TR0|
20110124150246.000|20110124150249.000|TR0|KAYE:  Right.  All right.  Alexi Eremenko 
20110124150249.000|20110124150251.000|TR0|with the "Moscow Times," good to have you 
20110124150251.000|20110124150254.000|TR0|with us this morning.
20110124150254.000|20110124150256.000|TR0|
20110124150256.000|20110124150259.000|TR0|It has been a very, very busy morning 
20110124150259.000|20110124150302.000|TR0|here.  Here is what else is happening.  
20110124150302.000|20110124150304.000|TR0|Police in Detroit say the four officers 
20110124150304.000|20110124150307.000|TR0|shot in a bizarre attack are all likely to 
20110124150307.000|20110124150310.000|TR0|recover.  The gunman was killed after he 
20110124150310.000|20110124150312.000|TR0|walked into a precinct station and began 
20110124150312.000|20110124150315.000|TR0|firing.  Investigators still trying to 
20110124150315.000|20110124150317.000|TR0|identify his motive.
20110124150317.000|20110124150320.000|TR0|
20110124150320.000|20110124150323.000|TR0|Just about half an hour ago Detroit's 
20110124150323.000|20110124150325.000|TR0|police chief spoke to reporters saying 
20110124150325.000|20110124150328.000|TR0|safety protocol will change.
20110124150328.000|20110124150330.000|TR0|
20110124150330.000|20110124150333.000|TR0|New developments out of St. Petersburg, 
20110124150333.000|20110124150336.000|TR0|Florida, where police confirmed to CNN 
20110124150336.000|20110124150338.000|TR0|that two city police officers and a U.S. 
20110124150338.000|20110124150341.000|TR0|marshal have been shot and wounded while 
20110124150341.000|20110124150344.000|TR0|serving a warrant.  Gunfire broke out just 
20110124150344.000|20110124150346.000|TR0|before 7:0O this morning Eastern time.  
20110124150346.000|20110124150349.000|TR0|Officials say one wounded officer was 
20110124150349.000|20110124150351.000|TR0|stuck in the home for hours but he had 
20110124150351.000|20110124150354.000|TR0|just been removed and is now headed to the 
20110124150354.000|20110124150357.000|TR0|hospital.  The suspect still barricaded in 
20110124150357.000|20110124150359.000|TR0|the home.
20110124150359.000|20110124150402.000|TR0|
20110124150402.000|20110124150404.000|TR0|And ground breaking fitness guru Jack 
20110124150404.000|20110124150407.000|TR0|Lalanne has died.  He first preached the 
20110124150407.000|20110124150410.000|TR0|virtues of fitness on television beginning 
20110124150410.000|20110124150412.000|TR0|in the 1960s. He would tell kids to wake 
20110124150412.000|20110124150415.000|TR0|their mothers and drag them to the TV so 
20110124150415.000|20110124150418.000|TR0|they could work out.  Lallane was 96 years 
20110124150418.000|20110124150420.000|TR0|old.

20110124150423.000|20110124150425.000|TR0|A woman suspected of kidnapping a 19-day 
20110124150425.000|20110124150428.000|TR0|old infant from a New York hospital in 
20110124150428.000|20110124150431.000|TR0|1987 appears in federal court this 
20110124150431.000|20110124150433.000|TR0|morning.  Ann Pettway faces federal 
20110124150433.000|20110124150436.000|TR0|kidnapping charges.  She turned herself 
20110124150436.000|20110124150438.000|TR0|into police in Connecticut yesterday.  
20110124150438.000|20110124150441.000|TR0|Pettway's accused of snatching Carlina 
20110124150441.000|20110124150444.000|TR0|White and raising her as her own.
20110124150444.000|20110124150446.000|TR0|
20110124150446.000|20110124150449.000|TR0|White who is seen here in this composite 
20110124150449.000|20110124150451.000|TR0|sketch recently discovered her true 
20110124150451.000|20110124150454.000|TR0|identity.  She had an emotional reunion 
20110124150454.000|20110124150457.000|TR0|last week with her biological family.  Let 
20110124150457.000|20110124150459.000|TR0|me walk you back now to where this case 
20110124150459.000|20110124150502.000|TR0|first began.  In 1987 Carlina White's 
20110124150502.000|20110124150505.000|TR0|parents left her in a Harlem hospital's 
20110124150505.000|20110124150507.000|TR0|care after she'd been hit with a very high 
20110124150507.000|20110124150510.000|TR0|fever. When they returned, their 
20110124150510.000|20110124150512.000|TR0|19-day-old baby was gone.
20110124150512.000|20110124150515.000|TR0|
20110124150515.000|20110124150518.000|TR0|Vanished.  But here's the 3:00 a.m. 
20110124150518.000|20110124150520.000|TR0|wake-up call for parents. Since 1983 
20110124150520.000|20110124150523.000|TR0|nearly half of all newborns kidnapped in 
20110124150523.000|20110124150525.000|TR0|the U.S. have been snatched from 
20110124150525.000|20110124150528.000|TR0|hospitals.  CNN's senior medical 
20110124150528.000|20110124150531.000|TR0|correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins me 
20110124150531.000|20110124150533.000|TR0|now.  and really I guess, he's in the 
20110124150533.000|20110124150536.000|TR0|hospital and how do you guard yourself  
20110124150536.000|20110124150539.000|TR0|against this?

20110124150544.000|20110124150546.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  First of all, you want to 
20110124150546.000|20110124150549.000|TR0|keep in mind that this is a rare event.  I 
20110124150549.000|20110124150552.000|TR0|mean, it does happen and you want to be 
20110124150552.000|20110124150554.000|TR0|looking out for it, but it is rare.  We 
20110124150554.000|20110124150557.000|TR0|can actually show you what has happened in 
20110124150557.000|20110124150559.000|TR0|one case.  There's this video from 2008  
20110124150559.000|20110124150602.000|TR0|from a baby that was abducted from a 
20110124150602.000|20110124150605.000|TR0|hospital.  See this woman.  She's walking 
20110124150605.000|20110124150607.000|TR0|down the hallway, and she did this for 
20110124150607.000|20110124150610.000|TR0|quite a while.  She kind of walked back 
20110124150610.000|20110124150613.000|TR0|and forth.  That probably gave people a 
20110124150613.000|20110124150615.000|TR0|feeling of comfort with her.  Then she 
20110124150615.000|20110124150618.000|TR0|changed into nurses' scrubs. See there.  
20110124150618.000|20110124150620.000|TR0|She's wearing a nurse's shirt.  And you 
20110124150620.000|20110124150623.000|TR0|see her go into that room.  Now, look, 
20110124150623.000|20110124150626.000|TR0|she's coming out with a tote bag.  Randi, 
20110124150626.000|20110124150628.000|TR0|you know what's in that tote bag?

20110124150639.000|20110124150641.000|TR0|
20110124150641.000|20110124150644.000|TR0|KAYE:  Yes.     So this woman was caught, 
20110124150644.000|20110124150647.000|TR0|that baby was returned and there you see 
20110124150647.000|20110124150649.000|TR0|everyone figured it out and said, "oh, my 
20110124150649.000|20110124150652.000|TR0|gosh, what are we going to do here?"  So 
20110124150652.000|20110124150654.000|TR0|that baby was recovered.  And most of the 
20110124150654.000|20110124150657.000|TR0|time babies are recovered.  So that's good 
20110124150657.000|20110124150700.000|TR0|news.  But five are still missing.
20110124150700.000|20110124150702.000|TR0|
20110124150702.000|20110124150705.000|TR0|And this woman who we're talking about, 
20110124150705.000|20110124150707.000|TR0|the case of Carlina White, she figured it 
20110124150707.000|20110124150710.000|TR0|out all on her own.  So we have the video 
20110124150710.000|20110124150713.000|TR0|that you just showed us right there.  How 
20110124150713.000|20110124150715.000|TR0|often does something like this happen?
20110124150715.000|20110124150718.000|TR0|
20110124150718.000|20110124150721.000|TR0|COHEN:  You know, it doesn't happen al 
20110124150721.000|20110124150723.000|TR0|that often.  It happened once last year.  
20110124150723.000|20110124150726.000|TR0|It happened three times the year before.  
20110124150726.000|20110124150728.000|TR0|It doesn't happen as much now as it used 
20110124150728.000|20110124150731.000|TR0|to because hospitals are getting better. A 
20110124150731.000|20110124150734.000|TR0|lot of times the babies wear these 
20110124150734.000|20110124150736.000|TR0|bracelets where an alarm goes off if they 
20110124150736.000|20110124150739.000|TR0|get taken out.  But it certainly does 
20110124150739.000|20110124150741.000|TR0|happen.
20110124150741.000|20110124150744.000|TR0|
20110124150744.000|20110124150747.000|TR0|KAYE:  You know, too often we hear cases 
20110124150747.000|20110124150749.000|TR0|of women who have lost a baby who then go 
20110124150749.000|20110124150752.000|TR0|ahead and steal a baby.
20110124150752.000|20110124150755.000|TR0|
20110124150755.000|20110124150757.000|TR0|COHEN:  Yes.

20110124150800.000|20110124150802.000|TR0|KAYE:  Is there a profile of the 
20110124150802.000|20110124150805.000|TR0|abductors?  Is it always women?
20110124150805.000|20110124150808.000|TR0|
20110124150808.000|20110124150810.000|TR0|COHEN:  That's part of the profile.  That 
20110124150810.000|20110124150813.000|TR0|is part of the profile. What you usually 
20110124150813.000|20110124150815.000|TR0|see typically is you see a woman who has 
20110124150815.000|20110124150818.000|TR0|lost a child or for some reason can't have 
20110124150818.000|20110124150821.000|TR0|a child.  So that's part of the profile. 
20110124150821.000|20110124150823.000|TR0|Another part of the profile is these women 
20110124150823.000|20110124150826.000|TR0|tend to be around - anywhere from sort of 
20110124150826.000|20110124150829.000|TR0|- under the age of 50.  They live near the

20110124150834.000|20110124150836.000|TR0|As we said, they lost a baby or they can't 
20110124150836.000|20110124150839.000|TR0|have one and also they're in a  
20110124150839.000|20110124150842.000|TR0|relationship that's on the verge of 
20110124150842.000|20110124150844.000|TR0|collapse.  As you can see, this is a very 
20110124150844.000|20110124150847.000|TR0|emotional thing for them to be doing.
20110124150847.000|20110124150849.000|TR0|
20110124150849.000|20110124150852.000|TR0|KAYE:  And is there any way to guard 
20110124150852.000|20110124150855.000|TR0|against it?  I mean, now the hospitals do 
20110124150855.000|20110124150857.000|TR0|have security cameras.  But what can you 
20110124150857.000|20110124150900.000|TR0|do?
20110124150900.000|20110124150902.000|TR0|
20110124150902.000|20110124150905.000|TR0|COHEN:  Right.  There are a couple things 
20110124150905.000|20110124150908.000|TR0|you can do.  First of all, you should  
20110124150908.000|20110124150910.000|TR0|remember that more than half the time the 
20110124150910.000|20110124150913.000|TR0|baby is taken from the mother's room.  
20110124150913.000|20110124150916.000|TR0|They are taken from the nursery sometimes 
20110124150916.000|20110124150918.000|TR0|but most of the time taken from the  
20110124150918.000|20110124150921.000|TR0|mother's room.
20110124150921.000|20110124150923.000|TR0|
20110124150923.000|20110124150926.000|TR0|KAYE:  It's amazing you can pull it off.
20110124150926.000|20110124150929.000|TR0|
20110124150929.000|20110124150931.000|TR0|COHEN:  Yes and she wants to do is that 
20110124150931.000|20110124150934.000|TR0|you know, moms thinks, OK, I'll just go to 
20110124150934.000|20110124150936.000|TR0|the - the baby is with me, I'll just go 
20110124150936.000|20110124150939.000|TR0|use the bathroom but don't do that if you 
20110124150939.000|20110124150942.000|TR0|have to go the bathroom, even for a 
20110124150942.000|20110124150944.000|TR0|second, call the nurse and say could you 
20110124150944.000|20110124150947.000|TR0|come take the baby or sit with the baby 
20110124150947.000|20110124150950.000|TR0|while I go to the restroom.
20110124150950.000|20110124150952.000|TR0|
20110124150952.000|20110124150955.000|TR0|Also anyone who comes for your baby, ask 
20110124150955.000|20110124150957.000|TR0|for their ID.  I mean, know.  I have four 
20110124150957.000|20110124151000.000|TR0|children.  There's like tons of people 
20110124151000.000|20110124151003.000|TR0|coming in and out.  But ask for the ID.  
20110124151003.000|20110124151005.000|TR0|And then also be careful with tests. If 
20110124151005.000|20110124151008.000|TR0|someone says they're going to take your 
20110124151008.000|20110124151010.000|TR0|baby for a test, ask what test is that?  
20110124151010.000|20110124151013.000|TR0|Especially if no one told you that baby 
20110124151013.000|20110124151016.000|TR0|needed tests. You know, what tests in 
20110124151016.000|20110124151018.000|TR0|that?  Can I see your I.D.?  Who ordered 
20110124151018.000|20110124151021.000|TR0|this test?  And also anyone who you don't 
20110124151021.000|20110124151024.000|TR0|recognize, because babies are assigned 
20110124151024.000|20110124151026.000|TR0|nurses.  If this isn't your baby's nurse, 
20110124151026.000|20110124151029.000|TR0|you should be asking questions.
20110124151029.000|20110124151031.000|TR0|
20110124151031.000|20110124151034.000|TR0|KAYE:  Yes, it's so easy to pick up a

20110124151039.000|20110124151042.000|TR0|COHEN:  Right.  Every mall has a store 
20110124151042.000|20110124151044.000|TR0|where you buy one. Exactly.
20110124151044.000|20110124151047.000|TR0|

20110124151103.000|20110124151105.000|TR0|Moscow.  Richard Quest is joining me now 
20110124151105.000|20110124151108.000|TR0|from Davos.  Richard, we understand this 
20110124151108.000|20110124151111.000|TR0|may have been a suicide blast, a  
20110124151111.000|20110124151113.000|TR0|terrorist attack, according to the news 
20110124151113.000|20110124151116.000|TR0|agencies there.  You're at the airport.  
20110124151116.000|20110124151118.000|TR0|What are you seeing and what can you tell 
20110124151118.000|20110124151121.000|TR0|us?

20110124151124.000|20110124151126.000|TR0|RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, 
20110124151126.000|20110124151129.000|TR0|"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS": Well, I think 
20110124151129.000|20110124151132.000|TR0|there may be a touch of confusion at the 
20110124151132.000|20110124151134.000|TR0|moment.  I'm in Switzerland at the moment 
20110124151134.000|20110124151137.000|TR0|where, of course, the world economic forum 
20110124151137.000|20110124151139.000|TR0|is getting under way this week and where 
20110124151139.000|20110124151142.000|TR0|President Medvedev, the president of 
20110124151142.000|20110124151145.000|TR0|Russia, will be coming here and be giving 
20110124151145.000|20110124151147.000|TR0|the opening address on Wednesday.
20110124151147.000|20110124151150.000|TR0|
20110124151150.000|20110124151152.000|TR0|Now, clearly, a major terrorist attack, 
20110124151152.000|20110124151155.000|TR0|the sort of which has just taken place in 
20110124151155.000|20110124151158.000|TR0|Moscow, will very much be on his agenda.  
20110124151158.000|20110124151200.000|TR0|And when questions maybe even whether he 
20110124151200.000|20110124151203.000|TR0|would make the trip being that 20 or 30 
20110124151203.000|20110124151206.000|TR0|people are dead at Moscow's major airport.
20110124151206.000|20110124151208.000|TR0|
20110124151208.000|20110124151211.000|TR0|KAYE:  And Richard, you know the layout 
20110124151211.000|20110124151213.000|TR0|well there at the airport.  I know you're 
20110124151213.000|20110124151216.000|TR0|in Switzerland now.  But can you sort of 
20110124151216.000|20110124151219.000|TR0|take us through where this might have 
20110124151219.000|20110124151221.000|TR0|happened, if it did indeed happen in the 
20110124151221.000|20110124151224.000|TR0|baggage claim area?
20110124151224.000|20110124151226.000|TR0|
20110124151226.000|20110124151229.000|TR0|QUEST:  OK.  Just the details are 
20110124151229.000|20110124151232.000|TR0|extremely sketchy at the moment.  If this 
20110124151232.000|20110124151234.000|TR0|did happen in the baggage area as the 
20110124151234.000|20110124151237.000|TR0|first reports say, it raises the 
20110124151237.000|20110124151240.000|TR0|fundamental question for all airports.  
20110124151240.000|20110124151242.000|TR0|Usually security is tight at departures.
20110124151242.000|20110124151245.000|TR0|
20110124151245.000|20110124151247.000|TR0|Now, many airports have security when you 
20110124151247.000|20110124151250.000|TR0|enter the airport, even before you've got 
20110124151250.000|20110124151253.000|TR0|to check in.  I was in Sharm el-Sheik in 
20110124151253.000|20110124151255.000|TR0|Egypt just a couple of weeks ago.  Right 
20110124151255.000|20110124151258.000|TR0|at the entrance to the airport, there was 
20110124151258.000|20110124151300.000|TR0|a door and a security barrier to stop 
20110124151300.000|20110124151303.000|TR0|people even getting explosives into the 
20110124151303.000|20110124151306.000|TR0|building.  But arrivals has always been 
20110124151306.000|20110124151308.000|TR0|the Cinderella, if you like, of the 
20110124151308.000|20110124151311.000|TR0|building.
20110124151311.000|20110124151313.000|TR0|
20110124151313.000|20110124151316.000|TR0|Because the feeling there is people have 
20110124151316.000|20110124151319.000|TR0|taken their bags off the carousel.  Their 
20110124151319.000|20110124151321.000|TR0|bags have been scanned, and they're 
20110124151321.000|20110124151324.000|TR0|leaving the building.  If this transpires 
20110124151324.000|20110124151327.000|TR0|to be what it is at Domodedovo Airport, 
20110124151327.000|20110124151329.000|TR0|then there will have to be a rethink of 
20110124151329.000|20110124151332.000|TR0|security at all airports where suicide 
20110124151332.000|20110124151334.000|TR0|bombers are a potential risk.

20110124151347.000|20110124151350.000|TR0|Let's get now to Matthew Chance.  He's in 
20110124151350.000|20110124151353.000|TR0|Moscow at our bureau there with the very 
20110124151353.000|20110124151355.000|TR0|latest.  Matthew, what can you add to what 
20110124151355.000|20110124151358.000|TR0|Richard has already told us?
20110124151358.000|20110124151401.000|TR0|
20110124151401.000|20110124151403.000|TR0|MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL 
20110124151403.000|20110124151406.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, not a great deal in 
20110124151406.000|20110124151408.000|TR0|terms of the casualty figures.  They still 
20110124151408.000|20110124151411.000|TR0|stand at 31 people dead, according to 
20110124151411.000|20110124151414.000|TR0|Russian government officials, and 130 
20110124151414.000|20110124151416.000|TR0|people injured.  The explosion clearly 
20110124151416.000|20110124151419.000|TR0|took place in a very crowded part of what 
20110124151419.000|20110124151421.000|TR0|is the Russian capital's busiest 
20110124151421.000|20110124151424.000|TR0|international airport.
20110124151424.000|20110124151427.000|TR0|
20110124151427.000|20110124151429.000|TR0|We've just heard that the Russian 
20110124151429.000|20110124151432.000|TR0|president, Dmitri Medvedev, whom Richard 
20110124151432.000|20110124151435.000|TR0|was  talking about, will be attending 
20110124151435.000|20110124151437.000|TR0|Davos shortly, has called an emergency 
20110124151437.000|20110124151440.000|TR0|meeting at the Kremlin to discuss this 
20110124151440.000|20110124151442.000|TR0|situation with his security chiefs.  
20110124151442.000|20110124151445.000|TR0|Police around the Russian capital have 
20110124151445.000|20110124151448.000|TR0|been placed on high alert.  Not least 
20110124151448.000|20110124151450.000|TR0|because there's a possibility of more bomb 
20110124151450.000|20110124151453.000|TR0|attacks as well.  Because this isn't the 
20110124151453.000|20110124151455.000|TR0|first time, Randi, that the Russian 
20110124151455.000|20110124151458.000|TR0|capital and its transport hubs have been 
20110124151458.000|20110124151501.000|TR0|attacked by suspected suicide bomber.
20110124151501.000|20110124151503.000|TR0|
20110124151503.000|20110124151506.000|TR0|Just last year in March, in fact, multiple 
20110124151506.000|20110124151509.000|TR0|suicide bomb attacks struck the metro 
20110124151509.000|20110124151511.000|TR0|system here in Moscow, killing dozens of 
20110124151511.000|20110124151514.000|TR0|people and causing widespread panic, of 
20110124151514.000|20110124151516.000|TR0|course, and bloodshed.  There's obviously 
20110124151516.000|20110124151519.000|TR0|concern that this explosion at Domodedovo  
20110124151519.000|20110124151522.000|TR0|Airport, the main airport at the Russian 
20110124151522.000|20110124151524.000|TR0|capital could be just one of a series of 
20110124151524.000|20110124151527.000|TR0|explosions that could well take place.  
20110124151527.000|20110124151529.000|TR0|That's certainly a concern for authorities 
20110124151529.000|20110124151532.000|TR0|in place there.  Police forces on high 
20110124151532.000|20110124151535.000|TR0|alert.
20110124151535.000|20110124151537.000|TR0|
20110124151537.000|20110124151540.000|TR0|But again, the casualty figures at the 
20110124151540.000|20110124151543.000|TR0|moment stand at a terrible 31 people who 
20110124151543.000|20110124151545.000|TR0|have been killed in this explosion, 130 
20110124151545.000|20110124151548.000|TR0|have been injured according to government 
20110124151548.000|20110124151550.000|TR0|officials, Randi.
20110124151550.000|20110124151553.000|TR0|
20110124151553.000|20110124151556.000|TR0|KAYE:  And Matthew, you go in and out of 
20110124151556.000|20110124151558.000|TR0|that airport as well. How would you 
20110124151558.000|20110124151601.000|TR0|describe security and how do you get into 
20110124151601.000|20110124151603.000|TR0|that baggage reclaim area, as you  call it?
20110124151603.000|20110124151606.000|TR0|
20110124151606.000|20110124151609.000|TR0|CHANCE:  Well, first of all, it's not 
20110124151609.000|20110124151611.000|TR0|clear that the baggage reclaim area is the 
20110124151611.000|20110124151614.000|TR0|site of this explosion.  We still don't 
20110124151614.000|20110124151617.000|TR0|have that kind of information.  That's 
20110124151617.000|20110124151619.000|TR0|just one report on one Russian news 
20110124151619.000|20110124151622.000|TR0|agency.  Another agency, Interfax, is 
20110124151622.000|20110124151624.000|TR0|saying that a  suicide bomber is 
20110124151624.000|20110124151627.000|TR0|responsible for this and may have 
20110124151627.000|20110124151630.000|TR0|detonated the explosives in the departure 
20110124151630.000|20110124151632.000|TR0|area of the airport.
20110124151632.000|20110124151635.000|TR0|
20110124151635.000|20110124151637.000|TR0|Certainly what I can tell you about my 
20110124151637.000|20110124151640.000|TR0|experience traveling out of Domodedovo and 
20110124151640.000|20110124151643.000|TR0|I've done that quiet a lot, obviously over 
20110124151643.000|20110124151645.000|TR0|the past several years is that it has very 
20110124151645.000|20110124151648.000|TR0|tight security indeed as you moved through 
20110124151648.000|20110124151651.000|TR0|the check in areas, the outside areas, the 
20110124151651.000|20110124151653.000|TR0|departure area where relatives come and 
20110124151653.000|20110124151656.000|TR0|see their loved ones off.  This relatively 
20110124151656.000|20110124151658.000|TR0|lax security around there and as there is 
20110124151658.000|20110124151701.000|TR0|in many airports, the security guards on 
20110124151701.000|20110124151704.000|TR0|the doors, a police presence, but you 
20110124151704.000|20110124151706.000|TR0|don't have to go through metal detectors 
20110124151706.000|20110124151709.000|TR0|to actually get into the airport building.
20110124151709.000|20110124151711.000|TR0|
20110124151711.000|20110124151714.000|TR0|It's once you check your baggage in and 
20110124151714.000|20110124151717.000|TR0|you go through to check- in and passport 
20110124151717.000|20110124151719.000|TR0|control, that's when the security really 
20110124151719.000|20110124151722.000|TR0|starts.  And that's where Domodedovo 
20110124151722.000|20110124151724.000|TR0|Airport which remember has been affected 
20110124151724.000|20110124151727.000|TR0|by suicide bombers in the past, back in 
20110124151727.000|20110124151730.000|TR0|2004, that's where (INAUDIBLE) Airport now 
20110124151730.000|20110124151732.000|TR0|has it's state of the art security, 
20110124151732.000|20110124151735.000|TR0|surveillance cameras, it's high tech 
20110124151735.000|20110124151738.000|TR0|scanning equipment so it will be very 
20110124151738.000|20110124151740.000|TR0|difficult, if not impossible for a suicide 
20110124151740.000|20110124151743.000|TR0|bomber or somebody carrying a bomb to  get 
20110124151743.000|20110124151745.000|TR0|through that very tough airport 
20110124151745.000|20110124151748.000|TR0|international standard security that it 
20110124151748.000|20110124151751.000|TR0|has before you get into the check-in area. 
20110124151751.000|20110124151753.000|TR0| But before then, again, it's  possible, 
20110124151753.000|20110124151756.000|TR0|apparently.

20110124151819.000|20110124151822.000|TR0|news out of Moscow.  An explosion has 
20110124151822.000|20110124151825.000|TR0|ripped through the city's international 
20110124151825.000|20110124151827.000|TR0|airport.  The government says at least 31 
20110124151827.000|20110124151830.000|TR0|people are dead, 130 wounded.  Let's get

20110124151835.000|20110124151838.000|TR0|do you make of this?
20110124151838.000|20110124151840.000|TR0|
20110124151840.000|20110124151843.000|TR0|JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
20110124151843.000|20110124151846.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well I think, you know, 
20110124151846.000|20110124151848.000|TR0|the real question is where that - well, 
20110124151848.000|20110124151851.000|TR0|number one, who did it.  But also where it 
20110124151851.000|20110124151853.000|TR0|happened in terms of future security 
20110124151853.000|20110124151856.000|TR0|because as Matthew pointed out, when you 
20110124151856.000|20110124151859.000|TR0|come into the airport, and that is, 
20110124151859.000|20110124151901.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) is a modern airport.  It does, 
20110124151901.000|20110124151904.000|TR0|inside, have pretty much state of the art 
20110124151904.000|20110124151906.000|TR0|security in many areas.
20110124151906.000|20110124151909.000|TR0|
20110124151909.000|20110124151912.000|TR0|The one place that could be vulnerable is 
20110124151912.000|20110124151914.000|TR0|the curb side area. Usually at the major 
20110124151914.000|20110124151917.000|TR0|airports in Russia they check your bags, 
20110124151917.000|20110124151920.000|TR0|they scan your bags as you come  into the 
20110124151920.000|20110124151922.000|TR0|airport, but they don't scan you. So if 
20110124151922.000|20110124151925.000|TR0|this was, and there are big ifs here, a 
20110124151925.000|20110124151927.000|TR0|suicide bomber, potentially, and we'd have 
20110124151927.000|20110124151930.000|TR0|to see how it was set up that day, but 
20110124151930.000|20110124151933.000|TR0|potentially that could be a chink in the 
20110124151933.000|20110124151935.000|TR0|armor.
20110124151935.000|20110124151938.000|TR0|
20110124151938.000|20110124151940.000|TR0|Also, you know, who did it, the immediate 
20110124151940.000|20110124151943.000|TR0|concern would be somebody coming from  the 
20110124151943.000|20110124151946.000|TR0|caucuses, from Chechnya, still continues 
20110124151946.000|20110124151948.000|TR0|to be unstable.  And of course, there has 
20110124151948.000|20110124151951.000|TR0|to be an investigation.  Nobody knows.  
20110124151951.000|20110124151954.000|TR0|It's very early at this point.  But that

20110124152038.000|20110124152041.000|TR0|means it was not that really secure area

20110124152130.000|20110124152133.000|TR0|it, I think it is anybody's guess at this 
20110124152133.000|20110124152135.000|TR0|point.  The Russian government, of course,

20110124152644.000|20110124152647.000|TR0|understand. And the fact that we've known

20110124152718.000|20110124152721.000|TR0|seven people from a church in Kansas 
20110124152721.000|20110124152723.000|TR0|turned out for the premiere of Kevin 
20110124152723.000|20110124152726.000|TR0|Smith's movie, "Red State."  It's a horror

20110124152731.000|20110124152734.000|TR0|And I talked to the protesters and they

20110124152736.000|20110124152739.000|TR0|contents of the film and they thought it 
20110124152739.000|20110124152742.000|TR0|was filth. Well, Kevin Smith himself and 
20110124152742.000|20110124152744.000|TR0|high schoolers, kids from Park City High 
20110124152744.000|20110124152747.000|TR0|School's Gay-Straight Alliance turned out

20110124153327.000|20110124153329.000|TR0|is on tap for the Northeast, with even 
20110124153329.000|20110124153332.000|TR0|parts of the South again seeing more snow.

20110124153335.000|20110124153337.000|TR0|Ground breaking fitness guru Jack Lalanne 
20110124153337.000|20110124153340.000|TR0|has died.  He first preached the virtues 
20110124153340.000|20110124153342.000|TR0|of fitness on TV.  He would tell kids to 
20110124153342.000|20110124153345.000|TR0|wake their mothers and drag them to the 
20110124153345.000|20110124153348.000|TR0|television so they could work out. Lalanne 
20110124153348.000|20110124153350.000|TR0|was 96 years old.

20110124153353.000|20110124153355.000|TR0|The State of the Union address.  It's kind 
20110124153355.000|20110124153358.000|TR0|of an annual progress report on the nation 
20110124153358.000|20110124153401.000|TR0|and the government.  Tomorrow night, 
20110124153401.000|20110124153403.000|TR0|President Obama will also focus on other 
20110124153403.000|20110124153406.000|TR0|matters of vital interest to all of us, 
20110124153406.000|20110124153409.000|TR0|such as the economy, your money, your job 
20110124153409.000|20110124153411.000|TR0|and your future.  They are all central 
20110124153411.000|20110124153414.000|TR0|themes of tomorrow's primetime address.
20110124153414.000|20110124153416.000|TR0|
20110124153416.000|20110124153419.000|TR0|President Obama dominates the spotlight 
20110124153419.000|20110124153422.000|TR0|and the agenda with tomorrow night's State 
20110124153422.000|20110124153424.000|TR0|of the Union address, then lawmakers get 
20110124153424.000|20110124153427.000|TR0|their turn to spin the facts and make 
20110124153427.000|20110124153429.000|TR0|their case.  So, we want to hear from 
20110124153429.000|20110124153432.000|TR0|experts.  What is the State of the Union 
20110124153432.000|20110124153435.000|TR0|when it comes to the military?  CNN 
20110124153435.000|20110124153437.000|TR0|Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence has 
20110124153437.000|20110124153440.000|TR0|turned to a number of leading experts.
20110124153440.000|20110124153442.000|TR0|
20110124153442.000|20110124153445.000|TR0|And Chris, good morning to you.  Let's 
20110124153445.000|20110124153448.000|TR0|begin with the human element of this 
20110124153448.000|20110124153450.000|TR0|equation.
20110124153450.000|20110124153453.000|TR0|
20110124153453.000|20110124153456.000|TR0|CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON 
20110124153456.000|20110124153458.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's right, Randi.  
20110124153458.000|20110124153501.000|TR0|We spoke with some of the best defense 
20110124153501.000|20110124153503.000|TR0|experts in the country. Some more liberal, 
20110124153503.000|20110124153506.000|TR0|some very conservative.  In other words, 
20110124153506.000|20110124153509.000|TR0|we didn't rely on just one point of view.  
20110124153509.000|20110124153511.000|TR0|We combined all of their insight to find 
20110124153511.000|20110124153514.000|TR0|that when it comes to caring for the 
20110124153514.000|20110124153516.000|TR0|troops, the State of the Union is strong.  
20110124153516.000|20110124153519.000|TR0|     Why do the experts say that?  Because 
20110124153519.000|20110124153522.000|TR0|they say when it comes to getting physical 
20110124153522.000|20110124153524.000|TR0|care, these troops are getting the best in 
20110124153524.000|20110124153527.000|TR0|the world. You sort of saw that with the 
20110124153527.000|20110124153530.000|TR0|care for Gabrielle Giffords, how one of 
20110124153530.000|20110124153532.000|TR0|the trauma surgeons who helped saved her 
20110124153532.000|20110124153535.000|TR0|got his experience in the battlefield with 
20110124153535.000|20110124153537.000|TR0|the Navy.
20110124153537.000|20110124153540.000|TR0|
20110124153540.000|20110124153543.000|TR0|But it goes beyond just fixing wounds, 
20110124153543.000|20110124153545.000|TR0|patching up injuries. Also it means 
20110124153545.000|20110124153548.000|TR0|support for families.  They say there are 
20110124153548.000|20110124153550.000|TR0|more programs for kids whose mom or dad 
20110124153550.000|20110124153553.000|TR0|may be deployed.  Military families are 
20110124153553.000|20110124153556.000|TR0|getting better housing now, especially 
20110124153556.000|20110124153558.000|TR0|compared to where the military was, say, 
20110124153558.000|20110124153601.000|TR0|20 years ago after the first Gulf War.
20110124153601.000|20110124153604.000|TR0|
20110124153604.000|20110124153606.000|TR0|Obviously across the board, all the 
20110124153606.000|20110124153609.000|TR0|experts felt that post- traumatic stress 
20110124153609.000|20110124153611.000|TR0|disorder and traumatic brain injuries were 
20110124153611.000|20110124153614.000|TR0|huge problems.  They say the military has 
20110124153614.000|20110124153617.000|TR0|made it a priority, and while they haven't 
20110124153617.000|20110124153619.000|TR0|solved the problems yet, they're not 
20110124153619.000|20110124153622.000|TR0|ignoring it. Although one expert did say 
20110124153622.000|20110124153624.000|TR0|it is -- the problem is so severe, it's 
20110124153624.000|20110124153627.000|TR0|foolish to say we're doing enough.  He 
20110124153627.000|20110124153630.000|TR0|said the real sadness of the last ten 
20110124153630.000|20110124153632.000|TR0|years is that the military didn't do 
20110124153632.000|20110124153635.000|TR0|enough or the nation didn't do enough to 
20110124153635.000|20110124153638.000|TR0|increase the size of the Army and Marine 
20110124153638.000|20110124153640.000|TR0|Corps much sooner.  Randi?
20110124153640.000|20110124153643.000|TR0|
20110124153643.000|20110124153645.000|TR0|KAYE:  And Chris, let's turn our attention 
20110124153645.000|20110124153648.000|TR0|now to military preparedness.  What is the 
20110124153648.000|20110124153651.000|TR0|State of the Union when it comes to that?
20110124153651.000|20110124153653.000|TR0|
20110124153653.000|20110124153656.000|TR0|LAWRENCE: Well, again, combing the insight 
20110124153656.000|20110124153658.000|TR0|from all of our experts, they found that 
20110124153658.000|20110124153701.000|TR0|when it comes to preparedness, in other 
20110124153701.000|20110124153704.000|TR0|words, how ready is the military to fight 
20110124153704.000|20110124153706.000|TR0|a war, they found that the State of the 
20110124153706.000|20110124153709.000|TR0|Union right now is strong.
20110124153709.000|20110124153712.000|TR0|
20110124153712.000|20110124153714.000|TR0|Again, why?  Because they feel like the 
20110124153714.000|20110124153717.000|TR0|ground forces are right now the most 
20110124153717.000|20110124153719.000|TR0|combat experienced, the most professional, 
20110124153719.000|20110124153722.000|TR0|the most well educated that the United 
20110124153722.000|20110124153725.000|TR0|States has ever seen.  They're extremely 
20110124153725.000|20110124153727.000|TR0|capable of fighting a counterinsurgency 
20110124153727.000|20110124153730.000|TR0|war.  Even though they say the ground 
20110124153730.000|20110124153732.000|TR0|forces haven't trained extensively on an 
20110124153732.000|20110124153735.000|TR0|army-on-army conventional warfare, they 
20110124153735.000|20110124153738.000|TR0|say battle-hardened troops tend to be more 
20110124153738.000|20110124153740.000|TR0|proficient across the board.
20110124153740.000|20110124153743.000|TR0|
20110124153743.000|20110124153746.000|TR0|Now, there are some problems.  Why didn't 
20110124153746.000|20110124153748.000|TR0|they get a very strong? Because they said 
20110124153748.000|20110124153751.000|TR0|when a military like the United States is 
20110124153751.000|20110124153753.000|TR0|preoccupied with short-term conflicts, 
20110124153753.000|20110124153756.000|TR0|they say it's putting some of its best 
20110124153756.000|20110124153759.000|TR0|people, like a General Petraeus, in charge 
20110124153759.000|20110124153801.000|TR0|of immediate operational planning.  That's 
20110124153801.000|20110124153804.000|TR0|sort of a brain drain on the big picture, 
20110124153804.000|20110124153806.000|TR0|long-term thinking.  They say by its very 
20110124153806.000|20110124153809.000|TR0|definition, you're not going to have the 
20110124153809.000|20110124153812.000|TR0|same creative juices going into that 
20110124153812.000|20110124153814.000|TR0|long-term planning.
20110124153814.000|20110124153817.000|TR0|
20110124153817.000|20110124153820.000|TR0|They also say there's a real problem with 
20110124153820.000|20110124153822.000|TR0|us, society in general, in that fewer and 
20110124153822.000|20110124153825.000|TR0|fewer people are really qualified to be in 
20110124153825.000|20110124153827.000|TR0|the military.  Both physically, you know, 
20110124153827.000|20110124153830.000|TR0|too fat, overweight, or they have criminal 
20110124153830.000|20110124153833.000|TR0|records or just don't have the mental 
20110124153833.000|20110124153835.000|TR0|skills to deal with what the military 
20110124153835.000|20110124153838.000|TR0|needs them to do these days.  They say 
20110124153838.000|20110124153840.000|TR0|that could be a big problem going down the 
20110124153840.000|20110124153843.000|TR0|road.
20110124153843.000|20110124153846.000|TR0|
20110124153846.000|20110124153848.000|TR0|KAYE:  And, Chris, when it comes to 
20110124153848.000|20110124153851.000|TR0|equipment, how is the U.S. military rated 
20110124153851.000|20110124153853.000|TR0|in that regard?       LAWRENCE: Of the 
20110124153853.000|20110124153856.000|TR0|three, our experts felt that this one 
20110124153856.000|20110124153859.000|TR0|rated the lowest.  They said when it comes 
20110124153859.000|20110124153901.000|TR0|to the equipment of the military right 
20110124153901.000|20110124153904.000|TR0|now, the State of the Union is improving.  
20110124153904.000|20110124153907.000|TR0|What they mean by that is the military 
20110124153907.000|20110124153909.000|TR0|recognizes that the equipment is worn 
20110124153909.000|20110124153912.000|TR0|down, it needs to be heavily refurbished 
20110124153912.000|20110124153914.000|TR0|or replaced, but they haven't done much to 
20110124153914.000|20110124153917.000|TR0|actually get that program going yet.  They 
20110124153917.000|20110124153920.000|TR0|said they found some real problems even 
20110124153920.000|20110124153922.000|TR0|with things you wouldn't think about in a 
20110124153922.000|20110124153925.000|TR0|ground war.  You would expect the Army and 
20110124153925.000|20110124153927.000|TR0|the Marine Corps equipment to be severely 
20110124153927.000|20110124153930.000|TR0|run down, and the experts found that.
20110124153930.000|20110124153933.000|TR0|
20110124153933.000|20110124153935.000|TR0|But they said even the Air Force, they 
20110124153935.000|20110124153938.000|TR0|said -- one expert said, you know, some of 
20110124153938.000|20110124153941.000|TR0|the pilots are flying airplanes that are 
20110124153941.000|20110124153943.000|TR0|older than they are.  So, they say that 
20110124153943.000|20110124153946.000|TR0|will be a huge challenge going forward 
20110124153946.000|20110124153948.000|TR0|down the road in that, you know, we're 
20110124153948.000|20110124153951.000|TR0|going to have less resources, you know, 
20110124153951.000|20110124153954.000|TR0|diminished budgets.  And they said it 
20110124153954.000|20110124153956.000|TR0|could cost billions to try to replace some 
20110124153956.000|20110124153959.000|TR0|of this equipment.  Randi?

20110124154030.000|20110124154033.000|TR0|We want to get you now to some new 
20110124154033.000|20110124154035.000|TR0|information coming to us from Russian 
20110124154035.000|20110124154038.000|TR0|state TV.  We've been talking now all 
20110124154038.000|20110124154041.000|TR0|morning about this apparent suicide blast 
20110124154041.000|20110124154043.000|TR0|at one of the city's most -- one of the 
20110124154043.000|20110124154046.000|TR0|city's busiest airports there in Moscow.  
20110124154046.000|20110124154049.000|TR0|The new information coming to us now is 
20110124154049.000|20110124154051.000|TR0|that it was, indeed, a suicide bomber, 
20110124154051.000|20110124154054.000|TR0|according to Russian state TV.  And that 
20110124154054.000|20110124154056.000|TR0|it was a handmade bomb stuffed with small 
20110124154056.000|20110124154059.000|TR0|metal objects to cause even more injuries, 
20110124154059.000|20110124154102.000|TR0|we're being told.
20110124154102.000|20110124154104.000|TR0|
20110124154104.000|20110124154107.000|TR0|The terrorist, suspected terrorist, 
20110124154107.000|20110124154109.000|TR0|activated it in the crowded departure 
20110124154109.000|20110124154112.000|TR0|area.  We were first hearing this might 
20110124154112.000|20110124154115.000|TR0|have occurred in the baggage claim area.  
20110124154115.000|20110124154117.000|TR0|Now they're telling us the crowded 
20110124154117.000|20110124154120.000|TR0|departure area where many people were 
20110124154120.000|20110124154123.000|TR0|gathering preparing for their lives.
20110124154123.000|20110124154125.000|TR0|
20110124154125.000|20110124154128.000|TR0|This is all happening at the Domodedovo 
20110124154128.000|20110124154130.000|TR0|International Airport in Moscow.  The 
20110124154130.000|20110124154133.000|TR0|blast happened at about 4:40 p.m. local 
20110124154133.000|20110124154136.000|TR0|time in Moscow. And in terms of injuries, 
20110124154136.000|20110124154138.000|TR0|130 injured, we're being told, and at 
20110124154138.000|20110124154141.000|TR0|least 30 dead.

20110124154146.000|20110124154149.000|TR0|all things inside the Beltway.  Just a day 
20110124154149.000|20110124154151.000|TR0|before the president delivers his State of 
20110124154151.000|20110124154154.000|TR0|the Union address, one senator wants his

20110124154159.000|20110124154202.000|TR0|Love, sex and marriage.  They don't always 
20110124154202.000|20110124154204.000|TR0|go hand in hand.  New research says 
20110124154204.000|20110124154207.000|TR0|someone is getting gypped.  We're talking 
20110124154207.000|20110124154210.000|TR0|with one of the authors of that research.

20110124154223.000|20110124154225.000|TR0|KAYE:  Let's talk about sex, money and 
20110124154225.000|20110124154228.000|TR0|marriage.  New research shows that men 
20110124154228.000|20110124154231.000|TR0|appear to have the upper hand when it 
20110124154231.000|20110124154233.000|TR0|comes to relationships.  And that trend 
20110124154233.000|20110124154236.000|TR0|now affecting the younger generation.
20110124154236.000|20110124154238.000|TR0|
20110124154238.000|20110124154241.000|TR0|The research says young women in the 18- 
20110124154241.000|20110124154244.000|TR0|to 23-year-old group don't feel they need 
20110124154244.000|20110124154246.000|TR0|a man to help with finances.  And many of 
20110124154246.000|20110124154249.000|TR0|them say they can fool around with 
20110124154249.000|20110124154251.000|TR0|multiple partners without consequences. 
20110124154251.000|20110124154254.000|TR0|They say your early 20s is not the time 
20110124154254.000|20110124154257.000|TR0|for a serious relationship.
20110124154257.000|20110124154259.000|TR0|
20110124154259.000|20110124154302.000|TR0|But problem is, when they are ready for 
20110124154302.000|20110124154304.000|TR0|commitment, there are still plenty of 
20110124154304.000|20110124154307.000|TR0|women out there ready to have 
20110124154307.000|20110124154310.000|TR0|no-strings-attached hook-ups.  As one 
20110124154310.000|20110124154312.000|TR0|finding from the new book, "Premarital Sex

20110124154333.000|20110124154336.000|TR0|
20110124154336.000|20110124154338.000|TR0|KAYE:  Interesting topic.  In doing this 
20110124154338.000|20110124154341.000|TR0|research, what surprised you most about 
20110124154341.000|20110124154344.000|TR0|unmarried young adults?
20110124154344.000|20110124154346.000|TR0|
20110124154346.000|20110124154349.000|TR0|REGNERUS:  Right.  The thing that 
20110124154349.000|20110124154352.000|TR0|surprised me the most is how male-centered 
20110124154352.000|20110124154354.000|TR0|the - the sort of the sexual economy is 
20110124154354.000|20110124154357.000|TR0|when you're talking about 18- to 
20110124154357.000|20110124154359.000|TR0|23-year-olds.  Men really do seem to be 
20110124154359.000|20110124154402.000|TR0|calling the shots.  Which is ironic in the 
20110124154402.000|20110124154405.000|TR0|sense -- compared to how successful young 
20110124154405.000|20110124154407.000|TR0|women have been educationally and 
20110124154407.000|20110124154410.000|TR0|economically.  That success just isn't 
20110124154410.000|20110124154412.000|TR0|automatically translating into their 
20110124154412.000|20110124154415.000|TR0|relationship life.
20110124154415.000|20110124154418.000|TR0|
20110124154418.000|20110124154420.000|TR0|And part of the reason, I think, is 
20110124154420.000|20110124154423.000|TR0|because we're seeing a shift in what 
20110124154423.000|20110124154426.000|TR0|people expect out of relationships, out of 
20110124154426.000|20110124154428.000|TR0|marriage.  Women don't really need men 
20110124154428.000|20110124154431.000|TR0|like they used to economically and 
20110124154431.000|20110124154433.000|TR0|socially. And so when women don't really 
20110124154433.000|20110124154436.000|TR0|need men, the nature of how relationships 
20110124154436.000|20110124154439.000|TR0|develop, we argue, is going to change.  
20110124154439.000|20110124154441.000|TR0|And it has, in fact, changed.
20110124154441.000|20110124154444.000|TR0|
20110124154444.000|20110124154446.000|TR0|KAYE:  And what did you find in terms of 
20110124154446.000|20110124154449.000|TR0|how young adults view marriage?  Not much 
20110124154449.000|20110124154452.000|TR0|permanence there, is that correct?
20110124154452.000|20110124154454.000|TR0|
20110124154454.000|20110124154457.000|TR0|REGNERUS:  Well, they tend to think that 
20110124154457.000|20110124154500.000|TR0|their marriages will be permanent, but 
20110124154500.000|20110124154502.000|TR0|that about half of all marriages out there 
20110124154502.000|20110124154505.000|TR0|will not be permanent --
20110124154505.000|20110124154507.000|TR0|
20110124154507.000|20110124154510.000|TR0|KAYE:  So, they'll do better.
20110124154510.000|20110124154513.000|TR0|
20110124154513.000|20110124154515.000|TR0|REGNERUS:  Exactly.  But since these are 
20110124154515.000|20110124154518.000|TR0|18- to 23-year-olds, most of them are not 
20110124154518.000|20110124154520.000|TR0|seriously thinking about marriage.  And so 
20110124154520.000|20110124154523.000|TR0|now is the time to travel, to finish your 
20110124154523.000|20110124154526.000|TR0|education.  Your parents certainly don't 
20110124154526.000|20110124154528.000|TR0|want you marrying at this age.
20110124154528.000|20110124154531.000|TR0|
20110124154531.000|20110124154534.000|TR0|So, they push all these things off.  But 
20110124154534.000|20110124154536.000|TR0|this is sort of the peak period of sexual 
20110124154536.000|20110124154539.000|TR0|activity and interest.  And so we delay 
20110124154539.000|20110124154541.000|TR0|marriage, but we certainly don't delay 
20110124154541.000|20110124154544.000|TR0|sexual behavior.  But we often find that 
20110124154544.000|20110124154547.000|TR0|if you're not careful about how you go 
20110124154547.000|20110124154549.000|TR0|about relationships, landing that mate, 
20110124154549.000|20110124154552.000|TR0|landing the security of marriage, can 
20110124154552.000|20110124154554.000|TR0|become a challenge.

20110124154605.000|20110124154608.000|TR0|what about these younger adults?  You 
20110124154608.000|20110124154610.000|TR0|spoke to adults who were 18 to 23.

20110124154623.000|20110124154626.000|TR0|REGNERUS:  Right.  Well, typically, you 
20110124154626.000|20110124154628.000|TR0|see women who are more interested in 
20110124154628.000|20110124154631.000|TR0|commitment than men are.  We're not 
20110124154631.000|20110124154634.000|TR0|talking about women wanting to marry these 
20110124154634.000|20110124154636.000|TR0|people, necessarily.
20110124154636.000|20110124154639.000|TR0|
20110124154639.000|20110124154642.000|TR0|But women don't have the upper hand in 
20110124154642.000|20110124154644.000|TR0|this sexual economy.  And so what men want 
20110124154644.000|20110124154647.000|TR0|tends to emerge.  And sometimes fairly 
20110124154647.000|20110124154649.000|TR0|quickly.  We found that nearly half of 
20110124154649.000|20110124154652.000|TR0|men's relationships turned sexual, meaning 
20110124154652.000|20110124154655.000|TR0|they added sex to the relationship, within 
20110124154655.000|20110124154657.000|TR0|a month of the formation of that 
20110124154657.000|20110124154700.000|TR0|relationship.  And a majority of those, it 
20110124154700.000|20110124154702.000|TR0|happened within two weeks.  And plenty of 
20110124154702.000|20110124154705.000|TR0|the people we talked to, it happened even 
20110124154705.000|20110124154708.000|TR0|before the relationship started.  Which is 
20110124154708.000|20110124154710.000|TR0|not a good key to commitment in a 
20110124154710.000|20110124154713.000|TR0|relationship.
20110124154713.000|20110124154715.000|TR0|
20110124154715.000|20110124154718.000|TR0|Now, plenty of people don't want that 
20110124154718.000|20110124154721.000|TR0|commitment just yet.  But when you do 
20110124154721.000|20110124154723.000|TR0|eventually want commitment, what you have 
20110124154723.000|20110124154726.000|TR0|done up to that point matters.  One of the 
20110124154726.000|20110124154729.000|TR0|things we talk about is there's no 
20110124154729.000|20110124154731.000|TR0|completely discreet sex.  Every sexual act 
20110124154731.000|20110124154734.000|TR0|is sort of a price point in what people 
20110124154734.000|20110124154736.000|TR0|will expect next in their relationships.

20110124154939.000|20110124154942.000|TR0|DIRECTOR:  Hey, good morning, Randi.  That 
20110124154942.000|20110124154945.000|TR0|former senator is George Allen of 
20110124154945.000|20110124154947.000|TR0|Virginia. Remember, six years ago, he was 
20110124154947.000|20110124154950.000|TR0|the favorite to win re-election, maybe 
20110124154950.000|20110124154952.000|TR0|going to run for the White House.  But he 
20110124154952.000|20110124154955.000|TR0|used a racial slur, it went viral on 
20110124154955.000|20110124154958.000|TR0|YouTube,  which back then was in its 
20110124154958.000|20110124155000.000|TR0|infancy, and he lost to Jim Webb, the 
20110124155000.000|20110124155003.000|TR0|Democrat.
20110124155003.000|20110124155005.000|TR0|
20110124155005.000|20110124155008.000|TR0|Now we expect today that George Allen will

20110124155032.000|20110124155034.000|TR0|re-election next year.  They say he's not 
20110124155034.000|20110124155037.000|TR0|conservative enough.  Lugar says, I am 
20110124155037.000|20110124155039.000|TR0|running for re-election.  Randi?

20110124155200.000|20110124155203.000|TR0|Because, you know, my one chance -- if I 
20110124155203.000|20110124155206.000|TR0|have a chance, is that -- I'm considered a

20110124155216.000|20110124155219.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  So, the more Republicans in 
20110124155219.000|20110124155221.000|TR0|which I can show a contrast, probably the 
20110124155221.000|20110124155224.000|TR0|better chance -- the better chance that I

20110124155253.000|20110124155255.000|TR0|not being acceptable.  My slogan was, you

20110124155430.000|20110124155432.000|TR0|Lots of problems there.

20110124155440.000|20110124155443.000|TR0|the weather was wicked all weekend long.  
20110124155443.000|20110124155445.000|TR0|A lot of it caught on tape, Reynolds.

20110124155448.000|20110124155450.000|TR0|REYNOLDS WOLF, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  
20110124155450.000|20110124155453.000|TR0|Absolutely.

20110124155501.000|20110124155504.000|TR0|WOLF:  I'd love to.  Let's get things 
20110124155504.000|20110124155506.000|TR0|started.  This is a new little segment we 
20110124155506.000|20110124155509.000|TR0|have, "The Weekend Rewind."  We'll begin 
20110124155509.000|20110124155511.000|TR0|in Ontario, Canada.  Just a horrible thing 
20110124155511.000|20110124155514.000|TR0|to see.  This was all caught on dash cam.  
20110124155514.000|20110124155517.000|TR0|A tractor trailer blasted right through a 
20110124155517.000|20110124155519.000|TR0|guardrail, carrying 30 tons of sand.  
20110124155519.000|20110124155522.000|TR0|Other vehicles were involved.  Thankfully, 
20110124155522.000|20110124155524.000|TR0|though, no injuries.
20110124155524.000|20110124155527.000|TR0|
20110124155527.000|20110124155530.000|TR0|Now, get this, Randi.  The truck driver 
20110124155530.000|20110124155532.000|TR0|blamed it on poor weather conditions.  I'm 
20110124155532.000|20110124155535.000|TR0|sure he did.
20110124155535.000|20110124155537.000|TR0|
20110124155537.000|20110124155540.000|TR0|All right.  We're going to jump from that 
20110124155540.000|20110124155543.000|TR0|video to some other compelling video from 
20110124155543.000|20110124155545.000|TR0|Salt Lake City, Utah.  Have you ever heard 
20110124155545.000|20110124155548.000|TR0|of a great new sport founded by a couple 
20110124155548.000|20110124155551.000|TR0|of fraternity guys called skouching?
20110124155551.000|20110124155553.000|TR0|
20110124155553.000|20110124155556.000|TR0|KAYE:  You hold the record for this one, 
20110124155556.000|20110124155558.000|TR0|don't you?     WOLF:  Yes, we do what we 
20110124155558.000|20110124155601.000|TR0|can.  What you do is you get an old couch, 
20110124155601.000|20110124155604.000|TR0|you put some skis on the bottom, and then 
20110124155604.000|20110124155606.000|TR0|you push it.  Not sure it'll make it to 
20110124155606.000|20110124155609.000|TR0|the next Olympic Winter Games.  But it 
20110124155609.000|20110124155611.000|TR0|sure looks promising.  But the thing is, 
20110124155611.000|20110124155614.000|TR0|you can't take it up on a lift. You 
20110124155614.000|20110124155617.000|TR0|basically have to push it right back up on 
20110124155617.000|20110124155619.000|TR0|the hill on your own and repeat the 
20110124155619.000|20110124155622.000|TR0|process.
20110124155622.000|20110124155625.000|TR0|
20110124155625.000|20110124155627.000|TR0|Now we're going to go from that to 
20110124155627.000|20110124155630.000|TR0|something in Half Moon Bay, California.  
20110124155630.000|20110124155632.000|TR0|Surfers, beware.  It was a series of three 
20110124155632.000|20110124155635.000|TR0|waves. Normally, they come in sets of two. 
20110124155635.000|20110124155638.000|TR0| The third wave, unbelievable. Just 
20110124155638.000|20110124155640.000|TR0|pummeled the surfer.  A rescue crew had to 
20110124155640.000|20110124155643.000|TR0|go out, pick up the surfer, bring him in.  
20110124155643.000|20110124155645.000|TR0|He's now in critical condition.  A 
20110124155645.000|20110124155648.000|TR0|terrifying event.  Normally, in that part 
20110124155648.000|20110124155651.000|TR0|of the world, they come in big, smooth 
20110124155651.000|20110124155653.000|TR0|sets.  Great for longboarders.  But there 
20110124155653.000|20110124155656.000|TR0|was a third wave that came in, the guy was 
20110124155656.000|20110124155659.000|TR0|caught unaware and, again, recovering in a 
20110124155659.000|20110124155701.000|TR0|hospital. Thankfully, he didn't lose his 
20110124155701.000|20110124155704.000|TR0|life.  Terrifying thing to see.
20110124155704.000|20110124155706.000|TR0|
20110124155706.000|20110124155709.000|TR0|Two scary videos.  One, the skouching.  
20110124155709.000|20110124155712.000|TR0|Terrifying, but in an entirely different 
20110124155712.000|20110124155714.000|TR0|way, you know?  Things are a little bit 
20110124155714.000|20110124155717.000|TR0|different with that.

20110124155727.000|20110124155730.000|TR0|my couch back up the hill and then do it 
20110124155730.000|20110124155733.000|TR0|again.  One run for me.  On the bunny hill.

20110124155854.000|20110124155856.000|TR0|the top Navy official today.  The videos 
20110124155856.000|20110124155859.000|TR0|contain foul language, anti-gay slurs and 
20110124155859.000|20110124155901.000|TR0|simulated sex acts.  Navy Captain Owen 
20110124155901.000|20110124155904.000|TR0|Honors, second in command on the 
20110124155904.000|20110124155907.000|TR0|Enterprise, appears in those videos and

20110124155922.000|20110124155925.000|TR0|Caylee.  It is expected her 
20110124155925.000|20110124155928.000|TR0|court-appointed lawyers will actually ask 
20110124155928.000|20110124155930.000|TR0|for more money for investigative work.  
20110124155930.000|20110124155933.000|TR0|This will be a third request for more cash
