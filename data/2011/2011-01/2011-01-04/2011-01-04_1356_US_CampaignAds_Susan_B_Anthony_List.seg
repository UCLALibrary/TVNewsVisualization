20110104135603.330|20110104140223.240|TR1|about fifteen dash so pro-life democrats who were so-called non and voted for abortion and health care will tell you life matters an election sank in and it's asif centerpiece of winning and losing elections in recent interviews done with all of you and it if you look burned your your support of the right to life of the unborn child on given this permanent final commitment and imported coalition partner that pro-lifers are in races tried as an activist had seen a disconnect an r_n_c_ operations so specifically what steps would you take as a tactician to integrate the issue and to messaging coalitions technology and all financial and other assets that are at your disposal as chair specialists off patent well let me let me use the example what we did in michigan we worked very closely with more to life and other groups that we were able to do on a regular basis sitting down and identify who the candidates word with potential candidates now what kind of resources were needed what we can you legally together what we couldn't do together what we had to independently et cetera sought i think that there has to be a working relationship with all the coalitions and particularly those who support the uh... the sanctity of life i think that's a look you know when we run for office i think it's very important for us to stand on our principles i think that uh... ideas have consequences i think that issues matter and when we run away from those issues we run away from opportunities will run away from voters we shouldn't hide where we stand on issues it does mean necessarily have to lead with one of those mean one or the other is a more important at a given time but i think we as a party have to integrate dad abortion in any other issue just like we do everything else it is an important part of our platform is where most of our voters stand-in for the job public basically samson believes of us so i think that uh... you know we can spend resources and we can talk about how we have to do that and do it effectively i do i've done for the last thirty years margarine and that is really work hard to build an investing strong national este coalitions that's how we win elections it's working with the various pro-life coalitions to make sure that we register are voters we identify them we get them out to vote i would also as i've just said earlier called for eighteen-month victory plan that is succinct submitted april first in each of those states should have a significant component dealing with coalition building and development an addition as i have always done have an open door policy doll coalitions to sit down and talk with individuals work with them plan and strategize as we look to the two thousand twelve collections and winning elections then this is an area that we pay particular attention to not just with respect to the life issued by the whole host of issues that revolve around with maria reference to the coalition effort building up and establishing with the republican national committee a coalitions department with the specific charge of going out and building relationships on the ground with everyday activists across the country expanding the reach of the party expend invoice departing making sure that the party is represented and certainly there was no less true in our efforts with members of the pro-life community with whom i met several times are publicly and privately on a host of issues from health care to our statewide issues in on the state wide front here again is where the rubber meets the road having those relationship with the state legislative let level where the battle for marriage in the battle on the light questions are being engaged every single day having a relationship does not play off the federal level anymore tell state by state legislature by legislature and the party has an opportunity to engage with us that would state legislative leaders as we have over the last two years i've to help when these are important issues i believe too excited obviously something that can be very effective in the state we've work very well wisconsin right to life it's a great chapter obviously around the country i don't believe me they have non-partisan close tonight but i i think they should be getting known state legislators or federal office holders in the state wisconsin that are pro-life and uh... you know we work really well with the with the right to life i think it's an and viously paramount to our platform as republicans i think we have a responsibility as republicans to help promote on right-to-life issue and i think that we have a responsibility work with s_b_a_ it right to life and all of those groups in order to promote their platform and this is a coalition that's vitally important to our movement to a bit to the conservative movement and i would do everything i could to continue to promote uh... that coalition and be proud about the fact that we are pro-life we do believe that life begins at conception met the moment of conception every individuals in title to the freedoms on a declaration of independence in the forty two men of our constitution thank you might require that requested for the markets you due to come out with s_b_a_ uproariously of leading candidates send out there alum it's unfortunate if any body of the republican party level state or national id be discouraging our candidates from uh... holding their their pro-life values and views uh... out front i would certainly don't do that in missouri i think it's important that uh... at the right-to-life coalition and all collisions have a seat at the table to discuss everything from can get recruitment tick tick tick turn out to targeting all of the things that go into the messaging to win um... a good healthy election we did this in missouri whether it was i direct mail pieces regional radio we all superstar candidates to talk about their life issues and i think that it's not anything that party showdown hold back on any way shape or form and in fact unlabeled do nothing but growth our coalition in a four-star platform and our right to life organizations out there with the rest the eight workers state our national level should always as he did the table with us platforms panda recruitment are winning elections
