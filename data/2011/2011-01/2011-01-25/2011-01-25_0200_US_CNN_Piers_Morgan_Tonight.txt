20110125020011.000|20110125020013.000|TR0|PIERS MORGAN, HOST:  If there is one 
20110125020013.000|20110125020016.000|TR0|person who personifies this great city of 
20110125020016.000|20110125020018.000|TR0|New York, then surely it's Rudy Giuliani.  
20110125020018.000|20110125020020.000|TR0|He was born here in Brooklyn and on 9/11 
20110125020020.000|20110125020023.000|TR0|he became the global figurehead for that 
20110125020023.000|20110125020025.000|TR0|terrible disaster and the reemergence of 
20110125020025.000|20110125020027.000|TR0|the city in the aftermath.
20110125020027.000|20110125020030.000|TR0|
20110125020030.000|20110125020032.000|TR0|RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR:  What about 
20110125020032.000|20110125020034.000|TR0|Yankee Stadium? I just about lived there.  
20110125020034.000|20110125020037.000|TR0|It's my home away from home.
20110125020037.000|20110125020039.000|TR0|
20110125020039.000|20110125020041.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Rudy is a tough guy.  But tonight 
20110125020041.000|20110125020044.000|TR0|I've got tough questions for him.  Sarah 
20110125020044.000|20110125020046.000|TR0|Palin is too polarizing.  Would you be 
20110125020046.000|20110125020048.000|TR0|more tempted to run if she wasn't?
20110125020048.000|20110125020051.000|TR0|
20110125020051.000|20110125020053.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Piers Morgan, who does this guy 
20110125020053.000|20110125020055.000|TR0|think he is? David Frost?
20110125020055.000|20110125020058.000|TR0|
20110125020058.000|20110125020100.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I want to know this.  Is 
20110125020100.000|20110125020102.000|TR0|America's mayor getting ready to run for 
20110125020102.000|20110125020105.000|TR0|the White House?
20110125020105.000|20110125020107.000|TR0|
20110125020107.000|20110125020109.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110125020109.000|20110125020111.000|TR0|
20110125020111.000|20110125020114.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Rudy, welcome.  How are you?
20110125020114.000|20110125020116.000|TR0|
20110125020116.000|20110125020118.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Nice to be with you.
20110125020118.000|20110125020121.000|TR0|
20110125020121.000|20110125020123.000|TR0|MORGAN:  It seems to be no secret that 
20110125020123.000|20110125020125.000|TR0|you're going run again for the presidency. 
20110125020125.000|20110125020128.000|TR0| Obviously you're going to give me a 
20110125020128.000|20110125020130.000|TR0|normal answer.
20110125020130.000|20110125020132.000|TR0|
20110125020132.000|20110125020135.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Like nobody told me that yet.
20110125020135.000|20110125020137.000|TR0|
20110125020137.000|20110125020139.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I can't possibly comment, blah 
20110125020139.000|20110125020142.000|TR0|blah blah, working on the assumption that 
20110125020142.000|20110125020144.000|TR0|you may run again, and I'm assuming you 
20110125020144.000|20110125020146.000|TR0|will, how would you do things differently?
20110125020146.000|20110125020149.000|TR0|
20110125020149.000|20110125020151.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  You mean if I ran again, how 
20110125020151.000|20110125020153.000|TR0|would I do it differently? I would try to 
20110125020153.000|20110125020156.000|TR0|win.
20110125020156.000|20110125020158.000|TR0|
20110125020158.000|20110125020200.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I thought you were going to win 
20110125020200.000|20110125020203.000|TR0|when you ran before.
20110125020203.000|20110125020205.000|TR0|
20110125020205.000|20110125020207.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  For my benefit or benefit of 
20110125020207.000|20110125020210.000|TR0|anybody else running, I made a basic 
20110125020210.000|20110125020212.000|TR0|mistake.  The basic mistake was -- I made 
20110125020212.000|20110125020214.000|TR0|a lot of them, but I made one big one, 
20110125020214.000|20110125020216.000|TR0|which was I built a national campaign.  
20110125020216.000|20110125020219.000|TR0|When John McCain was ahead, we were kind 
20110125020219.000|20110125020221.000|TR0|of like trying to catch him.  We caught 
20110125020221.000|20110125020223.000|TR0|him and we went ahead of him.  So we were 
20110125020223.000|20110125020226.000|TR0|the front-runner for six months, five 
20110125020226.000|20110125020228.000|TR0|months, whatever.       But I didn't build 
20110125020228.000|20110125020230.000|TR0|a good enough campaign in any one state to 
20110125020230.000|20110125020233.000|TR0|win a primary.  I had a great national 
20110125020233.000|20110125020235.000|TR0|campaign, a terrible primary campaign.  
20110125020235.000|20110125020237.000|TR0|And it should be reversed.  You've got to 
20110125020237.000|20110125020240.000|TR0|win primaries in order to get nominated.  
20110125020240.000|20110125020242.000|TR0|So if I did it again, or for anybody else 
20110125020242.000|20110125020244.000|TR0|who is running, I would concentrate on 
20110125020244.000|20110125020247.000|TR0|figuring out how do you win Iowa? How do 
20110125020247.000|20110125020249.000|TR0|you win New Hampshire?  How do you win 
20110125020249.000|20110125020251.000|TR0|South Carolina?  How do you win Florida?  
20110125020251.000|20110125020254.000|TR0|In that order, at least one or two of 
20110125020254.000|20110125020256.000|TR0|those.  And we raised $57, $60 million.  I 
20110125020256.000|20110125020258.000|TR0|think we raised the most money of any 
20110125020258.000|20110125020301.000|TR0|candidate.
20110125020301.000|20110125020303.000|TR0|
20110125020303.000|20110125020305.000|TR0|MORGAN:  You were on this complete roller 
20110125020305.000|20110125020308.000|TR0|coaster.  I remember thinking Rudy is 
20110125020308.000|20110125020310.000|TR0|going to win.
20110125020310.000|20110125020312.000|TR0|
20110125020312.000|20110125020314.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  And it looked that way.
20110125020314.000|20110125020317.000|TR0|
20110125020317.000|20110125020319.000|TR0|MORGAN:  This time I would say to you, and 
20110125020319.000|20110125020321.000|TR0|it would be trickier, wouldn't it? You're 
20110125020321.000|20110125020324.000|TR0|not coming with quite the head of steam 
20110125020324.000|20110125020326.000|TR0|behind you.
20110125020326.000|20110125020328.000|TR0|
20110125020328.000|20110125020331.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Trickier.  Or maybe?
20110125020331.000|20110125020333.000|TR0|
20110125020333.000|20110125020335.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Or better?
20110125020335.000|20110125020338.000|TR0|
20110125020338.000|20110125020340.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It wouldn't be better.
20110125020340.000|20110125020342.000|TR0|
20110125020342.000|20110125020345.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Is it easier coming when you're 
20110125020345.000|20110125020347.000|TR0|not a favorite?
20110125020347.000|20110125020349.000|TR0|
20110125020349.000|20110125020352.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I think being the front-runner 
20110125020352.000|20110125020354.000|TR0|is tough.  The front- runners have won.  
20110125020354.000|20110125020356.000|TR0|But they've also lost.  I mean Hillary 
20110125020356.000|20110125020359.000|TR0|Clinton was the front-runner.  If you had 
20110125020359.000|20110125020401.000|TR0|looked at that campaign let's say in April 
20110125020401.000|20110125020403.000|TR0|or May of that primary season, you would 
20110125020403.000|20110125020406.000|TR0|have said that Hillary and I were going to 
20110125020406.000|20110125020408.000|TR0|be the candidates.  We were both knocked 
20110125020408.000|20110125020410.000|TR0|off.
20110125020410.000|20110125020413.000|TR0|
20110125020413.000|20110125020415.000|TR0|The next one, you probably would have 
20110125020415.000|20110125020417.000|TR0|assumed was Mitt Romney. And he didn't 
20110125020417.000|20110125020419.000|TR0|make it.  So it's hard to know.  I mean 
20110125020419.000|20110125020422.000|TR0|timing has a lot to do with it there is no 
20110125020422.000|20110125020424.000|TR0|obvious front-runner right now.  I guess 
20110125020424.000|20110125020426.000|TR0|everybody is happy with that because 
20110125020426.000|20110125020429.000|TR0|nobody wants to be the front- runner at 
20110125020429.000|20110125020431.000|TR0|this point because it always seems the 
20110125020431.000|20110125020433.000|TR0|front-runner gets all the attention, all 
20110125020433.000|20110125020436.000|TR0|the negative publicity.  And then give the 
20110125020436.000|20110125020438.000|TR0|president credit.  He has made the right 
20110125020438.000|20110125020440.000|TR0|decision.  I think he has a couple of 
20110125020440.000|20110125020443.000|TR0|problems that will remain, though.  What 
20110125020443.000|20110125020445.000|TR0|does he do about Obamacare?  The American 
20110125020445.000|20110125020447.000|TR0|people at least in a critical stage don't 
20110125020447.000|20110125020450.000|TR0|like it.
20110125020450.000|20110125020452.000|TR0|
20110125020452.000|20110125020454.000|TR0|MORGAN:  What would you do?  From what I 
20110125020454.000|20110125020457.000|TR0|was looking, I come from a country where 
20110125020457.000|20110125020459.000|TR0|we have the NHS, the National Health 
20110125020459.000|20110125020501.000|TR0|Service. Everyone is entitled to free 
20110125020501.000|20110125020504.000|TR0|health care in my country.
20110125020504.000|20110125020506.000|TR0|
20110125020506.000|20110125020508.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Right.
20110125020508.000|20110125020511.000|TR0|
20110125020511.000|20110125020513.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Here Obama brings in a new 
20110125020513.000|20110125020515.000|TR0|policy.  I'm being simplistic, but I think 
20110125020515.000|20110125020517.000|TR0|I need to be.  And from what I was looking 
20110125020517.000|20110125020520.000|TR0|at, 30 impoverished people are brought 
20110125020520.000|20110125020522.000|TR0|into a health care plan that weren't there 
20110125020522.000|20110125020524.000|TR0|before, and all he gets is kicked all over 
20110125020524.000|20110125020527.000|TR0|the place.  I find that rather baffling.   
20110125020527.000|20110125020529.000|TR0|    GIULIANI:  Here is why.  First of all, 
20110125020529.000|20110125020531.000|TR0|Americans have a great regard for private 
20110125020531.000|20110125020534.000|TR0|health care.  They feel that the reason 
20110125020534.000|20110125020536.000|TR0|they have the best health care system in 
20110125020536.000|20110125020538.000|TR0|the world is because it's the most private 
20110125020538.000|20110125020541.000|TR0|health care system in the world, less so 
20110125020541.000|20110125020543.000|TR0|than England, Canada. Americans say who 
20110125020543.000|20110125020545.000|TR0|goes to England for treatment? Who goes to 
20110125020545.000|20110125020548.000|TR0|Canada for treatment? People come to the 
20110125020548.000|20110125020550.000|TR0|United States when the prince of Saudi 
20110125020550.000|20110125020552.000|TR0|Arabia is in trouble.
20110125020552.000|20110125020555.000|TR0|
20110125020555.000|20110125020557.000|TR0|MORGAN:  That doesn't help people who can 
20110125020557.000|20110125020559.000|TR0|afford it.
20110125020559.000|20110125020602.000|TR0|
20110125020602.000|20110125020604.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It helps everybody because we 
20110125020604.000|20110125020606.000|TR0|have a law in the United States you have 
20110125020606.000|20110125020609.000|TR0|to care for people in emergency rooms.  I 
20110125020609.000|20110125020611.000|TR0|ran a hospital system, 17 hospitals, the 
20110125020611.000|20110125020613.000|TR0|New York Health and Hospitals Corporation. 
20110125020613.000|20110125020616.000|TR0| Not a single person in this city isn't 
20110125020616.000|20110125020618.000|TR0|cared for when they need help.  They get 
20110125020618.000|20110125020620.000|TR0|it in the emergency room.  But then they 
20110125020620.000|20110125020622.000|TR0|get the benefit of a health care system 
20110125020622.000|20110125020625.000|TR0|that is more advanced than any other 
20110125020625.000|20110125020627.000|TR0|health care system.  And we're afraid to 
20110125020627.000|20110125020629.000|TR0|lose that.
20110125020629.000|20110125020632.000|TR0|
20110125020632.000|20110125020634.000|TR0|Secondly, they didn't tell the truth about 
20110125020634.000|20110125020636.000|TR0|it.  The president is trying to convince 
20110125020636.000|20110125020639.000|TR0|us, and so are the Democrats, that this 
20110125020639.000|20110125020641.000|TR0|adding of 30 million more people is going 
20110125020641.000|20110125020643.000|TR0|to cost less money.  Of course that's 
20110125020643.000|20110125020646.000|TR0|absurd.  You can't add 30 million more 
20110125020646.000|20110125020648.000|TR0|people to the health care system and have 
20110125020648.000|20110125020650.000|TR0|it cost less money.
20110125020650.000|20110125020653.000|TR0|
20110125020653.000|20110125020655.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Isn't it worth paying more money?
20110125020655.000|20110125020657.000|TR0|
20110125020657.000|20110125020700.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Maybe.  But if you have that 
20110125020700.000|20110125020702.000|TR0|debate honestly, you don't lose as many 
20110125020702.000|20110125020704.000|TR0|people.  If you say to me it's going to 
20110125020704.000|20110125020707.000|TR0|cost X amount of money to cover 30 million 
20110125020707.000|20110125020709.000|TR0|people, I take a look at it and say can we 
20110125020709.000|20110125020711.000|TR0|afford that.
20110125020711.000|20110125020714.000|TR0|
20110125020714.000|20110125020716.000|TR0|MORGAN:  What is your view of Sarah Palin?
20110125020716.000|20110125020718.000|TR0|
20110125020718.000|20110125020720.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  My view of Sarah Palin is she 
20110125020720.000|20110125020723.000|TR0|is the most dynamic figure maybe in 
20110125020723.000|20110125020725.000|TR0|politics, even more in some ways than 
20110125020725.000|20110125020727.000|TR0|President Obama, who is a little more 
20110125020727.000|20110125020730.000|TR0|scripted than she is.  He is great with 
20110125020730.000|20110125020732.000|TR0|the teleprompter.
20110125020732.000|20110125020734.000|TR0|
20110125020734.000|20110125020737.000|TR0|MORGAN:  When you watch this bit of 
20110125020737.000|20110125020739.000|TR0|footage I want to show you here, which is 
20110125020739.000|20110125020741.000|TR0|Sarah Palin talking about the --
20110125020741.000|20110125020744.000|TR0|

20110125020748.000|20110125020751.000|TR0|SARAH PALIN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENTIAL 
20110125020751.000|20110125020753.000|TR0|CANDIDATE:  You're free to debate that 
20110125020753.000|20110125020755.000|TR0|vision.  If you don't like their ideas, 
20110125020755.000|20110125020758.000|TR0|you're free to propose better ideas.  But 
20110125020758.000|20110125020800.000|TR0|especially within hours of tragedy 
20110125020800.000|20110125020802.000|TR0|unfolding, journalists and pundits should 
20110125020802.000|20110125020805.000|TR0|not manufacture a blood libel that serves 
20110125020805.000|20110125020807.000|TR0|only to incite the very hatred and 
20110125020807.000|20110125020809.000|TR0|violence that purport to condemn.  That is 
20110125020809.000|20110125020812.000|TR0|reprehensible.
20110125020812.000|20110125020814.000|TR0|

20110125020819.000|20110125020821.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Is she right?
20110125020821.000|20110125020823.000|TR0|
20110125020823.000|20110125020825.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Except for the use of the word, 
20110125020825.000|20110125020828.000|TR0|absolutely right on.
20110125020828.000|20110125020830.000|TR0|
20110125020830.000|20110125020832.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Which word?
20110125020832.000|20110125020835.000|TR0|
20110125020835.000|20110125020837.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Blood libel.  A bad word to 
20110125020837.000|20110125020839.000|TR0|use.  A bad connotation going back to the 
20110125020839.000|20110125020842.000|TR0|whole history of anti-Semitism.  This 
20110125020842.000|20110125020844.000|TR0|wasn't at that level.  However to say that 
20110125020844.000|20110125020846.000|TR0|there was horribly ridiculous politically 
20110125020846.000|20110125020849.000|TR0|inspired attempt to blame her and the 
20110125020849.000|20110125020851.000|TR0|right wing for the shootings in Arizona is 
20110125020851.000|20110125020853.000|TR0|just factually correct.
20110125020853.000|20110125020856.000|TR0|
20110125020856.000|20110125020858.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I would say to a point.  I 
20110125020858.000|20110125020900.000|TR0|remember the sequence of events that day.  
20110125020900.000|20110125020903.000|TR0|What was interesting to me was she took 
20110125020903.000|20110125020905.000|TR0|that off her website as soon as this 
20110125020905.000|20110125020907.000|TR0|happened.  Why do you do that unless it's 
20110125020907.000|20110125020910.000|TR0|inherently, you think it's wrong?
20110125020910.000|20110125020912.000|TR0|
20110125020912.000|20110125020914.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Because you know what the media 
20110125020914.000|20110125020917.000|TR0|is going to do.  If you have lived the 
20110125020917.000|20110125020919.000|TR0|life she has lived for the last two years, 
20110125020919.000|20110125020921.000|TR0|and they pick on your children and they 
20110125020921.000|20110125020923.000|TR0|accuse your daughter of being accosted by 
20110125020923.000|20110125020926.000|TR0|A-Rod and all this crazy stuff.
20110125020926.000|20110125020928.000|TR0|
20110125020928.000|20110125020930.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Would you have ever done -- I 
20110125020930.000|20110125020933.000|TR0|don't know if you ever did -- but what you 
20110125020933.000|20110125020935.000|TR0|have ever done a website of your own which 
20110125020935.000|20110125020937.000|TR0|had crosshairs aimed at political targets?
20110125020937.000|20110125020940.000|TR0|
20110125020940.000|20110125020942.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Not if I had thought about it.  
20110125020942.000|20110125020944.000|TR0|But before that, the idea of having 
20110125020944.000|20110125020947.000|TR0|targets, you use targets, you're not 
20110125020947.000|20110125020949.000|TR0|necessarily suggesting shooting.  They use 
20110125020949.000|20110125020951.000|TR0|targets in football.  They use targets in 
20110125020951.000|20110125020954.000|TR0|all kinds of things.  So I don't think 
20110125020954.000|20110125020956.000|TR0|that's what she intended by it.
20110125020956.000|20110125020958.000|TR0|
20110125020958.000|20110125021001.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Given the furor, though, do you 
20110125021001.000|20110125021003.000|TR0|think it would now be prudent for 
20110125021003.000|20110125021005.000|TR0|politicians to not do that?
20110125021005.000|20110125021008.000|TR0|
20110125021008.000|20110125021010.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Of course it would.  But you 
20110125021010.000|20110125021012.000|TR0|learn these things in advance.
20110125021012.000|20110125021015.000|TR0|
20110125021015.000|20110125021017.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Is Sarah Palin too polarizing to 
20110125021017.000|20110125021019.000|TR0|win against Barack Obama?
20110125021019.000|20110125021022.000|TR0|
20110125021022.000|20110125021024.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  You know, it depends.  She's 
20110125021024.000|20110125021026.000|TR0|certainly not too polarizing to win a 
20110125021026.000|20110125021028.000|TR0|Republican primary.  She could win a 
20110125021028.000|20110125021031.000|TR0|Republican primary.
20110125021031.000|20110125021033.000|TR0|
20110125021033.000|20110125021035.000|TR0|MORGAN:  But against President Obama?
20110125021035.000|20110125021038.000|TR0|
20110125021038.000|20110125021040.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It depends on the job he does.
20110125021040.000|20110125021042.000|TR0|
20110125021042.000|20110125021045.000|TR0|MORGAN:  All the polls I see say in the 
20110125021045.000|20110125021047.000|TR0|key states she hasn't got a chance.
20110125021047.000|20110125021049.000|TR0|
20110125021049.000|20110125021052.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Right.
20110125021052.000|20110125021054.000|TR0|
20110125021054.000|20110125021056.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I agree with you.  She is 
20110125021056.000|20110125021059.000|TR0|incredibly dynamic.  She is very 
20110125021059.000|20110125021101.000|TR0|impressive at marketing her brand.  And 
20110125021101.000|20110125021103.000|TR0|she gets to the heartland of her vote 
20110125021103.000|20110125021106.000|TR0|very, very well in a way that I've rarely 
20110125021106.000|20110125021108.000|TR0|seen before in a politician.
20110125021108.000|20110125021110.000|TR0|
20110125021110.000|20110125021113.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  If we were look at the 1980 
20110125021113.000|20110125021115.000|TR0|presidential election, looking back on it, 
20110125021115.000|20110125021117.000|TR0|at this stage of that election, Ronald 
20110125021117.000|20110125021120.000|TR0|Reagan would have looked too polarizing to 
20110125021120.000|20110125021122.000|TR0|beat Jimmy Carter.  It would have looked 
20110125021122.000|20110125021124.000|TR0|like George Bush might be the candidate.  
20110125021124.000|20110125021126.000|TR0|Three or four other candidates, maybe 
20110125021126.000|20110125021129.000|TR0|Gerald Ford would run again.  Well, he 
20110125021129.000|20110125021131.000|TR0|turned out not to be too polarizing.  And 
20110125021131.000|20110125021133.000|TR0|part of it was because of Jimmy Carter. 
20110125021133.000|20110125021136.000|TR0|Jimmy Carter between now and --
20110125021136.000|20110125021138.000|TR0|
20110125021138.000|20110125021140.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Would you be more tempted to run 
20110125021140.000|20110125021143.000|TR0|if she wasn't?
20110125021143.000|20110125021145.000|TR0|
20110125021145.000|20110125021147.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Maybe the opposite.
20110125021147.000|20110125021150.000|TR0|
20110125021150.000|20110125021152.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Really?
20110125021152.000|20110125021154.000|TR0|
20110125021154.000|20110125021157.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Maybe the opposite because my 
20110125021157.000|20110125021159.000|TR0|one chance, if I have a chance, is that 
20110125021159.000|20110125021201.000|TR0|I'm considered a moderate Republican.
20110125021201.000|20110125021204.000|TR0|
20110125021204.000|20110125021206.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Yeah.  With the Tea Party 
20110125021206.000|20110125021208.000|TR0|grabbing so much attention and energizing 
20110125021208.000|20110125021211.000|TR0|so much of your base, is this going to be 
20110125021211.000|20110125021213.000|TR0|a disadvantage to you?  Are they going to 
20110125021213.000|20110125021215.000|TR0|hammer --
20110125021215.000|20110125021218.000|TR0|
20110125021218.000|20110125021220.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It's a strange thing, Piers.  
20110125021220.000|20110125021222.000|TR0|I'm probably the most fiscally 
20110125021222.000|20110125021225.000|TR0|conservative of the people that might run 
20110125021225.000|20110125021227.000|TR0|for president or who were running for 
20110125021227.000|20110125021229.000|TR0|president and played that out as mayor of 
20110125021229.000|20110125021231.000|TR0|New York City.  I'm probably one of the 
20110125021231.000|20110125021234.000|TR0|most conservative on foreign policy.  But 
20110125021234.000|20110125021236.000|TR0|I am a social moderate.  And it really 
20110125021236.000|20110125021238.000|TR0|depends on how important those issues are 
20110125021238.000|20110125021241.000|TR0|going to be this time.  It's not a benefit 
20110125021241.000|20110125021243.000|TR0|in the Republican Party.  It is a benefit 
20110125021243.000|20110125021245.000|TR0|in the general election.  It is not a 
20110125021245.000|20110125021248.000|TR0|benefit.  It's a liability in the 
20110125021248.000|20110125021250.000|TR0|Republican Party.
20110125021250.000|20110125021252.000|TR0|
20110125021252.000|20110125021255.000|TR0|And the question is are they going to be 
20110125021255.000|20110125021257.000|TR0|looking for someone that is a fiscal 
20110125021257.000|20110125021259.000|TR0|conservative and has proven to be a fiscal 
20110125021259.000|20110125021302.000|TR0|conservative. If the social issues become 
20110125021302.000|20110125021304.000|TR0|a big issue, then I wouldn't have a very 
20110125021304.000|20110125021306.000|TR0|good chance.  But I'm against abortion 
20110125021306.000|20110125021309.000|TR0|personally, but I think people should have 
20110125021309.000|20110125021311.000|TR0|the right to make that choice because I 
20110125021311.000|20110125021313.000|TR0|think it's a personal decision.  People 
20110125021313.000|20110125021316.000|TR0|disagree about that.
20110125021316.000|20110125021318.000|TR0|
20110125021318.000|20110125021320.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Do you agree on some of the 
20110125021320.000|20110125021323.000|TR0|outpourings of the Tea Party bordering on 
20110125021323.000|20110125021325.000|TR0|bigotry?
20110125021325.000|20110125021327.000|TR0|
20110125021327.000|20110125021329.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I find some of the outpourings 
20110125021329.000|20110125021332.000|TR0|of all of these movements bordering on 
20110125021332.000|20110125021334.000|TR0|extremist. It always happens.  You get a 
20110125021334.000|20110125021336.000|TR0|core --
20110125021336.000|20110125021339.000|TR0|
20110125021339.000|20110125021341.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Doesn't that inherently bring 
20110125021341.000|20110125021343.000|TR0|with it a danger?  Isn't that bad for 
20110125021343.000|20110125021346.000|TR0|American society?
20110125021346.000|20110125021348.000|TR0|
20110125021348.000|20110125021350.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Sure.  But the core of the 
20110125021350.000|20110125021353.000|TR0|movement is a good movement.  It's about, 
20110125021353.000|20110125021355.000|TR0|you know, it's about fiscal discipline.  
20110125021355.000|20110125021357.000|TR0|It's about -- you know what it's really 
20110125021357.000|20110125021400.000|TR0|about and why the emotion is there, it's 
20110125021400.000|20110125021402.000|TR0|about a feeling that the government is 
20110125021402.000|20110125021404.000|TR0|taking too many rights from me.
20110125021404.000|20110125021407.000|TR0|
20110125021407.000|20110125021409.000|TR0|MORGAN:  The Tea Party could easily split 
20110125021409.000|20110125021411.000|TR0|your vote against President Obama in the 
20110125021411.000|20110125021414.000|TR0|general election.  When that happens, it's 
20110125021414.000|20110125021416.000|TR0|all over for you guys.
20110125021416.000|20110125021418.000|TR0|
20110125021418.000|20110125021421.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Well, sure, sure.
20110125021421.000|20110125021423.000|TR0|
20110125021423.000|20110125021425.000|TR0|MORGAN:  He gets reelected.  So isn't 
20110125021425.000|20110125021428.000|TR0|there a real inherent danger?
20110125021428.000|20110125021430.000|TR0|
20110125021430.000|20110125021432.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  No, I don't think so.
20110125021432.000|20110125021434.000|TR0|
20110125021434.000|20110125021437.000|TR0|MORGAN:  In you guys encouraging the Tea 
20110125021437.000|20110125021439.000|TR0|Party to grow? Why are you creating two 
20110125021439.000|20110125021441.000|TR0|parties?
20110125021441.000|20110125021444.000|TR0|
20110125021444.000|20110125021446.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  No, I don't think so.  Let's go 
20110125021446.000|20110125021448.000|TR0|back three or four years ago when I was 
20110125021448.000|20110125021451.000|TR0|running.  There was a big anti-war 
20110125021451.000|20110125021453.000|TR0|movement in the country against the Iraq 
20110125021453.000|20110125021455.000|TR0|war.  People hanging President Bush in 
20110125021455.000|20110125021458.000|TR0|effigy, saying President Bush should be 
20110125021458.000|20110125021500.000|TR0|killed.  The core of the movement wasn't 
20110125021500.000|20110125021502.000|TR0|that.  The core of that movement 
20110125021502.000|20110125021505.000|TR0|legitimately opposed the war in Iraq.  I 
20110125021505.000|20110125021507.000|TR0|didn't agree with them.  But they had 
20110125021507.000|20110125021509.000|TR0|every right to do it.  They were very 
20110125021509.000|20110125021512.000|TR0|emotional.  They were very angry.  They 
20110125021512.000|20110125021514.000|TR0|were respectable people who opposed it 
20110125021514.000|20110125021516.000|TR0|with some extremists who made them look 
20110125021516.000|20110125021519.000|TR0|bad.  Tea Party same thing.  Respectable 
20110125021519.000|20110125021521.000|TR0|people, they have a legitimate political 
20110125021521.000|20110125021523.000|TR0|point, couple of people who are a little 
20110125021523.000|20110125021526.000|TR0|crazy who take it to an extreme.  
20110125021526.000|20110125021528.000|TR0|Basically, they help the Republican Party. 
20110125021528.000|20110125021530.000|TR0|And if they keep us on a strict focus on 
20110125021530.000|20110125021533.000|TR0|economic issues, they'll help us a lot.  
20110125021533.000|20110125021535.000|TR0|If they take us off on other issues, then 
20110125021535.000|20110125021537.000|TR0|you just don't know.  They could hurt us.
20110125021537.000|20110125021539.000|TR0|
20110125021539.000|20110125021542.000|TR0|MORGAN:  We're going to take a break.  
20110125021542.000|20110125021544.000|TR0|When we come back, tomorrow is the planned 
20110125021544.000|20110125021546.000|TR0|day for the State of the Union.  And I 
20110125021546.000|20110125021549.000|TR0|want to get your views on what you think 
20110125021549.000|20110125021551.000|TR0|the State of the Union really is.
20110125021551.000|20110125021553.000|TR0|
20110125021553.000|20110125021556.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110125021556.000|20110125021558.000|TR0|
20110125021558.000|20110125021600.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Rudy, President Obama's due to 
20110125021600.000|20110125021603.000|TR0|give the State of the Union tomorrow.  
20110125021603.000|20110125021605.000|TR0|What do you think the State of the Union 
20110125021605.000|20110125021607.000|TR0|is? If you were him, what would you be 
20110125021607.000|20110125021610.000|TR0|saying?
20110125021610.000|20110125021612.000|TR0|
20110125021612.000|20110125021614.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  If I were him, I would be 
20110125021614.000|20110125021617.000|TR0|saying the State of the Union is strong, 
20110125021617.000|20110125021619.000|TR0|which I do think it is.
20110125021619.000|20110125021621.000|TR0|
20110125021621.000|20110125021624.000|TR0|MORGAN:  What should he be saying?
20110125021624.000|20110125021626.000|TR0|
20110125021626.000|20110125021628.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  First of all he should be 
20110125021628.000|20110125021631.000|TR0|saying it's strong.  He should be talking 
20110125021631.000|20110125021633.000|TR0|about what he is going to do about the 
20110125021633.000|20110125021635.000|TR0|economic dislocation, the tremendous 
20110125021635.000|20110125021637.000|TR0|spending that goes on.  He's got to sound 
20110125021637.000|20110125021640.000|TR0|like a fiscal conservative without going 
20110125021640.000|20110125021642.000|TR0|too far.  President Clinton at his stage 
20110125021642.000|20110125021644.000|TR0|of the presidency I think this is when he 
20110125021644.000|20110125021647.000|TR0|delivered the State of the Union speech 
20110125021647.000|20110125021649.000|TR0|where he said the era of big government is 
20110125021649.000|20110125021651.000|TR0|over.  That just flipped the whole thing.  
20110125021651.000|20110125021654.000|TR0|All of the sudden Republicans, he had 
20110125021654.000|20110125021656.000|TR0|adopted the entire Republican agenda.
20110125021656.000|20110125021658.000|TR0|
20110125021658.000|20110125021701.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I can't see that.
20110125021701.000|20110125021703.000|TR0|
20110125021703.000|20110125021705.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  He's not going to do that.  I 
20110125021705.000|20110125021708.000|TR0|think he'll be more subtle.  I think there 
20110125021708.000|20110125021710.000|TR0|will be areas of agreement.  I think he'll 
20110125021710.000|20110125021712.000|TR0|talk about how he wants to reduce the 
20110125021712.000|20110125021715.000|TR0|deficit, but he is never going to embrace 
20110125021715.000|20110125021717.000|TR0|everything the Republicans want to do.  I 
20110125021717.000|20110125021719.000|TR0|think he'll defend Obamacare because that 
20110125021719.000|20110125021722.000|TR0|is his signature moment.  And how 
20110125021722.000|20110125021724.000|TR0|Obamacare plays out in the next years may 
20110125021724.000|20110125021726.000|TR0|very well determines if he gets reelected.
20110125021726.000|20110125021729.000|TR0|
20110125021729.000|20110125021731.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Would it, or will it really as 
20110125021731.000|20110125021733.000|TR0|always come down to the economy? Trillions 
20110125021733.000|20110125021736.000|TR0|of dollars in debt, won't it really depend 
20110125021736.000|20110125021738.000|TR0|on is it 10 percent job losses in two 
20110125021738.000|20110125021740.000|TR0|years' time, is it 14? Is it eight?
20110125021740.000|20110125021742.000|TR0|
20110125021742.000|20110125021745.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Yes.
20110125021745.000|20110125021747.000|TR0|
20110125021747.000|20110125021749.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I mean it seems to me when there 
20110125021749.000|20110125021752.000|TR0|are significant job losses in the country 
20110125021752.000|20110125021754.000|TR0|and unemployment is at that kind of level, 
20110125021754.000|20110125021756.000|TR0|that makes a hell of a difference.
20110125021756.000|20110125021759.000|TR0|
20110125021759.000|20110125021801.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  The reason I think Obamacare 
20110125021801.000|20110125021803.000|TR0|may continue to be a big issue, if you 
20110125021803.000|20110125021806.000|TR0|look at the key states, in those states, 
20110125021806.000|20110125021808.000|TR0|Obamacare is very, very unpopular.  Over 
20110125021808.000|20110125021810.000|TR0|the next year and a half, it's going to 
20110125021810.000|20110125021813.000|TR0|turn out to be more expensive than the 
20110125021813.000|20110125021815.000|TR0|president predicted, because one of the 
20110125021815.000|20110125021817.000|TR0|biggest mistakes he made in passing 
20110125021817.000|20110125021820.000|TR0|Obamacare is telling us we were going to 
20110125021820.000|20110125021822.000|TR0|save money.  This is absurd.  So what he 
20110125021822.000|20110125021824.000|TR0|is going to see are things playing out 
20110125021824.000|20110125021827.000|TR0|where it's going to cost more and more 
20110125021827.000|20110125021829.000|TR0|money.
20110125021829.000|20110125021831.000|TR0|
20110125021831.000|20110125021834.000|TR0|MORGAN:  How would you get the deficit 
20110125021834.000|20110125021836.000|TR0|down? Would you raise taxes?
20110125021836.000|20110125021838.000|TR0|
20110125021838.000|20110125021840.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Absolutely not.  What I would 
20110125021840.000|20110125021843.000|TR0|do --
20110125021843.000|20110125021845.000|TR0|
20110125021845.000|20110125021847.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Can you honestly say that?
20110125021847.000|20110125021850.000|TR0|
20110125021850.000|20110125021852.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Yes.  I actually did it.  When 
20110125021852.000|20110125021854.000|TR0|I became mayor of New York City, I had a 
20110125021854.000|20110125021857.000|TR0|$2.4 billion deficit.  And everybody 
20110125021857.000|20110125021859.000|TR0|wanted me to raise taxes.  I said if I 
20110125021859.000|20110125021901.000|TR0|raise taxes, I'll drive people out of New 
20110125021901.000|20110125021904.000|TR0|York City, and then I'll be raising taxes 
20110125021904.000|20110125021906.000|TR0|again.  So what I did was I cut expenses 
20110125021906.000|20110125021908.000|TR0|by 15 percent.  I cut everything but the 
20110125021908.000|20110125021911.000|TR0|police department, because I had too much 
20110125021911.000|20110125021913.000|TR0|crime.  I cut schools, very unpopular.  I 
20110125021913.000|20110125021915.000|TR0|cut every single thing, things that I 
20110125021915.000|20110125021918.000|TR0|thought were good, things that I thought 
20110125021918.000|20110125021920.000|TR0|were bad.  And he has got to cut federal 
20110125021920.000|20110125021922.000|TR0|spending to the level of realistic federal 
20110125021922.000|20110125021925.000|TR0|revenues.  And there is plenty of cutting 
20110125021925.000|20110125021927.000|TR0|to do.  He could cut 10, 15 percent.  And 
20110125021927.000|20110125021929.000|TR0|he's got to go into nondiscretionary 
20110125021929.000|20110125021932.000|TR0|spending, because it's out of control.
20110125021932.000|20110125021934.000|TR0|
20110125021934.000|20110125021936.000|TR0|MORGAN:  What is your view, I mean you 
20110125021936.000|20110125021939.000|TR0|took on Wall Street when you were the 
20110125021939.000|20110125021941.000|TR0|mayor.  You took on Wall Street when you 
20110125021941.000|20110125021943.000|TR0|were an attorney.  At the moment it seems 
20110125021943.000|20110125021945.000|TR0|to many people in America that the bankers 
20110125021945.000|20110125021948.000|TR0|having been bailed out with taxpayers' 
20110125021948.000|20110125021950.000|TR0|money, the first chance they've got, 
20110125021950.000|20110125021952.000|TR0|they've just got back in the trough and 
20110125021952.000|20110125021955.000|TR0|filled their snouts with millions of 
20110125021955.000|20110125021957.000|TR0|dollars of bonuses.
20110125021957.000|20110125021959.000|TR0|
20110125021959.000|20110125022002.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Well, I have to tell you, I 
20110125022002.000|20110125022004.000|TR0|have a different view of bonuses, as Mayor 
20110125022004.000|20110125022006.000|TR0|Bloomberg probably does.  Bonuses balance 
20110125022006.000|20110125022009.000|TR0|my budget in New York City.  The bigger 
20110125022009.000|20110125022011.000|TR0|the bonuses on Wall Street, the more money 
20110125022011.000|20110125022013.000|TR0|I had to spend on poor people.  The New 
20110125022013.000|20110125022016.000|TR0|York City budget is determined greatly by 
20110125022016.000|20110125022018.000|TR0|the bonuses given on Wall Street.
20110125022018.000|20110125022020.000|TR0|
20110125022020.000|20110125022023.000|TR0|MORGAN:  But is it as simple as that, 
20110125022023.000|20110125022025.000|TR0|really?
20110125022025.000|20110125022027.000|TR0|
20110125022027.000|20110125022030.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  We collect taxes.  Absolutely.  
20110125022030.000|20110125022032.000|TR0|We collect taxes on it.  It puts a lot of 
20110125022032.000|20110125022034.000|TR0|people to work.  The bigger a bonus that 
20110125022034.000|20110125022037.000|TR0|someone gets on Wall Street, the bigger 
20110125022037.000|20110125022039.000|TR0|present they buy, the more people that 
20110125022039.000|20110125022041.000|TR0|work in restaurants and hotels.
20110125022041.000|20110125022043.000|TR0|
20110125022043.000|20110125022046.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I get that argument.  But the 
20110125022046.000|20110125022048.000|TR0|problem with it is, it was the very 
20110125022048.000|20110125022050.000|TR0|bankers who brought this country to its 
20110125022050.000|20110125022053.000|TR0|knees.  The bonuses seem like a reward for 
20110125022053.000|20110125022055.000|TR0|failure.
20110125022055.000|20110125022057.000|TR0|
20110125022057.000|20110125022100.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  They're not.  People who 
20110125022100.000|20110125022102.000|TR0|brought them to their knees lost money, 
20110125022102.000|20110125022104.000|TR0|some of them have gone to jail.  The fact 
20110125022104.000|20110125022107.000|TR0|is when you have a society that creates 
20110125022107.000|20110125022109.000|TR0|great wealth, you have a society that has 
20110125022109.000|20110125022111.000|TR0|a tremendous amount of social mobility.
20110125022111.000|20110125022114.000|TR0|
20110125022114.000|20110125022116.000|TR0|America was the most capitalist country in 
20110125022116.000|20110125022118.000|TR0|the world for the last 100 years.  Is 
20110125022118.000|20110125022121.000|TR0|there any country in the world that has 
20110125022121.000|20110125022123.000|TR0|more social mobility than the United 
20110125022123.000|20110125022125.000|TR0|States? Is there any country that has 
20110125022125.000|20110125022128.000|TR0|brought more people out of poverty than 
20110125022128.000|20110125022130.000|TR0|the United States?  No.  And part of the 
20110125022130.000|20110125022132.000|TR0|reason for that is we retain our wealthy 
20110125022132.000|20110125022135.000|TR0|people.
20110125022135.000|20110125022137.000|TR0|
20110125022137.000|20110125022139.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Did you know Bernie Madoff?
20110125022139.000|20110125022142.000|TR0|
20110125022142.000|20110125022144.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I did not.  I didn't know 
20110125022144.000|20110125022146.000|TR0|Bernie Madoff.  My law firm was involved 
20110125022146.000|20110125022148.000|TR0|in representing one of the people in that 
20110125022148.000|20110125022151.000|TR0|case.  So I know it very, very well.
20110125022151.000|20110125022153.000|TR0|
20110125022153.000|20110125022155.000|TR0|MORGAN:  When you were mayor, you had no 
20110125022155.000|20110125022158.000|TR0|inkling of what he was up to?
20110125022158.000|20110125022200.000|TR0|
20110125022200.000|20110125022202.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  No.  It was very strange to me 
20110125022202.000|20110125022205.000|TR0|when it all came out was it two years ago 
20110125022205.000|20110125022207.000|TR0|now because I thought I knew everyone in 
20110125022207.000|20110125022209.000|TR0|New York.  And I thought I knew all the 
20110125022209.000|20110125022212.000|TR0|big players in New York, the good ones and 
20110125022212.000|20110125022214.000|TR0|the bad ones.  I never really heard of 
20110125022214.000|20110125022216.000|TR0|him.  I know some of his friends very 
20110125022216.000|20110125022219.000|TR0|well.  I know some of the people that lost 
20110125022219.000|20110125022221.000|TR0|millions and hundreds of millions of 
20110125022221.000|20110125022223.000|TR0|dollars with him.  I never knew Bernie 
20110125022223.000|20110125022226.000|TR0|Madoff.  I may have met him, but I never 
20110125022226.000|20110125022228.000|TR0|knew him.
20110125022228.000|20110125022230.000|TR0|
20110125022230.000|20110125022233.000|TR0|MORGAN:  When we come back, I want to talk 
20110125022233.000|20110125022235.000|TR0|to you about the war on terror, which 
20110125022235.000|20110125022237.000|TR0|aspects of it you think you're winning as 
20110125022237.000|20110125022240.000|TR0|a country, which aspects you maybe regret 
20110125022240.000|20110125022242.000|TR0|in terms of policies perceived by your 
20110125022242.000|20110125022244.000|TR0|party.
20110125022244.000|20110125022246.000|TR0|
20110125022246.000|20110125022249.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Absolutely.
20110125022249.000|20110125022251.000|TR0|

20110125022256.000|20110125022258.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Rudy, the war in Afghanistan 
20110125022258.000|20110125022300.000|TR0|isn't working, is it?
20110125022300.000|20110125022303.000|TR0|
20110125022303.000|20110125022305.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It hasn't come to the result we 
20110125022305.000|20110125022307.000|TR0|want yet.  I think we've made a lot of 
20110125022307.000|20110125022310.000|TR0|progress in the last year or so.  I think 
20110125022310.000|20110125022312.000|TR0|that we can win the war in Afghanistan if 
20110125022312.000|20110125022314.000|TR0|we stick with it.  We were at this point 
20110125022314.000|20110125022317.000|TR0|with Iraq also where a lot of people in 
20110125022317.000|20110125022319.000|TR0|this country were ready to pull out of 
20110125022319.000|20110125022321.000|TR0|Iraq before we had victory.
20110125022321.000|20110125022324.000|TR0|
20110125022324.000|20110125022326.000|TR0|MORGAN:  If I invite you back in 2015, do 
20110125022326.000|20110125022328.000|TR0|you honestly think that there will be any 
20110125022328.000|20110125022331.000|TR0|kind of tangible victory in Afghanistan?
20110125022331.000|20110125022333.000|TR0|
20110125022333.000|20110125022335.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I think there could be, yes.  I 
20110125022335.000|20110125022338.000|TR0|think that we could have a more stable 
20110125022338.000|20110125022340.000|TR0|government in Afghanistan.  I think we 
20110125022340.000|20110125022342.000|TR0|could have a tremendous destruction of the 
20110125022342.000|20110125022345.000|TR0|Taliban and al Qaeda.  That's really our 
20110125022345.000|20110125022347.000|TR0|objective in Afghanistan is somewhat 
20110125022347.000|20110125022349.000|TR0|different than Iraq.  In Iraq our 
20110125022349.000|20110125022351.000|TR0|objective was put a government together 
20110125022351.000|20110125022354.000|TR0|that can act as a stabilizing influence in 
20110125022354.000|20110125022356.000|TR0|that part of the world, and we're 
20110125022356.000|20110125022358.000|TR0|three-quarters of the way there.  In 
20110125022358.000|20110125022401.000|TR0|Afghanistan our objective always has been 
20110125022401.000|20110125022403.000|TR0|since President Bush went in and President 
20110125022403.000|20110125022405.000|TR0|Obama upped the stakes.  Let's see if we 
20110125022405.000|20110125022408.000|TR0|can destroy the Taliban or particularly al 
20110125022408.000|20110125022410.000|TR0|Qaeda.
20110125022410.000|20110125022412.000|TR0|
20110125022412.000|20110125022415.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Can you ever really get victory 
20110125022415.000|20110125022417.000|TR0|in these countries?
20110125022417.000|20110125022419.000|TR0|
20110125022419.000|20110125022422.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Sure, what constitutes a 
20110125022422.000|20110125022424.000|TR0|victory?  Look at Iraq.  Iraq is now a lot 
20110125022424.000|20110125022426.000|TR0|more peaceful.  Iraq has a government.  
20110125022426.000|20110125022429.000|TR0|Iraq is bringing some of the dissidents in 
20110125022429.000|20110125022431.000|TR0|and some of the extremists into the 
20110125022431.000|20110125022433.000|TR0|government now.  Iraq is trying --
20110125022433.000|20110125022436.000|TR0|
20110125022436.000|20110125022438.000|TR0|MORGAN:  When you say more peaceful, it's 
20110125022438.000|20110125022440.000|TR0|not more peaceful than it was before the 
20110125022440.000|20110125022443.000|TR0|war.
20110125022443.000|20110125022445.000|TR0|
20110125022445.000|20110125022447.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It's a lot more peaceful than 
20110125022447.000|20110125022449.000|TR0|it was before Saddam. When Saddam was 
20110125022449.000|20110125022452.000|TR0|there, it was a heck of a lot more violent.
20110125022452.000|20110125022454.000|TR0|
20110125022454.000|20110125022456.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I think that's a very arguable 
20110125022456.000|20110125022459.000|TR0|point.  There is still a lot of bloodshed 
20110125022459.000|20110125022501.000|TR0|in the streets of Baghdad.
20110125022501.000|20110125022503.000|TR0|
20110125022503.000|20110125022506.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Sure.
20110125022506.000|20110125022508.000|TR0|
20110125022508.000|20110125022510.000|TR0|MORGAN:  That's not what you would call a 
20110125022510.000|20110125022513.000|TR0|stable free democracy there.
20110125022513.000|20110125022515.000|TR0|
20110125022515.000|20110125022517.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It takes a while to have a 
20110125022517.000|20110125022520.000|TR0|stable free democracy. There is a 
20110125022520.000|20110125022522.000|TR0|democracy there.  In various parts of the 
20110125022522.000|20110125022524.000|TR0|country, it is much, much better.  You 
20110125022524.000|20110125022527.000|TR0|don't have the political prisoners that 
20110125022527.000|20110125022529.000|TR0|you had under Saddam Hussein.  You don't 
20110125022529.000|20110125022531.000|TR0|have the threat of a nuclear power being 
20110125022531.000|20110125022534.000|TR0|established there.  If Saddam were still 
20110125022534.000|20110125022536.000|TR0|there, with Iran becoming a nuclear power, 
20110125022536.000|20110125022538.000|TR0|Saddam would be matching that just like 
20110125022538.000|20110125022541.000|TR0|Pakistan and India played off each other 
20110125022541.000|20110125022543.000|TR0|in becoming nuclear powers. So we 
20110125022543.000|20110125022545.000|TR0|eliminate that problem immediately by him 
20110125022545.000|20110125022548.000|TR0|not being there.
20110125022548.000|20110125022550.000|TR0|
20110125022550.000|20110125022552.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Let's rewind to September 10th, 
20110125022552.000|20110125022554.000|TR0|2001.  If you were honest, would you have 
20110125022554.000|20110125022557.000|TR0|identified then as the major threat in 
20110125022557.000|20110125022559.000|TR0|terms of weapons of mass destruction? 
20110125022559.000|20110125022601.000|TR0|North Korea? Iran?  Or Iraq?
20110125022601.000|20110125022604.000|TR0|
20110125022604.000|20110125022606.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Probably all three.
20110125022606.000|20110125022608.000|TR0|
20110125022608.000|20110125022611.000|TR0|MORGAN:  But who would you in order? I 
20110125022611.000|20110125022613.000|TR0|mean from all I've been told, it was 
20110125022613.000|20110125022615.000|TR0|bleedingly obvious to people that Iran and 
20110125022615.000|20110125022618.000|TR0|North Korea clearly had better capability.
20110125022618.000|20110125022620.000|TR0|
20110125022620.000|20110125022622.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  No, no, that's in retrospect.  
20110125022622.000|20110125022625.000|TR0|Every single intelligence report, 
20110125022625.000|20110125022627.000|TR0|including the ones that went to the UK, 
20110125022627.000|20110125022629.000|TR0|United States, Germany said that Saddam 
20110125022629.000|20110125022632.000|TR0|had weapons of mass destruction.
20110125022632.000|20110125022634.000|TR0|
20110125022634.000|20110125022636.000|TR0|MORGAN:  But it was wrong, that 
20110125022636.000|20110125022639.000|TR0|intelligence.
20110125022639.000|20110125022641.000|TR0|
20110125022641.000|20110125022643.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It was all wrong, but every bit 
20110125022643.000|20110125022646.000|TR0|of it said it.  If you had asked me on 
20110125022646.000|20110125022648.000|TR0|September 10th, does Saddam Hussein have 
20110125022648.000|20110125022650.000|TR0|nuclear weapons, and I called up President 
20110125022650.000|20110125022652.000|TR0|Clinton who was then out of office and 
20110125022652.000|20110125022655.000|TR0|asked him, he would have told me yes.
20110125022655.000|20110125022657.000|TR0|
20110125022657.000|20110125022659.000|TR0|If I called up President Bush he would 
20110125022659.000|20110125022702.000|TR0|have told me yes.  If I called up Tony 
20110125022702.000|20110125022704.000|TR0|Blair, he would have told me yes.  If I 
20110125022704.000|20110125022706.000|TR0|talked to the FBI or the CIA, they would 
20110125022706.000|20110125022709.000|TR0|have told me yes.  So I would have 
20110125022709.000|20110125022711.000|TR0|believed that he had weapons of mass 
20110125022711.000|20110125022713.000|TR0|destruction, just like everybody else.     
20110125022713.000|20110125022716.000|TR0|  MORGAN:  But it would be a mistake, 
20110125022716.000|20110125022718.000|TR0|wouldn't it, to invade Iran now?
20110125022718.000|20110125022720.000|TR0|
20110125022720.000|20110125022723.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Would it be a mistake to invade 
20110125022723.000|20110125022725.000|TR0|Iran right now?
20110125022725.000|20110125022727.000|TR0|
20110125022727.000|20110125022730.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Using the same yardstick of 
20110125022730.000|20110125022732.000|TR0|argument that you used with Saddam Hussein?
20110125022732.000|20110125022734.000|TR0|
20110125022734.000|20110125022737.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I think it would be a mistake 
20110125022737.000|20110125022739.000|TR0|right now to invade Iran.  But I don't 
20110125022739.000|20110125022741.000|TR0|think it would be a mistake --
20110125022741.000|20110125022744.000|TR0|
20110125022744.000|20110125022746.000|TR0|MORGAN:  And I'm assuming North Korea 
20110125022746.000|20110125022748.000|TR0|presumably?
20110125022748.000|20110125022751.000|TR0|
20110125022751.000|20110125022753.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  North Korea is a different 
20110125022753.000|20110125022755.000|TR0|situation which we can talk about 
20110125022755.000|20110125022757.000|TR0|different things involving North Korea.  
20110125022757.000|20110125022800.000|TR0|Iran should, however, feel that if they do 
20110125022800.000|20110125022802.000|TR0|become a nuclear power, we might very well 
20110125022802.000|20110125022804.000|TR0|take military action if they become a 
20110125022804.000|20110125022807.000|TR0|nuclear power.  It's the only way in which 
20110125022807.000|20110125022809.000|TR0|we're going to gain leverage over them in 
20110125022809.000|20110125022811.000|TR0|order to get them to be more reasonable 
20110125022811.000|20110125022814.000|TR0|about inspections.  I think the fact that 
20110125022814.000|20110125022816.000|TR0|they think that we will not take military 
20110125022816.000|20110125022818.000|TR0|action makes them a lot bolder.
20110125022818.000|20110125022821.000|TR0|
20110125022821.000|20110125022823.000|TR0|MORGAN:  You recently went to Paris with 
20110125022823.000|20110125022825.000|TR0|several other Republicans.
20110125022825.000|20110125022828.000|TR0|
20110125022828.000|20110125022830.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Right.
20110125022830.000|20110125022832.000|TR0|
20110125022832.000|20110125022835.000|TR0|MORGAN:  And you talked with an Iranian 
20110125022835.000|20110125022837.000|TR0|opposition group called Mujahedeen 
20110125022837.000|20110125022839.000|TR0|e-Khalq.  And you got some flak for that.
20110125022839.000|20110125022842.000|TR0|
20110125022842.000|20110125022844.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I did.
20110125022844.000|20110125022846.000|TR0|
20110125022846.000|20110125022849.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I don't think I would give you 
20110125022849.000|20110125022851.000|TR0|flak for that, because I saw the benefit 
20110125022851.000|20110125022853.000|TR0|of the Blair government talking directly 
20110125022853.000|20110125022855.000|TR0|to the IRA. And it led to peace and 
20110125022855.000|20110125022858.000|TR0|prosperity.  I saw it happen.  Not 
20110125022858.000|20110125022900.000|TR0|perfect, but certainly better than what 
20110125022900.000|20110125022902.000|TR0|was going on before.  Do you believe 
20110125022902.000|20110125022905.000|TR0|fundamentally that America should be doing 
20110125022905.000|20110125022907.000|TR0|more of these trips?
20110125022907.000|20110125022909.000|TR0|
20110125022909.000|20110125022912.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Absolutely, absolutely.  And 
20110125022912.000|20110125022914.000|TR0|the group that sent us there is a group 
20110125022914.000|20110125022916.000|TR0|that supports lifting the sanction against 
20110125022916.000|20110125022919.000|TR0|them that was placed on by the Clinton 
20110125022919.000|20110125022921.000|TR0|administration describing them as a 
20110125022921.000|20110125022923.000|TR0|terrorist group.  That sanction has been 
20110125022923.000|20110125022926.000|TR0|lifted by the UK.  That sanction has been 
20110125022926.000|20110125022928.000|TR0|lifted by the European Union.  Basically, 
20110125022928.000|20110125022930.000|TR0|they're considered a terrorist group 
20110125022930.000|20110125022933.000|TR0|because they oppose Ahmadinejad and they 
20110125022933.000|20110125022935.000|TR0|oppose the mullahs.  And the only two 
20110125022935.000|20110125022937.000|TR0|countries that now list them that way are 
20110125022937.000|20110125022940.000|TR0|Iran and the United States.
20110125022940.000|20110125022942.000|TR0|
20110125022942.000|20110125022944.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Would you meet with Hezbollah, 
20110125022944.000|20110125022947.000|TR0|with al Qaeda?
20110125022947.000|20110125022949.000|TR0|
20110125022949.000|20110125022951.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It would depend on what could 
20110125022951.000|20110125022954.000|TR0|be accomplished.  What I believe in is the 
20110125022954.000|20110125022956.000|TR0|old-fashioned diplomacy that used to 
20110125022956.000|20110125022958.000|TR0|exist, which is when a president or a 
20110125022958.000|20110125023000.000|TR0|mayor or a governor goes into a 
20110125023000.000|20110125023003.000|TR0|negotiating session, you've got to have a 
20110125023003.000|20110125023005.000|TR0|group of objectives that you think you can 
20110125023005.000|20110125023007.000|TR0|obtain from it.  And you have to have 
20110125023007.000|20110125023010.000|TR0|leverage.
20110125023010.000|20110125023012.000|TR0|
20110125023012.000|20110125023014.000|TR0|MORGAN:  But as a principle --
20110125023014.000|20110125023017.000|TR0|
20110125023017.000|20110125023019.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I wouldn't just meet for the 
20110125023019.000|20110125023021.000|TR0|purpose of meeting.
20110125023021.000|20110125023024.000|TR0|
20110125023024.000|20110125023026.000|TR0|MORGAN:  But as a principle, you believe 
20110125023026.000|20110125023028.000|TR0|it is probably time that America talked 
20110125023028.000|20110125023031.000|TR0|more to its enemies?
20110125023031.000|20110125023033.000|TR0|
20110125023033.000|20110125023035.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  If America has the objective of 
20110125023035.000|20110125023038.000|TR0|obtaining advantages from it.  Like to 
20110125023038.000|20110125023040.000|TR0|talk to Iran is useless unless you have 
20110125023040.000|20110125023042.000|TR0|leverage. That leverage could be created 
20110125023042.000|20110125023045.000|TR0|by Iran truly believing that we would take 
20110125023045.000|20110125023047.000|TR0|military action if we had to do that.  I 
20110125023047.000|20110125023049.000|TR0|grew up in the Reagan administration.  
20110125023049.000|20110125023052.000|TR0|Reagan spoke to the Soviet Union.  He 
20110125023052.000|20110125023054.000|TR0|spoke to our enemies.  But he also pointed 
20110125023054.000|20110125023056.000|TR0|missiles at their major cities when he did 
20110125023056.000|20110125023059.000|TR0|it.  And he insisted on nuclear defense.  
20110125023059.000|20110125023101.000|TR0|And he raised the leverage against them.  
20110125023101.000|20110125023103.000|TR0|If you know how to do it, then it is 
20110125023103.000|20110125023105.000|TR0|appropriate to talk to our enemies.  But 
20110125023105.000|20110125023108.000|TR0|if you're begging them to talk to you, as 
20110125023108.000|20110125023110.000|TR0|happened in some cases in the early part 
20110125023110.000|20110125023112.000|TR0|of this administration, you're never going 
20110125023112.000|20110125023115.000|TR0|to get anywhere.
20110125023115.000|20110125023117.000|TR0|
20110125023117.000|20110125023119.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Would you meet this group again?
20110125023119.000|20110125023122.000|TR0|
20110125023122.000|20110125023124.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Absolutely.  This group -- this 
20110125023124.000|20110125023126.000|TR0|group is a hope for Iran.  This is a group 
20110125023126.000|20110125023129.000|TR0|that 100 members of Congress have 
20110125023129.000|20110125023131.000|TR0|petitioned the State Department to have it 
20110125023131.000|20110125023133.000|TR0|delisted so that it can raise money in the 
20110125023133.000|20110125023136.000|TR0|United States.  The only two countries in 
20110125023136.000|20110125023138.000|TR0|the world that refuse to deal with this 
20110125023138.000|20110125023140.000|TR0|group are Iran and the United States.  
20110125023140.000|20110125023143.000|TR0|What are we doing on the same side of 
20110125023143.000|20110125023145.000|TR0|Iran? We should be on the side of the UK 
20110125023145.000|20110125023147.000|TR0|and the European Union.
20110125023147.000|20110125023150.000|TR0|
20110125023150.000|20110125023152.000|TR0|MORGAN:  It's a good time for America and 
20110125023152.000|20110125023154.000|TR0|Russia to be doing deals to reduce their 
20110125023154.000|20110125023157.000|TR0|nuclear capability, given that both 
20110125023157.000|20110125023159.000|TR0|countries are relatively stable compared 
20110125023159.000|20110125023201.000|TR0|to a lot of other countries.  Given that 
20110125023201.000|20110125023203.000|TR0|Pakistan and countries like that are 
20110125023203.000|20110125023206.000|TR0|clearly unstable and in possession of a 
20110125023206.000|20110125023208.000|TR0|number of weapons, is this really the 
20110125023208.000|20110125023210.000|TR0|right time for America to be downgrading?
20110125023210.000|20110125023213.000|TR0|
20110125023213.000|20110125023215.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I didn't think so.  I mean I 
20110125023215.000|20110125023217.000|TR0|didn't think that the START treaty made 
20110125023217.000|20110125023220.000|TR0|sense right now.  Particularly I didn't 
20110125023220.000|20110125023222.000|TR0|see it as a good time to do it as a reward 
20110125023222.000|20110125023224.000|TR0|for Putin's actions in which Putin has 
20110125023224.000|20110125023227.000|TR0|gone way, way back and retrogressed in 
20110125023227.000|20110125023229.000|TR0|Russia.  It almost feels somewhat like a 
20110125023229.000|20110125023231.000|TR0|Soviet Union now.  So I didn't think this 
20110125023231.000|20110125023234.000|TR0|was the right time to do that.  I don't 
20110125023234.000|20110125023236.000|TR0|think the treaty means all that much in 
20110125023236.000|20110125023238.000|TR0|terms of our ability to defend ourselves 
20110125023238.000|20110125023241.000|TR0|or their ability to harm us.  But I 
20110125023241.000|20110125023243.000|TR0|thought symbolically this wasn't the right 
20110125023243.000|20110125023245.000|TR0|time.  I thought it wasn't also a good 
20110125023245.000|20110125023248.000|TR0|idea to give up the nuclear defense of 
20110125023248.000|20110125023250.000|TR0|Poland and the Czech Republic as part of 
20110125023250.000|20110125023252.000|TR0|it.  I don't think we got enough back in 
20110125023252.000|20110125023255.000|TR0|return.
20110125023255.000|20110125023257.000|TR0|
20110125023257.000|20110125023259.000|TR0|MORGAN:  We're going to come back in a 
20110125023259.000|20110125023302.000|TR0|minute and talk about the events of 9/11.  
20110125023302.000|20110125023304.000|TR0|We're approaching the 10th anniversary.  
20110125023304.000|20110125023306.000|TR0|You were a key figurehead on that terrible 
20110125023306.000|20110125023308.000|TR0|day, and I want to talk to you about your 
20110125023308.000|20110125023311.000|TR0|recollection.
20110125023311.000|20110125023313.000|TR0|
20110125023313.000|20110125023315.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110125023315.000|20110125023318.000|TR0|
20110125023318.000|20110125023320.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Rudy, this year will be the tenth 
20110125023320.000|20110125023322.000|TR0|anniversary of 9/11. You were obviously a 
20110125023322.000|20110125023325.000|TR0|pivotal figure that day.  Is America as 
20110125023325.000|20110125023327.000|TR0|susceptible now to another attack like 
20110125023327.000|20110125023329.000|TR0|that as it was then, do you think?       
20110125023329.000|20110125023332.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Probably less, for the simple 
20110125023332.000|20110125023334.000|TR0|fact that they're looking for it more.  We 
20110125023334.000|20110125023336.000|TR0|have intercepted several of them, more 
20110125023336.000|20110125023339.000|TR0|than several.  There are about four or 
20110125023339.000|20110125023341.000|TR0|five that are public.  There are probably 
20110125023341.000|20110125023343.000|TR0|another 20 or 30 that we don't even know 
20110125023343.000|20110125023346.000|TR0|about.  I'm guessing at that.
20110125023346.000|20110125023348.000|TR0|
20110125023348.000|20110125023350.000|TR0|So we have better intelligence capability. 
20110125023350.000|20110125023353.000|TR0| We have better cooperation among 
20110125023353.000|20110125023355.000|TR0|intelligence services here, Europe, all 
20110125023355.000|20110125023357.000|TR0|over the world.  We have picked up plots, 
20110125023357.000|20110125023400.000|TR0|picked up plots in the UK, in Germany.  
20110125023400.000|20110125023402.000|TR0|But I think we have a much better system 
20110125023402.000|20110125023404.000|TR0|than we had back then.
20110125023404.000|20110125023406.000|TR0|
20110125023406.000|20110125023409.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Are you surprised, in a good way, 
20110125023409.000|20110125023411.000|TR0|that there hasn't been another huge attack 
20110125023411.000|20110125023413.000|TR0|on American mainland in the last decade?
20110125023413.000|20110125023416.000|TR0|
20110125023416.000|20110125023418.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Very surprised.  If you had 
20110125023418.000|20110125023420.000|TR0|asked me on September 11th, 12th, 13th, 
20110125023420.000|20110125023423.000|TR0|14th, the days after that, I would have 
20110125023423.000|20110125023425.000|TR0|told you there is no chance we're not 
20110125023425.000|20110125023427.000|TR0|going to be attacked numerous times, all 
20110125023427.000|20110125023430.000|TR0|different kinds of attacks.  I wasn't just 
20110125023430.000|20110125023432.000|TR0|guessing that.  That's what I was being 
20110125023432.000|20110125023434.000|TR0|told by responsibility intelligence 
20110125023434.000|20110125023437.000|TR0|services.
20110125023437.000|20110125023439.000|TR0|
20110125023439.000|20110125023441.000|TR0|I think it's a combination of having taken 
20110125023441.000|20110125023444.000|TR0|very, very strong action, and continuing 
20110125023444.000|20110125023446.000|TR0|to take strong action.  I also think it is 
20110125023446.000|20110125023448.000|TR0|they want to exceed the impact that they 
20110125023448.000|20110125023451.000|TR0|had with September 11th.  And therefore 
20110125023451.000|20110125023453.000|TR0|they haven't done a lot of the small 
20110125023453.000|20110125023455.000|TR0|attacks, which I think we're very 
20110125023455.000|20110125023458.000|TR0|fortunate that they decided to do that.  
20110125023458.000|20110125023500.000|TR0|And we've had some time now to prepare 
20110125023500.000|20110125023502.000|TR0|ourselves for all the things that they can 
20110125023502.000|20110125023505.000|TR0|do.
20110125023505.000|20110125023507.000|TR0|
20110125023507.000|20110125023509.000|TR0|MORGAN:  On that day, you were having 
20110125023509.000|20110125023511.000|TR0|breakfast at the Peninsula Hotel here in 
20110125023511.000|20110125023514.000|TR0|Manhattan.  How did you hear what had 
20110125023514.000|20110125023516.000|TR0|happened?
20110125023516.000|20110125023518.000|TR0|
20110125023518.000|20110125023521.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  One of the police officers that 
20110125023521.000|20110125023523.000|TR0|was with me came up to my counsel, Denny 
20110125023523.000|20110125023525.000|TR0|Young, who was having breakfast with me, 
20110125023525.000|20110125023528.000|TR0|and Bill Simon was the third person.  
20110125023528.000|20110125023530.000|TR0|Whispered in his ear.  Denny came over to 
20110125023530.000|20110125023532.000|TR0|me -- got up from the breakfast table and 
20110125023532.000|20110125023535.000|TR0|said there is a terrible fire at the Twin 
20110125023535.000|20110125023537.000|TR0|Towers.  A twin engine plane they think 
20110125023537.000|20110125023539.000|TR0|has hit the North Tower.  We better get 
20110125023539.000|20110125023542.000|TR0|down there right away.
20110125023542.000|20110125023544.000|TR0|
20110125023544.000|20110125023546.000|TR0|So when we first heard it, we didn't 
20110125023546.000|20110125023549.000|TR0|realize it was a terrorist attack or how 
20110125023549.000|20110125023551.000|TR0|bad it was.  When I walked out into the 
20110125023551.000|20110125023553.000|TR0|street on 55th street, and I looked up 
20110125023553.000|20110125023556.000|TR0|into the sky, it was the most beautiful 
20110125023556.000|20110125023558.000|TR0|day, clear sky, not a cloud in the sky.  
20110125023558.000|20110125023600.000|TR0|The first reaction I had was it could not 
20110125023600.000|20110125023603.000|TR0|be an accident.  This has to be a 
20110125023603.000|20110125023605.000|TR0|deliberate situation.  A plane would not 
20110125023605.000|20110125023607.000|TR0|have gotten off course and just smashed in.
20110125023607.000|20110125023609.000|TR0|
20110125023609.000|20110125023612.000|TR0|MORGAN:  You thought that from the very 
20110125023612.000|20110125023614.000|TR0|first.
20110125023614.000|20110125023616.000|TR0|
20110125023616.000|20110125023619.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I did.  But I didn't think 
20110125023619.000|20110125023621.000|TR0|terrorism necessarily.  I thought maybe it 
20110125023621.000|20110125023623.000|TR0|was a crazy person like the person that 
20110125023623.000|20110125023626.000|TR0|we're dealing with in Arizona, a person 
20110125023626.000|20110125023628.000|TR0|who has their own mental issues that had 
20110125023628.000|20110125023630.000|TR0|nothing to do with politics.  So we rushed 
20110125023630.000|20110125023633.000|TR0|down there.  And then the second attack 
20110125023633.000|20110125023635.000|TR0|took place.  I was about a mile away when 
20110125023635.000|20110125023637.000|TR0|the second attack took place.
20110125023637.000|20110125023640.000|TR0|
20110125023640.000|20110125023642.000|TR0|MORGAN:  You're the mayor of New York.  
20110125023642.000|20110125023644.000|TR0|What are you now thinking?       GIULIANI: 
20110125023644.000|20110125023647.000|TR0| I'm thinking how do I get air support for 
20110125023647.000|20110125023649.000|TR0|the city. We better get planes up in the 
20110125023649.000|20110125023651.000|TR0|air.  I don't have an Air Force.  We have 
20110125023651.000|20110125023654.000|TR0|to get the Defense Department, the 
20110125023654.000|20110125023656.000|TR0|president on the phone.  So I reached Vice 
20110125023656.000|20110125023658.000|TR0|President Cheney eventually.  Actually, I 
20110125023658.000|20110125023701.000|TR0|didn't reach Vice President Cheney, the 
20110125023701.000|20110125023703.000|TR0|phone got cut off because the first 
20110125023703.000|20110125023705.000|TR0|building came down, amazing.
20110125023705.000|20110125023708.000|TR0|
20110125023708.000|20110125023710.000|TR0|I called the police commissioner.  I 
20110125023710.000|20110125023712.000|TR0|called the fire commissioner.  I made sure 
20110125023712.000|20110125023714.000|TR0|we had our people in place.  We 
20110125023714.000|20110125023717.000|TR0|immediately started to think about how do 
20110125023717.000|20110125023719.000|TR0|we do the rescue effectively.  At the same 
20110125023719.000|20110125023721.000|TR0|time, how do we protect the rest of the 
20110125023721.000|20110125023724.000|TR0|city.  Because, as I said, from the first 
20110125023724.000|20110125023726.000|TR0|moment I knew it was a terrorist attack, I 
20110125023726.000|20110125023728.000|TR0|assumed --
20110125023728.000|20110125023731.000|TR0|
20110125023731.000|20110125023733.000|TR0|MORGAN:  How do you control emotion in 
20110125023733.000|20110125023735.000|TR0|that moment?  You're a New Yorker.  You 
20110125023735.000|20110125023738.000|TR0|were born in Brooklyn.  You're watching 
20110125023738.000|20110125023740.000|TR0|the Twin Towers come down.  You're 
20110125023740.000|20110125023742.000|TR0|watching thousands of people -- you don't 
20110125023742.000|20110125023745.000|TR0|know how many dying.  And yet you've got 
20110125023745.000|20110125023747.000|TR0|to show calm and you've got to show 
20110125023747.000|20110125023749.000|TR0|leadership.  And inside you must be 
20110125023749.000|20110125023752.000|TR0|turmoil.
20110125023752.000|20110125023754.000|TR0|
20110125023754.000|20110125023756.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I think I remember how I did 
20110125023756.000|20110125023759.000|TR0|it.  The first time I got emotional -- the 
20110125023759.000|20110125023801.000|TR0|first time I realized how terrible it was, 
20110125023801.000|20110125023803.000|TR0|how bad it was, I was right below the 
20110125023803.000|20110125023806.000|TR0|North Tower.  Police were telling me to 
20110125023806.000|20110125023808.000|TR0|look up because things were falling down 
20110125023808.000|20110125023810.000|TR0|and they were afraid it was going to hit 
20110125023810.000|20110125023812.000|TR0|us.  And I realized that it wasn't things 
20110125023812.000|20110125023815.000|TR0|falling down, it was a man throwing 
20110125023815.000|20110125023817.000|TR0|himself out of the 101st floor.
20110125023817.000|20110125023819.000|TR0|
20110125023819.000|20110125023822.000|TR0|My emotions, I can't tell you what they 
20110125023822.000|20110125023824.000|TR0|were.  I just froze.  I said to myself, 
20110125023824.000|20110125023826.000|TR0|this is the worst thing I have ever seen.  
20110125023826.000|20110125023829.000|TR0|This is the worst situation I'm ever going 
20110125023829.000|20110125023831.000|TR0|to face.  And then I said to myself, I 
20110125023831.000|20110125023833.000|TR0|can't think about that right now.  All I 
20110125023833.000|20110125023836.000|TR0|can think about is what is the most 
20110125023836.000|20110125023838.000|TR0|effective way to handle it.  What is the 
20110125023838.000|20110125023840.000|TR0|safest thing to do to help these people?  
20110125023840.000|20110125023843.000|TR0|Let me just focus on my job, the next step 
20110125023843.000|20110125023845.000|TR0|ahead.
20110125023845.000|20110125023847.000|TR0|
20110125023847.000|20110125023850.000|TR0|MORGAN:  At one of the initial press 
20110125023850.000|20110125023852.000|TR0|conferences you were asked about the death 
20110125023852.000|20110125023854.000|TR0|toll.  And I want to play you a bit of 
20110125023854.000|20110125023857.000|TR0|footage of what you said.
20110125023857.000|20110125023859.000|TR0|

20110125023901.000|20110125023904.000|TR0|
20110125023904.000|20110125023906.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  The number of casualties will 
20110125023906.000|20110125023908.000|TR0|be more than any -- any of us can bear 
20110125023908.000|20110125023911.000|TR0|ultimately.  And I don't think we want to 
20110125023911.000|20110125023913.000|TR0|speculate on the number of casualties.  
20110125023913.000|20110125023915.000|TR0|The effort now has to be to save as many 
20110125023915.000|20110125023917.000|TR0|people as possible.
20110125023917.000|20110125023920.000|TR0|
20110125023920.000|20110125023922.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110125023922.000|20110125023924.000|TR0|
20110125023924.000|20110125023927.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Why did you say that?
20110125023927.000|20110125023929.000|TR0|
20110125023929.000|20110125023931.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I thought if I said a number 
20110125023931.000|20110125023934.000|TR0|like 12,000, it would -- it would just 
20110125023934.000|20110125023936.000|TR0|create even more fear, more shock, 
20110125023936.000|20110125023938.000|TR0|possibly even panic. And I wasn't sure it 
20110125023938.000|20110125023941.000|TR0|was correct.  Intuitively, it seemed like 
20110125023941.000|20110125023943.000|TR0|the number was high.  But who the heck 
20110125023943.000|20110125023945.000|TR0|knew?  I didn't know.  So I thought that 
20110125023945.000|20110125023948.000|TR0|was the best thing to do.       MORGAN:  
20110125023948.000|20110125023950.000|TR0|If you had been President Bush, would you 
20110125023950.000|20110125023952.000|TR0|have ignored all the advice not to come 
20110125023952.000|20110125023955.000|TR0|back and just come back to New York, do 
20110125023955.000|20110125023957.000|TR0|you think?  If you had been the president?
20110125023957.000|20110125023959.000|TR0|
20110125023959.000|20110125024002.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Being the president is very 
20110125024002.000|20110125024004.000|TR0|different, because there is a whole 
20110125024004.000|20110125024006.000|TR0|obligation.  You got a whole country to 
20110125024006.000|20110125024009.000|TR0|run, and you got to be careful.
20110125024009.000|20110125024011.000|TR0|
20110125024011.000|20110125024013.000|TR0|MORGAN:  And you are the commander in 
20110125024013.000|20110125024015.000|TR0|chief.  You can supersede.
20110125024015.000|20110125024018.000|TR0|
20110125024018.000|20110125024020.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I honestly don't know what I 
20110125024020.000|20110125024022.000|TR0|would have done as the president of the 
20110125024022.000|20110125024025.000|TR0|United States, whether I would have tried 
20110125024025.000|20110125024027.000|TR0|to overrule them, or at that particular 
20110125024027.000|20110125024029.000|TR0|moment, not knowing the gravity of the 
20110125024029.000|20110125024032.000|TR0|attack, and not knowing if there would be 
20110125024032.000|20110125024034.000|TR0|five other attacks, listen to what they 
20110125024034.000|20110125024036.000|TR0|said.
20110125024036.000|20110125024039.000|TR0|
20110125024039.000|20110125024041.000|TR0|My instinct, which is good and bad, is to 
20110125024041.000|20110125024043.000|TR0|run to the scene of the -- I remember when 
20110125024043.000|20110125024046.000|TR0|there was first Anthrax was found in New 
20110125024046.000|20110125024048.000|TR0|York a month later.  It was at NBC.  And 
20110125024048.000|20110125024050.000|TR0|the first thing I did I rushed up there.
20110125024050.000|20110125024053.000|TR0|
20110125024053.000|20110125024055.000|TR0|MORGAN:  You rushed towards the Anthrax?  
20110125024055.000|20110125024057.000|TR0|Why would you do that, Rudy?
20110125024057.000|20110125024100.000|TR0|
20110125024100.000|20110125024102.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  My staff used to then tease me 
20110125024102.000|20110125024104.000|TR0|and say oh, gee, we have a little more 
20110125024104.000|20110125024107.000|TR0|Anthrax.  Why don't we rush there?  Why 
20110125024107.000|20110125024109.000|TR0|don't we rush here?  Why don't we rush 
20110125024109.000|20110125024111.000|TR0|there.
20110125024111.000|20110125024114.000|TR0|
20110125024114.000|20110125024116.000|TR0|MORGAN:  But isn't it very, very important 
20110125024116.000|20110125024118.000|TR0|in the modern media age, when everyone is 
20110125024118.000|20110125024120.000|TR0|looking for figureheads and leaders to 
20110125024120.000|20110125024123.000|TR0|emerge.
20110125024123.000|20110125024125.000|TR0|
20110125024125.000|20110125024127.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I think so.
20110125024127.000|20110125024130.000|TR0|
20110125024130.000|20110125024132.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I can remember -- I was in a 
20110125024132.000|20110125024134.000|TR0|newsroom of the "Daily Mirror" newspaper 
20110125024134.000|20110125024137.000|TR0|in London, which I was the editor of.  And 
20110125024137.000|20110125024139.000|TR0|I remember in the chaos seeing you 
20110125024139.000|20110125024141.000|TR0|appearing at the  -- and it was comforting 
20110125024141.000|20110125024144.000|TR0|that somebody was taking charge of this.  
20110125024144.000|20110125024146.000|TR0|And the message going out was America will 
20110125024146.000|20110125024148.000|TR0|not be beaten by this.
20110125024148.000|20110125024151.000|TR0|
20110125024151.000|20110125024153.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I believe that.  That's my 
20110125024153.000|20110125024155.000|TR0|view.  There are other ways to look at it. 
20110125024155.000|20110125024158.000|TR0| There are people who criticized me for 
20110125024158.000|20110125024200.000|TR0|rushing down there.  I could have been 
20110125024200.000|20110125024202.000|TR0|killed.  People could have -- key 
20110125024202.000|20110125024205.000|TR0|significant people in the city could have 
20110125024205.000|20110125024207.000|TR0|been killed.  It wasn't the best place 
20110125024207.000|20110125024209.000|TR0|from which to manage it.  For me it was.
20110125024209.000|20110125024212.000|TR0|
20110125024212.000|20110125024214.000|TR0|I wrote about this in my book.  It's also 
20110125024214.000|20110125024216.000|TR0|something I need to do. In order for me to 
20110125024216.000|20110125024218.000|TR0|manage something, I have to see it to 
20110125024218.000|20110125024221.000|TR0|manage it better.  I've got to assess do 
20110125024221.000|20110125024223.000|TR0|we have enough people.  I've got to look 
20110125024223.000|20110125024225.000|TR0|in the eyes of the commander and say, like 
20110125024225.000|20110125024228.000|TR0|Chief Ganci, who was in charge, 
20110125024228.000|20110125024230.000|TR0|unfortunately lost his life -- I said to 
20110125024230.000|20110125024232.000|TR0|him, do you have enough?  Can you handle 
20110125024232.000|20110125024235.000|TR0|it?  He looked at me and he said yes.
20110125024235.000|20110125024237.000|TR0|
20110125024237.000|20110125024239.000|TR0|I said, can we get people to the top?  Can 
20110125024239.000|20110125024242.000|TR0|we get helicopters to the top to get 
20110125024242.000|20110125024244.000|TR0|people off the roof.  And he looked at me 
20110125024244.000|20110125024246.000|TR0|straight in my eyes and he said, I can't 
20110125024246.000|20110125024249.000|TR0|save anybody above the fire.  And I knew 
20110125024249.000|20110125024251.000|TR0|what he was saying to me because we had 
20110125024251.000|20110125024253.000|TR0|been through so many emergencies before.  
20110125024253.000|20110125024256.000|TR0|He was saying mayor, don't force me to put 
20110125024256.000|20110125024258.000|TR0|firefighters above the fire, or don't 
20110125024258.000|20110125024300.000|TR0|force me to put helicopters because 
20110125024300.000|20110125024303.000|TR0|they'll blow up.  But I'll get everybody 
20110125024303.000|20110125024305.000|TR0|out below the fire.
20110125024305.000|20110125024307.000|TR0|
20110125024307.000|20110125024310.000|TR0|In the 9/11 Commission Report, one of the 
20110125024310.000|20110125024312.000|TR0|things they point out is that firefighters 
20110125024312.000|20110125024314.000|TR0|saved just about everybody below the fire. 
20110125024314.000|20110125024317.000|TR0| I don't think they realize how proud the 
20110125024317.000|20110125024319.000|TR0|fire department is of that. Because, 
20110125024319.000|20110125024321.000|TR0|conceivably, that's all they could have 
20110125024321.000|20110125024323.000|TR0|done.  They could not have gotten above 
20110125024323.000|20110125024326.000|TR0|that fire.
20110125024326.000|20110125024328.000|TR0|
20110125024328.000|20110125024330.000|TR0|It allowed me to take the measure of the 
20110125024330.000|20110125024333.000|TR0|man and understand he's got this under 
20110125024333.000|20110125024335.000|TR0|control.  And sometimes people will tell 
20110125024335.000|20110125024337.000|TR0|you I've got it under control and they 
20110125024337.000|20110125024340.000|TR0|don't.  And you've got to be able to see 
20110125024340.000|20110125024342.000|TR0|them and you've got to know.  You got to 
20110125024342.000|20110125024344.000|TR0|bring in more reinforcements.
20110125024344.000|20110125024347.000|TR0|
20110125024347.000|20110125024349.000|TR0|MORGAN:  We're going to take a break.  I 
20110125024349.000|20110125024351.000|TR0|want to talk to you more about 9/11.  This 
20110125024351.000|20110125024354.000|TR0|is fascinating.
20110125024354.000|20110125024356.000|TR0|

20110125024401.000|20110125024403.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Rudy, you appeared on "Saturday 
20110125024403.000|20110125024405.000|TR0|Night Live" a few weeks after 9/11.  I 
20110125024405.000|20110125024408.000|TR0|want to remind you of what you said on 
20110125024408.000|20110125024410.000|TR0|that show at a the time.

20110125024417.000|20110125024419.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Having our city's institutions 
20110125024419.000|20110125024421.000|TR0|up and running sends a message that New 
20110125024421.000|20110125024424.000|TR0|York City is open for business.  "Saturday 
20110125024424.000|20110125024426.000|TR0|Night Live" is one of our great New York 
20110125024426.000|20110125024428.000|TR0|City institutions.  And that's why it's 
20110125024428.000|20110125024431.000|TR0|important for you to do your show tonight.

20110125024433.000|20110125024435.000|TR0|LORNE MICHAELS, "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE":  
20110125024435.000|20110125024438.000|TR0|Can we be funny?
20110125024438.000|20110125024440.000|TR0|
20110125024440.000|20110125024442.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Why start now?
20110125024442.000|20110125024445.000|TR0|
20110125024445.000|20110125024447.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110125024447.000|20110125024449.000|TR0|
20110125024449.000|20110125024452.000|TR0|MORGAN:  That ironically was one of the 
20110125024452.000|20110125024454.000|TR0|funniest lines I've ever heard on that 
20110125024454.000|20110125024456.000|TR0|show.  It was great line.  Everything 
20110125024456.000|20110125024459.000|TR0|about that was great.  The world was 
20110125024459.000|20110125024501.000|TR0|waiting for something like that.  Everyone 
20110125024501.000|20110125024503.000|TR0|needed to know it was time to not move on, 
20110125024503.000|20110125024506.000|TR0|but to get a grip and say right, America 
20110125024506.000|20110125024508.000|TR0|is not beat.
20110125024508.000|20110125024510.000|TR0|
20110125024510.000|20110125024513.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It's true.  In a situation like 
20110125024513.000|20110125024515.000|TR0|that, what you're trying to do is get 
20110125024515.000|20110125024517.000|TR0|people to get their eyes up, because all 
20110125024517.000|20110125024520.000|TR0|they're doing is looking at the vast 
20110125024520.000|20110125024522.000|TR0|devastation in front of them.  It seems 
20110125024522.000|20110125024524.000|TR0|like the world is going to be like this 
20110125024524.000|20110125024526.000|TR0|forever.  You want to get them to start 
20110125024526.000|20110125024529.000|TR0|thinking about well things can return, 
20110125024529.000|20110125024531.000|TR0|things can return to normal.
20110125024531.000|20110125024533.000|TR0|
20110125024533.000|20110125024536.000|TR0|That was a wonderful thing that Lorne 
20110125024536.000|20110125024538.000|TR0|Michael did, by putting that show on, 
20110125024538.000|20110125024540.000|TR0|proceeded by all the firefighters in the 
20110125024540.000|20110125024543.000|TR0|background.
20110125024543.000|20110125024545.000|TR0|
20110125024545.000|20110125024547.000|TR0|MORGAN:  You became known as America's 
20110125024547.000|20110125024550.000|TR0|Mayor after that.  How did you take that?
20110125024550.000|20110125024552.000|TR0|
20110125024552.000|20110125024554.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  That's not an official 
20110125024554.000|20110125024557.000|TR0|position.       MORGAN:  Everyone called 
20110125024557.000|20110125024559.000|TR0|you that.
20110125024559.000|20110125024601.000|TR0|
20110125024601.000|20110125024604.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It's easier being America's 
20110125024604.000|20110125024606.000|TR0|mayor than New York's mayor.  Nobody calls 
20110125024606.000|20110125024608.000|TR0|you up in the middle of the night.  And 
20110125024608.000|20110125024611.000|TR0|you don't have to pick up the snow.
20110125024611.000|20110125024613.000|TR0|
20110125024613.000|20110125024615.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Is there ever a day when you 
20110125024615.000|20110125024618.000|TR0|don't think about 9/11?
20110125024618.000|20110125024620.000|TR0|
20110125024620.000|20110125024622.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  No, not a day.  You know, after 
20110125024622.000|20110125024625.000|TR0|a couple of years, it was really bothering 
20110125024625.000|20110125024627.000|TR0|me.  I thought, shouldn't I get over this? 
20110125024627.000|20110125024629.000|TR0| And shouldn't I -- but then I just came 
20110125024629.000|20110125024631.000|TR0|to peace with it.  It was the most 
20110125024631.000|20110125024634.000|TR0|significant day of my life, for good and 
20110125024634.000|20110125024636.000|TR0|bad in many ways.  Right? The most 
20110125024636.000|20110125024638.000|TR0|significant day for my city, my country.  
20110125024638.000|20110125024641.000|TR0|I have endless memories of it, good ones 
20110125024641.000|20110125024643.000|TR0|and bad ones.
20110125024643.000|20110125024645.000|TR0|
20110125024645.000|20110125024648.000|TR0|MORGAN:  How did you feel when the 9/11 
20110125024648.000|20110125024650.000|TR0|Health Care Bill was being debated and 
20110125024650.000|20110125024652.000|TR0|there were Republicans who did not want 
20110125024652.000|20110125024655.000|TR0|that to go through?
20110125024655.000|20110125024657.000|TR0|
20110125024657.000|20110125024659.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I was annoyed with using it as 
20110125024659.000|20110125024702.000|TR0|a political device.  I agree -- I was in 
20110125024702.000|20110125024704.000|TR0|the interesting position of agreeing with 
20110125024704.000|20110125024706.000|TR0|the general philosophy and theory that you 
20110125024706.000|20110125024709.000|TR0|should hold up everything until you got 
20110125024709.000|20110125024711.000|TR0|the tax situation resolved and the 
20110125024711.000|20110125024713.000|TR0|financial situation.
20110125024713.000|20110125024716.000|TR0|
20110125024716.000|20110125024718.000|TR0|MORGAN:  -- that transcend politics?
20110125024718.000|20110125024720.000|TR0|
20110125024720.000|20110125024723.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  thought that one transcends 
20110125024723.000|20110125024725.000|TR0|politics.  You weren't gaining anything by 
20110125024725.000|20110125024727.000|TR0|doing that.  I thought on the merits it 
20110125024727.000|20110125024729.000|TR0|should pass.  And I thought politically it 
20110125024729.000|20110125024732.000|TR0|was a big mistake, because Republicans 
20110125024732.000|20110125024734.000|TR0|have largely been enormously supportive of 
20110125024734.000|20110125024736.000|TR0|dealing with all these issues that have 
20110125024736.000|20110125024739.000|TR0|come out of September 11th.  To put us on 
20110125024739.000|20110125024741.000|TR0|the wrong side of it I think was a big 
20110125024741.000|20110125024743.000|TR0|mistake.
20110125024743.000|20110125024746.000|TR0|
20110125024746.000|20110125024748.000|TR0|MORGAN:  What do you think America learned 
20110125024748.000|20110125024750.000|TR0|about itself after 9/11?
20110125024750.000|20110125024753.000|TR0|
20110125024753.000|20110125024755.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  That we're very resilient, that 
20110125024755.000|20110125024757.000|TR0|we can take the worst attack in our 
20110125024757.000|20110125024800.000|TR0|history and we can come back from it.  The 
20110125024800.000|20110125024802.000|TR0|terrorists lost their main objective, 
20110125024802.000|20110125024804.000|TR0|which was to destroy our spirit.  They 
20110125024804.000|20110125024807.000|TR0|tried to kill us to kill us, because of 
20110125024807.000|20110125024809.000|TR0|their own insane thoughts. But they also 
20110125024809.000|20110125024811.000|TR0|thought by doing that, by hitting the 
20110125024811.000|20110125024814.000|TR0|financial capital of America and the 
20110125024814.000|20110125024816.000|TR0|world, to a large extent, and the 
20110125024816.000|20110125024818.000|TR0|political capital, they were going to 
20110125024818.000|20110125024821.000|TR0|destroy our spirit.  And they haven't. New 
20110125024821.000|20110125024823.000|TR0|York is a stronger city now than it was 
20110125024823.000|20110125024825.000|TR0|before.
20110125024825.000|20110125024828.000|TR0|
20110125024828.000|20110125024830.000|TR0|MORGAN:  What was it like being knighted 
20110125024830.000|20110125024832.000|TR0|by the queen of England?
20110125024832.000|20110125024834.000|TR0|
20110125024834.000|20110125024837.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It was fascinating.
20110125024837.000|20110125024839.000|TR0|
20110125024839.000|20110125024841.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I bet it was.
20110125024841.000|20110125024844.000|TR0|
20110125024844.000|20110125024846.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It was really, really 
20110125024846.000|20110125024848.000|TR0|fascinating.  What I did was I got all the 
20110125024848.000|20110125024851.000|TR0|copies of the New York newspapers.  I 
20110125024851.000|20110125024853.000|TR0|picked them up and I kept them and had 
20110125024853.000|20110125024855.000|TR0|none of them sent to Brooklyn, because I 
20110125024855.000|20110125024858.000|TR0|think my old friends in Brooklyn would get 
20110125024858.000|20110125024900.000|TR0|very annoyed with me if I asked them to 
20110125024900.000|20110125024902.000|TR0|call me a sir.  If I said in Brooklyn, you 
20110125024902.000|20110125024905.000|TR0|better call me sir, I would never have any 
20110125024905.000|20110125024907.000|TR0|chance to run for political office again.
20110125024907.000|20110125024909.000|TR0|
20110125024909.000|20110125024912.000|TR0|But it was a great honor for me.  One of 
20110125024912.000|20110125024914.000|TR0|my great heroes is Winston Churchill.  I 
20110125024914.000|20110125024916.000|TR0|became a good friend of Tony Blair, 
20110125024916.000|20110125024919.000|TR0|because I admired him so much.  I admired 
20110125024919.000|20110125024921.000|TR0|Tony Blair because of how he stood with 
20110125024921.000|20110125024923.000|TR0|us.  People think he stood with us -- 
20110125024923.000|20110125024926.000|TR0|these were actually things he believed.
20110125024926.000|20110125024928.000|TR0|
20110125024928.000|20110125024930.000|TR0|He was the person during the Clinton 
20110125024930.000|20110125024932.000|TR0|administration who tried to explain to 
20110125024932.000|20110125024935.000|TR0|President Clinton how we had to be 
20110125024935.000|20110125024937.000|TR0|stronger and tougher about dealing with 
20110125024937.000|20110125024939.000|TR0|terrorism and dealing with some of the 
20110125024939.000|20110125024942.000|TR0|problems in the world.  And you have to 
20110125024942.000|20110125024944.000|TR0|use your military might to some extent in 
20110125024944.000|20110125024946.000|TR0|order to get leverage.
20110125024946.000|20110125024949.000|TR0|
20110125024949.000|20110125024951.000|TR0|I think President Clinton appreciated 
20110125024951.000|20110125024953.000|TR0|that.  So a lot of people think that 
20110125024953.000|20110125024956.000|TR0|President Bush was leading Tony Blair 
20110125024956.000|20110125024958.000|TR0|around to positions he didn't have 
20110125024958.000|20110125025000.000|TR0|internally.  And it's just the opposite.
20110125025000.000|20110125025003.000|TR0|
20110125025003.000|20110125025005.000|TR0|MORGAN:  The interesting thing about Tony 
20110125025005.000|20110125025007.000|TR0|Blair --
20110125025007.000|20110125025010.000|TR0|
20110125025010.000|20110125025012.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Not the opposite.  I think they 
20110125025012.000|20110125025014.000|TR0|both agreed.  But Tony Blair had a very 
20110125025014.000|20110125025017.000|TR0|strong view.  And he once explained it to 
20110125025017.000|20110125025019.000|TR0|me, having to do with his parents being 
20110125025019.000|20110125025021.000|TR0|children of the Second World War, and not 
20110125025021.000|20110125025024.000|TR0|wanting to see that happen again.  >

20110125025026.000|20110125025028.000|TR0|MORGAN:  When we come back, I want to talk 
20110125025028.000|20110125025031.000|TR0|to you about the private side of Rudy 
20110125025031.000|20110125025033.000|TR0|Giuliani.
20110125025033.000|20110125025035.000|TR0|
20110125025035.000|20110125025037.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Sure.
20110125025037.000|20110125025040.000|TR0|
20110125025040.000|20110125025042.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110125025042.000|20110125025044.000|TR0|
20110125025044.000|20110125025047.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Rudy, you're a man that commands 
20110125025047.000|20110125025049.000|TR0|respect around the world.  You've been a 
20110125025049.000|20110125025051.000|TR0|leading politician.  You're someone that I 
20110125025051.000|20110125025054.000|TR0|admired personally after the events of 
20110125025054.000|20110125025056.000|TR0|9/11.  Everything you've done has been 
20110125025056.000|20110125025058.000|TR0|gritty and tough, from taking on the 
20110125025058.000|20110125025101.000|TR0|Mafia, to taking on terrorism, to taking 
20110125025101.000|20110125025103.000|TR0|on Wall Street.  But there is one defining 
20110125025103.000|20110125025105.000|TR0|image that I'd like to show you, which to 
20110125025105.000|20110125025108.000|TR0|me sums up the private side of Rudy 
20110125025108.000|20110125025110.000|TR0|Giuliani.  There it is.  It's --
20110125025110.000|20110125025112.000|TR0|
20110125025112.000|20110125025115.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  How did I know -- I didn't 
20110125025115.000|20110125025117.000|TR0|expect that one.  I expected the Marilyn 
20110125025117.000|20110125025119.000|TR0|Monroe one.  That was from my fine 
20110125025119.000|20110125025122.000|TR0|performance in the musical "The Godfather."
20110125025122.000|20110125025124.000|TR0|
20110125025124.000|20110125025126.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Did you regularly dress up in 
20110125025126.000|20110125025129.000|TR0|women's clothes?
20110125025129.000|20110125025131.000|TR0|
20110125025131.000|20110125025133.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I did it two or three times as 
20110125025133.000|20110125025135.000|TR0|part of --
20110125025135.000|20110125025138.000|TR0|
20110125025138.000|20110125025140.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Once I understand.  More than 
20110125025140.000|20110125025142.000|TR0|that becomes a habit.
20110125025142.000|20110125025145.000|TR0|
20110125025145.000|20110125025147.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  You have to understand this is 
20110125025147.000|20110125025149.000|TR0|my frustration.  I wanted to be a 
20110125025149.000|20110125025152.000|TR0|performer.  This one, we did "The 
20110125025152.000|20110125025154.000|TR0|Godfather," the musical.  I always thought 
20110125025154.000|20110125025156.000|TR0|there should be a musical version.  We 
20110125025156.000|20110125025159.000|TR0|wrote our own, except we wrote in New York 
20110125025159.000|20110125025201.000|TR0|City political figures as part of the 
20110125025201.000|20110125025203.000|TR0|spoof.
20110125025203.000|20110125025206.000|TR0|
20110125025206.000|20110125025208.000|TR0|MORGAN:  If you could have been an actor, 
20110125025208.000|20110125025210.000|TR0|a successful one, would you have swapped 
20110125025210.000|20110125025213.000|TR0|that for politics?  Would you have rather 
20110125025213.000|20110125025215.000|TR0|been a great movie star, do you think?
20110125025215.000|20110125025217.000|TR0|
20110125025217.000|20110125025220.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  No, I think I -- I had a much 
20110125025220.000|20110125025222.000|TR0|better career than I ever expected.
20110125025222.000|20110125025224.000|TR0|
20110125025224.000|20110125025227.000|TR0|MORGAN:  You have a good look for a 
20110125025227.000|20110125025229.000|TR0|"Godfather" part.
20110125025229.000|20110125025231.000|TR0|
20110125025231.000|20110125025234.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I played the Marlon Brando role.
20110125025234.000|20110125025236.000|TR0|
20110125025236.000|20110125025238.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Oh you did.  I'm downgrading you. 
20110125025238.000|20110125025240.000|TR0| I'm sorry.
20110125025240.000|20110125025243.000|TR0|
20110125025243.000|20110125025245.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I put the gauze in my mouth.
20110125025245.000|20110125025247.000|TR0|
20110125025247.000|20110125025250.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Go on, give me the voice.
20110125025250.000|20110125025252.000|TR0|
20110125025252.000|20110125025254.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  How did we ever let things get 
20110125025254.000|20110125025257.000|TR0|this far?  How can you ask me these 
20110125025257.000|20110125025259.000|TR0|questions?  How can you ask me these 
20110125025259.000|20110125025301.000|TR0|questions?
20110125025301.000|20110125025304.000|TR0|
20110125025304.000|20110125025306.000|TR0|MORGAN:  How is marriage the third time 
20110125025306.000|20110125025308.000|TR0|around?
20110125025308.000|20110125025311.000|TR0|
20110125025311.000|20110125025313.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  It's fabulous.  Judith is a 
20110125025313.000|20110125025315.000|TR0|wonderful lady.  She's a nurse, which 
20110125025315.000|20110125025318.000|TR0|helps her a lot dealing with my prostate 
20110125025318.000|20110125025320.000|TR0|cancer, and helps me a lot in dealing with 
20110125025320.000|20110125025322.000|TR0|everything.  She's got a great knowledge 
20110125025322.000|20110125025325.000|TR0|of medicine.  And she's got a great 
20110125025325.000|20110125025327.000|TR0|knowledge of the world. She speaks fluent 
20110125025327.000|20110125025329.000|TR0|French, pretty good Spanish, so she does a 
20110125025329.000|20110125025332.000|TR0|lot of translating for me.  She's a 
20110125025332.000|20110125025334.000|TR0|fabulous lady.
20110125025334.000|20110125025336.000|TR0|
20110125025336.000|20110125025338.000|TR0|MORGAN:  The extraordinary thing about 
20110125025338.000|20110125025341.000|TR0|you, Rudy, is for at least two or three 
20110125025341.000|20110125025343.000|TR0|years now, there's been no scandalous 
20110125025343.000|20110125025345.000|TR0|headlines about your private life.
20110125025345.000|20110125025348.000|TR0|
20110125025348.000|20110125025350.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Make it about eight 
20110125025350.000|20110125025352.000|TR0|years, maybe 10.
20110125025352.000|20110125025355.000|TR0|
20110125025355.000|20110125025357.000|TR0|MORGAN:  If you were to run for --
20110125025357.000|20110125025359.000|TR0|
20110125025359.000|20110125025402.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Maybe ten years.  There should 
20110125025402.000|20110125025404.000|TR0|be a statute of limitations.  Ten years 
20110125025404.000|20110125025406.000|TR0|would be a good statute of limitation.
20110125025406.000|20110125025409.000|TR0|
20110125025409.000|20110125025411.000|TR0|MORGAN:  If you were to run again for 
20110125025411.000|20110125025413.000|TR0|presidency -- and there's got to be a good 
20110125025413.000|20110125025416.000|TR0|chance -- all that stuff would get raked 
20110125025416.000|20110125025418.000|TR0|up again. How do you feel about that?
20110125025418.000|20110125025420.000|TR0|
20110125025420.000|20110125025423.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  You don't feel good about it, 
20110125025423.000|20110125025425.000|TR0|because it affects your family.  I'm kind 
20110125025425.000|20110125025427.000|TR0|of immune to it, personally, because I've 
20110125025427.000|20110125025430.000|TR0|been in public life for 30 years, and been 
20110125025430.000|20110125025432.000|TR0|called every name possible.  And I know 
20110125025432.000|20110125025434.000|TR0|people hate me, people love me, and people 
20110125025434.000|20110125025437.000|TR0|have a balanced view of me, which is what 
20110125025437.000|20110125025439.000|TR0|you should have.
20110125025439.000|20110125025441.000|TR0|
20110125025441.000|20110125025443.000|TR0|You worry about it for your family, 
20110125025443.000|20110125025446.000|TR0|because it does affect them. When they 
20110125025446.000|20110125025448.000|TR0|live through it, it's a little bit harder, 
20110125025448.000|20110125025450.000|TR0|because they're not as used to it as I am, 
20110125025450.000|20110125025453.000|TR0|even if they've been with me for a long 
20110125025453.000|20110125025455.000|TR0|time.
20110125025455.000|20110125025457.000|TR0|
20110125025457.000|20110125025500.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Did you have any big regrets 
20110125025500.000|20110125025502.000|TR0|about the impact of your political life on 
20110125025502.000|20110125025504.000|TR0|your family life?
20110125025504.000|20110125025507.000|TR0|
20110125025507.000|20110125025509.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Sure, I guess you'd wished if 
20110125025509.000|20110125025511.000|TR0|you had gone back, you had done it better, 
20110125025511.000|20110125025514.000|TR0|done it differently.  The problem is in 
20110125025514.000|20110125025516.000|TR0|life, you can't go back.  You can't -- you 
20110125025516.000|20110125025518.000|TR0|get to try to fix it from where you are, 
20110125025518.000|20110125025521.000|TR0|rather than go back and try to fix it, 
20110125025521.000|20110125025523.000|TR0|which I'm trying to do.
20110125025523.000|20110125025525.000|TR0|
20110125025525.000|20110125025528.000|TR0|MORGAN:  We discussed the worst day of 
20110125025528.000|20110125025530.000|TR0|your life, 9/11.  You've made no secret of 
20110125025530.000|20110125025532.000|TR0|that.  What would you say has been the 
20110125025532.000|20110125025535.000|TR0|best day of your life?
20110125025535.000|20110125025537.000|TR0|
20110125025537.000|20110125025539.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Probably the same day.  Because 
20110125025539.000|20110125025541.000|TR0|I don't think I ever saw more heroism, 
20110125025541.000|20110125025544.000|TR0|more tremendous outpouring of love, people 
20110125025544.000|20110125025546.000|TR0|to people.  When I say day, I mean period 
20110125025546.000|20110125025548.000|TR0|of time.  You showed a picture of Hillary 
20110125025548.000|20110125025551.000|TR0|Clinton and me there.  You know, people 
20110125025551.000|20110125025553.000|TR0|couldn't imagine Hillary Clinton and I 
20110125025553.000|20110125025555.000|TR0|could work together.  And we worked 
20110125025555.000|20110125025558.000|TR0|together very closely.  Or Chuck Schumer, 
20110125025558.000|20110125025600.000|TR0|or -- there were no Republicans, no 
20110125025600.000|20110125025602.000|TR0|Democrats, just trying to help people.
20110125025602.000|20110125025605.000|TR0|
20110125025605.000|20110125025607.000|TR0|I brought Putin and Schroeder and all the 
20110125025607.000|20110125025609.000|TR0|world leaders there. They were all truly 
20110125025609.000|20110125025612.000|TR0|horrified by it, and willing to help.  It 
20110125025612.000|20110125025614.000|TR0|was a very special --
20110125025614.000|20110125025616.000|TR0|
20110125025616.000|20110125025619.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Out of an attempt to really 
20110125025619.000|20110125025621.000|TR0|demoralize and destabilize America, oddly 
20110125025621.000|20110125025623.000|TR0|unity and strength came out of that?
20110125025623.000|20110125025626.000|TR0|
20110125025626.000|20110125025628.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Yes.  And so in a way, it was 
20110125025628.000|20110125025630.000|TR0|the worst and the best day, largely 
20110125025630.000|20110125025633.000|TR0|because of the way people reacted.  One of 
20110125025633.000|20110125025635.000|TR0|the great vivid scenes for me were all the 
20110125025635.000|20110125025637.000|TR0|construction workers that came and 
20110125025637.000|20110125025640.000|TR0|volunteered about 3:00, 4:00 in the 
20110125025640.000|20110125025642.000|TR0|afternoon.  Nobody asked for them. Nobody 
20110125025642.000|20110125025644.000|TR0|organized them.  There are all these big 
20110125025644.000|20110125025646.000|TR0|guys with these big muscles.  They're 
20110125025646.000|20110125025649.000|TR0|going come and just lift -- they're just 
20110125025649.000|20110125025651.000|TR0|going to lift us out of it.
20110125025651.000|20110125025653.000|TR0|
20110125025653.000|20110125025656.000|TR0|Somehow, I was really down.  I had found 
20110125025656.000|20110125025658.000|TR0|out about the loss of some friends, and I 
20110125025658.000|20110125025700.000|TR0|saw their big muscles.  I said, boy I have 
20110125025700.000|20110125025703.000|TR0|big shoulders to lean on.  It just kind of 
20110125025703.000|20110125025705.000|TR0|lifted me up.
20110125025705.000|20110125025707.000|TR0|
20110125025707.000|20110125025710.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Would you come back nearer the 
20110125025710.000|20110125025712.000|TR0|time of the anniversary?
20110125025712.000|20110125025714.000|TR0|
20110125025714.000|20110125025717.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Yeah, I will.
20110125025717.000|20110125025719.000|TR0|
20110125025719.000|20110125025721.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I found it really fascinating.
20110125025721.000|20110125025724.000|TR0|
20110125025724.000|20110125025726.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I'm wondering how I'm going to 
20110125025726.000|20110125025728.000|TR0|react to the ten-year situation.
20110125025728.000|20110125025731.000|TR0|
20110125025731.000|20110125025733.000|TR0|MORGAN:  It will be an extraordinary time 
20110125025733.000|20110125025735.000|TR0|for you.
20110125025735.000|20110125025738.000|TR0|
20110125025738.000|20110125025740.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  I would appreciate that.  Thank 
20110125025740.000|20110125025742.000|TR0|you very much.
20110125025742.000|20110125025744.000|TR0|
20110125025744.000|20110125025747.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Rudy, thank you.
20110125025747.000|20110125025749.000|TR0|
20110125025749.000|20110125025751.000|TR0|GIULIANI:  Thank you, Piers.  Good luck.
20110125025751.000|20110125025754.000|TR0|
20110125025754.000|20110125025756.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I appreciate that.  Thank you.
20110125025756.000|20110125025758.000|TR0|
20110125025758.000|20110125025801.000|TR0|Tomorrow night, I'll be part of CNN's 
20110125025801.000|20110125025803.000|TR0|State of the Union coverage.  And on 
20110125025803.000|20110125025805.000|TR0|Wednesday, I'll be back with Joel and 
20110125025805.000|20110125025808.000|TR0|Victoria Osteen to discuss the faith of 
20110125025808.000|20110125025810.000|TR0|the union.     (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110125025810.000|20110125025812.000|TR0|
20110125025812.000|20110125025815.000|TR0|JOEL OSTEEN, PREACHER:  I think, in one 
20110125025815.000|20110125025817.000|TR0|sense, that we do need to change, like has 
20110125025817.000|20110125025819.000|TR0|been talked about a lot now, to let go a 
20110125025819.000|20110125025822.000|TR0|little bit of the anger.  To me, it's OK 
20110125025822.000|20110125025824.000|TR0|to have differences, but we don't have to 
20110125025824.000|20110125025826.000|TR0|be mad about it.  I think that's where 
20110125025826.000|20110125025829.000|TR0|sometimes we get so passionate that we -- 
20110125025829.000|20110125025831.000|TR0|you know, it turns into anger, and I don't 
20110125025831.000|20110125025833.000|TR0|like you because you don't agree exactly 
20110125025833.000|20110125025836.000|TR0|with me.
20110125025836.000|20110125025838.000|TR0|
20110125025838.000|20110125025840.000|TR0|That's not what makes our country great.  
20110125025840.000|20110125025843.000|TR0|I'd like to say, you know what, we can be 
20110125025843.000|20110125025845.000|TR0|civil.  We can still be friends and be 
20110125025845.000|20110125025847.000|TR0|Democrats and Republicans and have 
20110125025847.000|20110125025849.000|TR0|different views.
20110125025849.000|20110125025852.000|TR0|
20110125025852.000|20110125025854.000|TR0|MORGAN:  What is your view?  It seems to 
20110125025854.000|20110125025856.000|TR0|change, depending on the interview I've 
20110125025856.000|20110125025859.000|TR0|read or seen.  Is homosexuality a sin in 
20110125025859.000|20110125025901.000|TR0|your eyes?
20110125025901.000|20110125025903.000|TR0|
20110125025903.000|20110125025906.000|TR0|OSTEEN:  Yes, I've always believed, Piers, 
20110125025906.000|20110125025908.000|TR0|the scripture shows that it's a sin.  But, 
20110125025908.000|20110125025910.000|TR0|you know, I'm not one of those that are 
20110125025910.000|20110125025913.000|TR0|out there to bash homosexuals and tell 
20110125025913.000|20110125025915.000|TR0|them they're terrible people and all that. 
20110125025915.000|20110125025917.000|TR0| There are other sins in the Bible too.
20110125025917.000|20110125025920.000|TR0|
20110125025920.000|20110125025922.000|TR0|I think sometimes the church -- I don't 
20110125025922.000|20110125025924.000|TR0|mean this critically, but we focus on one 
20110125025924.000|20110125025927.000|TR0|issue or two issues and there's plenty of 
20110125025927.000|20110125025929.000|TR0|other ones. So I don't believe
