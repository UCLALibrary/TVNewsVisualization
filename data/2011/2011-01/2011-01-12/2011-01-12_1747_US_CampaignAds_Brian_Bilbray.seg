20110112174700.839|20110112175229.800|TR1|one of the latest political stories of the year was the midterm elections said even president obama i guess called the nation a lacking so when the one hundred twelve congress convenes next year the republicans will control the house and that could mean sem big changes and joining us tonight is san diego area republican congressman brian bilbray thanks for joining us rusty now that republicans are right in control what is the ngo peas new year's resolution financial of one of the house is which is the house it doesn't do treaties but does the budget and i think that is going to be the real test i think the voters are going to really look at the new republican majority in the house and really put into the test like my my son patrick o'brien patrick said he said that you were given a mandate the or given up marching orders and i think that spending is going to be the one place where obvious new majority the house is going to be really really judge by and i think that's going to be a critical test one of the big rumblings of course is health care reform in and republicans at least the republican leadership has said we want to repeal it we want to roll it back are you going to be able to do that this year what you can't get the present assignment the repeal you're not going to get the senate to approve the repeal but the spending part about it is the item and i remember when this health care supposedly health care bill which really was a health insurance bill didn't even provide health care was sold it was sold to save money now the data's been come come out now that the that the auditors of look at it's going to cost more money and i think that's what really sets people also the spending for that the hiring of the sixteen thousand new i_r_s_ agents i think that's going to be a hard press when we're talking about the type of fiscal crisis we're in right now so i think that sp the spending that is tied to the health care bill is going is really in doubt along with a lot of other spending rightfully so one of the top priorities has to be finding more americans jobs i mean the unemployment rate is just achha outlandish specially here in california what kind of impact do you think the change in numbers will have for republican small we need to start happening staining that you cannot operate a modern economy without without undp cost-effective energy we've we've got a situation where mari konni cannot support a system where energy cost more than labor so what we're going to be looking at is allowing things like nuclear power to move forward stop subsidies for things like ethanol which are environmentally and economically very damaging and wasted effort we're talking about ways that we can actually move this we got be brave enough to step forward and say that when you talk about building the next generation nuclear power plants are not talking about just liked receipt of my job to come up people's prosperity these are the kind of things that the government needs to be working at kraina foundations for the private sector created job not government we create the playing field to where the competition can create the opportunity we don't create the opportunity really create the ground that where opportunity really covers one issue that's going to keep on percolating in that city immigration of course it's very important people here in california how is that going to come out of this congress is there a way to get both parties together and some kind of comprehensive plan jobs that's all you do you what you say is let's make sure that no job in the united states goes to somebody who's not legally here that job should be for 'em before americans and legal immigrants and not even the way we do that is we go after the source of the illegal immigration and that's not the border it is the employers who are hiring them and universal application of the verify a system that's very simple eliminating tax deductions for employers who hire illegals by forcing them to the verified and where we now get the i_r_s_ agents going instead of going after people for not having health care insurance we go after the employers for writing off the business deductions bomb for hiring people who really girly here which will be against the law it by the legislation is communities in january pat and i think that's simple kind of thing the sign anti-immigrant but it's anti-u_n_ tone ploy here in the people exploiting taking advantage and cap lies in office issue and i think that one of the things that's going to wake up as the violence of the border is finally now starting to get the attention washington you can't have thirty three thousand people killed laius seventy-two just water objet for no other reason than they were trying to enter the country legally they were held hostage that kind of thing the washington has to respond to some now that we stop the amnesty proposals the concert so we were neelu immigration now we got a concentrating on stop the reward to the employers who are hiring illegals that that's one thing that i think the republicans and democrats can get together as americans the legal employment we can work together money of course is always on everybody's mind in the u_s_ government has been in a very spending the last year what's going to be done to bring down the deficit i think you're going to see across the board mandated i think you're going to see farm subsidies going out to be knocked off my dad doctor tom coburn that the senator from oklahoma that we're going to go out to the ethanol subsidy huge subsidy we've got to talk about allot of these issues that we've not been willing to do that means republican supporters are going to take a hit along with democrats supporters and everybody s got to go and i think this is where the independent voters are going to judge us are you willing to tell your friends no more subsidies no more money they don't trust the weight of federal government esp any money that's one thing i get upset my colleagues though republicans we talk about government no we're talking federal government this is even this is different than a mayor city council lisa people that you will never meet your life span you are not earn money growing political changes in washington congressman thank you for being here today and happy new year yet happy new year from original incoming because the folders have said they wanted canceled
