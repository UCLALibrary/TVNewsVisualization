20110112140033.578|20110112140034.812|TR0|dead and 13 others injured. 
20110112140034.812|20110112140036.047|TR0|Doctors say they expect Giffords 
20110112140036.047|20110112140037.281|TR0|to survive the attack, but the 
20110112140037.281|20110112140038.516|TR0|extent of her recovery remains 
20110112140038.516|20110112140039.750|TR0|unknown. The chief neurosurgeon 
20110112140039.750|20110112140040.984|TR0|at the University Medical 
20110112140040.984|20110112140042.219|TR0|Center, Michael Lemole, assessed

20110112140044.688|20110112140045.922|TR0|Dr. Michael Lemole: "She's going 
20110112140045.922|20110112140047.156|TR0|to take her recovery at her own 
20110112140047.156|20110112140048.391|TR0|pace, and I'm very encouraged by 
20110112140048.391|20110112140049.625|TR0|the fact that she has done so 
20110112140049.625|20110112140050.860|TR0|well. This kind of injury - I 
20110112140050.860|20110112140052.094|TR0|think we've said it a couple 
20110112140052.094|20110112140053.328|TR0|times - a penetrating injury 
20110112140053.328|20110112140054.563|TR0|through the skull, really, the 
20110112140054.563|20110112140055.797|TR0|survival, let alone recovery, is 
20110112140055.797|20110112140057.032|TR0|abysmal. She has no right to 
20110112140057.032|20110112140058.266|TR0|look this good, and she does. 
20110112140058.266|20110112140059.501|TR0|We're hopeful, but I do want to 
20110112140059.501|20110112140100.735|TR0|underscore the seriousness of 
20110112140100.735|20110112140101.969|TR0|this injury and the fact that we 
20110112140101.969|20110112140103.204|TR0|all have to be extremely

20110112140120.485|20110112140121.720|TR0|we wish that we could change the

20110112140409.599|20110112140410.834|TR0|not have to happen. It was both

20110112141013.749|20110112141014.984|TR0|>> LT.-GEN. KEN KEEN: What we've 
20110112141014.984|20110112141016.218|TR0|been doing thus far is, in a 
20110112141016.218|20110112141017.452|TR0|crisis reaction, obviously, to 
20110112141017.452|20110112141018.687|TR0|the situation, pushing out as 
20110112141018.687|20110112141019.921|TR0|much as we can to address the 
20110112141019.921|20110112141021.156|TR0|immediate needs. It takes an 
20110112141021.156|20110112141022.390|TR0|estimated one million rations a 
20110112141022.390|20110112141023.625|TR0|day in order to sustain it.
20110112141023.625|20110112141024.859|TR0|
20110112141024.859|20110112141026.093|TR0|>> DR. EVAN LYON: This aid 
20110112141026.093|20110112141027.328|TR0|attention is nice. The extra 
20110112141027.328|20110112141028.562|TR0|supplies are nice. The energy 
20110112141028.562|20110112141029.797|TR0|and the money is helpful. But if 
20110112141029.797|20110112141031.031|TR0|the Haitian institutions are not 
20110112141031.031|20110112141032.265|TR0|rebuilt, nothing will be 
20110112141032.265|20110112141033.500|TR0|durable, and in one year we'll 
20110112141033.500|20110112141034.734|TR0|be exactly where we are right 
20110112141034.734|20110112141035.969|TR0|now, which is in pain.

20110112141037.203|20110112141038.437|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And one year

20110112141040.906|20110112141042.141|TR0|in Health, are agonizingly true: 
20110112141042.141|20110112141043.375|TR0|Haiti is still in pain. If 
20110112141043.375|20110112141044.609|TR0|anything, the situation has 
20110112141044.609|20110112141045.844|TR0|gotten worse. A cholera epidemic 
20110112141045.844|20110112141047.078|TR0|has spread throughout the 
20110112141047.078|20110112141048.313|TR0|country, killing more than 3,600 
20110112141048.313|20110112141049.547|TR0|people, infecting more than 
20110112141049.547|20110112141050.781|TR0|170,000. More than a million 
20110112141050.781|20110112141052.016|TR0|people remain homeless, still 
20110112141052.016|20110112141053.250|TR0|living in makeshift shelters in

20110112141331.254|20110112141332.489|TR0|the capital city has not been 
20110112141332.489|20110112141333.723|TR0|removed, other than some 
20110112141333.723|20110112141334.958|TR0|arteries that lead into the 
20110112141334.958|20110112141336.192|TR0|city. And reconstruction, as 
20110112141336.192|20110112141337.426|TR0|envisioned by both the Interim 
20110112141337.426|20110112141338.661|TR0|Haiti Recovery Commission and 
20110112141338.661|20110112141339.895|TR0|the Haitian government, has not 
20110112141339.895|20110112141341.130|TR0|begun. Most people - most of the 
20110112141341.130|20110112141342.364|TR0|homeless, those displaced by the 
20110112141342.364|20110112141343.598|TR0|earthquake, are still living in 
20110112141343.598|20110112141344.833|TR0|shelters, though the number has 
20110112141344.833|20110112141346.067|TR0|dropped to less than a million. 
20110112141346.067|20110112141347.302|TR0|From the latest figures that 
20110112141347.302|20110112141348.536|TR0|I've seen, it seems to be around 
20110112141348.536|20110112141349.770|TR0|800,000. But it's not clear 
20110112141349.770|20110112141351.005|TR0|under what conditions those who 
20110112141351.005|20110112141352.239|TR0|have left the camps are still 
20110112141352.239|20110112141353.474|TR0|living. Electricity is still in 
20110112141353.474|20110112141354.708|TR0|short supply. Water is not 
20110112141354.708|20110112141355.943|TR0|available to most citizens of 
20110112141355.943|20110112141357.177|TR0|the city, and especially in the 
20110112141357.177|20110112141358.411|TR0|camps, where they're being 
20110112141358.411|20110112141359.646|TR0|delivered by aid organizations. 
20110112141359.646|20110112141400.880|TR0|Hospitals have not been rebuilt. 
20110112141400.880|20110112141402.115|TR0|Healthcare is not being 
20110112141402.115|20110112141403.349|TR0|delivered, and so on. So, the 
20110112141403.349|20110112141404.583|TR0|condition is pretty much as 
20110112141404.583|20110112141405.818|TR0|you've described it, that it's 
20110112141405.818|20110112141407.052|TR0|pretty grim a year later, 
20110112141407.052|20110112141408.287|TR0|though, of course, given the 
20110112141408.287|20110112141409.521|TR0|extent of the damage, 
20110112141409.521|20110112141410.755|TR0|reconstruction would be slow. 
20110112141410.755|20110112141411.990|TR0|But at least one would have 
20110112141411.990|20110112141413.224|TR0|hoped that more progress would 
20110112141413.224|20110112141414.459|TR0|have been achieved at this point.

20110112141415.693|20110112141416.927|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Professor Dupuy, 
20110112141416.927|20110112141418.162|TR0|you wrote a piece in the 
20110112141418.162|20110112141419.396|TR0|Washington Post called "Foreign 
20110112141419.396|20110112141420.631|TR0|Aid Keeps the Country from 
20110112141420.631|20110112141421.865|TR0|Shaping Its Own Future." Explain 
20110112141421.865|20110112141423.099|TR0|what you mean. Lay out your 
20110112141423.099|20110112141424.334|TR0|argument.
20110112141424.334|20110112141425.568|TR0|
20110112141425.568|20110112141426.803|TR0|>> ALEX DUPUY: Well, my argument 
20110112141426.803|20110112141428.037|TR0|is basically twofold. One is to 
20110112141428.037|20110112141429.272|TR0|distinguish between the 
20110112141429.272|20110112141430.506|TR0|humanitarian aid, the massive 
20110112141430.506|20110112141431.740|TR0|humanitarian aid that was given 
20110112141431.740|20110112141432.975|TR0|to Haiti immediately after the 
20110112141432.975|20110112141434.209|TR0|earthquake, and the long-term  
20110112141434.209|20110112141435.444|TR0|--  the short- and long-term 
20110112141435.444|20110112141436.678|TR0|reconstruction of Haiti as 
20110112141436.678|20110112141437.912|TR0|envisioned by the international 
20110112141437.912|20110112141439.147|TR0|community. And by the 
20110112141439.147|20110112141440.381|TR0|international community, I mean 
20110112141440.381|20110112141441.616|TR0|the major foreign powers, such 
20110112141441.616|20110112141442.850|TR0|as the United States, Canada and 
20110112141442.850|20110112141444.084|TR0|France, and the international 
20110112141444.084|20110112141445.319|TR0|financial institutions - the 
20110112141445.319|20110112141446.553|TR0|World Bank, the IMF, the USAID 
20110112141446.553|20110112141447.788|TR0|and the Inter-American 
20110112141447.788|20110112141449.022|TR0|Development Bank. And the 
20110112141449.022|20110112141450.256|TR0|problem here, as I see it, is 
20110112141450.256|20110112141451.491|TR0|that the strategies that they 
20110112141451.491|20110112141452.725|TR0|have devised for Haiti's 
20110112141452.725|20110112141453.960|TR0|reconstruction are no different 
20110112141453.960|20110112141455.194|TR0|than the strategies that they 
20110112141455.194|20110112141456.428|TR0|had put in place in Haiti for 
20110112141456.428|20110112141457.663|TR0|the past three decades or more 
20110112141457.663|20110112141458.897|TR0|that have proven to have failed. 
20110112141458.897|20110112141500.132|TR0|Those strategies were based on a 
20110112141500.132|20110112141501.366|TR0|twofold strategy. One was to 
20110112141501.366|20110112141502.601|TR0|transform Haiti into a supplier 
20110112141502.601|20110112141503.835|TR0|of the cheapest labor in the 
20110112141503.835|20110112141505.069|TR0|region for the garment industry, 
20110112141505.069|20110112141506.304|TR0|for export primarily to the 
20110112141506.304|20110112141507.538|TR0|United States, and the other was 
20110112141507.538|20110112141508.773|TR0|to dismantle all protective 
20110112141508.773|20110112141510.007|TR0|tariffs against food imports and 
20110112141510.007|20110112141511.241|TR0|other imports into Haiti that 
20110112141511.241|20110112141512.476|TR0|resulted in the devastation of 
20110112141512.476|20110112141513.710|TR0|Haitian agriculture, to the 
20110112141513.710|20110112141514.945|TR0|point where Haiti went from 
20110112141514.945|20110112141516.179|TR0|being able to produce up to 80 
20110112141516.179|20110112141517.413|TR0|percent of its food in the 
20110112141517.413|20110112141518.648|TR0|mid-1980s to now importing - to 
20110112141518.648|20110112141519.882|TR0|producing only 42 percent, and 
20110112141519.882|20110112141521.117|TR0|especially rice production, 
20110112141521.117|20110112141522.351|TR0|which is a major staple crop in 
20110112141522.351|20110112141523.585|TR0|Haiti, where Haiti used to have 
20110112141523.585|20110112141524.820|TR0|self-sufficiency in producing 
20110112141524.820|20110112141526.054|TR0|rice. Now it's the largest - the 
20110112141526.054|20110112141527.289|TR0|fourth largest importer of U.S. 
20110112141527.289|20110112141528.523|TR0|rice in the world. And former 
20110112141528.523|20110112141529.757|TR0|President Clinton himself 
20110112141529.757|20110112141530.992|TR0|admitted in testimony to the 
20110112141530.992|20110112141532.226|TR0|Senate Foreign Committee that 
20110112141532.226|20110112141533.461|TR0|the strategies that he himself 
20110112141533.461|20110112141534.695|TR0|had pushed on Haiti have not 
20110112141534.695|20110112141535.929|TR0|worked. They have benefited his 
20110112141535.929|20110112141537.164|TR0|farmers in Arkansas, but they 
20110112141537.164|20110112141538.398|TR0|were detrimental to Haitian 
20110112141538.398|20110112141539.633|TR0|agricultural production, 
20110112141539.633|20110112141540.867|TR0|especially rice. Yet, it is - 
20110112141540.867|20110112141542.102|TR0|these are the same policies that 
20110112141542.102|20110112141543.336|TR0|are now being pushed again on 
20110112141543.336|20110112141544.570|TR0|Haiti by the Interim Haiti 
20110112141544.570|20110112141545.805|TR0|Commission, which he and Prime 
20110112141545.805|20110112141547.039|TR0|Minister Jean-Max Bellerive 
20110112141547.039|20110112141548.274|TR0|co-chair.
20110112141548.274|20110112141549.508|TR0|
20110112141549.508|20110112141550.742|TR0|But I should point out that 
20110112141550.742|20110112141551.977|TR0|within the commission, even 
20110112141551.977|20110112141553.211|TR0|though there are equal numbers 
20110112141553.211|20110112141554.446|TR0|of Haitians and foreign members 
20110112141554.446|20110112141555.680|TR0|on the committee, that the 
20110112141555.680|20110112141556.914|TR0|foreign members of the committee 
20110112141556.914|20110112141558.149|TR0|call all the shots. And the 
20110112141558.149|20110112141559.383|TR0|Haitians have, in fact, openly 
20110112141559.383|20110112141600.618|TR0|complained that they are being 
20110112141600.618|20110112141601.852|TR0|excluded from meetings and from 
20110112141601.852|20110112141603.086|TR0|decision-making processes. 
20110112141603.086|20110112141604.321|TR0|Moreover, when the commission 
20110112141604.321|20110112141605.555|TR0|was being set up and the Action 
20110112141605.555|20110112141606.790|TR0|Plan for Reconstruction of Haiti 
20110112141606.790|20110112141608.024|TR0|was being developed, Haitian 
20110112141608.024|20110112141609.258|TR0|grassroots organizations, 
20110112141609.258|20110112141610.493|TR0|organizations from civil society 
20110112141610.493|20110112141611.727|TR0|that represented a cross-section 
20110112141611.727|20110112141612.962|TR0|of the Haitian population, were 
20110112141612.962|20110112141614.196|TR0|systematically sidelined. They 
20110112141614.196|20110112141615.431|TR0|were ignored. Their voices were 
20110112141615.431|20110112141616.665|TR0|ignored. And yet, they are the 
20110112141616.665|20110112141617.899|TR0|ones who have been proposing 
20110112141617.899|20110112141619.134|TR0|meaningful alternatives for a 
20110112141619.134|20110112141620.368|TR0|more progressive, more just, 
20110112141620.368|20110112141621.603|TR0|more equal reconstruction of 
20110112141621.603|20110112141622.837|TR0|Haiti. So the point that I was 
20110112141622.837|20110112141624.071|TR0|trying to make in the op-ed in 
20110112141624.071|20110112141625.306|TR0|the Washington Post was 
20110112141625.306|20110112141626.540|TR0|precisely that the objectives of 
20110112141626.540|20110112141627.775|TR0|the foreign community, so to 
20110112141627.775|20110112141629.009|TR0|speak, the international 
20110112141629.009|20110112141630.243|TR0|community, is not so much about 
20110112141630.243|20110112141631.478|TR0|Haiti as it is about helping 
20110112141631.478|20110112141632.712|TR0|their own firms, their own 
20110112141632.712|20110112141633.947|TR0|farmers, their own - you know, 
20110112141633.947|20110112141635.181|TR0|their own exporters and their 
20110112141635.181|20110112141636.415|TR0|own economies, rather than that 
20110112141636.415|20110112141637.650|TR0|of Haiti and the Haitian - and 
20110112141637.650|20110112141638.884|TR0|the needs, meeting the needs of 
20110112141638.884|20110112141640.119|TR0|the Haitian people.
20110112141640.119|20110112141641.353|TR0|
20110112141641.353|20110112141642.587|TR0|The other point that I raised in 
20110112141642.587|20110112141643.822|TR0|the piece was that Haiti has now 
20110112141643.822|20110112141645.056|TR0|been transformed into what has 
20110112141645.056|20110112141646.291|TR0|been correctly called the 
20110112141646.291|20110112141647.525|TR0|"Republic of the NGOs." And this 
20110112141647.525|20110112141648.760|TR0|is a strategy that was started 
20110112141648.760|20110112141649.994|TR0|about, oh, three decades ago 
20110112141649.994|20110112141651.228|TR0|whereby foreign donors would 
20110112141651.228|20110112141652.463|TR0|systematically bypass the 
20110112141652.463|20110112141653.697|TR0|Haitian state and fund instead 
20110112141653.697|20110112141654.932|TR0|non-governmental organizations 
20110112141654.932|20110112141656.166|TR0|to provide services to the 
20110112141656.166|20110112141657.400|TR0|Haitian population, in effect 
20110112141657.400|20110112141658.635|TR0|rendering the state even weaker 
20110112141658.635|20110112141659.869|TR0|than it was before and making it 
20110112141659.869|20110112141701.104|TR0|less able to respond to the 
20110112141701.104|20110112141702.338|TR0|needs of its citizens. Now, the 
20110112141702.338|20110112141703.572|TR0|Haitian state has a long history 
20110112141703.572|20110112141704.807|TR0|of neglecting the needs of the 
20110112141704.807|20110112141706.041|TR0|majority of Haitians, but rather 
20110112141706.041|20110112141707.276|TR0|than working with the Haitian 
20110112141707.276|20110112141708.510|TR0|government and compelling it to 
20110112141708.510|20110112141709.744|TR0|respond to the needs of its 
20110112141709.744|20110112141710.979|TR0|citizens, in terms of 
20110112141710.979|20110112141712.213|TR0|healthcare, jobs, housing, 
20110112141712.213|20110112141713.448|TR0|education and so on, by 
20110112141713.448|20110112141714.682|TR0|bypassing the state and funding 
20110112141714.682|20110112141715.916|TR0|NGOs directly, it sapped even 
20110112141715.916|20110112141717.151|TR0|further the capacity of the 
20110112141717.151|20110112141718.385|TR0|state to face up to its 
20110112141718.385|20110112141719.620|TR0|responsibilities and weakening 
20110112141719.620|20110112141720.854|TR0|it even further. So, the point 
20110112141720.854|20110112141722.088|TR0|is that - the point I was trying 
20110112141722.088|20110112141723.323|TR0|to make is that the foreign 
20110112141723.323|20110112141724.557|TR0|community has a direct role to 
20110112141724.557|20110112141725.792|TR0|play, in collaboration with the 
20110112141725.792|20110112141727.026|TR0|Haitian elites, to create a 
20110112141727.026|20110112141728.261|TR0|situation in Haiti where the 
20110112141728.261|20110112141729.495|TR0|vast majority of the population 
20110112141729.495|20110112141730.729|TR0|continued to live in poverty, 
20110112141730.729|20110112141731.964|TR0|and their basic needs and their 
20110112141731.964|20110112141733.198|TR0|basic rights are being ignored. 
20110112141733.198|20110112141734.433|TR0|That was the point of the 
20110112141734.433|20110112141735.667|TR0|article.

20110112141738.136|20110112141739.370|TR0|you to stay with us. But when we 
20110112141739.370|20110112141740.605|TR0|come back, we're going to go 
20110112141740.605|20110112141741.839|TR0|directly to Haiti to speak with 
20110112141741.839|20110112141743.073|TR0|Patrick Elie, who we spoke to 
20110112141743.073|20110112141744.308|TR0|when we were last in Haiti six 
20110112141744.308|20110112141745.542|TR0|months ago, a longtime Haitian 
20110112141745.542|20110112141746.777|TR0|democracy activist. We're 
20110112141746.777|20110112141748.011|TR0|speaking with Wesleyan

20110112141800.355|20110112141801.590|TR0|won the equivalent of the 
20110112141801.590|20110112141802.824|TR0|American Idol competition in 
20110112141802.824|20110112141804.058|TR0|Haiti. We saw him when we first 
20110112141804.058|20110112141805.293|TR0|went to Haiti right after the 
20110112141805.293|20110112141806.527|TR0|earthquake. He was traveling 
20110112141806.527|20110112141807.762|TR0|with a large family, making his 
20110112141807.762|20110112141808.996|TR0|way out of Port-au-Prince, 
20110112141808.996|20110112141810.230|TR0|escaping, as so many Haitians 
20110112141810.230|20110112141811.465|TR0|were trying to do, to get away 
20110112141811.465|20110112141812.699|TR0|from the terror. This is

20110112141817.637|20110112141818.871|TR0|It's the first anniversary of 
20110112141818.871|20110112141820.106|TR0|the te tremble, the earth 
20110112141820.106|20110112141821.340|TR0|trembles. That's Creole for the 
20110112141821.340|20110112141822.574|TR0|earthquake. And we go directly 
20110112141822.574|20110112141823.809|TR0|to Port-au-Prince, where we're 
20110112141823.809|20110112141825.043|TR0|joined by Patrick Elie, a 
20110112141825.043|20110112141826.278|TR0|longtime Haitian democracy 
20110112141826.278|20110112141827.512|TR0|activist, Haiti's former

20110112141828.746|20110112141829.981|TR0|Security. He's speaking to us

20110112141831.215|20110112141832.450|TR0|front of the Champ de Mars, just 
20110112141832.450|20110112141833.684|TR0|opposite the National Palace, 
20110112141833.684|20110112141834.919|TR0|where thousands of Haitians 
20110112141834.919|20110112141836.153|TR0|continue to live in a massive 
20110112141836.153|20110112141837.387|TR0|tent camp.
20110112141837.387|20110112141838.622|TR0|
20110112141838.622|20110112141839.856|TR0|It's good to see you again, 
20110112141839.856|20110112141841.091|TR0|Patrick Elie. Can you share your 
20110112141841.091|20110112141842.325|TR0|reflections on this first 
20110112141842.325|20110112141843.559|TR0|anniversary of the earthquake, 
20110112141843.559|20110112141844.794|TR0|especially just where you stand, 
20110112141844.794|20110112141846.028|TR0|what you're looking out over?
20110112141846.028|20110112141847.263|TR0|
20110112141847.263|20110112141848.497|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: Well, I'm 
20110112141848.497|20110112141849.731|TR0|looking at the end of an era, 
20110112141849.731|20110112141850.966|TR0|the end of politics for tens of 
20110112141850.966|20110112141852.200|TR0|years, if not centuries. And I'm 
20110112141852.200|20110112141853.435|TR0|looking at the defeat of that 
20110112141853.435|20110112141854.669|TR0|vision. But I'm also looking at 
20110112141854.669|20110112141855.903|TR0|the incredible will to live that 
20110112141855.903|20110112141857.138|TR0|exists in this country. And to 
20110112141857.138|20110112141858.372|TR0|tell you the truth, even though 
20110112141858.372|20110112141859.607|TR0|I'm sad today, but I'm not 
20110112141859.607|20110112141900.841|TR0|giving up, I'm not discouraged. 
20110112141900.841|20110112141902.075|TR0|And I believe the Haitian people 
20110112141902.075|20110112141903.310|TR0|will once again surprise the 
20110112141903.310|20110112141904.544|TR0|world precisely by its 
20110112141904.544|20110112141905.779|TR0|creativity and its will to live, 
20110112141905.779|20110112141907.013|TR0|that is unshakable, even by such 
20110112141907.013|20110112141908.247|TR0|a monstrous earthquake.
20110112141908.247|20110112141909.482|TR0|
20110112141909.482|20110112141910.716|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: When we last 
20110112141910.716|20110112141911.951|TR0|spoke, we were standing on the 
20110112141911.951|20110112141913.185|TR0|rubble of the Montana Hotel, 
20110112141913.185|20110112141914.420|TR0|where people were buried 
20110112141914.420|20110112141915.654|TR0|underneath. You're standing in 
20110112141915.654|20110112141916.888|TR0|front of the Champ de Mars. 
20110112141916.888|20110112141918.123|TR0|Thousands of people remain 
20110112141918.123|20110112141919.357|TR0|there. I think this is very hard 
20110112141919.357|20110112141920.592|TR0|for people outside of Haiti to 
20110112141920.592|20110112141921.826|TR0|understand how still a million 
20110112141921.826|20110112141923.060|TR0|people are displaced in Haiti, 
20110112141923.060|20110112141924.295|TR0|this after the catastrophe of a 
20110112141924.295|20110112141925.529|TR0|quarter of a million at least 
20110112141925.529|20110112141926.764|TR0|killed, and now you have cholera 
20110112141926.764|20110112141927.998|TR0|on top of this. What has 
20110112141927.998|20110112141929.232|TR0|happened in this year?
20110112141929.232|20110112141930.467|TR0|
20110112141930.467|20110112141931.701|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: Yes.
20110112141931.701|20110112141932.936|TR0|
20110112141932.936|20110112141934.170|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Why hasn't aid 
20110112141934.170|20110112141935.404|TR0|come, Patrick?
20110112141935.404|20110112141936.639|TR0|
20110112141936.639|20110112141937.873|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: Well, first of 
20110112141937.873|20110112141939.108|TR0|all, you know, you were dealing 
20110112141939.108|20110112141940.342|TR0|with a country that was in very 
20110112141940.342|20110112141941.576|TR0|bad shape to start with. And you 
20110112141941.576|20110112141942.811|TR0|were dealing with a state that 
20110112141942.811|20110112141944.045|TR0|was weak for the mission it must 
20110112141944.045|20110112141945.280|TR0|execute. And the earthquake - 
20110112141945.280|20110112141946.514|TR0|and paradoxically, the outpour 
20110112141946.514|20110112141947.749|TR0|of solidarity - has not made 
20110112141947.749|20110112141948.983|TR0|things better in terms of the 
20110112141948.983|20110112141950.217|TR0|ability and the will of the 
20110112141950.217|20110112141951.452|TR0|state to rise up to the 
20110112141951.452|20110112141952.686|TR0|challenge. So, of course, one 
20110112141952.686|20110112141953.921|TR0|year later, I believe everybody 
20110112141953.921|20110112141955.155|TR0|would have expected to see 
20110112141955.155|20110112141956.389|TR0|better result, a more pronounced 
20110112141956.389|20110112141957.624|TR0|improvement of the situation. 
20110112141957.624|20110112141958.858|TR0|But really what I'm seeing is, 
20110112141958.858|20110112142000.093|TR0|if you want, question me, but 
20110112142000.093|20110112142001.327|TR0|it's not at all as bad as it is 
20110112142001.327|20110112142002.561|TR0|usually described. I don't 
20110112142002.561|20110112142003.796|TR0|think, truly, that the Haitian 
20110112142003.796|20110112142005.030|TR0|people have to be pitied or 
20110112142005.030|20110112142006.265|TR0|mourned. They have to get true 
20110112142006.265|20110112142007.499|TR0|solidarity in their endeavor to 
20110112142007.499|20110112142008.733|TR0|rebuild, and not to rebuild the 
20110112142008.733|20110112142009.968|TR0|same.
20110112142009.968|20110112142011.202|TR0|
20110112142011.202|20110112142012.437|TR0|You know, Port-au-Prince is a 
20110112142012.437|20110112142013.671|TR0|city, and a city is a living 
20110112142013.671|20110112142014.905|TR0|organism. And Port-au-Prince, as 
20110112142014.905|20110112142016.140|TR0|we speak, is trying to relive 
20110112142016.140|20110112142017.374|TR0|the same way it was, and that 
20110112142017.374|20110112142018.609|TR0|would be a catastrophe for the 
20110112142018.609|20110112142019.843|TR0|country. Port-au-Prince has been 
20110112142019.843|20110112142021.078|TR0|strangling the rest of this 
20110112142021.078|20110112142022.312|TR0|nation, the rest of this 
20110112142022.312|20110112142023.546|TR0|country, for decades. It's time, 
20110112142023.546|20110112142024.781|TR0|after the earthquake, to 
20110112142024.781|20110112142026.015|TR0|question the whole vision of how 
20110112142026.015|20110112142027.250|TR0|Haiti was built. It is time, if 
20110112142027.250|20110112142028.484|TR0|you want, to - I don't want to 
20110112142028.484|20110112142029.718|TR0|say to destroy Port-au-Prince, 
20110112142029.718|20110112142030.953|TR0|but to put it in its right place 
20110112142030.953|20110112142032.187|TR0|in this country. We must resist 
20110112142032.187|20110112142033.422|TR0|the impulse to rebuild 
20110112142033.422|20110112142034.656|TR0|Port-au-Prince the way it was: a 
20110112142034.656|20110112142035.890|TR0|city of exclusion, of 
20110112142035.890|20110112142037.125|TR0|hyper-concentration and of 
20110112142037.125|20110112142038.359|TR0|shanty towns, which, if you 
20110112142038.359|20110112142039.594|TR0|want, contributed very, very 
20110112142039.594|20110112142040.828|TR0|much to the high toll that we've 
20110112142040.828|20110112142042.062|TR0|paid after the earthquake. So, 
20110112142042.062|20110112142043.297|TR0|we definitely have to break away 
20110112142043.297|20110112142044.531|TR0|from the course we seem to have 
20110112142044.531|20110112142045.766|TR0|been taken, which has been to do 
20110112142045.766|20110112142047.000|TR0|more of the same. We must do 
20110112142047.000|20110112142048.234|TR0|that; otherwise, it's going to 
20110112142048.234|20110112142049.469|TR0|be worse than before.

20110112142050.703|20110112142051.938|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Who controls 
20110112142051.938|20110112142053.172|TR0|Haiti now? Who is in control of 
20110112142053.172|20110112142054.407|TR0|the reconstruction? We were just 
20110112142054.407|20110112142055.641|TR0|speaking with Professor Alex 
20110112142055.641|20110112142056.875|TR0|Dupuy, who talked about the 
20110112142056.875|20110112142058.110|TR0|IHRC, the Interim Haiti Recovery 
20110112142058.110|20110112142059.344|TR0|Commission, co-chaired by Bill 
20110112142059.344|20110112142100.579|TR0|Clinton and the Haitian prime 
20110112142100.579|20110112142101.813|TR0|minister Jean-Max Bellerive.
20110112142101.813|20110112142103.047|TR0|
20110112142103.047|20110112142104.282|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: I believe that 
20110112142104.282|20110112142105.516|TR0|at the moment Haiti is 
20110112142105.516|20110112142106.751|TR0|controlled by a foreign 
20110112142106.751|20110112142107.985|TR0|government and foreign 
20110112142107.985|20110112142109.219|TR0|interests, the so-called 
20110112142109.219|20110112142110.454|TR0|international community. And I'm 
20110112142110.454|20110112142111.688|TR0|afraid that in the month or 
20110112142111.688|20110112142112.923|TR0|maybe years to come, it's going 
20110112142112.923|20110112142114.157|TR0|to get even worse, because, as 
20110112142114.157|20110112142115.391|TR0|you know, the election did not, 
20110112142115.391|20110112142116.626|TR0|if you want, mobilize the 
20110112142116.626|20110112142117.860|TR0|Haitian people, and whoever gets 
20110112142117.860|20110112142119.095|TR0|elected is going to be a very 
20110112142119.095|20110112142120.329|TR0|weak government, very weak 
20110112142120.329|20110112142121.563|TR0|president, with very little 
20110112142121.563|20110112142122.798|TR0|popular legitimacy. So, the 
20110112142122.798|20110112142124.032|TR0|ability of this new leadership 
20110112142124.032|20110112142125.267|TR0|to actually mobilize Haitians 
20110112142125.267|20110112142126.501|TR0|for reconstruction and be able 
20110112142126.501|20110112142127.735|TR0|to engage the international 
20110112142127.735|20110112142128.970|TR0|community on a 
20110112142128.970|20110112142130.204|TR0|partner-to-partner basis is 
20110112142130.204|20110112142131.439|TR0|going to be very, very small.
20110112142131.439|20110112142132.673|TR0|
20110112142132.673|20110112142133.908|TR0|So, it's going to take time, but 
20110112142133.908|20110112142135.142|TR0|I do believe that the earthquake 
20110112142135.142|20110112142136.376|TR0|is also a signal for us to build 
20110112142136.376|20110112142137.611|TR0|Haitian democracy on sound 
20110112142137.611|20110112142138.845|TR0|foundations, which means the 
20110112142138.845|20110112142140.080|TR0|neighborhood committees, the 
20110112142140.080|20110112142141.314|TR0|grassroot organization, instead 
20110112142141.314|20110112142142.548|TR0|of trying to build a democracy 
20110112142142.548|20110112142143.783|TR0|from the top down. That's how we 
20110112142143.783|20110112142145.017|TR0|built our houses in 
20110112142145.017|20110112142146.252|TR0|Port-au-Prince, and you saw what 
20110112142146.252|20110112142147.486|TR0|happened. So, I believe it's 
20110112142147.486|20110112142148.720|TR0|time for serious soul searching 
20110112142148.720|20110112142149.955|TR0|for the nation and to do an 
20110112142149.955|20110112142151.189|TR0|assessment of what has been the 
20110112142151.189|20110112142152.424|TR0|latest episode in Haiti's search 
20110112142152.424|20110112142153.658|TR0|for democracy, which has lasted 
20110112142153.658|20110112142154.892|TR0|at least a quarter of a century 
20110112142154.892|20110112142156.127|TR0|with very poor result, as we 
20110112142156.127|20110112142157.361|TR0|speak.

20110112142158.596|20110112142159.830|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to 
20110112142159.830|20110112142201.064|TR0|bring in Jean Saint-Vil and then 
20110112142201.064|20110112142202.299|TR0|get your response, Patrick Elie. 
20110112142202.299|20110112142203.533|TR0|We're turning to Canada. He's in 
20110112142203.533|20110112142204.768|TR0|Ottawa, the Haitian writer and 
20110112142204.768|20110112142206.002|TR0|activist, his website,

20110112142208.471|20110112142209.705|TR0|On this first anniversary of the 
20110112142209.705|20110112142210.940|TR0|earthquake that killed hundreds 
20110112142210.940|20110112142212.174|TR0|of thousands of people, now more 
20110112142212.174|20110112142213.409|TR0|than a million - and the country 
20110112142213.409|20110112142214.643|TR0|is only 10 million people - and 
20110112142214.643|20110112142215.877|TR0|cholera ravaging through the 
20110112142215.877|20110112142217.112|TR0|country, Jean Saint-Vil, your 
20110112142217.112|20110112142218.346|TR0|thoughts?
20110112142218.346|20110112142219.581|TR0|
20110112142219.581|20110112142220.815|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL: Well, I was 
20110112142220.815|20110112142222.049|TR0|listening attentively to Alex 
20110112142222.049|20110112142223.284|TR0|Dupuy and Patrick, and they've 
20110112142223.284|20110112142224.518|TR0|really covered a lot of my 
20110112142224.518|20110112142225.753|TR0|thoughts. And I think one of the 
20110112142225.753|20110112142226.987|TR0|things that is common in what 
20110112142226.987|20110112142228.221|TR0|they've said is that there is 
20110112142228.221|20110112142229.456|TR0|not evidence that we've made 
20110112142229.456|20110112142230.690|TR0|that shift. Patrick mentioned 
20110112142230.690|20110112142231.925|TR0|that Port-au-Prince is trying to 
20110112142231.925|20110112142233.159|TR0|rebuild itself on the same 
20110112142233.159|20110112142234.393|TR0|principle that it had built 
20110112142234.393|20110112142235.628|TR0|itself before and is - has 
20110112142235.628|20110112142236.862|TR0|collapsed. The same thing with 
20110112142236.862|20110112142238.097|TR0|the way Alex Dupuy described the 
20110112142238.097|20110112142239.331|TR0|international community.
20110112142239.331|20110112142240.566|TR0|
20110112142240.566|20110112142241.800|TR0|I think that another Haitian 
20110112142241.800|20110112142243.034|TR0|author described it pretty well: 
20110112142243.034|20110112142244.269|TR0|Edwidge Danticat, who published 
20110112142244.269|20110112142245.503|TR0|in the Miami Herald earlier this 
20110112142245.503|20110112142246.738|TR0|week an article titled "Haitians 
20110112142246.738|20110112142247.972|TR0|Are Tired, But We Are Not 
20110112142247.972|20110112142249.206|TR0|Defeated." I would add that we 
20110112142249.206|20110112142250.441|TR0|are sick and tired, but not 
20110112142250.441|20110112142251.675|TR0|defeated. As you mentioned, we 
20110112142251.675|20110112142252.910|TR0|have lost more than 3,700 
20110112142252.910|20110112142254.144|TR0|Haitians through the cholera 
20110112142254.144|20110112142255.378|TR0|brought to Haiti by U.N. troops.
20110112142255.378|20110112142256.613|TR0|
20110112142256.613|20110112142257.847|TR0|And what we are seeing is, 
20110112142257.847|20110112142259.082|TR0|instead of resources being 
20110112142259.082|20110112142300.316|TR0|mobilized to deal with 
20110112142300.316|20110112142301.550|TR0|protecting human lives, building 
20110112142301.550|20110112142302.785|TR0|infrastructures for a new Haiti, 
20110112142302.785|20110112142304.019|TR0|instead we're seeing the 
20110112142304.019|20110112142305.254|TR0|international community, which 
20110112142305.254|20110112142306.488|TR0|includes the United Nations, 
20110112142306.488|20110112142307.722|TR0|mobilizing resources to maintain 
20110112142307.722|20110112142308.957|TR0|the status quo. So, my 
20110112142308.957|20110112142310.191|TR0|perspective on this is that one 
20110112142310.191|20110112142311.426|TR0|year after the earthquake, we 
20110112142311.426|20110112142312.660|TR0|are seeing the Haitian 
20110112142312.660|20110112142313.894|TR0|population being treated and 
20110112142313.894|20110112142315.129|TR0|seen as a threat, rather than as 
20110112142315.129|20110112142316.363|TR0|an asset. And to me, that's the 
20110112142316.363|20110112142317.598|TR0|major paradigm shift that must 
20110112142317.598|20110112142318.832|TR0|occur if we have to get out of 
20110112142318.832|20110112142320.067|TR0|this mess.
20110112142320.067|20110112142321.301|TR0|
20110112142321.301|20110112142322.535|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask 
20110112142322.535|20110112142323.770|TR0|you, Alex Dupuy, before we go 
20110112142323.770|20110112142325.004|TR0|back to Port-au-Prince with 
20110112142325.004|20110112142326.239|TR0|Patrick Elie, about the U.S. 
20110112142326.239|20110112142327.473|TR0|official who was in charge of 
20110112142327.473|20110112142328.707|TR0|relief efforts following Haiti's 
20110112142328.707|20110112142329.942|TR0|devastating earthquake who has 
20110112142329.942|20110112142331.176|TR0|accused a major contractor of 
20110112142331.176|20110112142332.411|TR0|shortchanging him for his 
20110112142332.411|20110112142333.645|TR0|assistance in securing more than 
20110112142333.645|20110112142334.879|TR0|$20 million in reconstruction 
20110112142334.879|20110112142336.114|TR0|deals. It was the Haiti Recovery 
20110112142336.114|20110112142337.348|TR0|Group he's suing, and it was 
20110112142337.348|20110112142338.583|TR0|Lewis Lucke that the Associated 
20110112142338.583|20110112142339.817|TR0|Press was reporting on.
20110112142339.817|20110112142341.051|TR0|
20110112142341.051|20110112142342.286|TR0|>> ALEX DUPUY: Well, I don't 
20110112142342.286|20110112142343.520|TR0|know all the specifics of that 
20110112142343.520|20110112142344.755|TR0|suit, but what is known is that, 
20110112142344.755|20110112142345.989|TR0|of the contracts that have been 
20110112142345.989|20110112142347.223|TR0|given out by the Interim Haiti 
20110112142347.223|20110112142348.458|TR0|Recovery Commission, most of 
20110112142348.458|20110112142349.692|TR0|those contracts have gone to 
20110112142349.692|20110112142350.927|TR0|U.S. firms. Only two of them 
20110112142350.927|20110112142352.161|TR0|went to Haitian firms. And a 
20110112142352.161|20110112142353.396|TR0|significant percentage of the 
20110112142353.396|20110112142354.630|TR0|contracts that went to U.S. 
20110112142354.630|20110112142355.864|TR0|firms went to two firms, 
20110112142355.864|20110112142357.099|TR0|according to news reports, with 
20110112142357.099|20110112142358.333|TR0|no-bid contracts. So, I am not 
20110112142358.333|20110112142359.568|TR0|sure if this is what the suit is 
20110112142359.568|20110112142400.802|TR0|targeting, but -
20110112142400.802|20110112142402.036|TR0|
20110112142402.036|20110112142403.271|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask - let 
20110112142403.271|20110112142404.505|TR0|me ask Jean Saint-Vil. Are you 
20110112142404.505|20110112142405.740|TR0|familiar with this case?
20110112142405.740|20110112142406.974|TR0|
20110112142406.974|20110112142408.208|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL: Yes, I have 
20110112142408.208|20110112142409.443|TR0|read the report on the web about 
20110112142409.443|20110112142410.677|TR0|this. And if I am not mistaken, 
20110112142410.677|20110112142411.912|TR0|Mr. Lewis Lucke is actually a 
20110112142411.912|20110112142413.146|TR0|former U.S. ambassador to 
20110112142413.146|20110112142414.380|TR0|Swaziland, and he was working 
20110112142414.380|20110112142415.615|TR0|with the USAID in Haiti. And 
20110112142415.615|20110112142416.849|TR0|he's suing the Haitian company 
20110112142416.849|20110112142418.084|TR0|led by Bigio, the Bigio Group 
20110112142418.084|20110112142419.318|TR0|[GB Group], which - actually, 
20110112142419.318|20110112142420.552|TR0|Bigio is described as the 
20110112142420.552|20110112142421.787|TR0|richest man in Haiti, part of 
20110112142421.787|20110112142423.021|TR0|the small Haitian elite that 
20110112142423.021|20110112142424.256|TR0|controls basically the economic 
20110112142424.256|20110112142425.490|TR0|life of Haiti. What's 
20110112142425.490|20110112142426.725|TR0|interesting in this article is 
20110112142426.725|20110112142427.959|TR0|that it's describing that the 
20110112142427.959|20110112142429.193|TR0|work that Lewis Lucke has done 
20110112142429.193|20110112142430.428|TR0|is really lobbying former U.S. 
20110112142430.428|20110112142431.662|TR0|presidents Bill Clinton and 
20110112142431.662|20110112142432.897|TR0|George Bush for contracts that 
20110112142432.897|20110112142434.131|TR0|he was securing for American 
20110112142434.131|20110112142435.365|TR0|companies. To me, this is an 
20110112142435.365|20110112142436.600|TR0|example of exactly what is wrong 
20110112142436.600|20110112142437.834|TR0|with the current model, where 
20110112142437.834|20110112142439.069|TR0|non-Haitians have more power 
20110112142439.069|20110112142440.303|TR0|than Haitian leaders in Haiti, 
20110112142440.303|20110112142441.537|TR0|and the corruption that has been 
20110112142441.537|20110112142442.772|TR0|treated in Haiti as if it was, 
20110112142442.772|20110112142444.006|TR0|you know, a genetic disease that 
20110112142444.006|20110112142445.241|TR0|only affects the Haitian players.
20110112142445.241|20110112142446.475|TR0|
20110112142446.475|20110112142447.709|TR0|We are seeing that the IHRC, led 
20110112142447.709|20110112142448.944|TR0|by Bill Clinton and Jean-Max 
20110112142448.944|20110112142450.178|TR0|Bellerive, is actually only led 
20110112142450.178|20110112142451.413|TR0|by the international players. 
20110112142451.413|20110112142452.647|TR0|People have actually been 
20110112142452.647|20110112142453.881|TR0|asking, "Where is the Haitian 
20110112142453.881|20110112142455.116|TR0|prime minister, Jean-Max 
20110112142455.116|20110112142456.350|TR0|Bellerive?" At the last meeting 
20110112142456.350|20110112142457.585|TR0|that took place in Dominican 
20110112142457.585|20110112142458.819|TR0|Republic, he wasn't even there. 
20110112142458.819|20110112142500.053|TR0|And that's where the 12 members 
20110112142500.053|20110112142501.288|TR0|of the Haitian participants in 
20110112142501.288|20110112142502.522|TR0|this commission were saying that 
20110112142502.522|20110112142503.757|TR0|contracts are being signed, 
20110112142503.757|20110112142504.991|TR0|major decisions are being made, 
20110112142504.991|20110112142506.226|TR0|without them being involved. So, 
20110112142506.226|20110112142507.460|TR0|basically, the Clinton Global 
20110112142507.460|20110112142508.694|TR0|Initiative and Bill Clinton 
20110112142508.694|20110112142509.929|TR0|himself, not to talk about all 
20110112142509.929|20110112142511.163|TR0|the conflict of interest being 
20110112142511.163|20110112142512.398|TR0|the husband of the U.S. 
20110112142512.398|20110112142513.632|TR0|Secretary of State - I mean, 
20110112142513.632|20110112142514.866|TR0|Haiti is not being led by 
20110112142514.866|20110112142516.101|TR0|Haitians, and that's basically 
20110112142516.101|20110112142517.335|TR0|what's been wrong with the 
20110112142517.335|20110112142518.570|TR0|situation since 2004.
20110112142518.570|20110112142519.804|TR0|
20110112142519.804|20110112142521.038|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Patrick Elie, I 
20110112142521.038|20110112142522.273|TR0|want to come back to you, as you 
20110112142522.273|20110112142523.507|TR0|stand there in front of the 
20110112142523.507|20110112142524.742|TR0|Champ de Mars, where so many 
20110112142524.742|20110112142525.976|TR0|people remain in these refugee 
20110112142525.976|20110112142527.210|TR0|camps. And I was wondering if 
20110112142527.210|20110112142528.445|TR0|you could give us a history 
20110112142528.445|20110112142529.679|TR0|lesson, for those not familiar 
20110112142529.679|20110112142530.914|TR0|with Haiti, in its birth out of 
20110112142530.914|20110112142532.148|TR0|a slave rebellion, and then what 
20110112142532.148|20110112142533.382|TR0|you think needs to happen right 
20110112142533.382|20110112142534.617|TR0|now concretely on the ground, as 
20110112142534.617|20110112142535.851|TR0|you say your country is being 
20110112142535.851|20110112142537.086|TR0|controlled by foreign interests, 
20110112142537.086|20110112142538.320|TR0|by foreign governments.
20110112142538.320|20110112142539.555|TR0|
20110112142539.555|20110112142540.789|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: It is indeed a 
20110112142540.789|20110112142542.023|TR0|huge challenge that we're facing 
20110112142542.023|20110112142543.258|TR0|as a people, maybe as big as the 
20110112142543.258|20110112142544.492|TR0|one we did face successfully in 
20110112142544.492|20110112142545.727|TR0|1804. And as for, if you want, 
20110112142545.727|20110112142546.961|TR0|the vultures descending on 
20110112142546.961|20110112142548.195|TR0|Haiti, I believe we evoked that 
20110112142548.195|20110112142549.430|TR0|the last time we met on the 
20110112142549.430|20110112142550.664|TR0|Montana. And the only people 
20110112142550.664|20110112142551.899|TR0|that can prevent that are the 
20110112142551.899|20110112142553.133|TR0|Haitians themselves, with the 
20110112142553.133|20110112142554.367|TR0|help of foreign friends that 
20110112142554.367|20110112142555.602|TR0|keep their vigilance high, 
20110112142555.602|20110112142556.836|TR0|because, you know, things are 
20110112142556.836|20110112142558.071|TR0|going on that are beyond the 
20110112142558.071|20110112142559.305|TR0|back of the people of the world 
20110112142559.305|20110112142600.539|TR0|that were so generous toward 
20110112142600.539|20110112142601.774|TR0|Haiti and beyond the back of the 
20110112142601.774|20110112142603.008|TR0|Haitian people. And really what 
20110112142603.008|20110112142604.243|TR0|needs to be done is not easy to 
20110112142604.243|20110112142605.477|TR0|map out. To tell you the truth, 
20110112142605.477|20110112142606.711|TR0|there is no magic wand.
20110112142606.711|20110112142607.946|TR0|
20110112142607.946|20110112142609.180|TR0|A lot of the people you see out 
20110112142609.180|20110112142610.415|TR0|in the Champ de Mars, they were 
20110112142610.415|20110112142611.649|TR0|not living any better before in 
20110112142611.649|20110112142612.884|TR0|Cite Soleil and in the different 
20110112142612.884|20110112142614.118|TR0|shanty towns. The difference is 
20110112142614.118|20110112142615.352|TR0|that now they're making their 
20110112142615.352|20110112142616.587|TR0|presence known, they're in your 
20110112142616.587|20110112142617.821|TR0|face, so to speak. And I hope 
20110112142617.821|20110112142619.056|TR0|that they will be able to show 
20110112142619.056|20110112142620.290|TR0|both the world outside and the 
20110112142620.290|20110112142621.524|TR0|Haitian elite that things have 
20110112142621.524|20110112142622.759|TR0|to change. And in a way - and I 
20110112142622.759|20110112142623.993|TR0|measure my words - to see these 
20110112142623.993|20110112142625.228|TR0|people in the Champ de Mars 
20110112142625.228|20110112142626.462|TR0|right smack in front of the

20110112142627.696|20110112142628.931|TR0|message. It has to remind anyone 
20110112142628.931|20110112142630.165|TR0|who find itself in this ruin of 
20110112142630.165|20110112142631.400|TR0|a building, anyone who is living 
20110112142631.400|20110112142632.634|TR0|in a five million U.S.-dollar 
20110112142632.634|20110112142633.868|TR0|mansion, that these are 
20110112142633.868|20110112142635.103|TR0|Haitians, and they have to be, 
20110112142635.103|20110112142636.337|TR0|if you want, enfranchised and 
20110112142636.337|20110112142637.572|TR0|that their needs and their 
20110112142637.572|20110112142638.806|TR0|demands have to be met. So, you 
20110112142638.806|20110112142640.040|TR0|know, as they say in Haiti, 
20110112142640.040|20110112142641.275|TR0|"C'est un bien pour un mal," 
20110112142641.275|20110112142642.509|TR0|we've exchanged an evil for a 
20110112142642.509|20110112142643.744|TR0|message that had to be heard for 
20110112142643.744|20110112142644.978|TR0|years and years.

20110112142646.212|20110112142647.447|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What, at this 
20110112142647.447|20110112142648.681|TR0|point, do you feel needs to be 
20110112142648.681|20110112142649.916|TR0|done? Do you feel that the IHRC, 
20110112142649.916|20110112142651.150|TR0|that is run by President 
20110112142651.150|20110112142652.385|TR0|Clinton, former President 
20110112142652.385|20110112142653.619|TR0|Clinton, and Bellerive, should 
20110112142653.619|20110112142654.853|TR0|it continue? Should it be 
20110112142654.853|20110112142656.088|TR0|dismantled? You talk about a 
20110112142656.088|20110112142657.322|TR0|community organizations that 
20110112142657.322|20110112142658.557|TR0|could rise up, a changing of 
20110112142658.557|20110112142659.791|TR0|Port-au-Prince, but how will 
20110112142659.791|20110112142701.025|TR0|this actually happen?
20110112142701.025|20110112142702.260|TR0|
20110112142702.260|20110112142703.494|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: I do believe 
20110112142703.494|20110112142704.729|TR0|that we need something different 
20110112142704.729|20110112142705.963|TR0|from the Haitian state as it is, 
20110112142705.963|20110112142707.197|TR0|and as it will emerge from this 
20110112142707.197|20110112142708.432|TR0|election, to lead the effort in 
20110112142708.432|20110112142709.666|TR0|reconstruction. Obviously, there 
20110112142709.666|20110112142710.901|TR0|has to be parliamentary 
20110112142710.901|20110112142712.135|TR0|representative of the donors, 
20110112142712.135|20110112142713.369|TR0|but mostly the Haitian 
20110112142713.369|20110112142714.604|TR0|representation should reflect 
20110112142714.604|20110112142715.838|TR0|more the Haitian community as it 
20110112142715.838|20110112142717.073|TR0|is. It's not enough to have 
20110112142717.073|20110112142718.307|TR0|big-shot lawyers and 
20110112142718.307|20110112142719.541|TR0|technicians. The voice of the 
20110112142719.541|20110112142720.776|TR0|communities, both of 
20110112142720.776|20110112142722.010|TR0|Port-au-Prince but also in the 
20110112142722.010|20110112142723.245|TR0|other parts of the country, 
20110112142723.245|20110112142724.479|TR0|which represent our way out of 
20110112142724.479|20110112142725.714|TR0|this mess, their voices have to 
20110112142725.714|20110112142726.948|TR0|be heard also. And to be frank, 
20110112142726.948|20110112142728.182|TR0|I have not heard those voices 
20110112142728.182|20110112142729.417|TR0|spoken in the reconstruction. 
20110112142729.417|20110112142730.651|TR0|So, for me, personally, one of 
20110112142730.651|20110112142731.886|TR0|the very encouraging things that 
20110112142731.886|20110112142733.120|TR0|emerged from the earthquake was 
20110112142733.120|20110112142734.354|TR0|the birth, or the rebirth, of 
20110112142734.354|20110112142735.589|TR0|the neighborhood committees. And 
20110112142735.589|20110112142736.823|TR0|many of them, I must admit, you 
20110112142736.823|20110112142738.058|TR0|know, just organized so that 
20110112142738.058|20110112142739.292|TR0|they could profit for the 
20110112142739.292|20110112142740.526|TR0|charity. But some of them have 
20110112142740.526|20110112142741.761|TR0|remained, and they are, if you 
20110112142741.761|20110112142742.995|TR0|want, sketching their way ahead. 
20110112142742.995|20110112142744.230|TR0|And the movement has spread away 
20110112142744.230|20110112142745.464|TR0|from Port-au-Prince and away 
20110112142745.464|20110112142746.698|TR0|from the cities to what we call 
20110112142746.698|20110112142747.933|TR0|the lakou, which are the small 
20110112142747.933|20110112142749.167|TR0|peasant communities. In my 
20110112142749.167|20110112142750.402|TR0|opinion, there lies the future 
20110112142750.402|20110112142751.636|TR0|of Haiti and of its democracy, 
20110112142751.636|20110112142752.870|TR0|not up in the fancy hotel or the 
20110112142752.870|20110112142754.105|TR0|convention centers.

20110112142756.574|20110112142757.808|TR0|want to thank you for being with 
20110112142757.808|20110112142759.043|TR0|us, Haitian democracy activist, 
20110112142759.043|20110112142800.277|TR0|speaking to us from 
20110112142800.277|20110112142801.511|TR0|Port-au-Prince. When we come 
20110112142801.511|20110112142802.746|TR0|back from break, we will go to 
20110112142802.746|20110112142803.980|TR0|Carrefour to speak with the 
20110112142803.980|20110112142805.215|TR0|Haitian writer Edwidge Danticat, 
20110112142805.215|20110112142806.449|TR0|the Haitian American novelist. 
20110112142806.449|20110112142807.683|TR0|Stay with us.

20110112142812.621|20110112142813.855|TR0|won the equivalent of the 
20110112142813.855|20110112142815.090|TR0|American Idol competition in 
20110112142815.090|20110112142816.324|TR0|Haiti. We saw him when we first 
20110112142816.324|20110112142817.559|TR0|went to Haiti right after the 
20110112142817.559|20110112142818.793|TR0|earthquake. He was traveling 
20110112142818.793|20110112142820.027|TR0|with a large family, making his 
20110112142820.027|20110112142821.262|TR0|way out of Port-au-Prince, 
20110112142821.262|20110112142822.496|TR0|escaping, as so many Haitians 
20110112142822.496|20110112142823.731|TR0|were trying to do, to get away 
20110112142823.731|20110112142824.965|TR0|from the terror. This is

20110112142829.903|20110112142831.137|TR0|It's the first anniversary of 
20110112142831.137|20110112142832.371|TR0|the te tremble, the earth 
20110112142832.371|20110112142833.606|TR0|trembles. That's Creole for the 
20110112142833.606|20110112142834.840|TR0|earthquake. And we go directly 
20110112142834.840|20110112142836.075|TR0|to Port-au-Prince, where we're 
20110112142836.075|20110112142837.309|TR0|joined by Patrick Elie, a 
20110112142837.309|20110112142838.544|TR0|longtime Haitian democracy 
20110112142838.544|20110112142839.778|TR0|activist, Haiti's former

20110112142841.012|20110112142842.247|TR0|Security. He's speaking to us 
20110112142842.247|20110112142843.481|TR0|from downtown Port-au-Prince in 
20110112142843.481|20110112142844.716|TR0|front of the Champ de Mars, just 
20110112142844.716|20110112142845.950|TR0|opposite the National Palace, 
20110112142845.950|20110112142847.184|TR0|where thousands of Haitians 
20110112142847.184|20110112142848.419|TR0|continue to live in a massive 
20110112142848.419|20110112142849.653|TR0|tent camp.

20110112142850.888|20110112142852.122|TR0|It's good to see you again, 
20110112142852.122|20110112142853.356|TR0|Patrick Elie. Can you share your 
20110112142853.356|20110112142854.591|TR0|reflections on this first 
20110112142854.591|20110112142855.825|TR0|anniversary of the earthquake, 
20110112142855.825|20110112142857.060|TR0|especially just where you stand, 
20110112142857.060|20110112142858.294|TR0|what you're looking out over?
20110112142858.294|20110112142859.528|TR0|
20110112142859.528|20110112142900.763|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: Well, I'm 
20110112142900.763|20110112142901.997|TR0|looking at the end of an era, 
20110112142901.997|20110112142903.232|TR0|the end of politics for tens of 
20110112142903.232|20110112142904.466|TR0|years, if not centuries. And I'm 
20110112142904.466|20110112142905.700|TR0|looking at the defeat of that 
20110112142905.700|20110112142906.935|TR0|vision. But I'm also looking at 
20110112142906.935|20110112142908.169|TR0|the incredible will to live that 
20110112142908.169|20110112142909.404|TR0|exists in this country. And to 
20110112142909.404|20110112142910.638|TR0|tell you the truth, even though 
20110112142910.638|20110112142911.873|TR0|I'm sad today, but I'm not 
20110112142911.873|20110112142913.107|TR0|giving up, I'm not discouraged. 
20110112142913.107|20110112142914.341|TR0|And I believe the Haitian people 
20110112142914.341|20110112142915.576|TR0|will once again surprise the 
20110112142915.576|20110112142916.810|TR0|world precisely by its 
20110112142916.810|20110112142918.045|TR0|creativity and its will to live, 
20110112142918.045|20110112142919.279|TR0|that is unshakable, even by such 
20110112142919.279|20110112142920.513|TR0|a monstrous earthquake.
20110112142920.513|20110112142921.748|TR0|
20110112142921.748|20110112142922.982|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: When we last 
20110112142922.982|20110112142924.217|TR0|spoke, we were standing on the 
20110112142924.217|20110112142925.451|TR0|rubble of the Montana Hotel, 
20110112142925.451|20110112142926.685|TR0|where people were buried 
20110112142926.685|20110112142927.920|TR0|underneath. You're standing in 
20110112142927.920|20110112142929.154|TR0|front of the Champ de Mars. 
20110112142929.154|20110112142930.389|TR0|Thousands of people remain 
20110112142930.389|20110112142931.623|TR0|there. I think this is very hard 
20110112142931.623|20110112142932.857|TR0|for people outside of Haiti to 
20110112142932.857|20110112142934.092|TR0|understand how still a million 
20110112142934.092|20110112142935.326|TR0|people are displaced in Haiti, 
20110112142935.326|20110112142936.561|TR0|this after the catastrophe of a 
20110112142936.561|20110112142937.795|TR0|quarter of a million at least 
20110112142937.795|20110112142939.029|TR0|killed, and now you have cholera 
20110112142939.029|20110112142940.264|TR0|on top of this. What has 
20110112142940.264|20110112142941.498|TR0|happened in this year?

20110112142947.670|20110112142948.905|TR0|
20110112142948.905|20110112142950.139|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: Well, first of 
20110112142950.139|20110112142951.374|TR0|all, you know, you were dealing 
20110112142951.374|20110112142952.608|TR0|with a country that was in very 
20110112142952.608|20110112142953.842|TR0|bad shape to start with. And you 
20110112142953.842|20110112142955.077|TR0|were dealing with a state that 
20110112142955.077|20110112142956.311|TR0|was weak for the mission it must 
20110112142956.311|20110112142957.546|TR0|execute. And the earthquake - 
20110112142957.546|20110112142958.780|TR0|and paradoxically, the outpour 
20110112142958.780|20110112143000.014|TR0|of solidarity - has not made 
20110112143000.014|20110112143001.249|TR0|things better in terms of the 
20110112143001.249|20110112143002.483|TR0|ability and the will of the 
20110112143002.483|20110112143003.718|TR0|state to rise up to the 
20110112143003.718|20110112143004.952|TR0|challenge. So, of course, one 
20110112143004.952|20110112143006.186|TR0|year later, I believe everybody 
20110112143006.186|20110112143007.421|TR0|would have expected to see 
20110112143007.421|20110112143008.655|TR0|better result, a more pronounced 
20110112143008.655|20110112143009.890|TR0|improvement of the situation. 
20110112143009.890|20110112143011.124|TR0|But really what I'm seeing is, 
20110112143011.124|20110112143012.358|TR0|if you want, question me, but 
20110112143012.358|20110112143013.593|TR0|it's not at all as bad as it is 
20110112143013.593|20110112143014.827|TR0|usually described. I don't 
20110112143014.827|20110112143016.062|TR0|think, truly, that the Haitian 
20110112143016.062|20110112143017.296|TR0|people have to be pitied or 
20110112143017.296|20110112143018.530|TR0|mourned. They have to get true 
20110112143018.530|20110112143019.765|TR0|solidarity in their endeavor to 
20110112143019.765|20110112143020.999|TR0|rebuild, and not to rebuild the 
20110112143020.999|20110112143022.234|TR0|same.
20110112143022.234|20110112143023.468|TR0|
20110112143023.468|20110112143024.703|TR0|You know, Port-au-Prince is a 
20110112143024.703|20110112143025.937|TR0|city, and a city is a living 
20110112143025.937|20110112143027.171|TR0|organism. And Port-au-Prince, as 
20110112143027.171|20110112143028.406|TR0|we speak, is trying to relive 
20110112143028.406|20110112143029.640|TR0|the same way it was, and that 
20110112143029.640|20110112143030.875|TR0|would be a catastrophe for the 
20110112143030.875|20110112143032.109|TR0|country. Port-au-Prince has been 
20110112143032.109|20110112143033.343|TR0|strangling the rest of this 
20110112143033.343|20110112143034.578|TR0|nation, the rest of this 
20110112143034.578|20110112143035.812|TR0|country, for decades. It's time, 
20110112143035.812|20110112143037.047|TR0|after the earthquake, to 
20110112143037.047|20110112143038.281|TR0|question the whole vision of how 
20110112143038.281|20110112143039.515|TR0|Haiti was built. It is time, if 
20110112143039.515|20110112143040.750|TR0|you want, to - I don't want to 
20110112143040.750|20110112143041.984|TR0|say to destroy Port-au-Prince, 
20110112143041.984|20110112143043.219|TR0|but to put it in its right place 
20110112143043.219|20110112143044.453|TR0|in this country. We must resist 
20110112143044.453|20110112143045.687|TR0|the impulse to rebuild 
20110112143045.687|20110112143046.922|TR0|Port-au-Prince the way it was: a 
20110112143046.922|20110112143048.156|TR0|city of exclusion, of 
20110112143048.156|20110112143049.391|TR0|hyper-concentration and of 
20110112143049.391|20110112143050.625|TR0|shanty towns, which, if you 
20110112143050.625|20110112143051.859|TR0|want, contributed very, very 
20110112143051.859|20110112143053.094|TR0|much to the high toll that we've 
20110112143053.094|20110112143054.328|TR0|paid after the earthquake. So, 
20110112143054.328|20110112143055.563|TR0|we definitely have to break away 
20110112143055.563|20110112143056.797|TR0|from the course we seem to have 
20110112143056.797|20110112143058.032|TR0|been taken, which has been to do 
20110112143058.032|20110112143059.266|TR0|more of the same. We must do 
20110112143059.266|20110112143100.500|TR0|that; otherwise, it's going to 
20110112143100.500|20110112143101.735|TR0|be worse than before.

20110112143102.969|20110112143104.204|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Who controls 
20110112143104.204|20110112143105.438|TR0|Haiti now? Who is in control of 
20110112143105.438|20110112143106.672|TR0|the reconstruction? We were just 
20110112143106.672|20110112143107.907|TR0|speaking with Professor Alex 
20110112143107.907|20110112143109.141|TR0|Dupuy, who talked about the 
20110112143109.141|20110112143110.376|TR0|IHRC, the Interim Haiti Recovery 
20110112143110.376|20110112143111.610|TR0|Commission, co-chaired by Bill 
20110112143111.610|20110112143112.844|TR0|Clinton and the Haitian prime 
20110112143112.844|20110112143114.079|TR0|minister Jean-Max Bellerive.
20110112143114.079|20110112143115.313|TR0|
20110112143115.313|20110112143116.548|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: I believe that 
20110112143116.548|20110112143117.782|TR0|at the moment Haiti is 
20110112143117.782|20110112143119.016|TR0|controlled by a foreign 
20110112143119.016|20110112143120.251|TR0|government and foreign 
20110112143120.251|20110112143121.485|TR0|interests, the so-called 
20110112143121.485|20110112143122.720|TR0|international community. And I'm 
20110112143122.720|20110112143123.954|TR0|afraid that in the month or 
20110112143123.954|20110112143125.188|TR0|maybe years to come, it's going 
20110112143125.188|20110112143126.423|TR0|to get even worse, because, as 
20110112143126.423|20110112143127.657|TR0|you know, the election did not, 
20110112143127.657|20110112143128.892|TR0|if you want, mobilize the 
20110112143128.892|20110112143130.126|TR0|Haitian people, and whoever gets 
20110112143130.126|20110112143131.361|TR0|elected is going to be a very 
20110112143131.361|20110112143132.595|TR0|weak government, very weak 
20110112143132.595|20110112143133.829|TR0|president, with very little 
20110112143133.829|20110112143135.064|TR0|popular legitimacy. So, the 
20110112143135.064|20110112143136.298|TR0|ability of this new leadership 
20110112143136.298|20110112143137.533|TR0|to actually mobilize Haitians 
20110112143137.533|20110112143138.767|TR0|for reconstruction and be able 
20110112143138.767|20110112143140.001|TR0|to engage the international 
20110112143140.001|20110112143141.236|TR0|community on a 
20110112143141.236|20110112143142.470|TR0|partner-to-partner basis is 
20110112143142.470|20110112143143.705|TR0|going to be very, very small.
20110112143143.705|20110112143144.939|TR0|
20110112143144.939|20110112143146.173|TR0|So, it's going to take time, but 
20110112143146.173|20110112143147.408|TR0|I do believe that the earthquake 
20110112143147.408|20110112143148.642|TR0|is also a signal for us to build 
20110112143148.642|20110112143149.877|TR0|Haitian democracy on sound 
20110112143149.877|20110112143151.111|TR0|foundations, which means the 
20110112143151.111|20110112143152.345|TR0|neighborhood committees, the 
20110112143152.345|20110112143153.580|TR0|grassroot organization, instead 
20110112143153.580|20110112143154.814|TR0|of trying to build a democracy 
20110112143154.814|20110112143156.049|TR0|from the top down. That's how we 
20110112143156.049|20110112143157.283|TR0|built our houses in 
20110112143157.283|20110112143158.517|TR0|Port-au-Prince, and you saw what 
20110112143158.517|20110112143159.752|TR0|happened. So, I believe it's 
20110112143159.752|20110112143200.986|TR0|time for serious soul searching 
20110112143200.986|20110112143202.221|TR0|for the nation and to do an 
20110112143202.221|20110112143203.455|TR0|assessment of what has been the 
20110112143203.455|20110112143204.690|TR0|latest episode in Haiti's search 
20110112143204.690|20110112143205.924|TR0|for democracy, which has lasted 
20110112143205.924|20110112143207.158|TR0|at least a quarter of a century 
20110112143207.158|20110112143208.393|TR0|with very poor result, as we 
20110112143208.393|20110112143209.627|TR0|speak.

20110112143214.565|20110112143215.799|TR0|We're turning to Canada. He's in

20110112143221.971|20110112143223.206|TR0|earthquake that killed hundreds 
20110112143223.206|20110112143224.440|TR0|of thousands of people, now more 
20110112143224.440|20110112143225.674|TR0|than a million - and the country 
20110112143225.674|20110112143226.909|TR0|is only 10 million people - and 
20110112143226.909|20110112143228.143|TR0|cholera ravaging through the 
20110112143228.143|20110112143229.378|TR0|country, Jean Saint-Vil, your 
20110112143229.378|20110112143230.612|TR0|thoughts?
20110112143230.612|20110112143231.846|TR0|
20110112143231.846|20110112143233.081|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL: Well, I was 
20110112143233.081|20110112143234.315|TR0|listening attentively to Alex 
20110112143234.315|20110112143235.550|TR0|Dupuy and Patrick, and they've 
20110112143235.550|20110112143236.784|TR0|really covered a lot of my 
20110112143236.784|20110112143238.018|TR0|thoughts. And I think one of the 
20110112143238.018|20110112143239.253|TR0|things that is common in what 
20110112143239.253|20110112143240.487|TR0|they've said is that there is 
20110112143240.487|20110112143241.722|TR0|not evidence that we've made 
20110112143241.722|20110112143242.956|TR0|that shift. Patrick mentioned 
20110112143242.956|20110112143244.191|TR0|that Port-au-Prince is trying to 
20110112143244.191|20110112143245.425|TR0|rebuild itself on the same 
20110112143245.425|20110112143246.659|TR0|principle that it had built 
20110112143246.659|20110112143247.894|TR0|itself before and is - has 
20110112143247.894|20110112143249.128|TR0|collapsed. The same thing with 
20110112143249.128|20110112143250.363|TR0|the way Alex Dupuy described the 
20110112143250.363|20110112143251.597|TR0|international community.
20110112143251.597|20110112143252.831|TR0|
20110112143252.831|20110112143254.066|TR0|I think that another Haitian 
20110112143254.066|20110112143255.300|TR0|author described it pretty well: 
20110112143255.300|20110112143256.535|TR0|Edwidge Danticat, who published 
20110112143256.535|20110112143257.769|TR0|in the Miami Herald earlier this 
20110112143257.769|20110112143259.003|TR0|week an article titled "Haitians 
20110112143259.003|20110112143300.238|TR0|Are Tired, But We Are Not 
20110112143300.238|20110112143301.472|TR0|Defeated." I would add that we 
20110112143301.472|20110112143302.707|TR0|are sick and tired, but not 
20110112143302.707|20110112143303.941|TR0|defeated. As you mentioned, we 
20110112143303.941|20110112143305.175|TR0|have lost more than 3,700 
20110112143305.175|20110112143306.410|TR0|Haitians through the cholera 
20110112143306.410|20110112143307.644|TR0|brought to Haiti by U.N. troops.
20110112143307.644|20110112143308.879|TR0|
20110112143308.879|20110112143310.113|TR0|And what we are seeing is, 
20110112143310.113|20110112143311.347|TR0|instead of resources being 
20110112143311.347|20110112143312.582|TR0|mobilized to deal with 
20110112143312.582|20110112143313.816|TR0|protecting human lives, building 
20110112143313.816|20110112143315.051|TR0|infrastructures for a new Haiti, 
20110112143315.051|20110112143316.285|TR0|instead we're seeing the 
20110112143316.285|20110112143317.520|TR0|international community, which 
20110112143317.520|20110112143318.754|TR0|includes the United Nations, 
20110112143318.754|20110112143319.988|TR0|mobilizing resources to maintain 
20110112143319.988|20110112143321.223|TR0|the status quo. So, my 
20110112143321.223|20110112143322.457|TR0|perspective on this is that one 
20110112143322.457|20110112143323.692|TR0|year after the earthquake, we 
20110112143323.692|20110112143324.926|TR0|are seeing the Haitian 
20110112143324.926|20110112143326.160|TR0|population being treated and 
20110112143326.160|20110112143327.395|TR0|seen as a threat, rather than as 
20110112143327.395|20110112143328.629|TR0|an asset. And to me, that's the 
20110112143328.629|20110112143329.864|TR0|major paradigm shift that must 
20110112143329.864|20110112143331.098|TR0|occur if we have to get out of 
20110112143331.098|20110112143332.332|TR0|this mess.
20110112143332.332|20110112143333.567|TR0|
20110112143333.567|20110112143334.801|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask 
20110112143334.801|20110112143336.036|TR0|you, Alex Dupuy, before we go 
20110112143336.036|20110112143337.270|TR0|back to Port-au-Prince with 
20110112143337.270|20110112143338.504|TR0|Patrick Elie, about the U.S. 
20110112143338.504|20110112143339.739|TR0|official who was in charge of 
20110112143339.739|20110112143340.973|TR0|relief efforts following Haiti's 
20110112143340.973|20110112143342.208|TR0|devastating earthquake who has 
20110112143342.208|20110112143343.442|TR0|accused a major contractor of 
20110112143343.442|20110112143344.676|TR0|shortchanging him for his 
20110112143344.676|20110112143345.911|TR0|assistance in securing more than 
20110112143345.911|20110112143347.145|TR0|$20 million in reconstruction 
20110112143347.145|20110112143348.380|TR0|deals. It was the Haiti Recovery 
20110112143348.380|20110112143349.614|TR0|Group he's suing, and it was 
20110112143349.614|20110112143350.849|TR0|Lewis Lucke that the Associated 
20110112143350.849|20110112143352.083|TR0|Press was reporting on.
20110112143352.083|20110112143353.317|TR0|
20110112143353.317|20110112143354.552|TR0|>> ALEX DUPUY: Well, I don't 
20110112143354.552|20110112143355.786|TR0|know all the specifics of that 
20110112143355.786|20110112143357.021|TR0|suit, but what is known is that, 
20110112143357.021|20110112143358.255|TR0|of the contracts that have been 
20110112143358.255|20110112143359.489|TR0|given out by the Interim Haiti 
20110112143359.489|20110112143400.724|TR0|Recovery Commission, most of 
20110112143400.724|20110112143401.958|TR0|those contracts have gone to 
20110112143401.958|20110112143403.193|TR0|U.S. firms. Only two of them 
20110112143403.193|20110112143404.427|TR0|went to Haitian firms. And a 
20110112143404.427|20110112143405.661|TR0|significant percentage of the 
20110112143405.661|20110112143406.896|TR0|contracts that went to U.S. 
20110112143406.896|20110112143408.130|TR0|firms went to two firms, 
20110112143408.130|20110112143409.365|TR0|according to news reports, with 
20110112143409.365|20110112143410.599|TR0|no-bid contracts. So, I am not 
20110112143410.599|20110112143411.833|TR0|sure if this is what the suit is 
20110112143411.833|20110112143413.068|TR0|targeting, but -
20110112143413.068|20110112143414.302|TR0|
20110112143414.302|20110112143415.537|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask - let 
20110112143415.537|20110112143416.771|TR0|me ask Jean Saint-Vil. Are you 
20110112143416.771|20110112143418.005|TR0|familiar with this case?
20110112143418.005|20110112143419.240|TR0|
20110112143419.240|20110112143420.474|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL: Yes, I have 
20110112143420.474|20110112143421.709|TR0|read the report on the web about 
20110112143421.709|20110112143422.943|TR0|this. And if I am not mistaken, 
20110112143422.943|20110112143424.177|TR0|Mr. Lewis Lucke is actually a 
20110112143424.177|20110112143425.412|TR0|former U.S. ambassador to 
20110112143425.412|20110112143426.646|TR0|Swaziland, and he was working 
20110112143426.646|20110112143427.881|TR0|with the USAID in Haiti. And 
20110112143427.881|20110112143429.115|TR0|he's suing the Haitian company 
20110112143429.115|20110112143430.350|TR0|led by Bigio, the Bigio Group 
20110112143430.350|20110112143431.584|TR0|[GB Group], which - actually, 
20110112143431.584|20110112143432.818|TR0|Bigio is described as the 
20110112143432.818|20110112143434.053|TR0|richest man in Haiti, part of 
20110112143434.053|20110112143435.287|TR0|the small Haitian elite that 
20110112143435.287|20110112143436.522|TR0|controls basically the economic 
20110112143436.522|20110112143437.756|TR0|life of Haiti. What's 
20110112143437.756|20110112143438.990|TR0|interesting in this article is 
20110112143438.990|20110112143440.225|TR0|that it's describing that the 
20110112143440.225|20110112143441.459|TR0|work that Lewis Lucke has done 
20110112143441.459|20110112143442.694|TR0|is really lobbying former U.S. 
20110112143442.694|20110112143443.928|TR0|presidents Bill Clinton and 
20110112143443.928|20110112143445.162|TR0|George Bush for contracts that 
20110112143445.162|20110112143446.397|TR0|he was securing for American 
20110112143446.397|20110112143447.631|TR0|companies. To me, this is an 
20110112143447.631|20110112143448.866|TR0|example of exactly what is wrong 
20110112143448.866|20110112143450.100|TR0|with the current model, where 
20110112143450.100|20110112143451.334|TR0|non-Haitians have more power 
20110112143451.334|20110112143452.569|TR0|than Haitian leaders in Haiti, 
20110112143452.569|20110112143453.803|TR0|and the corruption that has been 
20110112143453.803|20110112143455.038|TR0|treated in Haiti as if it was, 
20110112143455.038|20110112143456.272|TR0|you know, a genetic disease that 
20110112143456.272|20110112143457.506|TR0|only affects the Haitian players.
20110112143457.506|20110112143458.741|TR0|
20110112143458.741|20110112143459.975|TR0|We are seeing that the IHRC, led 
20110112143459.975|20110112143501.210|TR0|by Bill Clinton and Jean-Max 
20110112143501.210|20110112143502.444|TR0|Bellerive, is actually only led 
20110112143502.444|20110112143503.679|TR0|by the international players. 
20110112143503.679|20110112143504.913|TR0|People have actually been 
20110112143504.913|20110112143506.147|TR0|asking, "Where is the Haitian 
20110112143506.147|20110112143507.382|TR0|prime minister, Jean-Max 
20110112143507.382|20110112143508.616|TR0|Bellerive?" At the last meeting 
20110112143508.616|20110112143509.851|TR0|that took place in Dominican 
20110112143509.851|20110112143511.085|TR0|Republic, he wasn't even there. 
20110112143511.085|20110112143512.319|TR0|And that's where the 12 members 
20110112143512.319|20110112143513.554|TR0|of the Haitian participants in 
20110112143513.554|20110112143514.788|TR0|this commission were saying that 
20110112143514.788|20110112143516.023|TR0|contracts are being signed, 
20110112143516.023|20110112143517.257|TR0|major decisions are being made, 
20110112143517.257|20110112143518.491|TR0|without them being involved. So, 
20110112143518.491|20110112143519.726|TR0|basically, the Clinton Global 
20110112143519.726|20110112143520.960|TR0|Initiative and Bill Clinton 
20110112143520.960|20110112143522.195|TR0|himself, not to talk about all 
20110112143522.195|20110112143523.429|TR0|the conflict of interest being 
20110112143523.429|20110112143524.663|TR0|the husband of the U.S. 
20110112143524.663|20110112143525.898|TR0|Secretary of State - I mean, 
20110112143525.898|20110112143527.132|TR0|Haiti is not being led by 
20110112143527.132|20110112143528.367|TR0|Haitians, and that's basically 
20110112143528.367|20110112143529.601|TR0|what's been wrong with the 
20110112143529.601|20110112143530.835|TR0|situation since 2004.
20110112143530.835|20110112143532.070|TR0|
20110112143532.070|20110112143533.304|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Patrick Elie, I 
20110112143533.304|20110112143534.539|TR0|want to come back to you, as you 
20110112143534.539|20110112143535.773|TR0|stand there in front of the 
20110112143535.773|20110112143537.008|TR0|Champ de Mars, where so many 
20110112143537.008|20110112143538.242|TR0|people remain in these refugee 
20110112143538.242|20110112143539.476|TR0|camps. And I was wondering if 
20110112143539.476|20110112143540.711|TR0|you could give us a history 
20110112143540.711|20110112143541.945|TR0|lesson, for those not familiar 
20110112143541.945|20110112143543.180|TR0|with Haiti, in its birth out of 
20110112143543.180|20110112143544.414|TR0|a slave rebellion, and then what 
20110112143544.414|20110112143545.648|TR0|you think needs to happen right 
20110112143545.648|20110112143546.883|TR0|now concretely on the ground, as 
20110112143546.883|20110112143548.117|TR0|you say your country is being 
20110112143548.117|20110112143549.352|TR0|controlled by foreign interests, 
20110112143549.352|20110112143550.586|TR0|by foreign governments.
20110112143550.586|20110112143551.820|TR0|
20110112143551.820|20110112143553.055|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: It is indeed a 
20110112143553.055|20110112143554.289|TR0|huge challenge that we're facing 
20110112143554.289|20110112143555.524|TR0|as a people, maybe as big as the 
20110112143555.524|20110112143556.758|TR0|one we did face successfully in 
20110112143556.758|20110112143557.992|TR0|1804. And as for, if you want, 
20110112143557.992|20110112143559.227|TR0|the vultures descending on 
20110112143559.227|20110112143600.461|TR0|Haiti, I believe we evoked that 
20110112143600.461|20110112143601.696|TR0|the last time we met on the 
20110112143601.696|20110112143602.930|TR0|Montana. And the only people 
20110112143602.930|20110112143604.164|TR0|that can prevent that are the 
20110112143604.164|20110112143605.399|TR0|Haitians themselves, with the 
20110112143605.399|20110112143606.633|TR0|help of foreign friends that 
20110112143606.633|20110112143607.868|TR0|keep their vigilance high, 
20110112143607.868|20110112143609.102|TR0|because, you know, things are 
20110112143609.102|20110112143610.336|TR0|going on that are beyond the 
20110112143610.336|20110112143611.571|TR0|back of the people of the world 
20110112143611.571|20110112143612.805|TR0|that were so generous toward 
20110112143612.805|20110112143614.040|TR0|Haiti and beyond the back of the 
20110112143614.040|20110112143615.274|TR0|Haitian people. And really what 
20110112143615.274|20110112143616.509|TR0|needs to be done is not easy to 
20110112143616.509|20110112143617.743|TR0|map out. To tell you the truth, 
20110112143617.743|20110112143618.977|TR0|there is no magic wand.
20110112143618.977|20110112143620.212|TR0|
20110112143620.212|20110112143621.446|TR0|A lot of the people you see out 
20110112143621.446|20110112143622.681|TR0|in the Champ de Mars, they were 
20110112143622.681|20110112143623.915|TR0|not living any better before in 
20110112143623.915|20110112143625.149|TR0|Cite Soleil and in the different 
20110112143625.149|20110112143626.384|TR0|shanty towns. The difference is 
20110112143626.384|20110112143627.618|TR0|that now they're making their 
20110112143627.618|20110112143628.853|TR0|presence known, they're in your 
20110112143628.853|20110112143630.087|TR0|face, so to speak. And I hope 
20110112143630.087|20110112143631.321|TR0|that they will be able to show 
20110112143631.321|20110112143632.556|TR0|both the world outside and the 
20110112143632.556|20110112143633.790|TR0|Haitian elite that things have 
20110112143633.790|20110112143635.025|TR0|to change. And in a way - and I 
20110112143635.025|20110112143636.259|TR0|measure my words - to see these 
20110112143636.259|20110112143637.493|TR0|people in the Champ de Mars 
20110112143637.493|20110112143638.728|TR0|right smack in front of the 
20110112143638.728|20110112143639.962|TR0|National Palace is a positive 
20110112143639.962|20110112143641.197|TR0|message. It has to remind anyone 
20110112143641.197|20110112143642.431|TR0|who find itself in this ruin of 
20110112143642.431|20110112143643.665|TR0|a building, anyone who is living 
20110112143643.665|20110112143644.900|TR0|in a five million U.S.-dollar 
20110112143644.900|20110112143646.134|TR0|mansion, that these are 
20110112143646.134|20110112143647.369|TR0|Haitians, and they have to be, 
20110112143647.369|20110112143648.603|TR0|if you want, enfranchised and 
20110112143648.603|20110112143649.838|TR0|that their needs and their 
20110112143649.838|20110112143651.072|TR0|demands have to be met. So, you 
20110112143651.072|20110112143652.306|TR0|know, as they say in Haiti, 
20110112143652.306|20110112143653.541|TR0|"C'est un bien pour un mal," 
20110112143653.541|20110112143654.775|TR0|we've exchanged an evil for a 
20110112143654.775|20110112143656.010|TR0|message that had to be heard for 
20110112143656.010|20110112143657.244|TR0|years and years.
20110112143657.244|20110112143658.478|TR0|
20110112143658.478|20110112143659.713|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What, at this 
20110112143659.713|20110112143700.947|TR0|point, do you feel needs to be 
20110112143700.947|20110112143702.182|TR0|done? Do you feel that the IHRC, 
20110112143702.182|20110112143703.416|TR0|that is run by President 
20110112143703.416|20110112143704.650|TR0|Clinton, former President 
20110112143704.650|20110112143705.885|TR0|Clinton, and Bellerive, should 
20110112143705.885|20110112143707.119|TR0|it continue? Should it be 
20110112143707.119|20110112143708.354|TR0|dismantled? You talk about a 
20110112143708.354|20110112143709.588|TR0|community organizations that 
20110112143709.588|20110112143710.822|TR0|could rise up, a changing of 
20110112143710.822|20110112143712.057|TR0|Port-au-Prince, but how will 
20110112143712.057|20110112143713.291|TR0|this actually happen?
20110112143713.291|20110112143714.526|TR0|
20110112143714.526|20110112143715.760|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: I do believe 
20110112143715.760|20110112143716.994|TR0|that we need something different 
20110112143716.994|20110112143718.229|TR0|from the Haitian state as it is, 
20110112143718.229|20110112143719.463|TR0|and as it will emerge from this 
20110112143719.463|20110112143720.698|TR0|election, to lead the effort in 
20110112143720.698|20110112143721.932|TR0|reconstruction. Obviously, there 
20110112143721.932|20110112143723.167|TR0|has to be parliamentary 
20110112143723.167|20110112143724.401|TR0|representative of the donors, 
20110112143724.401|20110112143725.635|TR0|but mostly the Haitian 
20110112143725.635|20110112143726.870|TR0|representation should reflect 
20110112143726.870|20110112143728.104|TR0|more the Haitian community as it 
20110112143728.104|20110112143729.339|TR0|is. It's not enough to have 
20110112143729.339|20110112143730.573|TR0|big-shot lawyers and 
20110112143730.573|20110112143731.807|TR0|technicians. The voice of the 
20110112143731.807|20110112143733.042|TR0|communities, both of 
20110112143733.042|20110112143734.276|TR0|Port-au-Prince but also in the 
20110112143734.276|20110112143735.511|TR0|other parts of the country, 
20110112143735.511|20110112143736.745|TR0|which represent our way out of 
20110112143736.745|20110112143737.979|TR0|this mess, their voices have to 
20110112143737.979|20110112143739.214|TR0|be heard also. And to be frank, 
20110112143739.214|20110112143740.448|TR0|I have not heard those voices 
20110112143740.448|20110112143741.683|TR0|spoken in the reconstruction. 
20110112143741.683|20110112143742.917|TR0|So, for me, personally, one of 
20110112143742.917|20110112143744.151|TR0|the very encouraging things that 
20110112143744.151|20110112143745.386|TR0|emerged from the earthquake was 
20110112143745.386|20110112143746.620|TR0|the birth, or the rebirth, of 
20110112143746.620|20110112143747.855|TR0|the neighborhood committees. And 
20110112143747.855|20110112143749.089|TR0|many of them, I must admit, you 
20110112143749.089|20110112143750.323|TR0|know, just organized so that 
20110112143750.323|20110112143751.558|TR0|they could profit for the 
20110112143751.558|20110112143752.792|TR0|charity. But some of them have 
20110112143752.792|20110112143754.027|TR0|remained, and they are, if you 
20110112143754.027|20110112143755.261|TR0|want, sketching their way ahead. 
20110112143755.261|20110112143756.495|TR0|And the movement has spread away 
20110112143756.495|20110112143757.730|TR0|from Port-au-Prince and away 
20110112143757.730|20110112143758.964|TR0|from the cities to what we call 
20110112143758.964|20110112143800.199|TR0|the lakou, which are the small 
20110112143800.199|20110112143801.433|TR0|peasant communities. In my 
20110112143801.433|20110112143802.668|TR0|opinion, there lies the future 
20110112143802.668|20110112143803.902|TR0|of Haiti and of its democracy, 
20110112143803.902|20110112143805.136|TR0|not up in the fancy hotel or the 
20110112143805.136|20110112143806.371|TR0|convention centers.

20110112143808.840|20110112143810.074|TR0|want to thank you for being with 
20110112143810.074|20110112143811.308|TR0|us, Haitian democracy activist, 
20110112143811.308|20110112143812.543|TR0|speaking to us from 
20110112143812.543|20110112143813.777|TR0|Port-au-Prince. When we come 
20110112143813.777|20110112143815.012|TR0|back from break, we will go to 
20110112143815.012|20110112143816.246|TR0|Carrefour to speak with the 
20110112143816.246|20110112143817.480|TR0|Haitian writer Edwidge Danticat, 
20110112143817.480|20110112143818.715|TR0|the Haitian American novelist. 
20110112143818.715|20110112143819.949|TR0|Stay with us.

20110112143823.652|20110112143824.887|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to 
20110112143824.887|20110112143826.121|TR0|bring in Jean Saint-Vil and then 
20110112143826.121|20110112143827.356|TR0|get your response, Patrick Elie. 
20110112143827.356|20110112143828.590|TR0|We're turning to Canada. He's in 
20110112143828.590|20110112143829.824|TR0|Ottawa, the Haitian writer and 
20110112143829.824|20110112143831.059|TR0|activist, his website,

20110112143832.293|20110112143833.528|TR0|
20110112143833.528|20110112143834.762|TR0|On this first anniversary of the 
20110112143834.762|20110112143835.997|TR0|earthquake that killed hundreds 
20110112143835.997|20110112143837.231|TR0|of thousands of people, now more 
20110112143837.231|20110112143838.465|TR0|than a million - and the country 
20110112143838.465|20110112143839.700|TR0|is only 10 million people - and 
20110112143839.700|20110112143840.934|TR0|cholera ravaging through the 
20110112143840.934|20110112143842.169|TR0|country, Jean Saint-Vil, your 
20110112143842.169|20110112143843.403|TR0|thoughts?
20110112143843.403|20110112143844.637|TR0|
20110112143844.637|20110112143845.872|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL: Well, I was 
20110112143845.872|20110112143847.106|TR0|listening attentively to Alex 
20110112143847.106|20110112143848.341|TR0|Dupuy and Patrick, and they've 
20110112143848.341|20110112143849.575|TR0|really covered a lot of my 
20110112143849.575|20110112143850.809|TR0|thoughts. And I think one of the 
20110112143850.809|20110112143852.044|TR0|things that is common in what 
20110112143852.044|20110112143853.278|TR0|they've said is that there is 
20110112143853.278|20110112143854.513|TR0|not evidence that we've made 
20110112143854.513|20110112143855.747|TR0|that shift. Patrick mentioned 
20110112143855.747|20110112143856.981|TR0|that Port-au-Prince is trying to 
20110112143856.981|20110112143858.216|TR0|rebuild itself on the same 
20110112143858.216|20110112143859.450|TR0|principle that it had built 
20110112143859.450|20110112143900.685|TR0|itself before and is - has 
20110112143900.685|20110112143901.919|TR0|collapsed. The same thing with 
20110112143901.919|20110112143903.153|TR0|the way Alex Dupuy described the 
20110112143903.153|20110112143904.388|TR0|international community.
20110112143904.388|20110112143905.622|TR0|
20110112143905.622|20110112143906.857|TR0|I think that another Haitian 
20110112143906.857|20110112143908.091|TR0|author described it pretty well: 
20110112143908.091|20110112143909.326|TR0|Edwidge Danticat, who published 
20110112143909.326|20110112143910.560|TR0|in the Miami Herald earlier this 
20110112143910.560|20110112143911.794|TR0|week an article titled "Haitians 
20110112143911.794|20110112143913.029|TR0|Are Tired, But We Are Not 
20110112143913.029|20110112143914.263|TR0|Defeated." I would add that we 
20110112143914.263|20110112143915.498|TR0|are sick and tired, but not 
20110112143915.498|20110112143916.732|TR0|defeated. As you mentioned, we 
20110112143916.732|20110112143917.966|TR0|have lost more than 3,700 
20110112143917.966|20110112143919.201|TR0|Haitians through the cholera 
20110112143919.201|20110112143920.435|TR0|brought to Haiti by U.N. troops.
20110112143920.435|20110112143921.670|TR0|
20110112143921.670|20110112143922.904|TR0|And what we are seeing is, 
20110112143922.904|20110112143924.138|TR0|instead of resources being 
20110112143924.138|20110112143925.373|TR0|mobilized to deal with 
20110112143925.373|20110112143926.607|TR0|protecting human lives, building 
20110112143926.607|20110112143927.842|TR0|infrastructures for a new Haiti, 
20110112143927.842|20110112143929.076|TR0|instead we're seeing the 
20110112143929.076|20110112143930.310|TR0|international community, which 
20110112143930.310|20110112143931.545|TR0|includes the United Nations, 
20110112143931.545|20110112143932.779|TR0|mobilizing resources to maintain 
20110112143932.779|20110112143934.014|TR0|the status quo. So, my 
20110112143934.014|20110112143935.248|TR0|perspective on this is that one 
20110112143935.248|20110112143936.482|TR0|year after the earthquake, we 
20110112143936.482|20110112143937.717|TR0|are seeing the Haitian 
20110112143937.717|20110112143938.951|TR0|population being treated and 
20110112143938.951|20110112143940.186|TR0|seen as a threat, rather than as 
20110112143940.186|20110112143941.420|TR0|an asset. And to me, that's the 
20110112143941.420|20110112143942.654|TR0|major paradigm shift that must 
20110112143942.654|20110112143943.889|TR0|occur if we have to get out of 
20110112143943.889|20110112143945.123|TR0|this mess.
20110112143945.123|20110112143946.358|TR0|
20110112143946.358|20110112143947.592|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask 
20110112143947.592|20110112143948.827|TR0|you, Alex Dupuy, before we go 
20110112143948.827|20110112143950.061|TR0|back to Port-au-Prince with 
20110112143950.061|20110112143951.295|TR0|Patrick Elie, about the U.S. 
20110112143951.295|20110112143952.530|TR0|official who was in charge of 
20110112143952.530|20110112143953.764|TR0|relief efforts following Haiti's 
20110112143953.764|20110112143954.999|TR0|devastating earthquake who has 
20110112143954.999|20110112143956.233|TR0|accused a major contractor of 
20110112143956.233|20110112143957.467|TR0|shortchanging him for his 
20110112143957.467|20110112143958.702|TR0|assistance in securing more than 
20110112143958.702|20110112143959.936|TR0|$20 million in reconstruction 
20110112143959.936|20110112144001.171|TR0|deals. It was the Haiti Recovery 
20110112144001.171|20110112144002.405|TR0|Group he's suing, and it was 
20110112144002.405|20110112144003.639|TR0|Lewis Lucke that the Associated 
20110112144003.639|20110112144004.874|TR0|Press was reporting on.
20110112144004.874|20110112144006.108|TR0|
20110112144006.108|20110112144007.343|TR0|>> ALEX DUPUY: Well, I don't 
20110112144007.343|20110112144008.577|TR0|know all the specifics of that 
20110112144008.577|20110112144009.811|TR0|suit, but what is known is that, 
20110112144009.811|20110112144011.046|TR0|of the contracts that have been 
20110112144011.046|20110112144012.280|TR0|given out by the Interim Haiti 
20110112144012.280|20110112144013.515|TR0|Recovery Commission, most of 
20110112144013.515|20110112144014.749|TR0|those contracts have gone to 
20110112144014.749|20110112144015.983|TR0|U.S. firms. Only two of them 
20110112144015.983|20110112144017.218|TR0|went to Haitian firms. And a 
20110112144017.218|20110112144018.452|TR0|significant percentage of the 
20110112144018.452|20110112144019.687|TR0|contracts that went to U.S. 
20110112144019.687|20110112144020.921|TR0|firms went to two firms, 
20110112144020.921|20110112144022.156|TR0|according to news reports, with 
20110112144022.156|20110112144023.390|TR0|no-bid contracts. So, I am not 
20110112144023.390|20110112144024.624|TR0|sure if this is what the suit is 
20110112144024.624|20110112144025.859|TR0|targeting, but -
20110112144025.859|20110112144027.093|TR0|
20110112144027.093|20110112144028.328|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask - let 
20110112144028.328|20110112144029.562|TR0|me ask Jean Saint-Vil. Are you 
20110112144029.562|20110112144030.796|TR0|familiar with this case?
20110112144030.796|20110112144032.031|TR0|
20110112144032.031|20110112144033.265|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL: Yes, I have 
20110112144033.265|20110112144034.500|TR0|read the report on the web about 
20110112144034.500|20110112144035.734|TR0|this. And if I am not mistaken, 
20110112144035.734|20110112144036.968|TR0|Mr. Lewis Lucke is actually a 
20110112144036.968|20110112144038.203|TR0|former U.S. ambassador to 
20110112144038.203|20110112144039.437|TR0|Swaziland, and he was working 
20110112144039.437|20110112144040.672|TR0|with the USAID in Haiti. And 
20110112144040.672|20110112144041.906|TR0|he's suing the Haitian company 
20110112144041.906|20110112144043.140|TR0|led by Bigio, the Bigio Group 
20110112144043.140|20110112144044.375|TR0|[GB Group], which - actually, 
20110112144044.375|20110112144045.609|TR0|Bigio is described as the 
20110112144045.609|20110112144046.844|TR0|richest man in Haiti, part of 
20110112144046.844|20110112144048.078|TR0|the small Haitian elite that 
20110112144048.078|20110112144049.312|TR0|controls basically the economic 
20110112144049.312|20110112144050.547|TR0|life of Haiti. What's 
20110112144050.547|20110112144051.781|TR0|interesting in this article is 
20110112144051.781|20110112144053.016|TR0|that it's describing that the 
20110112144053.016|20110112144054.250|TR0|work that Lewis Lucke has done 
20110112144054.250|20110112144055.485|TR0|is really lobbying former U.S. 
20110112144055.485|20110112144056.719|TR0|presidents Bill Clinton and 
20110112144056.719|20110112144057.953|TR0|George Bush for contracts that 
20110112144057.953|20110112144059.188|TR0|he was securing for American 
20110112144059.188|20110112144100.422|TR0|companies. To me, this is an 
20110112144100.422|20110112144101.657|TR0|example of exactly what is wrong 
20110112144101.657|20110112144102.891|TR0|with the current model, where 
20110112144102.891|20110112144104.125|TR0|non-Haitians have more power 
20110112144104.125|20110112144105.360|TR0|than Haitian leaders in Haiti, 
20110112144105.360|20110112144106.594|TR0|and the corruption that has been 
20110112144106.594|20110112144107.829|TR0|treated in Haiti as if it was, 
20110112144107.829|20110112144109.063|TR0|you know, a genetic disease that 
20110112144109.063|20110112144110.297|TR0|only affects the Haitian players.
20110112144110.297|20110112144111.532|TR0|
20110112144111.532|20110112144112.766|TR0|We are seeing that the IHRC, led 
20110112144112.766|20110112144114.001|TR0|by Bill Clinton and Jean-Max 
20110112144114.001|20110112144115.235|TR0|Bellerive, is actually only led 
20110112144115.235|20110112144116.469|TR0|by the international players. 
20110112144116.469|20110112144117.704|TR0|People have actually been 
20110112144117.704|20110112144118.938|TR0|asking, "Where is the Haitian 
20110112144118.938|20110112144120.173|TR0|prime minister, Jean-Max 
20110112144120.173|20110112144121.407|TR0|Bellerive?" At the last meeting 
20110112144121.407|20110112144122.641|TR0|that took place in Dominican 
20110112144122.641|20110112144123.876|TR0|Republic, he wasn't even there. 
20110112144123.876|20110112144125.110|TR0|And that's where the 12 members 
20110112144125.110|20110112144126.345|TR0|of the Haitian participants in 
20110112144126.345|20110112144127.579|TR0|this commission were saying that 
20110112144127.579|20110112144128.814|TR0|contracts are being signed, 
20110112144128.814|20110112144130.048|TR0|major decisions are being made, 
20110112144130.048|20110112144131.282|TR0|without them being involved. So, 
20110112144131.282|20110112144132.517|TR0|basically, the Clinton Global 
20110112144132.517|20110112144133.751|TR0|Initiative and Bill Clinton 
20110112144133.751|20110112144134.986|TR0|himself, not to talk about all 
20110112144134.986|20110112144136.220|TR0|the conflict of interest being 
20110112144136.220|20110112144137.454|TR0|the husband of the U.S. 
20110112144137.454|20110112144138.689|TR0|Secretary of State - I mean, 
20110112144138.689|20110112144139.923|TR0|Haiti is not being led by 
20110112144139.923|20110112144141.158|TR0|Haitians, and that's basically 
20110112144141.158|20110112144142.392|TR0|what's been wrong with the 
20110112144142.392|20110112144143.626|TR0|situation since 2004.
20110112144143.626|20110112144144.861|TR0|
20110112144144.861|20110112144146.095|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Patrick Elie, I 
20110112144146.095|20110112144147.330|TR0|want to come back to you, as you 
20110112144147.330|20110112144148.564|TR0|stand there in front of the 
20110112144148.564|20110112144149.798|TR0|Champ de Mars, where so many 
20110112144149.798|20110112144151.033|TR0|people remain in these refugee 
20110112144151.033|20110112144152.267|TR0|camps. And I was wondering if 
20110112144152.267|20110112144153.502|TR0|you could give us a history 
20110112144153.502|20110112144154.736|TR0|lesson, for those not familiar 
20110112144154.736|20110112144155.970|TR0|with Haiti, in its birth out of 
20110112144155.970|20110112144157.205|TR0|a slave rebellion, and then what 
20110112144157.205|20110112144158.439|TR0|you think needs to happen right 
20110112144158.439|20110112144159.674|TR0|now concretely on the ground, as 
20110112144159.674|20110112144200.908|TR0|you say your country is being 
20110112144200.908|20110112144202.142|TR0|controlled by foreign interests, 
20110112144202.142|20110112144203.377|TR0|by foreign governments.
20110112144203.377|20110112144204.611|TR0|
20110112144204.611|20110112144205.846|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: It is indeed a 
20110112144205.846|20110112144207.080|TR0|huge challenge that we're facing 
20110112144207.080|20110112144208.315|TR0|as a people, maybe as big as the 
20110112144208.315|20110112144209.549|TR0|one we did face successfully in 
20110112144209.549|20110112144210.783|TR0|1804. And as for, if you want, 
20110112144210.783|20110112144212.018|TR0|the vultures descending on 
20110112144212.018|20110112144213.252|TR0|Haiti, I believe we evoked that 
20110112144213.252|20110112144214.487|TR0|the last time we met on the 
20110112144214.487|20110112144215.721|TR0|Montana. And the only people 
20110112144215.721|20110112144216.955|TR0|that can prevent that are the 
20110112144216.955|20110112144218.190|TR0|Haitians themselves, with the 
20110112144218.190|20110112144219.424|TR0|help of foreign friends that 
20110112144219.424|20110112144220.659|TR0|keep their vigilance high, 
20110112144220.659|20110112144221.893|TR0|because, you know, things are 
20110112144221.893|20110112144223.127|TR0|going on that are beyond the 
20110112144223.127|20110112144224.362|TR0|back of the people of the world 
20110112144224.362|20110112144225.596|TR0|that were so generous toward 
20110112144225.596|20110112144226.831|TR0|Haiti and beyond the back of the 
20110112144226.831|20110112144228.065|TR0|Haitian people. And really what 
20110112144228.065|20110112144229.299|TR0|needs to be done is not easy to 
20110112144229.299|20110112144230.534|TR0|map out. To tell you the truth, 
20110112144230.534|20110112144231.768|TR0|there is no magic wand.
20110112144231.768|20110112144233.003|TR0|
20110112144233.003|20110112144234.237|TR0|A lot of the people you see out 
20110112144234.237|20110112144235.471|TR0|in the Champ de Mars, they were 
20110112144235.471|20110112144236.706|TR0|not living any better before in 
20110112144236.706|20110112144237.940|TR0|Cite Soleil and in the different 
20110112144237.940|20110112144239.175|TR0|shanty towns. The difference is 
20110112144239.175|20110112144240.409|TR0|that now they're making their 
20110112144240.409|20110112144241.644|TR0|presence known, they're in your 
20110112144241.644|20110112144242.878|TR0|face, so to speak. And I hope 
20110112144242.878|20110112144244.112|TR0|that they will be able to show 
20110112144244.112|20110112144245.347|TR0|both the world outside and the 
20110112144245.347|20110112144246.581|TR0|Haitian elite that things have 
20110112144246.581|20110112144247.816|TR0|to change. And in a way - and I 
20110112144247.816|20110112144249.050|TR0|measure my words - to see these 
20110112144249.050|20110112144250.284|TR0|people in the Champ de Mars 
20110112144250.284|20110112144251.519|TR0|right smack in front of the 
20110112144251.519|20110112144252.753|TR0|National Palace is a positive 
20110112144252.753|20110112144253.988|TR0|message. It has to remind anyone 
20110112144253.988|20110112144255.222|TR0|who find itself in this ruin of 
20110112144255.222|20110112144256.456|TR0|a building, anyone who is living 
20110112144256.456|20110112144257.691|TR0|in a five million U.S.-dollar 
20110112144257.691|20110112144258.925|TR0|mansion, that these are 
20110112144258.925|20110112144300.160|TR0|Haitians, and they have to be, 
20110112144300.160|20110112144301.394|TR0|if you want, enfranchised and 
20110112144301.394|20110112144302.628|TR0|that their needs and their 
20110112144302.628|20110112144303.863|TR0|demands have to be met. So, you 
20110112144303.863|20110112144305.097|TR0|know, as they say in Haiti, 
20110112144305.097|20110112144306.332|TR0|"C'est un bien pour un mal," 
20110112144306.332|20110112144307.566|TR0|we've exchanged an evil for a 
20110112144307.566|20110112144308.800|TR0|message that had to be heard for 
20110112144308.800|20110112144310.035|TR0|years and years.

20110112144311.269|20110112144312.504|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What, at this 
20110112144312.504|20110112144313.738|TR0|point, do you feel needs to be 
20110112144313.738|20110112144314.973|TR0|done? Do you feel that the IHRC, 
20110112144314.973|20110112144316.207|TR0|that is run by President 
20110112144316.207|20110112144317.441|TR0|Clinton, former President 
20110112144317.441|20110112144318.676|TR0|Clinton, and Bellerive, should 
20110112144318.676|20110112144319.910|TR0|it continue? Should it be 
20110112144319.910|20110112144321.145|TR0|dismantled? You talk about a 
20110112144321.145|20110112144322.379|TR0|community organizations that 
20110112144322.379|20110112144323.613|TR0|could rise up, a changing of 
20110112144323.613|20110112144324.848|TR0|Port-au-Prince, but how will 
20110112144324.848|20110112144326.082|TR0|this actually happen?
20110112144326.082|20110112144327.317|TR0|
20110112144327.317|20110112144328.551|TR0|>> PATRICK ELIE: I do believe 
20110112144328.551|20110112144329.785|TR0|that we need something different 
20110112144329.785|20110112144331.020|TR0|from the Haitian state as it is, 
20110112144331.020|20110112144332.254|TR0|and as it will emerge from this 
20110112144332.254|20110112144333.489|TR0|election, to lead the effort in 
20110112144333.489|20110112144334.723|TR0|reconstruction. Obviously, there 
20110112144334.723|20110112144335.957|TR0|has to be parliamentary 
20110112144335.957|20110112144337.192|TR0|representative of the donors, 
20110112144337.192|20110112144338.426|TR0|but mostly the Haitian 
20110112144338.426|20110112144339.661|TR0|representation should reflect 
20110112144339.661|20110112144340.895|TR0|more the Haitian community as it 
20110112144340.895|20110112144342.129|TR0|is. It's not enough to have 
20110112144342.129|20110112144343.364|TR0|big-shot lawyers and 
20110112144343.364|20110112144344.598|TR0|technicians. The voice of the 
20110112144344.598|20110112144345.833|TR0|communities, both of 
20110112144345.833|20110112144347.067|TR0|Port-au-Prince but also in the 
20110112144347.067|20110112144348.301|TR0|other parts of the country, 
20110112144348.301|20110112144349.536|TR0|which represent our way out of 
20110112144349.536|20110112144350.770|TR0|this mess, their voices have to 
20110112144350.770|20110112144352.005|TR0|be heard also. And to be frank, 
20110112144352.005|20110112144353.239|TR0|I have not heard those voices 
20110112144353.239|20110112144354.474|TR0|spoken in the reconstruction. 
20110112144354.474|20110112144355.708|TR0|So, for me, personally, one of 
20110112144355.708|20110112144356.942|TR0|the very encouraging things that 
20110112144356.942|20110112144358.177|TR0|emerged from the earthquake was 
20110112144358.177|20110112144359.411|TR0|the birth, or the rebirth, of 
20110112144359.411|20110112144400.646|TR0|the neighborhood committees. And 
20110112144400.646|20110112144401.880|TR0|many of them, I must admit, you 
20110112144401.880|20110112144403.114|TR0|know, just organized so that 
20110112144403.114|20110112144404.349|TR0|they could profit for the 
20110112144404.349|20110112144405.583|TR0|charity. But some of them have 
20110112144405.583|20110112144406.818|TR0|remained, and they are, if you 
20110112144406.818|20110112144408.052|TR0|want, sketching their way ahead. 
20110112144408.052|20110112144409.286|TR0|And the movement has spread away 
20110112144409.286|20110112144410.521|TR0|from Port-au-Prince and away 
20110112144410.521|20110112144411.755|TR0|from the cities to what we call 
20110112144411.755|20110112144412.990|TR0|the lakou, which are the small 
20110112144412.990|20110112144414.224|TR0|peasant communities. In my 
20110112144414.224|20110112144415.458|TR0|opinion, there lies the future 
20110112144415.458|20110112144416.693|TR0|of Haiti and of its democracy, 
20110112144416.693|20110112144417.927|TR0|not up in the fancy hotel or the 
20110112144417.927|20110112144419.162|TR0|convention centers.

20110112144512.241|20110112144513.476|TR0|I think [inaudible] people, both 
20110112144513.476|20110112144514.710|TR0|here in Haiti and in the Haitian 
20110112144514.710|20110112144515.944|TR0|diaspora today, we feel a great 
20110112144515.944|20110112144517.179|TR0|deal of sadness, because today 
20110112144517.179|20110112144518.413|TR0|we remember, you know, so many 
20110112144518.413|20110112144519.648|TR0|people that this country lost, 
20110112144519.648|20110112144520.882|TR0|so many people lost to us 
20110112144520.882|20110112144522.116|TR0|personally. So there's the sense 
20110112144522.116|20110112144523.351|TR0|of sadness, the sense of 
20110112144523.351|20110112144524.585|TR0|commemoration. Today here is a 
20110112144524.585|20110112144525.820|TR0|national holiday. Schools and 
20110112144525.820|20110112144527.054|TR0|offices are closed. But there's 
20110112144527.054|20110112144528.288|TR0|still - you know, the streets 
20110112144528.288|20110112144529.523|TR0|are busy. People are trying to 
20110112144529.523|20110112144530.757|TR0|go about their days, and even 
20110112144530.757|20110112144531.992|TR0|though there are many religious 
20110112144531.992|20110112144533.226|TR0|ceremonies and prayer services 
20110112144533.226|20110112144534.460|TR0|planned, small and large. But 
20110112144534.460|20110112144535.695|TR0|there's still a sense that, 
20110112144535.695|20110112144536.929|TR0|because people don't have any 
20110112144536.929|20110112144538.164|TR0|choice, you know, they still 
20110112144538.164|20110112144539.398|TR0|have to wake up today and go 
20110112144539.398|20110112144540.633|TR0|about the daily business of

20110112144554.211|20110112144555.445|TR0|Pierre-Louis, and this Miami 
20110112144555.445|20110112144556.680|TR0|Herald-directed documentary 
20110112144556.680|20110112144557.914|TR0|called Nou Bouke  --  We Are 
20110112144557.914|20110112144559.149|TR0|Tired  --  talks about this myth 
20110112144559.149|20110112144600.383|TR0|of Sisyphus, of, you know, this 
20110112144600.383|20110112144601.617|TR0|Greek myth of someone rolling a 
20110112144601.617|20110112144602.852|TR0|rock up a hill and then finding 
20110112144602.852|20110112144604.086|TR0|that when you get up the hill, 
20110112144604.086|20110112144605.321|TR0|the rocks roll back down again, 
20110112144605.321|20110112144606.555|TR0|and it's a repetitive process. 
20110112144606.555|20110112144607.789|TR0|And the most sort of optimistic 
20110112144607.789|20110112144609.024|TR0|view of that story is that every 
20110112144609.024|20110112144610.258|TR0|time you do it, you think it's 
20110112144610.258|20110112144611.493|TR0|the last time. And she actually 
20110112144611.493|20110112144612.727|TR0|says it's an incredibly apt, at 
20110112144612.727|20110112144613.962|TR0|this moment, metaphor for Haiti 
20110112144613.962|20110112144615.196|TR0|and what Haitians are going 
20110112144615.196|20110112144616.430|TR0|through. But, you know, the 
20110112144616.430|20110112144617.665|TR0|upside of that is that - we've 
20110112144617.665|20110112144618.899|TR0|heard so much this year about 
20110112144618.899|20110112144620.134|TR0|it, in part because it's so true 
20110112144620.134|20110112144621.368|TR0|- Haitian people are very 
20110112144621.368|20110112144622.602|TR0|resilient. But it doesn't mean 
20110112144622.602|20110112144623.837|TR0|that they can, you know, suffer 
20110112144623.837|20110112144625.071|TR0|more than other people. And I 
20110112144625.071|20110112144626.306|TR0|think - and that's what also one 
20110112144626.306|20110112144627.540|TR0|needs to emphasize.
20110112144627.540|20110112144628.774|TR0|
20110112144628.774|20110112144630.009|TR0|A year later, there are a 
20110112144630.009|20110112144631.243|TR0|million-and-a-half people still 
20110112144631.243|20110112144632.478|TR0|living in tents. There's these 
20110112144632.478|20110112144633.712|TR0|reports of women being raped, 
20110112144633.712|20110112144634.946|TR0|and now, at this point, where 
20110112144634.946|20110112144636.181|TR0|some of the settlements are on 
20110112144636.181|20110112144637.415|TR0|private land and the owners are 
20110112144637.415|20110112144638.650|TR0|becoming tired of people being 
20110112144638.650|20110112144639.884|TR0|there and are intimidating them 
20110112144639.884|20110112144641.118|TR0|into relocating. So, even 
20110112144641.118|20110112144642.353|TR0|though, you know, there are 
20110112144642.353|20110112144643.587|TR0|still some great symbolic signs 
20110112144643.587|20110112144644.822|TR0|that we - for example, the 
20110112144644.822|20110112144646.056|TR0|reopening of the open market 
20110112144646.056|20110112144647.291|TR0|yesterday - but there's still a 
20110112144647.291|20110112144648.525|TR0|lot of suffering here. A lot of 
20110112144648.525|20110112144649.759|TR0|people are suffering. And as we 
20110112144649.759|20110112144650.994|TR0|remember the dead today, it's 
20110112144650.994|20110112144652.228|TR0|important to remember that, to 
20110112144652.228|20110112144653.463|TR0|this, there's a long suffering 
20110112144653.463|20110112144654.697|TR0|of the living that will continue 
20110112144654.697|20110112144655.931|TR0|past this day and to tomorrow 
20110112144655.931|20110112144657.166|TR0|and, sad to say, perhaps into 
20110112144657.166|20110112144658.400|TR0|next year and the following 
20110112144658.400|20110112144659.635|TR0|year. So we have to also 
20110112144659.635|20110112144700.869|TR0|remember the suffering of the 
20110112144700.869|20110112144702.103|TR0|living which continues here.

20110112144704.572|20110112144705.807|TR0|is affecting the people there, 
20110112144705.807|20110112144707.041|TR0|with some 3,600 people dead of 
20110112144707.041|20110112144708.275|TR0|cholera, 170,000 or so infected?
20110112144708.275|20110112144709.510|TR0|
20110112144709.510|20110112144710.744|TR0|>> EDWIDGE DANTICAT: Well, 
20110112144710.744|20110112144711.979|TR0|what's - there's been a stall in 
20110112144711.979|20110112144713.213|TR0|the conversation about cholera, 
20110112144713.213|20110112144714.447|TR0|in part because of the election 
20110112144714.447|20110112144715.682|TR0|stalemate here and as the 
20110112144715.682|20110112144716.916|TR0|anniversary is approaching, but 
20110112144716.916|20110112144718.151|TR0|it remains a very large problem. 
20110112144718.151|20110112144719.385|TR0|And potentially, you know, as 
20110112144719.385|20110112144720.619|TR0|the CDC and other organizations 
20110112144720.619|20110112144721.854|TR0|have declared, is that it can - 
20110112144721.854|20110112144723.088|TR0|cholera can potentially kill 
20110112144723.088|20110112144724.323|TR0|more people than the earthquake. 
20110112144724.323|20110112144725.557|TR0|And cholera can spread quickly, 
20110112144725.557|20110112144726.792|TR0|and has spread quickly in this 
20110112144726.792|20110112144728.026|TR0|country. And it was borne out of 
20110112144728.026|20110112144729.260|TR0|the circumstances that have been 
20110112144729.260|20110112144730.495|TR0|discussed, through - you know, 
20110112144730.495|20110112144731.729|TR0|whether one believes that it was 
20110112144731.729|20110112144732.964|TR0|through these Nepalese soldiers, 
20110112144732.964|20110112144734.198|TR0|but it can spread pretty 
20110112144734.198|20110112144735.432|TR0|quickly. And it's something 
20110112144735.432|20110112144736.667|TR0|also, as we look at these 
20110112144736.667|20110112144737.901|TR0|potential disasters, including 
20110112144737.901|20110112144739.136|TR0|the potential for lack of food 
20110112144739.136|20110112144740.370|TR0|security, because we have 
20110112144740.370|20110112144741.604|TR0|farmers in the Artibonite who 
20110112144741.604|20110112144742.839|TR0|refuse to go into the rice 
20110112144742.839|20110112144744.073|TR0|paddies, because they are afraid 
20110112144744.073|20110112144745.308|TR0|of the bacteria-infected waters 
20110112144745.308|20110112144746.542|TR0|there. So, there are a host of 
20110112144746.542|20110112144747.776|TR0|other issues also looming ahead, 
20110112144747.776|20110112144749.011|TR0|as we commemorate this day.

20110112144750.245|20110112144751.480|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I mean, the 
20110112144751.480|20110112144752.714|TR0|figures are stunning of how 
20110112144752.714|20110112144753.948|TR0|little money has made it to 
20110112144753.948|20110112144755.183|TR0|reconstruction in this year, of 
20110112144755.183|20110112144756.417|TR0|the $9 billion promised. I 
20110112144756.417|20110112144757.652|TR0|wanted to play for you a clip of 
20110112144757.652|20110112144758.886|TR0|President Clinton. I know he is 
20110112144758.886|20110112144800.121|TR0|back in Haiti right now. We were 
20110112144800.121|20110112144801.355|TR0|there right after the 
20110112144801.355|20110112144802.589|TR0|earthquake, and then Sharif 
20110112144802.589|20110112144803.824|TR0|Abdel Kouddous and Nicole 
20110112144803.824|20110112144805.058|TR0|Salazar and I, along with Kim 
20110112144805.058|20110112144806.293|TR0|Ives, went back for the sixth 
20110112144806.293|20110112144807.527|TR0|[six-month] anniversary. It was 
20110112144807.527|20110112144808.761|TR0|a ceremony they held, and then 
20110112144808.761|20110112144809.996|TR0|President Clinton gave a speech 
20110112144809.996|20110112144811.230|TR0|and talked about how important 
20110112144811.230|20110112144812.465|TR0|Haiti was to him.

20110112144814.933|20110112144816.168|TR0|spend the next seven weeks, 
20110112144816.168|20110112144817.402|TR0|except for the time it takes me 
20110112144817.402|20110112144818.637|TR0|to marry my daughter off, making 
20110112144818.637|20110112144819.871|TR0|sure the donors who have made 
20110112144819.871|20110112144821.105|TR0|these commitments give us a 
20110112144821.105|20110112144822.340|TR0|simple schedule: when will they 
20110112144822.340|20110112144823.574|TR0|deliver the money? How much and 
20110112144823.574|20110112144824.809|TR0|when? When they do, then we will 
20110112144824.809|20110112144826.043|TR0|get as much as we can for budget 
20110112144826.043|20110112144827.277|TR0|support for the Haiti 
20110112144827.277|20110112144828.512|TR0|government, and Prime Minister 
20110112144828.512|20110112144829.746|TR0|Bellerive and I will do 
20110112144829.746|20110112144830.981|TR0|everything we can to then push 
20110112144830.981|20110112144832.215|TR0|these projects through the 
20110112144832.215|20110112144833.450|TR0|reconstruction commission so the 
20110112144833.450|20110112144834.684|TR0|people of Haiti can feel and see 
20110112144834.684|20110112144835.918|TR0|them being done.

20110112144839.622|20110112144840.856|TR0|Port-au-Prince, standing in the 
20110112144840.856|20110112144842.090|TR0|shadow of the rubble of the 
20110112144842.090|20110112144843.325|TR0|palace, which at that point had 
20110112144843.325|20110112144844.559|TR0|hardly been touched, right in 
20110112144844.559|20110112144845.794|TR0|front of the Champ de Mars, 
20110112144845.794|20110112144847.028|TR0|where we were speaking to 
20110112144847.028|20110112144848.262|TR0|Patrick Elie today, the big 
20110112144848.262|20110112144849.497|TR0|plaza where thousands of Haitian 
20110112144849.497|20110112144850.731|TR0|refugees still live. Now less 
20110112144850.731|20110112144851.966|TR0|than 10 percent of the $9 
20110112144851.966|20110112144853.200|TR0|billion pledged by foreign 
20110112144853.200|20110112144854.434|TR0|donors has been delivered. It's 
20110112144854.434|20110112144855.669|TR0|six months after that speech, a 
20110112144855.669|20110112144856.903|TR0|year after the earthquake. 
20110112144856.903|20110112144858.138|TR0|Patrick Elie was just talking 
20110112144858.138|20110112144859.372|TR0|about the country being run by 
20110112144859.372|20110112144900.606|TR0|foreign interests. Is that your 
20110112144900.606|20110112144901.841|TR0|assessment, Edwidge Danticat?
20110112144901.841|20110112144903.075|TR0|
20110112144903.075|20110112144904.310|TR0|>> EDWIDGE DANTICAT: Well, there 
20110112144904.310|20110112144905.544|TR0|is certainly a lot of foreign 
20110112144905.544|20110112144906.778|TR0|interests here, you know, both, 
20110112144906.778|20110112144908.013|TR0|I think, in the NGO sector and 
20110112144908.013|20110112144909.247|TR0|the sort of potential inevitable 
20110112144909.247|20110112144910.482|TR0|flood of disaster capitalism 
20110112144910.482|20110112144911.716|TR0|that follows situations like 
20110112144911.716|20110112144912.951|TR0|this. I think we need to keep 
20110112144912.951|20110112144914.185|TR0|reminding not just the donors, 
20110112144914.185|20110112144915.419|TR0|but other witnesses, about this 
20110112144915.419|20110112144916.654|TR0|sort lack of [inaudible] you 
20110112144916.654|20110112144917.888|TR0|know, the pledges have been 
20110112144917.888|20110112144919.123|TR0|made, but that these have not 
20110112144919.123|20110112144920.357|TR0|been delivered, because often 
20110112144920.357|20110112144921.591|TR0|there's this impression that 
20110112144921.591|20110112144922.826|TR0|this has happened, and it's been 
20110112144922.826|20110112144924.060|TR0|consumed by corruption. But I 
20110112144924.060|20110112144925.295|TR0|think that's one thing we need 
20110112144925.295|20110112144926.529|TR0|to keep reminding other people. 
20110112144926.529|20110112144927.763|TR0|The foreign interests, I think, 
20110112144927.763|20110112144928.998|TR0|will always be there, but we 
20110112144928.998|20110112144930.232|TR0|also have to focus our attention 
20110112144930.232|20110112144931.467|TR0|on the Haitian people, as 
20110112144931.467|20110112144932.701|TR0|Patrick was just saying, on 
20110112144932.701|20110112144933.935|TR0|Haitian men and women who 
20110112144933.935|20110112144935.170|TR0|ultimately will be the ones to 
20110112144935.170|20110112144936.404|TR0|rebuild the country. And these 
20110112144936.404|20110112144937.639|TR0|donors and the NGOs and all the 
20110112144937.639|20110112144938.873|TR0|- even the disaster capitalists 
20110112144938.873|20110112144940.107|TR0|must remember that, that that's 
20110112144940.107|20110112144941.342|TR0|who will ultimately build this 
20110112144941.342|20110112144942.576|TR0|country, the men and women of 
20110112144942.576|20110112144943.811|TR0|this country. And they have the 
20110112144943.811|20110112144945.045|TR0|will. And sometimes they are 
20110112144945.045|20110112144946.280|TR0|portrayed as sort of passive 
20110112144946.280|20110112144947.514|TR0|receivers and not active enough. 
20110112144947.514|20110112144948.748|TR0|They have the will. They have 
20110112144948.748|20110112144949.983|TR0|the ability. All they need now 
20110112144949.983|20110112144951.217|TR0|is this opportunity by those 
20110112144951.217|20110112144952.452|TR0|both inside Haiti and outside of 
20110112144952.452|20110112144953.686|TR0|Haiti who control the purse 
20110112144953.686|20110112144954.920|TR0|strings of this country, that 
20110112144954.920|20110112144956.155|TR0|they have to remember that these 
20110112144956.155|20110112144957.389|TR0|men and women here need to be 
20110112144957.389|20110112144958.624|TR0|able, and want to and are 
20110112144958.624|20110112144959.858|TR0|willing to, rebuild their 
20110112144959.858|20110112145001.092|TR0|country, if they're given the 
20110112145001.092|20110112145002.327|TR0|opportunity to do so.

20110112145003.561|20110112145004.796|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Jean Saint-Vil, 
20110112145004.796|20110112145006.030|TR0|in Ottawa, your response to 
20110112145006.030|20110112145007.264|TR0|President Clinton saying this 
20110112145007.264|20110112145008.499|TR0|was his top priority, and also 
20110112145008.499|20110112145009.733|TR0|to the election, the Haiti 
20110112145009.733|20110112145010.968|TR0|Provisional Electoral Council 
20110112145010.968|20110112145012.202|TR0|releasing preliminary results 
20110112145012.202|20110112145013.436|TR0|and saying that Celestin is out 
20110112145013.436|20110112145014.671|TR0|and the runoff will be between 
20110112145014.671|20110112145015.905|TR0|the musician Michel Martelly and 
20110112145015.905|20110112145017.140|TR0|the former First Lady Mirlande 
20110112145017.140|20110112145018.374|TR0|Manigat, with Lavalas excluded 
20110112145018.374|20110112145019.609|TR0|from the election?
20110112145019.609|20110112145020.843|TR0|
20110112145020.843|20110112145022.077|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL: Yes, I think, 
20110112145022.077|20110112145023.312|TR0|again, in both of these 
20110112145023.312|20110112145024.546|TR0|instances, the key word is 
20110112145024.546|20110112145025.781|TR0|"accountability." If, five years 
20110112145025.781|20110112145027.015|TR0|from now, 10 years from now, 
20110112145027.015|20110112145028.249|TR0|President Clinton comes on TV 
20110112145028.249|20110112145029.484|TR0|and says, "Oops, I guess, you 
20110112145029.484|20110112145030.718|TR0|know, I did not succeed," what's 
20110112145030.718|20110112145031.953|TR0|going to happen? Nothing. 
20110112145031.953|20110112145033.187|TR0|President Clinton is not 
20110112145033.187|20110112145034.421|TR0|accountable to the people of 
20110112145034.421|20110112145035.656|TR0|Haiti. And this is exactly the 
20110112145035.656|20110112145036.890|TR0|challenge that Haitians are 
20110112145036.890|20110112145038.125|TR0|facing today. We have players 
20110112145038.125|20110112145039.359|TR0|who have lots of power, 
20110112145039.359|20110112145040.593|TR0|decision-making power, yet zero 
20110112145040.593|20110112145041.828|TR0|accountability, making the key 
20110112145041.828|20110112145043.062|TR0|decisions about the lives of 
20110112145043.062|20110112145044.297|TR0|Haitians, whether it is with 
20110112145044.297|20110112145045.531|TR0|regards to the reconstruction 
20110112145045.531|20110112145046.765|TR0|money or with the elections.
20110112145046.765|20110112145048.000|TR0|
20110112145048.000|20110112145049.234|TR0|We had a major scandal at the 
20110112145049.234|20110112145050.469|TR0|end of the year, where a 
20110112145050.469|20110112145051.703|TR0|Brazilian diplomat, Ricardo 
20110112145051.703|20110112145052.937|TR0|Seitenfus, came out and made a 
20110112145052.937|20110112145054.172|TR0|couple of interviews where he 
20110112145054.172|20110112145055.406|TR0|explained that not only did the 
20110112145055.406|20110112145056.641|TR0|international mission in Haiti 
20110112145056.641|20110112145057.875|TR0|fail, but that there are illegal 
20110112145057.875|20110112145059.110|TR0|things that are being discussed 
20110112145059.110|20110112145100.344|TR0|in plain sight. For instance, he 
20110112145100.344|20110112145101.578|TR0|mentioned that the day of the 
20110112145101.578|20110112145102.813|TR0|election, November 28th, he went 
20110112145102.813|20110112145104.047|TR0|into a meeting which involved 
20110112145104.047|20110112145105.282|TR0|the head of the U.N. mission in 
20110112145105.282|20110112145106.516|TR0|Haiti, Mr. Edmond Mulet, 
20110112145106.516|20110112145107.750|TR0|representatives of the donor 
20110112145107.750|20110112145108.985|TR0|countries - he didn't mention 
20110112145108.985|20110112145110.219|TR0|who they were  --  but they were 
20110112145110.219|20110112145111.454|TR0|discussing looking for a plane 
20110112145111.454|20110112145112.688|TR0|so they can put the current 
20110112145112.688|20110112145113.922|TR0|president of Haiti, Rene Preval, 
20110112145113.922|20110112145115.157|TR0|and expel him from the country. 
20110112145115.157|20110112145116.391|TR0|I mean, this is grave 
20110112145116.391|20110112145117.626|TR0|accusations from  --
20110112145117.626|20110112145118.860|TR0|
20110112145118.860|20110112145120.094|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Five seconds.

20110112145121.329|20110112145122.563|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL:  --  the OAS 
20110112145122.563|20110112145123.798|TR0|special representatives to 
20110112145123.798|20110112145125.032|TR0|Haiti. So I think what needs to 
20110112145125.032|20110112145126.266|TR0|happen is that people should 
20110112145126.266|20110112145127.501|TR0|play their key role. The U.N. 
20110112145127.501|20110112145128.735|TR0|must be forced to mobilize 
20110112145128.735|20110112145129.970|TR0|resources to fight cholera in 
20110112145129.970|20110112145131.204|TR0|Haiti. Whether they caused it or 
20110112145131.204|20110112145132.439|TR0|not, it is clear that the 
20110112145132.439|20110112145133.673|TR0|Nepalese camp near Bel Air was 
20110112145133.673|20110112145134.907|TR0|not treating their excrements 
20110112145134.907|20110112145136.142|TR0|the proper way. And  --

20110112145137.376|20110112145138.611|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We must leave it 
20110112145138.611|20110112145139.845|TR0|there, but we'll continue to 
20110112145139.845|20110112145141.079|TR0|follow Haiti, of course. Jean

20110112145223.049|20110112145224.284|TR0|I think [inaudible] people, both 
20110112145224.284|20110112145225.518|TR0|here in Haiti and in the Haitian 
20110112145225.518|20110112145226.752|TR0|diaspora today, we feel a great 
20110112145226.752|20110112145227.987|TR0|deal of sadness, because today 
20110112145227.987|20110112145229.221|TR0|we remember, you know, so many 
20110112145229.221|20110112145230.456|TR0|people that this country lost, 
20110112145230.456|20110112145231.690|TR0|so many people lost to us 
20110112145231.690|20110112145232.924|TR0|personally. So there's the sense 
20110112145232.924|20110112145234.159|TR0|of sadness, the sense of 
20110112145234.159|20110112145235.393|TR0|commemoration. Today here is a 
20110112145235.393|20110112145236.628|TR0|national holiday. Schools and 
20110112145236.628|20110112145237.862|TR0|offices are closed. But there's 
20110112145237.862|20110112145239.097|TR0|still - you know, the streets 
20110112145239.097|20110112145240.331|TR0|are busy. People are trying to 
20110112145240.331|20110112145241.565|TR0|go about their days, and even 
20110112145241.565|20110112145242.800|TR0|though there are many religious 
20110112145242.800|20110112145244.034|TR0|ceremonies and prayer services 
20110112145244.034|20110112145245.269|TR0|planned, small and large. But 
20110112145245.269|20110112145246.503|TR0|there's still a sense that, 
20110112145246.503|20110112145247.737|TR0|because people don't have any 
20110112145247.737|20110112145248.972|TR0|choice, you know, they still 
20110112145248.972|20110112145250.206|TR0|have to wake up today and go 
20110112145250.206|20110112145251.441|TR0|about the daily business of 
20110112145251.441|20110112145252.675|TR0|survival.

20110112145255.144|20110112145256.378|TR0|piece in the Miami Herald 
20110112145256.378|20110112145257.613|TR0|talking about the Greek myth 
20110112145257.613|20110112145258.847|TR0|Sisyphus. Can you take it from 
20110112145258.847|20110112145300.081|TR0|there?
20110112145300.081|20110112145301.316|TR0|
20110112145301.316|20110112145302.550|TR0|>> EDWIDGE DANTICAT: Well, you 
20110112145302.550|20110112145303.785|TR0|know, the most recent former 
20110112145303.785|20110112145305.019|TR0|prime minister of Haiti, Michele 
20110112145305.019|20110112145306.253|TR0|Pierre-Louis, and this Miami 
20110112145306.253|20110112145307.488|TR0|Herald-directed documentary 
20110112145307.488|20110112145308.722|TR0|called Nou Bouke  --  We Are 
20110112145308.722|20110112145309.957|TR0|Tired  --  talks about this myth 
20110112145309.957|20110112145311.191|TR0|of Sisyphus, of, you know, this 
20110112145311.191|20110112145312.425|TR0|Greek myth of someone rolling a 
20110112145312.425|20110112145313.660|TR0|rock up a hill and then finding 
20110112145313.660|20110112145314.894|TR0|that when you get up the hill, 
20110112145314.894|20110112145316.129|TR0|the rocks roll back down again, 
20110112145316.129|20110112145317.363|TR0|and it's a repetitive process. 
20110112145317.363|20110112145318.598|TR0|And the most sort of optimistic 
20110112145318.598|20110112145319.832|TR0|view of that story is that every 
20110112145319.832|20110112145321.066|TR0|time you do it, you think it's 
20110112145321.066|20110112145322.301|TR0|the last time. And she actually 
20110112145322.301|20110112145323.535|TR0|says it's an incredibly apt, at 
20110112145323.535|20110112145324.770|TR0|this moment, metaphor for Haiti 
20110112145324.770|20110112145326.004|TR0|and what Haitians are going 
20110112145326.004|20110112145327.238|TR0|through. But, you know, the 
20110112145327.238|20110112145328.473|TR0|upside of that is that - we've 
20110112145328.473|20110112145329.707|TR0|heard so much this year about 
20110112145329.707|20110112145330.942|TR0|it, in part because it's so true 
20110112145330.942|20110112145332.176|TR0|- Haitian people are very 
20110112145332.176|20110112145333.410|TR0|resilient. But it doesn't mean 
20110112145333.410|20110112145334.645|TR0|that they can, you know, suffer 
20110112145334.645|20110112145335.879|TR0|more than other people. And I 
20110112145335.879|20110112145337.114|TR0|think - and that's what also one 
20110112145337.114|20110112145338.348|TR0|needs to emphasize.
20110112145338.348|20110112145339.582|TR0|
20110112145339.582|20110112145340.817|TR0|A year later, there are a 
20110112145340.817|20110112145342.051|TR0|million-and-a-half people still 
20110112145342.051|20110112145343.286|TR0|living in tents. There's these 
20110112145343.286|20110112145344.520|TR0|reports of women being raped, 
20110112145344.520|20110112145345.754|TR0|and now, at this point, where 
20110112145345.754|20110112145346.989|TR0|some of the settlements are on 
20110112145346.989|20110112145348.223|TR0|private land and the owners are 
20110112145348.223|20110112145349.458|TR0|becoming tired of people being 
20110112145349.458|20110112145350.692|TR0|there and are intimidating them 
20110112145350.692|20110112145351.927|TR0|into relocating. So, even 
20110112145351.927|20110112145353.161|TR0|though, you know, there are 
20110112145353.161|20110112145354.395|TR0|still some great symbolic signs 
20110112145354.395|20110112145355.630|TR0|that we - for example, the 
20110112145355.630|20110112145356.864|TR0|reopening of the open market 
20110112145356.864|20110112145358.099|TR0|yesterday - but there's still a 
20110112145358.099|20110112145359.333|TR0|lot of suffering here. A lot of 
20110112145359.333|20110112145400.567|TR0|people are suffering. And as we 
20110112145400.567|20110112145401.802|TR0|remember the dead today, it's 
20110112145401.802|20110112145403.036|TR0|important to remember that, to 
20110112145403.036|20110112145404.271|TR0|this, there's a long suffering 
20110112145404.271|20110112145405.505|TR0|of the living that will continue 
20110112145405.505|20110112145406.739|TR0|past this day and to tomorrow 
20110112145406.739|20110112145407.974|TR0|and, sad to say, perhaps into 
20110112145407.974|20110112145409.208|TR0|next year and the following 
20110112145409.208|20110112145410.443|TR0|year. So we have to also 
20110112145410.443|20110112145411.677|TR0|remember the suffering of the 
20110112145411.677|20110112145412.911|TR0|living which continues here.

20110112145415.380|20110112145416.615|TR0|is affecting the people there, 
20110112145416.615|20110112145417.849|TR0|with some 3,600 people dead of 
20110112145417.849|20110112145419.083|TR0|cholera, 170,000 or so infected?
20110112145419.083|20110112145420.318|TR0|
20110112145420.318|20110112145421.552|TR0|>> EDWIDGE DANTICAT: Well, 
20110112145421.552|20110112145422.787|TR0|what's - there's been a stall in 
20110112145422.787|20110112145424.021|TR0|the conversation about cholera, 
20110112145424.021|20110112145425.256|TR0|in part because of the election 
20110112145425.256|20110112145426.490|TR0|stalemate here and as the 
20110112145426.490|20110112145427.724|TR0|anniversary is approaching, but 
20110112145427.724|20110112145428.959|TR0|it remains a very large problem. 
20110112145428.959|20110112145430.193|TR0|And potentially, you know, as 
20110112145430.193|20110112145431.428|TR0|the CDC and other organizations 
20110112145431.428|20110112145432.662|TR0|have declared, is that it can - 
20110112145432.662|20110112145433.896|TR0|cholera can potentially kill 
20110112145433.896|20110112145435.131|TR0|more people than the earthquake. 
20110112145435.131|20110112145436.365|TR0|And cholera can spread quickly, 
20110112145436.365|20110112145437.600|TR0|and has spread quickly in this 
20110112145437.600|20110112145438.834|TR0|country. And it was borne out of 
20110112145438.834|20110112145440.068|TR0|the circumstances that have been 
20110112145440.068|20110112145441.303|TR0|discussed, through - you know, 
20110112145441.303|20110112145442.537|TR0|whether one believes that it was 
20110112145442.537|20110112145443.772|TR0|through these Nepalese soldiers, 
20110112145443.772|20110112145445.006|TR0|but it can spread pretty 
20110112145445.006|20110112145446.240|TR0|quickly. And it's something 
20110112145446.240|20110112145447.475|TR0|also, as we look at these 
20110112145447.475|20110112145448.709|TR0|potential disasters, including 
20110112145448.709|20110112145449.944|TR0|the potential for lack of food 
20110112145449.944|20110112145451.178|TR0|security, because we have 
20110112145451.178|20110112145452.412|TR0|farmers in the Artibonite who 
20110112145452.412|20110112145453.647|TR0|refuse to go into the rice 
20110112145453.647|20110112145454.881|TR0|paddies, because they are afraid 
20110112145454.881|20110112145456.116|TR0|of the bacteria-infected waters 
20110112145456.116|20110112145457.350|TR0|there. So, there are a host of 
20110112145457.350|20110112145458.584|TR0|other issues also looming ahead, 
20110112145458.584|20110112145459.819|TR0|as we commemorate this day.

20110112145501.053|20110112145502.288|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I mean, the 
20110112145502.288|20110112145503.522|TR0|figures are stunning of how 
20110112145503.522|20110112145504.757|TR0|little money has made it to 
20110112145504.757|20110112145505.991|TR0|reconstruction in this year, of 
20110112145505.991|20110112145507.225|TR0|the $9 billion promised. I 
20110112145507.225|20110112145508.460|TR0|wanted to play for you a clip of 
20110112145508.460|20110112145509.694|TR0|President Clinton. I know he is 
20110112145509.694|20110112145510.929|TR0|back in Haiti right now. We were 
20110112145510.929|20110112145512.163|TR0|there right after the 
20110112145512.163|20110112145513.397|TR0|earthquake, and then Sharif 
20110112145513.397|20110112145514.632|TR0|Abdel Kouddous and Nicole 
20110112145514.632|20110112145515.866|TR0|Salazar and I, along with Kim 
20110112145515.866|20110112145517.101|TR0|Ives, went back for the sixth 
20110112145517.101|20110112145518.335|TR0|[six-month] anniversary. It was 
20110112145518.335|20110112145519.569|TR0|a ceremony they held, and then 
20110112145519.569|20110112145520.804|TR0|President Clinton gave a speech 
20110112145520.804|20110112145522.038|TR0|and talked about how important 
20110112145522.038|20110112145523.273|TR0|Haiti was to him.

20110112145524.507|20110112145525.741|TR0|>> BILL CLINTON: I intend to 
20110112145525.741|20110112145526.976|TR0|spend the next seven weeks, 
20110112145526.976|20110112145528.210|TR0|except for the time it takes me 
20110112145528.210|20110112145529.445|TR0|to marry my daughter off, making 
20110112145529.445|20110112145530.679|TR0|sure the donors who have made 
20110112145530.679|20110112145531.913|TR0|these commitments give us a 
20110112145531.913|20110112145533.148|TR0|simple schedule: when will they 
20110112145533.148|20110112145534.382|TR0|deliver the money? How much and 
20110112145534.382|20110112145535.617|TR0|when? When they do, then we will 
20110112145535.617|20110112145536.851|TR0|get as much as we can for budget 
20110112145536.851|20110112145538.086|TR0|support for the Haiti 
20110112145538.086|20110112145539.320|TR0|government, and Prime Minister 
20110112145539.320|20110112145540.554|TR0|Bellerive and I will do 
20110112145540.554|20110112145541.789|TR0|everything we can to then push 
20110112145541.789|20110112145543.023|TR0|these projects through the 
20110112145543.023|20110112145544.258|TR0|reconstruction commission so the 
20110112145544.258|20110112145545.492|TR0|people of Haiti can feel and see 
20110112145545.492|20110112145546.726|TR0|them being done.
20110112145546.726|20110112145547.961|TR0|
20110112145547.961|20110112145549.195|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was 
20110112145549.195|20110112145550.430|TR0|President Clinton in 
20110112145550.430|20110112145551.664|TR0|Port-au-Prince, standing in the 
20110112145551.664|20110112145552.898|TR0|shadow of the rubble of the 
20110112145552.898|20110112145554.133|TR0|palace, which at that point had 
20110112145554.133|20110112145555.367|TR0|hardly been touched, right in 
20110112145555.367|20110112145556.602|TR0|front of the Champ de Mars, 
20110112145556.602|20110112145557.836|TR0|where we were speaking to 
20110112145557.836|20110112145559.070|TR0|Patrick Elie today, the big 
20110112145559.070|20110112145600.305|TR0|plaza where thousands of Haitian 
20110112145600.305|20110112145601.539|TR0|refugees still live. Now less 
20110112145601.539|20110112145602.774|TR0|than 10 percent of the $9 
20110112145602.774|20110112145604.008|TR0|billion pledged by foreign 
20110112145604.008|20110112145605.242|TR0|donors has been delivered. It's 
20110112145605.242|20110112145606.477|TR0|six months after that speech, a 
20110112145606.477|20110112145607.711|TR0|year after the earthquake. 
20110112145607.711|20110112145608.946|TR0|Patrick Elie was just talking 
20110112145608.946|20110112145610.180|TR0|about the country being run by 
20110112145610.180|20110112145611.415|TR0|foreign interests. Is that your 
20110112145611.415|20110112145612.649|TR0|assessment, Edwidge Danticat?
20110112145612.649|20110112145613.883|TR0|
20110112145613.883|20110112145615.118|TR0|>> EDWIDGE DANTICAT: Well, there 
20110112145615.118|20110112145616.352|TR0|is certainly a lot of foreign 
20110112145616.352|20110112145617.587|TR0|interests here, you know, both, 
20110112145617.587|20110112145618.821|TR0|I think, in the NGO sector and 
20110112145618.821|20110112145620.055|TR0|the sort of potential inevitable 
20110112145620.055|20110112145621.290|TR0|flood of disaster capitalism 
20110112145621.290|20110112145622.524|TR0|that follows situations like 
20110112145622.524|20110112145623.759|TR0|this. I think we need to keep 
20110112145623.759|20110112145624.993|TR0|reminding not just the donors, 
20110112145624.993|20110112145626.227|TR0|but other witnesses, about this 
20110112145626.227|20110112145627.462|TR0|sort lack of [inaudible] you 
20110112145627.462|20110112145628.696|TR0|know, the pledges have been 
20110112145628.696|20110112145629.931|TR0|made, but that these have not 
20110112145629.931|20110112145631.165|TR0|been delivered, because often 
20110112145631.165|20110112145632.399|TR0|there's this impression that 
20110112145632.399|20110112145633.634|TR0|this has happened, and it's been 
20110112145633.634|20110112145634.868|TR0|consumed by corruption. But I 
20110112145634.868|20110112145636.103|TR0|think that's one thing we need 
20110112145636.103|20110112145637.337|TR0|to keep reminding other people. 
20110112145637.337|20110112145638.571|TR0|The foreign interests, I think, 
20110112145638.571|20110112145639.806|TR0|will always be there, but we 
20110112145639.806|20110112145641.040|TR0|also have to focus our attention 
20110112145641.040|20110112145642.275|TR0|on the Haitian people, as 
20110112145642.275|20110112145643.509|TR0|Patrick was just saying, on 
20110112145643.509|20110112145644.743|TR0|Haitian men and women who 
20110112145644.743|20110112145645.978|TR0|ultimately will be the ones to 
20110112145645.978|20110112145647.212|TR0|rebuild the country. And these 
20110112145647.212|20110112145648.447|TR0|donors and the NGOs and all the 
20110112145648.447|20110112145649.681|TR0|- even the disaster capitalists 
20110112145649.681|20110112145650.916|TR0|must remember that, that that's 
20110112145650.916|20110112145652.150|TR0|who will ultimately build this 
20110112145652.150|20110112145653.384|TR0|country, the men and women of 
20110112145653.384|20110112145654.619|TR0|this country. And they have the 
20110112145654.619|20110112145655.853|TR0|will. And sometimes they are 
20110112145655.853|20110112145657.088|TR0|portrayed as sort of passive 
20110112145657.088|20110112145658.322|TR0|receivers and not active enough. 
20110112145658.322|20110112145659.556|TR0|They have the will. They have 
20110112145659.556|20110112145700.791|TR0|the ability. All they need now 
20110112145700.791|20110112145702.025|TR0|is this opportunity by those 
20110112145702.025|20110112145703.260|TR0|both inside Haiti and outside of 
20110112145703.260|20110112145704.494|TR0|Haiti who control the purse 
20110112145704.494|20110112145705.728|TR0|strings of this country, that 
20110112145705.728|20110112145706.963|TR0|they have to remember that these 
20110112145706.963|20110112145708.197|TR0|men and women here need to be 
20110112145708.197|20110112145709.432|TR0|able, and want to and are 
20110112145709.432|20110112145710.666|TR0|willing to, rebuild their 
20110112145710.666|20110112145711.900|TR0|country, if they're given the 
20110112145711.900|20110112145713.135|TR0|opportunity to do so.
20110112145713.135|20110112145714.369|TR0|
20110112145714.369|20110112145715.604|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Jean Saint-Vil, 
20110112145715.604|20110112145716.838|TR0|in Ottawa, your response to 
20110112145716.838|20110112145718.072|TR0|President Clinton saying this 
20110112145718.072|20110112145719.307|TR0|was his top priority, and also 
20110112145719.307|20110112145720.541|TR0|to the election, the Haiti 
20110112145720.541|20110112145721.776|TR0|Provisional Electoral Council 
20110112145721.776|20110112145723.010|TR0|releasing preliminary results 
20110112145723.010|20110112145724.245|TR0|and saying that Celestin is out 
20110112145724.245|20110112145725.479|TR0|and the runoff will be between 
20110112145725.479|20110112145726.713|TR0|the musician Michel Martelly and 
20110112145726.713|20110112145727.948|TR0|the former First Lady Mirlande 
20110112145727.948|20110112145729.182|TR0|Manigat, with Lavalas excluded 
20110112145729.182|20110112145730.417|TR0|from the election?
20110112145730.417|20110112145731.651|TR0|
20110112145731.651|20110112145732.885|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL: Yes, I think, 
20110112145732.885|20110112145734.120|TR0|again, in both of these 
20110112145734.120|20110112145735.354|TR0|instances, the key word is 
20110112145735.354|20110112145736.589|TR0|"accountability." If, five years 
20110112145736.589|20110112145737.823|TR0|from now, 10 years from now, 
20110112145737.823|20110112145739.057|TR0|President Clinton comes on TV 
20110112145739.057|20110112145740.292|TR0|and says, "Oops, I guess, you 
20110112145740.292|20110112145741.526|TR0|know, I did not succeed," what's 
20110112145741.526|20110112145742.761|TR0|going to happen? Nothing. 
20110112145742.761|20110112145743.995|TR0|President Clinton is not 
20110112145743.995|20110112145745.229|TR0|accountable to the people of 
20110112145745.229|20110112145746.464|TR0|Haiti. And this is exactly the 
20110112145746.464|20110112145747.698|TR0|challenge that Haitians are 
20110112145747.698|20110112145748.933|TR0|facing today. We have players 
20110112145748.933|20110112145750.167|TR0|who have lots of power, 
20110112145750.167|20110112145751.401|TR0|decision-making power, yet zero 
20110112145751.401|20110112145752.636|TR0|accountability, making the key 
20110112145752.636|20110112145753.870|TR0|decisions about the lives of 
20110112145753.870|20110112145755.105|TR0|Haitians, whether it is with 
20110112145755.105|20110112145756.339|TR0|regards to the reconstruction 
20110112145756.339|20110112145757.574|TR0|money or with the elections.
20110112145757.574|20110112145758.808|TR0|
20110112145758.808|20110112145800.042|TR0|We had a major scandal at the 
20110112145800.042|20110112145801.277|TR0|end of the year, where a 
20110112145801.277|20110112145802.511|TR0|Brazilian diplomat, Ricardo 
20110112145802.511|20110112145803.746|TR0|Seitenfus, came out and made a 
20110112145803.746|20110112145804.980|TR0|couple of interviews where he 
20110112145804.980|20110112145806.214|TR0|explained that not only did the 
20110112145806.214|20110112145807.449|TR0|international mission in Haiti 
20110112145807.449|20110112145808.683|TR0|fail, but that there are illegal 
20110112145808.683|20110112145809.918|TR0|things that are being discussed 
20110112145809.918|20110112145811.152|TR0|in plain sight. For instance, he 
20110112145811.152|20110112145812.386|TR0|mentioned that the day of the 
20110112145812.386|20110112145813.621|TR0|election, November 28th, he went 
20110112145813.621|20110112145814.855|TR0|into a meeting which involved 
20110112145814.855|20110112145816.090|TR0|the head of the U.N. mission in 
20110112145816.090|20110112145817.324|TR0|Haiti, Mr. Edmond Mulet, 
20110112145817.324|20110112145818.558|TR0|representatives of the donor 
20110112145818.558|20110112145819.793|TR0|countries - he didn't mention 
20110112145819.793|20110112145821.027|TR0|who they were  --  but they were 
20110112145821.027|20110112145822.262|TR0|discussing looking for a plane 
20110112145822.262|20110112145823.496|TR0|so they can put the current 
20110112145823.496|20110112145824.730|TR0|president of Haiti, Rene Preval, 
20110112145824.730|20110112145825.965|TR0|and expel him from the country. 
20110112145825.965|20110112145827.199|TR0|I mean, this is grave 
20110112145827.199|20110112145828.434|TR0|accusations from  --
20110112145828.434|20110112145829.668|TR0|
20110112145829.668|20110112145830.902|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Five seconds.
20110112145830.902|20110112145832.137|TR0|
20110112145832.137|20110112145833.371|TR0|>> JEAN SAINT-VIL:  --  the OAS 
20110112145833.371|20110112145834.606|TR0|special representatives to 
20110112145834.606|20110112145835.840|TR0|Haiti. So I think what needs to 
20110112145835.840|20110112145837.075|TR0|happen is that people should 
20110112145837.075|20110112145838.309|TR0|play their key role. The U.N. 
20110112145838.309|20110112145839.543|TR0|must be forced to mobilize 
20110112145839.543|20110112145840.778|TR0|resources to fight cholera in 
20110112145840.778|20110112145842.012|TR0|Haiti. Whether they caused it or 
20110112145842.012|20110112145843.247|TR0|not, it is clear that the 
20110112145843.247|20110112145844.481|TR0|Nepalese camp near Bel Air was 
20110112145844.481|20110112145845.715|TR0|not treating their excrements 
20110112145845.715|20110112145846.950|TR0|the proper way. And  --
20110112145846.950|20110112145848.184|TR0|
20110112145848.184|20110112145849.419|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We must leave it
