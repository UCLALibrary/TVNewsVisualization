20110126014711.000|20110126014713.000|CC1|BABY'S BIO DAD, BUT ISN'T IT

20110126014722.000|20110126014726.000|CC1|>> THAT WAS THE TESTIMONY OF HER

20110126014728.000|20110126014730.000|CC1|OF COURSE, NANCY, AS YOU KNOW,  
20110126014730.000|20110126014733.000|CC1|THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO

20110126014748.000|20110126014749.000|CC1|MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE.             
20110126014749.000|20110126014750.000|CC1|YES, THEY SEND MESSAGES THROUGH 
20110126014750.000|20110126014751.000|CC1|OTHER PEOPLE.                   
20110126014751.000|20110126014802.000|CC1|THEY'RE FAMOUS FOR THREE WAYS.  
20110126014802.000|20110126014805.000|CC1|THEY SEND LETTERS, YOU'RE RIGHT,
20110126014805.000|20110126014806.000|CC1|THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO    
20110126014806.000|20110126014811.000|CC1|SKIN A CAT, ARTHUR HORN.        
20110126014811.000|20110126014814.000|CC1|BUT THERE'S STILL THE CONUNDRUM 
20110126014814.000|20110126014816.000|CC1|THAT SHE WANTS A JURY, BECAUSE  
20110126014816.000|20110126014817.000|CC1|SHE'S LOCKED INTO HER STATEMENT 
20110126014817.000|20110126014819.000|CC1|NOW, TO BELIEVE SHE HANDED THE  
20110126014819.000|20110126014820.000|CC1|BABY OVER TO A WOMAN SHE NEVER  
20110126014820.000|20110126014824.000|CC1|MET AND DIDN'T KNOW.            
20110126014824.000|20110126014825.000|CC1|WELL, AGAIN, THE EVIDENCE --    
20110126014825.000|20110126014827.000|CC1|THERE'S NO EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE
20110126014827.000|20110126014835.000|CC1|THAT PROVES THAT THERE'S ANY    
20110126014835.000|20110126014836.000|CC1|INJURY, SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO
20110126014836.000|20110126014838.000|CC1|THE CHILD OR THERE'S NEVER BEEN 
20110126014838.000|20110126014840.000|CC1|A BODY PRODUCED TO SHOW THAT    
20110126014840.000|20110126014841.000|CC1|LAUREN HAS BEEN MURDERED.       
20110126014841.000|20110126014844.000|CC1|>> YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT TOO,

20110126014848.000|20110126014850.000|CC1|HAVE SINCE THERE'S A FORMAL     
20110126014850.000|20110126014853.000|CC1|INDICTMENT, GIVEN YOU DISCOVERY,
20110126014853.000|20110126014856.000|CC1|HAS THE STATE GIVEN YOU         
20110126014856.000|20110126014856.000|CC1|DISCOVERY?                      
20110126014856.000|20110126014859.000|CC1|UNDER OUR LAW, THEY'VE GOT TO   
20110126014859.000|20110126014900.000|CC1|GIVE YOU ALL SCIENTIFIC

20110126014903.000|20110126014904.000|CC1|THE HOME?                       
20110126014904.000|20110126014904.000|CC1|>> SURE.                        
20110126014904.000|20110126014907.000|CC1|WE'RE NOT AT THAT STAGE IN THE  
20110126014907.000|20110126014907.000|CC1|PROCEEDINGS.                    
20110126014907.000|20110126014909.000|CC1|WE'VE HAD A PRELIMINARY HEARING.
20110126014909.000|20110126014912.000|CC1|WE FELT LIKE AT THE PRELIMINARY 
20110126014912.000|20110126014914.000|CC1|HEARING THAT WAS HELD BASED ON  
20110126014914.000|20110126014916.000|CC1|THE AGGRAVATED CHILD NEGLECT,   
20110126014916.000|20110126014920.000|CC1|AND ENDANGERMENT CHARGE, WE FELT
20110126014920.000|20110126014924.000|CC1|LIKE THEY BARELY WERE ABLE TO   
20110126014924.000|20110126014925.000|CC1|PROVE PROBABLE CAUSE, BECAUSE   
20110126014925.000|20110126014928.000|CC1|THEY WERE REALLY UNABLE TO PROVE
20110126014928.000|20110126014930.000|CC1|SERIOUS BODILY INJURY.          
20110126014930.000|20110126014931.000|CC1|NOW I FIND OUT YESTERDAY THAT   
20110126014931.000|20110126014933.000|CC1|THEY'VE INDICTED HER ON FIRST   
20110126014933.000|20110126014934.000|CC1|DEGREE MURDER.                  
20110126014934.000|20110126014937.000|CC1|AND I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY NEW    
20110126014937.000|20110126014939.000|CC1|EVIDENCE THAT THE STATE HAS     
20110126014939.000|20110126014940.000|CC1|RECEIVED OR FOUND --            
20110126014940.000|20110126014942.000|CC1|>> WELL, ARTHUR HORN, AT THAT   
20110126014942.000|20110126014944.000|CC1|PRELIMINARY HEARING, THEY PUT UP
20110126014944.000|20110126014945.000|CC1|EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT THEY FOUND

20110126014946.000|20110126014948.000|CC1|WHAT DID THEY TELL THE JUDGE?   
20110126014948.000|20110126014949.000|CC1|>> WHAT DID THEY TELL THE JUDGE?
20110126014949.000|20110126014952.000|CC1|>> UH-HUH.                      
20110126014952.000|20110126014954.000|CC1|>> I MEAN, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE
20110126014954.000|20110126014956.000|CC1|PRODUCED AT THAT HEARING THAT   
20110126014956.000|20110126014957.000|CC1|THERE WAS SERIOUS BODILY INJURY 
20110126014957.000|20110126014959.000|CC1|DONE TO THAT CHILD.             
20110126014959.000|20110126015001.000|CC1|>> WHAT BLOOD EVIDENCE DID THEY 
20110126015001.000|20110126015002.000|CC1|FIND IN YOUR CLIENT'S HOME IS   
20110126015002.000|20110126015006.000|CC1|WHAT I'M ASKING YOU?            
20110126015006.000|20110126015007.000|CC1|>> WELL, I YOU?                 
20110126015007.000|20110126015011.000|CC1|>> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK, AGAIN,
20110126015011.000|20110126015013.000|CC1|THEY WERE GOING ON THE          
20110126015013.000|20110126015015.000|CC1|ASSUMPTION IF SOMEONE HANDS OFF 
20110126015015.000|20110126015016.000|CC1|THEIR CHILD TO ANOTHER PERSON   
20110126015016.000|20110126015018.000|CC1|THAT THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR A
20110126015018.000|20110126015019.000|CC1|YOUNG CHILD TO HAVE SERIOUS     
20110126015019.000|20110126015020.000|CC1|BODILY INJURY.                  
20110126015020.000|20110126015022.000|CC1|AND I THINK THAT WAS ENOUGH TO  
20110126015022.000|20110126015025.000|CC1|GET PROBABLE CAUSE, AGAIN,      
20110126015025.000|20110126015027.000|CC1|NANCY, AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S A

20110126015037.000|20110126015038.000|CC1|>> WELL OBVIOUSLY THE GRAND JURY
20110126015038.000|20110126015040.000|CC1|DID HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO     
20110126015040.000|20110126015041.000|CC1|INDICT IT BECAUSE THAT WAS THEIR
20110126015041.000|20110126015042.000|CC1|TRUE BILL.                      
20110126015042.000|20110126015044.000|CC1|THEY HANDED DOWN A TRUE BILL.

20110126015103.000|20110126015107.000|CC1|BECAUSE OF THIS ZANADA SHARADA. 
20110126015107.000|20110126015110.000|CC1|IT'S LIKE A GRENADEA.
