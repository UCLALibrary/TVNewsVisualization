20110126010007.000|20110126010009.000|TR0|WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  We want to 
20110126010009.000|20110126010011.000|TR0|welcome our viewers here in the United 
20110126010011.000|20110126010013.000|TR0|States and around the world.  I'm Wolf 
20110126010013.000|20110126010015.000|TR0|Blitzer.
20110126010015.000|20110126010017.000|TR0|
20110126010017.000|20110126010019.000|TR0|We're one hour away from the president of 
20110126010019.000|20110126010021.000|TR0|the United States delivering the State of 
20110126010021.000|20110126010023.000|TR0|the Union address before a joint session 
20110126010023.000|20110126010025.000|TR0|of the United States Congress.
20110126010025.000|20110126010027.000|TR0|
20110126010027.000|20110126010030.000|TR0|Pretty soon people will start walking in 
20110126010030.000|20110126010032.000|TR0|to the House of Representatives on the 
20110126010032.000|20110126010034.000|TR0|floor.  Members of the diplomatic corps, 
20110126010034.000|20110126010036.000|TR0|members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
20110126010036.000|20110126010038.000|TR0|members of the United States Supreme 
20110126010038.000|20110126010040.000|TR0|Court, and of course the senators and the 
20110126010040.000|20110126010042.000|TR0|representatives, the new Republican 
20110126010042.000|20110126010044.000|TR0|majority in the House of Representatives, 
20110126010044.000|20110126010046.000|TR0|and the still Democratic majority, albeit 
20110126010046.000|20110126010048.000|TR0|a smaller one, in the United States Senate.
20110126010048.000|20110126010050.000|TR0|
20110126010050.000|20110126010053.000|TR0|This is an important speech for the 
20110126010053.000|20110126010055.000|TR0|president.  He'll speak for probably 
20110126010055.000|20110126010057.000|TR0|around an hour.  Almost all of it will 
20110126010057.000|20110126010059.000|TR0|deal with domestic issues -- jobs, jobs, 
20110126010059.000|20110126010101.000|TR0|jobs, the U.S. economy.  He will touch on 
20110126010101.000|20110126010103.000|TR0|some foreign policy issues like 
20110126010103.000|20110126010105.000|TR0|Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran.  But most 
20110126010105.000|20110126010107.000|TR0|of the speech will deal with the 
20110126010107.000|20110126010109.000|TR0|bread-and-butter issues, what's facing the 
20110126010109.000|20110126010111.000|TR0|United States right now and how to improve 
20110126010111.000|20110126010113.000|TR0|the economy.
20110126010113.000|20110126010116.000|TR0|
20110126010116.000|20110126010118.000|TR0|We have our reporters and our analysts.  
20110126010118.000|20110126010120.000|TR0|They are all standing by.  Let's walk over 
20110126010120.000|20110126010122.000|TR0|to some members of the best political team 
20110126010122.000|20110126010124.000|TR0|on television.
20110126010124.000|20110126010126.000|TR0|
20110126010126.000|20110126010128.000|TR0|And Candy Crowley, you're here right now.  
20110126010128.000|20110126010130.000|TR0|What does the president of the United 
20110126010130.000|20110126010132.000|TR0|States need to accomplish in this one 
20110126010132.000|20110126010134.000|TR0|speech tonight?
20110126010134.000|20110126010136.000|TR0|
20110126010136.000|20110126010139.000|TR0|CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110126010139.000|20110126010141.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  He -- I mean politically 
20110126010141.000|20110126010143.000|TR0|speaking, he needs to bring back the 
20110126010143.000|20110126010145.000|TR0|independents who are already beginning to 
20110126010145.000|20110126010147.000|TR0|drift back to him as we're seeing in the 
20110126010147.000|20110126010149.000|TR0|polling. I think this is a speech that 
20110126010149.000|20110126010151.000|TR0|totally and -- sort of reminding them of 
20110126010151.000|20110126010153.000|TR0|the Barack Obama that they voted into 
20110126010153.000|20110126010155.000|TR0|office.
20110126010155.000|20110126010157.000|TR0|
20110126010157.000|20110126010200.000|TR0|I think that's the most important thing he 
20110126010200.000|20110126010202.000|TR0|needs to do.  Because these things about 
20110126010202.000|20110126010204.000|TR0|well, we're going to freeze this or freeze 
20110126010204.000|20110126010206.000|TR0|that, by tomorrow morning, there will be 
20110126010206.000|20110126010208.000|TR0|23 other ideas on the table.  So I think 
20110126010208.000|20110126010210.000|TR0|this is about the totality of the speech 
20110126010210.000|20110126010212.000|TR0|and the feel of it, frankly.
20110126010212.000|20110126010214.000|TR0|
20110126010214.000|20110126010216.000|TR0|BLITZER:  David Gergen, the president 
20110126010216.000|20110126010218.000|TR0|invited you not that long ago, only a few 
20110126010218.000|20110126010220.000|TR0|weeks ago to come in with some other elder 
20110126010220.000|20110126010223.000|TR0|statesmen, if you will.  People who have 
20110126010223.000|20110126010225.000|TR0|experience.  You served four U.S. 
20110126010225.000|20110126010227.000|TR0|presidents, Democrats and Republicans.
20110126010227.000|20110126010229.000|TR0|
20110126010229.000|20110126010231.000|TR0|You're not going to tell us what he said 
20110126010231.000|20110126010233.000|TR0|to you because it was off the record.  But 
20110126010233.000|20110126010235.000|TR0|tell us what advice you gave the president.
20110126010235.000|20110126010237.000|TR0|
20110126010237.000|20110126010239.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110126010239.000|20110126010241.000|TR0|ANALYST:  Well, I actually -- I do want to 
20110126010241.000|20110126010243.000|TR0|protect him.  And by the way, I also 
20110126010243.000|20110126010246.000|TR0|talked to Republican leaders about things 
20110126010246.000|20110126010248.000|TR0|like this.  But the point was, I felt that 
20110126010248.000|20110126010250.000|TR0|what he did in Winston-Salem a couple of 
20110126010250.000|20110126010252.000|TR0|months ago in talking about a U.S. 
20110126010252.000|20110126010254.000|TR0|competitiveness was a very, very important 
20110126010254.000|20110126010256.000|TR0|theme.
20110126010256.000|20110126010258.000|TR0|
20110126010258.000|20110126010300.000|TR0|And that I did think that for too long 
20110126010300.000|20110126010302.000|TR0|we've neglected the question of how jobs 
20110126010302.000|20110126010304.000|TR0|are disappearing and what we need to do at 
20110126010304.000|20110126010306.000|TR0|home in science and math in getting our 
20110126010306.000|20110126010309.000|TR0|kids trained up and stopping this outflow 
20110126010309.000|20110126010311.000|TR0|of jobs.
20110126010311.000|20110126010313.000|TR0|
20110126010313.000|20110126010315.000|TR0|And we had a long discussion about that.  
20110126010315.000|20110126010317.000|TR0|And I'm very delighted tonight that he is 
20110126010317.000|20110126010319.000|TR0|-- that he is going to build upon that 
20110126010319.000|20110126010321.000|TR0|theme.  I think he does need to change the 
20110126010321.000|20110126010323.000|TR0|conversation.  I think that both a 
20110126010323.000|20110126010325.000|TR0|political speech -- but it's a pivot in 
20110126010325.000|20110126010327.000|TR0|his administration.  Two years of fighting 
20110126010327.000|20110126010330.000|TR0|what he inherited.
20110126010330.000|20110126010332.000|TR0|
20110126010332.000|20110126010334.000|TR0|Now what stamp is he going to put on the 
20110126010334.000|20110126010336.000|TR0|future?  This is why he needs a big theme 
20110126010336.000|20110126010338.000|TR0|tonight.
20110126010338.000|20110126010340.000|TR0|
20110126010340.000|20110126010342.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I know, Eliot Spitzer, the 
20110126010342.000|20110126010344.000|TR0|president has been studying Ronald Reagan, 
20110126010344.000|20110126010346.000|TR0|how he did it, how he connected with the 
20110126010346.000|20110126010348.000|TR0|American public.  He's been studying Bill 
20110126010348.000|20110126010350.000|TR0|Clinton, how he connected, all of us 
20110126010350.000|20110126010353.000|TR0|remember Bill Clinton.
20110126010353.000|20110126010355.000|TR0|
20110126010355.000|20110126010357.000|TR0|ELIOT SPITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  Right.
20110126010357.000|20110126010359.000|TR0|
20110126010359.000|20110126010401.000|TR0|BLITZER:  When he used to say I feel your 
20110126010401.000|20110126010403.000|TR0|pain.  That's one area that I think he 
20110126010403.000|20110126010405.000|TR0|himself would acknowledge he needs some 
20110126010405.000|20110126010407.000|TR0|work.
20110126010407.000|20110126010409.000|TR0|
20110126010409.000|20110126010411.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, he -- traditionally the 
20110126010411.000|20110126010413.000|TR0|first two years did not do well connecting 
20110126010413.000|20110126010416.000|TR0|emotionally with the public.  On the other 
20110126010416.000|20110126010418.000|TR0|hand, his speech at Tucson was even -- the 
20110126010418.000|20110126010420.000|TR0|setting was obviously one of mourning -- 
20110126010420.000|20110126010422.000|TR0|was one where we looked to him and we felt 
20110126010422.000|20110126010424.000|TR0|that empathy. We felt the sympathy.  He 
20110126010424.000|20110126010426.000|TR0|did reach out to the public.
20110126010426.000|20110126010428.000|TR0|
20110126010428.000|20110126010430.000|TR0|Since Election Day in November when he 
20110126010430.000|20110126010432.000|TR0|suffered the shellacking that he 
20110126010432.000|20110126010434.000|TR0|described, we have been going back to him. 
20110126010434.000|20110126010436.000|TR0| I describe it partially to buyer's 
20110126010436.000|20110126010439.000|TR0|remorse now that we're beginning to see 
20110126010439.000|20110126010441.000|TR0|what the Republican Party really stands 
20110126010441.000|20110126010443.000|TR0|for.  But also of course, as David has 
20110126010443.000|20110126010445.000|TR0|said, he has been pivoting very much more 
20110126010445.000|20110126010447.000|TR0|towards the middle, striking themes that I 
20110126010447.000|20110126010449.000|TR0|don't necessarily agree with.
20110126010449.000|20110126010451.000|TR0|
20110126010451.000|20110126010453.000|TR0|But he -- because he has been embracing 
20110126010453.000|20110126010455.000|TR0|the Republican agenda, but he has been 
20110126010455.000|20110126010457.000|TR0|moving very quickly to the middle, getting 
20110126010457.000|20110126010500.000|TR0|back those independent voters.  And the 
20110126010500.000|20110126010502.000|TR0|tone tonight will be very much that he is 
20110126010502.000|20110126010504.000|TR0|the centrist.  He will govern and say to 
20110126010504.000|20110126010506.000|TR0|people come to me, let me lead this nation 
20110126010506.000|20110126010508.000|TR0|back to the middle where we need to be.
20110126010508.000|20110126010510.000|TR0|
20110126010510.000|20110126010512.000|TR0|BLITZER:  His job approval numbers have 
20110126010512.000|20110126010514.000|TR0|certainly gone up.
20110126010514.000|20110126010516.000|TR0|
20110126010516.000|20110126010518.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Absolutely.       BLITZER:  
20110126010518.000|20110126010520.000|TR0|Since the shellacking that the Democrats 
20110126010520.000|20110126010523.000|TR0|took in the midterm elections.
20110126010523.000|20110126010525.000|TR0|
20110126010525.000|20110126010527.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110126010527.000|20110126010529.000|TR0|
20110126010529.000|20110126010531.000|TR0|BLITZER:  In early November.  Joe Johns 
20110126010531.000|20110126010533.000|TR0|has been taking a closer look at some of 
20110126010533.000|20110126010535.000|TR0|those numbers.
20110126010535.000|20110126010537.000|TR0|
20110126010537.000|20110126010539.000|TR0|Joe, walk us through because he's doing 
20110126010539.000|20110126010541.000|TR0|relatively well right now.
20110126010541.000|20110126010543.000|TR0|
20110126010543.000|20110126010546.000|TR0|JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  He 
20110126010546.000|20110126010548.000|TR0|has, but he's had a very tough slog, if 
20110126010548.000|20110126010550.000|TR0|you look at it, Wolf.  Obviously it all 
20110126010550.000|20110126010552.000|TR0|starts right after he was inaugurated.
20110126010552.000|20110126010554.000|TR0|
20110126010554.000|20110126010556.000|TR0|Let's talk about February of 2009.  The 
20110126010556.000|20110126010558.000|TR0|president has very high approval ratings.  
20110126010558.000|20110126010600.000|TR0|And then after that he starts having 
20110126010600.000|20110126010602.000|TR0|problems. It's the summer -- it's a summer 
20110126010602.000|20110126010604.000|TR0|of discontent in 2009 the Tea Party 
20110126010604.000|20110126010606.000|TR0|emerges.  It doesn't help him.
20110126010606.000|20110126010609.000|TR0|
20110126010609.000|20110126010611.000|TR0|We move on to December.  That's when the 
20110126010611.000|20110126010613.000|TR0|health care debate begins.  It doesn't 
20110126010613.000|20110126010615.000|TR0|help him again.  Over to March when he 
20110126010615.000|20110126010617.000|TR0|signs the health care.  Another tank.  
20110126010617.000|20110126010619.000|TR0|Finally, it really hits the skids with a 
20110126010619.000|20110126010621.000|TR0|42 percent rating.  That of course is in 
20110126010621.000|20110126010623.000|TR0|September, September 23, 2010.
20110126010623.000|20110126010625.000|TR0|
20110126010625.000|20110126010627.000|TR0|That's a period when this president of the 
20110126010627.000|20110126010630.000|TR0|United States is facing a lot of problems 
20110126010630.000|20110126010632.000|TR0|from Republicans criticizing him going up 
20110126010632.000|20110126010634.000|TR0|to the midterms.  A lot more problems from 
20110126010634.000|20110126010636.000|TR0|liberals who say he is not doing enough.
20110126010636.000|20110126010638.000|TR0|
20110126010638.000|20110126010640.000|TR0|Today 55 percent, pretty good for this 
20110126010640.000|20110126010642.000|TR0|president.  Let's see just how he compares 
20110126010642.000|20110126010644.000|TR0|with some other presidents.  In fact, all 
20110126010644.000|20110126010646.000|TR0|the presidents over the last 30 years, he 
20110126010646.000|20110126010648.000|TR0|is doing pretty well.
20110126010648.000|20110126010650.000|TR0|
20110126010650.000|20110126010653.000|TR0|The one thing most interesting about this 
20110126010653.000|20110126010655.000|TR0|chart is that the most iconic figure in 
20110126010655.000|20110126010657.000|TR0|politics during this period is Ronald 
20110126010657.000|20110126010659.000|TR0|Reagan.  He had the worst numbers at this 
20110126010659.000|20110126010701.000|TR0|point in his administration.
20110126010701.000|20110126010703.000|TR0|
20110126010703.000|20110126010705.000|TR0|This president is ahead of all the other 
20110126010705.000|20110126010707.000|TR0|Democrats, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.  
20110126010707.000|20110126010709.000|TR0|The only people he's behind is the two 
20110126010709.000|20110126010711.000|TR0|Bushes, Bush 41, Bush 43.  Both had 
20110126010711.000|20110126010713.000|TR0|foreign conflicts, one before, one after.
20110126010713.000|20110126010716.000|TR0|
20110126010716.000|20110126010718.000|TR0|So that's how it goes, Wolf.  The big 
20110126010718.000|20110126010720.000|TR0|question in all of this is trending.  
20110126010720.000|20110126010722.000|TR0|Which way were these presidents going?  
20110126010722.000|20110126010724.000|TR0|Were they going up or were they going 
20110126010724.000|20110126010726.000|TR0|down, and whether Barack Obama can 
20110126010726.000|20110126010728.000|TR0|maintain the momentum he's got right now?
20110126010728.000|20110126010730.000|TR0|
20110126010730.000|20110126010732.000|TR0|BLITZER:  He certainly has some momentum 
20110126010732.000|20110126010734.000|TR0|right now, but that could change mighty -- 
20110126010734.000|20110126010736.000|TR0|mightily quickly, if you will.
20110126010736.000|20110126010739.000|TR0|
20110126010739.000|20110126010741.000|TR0|Joe Johns, don't go too far away.
20110126010741.000|20110126010743.000|TR0|
20110126010743.000|20110126010745.000|TR0|John King is up on Capitol Hill.  He's 
20110126010745.000|20110126010747.000|TR0|watching what's going on.
20110126010747.000|20110126010749.000|TR0|
20110126010749.000|20110126010751.000|TR0|John, the president -- every president 
20110126010751.000|20110126010753.000|TR0|usually gets a nice little bump in the 
20110126010753.000|20110126010755.000|TR0|ratings right after a big State of the 
20110126010755.000|20110126010757.000|TR0|Union address.  I assume the president 
20110126010757.000|20110126010800.000|TR0|will as well.
20110126010800.000|20110126010802.000|TR0|
20110126010802.000|20110126010804.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST, JOHN KING, USA:  They are 
20110126010804.000|20110126010806.000|TR0|counting on that at the Obama White House, 
20110126010806.000|20110126010808.000|TR0|Wolf.  And to Joe's point, 55 percent 
20110126010808.000|20110126010810.000|TR0|approval rating is a good place for a 
20110126010810.000|20110126010812.000|TR0|president to be.  Any time you're above 60 
20110126010812.000|20110126010814.000|TR0|as you start to head into the election 
20110126010814.000|20110126010816.000|TR0|cycle, the political guys, whether 
20110126010816.000|20110126010818.000|TR0|Democrats or Republicans, will tell you 
20110126010818.000|20110126010820.000|TR0|above 50 is the place to be.
20110126010820.000|20110126010823.000|TR0|
20110126010823.000|20110126010825.000|TR0|But the other key thing to watch, Wolf, is 
20110126010825.000|20110126010827.000|TR0|a simple question in presidential 
20110126010827.000|20110126010829.000|TR0|politics, a defining question in American 
20110126010829.000|20110126010831.000|TR0|politics.  When you ask the American 
20110126010831.000|20110126010833.000|TR0|people, is the country on the right track. 
20110126010833.000|20110126010835.000|TR0| And that number is still in the negative. 
20110126010835.000|20110126010837.000|TR0| However, it is beginning to move.
20110126010837.000|20110126010839.000|TR0|
20110126010839.000|20110126010841.000|TR0|The American people are slowly becoming 
20110126010841.000|20110126010843.000|TR0|more optimistic about the economy.  And if 
20110126010843.000|20110126010846.000|TR0|they get more optimistic about the 
20110126010846.000|20110126010848.000|TR0|economy, that is the president's leading 
20110126010848.000|20110126010850.000|TR0|indicator heading into reelection.  And 
20110126010850.000|20110126010852.000|TR0|that his leading charge tonight.
20110126010852.000|20110126010854.000|TR0|
20110126010854.000|20110126010856.000|TR0|To say yes, the Republicans now control 
20110126010856.000|20110126010858.000|TR0|the House of Representatives.  Yes, the 
20110126010858.000|20110126010900.000|TR0|Republicans have more power here in 
20110126010900.000|20110126010902.000|TR0|Washington.  And yes, I'm going to have to 
20110126010902.000|20110126010904.000|TR0|do business with them.  And so the 
20110126010904.000|20110126010906.000|TR0|politics of the moment and the necessities 
20110126010906.000|20110126010909.000|TR0|of the moment are going to require a focus 
20110126010909.000|20110126010911.000|TR0|on deficit reduction, some spending cuts.
20110126010911.000|20110126010913.000|TR0|
20110126010913.000|20110126010915.000|TR0|But he will passionately make a case, and 
20110126010915.000|20110126010917.000|TR0|this is the big butting of the heads if 
20110126010917.000|20110126010919.000|TR0|you will at the moment that he has to have 
20110126010919.000|20110126010921.000|TR0|some new spending to compete in the 
20110126010921.000|20110126010923.000|TR0|economy, to make the economy not only 
20110126010923.000|20110126010925.000|TR0|better next year, but better for the next 
20110126010925.000|20110126010927.000|TR0|generation.
20110126010927.000|20110126010929.000|TR0|
20110126010929.000|20110126010932.000|TR0|And that is a defining challenge for the 
20110126010932.000|20110126010934.000|TR0|president to try to win the confidence 
20110126010934.000|20110126010936.000|TR0|argument, to win the trust argument 
20110126010936.000|20110126010938.000|TR0|tonight which is a big reset night in 
20110126010938.000|20110126010940.000|TR0|American politics.  The president saying 
20110126010940.000|20110126010942.000|TR0|trust me, not them.
20110126010942.000|20110126010944.000|TR0|
20110126010944.000|20110126010946.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And John, you and I both know 
20110126010946.000|20110126010948.000|TR0|that the president is bracing for what 
20110126010948.000|20110126010950.000|TR0|some White House officials call howling 
20110126010950.000|20110126010953.000|TR0|from some of their liberal base in the 
20110126010953.000|20110126010955.000|TR0|Democratic Party as a result of some of 
20110126010955.000|20110126010957.000|TR0|the so-called budget cuts he is going to 
20110126010957.000|20110126010959.000|TR0|be putting forward.  Tell our viewers what 
20110126010959.000|20110126011001.000|TR0|we're talking about.
20110126011001.000|20110126011003.000|TR0|
20110126011003.000|20110126011005.000|TR0|KING:  Well, in many ways, politically, 
20110126011005.000|20110126011007.000|TR0|Wolf, they're hoping for howling from the 
20110126011007.000|20110126011009.000|TR0|left, to be honest.  They're the 
20110126011009.000|20110126011011.000|TR0|Democratic White House.  But they hope for 
20110126011011.000|20110126011013.000|TR0|howling from the left when the president 
20110126011013.000|20110126011016.000|TR0|actually -- he won't have many specifics 
20110126011016.000|20110126011018.000|TR0|tonight.  He will talk about a five-year 
20110126011018.000|20110126011020.000|TR0|spending freeze.
20110126011020.000|20110126011022.000|TR0|
20110126011022.000|20110126011024.000|TR0|The Republicans will say that's not 
20110126011024.000|20110126011026.000|TR0|enough.  But we will get the president's 
20110126011026.000|20110126011028.000|TR0|budget over the course of the month and 
20110126011028.000|20110126011030.000|TR0|they will consolidate some government, I'm 
20110126011030.000|20110126011032.000|TR0|told.  They will cut some popular 
20110126011032.000|20110126011034.000|TR0|programs, I am told.  And I know you know 
20110126011034.000|20110126011036.000|TR0|this is -- and then they expect liberals 
20110126011036.000|20110126011039.000|TR0|to say what are you doing, Mr. President?  
20110126011039.000|20110126011041.000|TR0|You're supposed to be on our side.
20110126011041.000|20110126011043.000|TR0|
20110126011043.000|20110126011045.000|TR0|Now they'll have to deal with that.  But 
20110126011045.000|20110126011047.000|TR0|they know the bigger pressure for cuts 
20110126011047.000|20110126011049.000|TR0|will come from the Republicans.  And 
20110126011049.000|20110126011051.000|TR0|that's part of the president's goal 
20110126011051.000|20110126011053.000|TR0|tonight, Wolf.  He will say I'm the 
20110126011053.000|20110126011055.000|TR0|reasonable guy in the middle.  The left 
20110126011055.000|20110126011057.000|TR0|doesn't like everything, nor does the 
20110126011057.000|20110126011059.000|TR0|right.
20110126011059.000|20110126011102.000|TR0|
20110126011102.000|20110126011104.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, John, stand by.
20110126011104.000|20110126011106.000|TR0|
20110126011106.000|20110126011108.000|TR0|Let's go to White House, our senior 
20110126011108.000|20110126011110.000|TR0|correspondent Ed Henry.  He is getting 
20110126011110.000|20110126011112.000|TR0|excerpts of what the president say.
20110126011112.000|20110126011114.000|TR0|
20110126011114.000|20110126011116.000|TR0|Ed, I know they have worked really hard, 
20110126011116.000|20110126011118.000|TR0|the president's speech writers, his top 
20110126011118.000|20110126011120.000|TR0|aides.  But the president of the United 
20110126011120.000|20110126011123.000|TR0|States, he has personally been involved in 
20110126011123.000|20110126011125.000|TR0|crafting what is probably going to be a 
20110126011125.000|20110126011127.000|TR0|nearly one-hour speech.
20110126011127.000|20110126011129.000|TR0|
20110126011129.000|20110126011131.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110126011131.000|20110126011133.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  He is, Wolf.  In fact, top 
20110126011133.000|20110126011135.000|TR0|aides say this is a president who kicks 
20110126011135.000|20110126011137.000|TR0|back a lot of drafts, puts his 
20110126011137.000|20110126011139.000|TR0|fingerprints all over these kinds of big 
20110126011139.000|20110126011141.000|TR0|speeches.
20110126011141.000|20110126011143.000|TR0|
20110126011143.000|20110126011146.000|TR0|And as you and John were talking about, 
20110126011146.000|20110126011148.000|TR0|one president he's going to be borrowing a 
20110126011148.000|20110126011150.000|TR0|little bit, at least from, is Bill 
20110126011150.000|20110126011152.000|TR0|Clinton.  If you look at this excerpt 
20110126011152.000|20110126011154.000|TR0|we've already gotten, the president refers 
20110126011154.000|20110126011156.000|TR0|to that shellacking in the election and 
20110126011156.000|20110126011158.000|TR0|says, quote, "With their votes, the 
20110126011158.000|20110126011200.000|TR0|American people determined that govern 
20110126011200.000|20110126011202.000|TR0|willing now be a shared responsibility 
20110126011202.000|20110126011204.000|TR0|between parties.  New laws will only pass 
20110126011204.000|20110126011206.000|TR0|with support from Democrats and 
20110126011206.000|20110126011209.000|TR0|Republicans.
20110126011209.000|20110126011211.000|TR0|
20110126011211.000|20110126011213.000|TR0|"We will move forward together or not at 
20110126011213.000|20110126011215.000|TR0|all for the challenges we face are bigger 
20110126011215.000|20110126011217.000|TR0|than party and bigger than politics."  
20110126011217.000|20110126011219.000|TR0|Trying to send the signal as Bill Clinton 
20110126011219.000|20110126011221.000|TR0|did in 1995.  He gets the message from the 
20110126011221.000|20110126011223.000|TR0|election, but also maybe a little bit of a 
20110126011223.000|20110126011225.000|TR0|challenge to the Republicans.  They share 
20110126011225.000|20110126011227.000|TR0|the responsibility to govern.
20110126011227.000|20110126011229.000|TR0|
20110126011229.000|20110126011232.000|TR0|Now one other quick note about another 
20110126011232.000|20110126011234.000|TR0|president he's been relying on is Ronald 
20110126011234.000|20110126011236.000|TR0|Reagan.  Now why is that?  Aides say that 
20110126011236.000|20110126011238.000|TR0|over the holidays, the president was 
20110126011238.000|20110126011240.000|TR0|reading a biography of Ronald Reagan by 
20110126011240.000|20110126011242.000|TR0|Lou Cannon, in part because of that 
20110126011242.000|20110126011244.000|TR0|optimism we saw in Ronald Reagan's State 
20110126011244.000|20110126011246.000|TR0|of the Union addresses and throughout his 
20110126011246.000|20110126011248.000|TR0|presidency.
20110126011248.000|20110126011250.000|TR0|
20110126011250.000|20110126011253.000|TR0|And we're going to hear a lot about that 
20110126011253.000|20110126011255.000|TR0|tonight when the president talks about 
20110126011255.000|20110126011257.000|TR0|competitiveness, about how he believes the 
20110126011257.000|20110126011259.000|TR0|United States is ready for what he's going 
20110126011259.000|20110126011301.000|TR0|to call tonight a Sputnik moment to rise 
20110126011301.000|20110126011303.000|TR0|to the occasion.
20110126011303.000|20110126011305.000|TR0|
20110126011305.000|20110126011307.000|TR0|Well, what's the other thing Bill Clinton 
20110126011307.000|20110126011309.000|TR0|and Ronald Reagan have in common?  Both of 
20110126011309.000|20110126011311.000|TR0|them faced a tough midterm elections, had 
20110126011311.000|20110126011313.000|TR0|huge challenges after the first two years, 
20110126011313.000|20110126011316.000|TR0|but they both made adjustments and they 
20110126011316.000|20110126011318.000|TR0|both got reelected, Wolf.
20110126011318.000|20110126011320.000|TR0|
20110126011320.000|20110126011322.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  Ed, stand by because 
20110126011322.000|20110126011324.000|TR0|this is going to be a fascinating night.  
20110126011324.000|20110126011326.000|TR0|There's a lot of strange developments 
20110126011326.000|20110126011328.000|TR0|happening in the U.S. Congress tonight.
20110126011328.000|20110126011330.000|TR0|
20110126011330.000|20110126011332.000|TR0|For the first time, at least I know of, 
20110126011332.000|20110126011334.000|TR0|there will be not -- the members will not 
20110126011334.000|20110126011336.000|TR0|sit Republicans on one side, Democrats on 
20110126011336.000|20110126011339.000|TR0|the other side.  They're going to be 
20110126011339.000|20110126011341.000|TR0|sitting together.  It's what they call 
20110126011341.000|20110126011343.000|TR0|date night on Capitol Hill.  Some very 
20110126011343.000|20110126011345.000|TR0|strange odd couples.
20110126011345.000|20110126011347.000|TR0|
20110126011347.000|20110126011349.000|TR0|They're getting ready to sit next to each 
20110126011349.000|20110126011351.000|TR0|other.  We're going to watch that.
20110126011351.000|20110126011353.000|TR0|
20110126011353.000|20110126011355.000|TR0|Also something else.  Not just one 
20110126011355.000|20110126011357.000|TR0|Republican response tonight from the 
20110126011357.000|20110126011359.000|TR0|official Republican responder, if you 
20110126011359.000|20110126011402.000|TR0|will, Republican Congressman Paul Ryan of 
20110126011402.000|20110126011404.000|TR0|Wisconsin, but a second one from a Tea 
20110126011404.000|20110126011406.000|TR0|Party supporter and activist, Michele 
20110126011406.000|20110126011408.000|TR0|Bachmann.  She'll be giving a separate Tea 
20110126011408.000|20110126011410.000|TR0|Party response to the president.
20110126011410.000|20110126011412.000|TR0|
20110126011412.000|20110126011414.000|TR0|Only CNN will carry all of this live.  Our 
20110126011414.000|20110126011416.000|TR0|coverage will continue right after this.

20110126011423.000|20110126011425.000|TR0|BLITZER:  The United States Capitol.  
20110126011425.000|20110126011427.000|TR0|Always a beautiful sight, especially on 
20110126011427.000|20110126011429.000|TR0|this night when all the members of the 
20110126011429.000|20110126011431.000|TR0|House of Representatives and the Senate, 
20110126011431.000|20110126011433.000|TR0|they're invited to attend the president's 
20110126011433.000|20110126011435.000|TR0|State of the Union address together with 
20110126011435.000|20110126011437.000|TR0|other distinguished guests as well.

20110126011439.000|20110126011441.000|TR0|This is Statuary Hall, live pictures 
20110126011441.000|20110126011443.000|TR0|you're seeing right there. Sort of like 
20110126011443.000|20110126011446.000|TR0|the red carpet version of what's going on 
20110126011446.000|20110126011448.000|TR0|on Capitol Hill.  The members will walk 
20110126011448.000|20110126011450.000|TR0|into the House floor through that area 
20110126011450.000|20110126011452.000|TR0|right there.  You see reporters standing 
20110126011452.000|20110126011454.000|TR0|by, camera crews.

20110126011502.000|20110126011504.000|TR0|Jessica, tell our viewers where you are, 
20110126011504.000|20110126011506.000|TR0|what you're seeing, and what's going on.

20110126011511.000|20110126011513.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, I'm at the very far 
20110126011513.000|20110126011515.000|TR0|end here near the doors where people will 
20110126011515.000|20110126011517.000|TR0|actually walk in and take their seats.  As 
20110126011517.000|20110126011519.000|TR0|they're walking by, a lot of them stop to 
20110126011519.000|20110126011521.000|TR0|tell us who they're sitting with.  It's 
20110126011521.000|20110126011523.000|TR0|been a big theme, the bipartisan seating 
20110126011523.000|20110126011525.000|TR0|as you know.
20110126011525.000|20110126011527.000|TR0|
20110126011527.000|20110126011529.000|TR0|But the other thing is I've been asking 
20110126011529.000|20110126011532.000|TR0|especially some of the Republican members 
20110126011532.000|20110126011534.000|TR0|about what the president plans to say 
20110126011534.000|20110126011536.000|TR0|tonight, spending obviously and reining in 
20110126011536.000|20110126011538.000|TR0|spending is a major theme for the new 
20110126011538.000|20110126011540.000|TR0|Republican class in the House.
20110126011540.000|20110126011542.000|TR0|
20110126011542.000|20110126011544.000|TR0|And the president plans to announce that 
20110126011544.000|20110126011546.000|TR0|he would like to freeze nondiscretionary 
20110126011546.000|20110126011548.000|TR0|spending, nondefense discretionary 
20110126011548.000|20110126011550.000|TR0|spending for five years at the next year's 
20110126011550.000|20110126011553.000|TR0|level.  So I have asked these Republican 
20110126011553.000|20110126011555.000|TR0|members, is that good enough for them?  
20110126011555.000|20110126011557.000|TR0|And to a person, those I have talked to 
20110126011557.000|20110126011559.000|TR0|say no, not nearly good enough.
20110126011559.000|20110126011601.000|TR0|
20110126011601.000|20110126011603.000|TR0|Freezing spending at its current high 
20110126011603.000|20110126011605.000|TR0|rates, in their view, their words, is not 
20110126011605.000|20110126011607.000|TR0|enough of a compromise.  So already a 
20110126011607.000|20110126011609.000|TR0|fight shaping up between the Republicans 
20110126011609.000|20110126011611.000|TR0|and the president.  But he is offering an 
20110126011611.000|20110126011613.000|TR0|olive branch, and in some ways that's 
20110126011613.000|20110126011616.000|TR0|really all he needs to do to knock off 
20110126011616.000|20110126011618.000|TR0|this year and this debate.  But it will be 
20110126011618.000|20110126011620.000|TR0|a feisty debate going forward -- Wolf.
20110126011620.000|20110126011622.000|TR0|
20110126011622.000|20110126011624.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And we're only about 15 minutes 
20110126011624.000|20110126011626.000|TR0|away from when we can actually go inside 
20110126011626.000|20110126011628.000|TR0|and see what's happening on the floor of 
20110126011628.000|20110126011630.000|TR0|the House.
20110126011630.000|20110126011632.000|TR0|
20110126011632.000|20110126011634.000|TR0|Jessica, don't go too far away.  If you 
20110126011634.000|20110126011636.000|TR0|see somebody really cool walking in or you 
20110126011636.000|20110126011639.000|TR0|see one of those odd couples walking in 
20110126011639.000|20110126011641.000|TR0|together holding hands, you'll grab them, 
20110126011641.000|20110126011643.000|TR0|you'll talk to them, you'll let us know.
20110126011643.000|20110126011645.000|TR0|
20110126011645.000|20110126011647.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Will do.
20110126011647.000|20110126011649.000|TR0|
20110126011649.000|20110126011651.000|TR0|BLITZER:  We'll put them on television as 
20110126011651.000|20110126011653.000|TR0|well.
20110126011653.000|20110126011655.000|TR0|
20110126011655.000|20110126011657.000|TR0|Jessica Yellin is outside of the floor of 
20110126011657.000|20110126011659.000|TR0|the House of Representatives at Statuary 
20110126011659.000|20110126011702.000|TR0|Hall.
20110126011702.000|20110126011704.000|TR0|
20110126011704.000|20110126011706.000|TR0|Ali Velshi is here with us together with 
20110126011706.000|20110126011708.000|TR0|members of the best political team on 
20110126011708.000|20110126011710.000|TR0|television.
20110126011710.000|20110126011712.000|TR0|
20110126011712.000|20110126011714.000|TR0|Ali, it's all about jobs tonight.
20110126011714.000|20110126011716.000|TR0|
20110126011716.000|20110126011718.000|TR0|ALI VELSHI, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS 
20110126011718.000|20110126011720.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely.  The economy 
20110126011720.000|20110126011722.000|TR0|is by far the biggest issue for three 
20110126011722.000|20110126011725.000|TR0|years on Americans' minds.  Unemployment 
20110126011725.000|20110126011727.000|TR0|is at the top of that.  Our national 
20110126011727.000|20110126011729.000|TR0|unemployment rate is 9.4 percent.  But the 
20110126011729.000|20110126011731.000|TR0|reality is even that number doesn't 
20110126011731.000|20110126011733.000|TR0|encompass most of the unemployed in this 
20110126011733.000|20110126011735.000|TR0|country.
20110126011735.000|20110126011737.000|TR0|
20110126011737.000|20110126011739.000|TR0|So I've taken the map of the country and 
20110126011739.000|20110126011741.000|TR0|I've divided it up. Those states that have 
20110126011741.000|20110126011743.000|TR0|an unemployment rate that is 1.5 
20110126011743.000|20110126011746.000|TR0|percentage points higher than the national 
20110126011746.000|20110126011748.000|TR0|average are the ones you see here in red.  
20110126011748.000|20110126011750.000|TR0|Those with a percentage point -- an 
20110126011750.000|20110126011752.000|TR0|unemployment rate 1.5 percentage points 
20110126011752.000|20110126011754.000|TR0|lower than the national average are the 
20110126011754.000|20110126011756.000|TR0|states in green.  Everything else is about 
20110126011756.000|20110126011758.000|TR0|the same as the national average.
20110126011758.000|20110126011800.000|TR0|
20110126011800.000|20110126011802.000|TR0|Take a look at Michigan right below me, or 
20110126011802.000|20110126011804.000|TR0|Rhode Island in the east.  These are 
20110126011804.000|20110126011806.000|TR0|states that have suffered from the 
20110126011806.000|20110126011809.000|TR0|long-term decline in manufacturing jobs in 
20110126011809.000|20110126011811.000|TR0|this country.
20110126011811.000|20110126011813.000|TR0|
20110126011813.000|20110126011815.000|TR0|Take a look at the other red dots.  You've 
20110126011815.000|20110126011817.000|TR0|got California, Nevada, and Florida.  What 
20110126011817.000|20110126011819.000|TR0|do they have in common?  They were all 
20110126011819.000|20110126011821.000|TR0|states where there was a great deal of 
20110126011821.000|20110126011823.000|TR0|property speculation, and there were a 
20110126011823.000|20110126011825.000|TR0|great deal of jobs involved in 
20110126011825.000|20110126011827.000|TR0|construction that have all been lost.
20110126011827.000|20110126011829.000|TR0|
20110126011829.000|20110126011832.000|TR0|Look at these states in the middle, the 
20110126011832.000|20110126011834.000|TR0|mountain states going all the way down 
20110126011834.000|20110126011836.000|TR0|almost to Texas.  These are states that 
20110126011836.000|20110126011838.000|TR0|are a little bit more diversified.  These 
20110126011838.000|20110126011840.000|TR0|are states that have education.  They've 
20110126011840.000|20110126011842.000|TR0|got nursing jobs, they've got other health 
20110126011842.000|20110126011844.000|TR0|care jobs.  They've got oil prospecting, 
20110126011844.000|20110126011846.000|TR0|transportation jobs, accounting jobs.
20110126011846.000|20110126011848.000|TR0|
20110126011848.000|20110126011850.000|TR0|The reality is that unemployment across 
20110126011850.000|20110126011852.000|TR0|this country is different depending on 
20110126011852.000|20110126011855.000|TR0|where you live.  If you are dependent upon 
20110126011855.000|20110126011857.000|TR0|manufacturing, old-fashioned American 
20110126011857.000|20110126011859.000|TR0|jobs, unfortunately, regardless of what 
20110126011859.000|20110126011901.000|TR0|everyone will tell you, it isn't -- those 
20110126011901.000|20110126011903.000|TR0|jobs are not coming back right now.
20110126011903.000|20110126011905.000|TR0|
20110126011905.000|20110126011907.000|TR0|We have faced too many challenges from 
20110126011907.000|20110126011909.000|TR0|China on that.  The reality is we have to 
20110126011909.000|20110126011911.000|TR0|find new jobs in alternative energy, in 
20110126011911.000|20110126011913.000|TR0|traditional energy, in education, and 
20110126011913.000|20110126011916.000|TR0|those are states that are succeeding.
20110126011916.000|20110126011918.000|TR0|
20110126011918.000|20110126011920.000|TR0|We'll have to see what the president says 
20110126011920.000|20110126011922.000|TR0|about that.  No doubt he will touch on 
20110126011922.000|20110126011924.000|TR0|those topics.
20110126011924.000|20110126011926.000|TR0|
20110126011926.000|20110126011928.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right, Ali, stand by.
20110126011928.000|20110126011930.000|TR0|
20110126011930.000|20110126011932.000|TR0|VELSHI:  Yes.
20110126011932.000|20110126011934.000|TR0|
20110126011934.000|20110126011936.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Because we have more information 
20110126011936.000|20110126011939.000|TR0|that you're going the share with our 
20110126011939.000|20110126011941.000|TR0|viewers as well.
20110126011941.000|20110126011943.000|TR0|
20110126011943.000|20110126011945.000|TR0|Eliot, I know you're going to go pretty 
20110126011945.000|20110126011947.000|TR0|soon, but quickly, the only way really to 
20110126011947.000|20110126011949.000|TR0|create millions of jobs is to get the 
20110126011949.000|20110126011951.000|TR0|economy roaring once again.  The president 
20110126011951.000|20110126011953.000|TR0|is going to come up with some ideas.  But 
20110126011953.000|20110126011955.000|TR0|how does he do that?
20110126011955.000|20110126011957.000|TR0|
20110126011957.000|20110126011959.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, look, I think that's the 
20110126011959.000|20110126012002.000|TR0|problem.  He has said to his own staff how 
20110126012002.000|20110126012004.000|TR0|do we get this economy booming.  Fiscal 
20110126012004.000|20110126012006.000|TR0|policy is out because Congress really 
20110126012006.000|20110126012008.000|TR0|won't spend more money.  Monetary policy 
20110126012008.000|20110126012010.000|TR0|is out because interest rates are at zero.
20110126012010.000|20110126012012.000|TR0|
20110126012012.000|20110126012014.000|TR0|The only answer is innovation.  That's why 
20110126012014.000|20110126012016.000|TR0|if you read the text to the speech that is 
20110126012016.000|20110126012018.000|TR0|now being distributed, on page three, at 
20110126012018.000|20110126012020.000|TR0|least the version we have, innovation 
20110126012020.000|20110126012022.000|TR0|crops up.  Creativity, innovation, 
20110126012022.000|20110126012025.000|TR0|technology.  That is what the president 
20110126012025.000|20110126012027.000|TR0|wants to tell the American people.
20110126012027.000|20110126012029.000|TR0|
20110126012029.000|20110126012031.000|TR0|We must transition to a new foundation for 
20110126012031.000|20110126012033.000|TR0|our economy.  That will be a slow process, 
20110126012033.000|20110126012035.000|TR0|but he wants to help make that happen by 
20110126012035.000|20110126012037.000|TR0|investing -- that will be the word he uses 
20110126012037.000|20110126012039.000|TR0|-- in technology and education and R  and 
20110126012039.000|20110126012041.000|TR0|infrastructure.  That is the way he will 
20110126012041.000|20110126012043.000|TR0|say this economy will become one that will 
20110126012043.000|20110126012046.000|TR0|grow creating millions of jobs down the 
20110126012046.000|20110126012048.000|TR0|road.
20110126012048.000|20110126012050.000|TR0|
20110126012050.000|20110126012052.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And Eric Erickson, you know that 
20110126012052.000|20110126012054.000|TR0|when Republicans hear the word investing, 
20110126012054.000|20110126012056.000|TR0|they think big government spending.
20110126012056.000|20110126012058.000|TR0|
20110126012058.000|20110126012100.000|TR0|ERICK ERICKSON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  Very 
20110126012100.000|20110126012102.000|TR0|much.  It is the exact same rhetoric he 
20110126012102.000|20110126012104.000|TR0|used in the stimulus plan that the 
20110126012104.000|20110126012106.000|TR0|Republicans didn't very much like, which 
20110126012106.000|20110126012109.000|TR0|still those funds haven't entirely been 
20110126012109.000|20110126012111.000|TR0|spent. And some of this reflects the words 
20110126012111.000|20110126012113.000|TR0|in the stimulus.
20110126012113.000|20110126012115.000|TR0|
20110126012115.000|20110126012117.000|TR0|The 5 percent freeze or the 5 percent 
20110126012117.000|20110126012119.000|TR0|spending freeze, it was, I guess, a 3 
20110126012119.000|20110126012121.000|TR0|percent spending freeze he called for in 
20110126012121.000|20110126012123.000|TR0|last year's State of the Union address.  A 
20110126012123.000|20110126012125.000|TR0|lot of these things in the size.  And he's 
20110126012125.000|20110126012127.000|TR0|not touching, neither are the Republicans 
20110126012127.000|20110126012129.000|TR0|for that matter -- touching defense 
20110126012129.000|20110126012132.000|TR0|spending.  All of them should be touching 
20110126012132.000|20110126012134.000|TR0|defense spending and cutting that budget 
20110126012134.000|20110126012136.000|TR0|as well.

20110126012138.000|20110126012140.000|TR0|ROLAND MARTIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  Maybe 
20110126012140.000|20110126012142.000|TR0|what he should do is call it research and 
20110126012142.000|20110126012144.000|TR0|development because then we all love how 
20110126012144.000|20110126012146.000|TR0|corporate America loves their R  dollars.  
20110126012146.000|20110126012148.000|TR0|And they will -- maybe if you call it 
20110126012148.000|20110126012150.000|TR0|that, the Republicans might actually buy 
20110126012150.000|20110126012152.000|TR0|into it.
20110126012152.000|20110126012155.000|TR0|
20110126012155.000|20110126012157.000|TR0|Look, we can sit here and ask the 
20110126012157.000|20110126012159.000|TR0|question, what is the government going to 
20110126012159.000|20110126012201.000|TR0|do?  But you've heard Republicans say for 
20110126012201.000|20110126012203.000|TR0|two years government can't grow jobs.  And 
20110126012203.000|20110126012205.000|TR0|so it's interesting that we keep asking of 
20110126012205.000|20110126012207.000|TR0|a president what are you going to do to 
20110126012207.000|20110126012209.000|TR0|grow jobs when the opposition says 
20110126012209.000|20110126012211.000|TR0|government can't grow jobs.       Then I 
20110126012211.000|20110126012213.000|TR0|hear Republicans then say we have to grow 
20110126012213.000|20110126012216.000|TR0|jobs.  So I'm saying OK, guys, which one 
20110126012216.000|20110126012218.000|TR0|is it?  Because if you can't do it and 
20110126012218.000|20110126012220.000|TR0|private sector can do it, then what are 
20110126012220.000|20110126012222.000|TR0|you actually saying?
20110126012222.000|20110126012224.000|TR0|
20110126012224.000|20110126012226.000|TR0|ERICKSON:  Keep government out of the way.
20110126012226.000|20110126012228.000|TR0|
20110126012228.000|20110126012230.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Yes, but I want to disagree with 
20110126012230.000|20110126012232.000|TR0|the notion that Republicans can't embrace 
20110126012232.000|20110126012234.000|TR0|his competitiveness agenda.  Five years 
20110126012234.000|20110126012236.000|TR0|ago there was a big -- the National 
20110126012236.000|20110126012239.000|TR0|Economies of Science and Engineering came 
20110126012239.000|20110126012241.000|TR0|up with a great big report, proposed a 
20110126012241.000|20110126012243.000|TR0|competitiveness agenda for the United 
20110126012243.000|20110126012245.000|TR0|States.
20110126012245.000|20110126012247.000|TR0|
20110126012247.000|20110126012249.000|TR0|George W. Bush embraced it and proposed it 
20110126012249.000|20110126012251.000|TR0|and a Republican Congress voted for it 
20110126012251.000|20110126012253.000|TR0|overwhelmingly.  It is not true that 
20110126012253.000|20110126012255.000|TR0|Republicans will not support this.
20110126012255.000|20110126012257.000|TR0|
20110126012257.000|20110126012259.000|TR0|MARTIN:  Well, keep in mind the same 
20110126012259.000|20110126012302.000|TR0|Republicans opposed the -- budget council 
20110126012302.000|20110126012304.000|TR0|in terms of folks who actually -- the 
20110126012304.000|20110126012306.000|TR0|deficit commission, I'm sorry.  They 
20110126012306.000|20110126012308.000|TR0|opposed that even though it was one of 
20110126012308.000|20110126012310.000|TR0|their ideas.  And actually the health care 
20110126012310.000|20110126012312.000|TR0|bill, we actually came up with, you hear 
20110126012312.000|20110126012314.000|TR0|Republicans say, even Bill Frist said it 
20110126012314.000|20110126012316.000|TR0|was originally a Republican idea.  So they 
20110126012316.000|20110126012318.000|TR0|have a history of actually opposing things 
20110126012318.000|20110126012320.000|TR0|they liked before.
20110126012320.000|20110126012322.000|TR0|
20110126012322.000|20110126012325.000|TR0|SPITZER:  I would just totally agree with 
20110126012325.000|20110126012327.000|TR0|David.  I was going to quote from George 
20110126012327.000|20110126012329.000|TR0|W. Bush's speech to the nation which he 
20110126012329.000|20110126012331.000|TR0|relied upon the same language of 
20110126012331.000|20110126012333.000|TR0|competitiveness, , innovation and 
20110126012333.000|20110126012335.000|TR0|investment in R , just as President Obama 
20110126012335.000|20110126012337.000|TR0|will today.  This is a bipartisan 
20110126012337.000|20110126012339.000|TR0|understanding about how you must 
20110126012339.000|20110126012341.000|TR0|transition our economy.
20110126012341.000|20110126012343.000|TR0|
20110126012343.000|20110126012346.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And he'll talk --
20110126012346.000|20110126012348.000|TR0|
20110126012348.000|20110126012350.000|TR0|SPITZER:  There is no disagreement about 
20110126012350.000|20110126012352.000|TR0|this.
20110126012352.000|20110126012354.000|TR0|
20110126012354.000|20110126012356.000|TR0|BLITZER:  He'll talk tonight about a new 
20110126012356.000|20110126012358.000|TR0|age of Sputnik for those of us old enough 
20110126012358.000|20110126012400.000|TR0|to remember what that word means.
20110126012400.000|20110126012402.000|TR0|
20110126012402.000|20110126012404.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Absolutely.
20110126012404.000|20110126012406.000|TR0|
20110126012406.000|20110126012409.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.

20110126012411.000|20110126012413.000|TR0|MARTIN:  What is that?

20110126012423.000|20110126012425.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Hold on.  Roland, we're going to 
20110126012425.000|20110126012427.000|TR0|teach you -- we're going to teach you all 
20110126012427.000|20110126012429.000|TR0|about that.

20110126012438.000|20110126012440.000|TR0|there it is. The family will be getting 
20110126012440.000|20110126012442.000|TR0|ready to leave the White House.  I believe

20110126012444.000|20110126012446.000|TR0|House.  There will be the motorcade

20110126012614.000|20110126012616.000|TR0|that begins tonight.  We won't settle any 
20110126012616.000|20110126012618.000|TR0|of these big debates tonight.  But you 
20110126012618.000|20110126012620.000|TR0|heard David Gergen, Eliot Spitzer, and 
20110126012620.000|20110126012622.000|TR0|others from the last segment arguing about 
20110126012622.000|20110126012625.000|TR0|can the president -- the Democratic

20110126012627.000|20110126012629.000|TR0|new investments he will call them.  They 
20110126012629.000|20110126012631.000|TR0|will say no, sir, it's more liberal 
20110126012631.000|20110126012633.000|TR0|spending.

20110126012637.000|20110126012639.000|TR0|ANALYST:  Right.
20110126012639.000|20110126012641.000|TR0|
20110126012641.000|20110126012643.000|TR0|KING:  But about the economy, on a 
20110126012643.000|20110126012645.000|TR0|competitiveness agenda, can he sell the 
20110126012645.000|20110126012648.000|TR0|Republicans at a time many Republicans 
20110126012648.000|20110126012650.000|TR0|would probably say maybe, but with the Tea 
20110126012650.000|20110126012652.000|TR0|Party forces they say no?
20110126012652.000|20110126012654.000|TR0|
20110126012654.000|20110126012656.000|TR0|BORGER:  No.  You know, it's interesting 
20110126012656.000|20110126012658.000|TR0|you should ask this.  I was talking to a 
20110126012658.000|20110126012700.000|TR0|senior White House adviser today and I 
20110126012700.000|20110126012702.000|TR0|said just that.  The Republicans are going 
20110126012702.000|20110126012704.000|TR0|to say you're spending too much money.  We 
20110126012704.000|20110126012706.000|TR0|need to cut money.  And his answer was, 
20110126012706.000|20110126012709.000|TR0|let the American people decide whether 
20110126012709.000|20110126012711.000|TR0|expanding the educational system is 
20110126012711.000|20110126012713.000|TR0|wasteful.
20110126012713.000|20110126012715.000|TR0|
20110126012715.000|20110126012717.000|TR0|Let them decide whether they're doing that 
20110126012717.000|20110126012719.000|TR0|for their children's future is wasteful, 
20110126012719.000|20110126012721.000|TR0|or whether we ought to do it now.  So it's 
20110126012721.000|20110126012723.000|TR0|an argument it's clear that the president 
20110126012723.000|20110126012725.000|TR0|is really willing to have within a 
20110126012725.000|20110126012727.000|TR0|framework of fiscal responsibility.
20110126012727.000|20110126012729.000|TR0|
20110126012729.000|20110126012732.000|TR0|KING:  And the president is convinced, I 
20110126012732.000|20110126012734.000|TR0|am told, that if he can sell the American 
20110126012734.000|20110126012736.000|TR0|people that he is serious about some cuts.
20110126012736.000|20110126012738.000|TR0|
20110126012738.000|20110126012740.000|TR0|BORGER:  Yes.
20110126012740.000|20110126012742.000|TR0|
20110126012742.000|20110126012744.000|TR0|KING:  That he comes across as credible 
20110126012744.000|20110126012746.000|TR0|when it comes to cutting spending and 
20110126012746.000|20110126012748.000|TR0|deficit reduction, he believes he can make 
20110126012748.000|20110126012750.000|TR0|a play to national pride.  Saying if we 
20110126012750.000|20110126012752.000|TR0|don't make these investments, we will fall 
20110126012752.000|20110126012755.000|TR0|behind China, behind India, behind other 
20110126012755.000|20110126012757.000|TR0|in the global economy.
20110126012757.000|20110126012759.000|TR0|
20110126012759.000|20110126012801.000|TR0|The question is, can he make that case to 
20110126012801.000|20110126012803.000|TR0|the American people and then get about the 
20110126012803.000|20110126012805.000|TR0|nitty-gritty what we haven't seen only in 
20110126012805.000|20110126012807.000|TR0|the lame duck session in the tax cut deal.
20110126012807.000|20110126012809.000|TR0|
20110126012809.000|20110126012811.000|TR0|BORGER:  Right.
20110126012811.000|20110126012813.000|TR0|
20110126012813.000|20110126012815.000|TR0|KING:  Can this president negotiate, not 
20110126012815.000|20110126012818.000|TR0|just position himself with the American 
20110126012818.000|20110126012820.000|TR0|people, but negotiate with this new 
20110126012820.000|20110126012822.000|TR0|Republican?
20110126012822.000|20110126012824.000|TR0|
20110126012824.000|20110126012826.000|TR0|BORGER:  Well, and here's another 
20110126012826.000|20110126012828.000|TR0|question.  Can he -- can he make the 
20110126012828.000|20110126012830.000|TR0|connection for the American people between 
20110126012830.000|20110126012832.000|TR0|all of this and their jobs and the fact 
20110126012832.000|20110126012834.000|TR0|that unemployment remains above 9 percent.
20110126012834.000|20110126012836.000|TR0|
20110126012836.000|20110126012839.000|TR0|You know, he's got to soar in this speech. 
20110126012839.000|20110126012841.000|TR0| It's the State of the Union.  He's got to 
20110126012841.000|20110126012843.000|TR0|appeal to the good in all of us and say 
20110126012843.000|20110126012845.000|TR0|yes, we're all about the future.  But on 
20110126012845.000|20110126012847.000|TR0|the other hand there are a lot of people 
20110126012847.000|20110126012849.000|TR0|sitting out there out of work.  And they 
20110126012849.000|20110126012851.000|TR0|have to believe after hearing this speech 
20110126012851.000|20110126012853.000|TR0|that the president is talking about a way 
20110126012853.000|20110126012855.000|TR0|to get them out of the mess they feel that 
20110126012855.000|20110126012857.000|TR0|they're in.
20110126012857.000|20110126012859.000|TR0|
20110126012859.000|20110126012902.000|TR0|KING:  And as we go back to Wolf and the 
20110126012902.000|20110126012904.000|TR0|rest of our colleagues in New York, Wolf, 
20110126012904.000|20110126012906.000|TR0|that is the big challenge for the 
20110126012906.000|20110126012908.000|TR0|president.  He wants to be uplifting.  He 
20110126012908.000|20110126012910.000|TR0|wants to be more confident.  But he also 
20110126012910.000|20110126012912.000|TR0|knows in a country with more than 9 
20110126012912.000|20110126012914.000|TR0|percent unemployment, he cannot promise a 
20110126012914.000|20110126012916.000|TR0|job to anyone out there who is unemployed.
20110126012916.000|20110126012918.000|TR0|
20110126012918.000|20110126012920.000|TR0|So he is trying to begin a game of very 
20110126012920.000|20110126012922.000|TR0|important chess if you will with the 
20110126012922.000|20110126012925.000|TR0|Republicans that he can be upbeat, but he 
20110126012925.000|20110126012927.000|TR0|needs to be careful because of the fragile 
20110126012927.000|20110126012929.000|TR0|state of the economy.
20110126012929.000|20110126012931.000|TR0|
20110126012931.000|20110126012933.000|TR0|BORGER:  Right.
20110126012933.000|20110126012935.000|TR0|
20110126012935.000|20110126012937.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And there will be plenty of 
20110126012937.000|20110126012939.000|TR0|battles in the weeks and months to come.
20110126012939.000|20110126012941.000|TR0|
20110126012941.000|20110126012943.000|TR0|Guys, stand by.
20110126012943.000|20110126012945.000|TR0|
20110126012945.000|20110126012948.000|TR0|I want to bring in CNN's newest, newest 
20110126012948.000|20110126012950.000|TR0|host, Piers Morgan who is watching all of 
20110126012950.000|20110126012952.000|TR0|this.
20110126012952.000|20110126012954.000|TR0|
20110126012954.000|20110126012956.000|TR0|How unusual is this State of the Union 
20110126012956.000|20110126012958.000|TR0|address?  You've got a perspective as 
20110126012958.000|20110126013000.000|TR0|someone who has come from overseas.  Give 
20110126013000.000|20110126013002.000|TR0|us a little unique --
20110126013002.000|20110126013004.000|TR0|
20110126013004.000|20110126013006.000|TR0|PIERS MORGAN, HOST, PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT:  
20110126013006.000|20110126013009.000|TR0|I think it's quite at the right time 
20110126013009.000|20110126013011.000|TR0|because in Britain of course we have the 
20110126013011.000|20110126013013.000|TR0|Queen's speech.  We don't have a State of 
20110126013013.000|20110126013015.000|TR0|the Union.  And with the "The King's 
20110126013015.000|20110126013017.000|TR0|Speech" getting so many Oscar nominations 
20110126013017.000|20110126013019.000|TR0|today it's focused back on what we have in 
20110126013019.000|20110126013021.000|TR0|Britain.
20110126013021.000|20110126013023.000|TR0|
20110126013023.000|20110126013025.000|TR0|In a funny way, reading the Obama speech 
20110126013025.000|20110126013027.000|TR0|just now, it reminds me of the primary 
20110126013027.000|20110126013029.000|TR0|purpose of the queen's speech or a king's 
20110126013029.000|20110126013032.000|TR0|speech.  And that is to restore confidence 
20110126013032.000|20110126013034.000|TR0|in your country.       Whatever has gone 
20110126013034.000|20110126013036.000|TR0|on in the year before, and it's been to 
20110126013036.000|20110126013038.000|TR0|him personally and for the country, one 
20110126013038.000|20110126013040.000|TR0|hell of a shellacking.  This is the time 
20110126013040.000|20110126013042.000|TR0|that President Obama has to say enough is 
20110126013042.000|20110126013044.000|TR0|enough.  We have to put this negativity 
20110126013044.000|20110126013046.000|TR0|behind us, and we have to start beating 
20110126013046.000|20110126013048.000|TR0|our chests to be the America that we were.
20110126013048.000|20110126013050.000|TR0|
20110126013050.000|20110126013052.000|TR0|Because I haven't seen America be this 
20110126013052.000|20110126013055.000|TR0|vulnerable in my lifetime. And he is quite 
20110126013055.000|20110126013057.000|TR0|right to accentuate I think the threat, 
20110126013057.000|20110126013059.000|TR0|but also the opportunity that is coming 
20110126013059.000|20110126013101.000|TR0|from China and India and other countries.
20110126013101.000|20110126013103.000|TR0|
20110126013103.000|20110126013105.000|TR0|America's got to do business with these 
20110126013105.000|20110126013107.000|TR0|countries.  America has to create jobs in 
20110126013107.000|20110126013109.000|TR0|this country to export to those countries. 
20110126013109.000|20110126013111.000|TR0| And reinvent the wheel of its business 
20110126013111.000|20110126013113.000|TR0|economy.  And I think he is right. I think 
20110126013113.000|20110126013115.000|TR0|it's a good speech.  It's an inspirational 
20110126013115.000|20110126013118.000|TR0|speech.  I think the Sputnik analogy is a 
20110126013118.000|20110126013120.000|TR0|good one.  Because when that happened, 
20110126013120.000|20110126013122.000|TR0|America was left behind.
20110126013122.000|20110126013124.000|TR0|
20110126013124.000|20110126013126.000|TR0|And there is a real danger at the moment 
20110126013126.000|20110126013128.000|TR0|of it being left behind by China.  And the 
20110126013128.000|20110126013130.000|TR0|answer is to get into China.  I mean look 
20110126013130.000|20110126013132.000|TR0|at General Motors.  They are shifting a 
20110126013132.000|20110126013134.000|TR0|lot of cars in China.  Other American 
20110126013134.000|20110126013136.000|TR0|businesses have got to start creating and 
20110126013136.000|20110126013139.000|TR0|exporting to these countries and making 
20110126013139.000|20110126013141.000|TR0|them business partners.
20110126013141.000|20110126013143.000|TR0|
20110126013143.000|20110126013145.000|TR0|BLITZER:  General Motors is selling more 
20110126013145.000|20110126013147.000|TR0|cars in China now than General Motors is 
20110126013147.000|20110126013149.000|TR0|selling in the United States.  And pretty 
20110126013149.000|20110126013151.000|TR0|soon, General Motors might be the number 
20110126013151.000|20110126013153.000|TR0|one car seller in the entire world. And it 
20110126013153.000|20110126013155.000|TR0|wasn't that long ago, David Gergen, when 
20110126013155.000|20110126013157.000|TR0|General Motors was, if not bankrupt, it 
20110126013157.000|20110126013159.000|TR0|was on the verge of bankruptcy.
20110126013159.000|20110126013202.000|TR0|
20110126013202.000|20110126013204.000|TR0|GERGEN:  We've gone from nearly 500,000 
20110126013204.000|20110126013206.000|TR0|jobs in Michigan and the car industry to 
20110126013206.000|20110126013208.000|TR0|about 100,000 jobs in the car industry.  
20110126013208.000|20110126013210.000|TR0|That's the decline.  That's what's really 
20110126013210.000|20110126013212.000|TR0|-- and I think as much as Americans are, 
20110126013212.000|20110126013214.000|TR0|is he up or is he down, I think they 
20110126013214.000|20110126013216.000|TR0|really care about this competition with 
20110126013216.000|20110126013218.000|TR0|China and these jobs disappearing.  They 
20110126013218.000|20110126013220.000|TR0|understand it.  And I think the president 
20110126013220.000|20110126013222.000|TR0|may change the conversation that we have 
20110126013222.000|20110126013225.000|TR0|not yet had a major conversation in this 
20110126013225.000|20110126013227.000|TR0|country about how to deal with this, and 
20110126013227.000|20110126013229.000|TR0|how to rebuild the jobs from the inside.
20110126013229.000|20110126013231.000|TR0|
20110126013231.000|20110126013233.000|TR0|BLITZER:  You know, Erick, I got to get 
20110126013233.000|20110126013235.000|TR0|your thoughts on two Republican responses 
20110126013235.000|20110126013237.000|TR0|tonight, not one, but two.  One from the 
20110126013237.000|20110126013239.000|TR0|traditional, I guess the establishment 
20110126013239.000|20110126013241.000|TR0|Republican, even though he is a very 
20110126013241.000|20110126013243.000|TR0|popular conservative, Paul Ryan, the 
20110126013243.000|20110126013245.000|TR0|congressman from Wisconsin. But Michele 
20110126013245.000|20110126013248.000|TR0|Bachmann of Minnesota, she is going to 
20110126013248.000|20110126013250.000|TR0|give a second Republican or Tea Party 
20110126013250.000|20110126013252.000|TR0|response as well.  We'll carry both of 
20110126013252.000|20110126013254.000|TR0|those live here on CNN.  I believe we're 
20110126013254.000|20110126013256.000|TR0|the only television network that will take 
20110126013256.000|20110126013258.000|TR0|it all live.  But how much of a problem is 
20110126013258.000|20110126013300.000|TR0|this for the GOP?
20110126013300.000|20110126013302.000|TR0|
20110126013302.000|20110126013304.000|TR0|ERICKSON:  I think it could be a problem 
20110126013304.000|20110126013306.000|TR0|for the GOP.  And the way it's already 
20110126013306.000|20110126013309.000|TR0|being portrayed is that it's a problem for 
20110126013309.000|20110126013311.000|TR0|the GOP. There's a split there.
20110126013311.000|20110126013313.000|TR0|
20110126013313.000|20110126013315.000|TR0|The fact is that the Tea Party movement is 
20110126013315.000|20110126013317.000|TR0|not part of the Republican movement and 
20110126013317.000|20110126013319.000|TR0|hasn't been.  And, of course, it's going 
20110126013319.000|20110126013321.000|TR0|to want to say it feels victorious after 
20110126013321.000|20110126013323.000|TR0|November.  The biggest issue I think that 
20110126013323.000|20110126013325.000|TR0|most people are missing is that, in 
20110126013325.000|20110126013327.000|TR0|effect, this is although completely 
20110126013327.000|20110126013329.000|TR0|different issues, this is analogous to the 
20110126013329.000|20110126013332.000|TR0|1980s rise of the Christian coalition 
20110126013332.000|20110126013334.000|TR0|where you have grassroots Christian 
20110126013334.000|20110126013336.000|TR0|activists mobilizing to a force.  We're 
20110126013336.000|20110126013338.000|TR0|now seeing this with the Tea Party 
20110126013338.000|20110126013340.000|TR0|movement taking on professional activists 
20110126013340.000|20110126013342.000|TR0|merging the grassroots and now they're 
20110126013342.000|20110126013344.000|TR0|becoming a force and an actual institution 
20110126013344.000|20110126013346.000|TR0|as opposed to this nebulous movement in 
20110126013346.000|20110126013348.000|TR0|the country.
20110126013348.000|20110126013350.000|TR0|
20110126013350.000|20110126013352.000|TR0|MARTIN:  The Tea Party may not be an elbow 
20110126013352.000|20110126013355.000|TR0|on the Republican Party, but they clearly 
20110126013355.000|20110126013357.000|TR0|are aligned with the Republican Party.  
20110126013357.000|20110126013359.000|TR0|It's not likely the Tea Party having 
20110126013359.000|20110126013401.000|TR0|significant conversations on the 
20110126013401.000|20110126013403.000|TR0|Democratic side.  And so I would have, 
20110126013403.000|20110126013405.000|TR0|frankly, more respect for the Tea Party if 
20110126013405.000|20110126013407.000|TR0|they did not have a member of Congress 
20110126013407.000|20110126013409.000|TR0|giving their response because to suggest 
20110126013409.000|20110126013411.000|TR0|that she's an activist, she's not.  She's 
20110126013411.000|20110126013413.000|TR0|a Republican member of Congress.  And so, 
20110126013413.000|20110126013415.000|TR0|you do have frankly, I guess, Republican 
20110126013415.000|20110126013418.000|TR0|light, Republican serious in terms of 
20110126013418.000|20110126013420.000|TR0|these addresses.  And so, frankly, it 
20110126013420.000|20110126013422.000|TR0|makes no sense to me.  It's different if 
20110126013422.000|20110126013424.000|TR0|you say it's a grassroots movement if you 
20110126013424.000|20110126013426.000|TR0|have the grassroots speaking tonight and 
20110126013426.000|20110126013428.000|TR0|not Congresswoman Michele Bachmann.
20110126013428.000|20110126013430.000|TR0|
20110126013430.000|20110126013432.000|TR0|ERICKSON:  That is the one curious choice 
20110126013432.000|20110126013434.000|TR0|is that Congresswoman Bachmann doing this 
20110126013434.000|20110126013436.000|TR0|who may wind up running for president, 
20110126013436.000|20110126013438.000|TR0|although I suspect the networks and the 
20110126013438.000|20110126013441.000|TR0|news wouldn't be covering it as much if it 
20110126013441.000|20110126013443.000|TR0|was just a grassroots activist as opposed 
20110126013443.000|20110126013445.000|TR0|to a member of Congress.
20110126013445.000|20110126013447.000|TR0|
20110126013447.000|20110126013449.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Well, there's clearly a 
20110126013449.000|20110126013451.000|TR0|significant element of the population, 
20110126013451.000|20110126013453.000|TR0|Candy, and you covered this, that likes 
20110126013453.000|20110126013455.000|TR0|the Tea Party. And based on what I could 
20110126013455.000|20110126013457.000|TR0|tell them, almost everybody who supports 
20110126013457.000|20110126013459.000|TR0|the Tea Party at least in these most 
20110126013459.000|20110126013502.000|TR0|recent midterm elections wound up voting 
20110126013502.000|20110126013504.000|TR0|on behalf of the Republicans.
20110126013504.000|20110126013506.000|TR0|
20110126013506.000|20110126013508.000|TR0|CROWLEY: Yes, I mean, the fact of the 
20110126013508.000|20110126013510.000|TR0|matter is Michele Bachmann is a 
20110126013510.000|20110126013512.000|TR0|Republican.  There is no Tea Party in the 
20110126013512.000|20110126013514.000|TR0|sense of the Republican Party, the 
20110126013514.000|20110126013516.000|TR0|Democrat --
20110126013516.000|20110126013518.000|TR0|
20110126013518.000|20110126013520.000|TR0|BLITZER:  There could be one of these days.
20110126013520.000|20110126013522.000|TR0|
20110126013522.000|20110126013525.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  Yes.  But at the moment this is 
20110126013525.000|20110126013527.000|TR0|not a -- yes, right. It's just, you know, 
20110126013527.000|20110126013529.000|TR0|the problem here is that maybe if they 
20110126013529.000|20110126013531.000|TR0|picked a better name or whatever.  But 
20110126013531.000|20110126013533.000|TR0|there's not a party.  Michele Bachmann is 
20110126013533.000|20110126013535.000|TR0|a Republican.  The people who were elected 
20110126013535.000|20110126013537.000|TR0|by Tea Party activists had an "r" after 
20110126013537.000|20110126013539.000|TR0|their name.
20110126013539.000|20110126013541.000|TR0|
20110126013541.000|20110126013543.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right.
20110126013543.000|20110126013545.000|TR0|
20110126013545.000|20110126013548.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  And you're going to see them.  
20110126013548.000|20110126013550.000|TR0|Look, they have enough Republicans in the 
20110126013550.000|20110126013552.000|TR0|House to let some of them spin off and 
20110126013552.000|20110126013554.000|TR0|vote the way they would like to, even if 
20110126013554.000|20110126013556.000|TR0|it's not where the more traditional 
20110126013556.000|20110126013558.000|TR0|Republicans are going to vote.  But the 
20110126013558.000|20110126013600.000|TR0|fact of the matter is this is another 
20110126013600.000|20110126013602.000|TR0|Republican response.
20110126013602.000|20110126013604.000|TR0|
20110126013604.000|20110126013606.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And I just want to remind our 
20110126013606.000|20110126013608.000|TR0|viewers the only place they'll see on 
20110126013608.000|20110126013611.000|TR0|television that speech live, Michele 
20110126013611.000|20110126013613.000|TR0|Bachmann's Tea Party speech will be right 
20110126013613.000|20110126013615.000|TR0|here on CNN.
20110126013615.000|20110126013617.000|TR0|
20110126013617.000|20110126013619.000|TR0|I'll take a break.  But a quick question.

20110126013625.000|20110126013627.000|TR0|the most powerful movie I've seen in a 
20110126013627.000|20110126013629.000|TR0|long time.  And Colin Firth and Geoffrey 
20110126013629.000|20110126013632.000|TR0|Rush and the others in it, outstanding 
20110126013632.000|20110126013634.000|TR0|acting.  A great story.  You cannot beat a 
20110126013634.000|20110126013636.000|TR0|great story.  The king of England who had 
20110126013636.000|20110126013638.000|TR0|a stammer so bad he couldn't speak.  And 
20110126013638.000|20110126013640.000|TR0|he finally has to make a speech to restore 
20110126013640.000|20110126013642.000|TR0|the country's confidence when they go to 
20110126013642.000|20110126013644.000|TR0|war with the Nazis.  It's an amazing story.

20110126013755.000|20110126013757.000|TR0|the House chamber right now.  They're 
20110126013757.000|20110126013759.000|TR0|getting ready.  At the top of the hour, 
20110126013759.000|20110126013802.000|TR0|the president of the United States will be 
20110126013802.000|20110126013804.000|TR0|introduced with those famous words "Mr. 
20110126013804.000|20110126013806.000|TR0|Speaker, the president of the United 
20110126013806.000|20110126013808.000|TR0|States." But members are now coming in.  
20110126013808.000|20110126013810.000|TR0|And this is most unusual because 
20110126013810.000|20110126013812.000|TR0|Republicans and Democrats, they're going 
20110126013812.000|20110126013814.000|TR0|to be sitting next to each other in the 
20110126013814.000|20110126013816.000|TR0|aftermath of the Tucson shooting.  They 
20110126013816.000|20110126013818.000|TR0|decided this was a good idea. It was -- it 
20110126013818.000|20110126013820.000|TR0|breaks tradition.
20110126013820.000|20110126013822.000|TR0|
20110126013822.000|20110126013825.000|TR0|I want to show you a clip of what happened 
20110126013825.000|20110126013827.000|TR0|back in 2006 when President Bush was 
20110126013827.000|20110126013829.000|TR0|delivering his State of the Union address. 
20110126013829.000|20110126013831.000|TR0| Watch this, and you see what normally 
20110126013831.000|20110126013833.000|TR0|happens when he says something, a 
20110126013833.000|20110126013835.000|TR0|president says something.  The Democrats 
20110126013835.000|20110126013837.000|TR0|will respond one way, the Republicans 
20110126013837.000|20110126013839.000|TR0|respond another way.
20110126013839.000|20110126013841.000|TR0|
20110126013841.000|20110126013843.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110126013843.000|20110126013845.000|TR0|
20110126013845.000|20110126013848.000|TR0|All right.  So you saw the Republicans 
20110126013848.000|20110126013850.000|TR0|standing.  The standing ovation for 
20110126013850.000|20110126013852.000|TR0|President Bush at that time.  But then the 
20110126013852.000|20110126013854.000|TR0|Democrats were sitting.
20110126013854.000|20110126013856.000|TR0|
20110126013856.000|20110126013858.000|TR0|Tonight, it's going to be different.  And 
20110126013858.000|20110126013900.000|TR0|there are some extraordinary odd couples, 
20110126013900.000|20110126013902.000|TR0|political odd couples who have decided to 
20110126013902.000|20110126013904.000|TR0|get together.  For example, Chuck Schumer, 
20110126013904.000|20110126013906.000|TR0|the Democratic senator from New York with 
20110126013906.000|20110126013908.000|TR0|Tom Coburn, the Republican senator from 
20110126013908.000|20110126013911.000|TR0|Oklahoma. Anthony Weiner is a very liberal 
20110126013911.000|20110126013913.000|TR0|Democrat from New York.  Pete King, he's a 
20110126013913.000|20110126013915.000|TR0|very conservative Republican from New 
20110126013915.000|20110126013917.000|TR0|York.  Bob Casey and Pat Toomey, the two 
20110126013917.000|20110126013919.000|TR0|senators from Pennsylvania.  John Boehner 
20110126013919.000|20110126013921.000|TR0|is now convening the House and some 
20110126013921.000|20110126013923.000|TR0|preliminary activities.  Let's listen 
20110126013923.000|20110126013925.000|TR0|briefly.
20110126013925.000|20110126013927.000|TR0|
20110126013927.000|20110126013929.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The United States 
20110126013929.000|20110126013932.000|TR0|Senate.
20110126013932.000|20110126013934.000|TR0|
20110126013934.000|20110126013936.000|TR0|(APPLAUSE)
20110126013936.000|20110126013938.000|TR0|
20110126013938.000|20110126013940.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  So you heard the 
20110126013940.000|20110126013942.000|TR0|members of the Senate being introduced.  
20110126013942.000|20110126013944.000|TR0|They're walking in.  Joe Biden leading 
20110126013944.000|20110126013946.000|TR0|members of the Senate because his official 
20110126013946.000|20110126013948.000|TR0|role is president of the Senate.  In case 
20110126013948.000|20110126013950.000|TR0|of a tie, he breaks that tie.  If it's a 
20110126013950.000|20110126013952.000|TR0|50-50 vote, he gets to break the tie.  
20110126013952.000|20110126013955.000|TR0|That's the role of the vice president in 
20110126013955.000|20110126013957.000|TR0|the Senate. So he is number one.
20110126013957.000|20110126013959.000|TR0|
20110126013959.000|20110126014001.000|TR0|You see Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid, 
20110126014001.000|20110126014003.000|TR0|the Republican leader, the minority leader 
20110126014003.000|20110126014005.000|TR0|and the Democratic leader.  And they're 
20110126014005.000|20110126014007.000|TR0|followed in by other Democrats and 
20110126014007.000|20110126014009.000|TR0|Republicans.  Jon Kyl, Senator Pat Leahy, 
20110126014009.000|20110126014011.000|TR0|Senator Schumer followed by Senator 
20110126014011.000|20110126014013.000|TR0|Coburn.  They'll all be walking in.  This 
20110126014013.000|20110126014015.000|TR0|is part of the ceremony that goes on at 
20110126014015.000|20110126014018.000|TR0|these kinds of events.
20110126014018.000|20110126014020.000|TR0|
20110126014020.000|20110126014022.000|TR0|Dana Bash is our senior congressional 
20110126014022.000|20110126014024.000|TR0|correspondent.  She is actually inside the 
20110126014024.000|20110126014026.000|TR0|House chamber right now.  They're walking 
20110126014026.000|20110126014028.000|TR0|in, Dana.  Tell us what you're seeing.
20110126014028.000|20110126014030.000|TR0|
20110126014030.000|20110126014032.000|TR0|VOPICE OF DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR 
20110126014032.000|20110126014034.000|TR0|CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  You know, it 
20110126014034.000|20110126014036.000|TR0|is not only going to be a different 
20110126014036.000|20110126014038.000|TR0|visual, Wolf.  I can tell you, I've been 
20110126014038.000|20110126014041.000|TR0|here for many years inside this chamber.  
20110126014041.000|20110126014043.000|TR0|It is a different vibe already.  You felt 
20110126014043.000|20110126014045.000|TR0|it as soon as you walked in and saw 
20110126014045.000|20110126014047.000|TR0|members of Congress mingling.
20110126014047.000|20110126014049.000|TR0|
20110126014049.000|20110126014051.000|TR0|I am sitting closest to what is 
20110126014051.000|20110126014053.000|TR0|traditionally been the Republican side of 
20110126014053.000|20110126014055.000|TR0|the aisle.  And I'm looking at a sea of 
20110126014055.000|20110126014057.000|TR0|Democrats mingled in with Republicans.  
20110126014057.000|20110126014059.000|TR0|And there have been chatting back and 
20110126014059.000|20110126014102.000|TR0|forth.  The people who had, as you 
20110126014102.000|20110126014104.000|TR0|mentioned, decided to pair before coming 
20110126014104.000|20110126014106.000|TR0|here, and even those who hadn't decided to 
20110126014106.000|20110126014108.000|TR0|pair.
20110126014108.000|20110126014110.000|TR0|
20110126014110.000|20110126014112.000|TR0|I'll just tell you one thing I'm looking 
20110126014112.000|20110126014114.000|TR0|at that will probably interest our 
20110126014114.000|20110126014116.000|TR0|viewers.  They probably remember the now 
20110126014116.000|20110126014118.000|TR0|infamous incident the last time President 
20110126014118.000|20110126014120.000|TR0|Obama was here when Joe Wilson, the 
20110126014120.000|20110126014122.000|TR0|Republican screamed "you lie." Well, guess 
20110126014122.000|20110126014125.000|TR0|what?  I'm looking at him right now 
20110126014125.000|20110126014127.000|TR0|sitting next to two female Democrats from 
20110126014127.000|20110126014129.000|TR0|California on the Republican side.  So 
20110126014129.000|20110126014131.000|TR0|that just gives you a sense of how 
20110126014131.000|20110126014133.000|TR0|different the vibe is.  When this speech 
20110126014133.000|20110126014135.000|TR0|starts, it will obviously be very 
20110126014135.000|20110126014137.000|TR0|interesting to see.  As you mentioned 
20110126014137.000|20110126014139.000|TR0|before, historically we've seen one side 
20110126014139.000|20110126014141.000|TR0|get up and applaud, one side sit down.  
20110126014141.000|20110126014143.000|TR0|How things change when Democrats and 
20110126014143.000|20110126014145.000|TR0|Republicans are sitting side by side.  The 
20110126014145.000|20110126014148.000|TR0|dynamic will certainly be very different.  
20110126014148.000|20110126014150.000|TR0|It already is just in looking at the way 
20110126014150.000|20110126014152.000|TR0|members of Congress are talking to each 
20110126014152.000|20110126014154.000|TR0|other and chatting right now.
20110126014154.000|20110126014156.000|TR0|
20110126014156.000|20110126014158.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And you see, Dana, our viewers 
20110126014158.000|20110126014200.000|TR0|can see most of the members are wearing a 
20110126014200.000|20110126014202.000|TR0|ribbon.  That is a ribbon in honor of 
20110126014202.000|20110126014204.000|TR0|those who died and were injured in the 
20110126014204.000|20110126014206.000|TR0|Tucson shooting.  One member of the House 
20110126014206.000|20110126014208.000|TR0|of Representatives, Congresswoman 
20110126014208.000|20110126014211.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords, she was shot. She's 
20110126014211.000|20110126014213.000|TR0|recovering now in Houston.  Six people 
20110126014213.000|20110126014215.000|TR0|though were killed.
20110126014215.000|20110126014217.000|TR0|
20110126014217.000|20110126014219.000|TR0|There you see Senator Kerry and Senator 
20110126014219.000|20110126014221.000|TR0|McCain.  Joe Lieberman, they're walking in 
20110126014221.000|20110126014223.000|TR0|as well.  This is part of the tradition 
20110126014223.000|20110126014225.000|TR0|here on a State of the Union address night 
20110126014225.000|20110126014227.000|TR0|in Washington, D.C.
20110126014227.000|20110126014229.000|TR0|
20110126014229.000|20110126014232.000|TR0|It was interesting.  You already saw the 
20110126014232.000|20110126014234.000|TR0|president of the Senate. That's Vice 
20110126014234.000|20110126014236.000|TR0|President Joe Biden, the speaker of the 
20110126014236.000|20110126014238.000|TR0|House.  John Boehner, they're up there.  
20110126014238.000|20110126014240.000|TR0|They will be sitting behind the president 
20110126014240.000|20110126014242.000|TR0|once he delivers his State of the Union 
20110126014242.000|20110126014244.000|TR0|address.  At some points, no doubt Joe 
20110126014244.000|20110126014246.000|TR0|Biden will stand up and applaud.  John 
20110126014246.000|20110126014248.000|TR0|Boehner will sit down.  And we'll see if 
20110126014248.000|20110126014250.000|TR0|anything happens.  I doubt if John Boehner 
20110126014250.000|20110126014252.000|TR0|would ever stand up when Joe Biden was 
20110126014252.000|20110126014255.000|TR0|sitting down.  That would be 
20110126014255.000|20110126014257.000|TR0|extraordinary.  But you never know what 
20110126014257.000|20110126014259.000|TR0|happens in these kinds of circumstances.
20110126014259.000|20110126014301.000|TR0|
20110126014301.000|20110126014303.000|TR0|Piers Morgan is here with us.  Is there a 
20110126014303.000|20110126014305.000|TR0|tradition besides the queen's speech or 
20110126014305.000|20110126014307.000|TR0|the king's speech in Britain?  Is there 
20110126014307.000|20110126014309.000|TR0|anything similar to this?
20110126014309.000|20110126014311.000|TR0|
20110126014311.000|20110126014313.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I think you suggested the 
20110126014313.000|20110126014315.000|TR0|Conservatives and Labour Party that they 
20110126014315.000|20110126014318.000|TR0|would do this kind of thing.  There would 
20110126014318.000|20110126014320.000|TR0|be a mutiny.
20110126014320.000|20110126014322.000|TR0|
20110126014322.000|20110126014324.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Date night when they would sit 
20110126014324.000|20110126014326.000|TR0|together?
20110126014326.000|20110126014328.000|TR0|
20110126014328.000|20110126014330.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I don't want to be cynical 
20110126014330.000|20110126014332.000|TR0|because the sentiment behind this is very 
20110126014332.000|20110126014334.000|TR0|laudable, and it's great to see this.  I 
20110126014334.000|20110126014336.000|TR0|give it about a day, because it's going to 
20110126014336.000|20110126014338.000|TR0|be a moment when President Obama makes one 
20110126014338.000|20110126014341.000|TR0|of this dramatic pushes for applause, and 
20110126014341.000|20110126014343.000|TR0|it will look like most of the people are 
20110126014343.000|20110126014345.000|TR0|standing up and applauding, if you think 
20110126014345.000|20110126014347.000|TR0|about it. It's gone from half the room 
20110126014347.000|20110126014349.000|TR0|sitting down.  So the whole room with 
20110126014349.000|20110126014351.000|TR0|people standing up with just a few sitting 
20110126014351.000|20110126014353.000|TR0|in between.  It will look like he's 
20110126014353.000|20110126014355.000|TR0|getting a communal standing ovation.  And 
20110126014355.000|20110126014357.000|TR0|when the Republicans realize that, I would 
20110126014357.000|20110126014359.000|TR0|imagine this experiment will be over.
20110126014359.000|20110126014401.000|TR0|
20110126014401.000|20110126014404.000|TR0|GERGEN:  It's interesting, Wolf, that the 
20110126014404.000|20110126014406.000|TR0|British parliament, you know, they have 
20110126014406.000|20110126014408.000|TR0|the two parties sitting across from each 
20110126014408.000|20110126014410.000|TR0|other.  And when they stand to speak, 
20110126014410.000|20110126014412.000|TR0|they're more than a sword's point away.  
20110126014412.000|20110126014414.000|TR0|You cannot pick up a sword and hit the 
20110126014414.000|20110126014416.000|TR0|other guy.  That's a long tradition.
20110126014416.000|20110126014418.000|TR0|
20110126014418.000|20110126014420.000|TR0|MORGAN:  They would like to.  They love to.
20110126014420.000|20110126014422.000|TR0|
20110126014422.000|20110126014425.000|TR0|MARTIN:  I want to say, Wolf, when I heard 
20110126014425.000|20110126014427.000|TR0|Dana describe the two Democratic women 
20110126014427.000|20110126014429.000|TR0|sitting right next to Joe Wilson, I 
20110126014429.000|20110126014431.000|TR0|thought back to when I was in elementary 
20110126014431.000|20110126014433.000|TR0|school when you acted cool on the school 
20110126014433.000|20110126014435.000|TR0|bus. They would quiet all the guys down by 
20110126014435.000|20110126014437.000|TR0|having women sit right next to them.  
20110126014437.000|20110126014439.000|TR0|That's the first thing that came to my 
20110126014439.000|20110126014441.000|TR0|mind.  So everything --
20110126014441.000|20110126014443.000|TR0|
20110126014443.000|20110126014445.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Did they ever quiet you down?
20110126014445.000|20110126014448.000|TR0|
20110126014448.000|20110126014450.000|TR0|MARTIN:  It didn't happen.  It didn't 
20110126014450.000|20110126014452.000|TR0|happen.  That was practice.
20110126014452.000|20110126014454.000|TR0|
20110126014454.000|20110126014456.000|TR0|BLITZER:  There you see Chuck Schumer, Tom 
20110126014456.000|20110126014458.000|TR0|Coburn.  That's a political odd couple.  
20110126014458.000|20110126014500.000|TR0|There's the president and the first lady.  
20110126014500.000|20110126014502.000|TR0|They are now leaving the South Portico of 
20110126014502.000|20110126014504.000|TR0|the White House, getting into their 
20110126014504.000|20110126014506.000|TR0|limousine to make the short drive from the 
20110126014506.000|20110126014508.000|TR0|White House to the Capitol Hill.  And 
20110126014508.000|20110126014511.000|TR0|they'll go up there.
20110126014511.000|20110126014513.000|TR0|
20110126014513.000|20110126014515.000|TR0|The first lady has invited several 
20110126014515.000|20110126014517.000|TR0|important people to sit in her box up in 
20110126014517.000|20110126014519.000|TR0|the capitol, including Daniel Hernandez.  
20110126014519.000|20110126014521.000|TR0|He's that 21-year- old.  Today is his 
20110126014521.000|20110126014523.000|TR0|birthday, intern, congressional intern who 
20110126014523.000|20110126014525.000|TR0|helped save the life of Gabrielle 
20110126014525.000|20110126014527.000|TR0|Giffords, the congresswoman.  He was there 
20110126014527.000|20110126014529.000|TR0|on the scene.  He applied pressure to her 
20110126014529.000|20110126014531.000|TR0|head as she was bleeding. And by all 
20110126014531.000|20110126014534.000|TR0|accounts, that certainly helped in 
20110126014534.000|20110126014536.000|TR0|allowing her to live.
20110126014536.000|20110126014538.000|TR0|
20110126014538.000|20110126014540.000|TR0|Dr. Peter Rhee, the doctor, the trauma 
20110126014540.000|20110126014542.000|TR0|specialist who is there, you see members 
20110126014542.000|20110126014544.000|TR0|of the -- in the first lady's box right 
20110126014544.000|20110126014546.000|TR0|now.  He's been invited as well.  We saw 
20110126014546.000|20110126014548.000|TR0|him on television giving the briefings. 
20110126014548.000|20110126014550.000|TR0|And members of the Green Family, John and 
20110126014550.000|20110126014552.000|TR0|Roxanna, the parents of little Christina 
20110126014552.000|20110126014555.000|TR0|Taylor Green, the 9-year-old who was 
20110126014555.000|20110126014557.000|TR0|killed in that shooting rampage on that 
20110126014557.000|20110126014559.000|TR0|Saturday morning in Tucson.  They are 
20110126014559.000|20110126014601.000|TR0|there. Others have been invited by the 
20110126014601.000|20110126014603.000|TR0|first lady as well.
20110126014603.000|20110126014605.000|TR0|
20110126014605.000|20110126014607.000|TR0|They're making the short drive to Capitol 
20110126014607.000|20110126014609.000|TR0|Hill.  We'll take a quick break and 
20110126014609.000|20110126014611.000|TR0|continue our coverage.  We're only minutes 
20110126014611.000|20110126014613.000|TR0|away from the State of the Union address.  
20110126014613.000|20110126014615.000|TR0|That's coming up.
20110126014615.000|20110126014618.000|TR0|
20110126014618.000|20110126014620.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110126014620.000|20110126014622.000|TR0|
20110126014622.000|20110126014624.000|TR0|BLITZER:  You saw the president of the 
20110126014624.000|20110126014626.000|TR0|United States leave the White House with 
20110126014626.000|20110126014628.000|TR0|the first lady just a few moments ago.  A 
20110126014628.000|20110126014630.000|TR0|short drive from the White House to 
20110126014630.000|20110126014632.000|TR0|Capitol Hill.  They're getting ready to 
20110126014632.000|20110126014634.000|TR0|arrive.  We'll watch every step of the 
20110126014634.000|20110126014636.000|TR0|way.  The dignitaries are walking into the 
20110126014636.000|20110126014638.000|TR0|House chamber.  Not only members of the 
20110126014638.000|20110126014641.000|TR0|Senate, members of the House, but the 
20110126014641.000|20110126014643.000|TR0|diplomatic core, members of the Joint 
20110126014643.000|20110126014645.000|TR0|Chiefs of Staff.  Members of the United 
20110126014645.000|20110126014647.000|TR0|States Supreme Court as well. We're told 
20110126014647.000|20110126014649.000|TR0|the president's speech, most of it will 
20110126014649.000|20110126014651.000|TR0|deal with the economy and jobs and 
20110126014651.000|20110126014653.000|TR0|spending.
20110126014653.000|20110126014655.000|TR0|
20110126014655.000|20110126014657.000|TR0|Joe Johns is here with us.  And you've 
20110126014657.000|20110126014659.000|TR0|been looking at some of these numbers.  
20110126014659.000|20110126014701.000|TR0|And it's fascinating.  Our brand-new poll, 
20110126014701.000|20110126014704.000|TR0|what's going on?
20110126014704.000|20110126014706.000|TR0|
20110126014706.000|20110126014708.000|TR0|JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  It 
20110126014708.000|20110126014710.000|TR0|certainly is fascinating.  And one of the 
20110126014710.000|20110126014712.000|TR0|most fascinating things of all, Wolf, is 
20110126014712.000|20110126014714.000|TR0|the issue of deficit reduction.  People on 
20110126014714.000|20110126014716.000|TR0|Capitol Hill, people all over the country 
20110126014716.000|20110126014718.000|TR0|love to say they're into deficit 
20110126014718.000|20110126014720.000|TR0|reduction.  But the devil is in the 
20110126014720.000|20110126014722.000|TR0|details.  And the question is always where 
20110126014722.000|20110126014725.000|TR0|will you cut?  What's the most important? 
20110126014725.000|20110126014727.000|TR0|So in a poll we asked that very question.
20110126014727.000|20110126014729.000|TR0|
20110126014729.000|20110126014731.000|TR0|We started with entitlements.  What's the 
20110126014731.000|20110126014733.000|TR0|most important to you? Preventing cuts in 
20110126014733.000|20110126014735.000|TR0|social security or reducing the deficit? 
20110126014735.000|20110126014737.000|TR0|And it was very clear.  Most people were 
20110126014737.000|20110126014739.000|TR0|interested in preventing cuts to social 
20110126014739.000|20110126014741.000|TR0|security.
20110126014741.000|20110126014743.000|TR0|
20110126014743.000|20110126014745.000|TR0|Let's look at the next one.  Same thing, 
20110126014745.000|20110126014748.000|TR0|entitlements.  Medicare. You look at that 
20110126014748.000|20110126014750.000|TR0|number, surprising.  Eighty-one percent 
20110126014750.000|20110126014752.000|TR0|say they're more interested in preventing 
20110126014752.000|20110126014754.000|TR0|cuts to Medicare than reducing the 
20110126014754.000|20110126014756.000|TR0|deficit.  But you look at some other 
20110126014756.000|20110126014758.000|TR0|areas, and people say yes, I do want to 
20110126014758.000|20110126014800.000|TR0|cut them.  But there are areas like 
20110126014800.000|20110126014802.000|TR0|foreign aid, 81 percent more interested in 
20110126014802.000|20110126014804.000|TR0|reducing the deficit than keeping foreign 
20110126014804.000|20110126014806.000|TR0|aid going.  Of course, foreign aid only 
20110126014806.000|20110126014808.000|TR0|accounts for one percent of the federal 
20110126014808.000|20110126014811.000|TR0|budget.  And then the last one, of course, 
20110126014811.000|20110126014813.000|TR0|is one that we wanted to check on, 
20110126014813.000|20110126014815.000|TR0|government pensions.  Same thing.  
20110126014815.000|20110126014817.000|TR0|Sixty-one percent interested in reducing 
20110126014817.000|20110126014819.000|TR0|the deficit over government pensions. Of 
20110126014819.000|20110126014821.000|TR0|course, those people probably don't have 
20110126014821.000|20110126014823.000|TR0|government pensions.  So it's a mixed bag, 
20110126014823.000|20110126014825.000|TR0|but pretty clear, Wolf.  People don't know 
20110126014825.000|20110126014827.000|TR0|what to cut.  They expect these people in 
20110126014827.000|20110126014829.000|TR0|Capitol Hill to figure it out.
20110126014829.000|20110126014831.000|TR0|
20110126014831.000|20110126014834.000|TR0|BLITZER:  They want their cake and they 
20110126014834.000|20110126014836.000|TR0|want to eat it too.
20110126014836.000|20110126014838.000|TR0|
20110126014838.000|20110126014840.000|TR0|JOHNS:  That's right.
20110126014840.000|20110126014842.000|TR0|
20110126014842.000|20110126014844.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Joe, thanks very, very much.  
20110126014844.000|20110126014846.000|TR0|All right.
20110126014846.000|20110126014848.000|TR0|
20110126014848.000|20110126014850.000|TR0|The president of the United States is 
20110126014850.000|20110126014852.000|TR0|arriving.  You see the motorcade right 
20110126014852.000|20110126014855.000|TR0|there.  When the president travels, it's 
20110126014855.000|20110126014857.000|TR0|not just one car or two cars.  I've been 
20110126014857.000|20110126014859.000|TR0|in those motorcades.  It's probably 15 or 
20110126014859.000|20110126014901.000|TR0|16 cars, including as you see an 
20110126014901.000|20110126014903.000|TR0|ambulance, God forbid, if that is ever 
20110126014903.000|20110126014905.000|TR0|necessary.
20110126014905.000|20110126014907.000|TR0|
20110126014907.000|20110126014909.000|TR0|The president and the first lady, they're 
20110126014909.000|20110126014911.000|TR0|going to be going in. They'll be warmly 
20110126014911.000|20110126014913.000|TR0|received no doubt about that.  The first 
20110126014913.000|20110126014915.000|TR0|lady will go up.  Here is the speaker of 
20110126014915.000|20110126014918.000|TR0|the House with the vice president. Let's 
20110126014918.000|20110126014920.000|TR0|listen in briefly to see the business that 
20110126014920.000|20110126014922.000|TR0|they're engaging in right now.
20110126014922.000|20110126014924.000|TR0|
20110126014924.000|20110126014926.000|TR0|REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), HOUSE SPEAKER:  
20110126014926.000|20110126014928.000|TR0|California, Mr. McCarthy.  The gentleman 
20110126014928.000|20110126014930.000|TR0|from Texas, Mr. Hensarling.  The gentleman 
20110126014930.000|20110126014932.000|TR0|from Texas, Mr. Sessions.  The gentleman 
20110126014932.000|20110126014934.000|TR0|from Georgia, Mr. Price.  The gentlewoman 
20110126014934.000|20110126014936.000|TR0|from the state of Washington, Ms. McMorris 
20110126014936.000|20110126014938.000|TR0|Rodgers.  And the gentleman from Texas, 
20110126014938.000|20110126014941.000|TR0|Mr. Carter.
20110126014941.000|20110126014943.000|TR0|
20110126014943.000|20110126014945.000|TR0|The gentlewoman from California, Ms. 
20110126014945.000|20110126014947.000|TR0|Pelosi.  The gentleman from Maryland, Mr. 
20110126014947.000|20110126014949.000|TR0|Hoyer.  The gentleman from South Carolina, 
20110126014949.000|20110126014951.000|TR0|Mr. Clyburn. The gentleman from 
20110126014951.000|20110126014953.000|TR0|Connecticut, Mr. Larsen.  The gentleman 
20110126014953.000|20110126014955.000|TR0|from California, Mr. Becerra, and the 
20110126014955.000|20110126014957.000|TR0|gentleman from New York, Mr. Israel.
20110126014957.000|20110126014959.000|TR0|
20110126014959.000|20110126015001.000|TR0|BLITZER:  All right.  He's announcing 
20110126015001.000|20110126015004.000|TR0|what's called the escort committee.  These 
20110126015004.000|20110126015006.000|TR0|are the members who will escort the 
20110126015006.000|20110126015008.000|TR0|president of the United States.  Once he 
20110126015008.000|20110126015010.000|TR0|is introduced, once he walks in, they will 
20110126015010.000|20110126015012.000|TR0|follow him.  And here the vice president 
20110126015012.000|20110126015014.000|TR0|is going.
20110126015014.000|20110126015016.000|TR0|
20110126015016.000|20110126015018.000|TR0|This is a very equal chamber.  The House 
20110126015018.000|20110126015020.000|TR0|and the Senate equal, 435 members versus 
20110126015020.000|20110126015022.000|TR0|100 members.  But you see the vice 
20110126015022.000|20110126015025.000|TR0|president, he is now the president.  He's 
20110126015025.000|20110126015027.000|TR0|acting as the president of the United 
20110126015027.000|20110126015029.000|TR0|States Senate.
20110126015029.000|20110126015031.000|TR0|
20110126015031.000|20110126015033.000|TR0|David Gergen, let me bring you into this 
20110126015033.000|20110126015035.000|TR0|conversation.  Because as I said, they 
20110126015035.000|20110126015037.000|TR0|want their cake and they want to eat it 
20110126015037.000|20110126015039.000|TR0|too.  They want to cut, cut, cut.
20110126015039.000|20110126015041.000|TR0|
20110126015041.000|20110126015043.000|TR0|GERGEN:  That's right.
20110126015043.000|20110126015045.000|TR0|
20110126015045.000|20110126015048.000|TR0|BLITZER:  But they don't want to cut 
20110126015048.000|20110126015050.000|TR0|defense.  They don't want to cut Medicare. 
20110126015050.000|20110126015052.000|TR0| They don't want to cut social security.  
20110126015052.000|20110126015054.000|TR0|There is nothing they can do about the 
20110126015054.000|20110126015056.000|TR0|interest that the United States government 
20110126015056.000|20110126015058.000|TR0|has to pay.  So if you add up all of that, 
20110126015058.000|20110126015100.000|TR0|that's 80 or 90 percent of federal 
20110126015100.000|20110126015102.000|TR0|spending.  They basically want to talk 
20110126015102.000|20110126015104.000|TR0|about 10 or 15 percent, what's called 
20110126015104.000|20110126015106.000|TR0|discretionary spending.  And you're not 
20110126015106.000|20110126015108.000|TR0|going to do much in terms of reducing the 
20110126015108.000|20110126015111.000|TR0|deficit, reducing the national debt if 
20110126015111.000|20110126015113.000|TR0|you're just talking about that.
20110126015113.000|20110126015115.000|TR0|
20110126015115.000|20110126015117.000|TR0|GERGEN:  That's right.  It's only a small 
20110126015117.000|20110126015119.000|TR0|piece of it.  It's only really about 12 
20110126015119.000|20110126015121.000|TR0|percent of the budget.  So it's not very 
20110126015121.000|20110126015123.000|TR0|much.  But there is a fundamental 
20110126015123.000|20110126015125.000|TR0|difference between Republicans and 
20110126015125.000|20110126015127.000|TR0|Democrats and what to do.  The president 
20110126015127.000|20110126015129.000|TR0|wants to freeze at the current levels. The 
20110126015129.000|20110126015131.000|TR0|Republicans are saying wait a minute.  
20110126015131.000|20110126015134.000|TR0|Over the last two years, you've increased 
20110126015134.000|20110126015136.000|TR0|the current levels by 25 percent.  You 
20110126015136.000|20110126015138.000|TR0|want to freeze at a much, much higher 
20110126015138.000|20110126015140.000|TR0|level.  We want to take it back to where 
20110126015140.000|20110126015142.000|TR0|it was before you started.  That's a 
20110126015142.000|20110126015144.000|TR0|fundamental difference.
20110126015144.000|20110126015146.000|TR0|
20110126015146.000|20110126015148.000|TR0|But I have to tell you, Wolf, now, I think 
20110126015148.000|20110126015150.000|TR0|we've all had time to scan the president's 
20110126015150.000|20110126015152.000|TR0|speech and Ryan's speech.  It's not very 
20110126015152.000|20110126015154.000|TR0|many specifics.  We're going to have some 
20110126015154.000|20110126015157.000|TR0|disappointments.
20110126015157.000|20110126015159.000|TR0|
20110126015159.000|20110126015201.000|TR0|BLITZER:  But there are Republicans, 
20110126015201.000|20110126015203.000|TR0|Erick, who have radical ideas in terms of 
20110126015203.000|20110126015205.000|TR0|cutting spending, for example, the new 
20110126015205.000|20110126015207.000|TR0|senator from Kentucky, Rand Paul.  
20110126015207.000|20110126015209.000|TR0|Basically wants to do away with the 
20110126015209.000|20110126015211.000|TR0|Department of Education, do away with the 
20110126015211.000|20110126015213.000|TR0|Department of Energy.
20110126015213.000|20110126015215.000|TR0|
20110126015215.000|20110126015218.000|TR0|ERICKSON:  Those aren't necessarily 
20110126015218.000|20110126015220.000|TR0|radical ideas.  They've been around for 30 
20110126015220.000|20110126015222.000|TR0|years.
20110126015222.000|20110126015224.000|TR0|
20110126015224.000|20110126015226.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.
20110126015226.000|20110126015228.000|TR0|
20110126015228.000|20110126015230.000|TR0|ERICKSON:  There is no reason we can't 
20110126015230.000|20110126015232.000|TR0|restructure things.  In fact, the 
20110126015232.000|20110126015234.000|TR0|president says in his speech tonight they 
20110126015234.000|20110126015236.000|TR0|are going to restructure.  We' got the 
20110126015236.000|20110126015238.000|TR0|strange idea in this country that when 
20110126015238.000|20110126015241.000|TR0|businesses hit hard times, they can 
20110126015241.000|20110126015243.000|TR0|restructure but the federal government 
20110126015243.000|20110126015245.000|TR0|can't.  There's not necessarily a reason 
20110126015245.000|20110126015247.000|TR0|to keep the same cabinet departments we've 
20110126015247.000|20110126015249.000|TR0|had since George Washington.
20110126015249.000|20110126015251.000|TR0|
20110126015251.000|20110126015253.000|TR0|MARTIN:  But it's not just they when we 
20110126015253.000|20110126015255.000|TR0|talk about the politicians, it's also the 
20110126015255.000|20110126015257.000|TR0|people who send them to Washington, D.C. 
20110126015257.000|20110126015259.000|TR0|When you look at the CBS poll they laid 
20110126015259.000|20110126015301.000|TR0|out where they say, oh, no, we don't want 
20110126015301.000|20110126015304.000|TR0|taxes raised.  But we don't want cuts made 
20110126015304.000|20110126015306.000|TR0|to our social security or Medicare 
20110126015306.000|20110126015308.000|TR0|benefits.  And again, the American people 
20110126015308.000|20110126015310.000|TR0|also don't want their cake and eat it as 
20110126015310.000|20110126015312.000|TR0|well.  So they're also part of the 
20110126015312.000|20110126015314.000|TR0|problem.  We can't just sit here and say 
20110126015314.000|20110126015316.000|TR0|it's the 535 members in Congress.
20110126015316.000|20110126015318.000|TR0|
20110126015318.000|20110126015320.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Piers, let me just bring Piers 
20110126015320.000|20110126015322.000|TR0|in because they've had some radical cuts 
20110126015322.000|20110126015324.000|TR0|in Britain and elsewhere and Europe as 
20110126015324.000|20110126015327.000|TR0|well.  And folks aren't happy about it, 
20110126015327.000|20110126015329.000|TR0|but they have no choice.
20110126015329.000|20110126015331.000|TR0|
20110126015331.000|20110126015333.000|TR0|MORGAN:  And here's a fascinating 
20110126015333.000|20110126015335.000|TR0|parallel.  Britain has been through this 
20110126015335.000|20110126015337.000|TR0|exact kind of conundrum a few months ago.  
20110126015337.000|20110126015339.000|TR0|And David Cameron's government decided 
20110126015339.000|20110126015341.000|TR0|that they would go the Republican root. 
20110126015341.000|20110126015343.000|TR0|They would slash the deficit by cutting 
20110126015343.000|20110126015345.000|TR0|public spending.  And today, this morning, 
20110126015345.000|20110126015348.000|TR0|out came the figures.  The economy has 
20110126015348.000|20110126015350.000|TR0|shrunk by 0.5 percent.  There's been a 
20110126015350.000|20110126015352.000|TR0|massive reaction against this.
20110126015352.000|20110126015354.000|TR0|
20110126015354.000|20110126015356.000|TR0|Now, there are lots of excuses.  They're 
20110126015356.000|20110126015358.000|TR0|even blaming the weather.  The reality is 
20110126015358.000|20110126015400.000|TR0|if you do this you're taking a huge gamble 
20110126015400.000|20110126015402.000|TR0|with the strength of your economy.  And 
20110126015402.000|20110126015404.000|TR0|you now have a clear divide between the 
20110126015404.000|20110126015406.000|TR0|Republicans and the Democrats.  President 
20110126015406.000|20110126015408.000|TR0|Obama is saying freeze, invest, grow.  
20110126015408.000|20110126015411.000|TR0|Republicans are saying slash, don't 
20110126015411.000|20110126015413.000|TR0|invest, grow.  One will win.
20110126015413.000|20110126015415.000|TR0|
20110126015415.000|20110126015417.000|TR0|CROWLEY:  You can't do anything about this 
20110126015417.000|20110126015419.000|TR0|deficit unless you do something about 
20110126015419.000|20110126015421.000|TR0|social security, Medicare and Medicaid.  
20110126015421.000|20110126015423.000|TR0|At a breakfast this morning -- and defense.
20110126015423.000|20110126015425.000|TR0|
20110126015425.000|20110126015427.000|TR0|At a breakfast this morning with Speaker 
20110126015427.000|20110126015429.000|TR0|Boehner, he wouldn't say what he would go 
20110126015429.000|20110126015431.000|TR0|for in terms of social security, in terms 
20110126015431.000|20110126015434.000|TR0|of Medicare, like what sort of things.  
20110126015434.000|20110126015436.000|TR0|And that brings us back to what he called 
20110126015436.000|20110126015438.000|TR0|the educating of the public.  He said the 
20110126015438.000|20110126015440.000|TR0|president's got to go out.  I've got to go 
20110126015440.000|20110126015442.000|TR0|out.  We have to tell people how bad this 
20110126015442.000|20110126015444.000|TR0|is, because it's not a matter of oh, let's 
20110126015444.000|20110126015446.000|TR0|just cut it.  It's a matter if we don't 
20110126015446.000|20110126015448.000|TR0|cut it, these programs won't be here.  So 
20110126015448.000|20110126015450.000|TR0|they have to sell it first before they can 
20110126015450.000|20110126015452.000|TR0|do it.
20110126015452.000|20110126015454.000|TR0|
20110126015454.000|20110126015457.000|TR0|MARTIN:  Wolf, this is the problem.  This 
20110126015457.000|20110126015459.000|TR0|is what's going to happen.  When you even 
20110126015459.000|20110126015501.000|TR0|say cut defense, members of Congress will 
20110126015501.000|20110126015503.000|TR0|then say, oh, no, that's jobs in my 
20110126015503.000|20110126015505.000|TR0|district.  We saw it with GM.  They cut 
20110126015505.000|20110126015507.000|TR0|dealerships.  They said oh, no, that's 
20110126015507.000|20110126015509.000|TR0|jobs.  Jobs is also now used as a way to 
20110126015509.000|20110126015511.000|TR0|stop cutting.
20110126015511.000|20110126015513.000|TR0|
20110126015513.000|20110126015515.000|TR0|BLITZER:  That's now the ambassador from 
20110126015515.000|20110126015518.000|TR0|Djibouti.  He is the senior diplomat in 
20110126015518.000|20110126015520.000|TR0|Washington.  He's the dean of the 
20110126015520.000|20110126015522.000|TR0|diplomatic core. That's why he gets 
20110126015522.000|20110126015524.000|TR0|introduced as he does and is allowed to 
20110126015524.000|20110126015526.000|TR0|walk down.
20110126015526.000|20110126015528.000|TR0|
20110126015528.000|20110126015530.000|TR0|Djibouti.
20110126015530.000|20110126015532.000|TR0|
20110126015532.000|20110126015534.000|TR0|MARTIN:  OK, I'm just checking.
20110126015534.000|20110126015536.000|TR0|
20110126015536.000|20110126015538.000|TR0|BLITZER:  Yes.
20110126015538.000|20110126015541.000|TR0|
20110126015541.000|20110126015543.000|TR0|That's a dean of the diplomatic core.  Did 
20110126015543.000|20110126015545.000|TR0|you know that there was a dean of the 
20110126015545.000|20110126015547.000|TR0|Washington diplomatic core?
20110126015547.000|20110126015549.000|TR0|
20110126015549.000|20110126015551.000|TR0|MARTIN:  Not from Djibouti.
20110126015551.000|20110126015553.000|TR0|
20110126015553.000|20110126015555.000|TR0|MORGAN:  The only name I've heard before 
20110126015555.000|20110126015557.000|TR0|than Wolf Blitzer since I've been here.
20110126015557.000|20110126015559.000|TR0|
20110126015559.000|20110126015601.000|TR0|BLITZER:  I'm not even going to try to 
20110126015601.000|20110126015604.000|TR0|mention his name with all due respect to 
20110126015604.000|20110126015606.000|TR0|his Excellency, the ambassador for the 
20110126015606.000|20110126015608.000|TR0|Republic of Djibouti.
20110126015608.000|20110126015610.000|TR0|
20110126015610.000|20110126015612.000|TR0|Members of the Supreme Court -- members of 
20110126015612.000|20110126015614.000|TR0|the Supreme Court -- I know where Djibouti 
20110126015614.000|20110126015616.000|TR0|is.  But members of the Supreme Court are 
20110126015616.000|20110126015618.000|TR0|about to be introduced.  And we're told of 
20110126015618.000|20110126015620.000|TR0|the nine members, six will come in there.  
20110126015620.000|20110126015622.000|TR0|There you see John Roberts who is the 
20110126015622.000|20110126015624.000|TR0|chief justice of the United States walking 
20110126015624.000|20110126015627.000|TR0|in.  Three justices are not going to be 
20110126015627.000|20110126015629.000|TR0|there. Samuel Alito, for example, who was 
20110126015629.000|20110126015631.000|TR0|there, David, last year as you well 
20110126015631.000|20110126015633.000|TR0|remember.  He decided not to come back 
20110126015633.000|20110126015635.000|TR0|this year.
20110126015635.000|20110126015637.000|TR0|
20110126015637.000|20110126015639.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Well, there was a feeling that 
20110126015639.000|20110126015641.000|TR0|the president attacked the court.  And he 
20110126015641.000|20110126015643.000|TR0|did.  He attacked one of their decisions.  
20110126015643.000|20110126015645.000|TR0|And you remember Sam Alito was a guy who 
20110126015645.000|20110126015648.000|TR0|shook his head.  And that brought on a 
20110126015648.000|20110126015650.000|TR0|sharp exchange.  There was some talk about 
20110126015650.000|20110126015652.000|TR0|the court not even coming this year.  I'm 
20110126015652.000|20110126015654.000|TR0|glad they're there.  It's a good tradition.
20110126015654.000|20110126015656.000|TR0|
20110126015656.000|20110126015658.000|TR0|MARTIN:  I think it's hilarious you can 
20110126015658.000|20110126015700.000|TR0|criticize Congress and the presidency, but 
20110126015700.000|20110126015702.000|TR0|you can't criticize the third branch of 
20110126015702.000|20110126015704.000|TR0|government.
20110126015704.000|20110126015706.000|TR0|
20110126015706.000|20110126015708.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, but to be fair --
20110126015708.000|20110126015711.000|TR0|
20110126015711.000|20110126015713.000|TR0|ERICKSON:  They don't respond during the 
20110126015713.000|20110126015715.000|TR0|speech.  And so at least the Republicans 
20110126015715.000|20110126015717.000|TR0|and Democrats can respond.  And the court 
20110126015717.000|20110126015719.000|TR0|just sits there on its hands, by and large.
20110126015719.000|20110126015721.000|TR0|
20110126015721.000|20110126015723.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Exactly.  Exactly.
20110126015723.000|20110126015725.000|TR0|
20110126015725.000|20110126015727.000|TR0|BLITZER:  But they don't have to come.  
20110126015727.000|20110126015729.000|TR0|Usually they come.  There are times that 
20110126015729.000|20110126015731.000|TR0|no members of the Supreme Court come.  And 
20110126015731.000|20110126015734.000|TR0|this time they come.
20110126015734.000|20110126015736.000|TR0|
20110126015736.000|20110126015738.000|TR0|There you see the first lady walking into 
20110126015738.000|20110126015740.000|TR0|the box.  Then you see Dr. Jill Biden, the 
20110126015740.000|20110126015742.000|TR0|wife of the vice president.  She is there 
20110126015742.000|20110126015744.000|TR0|as well. She's got her special guests who 
20110126015744.000|20110126015746.000|TR0|are there as well.  And we'll talk about 
20110126015746.000|20110126015748.000|TR0|them a little bit.  But this is a special 
20110126015748.000|20110126015750.000|TR0|moment.
20110126015750.000|20110126015752.000|TR0|
20110126015752.000|20110126015754.000|TR0|John King is up on Capitol Hill watching 
20110126015754.000|20110126015757.000|TR0|all of this unfold.
20110126015757.000|20110126015759.000|TR0|
20110126015759.000|20110126015801.000|TR0|John, the guests that the first lady 
20110126015801.000|20110126015803.000|TR0|invites to sit in that box, it's really 
20110126015803.000|20110126015805.000|TR0|important because symbolically, it sort of 
20110126015805.000|20110126015807.000|TR0|underscores a theme that a president 
20110126015807.000|20110126015809.000|TR0|delivers.
20110126015809.000|20110126015811.000|TR0|
20110126015811.000|20110126015813.000|TR0|VOICE OF JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL 
20110126015813.000|20110126015815.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly does.  And 
20110126015815.000|20110126015818.000|TR0|the president will talk about military 
20110126015818.000|20110126015820.000|TR0|families and how it's important the 
20110126015820.000|20110126015822.000|TR0|country stick with them at a time many 
20110126015822.000|20110126015824.000|TR0|people don't like to talk about Iraq and 
20110126015824.000|20110126015826.000|TR0|Afghanistan.  There are military families 
20110126015826.000|20110126015828.000|TR0|there.  But mostly, you will see the 
20110126015828.000|20110126015830.000|TR0|heroes of Tucson there, Daniel Hernandez, 
20110126015830.000|20110126015832.000|TR0|the intern who helped Congresswoman Gabby 
20110126015832.000|20110126015834.000|TR0|Giffords.  The doctors who cared for her.  
20110126015834.000|20110126015836.000|TR0|It is an effort for the president to touch 
20110126015836.000|20110126015838.000|TR0|on it and pay tribute to the Tucson 
20110126015838.000|20110126015841.000|TR0|tragedy, but also to use the tragedy and 
20110126015841.000|20110126015843.000|TR0|the civility that came after it to pivot 
20110126015843.000|20110126015845.000|TR0|his agenda and try to ask this Republican 
20110126015845.000|20110126015847.000|TR0|Congress to work with him.
20110126015847.000|20110126015849.000|TR0|
20110126015849.000|20110126015851.000|TR0|As you see, the president's cabinet coming 
20110126015851.000|20110126015853.000|TR0|in into the chamber now, as well.  Wolf, 
20110126015853.000|20110126015855.000|TR0|Secretary of State Clinton there at the 
20110126015855.000|20110126015857.000|TR0|beginning.  There's the cabinet.  Ken 
20110126015857.000|20110126015859.000|TR0|Salazar, the interior secretary we are 
20110126015859.000|20110126015901.000|TR0|told is the designated cabinet member who 
20110126015901.000|20110126015904.000|TR0|will not come. Always one left out, God 
20110126015904.000|20110126015906.000|TR0|forbid in case of some tragedy.  One 
20110126015906.000|20110126015908.000|TR0|member of the president's cabinet does not 
20110126015908.000|20110126015910.000|TR0|attend this speech tonight, Wolf.
20110126015910.000|20110126015912.000|TR0|
20110126015912.000|20110126015914.000|TR0|BLITZER:  And there you see Secretary of
