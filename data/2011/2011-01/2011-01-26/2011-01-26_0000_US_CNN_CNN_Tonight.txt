20110126000007.000|20110126000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST:  Thanks Wolf and good 
20110126000009.000|20110126000011.000|TR0|evening everyone.  Welcome to our special 
20110126000011.000|20110126000014.000|TR0|coverage tonight live from Capitol Hill 
20110126000014.000|20110126000016.000|TR0|where in just two hours the president of 
20110126000016.000|20110126000019.000|TR0|the United States delivers his State of 
20110126000019.000|20110126000021.000|TR0|the Union Address to the Congress and to 
20110126000021.000|20110126000024.000|TR0|the American people.  It will be a very 
20110126000024.000|20110126000026.000|TR0|different speech this year.  The 
20110126000026.000|20110126000028.000|TR0|Democratic president will be speaking in a 
20110126000028.000|20110126000031.000|TR0|House chamber now under Republican control 
20110126000031.000|20110126000033.000|TR0|and to a country that delivered what the 
20110126000033.000|20110126000036.000|TR0|president himself called an election 
20110126000036.000|20110126000038.000|TR0|shellacking just 12 weeks ago.
20110126000038.000|20110126000041.000|TR0|
20110126000041.000|20110126000043.000|TR0|But tonight President Obama will outline a 
20110126000043.000|20110126000046.000|TR0|course he hopes will strengthen a fragile 
20110126000046.000|20110126000048.000|TR0|economic recovery, not to mention his own 
20110126000048.000|20110126000050.000|TR0|reelection prospects.  He will acknowledge 
20110126000050.000|20110126000053.000|TR0|the ties and increase Republican power 
20110126000053.000|20110126000055.000|TR0|here in Washington, mandate a focus on 
20110126000055.000|20110126000058.000|TR0|deficit reduction.  And we're told the 
20110126000058.000|20110126000100.000|TR0|president will call for a five-year freeze 
20110126000100.000|20110126000103.000|TR0|on federal spending.
20110126000103.000|20110126000105.000|TR0|
20110126000105.000|20110126000107.000|TR0|But the president will also forcibly make 
20110126000107.000|20110126000110.000|TR0|the case for some new targeted spending.  
20110126000110.000|20110126000112.000|TR0|Investment is his preferred word and 
20110126000112.000|20110126000115.000|TR0|infrastructure and research and 
20110126000115.000|20110126000117.000|TR0|development.  Most Republicans already 
20110126000117.000|20110126000120.000|TR0|have said no that there's no room for new 
20110126000120.000|20110126000122.000|TR0|spending and that a spending freeze isn't 
20110126000122.000|20110126000125.000|TR0|enough, that there must, must be deep 
20110126000125.000|20110126000127.000|TR0|budget cuts.  We have a packed hour ahead 
20110126000127.000|20110126000129.000|TR0|with new details of the president's 
20110126000129.000|20110126000132.000|TR0|proposals and new drama as the Republicans 
20110126000132.000|20110126000134.000|TR0|answer with not one but two responses, 
20110126000134.000|20110126000137.000|TR0|exposing a new continuing Tea Party 
20110126000137.000|20110126000139.000|TR0|tensions with the GOP establishment.
20110126000139.000|20110126000142.000|TR0|
20110126000142.000|20110126000144.000|TR0|Let's set the table with what you need to 
20110126000144.000|20110126000146.000|TR0|know right now.  Our senior congressional 
20110126000146.000|20110126000149.000|TR0|correspondent Dana Bash is with me here on 
20110126000149.000|20110126000151.000|TR0|Capitol Hill but first senior White House 
20110126000151.000|20110126000154.000|TR0|correspondent Ed Henry with the latest on 
20110126000154.000|20110126000156.000|TR0|the president's proposals and his goals -- 
20110126000156.000|20110126000159.000|TR0|Ed.
20110126000159.000|20110126000201.000|TR0|
20110126000201.000|20110126000204.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
20110126000204.000|20110126000206.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  John, what's interesting 
20110126000206.000|20110126000208.000|TR0|to me is that senior aides are saying the 
20110126000208.000|20110126000211.000|TR0|president is going to use two very recent 
20110126000211.000|20110126000213.000|TR0|events, the midterm election as well as 
20110126000213.000|20110126000216.000|TR0|that Tucson shooting tragedy to try and 
20110126000216.000|20110126000218.000|TR0|grab the attention not just of the 
20110126000218.000|20110126000221.000|TR0|Congress but the entire nation.  In the 
20110126000221.000|20110126000223.000|TR0|words of one top aide, the president's 
20110126000223.000|20110126000225.000|TR0|message is going to be quote, "lower the 
20110126000225.000|20110126000228.000|TR0|tone and raise your sights", the sights 
20110126000228.000|20110126000230.000|TR0|about the future that the president is 
20110126000230.000|20110126000233.000|TR0|going to have what aides says is very 
20110126000233.000|20110126000235.000|TR0|optimistic, sort of Ronald Reaganesque 
20110126000235.000|20110126000238.000|TR0|kind of tone to this speech.
20110126000238.000|20110126000240.000|TR0|
20110126000240.000|20110126000243.000|TR0|He's going to note that Gabby Giffords is 
20110126000243.000|20110126000245.000|TR0|not in the chamber tonight and he's going 
20110126000245.000|20110126000247.000|TR0|to say look it's a good thing the 
20110126000247.000|20110126000250.000|TR0|Democrats and Republicans are sitting side 
20110126000250.000|20110126000252.000|TR0|by side tonight, but that the key is going 
20110126000252.000|20110126000255.000|TR0|to be what are you doing next week and the 
20110126000255.000|20110126000257.000|TR0|week after?  Are you coming together on 
20110126000257.000|20110126000300.000|TR0|some of these big issues?  And secondly in 
20110126000300.000|20110126000302.000|TR0|terms of the election he's going to say 
20110126000302.000|20110126000305.000|TR0|look, it's over, it's in the past, we got 
20110126000305.000|20110126000307.000|TR0|the message, now what are you going to do 
20110126000307.000|20110126000309.000|TR0|moving forward?
20110126000309.000|20110126000312.000|TR0|
20110126000312.000|20110126000314.000|TR0|And so he's going to be talking a lot 
20110126000314.000|20110126000317.000|TR0|about the economy in that context and 
20110126000317.000|20110126000319.000|TR0|saying both sides need to come together on 
20110126000319.000|20110126000322.000|TR0|that, noting that Wall Street is doing 
20110126000322.000|20110126000324.000|TR0|pretty well right now.  Corporate profits 
20110126000324.000|20110126000326.000|TR0|are up but at 9.4 percent unemployment 
20110126000326.000|20110126000329.000|TR0|this president realizes a lot of Americans 
20110126000329.000|20110126000331.000|TR0|are not feeling that bounce right now and 
20110126000331.000|20110126000334.000|TR0|that's why there's going to be some tough 
20110126000334.000|20110126000336.000|TR0|choices to fix this.  You mentioned that 
20110126000336.000|20110126000339.000|TR0|five-year budget freeze.  The president is 
20110126000339.000|20110126000341.000|TR0|going to say look these are tough choices 
20110126000341.000|20110126000344.000|TR0|and it's this generation's sputnik moment, 
20110126000344.000|20110126000346.000|TR0|John.
20110126000346.000|20110126000348.000|TR0|
20110126000348.000|20110126000351.000|TR0|KING:  Ed, stand by one second.  I want to 
20110126000351.000|20110126000353.000|TR0|bring Dana Bash into the conversation.  
20110126000353.000|20110126000356.000|TR0|You hear Ed, the president acknowledging 
20110126000356.000|20110126000358.000|TR0|the new environment.  From the official 
20110126000358.000|20110126000401.000|TR0|Republican response already we have a 
20110126000401.000|20110126000403.000|TR0|sense that essentially what he's going to 
20110126000403.000|20110126000405.000|TR0|say is don't believe what you just heard.  
20110126000405.000|20110126000408.000|TR0|We've heard this before.
20110126000408.000|20110126000410.000|TR0|
20110126000410.000|20110126000413.000|TR0|DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL 
20110126000413.000|20110126000415.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Oh there's no question 
20110126000415.000|20110126000418.000|TR0|about it.  Look, as much as this is a test 
20110126000418.000|20110126000420.000|TR0|for the president coming before a new 
20110126000420.000|20110126000423.000|TR0|Congress, this is a test for the new 
20110126000423.000|20110126000425.000|TR0|Congress and Republicans who now control 
20110126000425.000|20110126000427.000|TR0|the House especially, they're well aware 
20110126000427.000|20110126000430.000|TR0|of that.  We saw that in the hours leading 
20110126000430.000|20110126000432.000|TR0|up to the speech tonight in that very 
20110126000432.000|20110126000435.000|TR0|House chamber where he is going to speak.
20110126000435.000|20110126000437.000|TR0|
20110126000437.000|20110126000440.000|TR0|The Republicans passed a resolution saying 
20110126000440.000|20110126000442.000|TR0|we're going to keep our campaign promise 
20110126000442.000|20110126000444.000|TR0|to roll back spending to -- your president 
20110126000444.000|20110126000447.000|TR0|-- Mr. President back to 2008 levels and 
20110126000447.000|20110126000449.000|TR0|you mentioned the speech that we're going 
20110126000449.000|20110126000452.000|TR0|to see immediately afterward.  It is from 
20110126000452.000|20110126000454.000|TR0|the House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan.  We 
20110126000454.000|20110126000457.000|TR0|did just get some new excerpts where he's 
20110126000457.000|20110126000459.000|TR0|going to make clear -- we've heard from 
20110126000459.000|20110126000502.000|TR0|Republicans over and over that investments 
20110126000502.000|20110126000504.000|TR0|as you mentioned, investments is really 
20110126000504.000|20110126000506.000|TR0|about new spending.
20110126000506.000|20110126000509.000|TR0|
20110126000509.000|20110126000511.000|TR0|And he's going to saying look, 25 percent. 
20110126000511.000|20110126000514.000|TR0| That was the increase in domestic 
20110126000514.000|20110126000516.000|TR0|government agency since President Obama 
20110126000516.000|20110126000519.000|TR0|has been president, 84 percent if you 
20110126000519.000|20110126000521.000|TR0|include the stimulus.  And as you 
20110126000521.000|20110126000523.000|TR0|mentioned he's going to say all of this 
20110126000523.000|20110126000526.000|TR0|new government spending was sold on us as 
20110126000526.000|20110126000528.000|TR0|investment but that didn't happen from his 
20110126000528.000|20110126000531.000|TR0|perspective and from Republicans' 
20110126000531.000|20110126000533.000|TR0|perspective because look at where the 
20110126000533.000|20110126000536.000|TR0|unemployment rate is right now.
20110126000536.000|20110126000538.000|TR0|
20110126000538.000|20110126000541.000|TR0|KING:  And Ed Henry, the president comes 
20110126000541.000|20110126000543.000|TR0|here with the polls showing he's had a bit 
20110126000543.000|20110126000545.000|TR0|of a rebound since the election, but he 
20110126000545.000|20110126000548.000|TR0|has to know this is his moment, going into 
20110126000548.000|20110126000550.000|TR0|these, what will be a tough year ahead 
20110126000550.000|20110126000553.000|TR0|especially with the Republican House, that 
20110126000553.000|20110126000555.000|TR0|if he is going to get the upper hand and 
20110126000555.000|20110126000558.000|TR0|the early stage, if you will, tonight is 
20110126000558.000|20110126000600.000|TR0|his big chance.
20110126000600.000|20110126000603.000|TR0|
20110126000603.000|20110126000605.000|TR0|HENRY:  It really is.  They realize this 
20110126000605.000|20110126000607.000|TR0|is the chance to grab the nation's 
20110126000607.000|20110126000610.000|TR0|attention on that very issue.  And what 
20110126000610.000|20110126000612.000|TR0|he's going to try to lay out is, look, 
20110126000612.000|20110126000615.000|TR0|while it seems like there are big 
20110126000615.000|20110126000617.000|TR0|differences and there are the fact of the 
20110126000617.000|20110126000620.000|TR0|matter is that right after that midterm 
20110126000620.000|20110126000622.000|TR0|election we saw in December both sides 
20110126000622.000|20110126000624.000|TR0|come together on the tax deal, on 
20110126000624.000|20110126000627.000|TR0|repealing "don't ask, don't tell".  He's 
20110126000627.000|20110126000629.000|TR0|going to try to build on that to say, 
20110126000629.000|20110126000632.000|TR0|look, there are going to be a lot of 
20110126000632.000|20110126000634.000|TR0|fights ahead because there's another 
20110126000634.000|20110126000637.000|TR0|election coming up.
20110126000637.000|20110126000639.000|TR0|
20110126000639.000|20110126000642.000|TR0|But there's another narrow window here in 
20110126000642.000|20110126000644.000|TR0|the next few months to get some other big 
20110126000644.000|20110126000646.000|TR0|things done on cutting the deficit, for 
20110126000646.000|20110126000649.000|TR0|example. That's why he's going to call for 
20110126000649.000|20110126000651.000|TR0|that budget freeze.  And he's going to 
20110126000651.000|20110126000654.000|TR0|sort of issue a challenge tonight to this 
20110126000654.000|20110126000656.000|TR0|Congress, to put some of those differences 
20110126000656.000|20110126000659.000|TR0|aside, at least work together for a few 
20110126000659.000|20110126000701.000|TR0|months before the elections pretty much 
20110126000701.000|20110126000703.000|TR0|take over -- John.
20110126000703.000|20110126000706.000|TR0|
20110126000706.000|20110126000708.000|TR0|KING:  Ed Henry at the White House.  Thank 
20110126000708.000|20110126000711.000|TR0|you.  Ed will be with us throughout our 
20110126000711.000|20110126000713.000|TR0|coverage tonight and Dana, before I let 
20110126000713.000|20110126000716.000|TR0|you go, a quick point on the atmospherics. 
20110126000716.000|20110126000718.000|TR0| Date night, prom night many have called 
20110126000718.000|20110126000721.000|TR0|it.  It will look different on the floor 
20110126000721.000|20110126000723.000|TR0|but how long will that last, until the 
20110126000723.000|20110126000725.000|TR0|president leaves the chamber, when we get 
20110126000725.000|20110126000728.000|TR0|to the spending, the budget issues, back 
20110126000728.000|20110126000730.000|TR0|to the health care fight?
20110126000730.000|20110126000733.000|TR0|
20110126000733.000|20110126000735.000|TR0|BASH:  Or will it even not last while the 
20110126000735.000|20110126000738.000|TR0|president is in the chamber because yes, 
20110126000738.000|20110126000740.000|TR0|Republicans and Democrats are going to be 
20110126000740.000|20110126000742.000|TR0|sitting together, but it is hard to 
20110126000742.000|20110126000745.000|TR0|imagine that you won't still have 
20110126000745.000|20110126000747.000|TR0|Democrats standing up at the logical 
20110126000747.000|20110126000750.000|TR0|applause lines for their issues and 
20110126000750.000|20110126000752.000|TR0|Republicans sitting on their hands or 
20110126000752.000|20110126000755.000|TR0|maybe standing up for the logical applause 
20110126000755.000|20110126000757.000|TR0|lines on their side.
20110126000757.000|20110126000800.000|TR0|
20110126000800.000|20110126000802.000|TR0|But, look, the reality is that it is going 
20110126000802.000|20110126000804.000|TR0|to feel different. Already I was in the 
20110126000804.000|20110126000807.000|TR0|chamber before coming over here.  I saw 
20110126000807.000|20110126000809.000|TR0|the kind of typical members of Congress 
20110126000809.000|20110126000812.000|TR0|who sit there for hours and hours, who 
20110126000812.000|20110126000814.000|TR0|wait and hold their seats.  Now they're 
20110126000814.000|20110126000817.000|TR0|doing it together.  Eliot Engel of New 
20110126000817.000|20110126000819.000|TR0|York, Jean Schmidt of Ohio, they're 
20110126000819.000|20110126000821.000|TR0|sitting next to each other on the 
20110126000821.000|20110126000824.000|TR0|Republican side of the aisle.
20110126000824.000|20110126000826.000|TR0|
20110126000826.000|20110126000829.000|TR0|KING:  We'll see how that one plays out.  
20110126000829.000|20110126000831.000|TR0|Dana Bash, thank you. Dana will be with us 
20110126000831.000|20110126000834.000|TR0|all night too.
20110126000834.000|20110126000836.000|TR0|
20110126000836.000|20110126000839.000|TR0|When the president speaks tonight, the 
20110126000839.000|20110126000841.000|TR0|most immediate sign of how much Washington 
20110126000841.000|20110126000843.000|TR0|has changed will be over his shoulder.  
20110126000843.000|20110126000846.000|TR0|The Republican John Boehner will be in the 
20110126000846.000|20110126000848.000|TR0|speaker's chair.  The new Republican 
20110126000848.000|20110126000851.000|TR0|majority says cutting spending is by far 
20110126000851.000|20110126000853.000|TR0|its top mission and already there are 
20110126000853.000|20110126000856.000|TR0|signs some Republicans want to cut even 
20110126000856.000|20110126000858.000|TR0|more than their leadership.  Among them is 
20110126000858.000|20110126000901.000|TR0|Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana who gave 
20110126000901.000|20110126000903.000|TR0|up a leadership post because he wanted the 
20110126000903.000|20110126000905.000|TR0|freedom to speak more freely and the 
20110126000905.000|20110126000908.000|TR0|freedom perhaps to consider a run for 
20110126000908.000|20110126000910.000|TR0|president. Congressman it's good to see 
20110126000910.000|20110126000913.000|TR0|you on this night.
20110126000913.000|20110126000915.000|TR0|
20110126000915.000|20110126000918.000|TR0|REP. MIKE PENCE (R), INDIANA:  Thank you, 
20110126000918.000|20110126000920.000|TR0|John.
20110126000920.000|20110126000922.000|TR0|
20110126000922.000|20110126000925.000|TR0|KING:  You do not believe there's any room 
20110126000925.000|20110126000927.000|TR0|for new spending at this moment, correct?
20110126000927.000|20110126000930.000|TR0|
20110126000930.000|20110126000932.000|TR0|PENCE:  Well it's not just what I believe, 
20110126000932.000|20110126000935.000|TR0|John.  I think the American people sent a 
20110126000935.000|20110126000937.000|TR0|deafening message on Election Day last 
20110126000937.000|20110126000940.000|TR0|November that they want a fundamental 
20110126000940.000|20110126000942.000|TR0|change of direction.  They want us to end 
20110126000942.000|20110126000944.000|TR0|this era of borrowing and spending and 
20110126000944.000|20110126000947.000|TR0|bailouts and takeovers and turn this 
20110126000947.000|20110126000949.000|TR0|national government back into the 
20110126000949.000|20110126000952.000|TR0|direction of fiscal solvency and reform.
20110126000952.000|20110126000954.000|TR0|
20110126000954.000|20110126000957.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)      KING:  So what does the 
20110126000957.000|20110126000959.000|TR0|president have to do that he will call 
20110126000959.000|20110126001001.000|TR0|this a sputnik moment.  He will say just 
20110126001001.000|20110126001004.000|TR0|like John Kennedy responded to the Soviets 
20110126001004.000|20110126001006.000|TR0|who were in space before us that if we 
20110126001006.000|20110126001009.000|TR0|don't invest in research and development, 
20110126001009.000|20110126001011.000|TR0|in new roads and bridges, in new science 
20110126001011.000|20110126001014.000|TR0|projects --
20110126001014.000|20110126001016.000|TR0|
20110126001016.000|20110126001019.000|TR0|PENCE:  Right.
20110126001019.000|20110126001021.000|TR0|
20110126001021.000|20110126001023.000|TR0|KING:  -- that we will fall behind China, 
20110126001023.000|20110126001026.000|TR0|behind India.  Is that completely out of 
20110126001026.000|20110126001028.000|TR0|the realm or will you say, I will listen 
20110126001028.000|20110126001031.000|TR0|to you, Mr. President, if you show me 
20110126001031.000|20110126001033.000|TR0|first a lot of cuts.
20110126001033.000|20110126001036.000|TR0|
20110126001036.000|20110126001038.000|TR0|PENCE:  Well let me say we welcome the 
20110126001038.000|20110126001040.000|TR0|president of the United States to the 
20110126001040.000|20110126001043.000|TR0|House chamber today.  He'll be given the 
20110126001043.000|20110126001045.000|TR0|respect that both he and his office are 
20110126001045.000|20110126001048.000|TR0|due, but, you know, I'm thinking back of 
20110126001048.000|20110126001050.000|TR0|the 1990s in the Clinton era when I think 
20110126001050.000|20110126001053.000|TR0|the word investment became a synonym for 
20110126001053.000|20110126001055.000|TR0|more federal spending.  Not only are House 
20110126001055.000|20110126001058.000|TR0|Republicans onto that, John, I think the 
20110126001058.000|20110126001100.000|TR0|American people are on to that.
20110126001100.000|20110126001102.000|TR0|
20110126001102.000|20110126001105.000|TR0|They know that we're running now multiple 
20110126001105.000|20110126001107.000|TR0|years in a row more than $1 trillion 
20110126001107.000|20110126001110.000|TR0|deficits, the kind of investment we should 
20110126001110.000|20110126001112.000|TR0|be encouraging is investment in America by 
20110126001112.000|20110126001115.000|TR0|Americans and by American businesses and, 
20110126001115.000|20110126001117.000|TR0|frankly, many of us are hoping tonight 
20110126001117.000|20110126001119.000|TR0|that the president will open the door to 
20110126001119.000|20110126001122.000|TR0|additional tax relief that will release 
20110126001122.000|20110126001124.000|TR0|some of those corporate profits, 
20110126001124.000|20110126001127.000|TR0|additional tax relief that will encourage 
20110126001127.000|20110126001129.000|TR0|investment by Americans in the city and on 
20110126001129.000|20110126001132.000|TR0|the farm in ways that will create jobs.  
20110126001132.000|20110126001134.000|TR0|Washington investment is not going to get 
20110126001134.000|20110126001137.000|TR0|this economy moving again.  Getting the 
20110126001137.000|20110126001139.000|TR0|American people to invest and believe in 
20110126001139.000|20110126001141.000|TR0|their future again will.
20110126001141.000|20110126001144.000|TR0|
20110126001144.000|20110126001146.000|TR0|KING:  Tonight is in many ways the first 
20110126001146.000|20110126001149.000|TR0|act in a great new drama of divided 
20110126001149.000|20110126001151.000|TR0|government.  And not only do you have how 
20110126001151.000|20110126001154.000|TR0|will the president and the new Republican 
20110126001154.000|20110126001156.000|TR0|House get along but you have in your own 
20110126001156.000|20110126001159.000|TR0|caucus in the House debates about the 
20110126001159.000|20110126001201.000|TR0|levels of cuts that should be necessary 
20110126001201.000|20110126001203.000|TR0|and you have seen this play out in recent 
20110126001203.000|20110126001206.000|TR0|days where I believe you are on the side 
20110126001206.000|20110126001208.000|TR0|of those saying the leadership so far is 
20110126001208.000|20110126001211.000|TR0|being too timid, needs to cut even more.  
20110126001211.000|20110126001213.000|TR0|You obviously only control the House of 
20110126001213.000|20110126001216.000|TR0|Representatives, so how far do you think 
20110126001216.000|20110126001218.000|TR0|the House needs to go, essentially for 
20110126001218.000|20110126001220.000|TR0|leverage when you get into the 
20110126001220.000|20110126001223.000|TR0|negotiations with a narrowly Democratic 
20110126001223.000|20110126001225.000|TR0|Senate and a Democratic president who 
20110126001225.000|20110126001228.000|TR0|won't do -- you won't get as much as you 
20110126001228.000|20110126001230.000|TR0|want and you know that.
20110126001230.000|20110126001233.000|TR0|
20110126001233.000|20110126001235.000|TR0|PENCE:  Well, look.  I don't know that.  I 
20110126001235.000|20110126001238.000|TR0|really believe that a minority in the 
20110126001238.000|20110126001240.000|TR0|Senate plus the American people equals a 
20110126001240.000|20110126001242.000|TR0|majority and House Republicans are 
20110126001242.000|20110126001245.000|TR0|determined to do two things.  Number one, 
20110126001245.000|20110126001247.000|TR0|we're going to keep our promise to the 
20110126001247.000|20110126001250.000|TR0|American people.  Our resolution today, we 
20110126001250.000|20110126001252.000|TR0|embraced $100 million in cuts this year.  
20110126001252.000|20110126001255.000|TR0|But as we move legislation forward in the 
20110126001255.000|20110126001257.000|TR0|coming weeks, you're going to see House 
20110126001257.000|20110126001259.000|TR0|Republicans say we can do more.  We can -- 
20110126001259.000|20110126001302.000|TR0|we can find greater savings in every area 
20110126001302.000|20110126001304.000|TR0|of government.  We're going to lay out 
20110126001304.000|20110126001307.000|TR0|both in a resolution, in the debt ceiling 
20110126001307.000|20110126001309.000|TR0|vote ultimately in our budget, as Paul 
20110126001309.000|20110126001312.000|TR0|Ryan will discuss tonight, a vision for 
20110126001312.000|20110126001314.000|TR0|really putting our nation back on a 
20110126001314.000|20110126001317.000|TR0|pathway toward fiscal solvency and that 
20110126001317.000|20110126001319.000|TR0|lodestar of a balanced federal budget.  
20110126001319.000|20110126001321.000|TR0|The American people know we have to do 
20110126001321.000|20110126001324.000|TR0|better.  House Republicans are going to 
20110126001324.000|20110126001326.000|TR0|drive toward that and I believe with the 
20110126001326.000|20110126001329.000|TR0|American people on our side, anything is 
20110126001329.000|20110126001331.000|TR0|possible.     KING:  You mentioned the 
20110126001331.000|20110126001334.000|TR0|official response from Paul Ryan. Michele 
20110126001334.000|20110126001336.000|TR0|Bachmann will also give a response.  It 
20110126001336.000|20110126001338.000|TR0|was originally set up as just to go to the 
20110126001338.000|20110126001341.000|TR0|Web site of the Tea Party Express.  Now 
20110126001341.000|20110126001343.000|TR0|she has invited in cameras.  And some see 
20110126001343.000|20110126001346.000|TR0|this as a little bit of a tug-of- war, 
20110126001346.000|20110126001348.000|TR0|little bit of a turf battle where the Tea 
20110126001348.000|20110126001351.000|TR0|Party Express still a bit suspicious of 
20110126001351.000|20110126001353.000|TR0|the Republican leadership of the 
20110126001353.000|20110126001356.000|TR0|Republican establishment.  Do you share 
20110126001356.000|20110126001358.000|TR0|that suspicion and do you worry at all 
20110126001358.000|20110126001400.000|TR0|that it sends a mixed message to the 
20110126001400.000|20110126001403.000|TR0|American people about sort of who speaks 
20110126001403.000|20110126001405.000|TR0|to the Republican Party?
20110126001405.000|20110126001408.000|TR0|
20110126001408.000|20110126001410.000|TR0|PENCE:  I'm not worried at all about a 
20110126001410.000|20110126001413.000|TR0|mixed message.  Paul Ryan is going do a 
20110126001413.000|20110126001415.000|TR0|terrific job tonight.  He is a principled 
20110126001415.000|20110126001417.000|TR0|conservative and is going to present a 
20110126001417.000|20110126001420.000|TR0|winning and positive and substantive 
20110126001420.000|20110126001422.000|TR0|message and Michele Bachmann I know will 
20110126001422.000|20110126001425.000|TR0|do the same thing and look, the more 
20110126001425.000|20110126001427.000|TR0|voices we have in the public debate that 
20110126001427.000|20110126001430.000|TR0|are calling for fiscal responsibility and 
20110126001430.000|20110126001432.000|TR0|reform and putting our nation back on a 
20110126001432.000|20110126001435.000|TR0|pathway to growth, the better.
20110126001435.000|20110126001437.000|TR0|
20110126001437.000|20110126001439.000|TR0|KING:  You could be in a leadership 
20110126001439.000|20110126001442.000|TR0|position in this Congress. You decided not 
20110126001442.000|20110126001444.000|TR0|to run for reelection of that position to 
20110126001444.000|20110126001447.000|TR0|give yourself a little time to think, a 
20110126001447.000|20110126001449.000|TR0|little freedom to speak on issues like 
20110126001449.000|20110126001452.000|TR0|this, but also to decide whether you want 
20110126001452.000|20110126001454.000|TR0|to run for president or maybe for governor 
20110126001454.000|20110126001457.000|TR0|of Indiana.  As you know, a number of 
20110126001457.000|20110126001459.000|TR0|conservatives have looked at some of the 
20110126001459.000|20110126001501.000|TR0|others thinking about running and they're 
20110126001501.000|20110126001504.000|TR0|not happy and they've started a "Draft 
20110126001504.000|20110126001506.000|TR0|Mike Pence" movement.  Can you tell us 
20110126001506.000|20110126001509.000|TR0|tonight are you going to run for president?
20110126001509.000|20110126001511.000|TR0|
20110126001511.000|20110126001514.000|TR0|PENCE:  Nice try, John.  Look, we're 
20110126001514.000|20110126001516.000|TR0|nearing the end of a process that began a 
20110126001516.000|20110126001518.000|TR0|couple of months ago and my little family 
20110126001518.000|20110126001521.000|TR0|and I are just trying to discern where we 
20110126001521.000|20110126001523.000|TR0|have the best opportunity to serve and to 
20110126001523.000|20110126001526.000|TR0|advance the conservative values that 
20110126001526.000|20110126001528.000|TR0|carried us into public life 10 years ago, 
20110126001528.000|20110126001531.000|TR0|but no decision tonight, but we'll keep 
20110126001531.000|20110126001533.000|TR0|you posted.
20110126001533.000|20110126001536.000|TR0|
20110126001536.000|20110126001538.000|TR0|KING:  You won't tell me whether you want 
20110126001538.000|20110126001540.000|TR0|to deliver a State of the State Address 
20110126001540.000|20110126001543.000|TR0|some night in Indianapolis or whether 
20110126001543.000|20110126001545.000|TR0|you'd like to give a State of the Union 
20110126001545.000|20110126001548.000|TR0|Address over there some night?
20110126001548.000|20110126001550.000|TR0|
20110126001550.000|20110126001553.000|TR0|PENCE:  I'll tell you some day.

20110126001555.000|20110126001557.000|TR0|KING:  What's the biggest decision maker 
20110126001557.000|20110126001600.000|TR0|for you?
20110126001600.000|20110126001602.000|TR0|
20110126001602.000|20110126001605.000|TR0|PENCE:  Well the biggest decision maker 
20110126001605.000|20110126001607.000|TR0|for us is really where we can make the 
20110126001607.000|20110126001610.000|TR0|most difference for the values that 
20110126001610.000|20110126001612.000|TR0|carried us to public life.  Look, you 
20110126001612.000|20110126001615.000|TR0|know, I was called into public service --
20110126001615.000|20110126001617.000|TR0|

20110126001622.000|20110126001624.000|TR0|KING:  -- hard for a House guy to win the 
20110126001624.000|20110126001627.000|TR0|presidency.
20110126001627.000|20110126001629.000|TR0|
20110126001629.000|20110126001632.000|TR0|PENCE:  I was called into public service 
20110126001632.000|20110126001634.000|TR0|to really stand for a set of principles.  
20110126001634.000|20110126001636.000|TR0|I've been very humbled by the 
20110126001636.000|20110126001639.000|TR0|encouragement we've received from people 
20110126001639.000|20110126001641.000|TR0|around Indiana and around the country to 
20110126001641.000|20110126001644.000|TR0|see some consistency in the way we've 
20110126001644.000|20110126001646.000|TR0|advocated the principles of limited 
20110126001646.000|20110126001649.000|TR0|government, fiscal responsibility, 
20110126001649.000|20110126001651.000|TR0|traditional values, and a strong defense.  
20110126001651.000|20110126001654.000|TR0|And what our little family is trying to 
20110126001654.000|20110126001656.000|TR0|discern with some help from some good 
20110126001656.000|20110126001658.000|TR0|counsel is where do we have the 
20110126001658.000|20110126001701.000|TR0|opportunity to really make a big 
20110126001701.000|20110126001703.000|TR0|difference for those values in the years 
20110126001703.000|20110126001706.000|TR0|ahead.

20110126001708.000|20110126001711.000|TR0|KING:  Congressman Pence, hope you'll stay 
20110126001711.000|20110126001713.000|TR0|in touch as you make that decision.  We're 
20110126001713.000|20110126001716.000|TR0|going to head to break now.  Congressman 
20110126001716.000|20110126001718.000|TR0|Pence may be running for president in the 
20110126001718.000|20110126001720.000|TR0|next cycle.
20110126001720.000|20110126001723.000|TR0|
20110126001723.000|20110126001725.000|TR0|When we come back, the man who was the 
20110126001725.000|20110126001728.000|TR0|president's opponent in the last election 
20110126001728.000|20110126001730.000|TR0|cycle, with divided government you have 
20110126001730.000|20110126001733.000|TR0|gridlock or compromise.  Senator John 
20110126001733.000|20110126001735.000|TR0|McCain joins us next to talk about what he 
20110126001735.000|20110126001737.000|TR0|sees around the corner.
20110126001737.000|20110126001740.000|TR0|

20110126001745.000|20110126001747.000|TR0|KING:  One of the big questions as we head 
20110126001747.000|20110126001750.000|TR0|from here into divided government is will 
20110126001750.000|20110126001752.000|TR0|there be compromise or (INAUDIBLE) 
20110126001752.000|20110126001755.000|TR0|gridlock.  One person who has voiced a 
20110126001755.000|20110126001757.000|TR0|willingness, a willingness to talk to the 
20110126001757.000|20110126001759.000|TR0|president, to cooperate with the president 
20110126001759.000|20110126001802.000|TR0|is the man who was his Republican opponent 
20110126001802.000|20110126001804.000|TR0|in the last election.  In a moment we'll 
20110126001804.000|20110126001807.000|TR0|introduce who John McCain will be sitting 
20110126001807.000|20110126001809.000|TR0|with tonight at the State of the Union.
20110126001809.000|20110126001812.000|TR0|
20110126001812.000|20110126001814.000|TR0|But let's start first with Senator McCain. 
20110126001814.000|20110126001816.000|TR0| And Senator McCain, let me start that if 
20110126001816.000|20110126001819.000|TR0|the -- if you're willing to reach out to 
20110126001819.000|20110126001821.000|TR0|the president and work with the president 
20110126001821.000|20110126001824.000|TR0|on some issues, when he says new 
20110126001824.000|20110126001826.000|TR0|investments tonight and that America has a 
20110126001826.000|20110126001829.000|TR0|sputnik moment and must make some new 
20110126001829.000|20110126001831.000|TR0|investments to be able to compete in the 
20110126001831.000|20110126001834.000|TR0|global economy, are you willing to say 
20110126001834.000|20110126001836.000|TR0|I'll work with you on that or is that just 
20110126001836.000|20110126001838.000|TR0|out of bounds until we get big spending 
20110126001838.000|20110126001841.000|TR0|cuts?
20110126001841.000|20110126001843.000|TR0|
20110126001843.000|20110126001846.000|TR0|SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA:  Well first 
20110126001846.000|20110126001848.000|TR0|of all, John, we have to cut the spending 
20110126001848.000|20110126001851.000|TR0|and that was the message of the election 
20110126001851.000|20110126001853.000|TR0|of November the 2nd and so that really has 
20110126001853.000|20110126001855.000|TR0|to be our first priority.  But if there 
20110126001855.000|20110126001858.000|TR0|are things that pure research and 
20110126001858.000|20110126001900.000|TR0|development that the federal government 
20110126001900.000|20110126001903.000|TR0|can do better than anyone else, that's how 
20110126001903.000|20110126001905.000|TR0|we got the Internet, then I would 
20110126001905.000|20110126001908.000|TR0|certainly support those.
20110126001908.000|20110126001910.000|TR0|
20110126001910.000|20110126001913.000|TR0|But if it's an increase -- just increases 
20110126001913.000|20110126001915.000|TR0|in spending like the stimulus package was, 
20110126001915.000|20110126001917.000|TR0|which, as you know, they promised eight 
20110126001917.000|20110126001920.000|TR0|percent unemployment, still 9.4 percent, 
20110126001920.000|20110126001922.000|TR0|that kind of thing can't be acceptable.  
20110126001922.000|20110126001925.000|TR0|By the way, I'm glad that he's going to 
20110126001925.000|20110126001927.000|TR0|call for a ban on earmarks.  I'm with him 
20110126001927.000|20110126001930.000|TR0|all the way on that.  In fact, I'd like to 
20110126001930.000|20110126001932.000|TR0|work with him on an enhanced rescission, 
20110126001932.000|20110126001934.000|TR0|which is sort of a constitutional version 
20110126001934.000|20110126001937.000|TR0|of a line item veto and so there are areas 
20110126001937.000|20110126001939.000|TR0|that I think we can work on.  I also would 
20110126001939.000|20110126001942.000|TR0|like to say we're very grateful that he's 
20110126001942.000|20110126001944.000|TR0|going to honor the families of the -- the 
20110126001944.000|20110126001947.000|TR0|victims of the tragedy in Tucson tonight.  
20110126001947.000|20110126001949.000|TR0|That means a lot to all of us all over the 
20110126001949.000|20110126001952.000|TR0|country, especially Arizona.
20110126001952.000|20110126001954.000|TR0|
20110126001954.000|20110126001956.000|TR0|KING:  Are there other issues?  Let's say, 
20110126001956.000|20110126001959.000|TR0|for example, I would expect the president 
20110126001959.000|20110126002001.000|TR0|tonight I'm told to say that maybe we can 
20110126002001.000|20110126002004.000|TR0|bring back the DREAM Act, which would help 
20110126002004.000|20110126002006.000|TR0|illegal immigrants who came into this 
20110126002006.000|20110126002009.000|TR0|country at a very young age, if they join 
20110126002009.000|20110126002011.000|TR0|the military, if they're on the college 
20110126002011.000|20110126002014.000|TR0|track, that they could be granted a path 
20110126002014.000|20110126002016.000|TR0|to citizenship.  You would not work with 
20110126002016.000|20110126002018.000|TR0|the president on that in the lame duck 
20110126002018.000|20110126002021.000|TR0|session.  The White House would very much 
20110126002021.000|20110126002023.000|TR0|like your help. Can they get it?       
20110126002023.000|20110126002026.000|TR0|MCCAIN:  If we secure the borders and we 
20110126002026.000|20110126002028.000|TR0|can secure the borders. We have not 
20110126002028.000|20110126002031.000|TR0|secured our borders.  If we don't have 
20110126002031.000|20110126002033.000|TR0|secure borders, John, then five, 10, 15 
20110126002033.000|20110126002035.000|TR0|years from now we're dealing with another 
20110126002035.000|20110126002038.000|TR0|group of young Americans who were brought 
20110126002038.000|20110126002040.000|TR0|here illegally by their parents.  So it's 
20110126002040.000|20110126002043.000|TR0|foolish to move forward with something 
20110126002043.000|20110126002045.000|TR0|like the DREAM Act until we get the 
20110126002045.000|20110126002048.000|TR0|borders secured and we can.  And with 
20110126002048.000|20110126002050.000|TR0|people and surveillance and with fences we 
20110126002050.000|20110126002053.000|TR0|can do it.  And by the way, as you know 
20110126002053.000|20110126002055.000|TR0|there's been a colossal failure and a 
20110126002055.000|20110126002057.000|TR0|waste of about $1 billion on a thing 
20110126002057.000|20110126002100.000|TR0|called SBI Net (ph) support -- secure 
20110126002100.000|20110126002102.000|TR0|border initiative.  It's disgraceful.
20110126002102.000|20110126002105.000|TR0|
20110126002105.000|20110126002107.000|TR0|KING:  It's an interesting night, Senator, 
20110126002107.000|20110126002110.000|TR0|as we wait to hear from the president.  
20110126002110.000|20110126002112.000|TR0|It's always a big night on Capitol Hill.  
20110126002112.000|20110126002114.000|TR0|What's interesting tonight is this post 
20110126002114.000|20110126002117.000|TR0|Tucson effort at civility and 
20110126002117.000|20110126002119.000|TR0|bipartisanship on the floor, so I'm going 
20110126002119.000|20110126002122.000|TR0|to let you have a unique role here and 
20110126002122.000|20110126002124.000|TR0|tell me as we introduce your date -- I'll 
20110126002124.000|20110126002127.000|TR0|use the term loosely -- tell me why, why 
20110126002127.000|20110126002129.000|TR0|and your date is sitting here with me, so 
20110126002129.000|20110126002132.000|TR0|be polite and then we'll bring him into 
20110126002132.000|20110126002134.000|TR0|the conversation.
20110126002134.000|20110126002136.000|TR0|
20110126002136.000|20110126002139.000|TR0|MCCAIN:  He's one of the nicest people 
20110126002139.000|20110126002141.000|TR0|that I have had the honor of knowing.  He 
20110126002141.000|20110126002144.000|TR0|and his cousin and his uncle was -- Morris 
20110126002144.000|20110126002146.000|TR0|Udall was one of the most decent men that 
20110126002146.000|20110126002149.000|TR0|ever graced the halls of Congress. And 
20110126002149.000|20110126002151.000|TR0|both Udall's are carrying on in that 
20110126002151.000|20110126002153.000|TR0|tradition of his father, Stewart Udall, 
20110126002153.000|20110126002156.000|TR0|who was a great secretary of the interior 
20110126002156.000|20110126002158.000|TR0|and both of them happened to have grown up 
20110126002158.000|20110126002201.000|TR0|in Arizona, as you know.
20110126002201.000|20110126002203.000|TR0|
20110126002203.000|20110126002206.000|TR0|KING:  Tom Udall is with me and how can we 
20110126002206.000|20110126002208.000|TR0|get more than just appearances tonight, 
20110126002208.000|20110126002211.000|TR0|pictures of bipartisanship.  On what 
20110126002211.000|20110126002213.000|TR0|issues can you maybe nudge, pull, prod 
20110126002213.000|20110126002215.000|TR0|your friend Senator McCain to say, look, 
20110126002215.000|20110126002218.000|TR0|you're maybe too far to the right for my 
20110126002218.000|20110126002220.000|TR0|view on this, but let's make common 
20110126002220.000|20110126002223.000|TR0|ground.  How can we come back in six 
20110126002223.000|20110126002225.000|TR0|months and say this wasn't just for show, 
20110126002225.000|20110126002228.000|TR0|it was actually for progress?
20110126002228.000|20110126002230.000|TR0|
20110126002230.000|20110126002232.000|TR0|SEN. TOM UDALL (D), NEW MEXICO:  Well, one 
20110126002232.000|20110126002235.000|TR0|of the most important things I think is 
20110126002235.000|20110126002237.000|TR0|the symbolism to start with because we 
20110126002237.000|20110126002240.000|TR0|haven't done this in a very long time.  
20110126002240.000|20110126002242.000|TR0|We've been divided and we've seen the 
20110126002242.000|20110126002245.000|TR0|State of the Union speeches, and what ends 
20110126002245.000|20110126002247.000|TR0|up happening at those speeches, if it's a 
20110126002247.000|20110126002250.000|TR0|Democratic president, frequently the 
20110126002250.000|20110126002252.000|TR0|Democrats are jumping up and down and the 
20110126002252.000|20110126002254.000|TR0|Republicans sit on their hands.
20110126002254.000|20110126002257.000|TR0|
20110126002257.000|20110126002259.000|TR0|And tonight we're going to be sitting with 
20110126002259.000|20110126002302.000|TR0|each other and sharing thoughts and 
20110126002302.000|20110126002304.000|TR0|conversation.  I'll never forget going to 
20110126002304.000|20110126002307.000|TR0|Iraq with Senator McCain.  He invited me 
20110126002307.000|20110126002309.000|TR0|on a codel with a couple of governors, a 
20110126002309.000|20110126002312.000|TR0|couple of House members and spending that 
20110126002312.000|20110126002314.000|TR0|time with him and being able to talk about 
20110126002314.000|20110126002316.000|TR0|the wars and where we were headed gives 
20110126002316.000|20110126002319.000|TR0|you an opportunity to find that common 
20110126002319.000|20110126002321.000|TR0|ground so that you can, in fact, work on 
20110126002321.000|20110126002324.000|TR0|ideas and move things forward.  So there 
20110126002324.000|20110126002326.000|TR0|are many things I think we're going to 
20110126002326.000|20110126002329.000|TR0|visit about tonight, and I hope six months 
20110126002329.000|20110126002331.000|TR0|from now we're really at the point where 
20110126002331.000|20110126002333.000|TR0|we can work together constructively on 
20110126002333.000|20110126002336.000|TR0|specific proposals.
20110126002336.000|20110126002338.000|TR0|
20110126002338.000|20110126002341.000|TR0|KING:  It is --
20110126002341.000|20110126002343.000|TR0|
20110126002343.000|20110126002346.000|TR0|UDALL:  And the DREAM Act would be one for 
20110126002346.000|20110126002348.000|TR0|me, John.  I know Senator McCain has been 
20110126002348.000|20110126002351.000|TR0|involved with that in the past and maybe 
20110126002351.000|20110126002353.000|TR0|there are some changes we could make to it 
20110126002353.000|20110126002355.000|TR0|and try to tweak that.       KING:  It is 
20110126002355.000|20110126002358.000|TR0|clear if you hear Senator McCain and 
20110126002358.000|20110126002400.000|TR0|Congressman Pence was with us earlier in 
20110126002400.000|20110126002403.000|TR0|the program, Republicans are very 
20110126002403.000|20110126002405.000|TR0|skeptical that the president's commitment 
20110126002405.000|20110126002408.000|TR0|to deficit reduction and spending cuts is 
20110126002408.000|20110126002410.000|TR0|genuine.  Many of them see it as a post 
20110126002410.000|20110126002412.000|TR0|election messaging shift.  They want to 
20110126002412.000|20110126002415.000|TR0|see the (INAUDIBLE) shift.  What do you 
20110126002415.000|20110126002417.000|TR0|need to hear from the president as a 
20110126002417.000|20110126002420.000|TR0|centrist Democrat that convinces you 
20110126002420.000|20110126002422.000|TR0|you'll be able to go home and say we have 
20110126002422.000|20110126002425.000|TR0|a different outlook now?
20110126002425.000|20110126002427.000|TR0|
20110126002427.000|20110126002430.000|TR0|UDALL:  Well I don't think that there's 
20110126002430.000|20110126002432.000|TR0|any doubt that the president coming out of 
20110126002432.000|20110126002434.000|TR0|the last election has a different message 
20110126002434.000|20110126002437.000|TR0|and he's trying to connect with the 
20110126002437.000|20110126002439.000|TR0|American people on jobs, on moving our 
20110126002439.000|20110126002442.000|TR0|economy forward, and I think it's a good 
20110126002442.000|20110126002444.000|TR0|word when you say investing, John.  When 
20110126002444.000|20110126002447.000|TR0|you talk about investing in America, 
20110126002447.000|20110126002449.000|TR0|investing in education, investing in 
20110126002449.000|20110126002451.000|TR0|energy research, we need to do those 
20110126002451.000|20110126002454.000|TR0|things.
20110126002454.000|20110126002456.000|TR0|
20110126002456.000|20110126002459.000|TR0|And there's got to be a way where we all 
20110126002459.000|20110126002501.000|TR0|look out for the country.  I think the 
20110126002501.000|20110126002504.000|TR0|thing that frustrates people is when they 
20110126002504.000|20110126002506.000|TR0|watch their television, see us on C-SPAN, 
20110126002506.000|20110126002509.000|TR0|we seem to always be arguing and they 
20110126002509.000|20110126002511.000|TR0|don't know the good things that are 
20110126002511.000|20110126002513.000|TR0|happening in the committee rooms and other 
20110126002513.000|20110126002516.000|TR0|places, some of these -- like that trip to 
20110126002516.000|20110126002518.000|TR0|Iraq I talked about with Senator McCain 
20110126002518.000|20110126002521.000|TR0|where we visit about things.  I remember 
20110126002521.000|20110126002523.000|TR0|Senator McCain we came back from Iraq and 
20110126002523.000|20110126002526.000|TR0|we issued a common statement.  We went to 
20110126002526.000|20110126002528.000|TR0|the White House together.  We briefed 
20110126002528.000|20110126002530.000|TR0|President Bush together.  It was -- I 
20110126002530.000|20110126002533.000|TR0|think he felt you know here are two 
20110126002533.000|20110126002535.000|TR0|different perspectives from people that 
20110126002535.000|20110126002538.000|TR0|went over there and he was interested in 
20110126002538.000|20110126002540.000|TR0|seeing that.
20110126002540.000|20110126002543.000|TR0|
20110126002543.000|20110126002545.000|TR0|KING:  Well Senator McCain, do you 
20110126002545.000|20110126002548.000|TR0|believe, as someone who has been through a 
20110126002548.000|20110126002550.000|TR0|presidential election, who knows that the 
20110126002550.000|20110126002552.000|TR0|next presidential election is already in 
20110126002552.000|20110126002555.000|TR0|the early stages upon us and that will 
20110126002555.000|20110126002557.000|TR0|intensify with every passing day here in 
20110126002557.000|20110126002600.000|TR0|Washington, can we have a temporary moment 
20110126002600.000|20110126002602.000|TR0|of adult conversations, not that there 
20110126002602.000|20110126002605.000|TR0|won't be big disagreements, but adult 
20110126002605.000|20110126002607.000|TR0|conversations about those differences.  
20110126002607.000|20110126002610.000|TR0|And as you answer that question, as you 
20110126002610.000|20110126002612.000|TR0|close, if you could just explain.
20110126002612.000|20110126002614.000|TR0|
20110126002614.000|20110126002617.000|TR0|You're wearing the black-and-white ribbon 
20110126002617.000|20110126002619.000|TR0|in honor of Congresswoman Giffords from 
20110126002619.000|20110126002622.000|TR0|your state.  She's a Democrat, of course, 
20110126002622.000|20110126002624.000|TR0|but (INAUDIBLE) an empty chair on the 
20110126002624.000|20110126002627.000|TR0|floor tonight, so first assess that.  Is 
20110126002627.000|20110126002629.000|TR0|there a window and then close with a 
20110126002629.000|20110126002631.000|TR0|reflection on the missing congresswoman 
20110126002631.000|20110126002634.000|TR0|tonight in the room.
20110126002634.000|20110126002636.000|TR0|
20110126002636.000|20110126002639.000|TR0|MCCAIN:  Well first of all I believe the 
20110126002639.000|20110126002641.000|TR0|situation compels us to try to find common 
20110126002641.000|20110126002644.000|TR0|ground and I do believe the president has 
20110126002644.000|20110126002646.000|TR0|learned from the results of the election 
20110126002646.000|20110126002649.000|TR0|last November and we should be moving 
20110126002649.000|20110126002651.000|TR0|forward.  But I also don't think we should 
20110126002651.000|20110126002653.000|TR0|lose our passion.  You know the most 
20110126002653.000|20110126002656.000|TR0|passionate guy I ever dealt with was Ted 
20110126002656.000|20110126002658.000|TR0|Kennedy, and it would be passionate and 
20110126002658.000|20110126002701.000|TR0|I've been nose to nose with him.  And as 
20110126002701.000|20110126002703.000|TR0|soon as it was over, he'd throw his arm 
20110126002703.000|20110126002706.000|TR0|around me and give a big laugh.
20110126002706.000|20110126002708.000|TR0|
20110126002708.000|20110126002710.000|TR0|So we don't want to lose our passion 
20110126002710.000|20110126002713.000|TR0|because things are tough. But as far as 
20110126002713.000|20110126002715.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords is concerned, she is 
20110126002715.000|20110126002718.000|TR0|making amazing, amazing progress.  We're 
20110126002718.000|20110126002720.000|TR0|so pleased.  She is -- she is, I believe, 
20110126002720.000|20110126002723.000|TR0|got a good chance of recovery from 
20110126002723.000|20110126002725.000|TR0|everything that I hear of.  Let's not 
20110126002725.000|20110126002728.000|TR0|forget the 9-year-old Christine Taylor 
20110126002728.000|20110126002730.000|TR0|Green, Judge Roll who covered another 
20110126002730.000|20110126002732.000|TR0|individual's body with his own and the 
20110126002732.000|20110126002735.000|TR0|others who were victims as well.  So we 
20110126002735.000|20110126002737.000|TR0|celebrate their courage, we honor their 
20110126002737.000|20110126002740.000|TR0|lives, and we pledge to do what we can to 
20110126002740.000|20110126002742.000|TR0|make them proud of us.
20110126002742.000|20110126002745.000|TR0|
20110126002745.000|20110126002747.000|TR0|KING:  Senator McCain, we appreciate your 
20110126002747.000|20110126002749.000|TR0|thoughts and especially that last little 
20110126002749.000|20110126002752.000|TR0|bit of tribute there tonight.  We'll touch 
20110126002752.000|20110126002754.000|TR0|base in the days ahead to see what you 
20110126002754.000|20110126002757.000|TR0|think of the speech (INAUDIBLE). Senator 
20110126002757.000|20110126002759.000|TR0|Udall, thanks for stopping in as well, you 
20110126002759.000|20110126002802.000|TR0|guys behave. (INAUDIBLE) we'll keep 
20110126002802.000|20110126002804.000|TR0|watching on that one.   When we come back 
20110126002804.000|20110126002807.000|TR0|the challenge for the president, 
20110126002807.000|20110126002809.000|TR0|Democrats, Republicans -- our contributors 
20110126002809.000|20110126002811.000|TR0|with us after a break.
20110126002811.000|20110126002814.000|TR0|
20110126002814.000|20110126002816.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110126002816.000|20110126002819.000|TR0|
20110126002819.000|20110126002821.000|TR0|KING:  "The Best Political Team on 
20110126002821.000|20110126002824.000|TR0|Television" with us throughout the night 
20110126002824.000|20110126002826.000|TR0|to assess the stakes for the president and 
20110126002826.000|20110126002828.000|TR0|his speech and of course the Republican 
20110126002828.000|20110126002831.000|TR0|responses.  Let's check in with several 
20110126002831.000|20110126002833.000|TR0|right now.  Erick Erickson from 
20110126002833.000|20110126002836.000|TR0|RedState.com with us, Democratic pollster 
20110126002836.000|20110126002838.000|TR0|Cornell Belcher, David Gergen, a veteran 
20110126002838.000|20110126002841.000|TR0|of four presidencies, and Paul Begala with 
20110126002841.000|20110126002843.000|TR0|us from D.C.
20110126002843.000|20110126002846.000|TR0|
20110126002846.000|20110126002848.000|TR0|David Gergen, I want to go to you first 
20110126002848.000|20110126002850.000|TR0|because you have been with the president 
20110126002850.000|20110126002853.000|TR0|as he puts the final touches on the State 
20110126002853.000|20110126002855.000|TR0|of the Union Address.  For this president, 
20110126002855.000|20110126002858.000|TR0|so soon after the shellacking what is 
20110126002858.000|20110126002900.000|TR0|challenge number one?
20110126002900.000|20110126002903.000|TR0|
20110126002903.000|20110126002905.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER: 
20110126002905.000|20110126002908.000|TR0| Well, I think, John, he's got a great 
20110126002908.000|20110126002910.000|TR0|opportunity tonight because the country 
20110126002910.000|20110126002912.000|TR0|sort of likes what it's been seeing of 
20110126002912.000|20110126002915.000|TR0|Barack Obama since the election.  People 
20110126002915.000|20110126002917.000|TR0|have been -- you know we have seen the 
20110126002917.000|20110126002920.000|TR0|polls go up pretty sharply, and so that 
20110126002920.000|20110126002922.000|TR0|gives him an opportunity for people are 
20110126002922.000|20110126002925.000|TR0|going to say, well maybe there's a new 
20110126002925.000|20110126002927.000|TR0|Barack Obama, not the guy we saw before 
20110126002927.000|20110126002929.000|TR0|the elections in last November, but this 
20110126002929.000|20110126002932.000|TR0|new Barack Obama.
20110126002932.000|20110126002934.000|TR0|
20110126002934.000|20110126002937.000|TR0|What is -- where's he trying to go with 
20110126002937.000|20110126002939.000|TR0|this presidency?  What's the major theme 
20110126002939.000|20110126002942.000|TR0|and emphasis?  And I think the real 
20110126002942.000|20110126002944.000|TR0|question tonight, can he change the 
20110126002944.000|20110126002947.000|TR0|conversation of the country to come to 
20110126002947.000|20110126002949.000|TR0|what he's calling this generation's 
20110126002949.000|20110126002951.000|TR0|sputnik moment.  And that is given the 
20110126002951.000|20110126002954.000|TR0|international global competition we face, 
20110126002954.000|20110126002956.000|TR0|the disappearance of American jobs, can we 
20110126002956.000|20110126002959.000|TR0|renew this economy and put -- make 
20110126002959.000|20110126003001.000|TR0|ourselves much more competitive.  And if 
20110126003001.000|20110126003004.000|TR0|he can bring the emphasis to that instead 
20110126003004.000|20110126003006.000|TR0|of us continuing to talk about all the 
20110126003006.000|20110126003008.000|TR0|things we've been talking about for the 
20110126003008.000|20110126003011.000|TR0|last two years, that would be -- that will 
20110126003011.000|20110126003013.000|TR0|be the beginnings of a political success.
20110126003013.000|20110126003016.000|TR0|
20110126003016.000|20110126003018.000|TR0|KING:  And Paul Begala, you are "A", a 
20110126003018.000|20110126003021.000|TR0|wordsmith and "B" you worked for a 
20110126003021.000|20110126003023.000|TR0|Democratic president.  The last Democratic 
20110126003023.000|20110126003026.000|TR0|president to face a midterm election very 
20110126003026.000|20110126003028.000|TR0|much like this one, to have Republicans 
20110126003028.000|20110126003030.000|TR0|seize power -- in Bill Clinton's case it 
20110126003030.000|20110126003033.000|TR0|was both the House and the Senate.  In 
20110126003033.000|20110126003035.000|TR0|terms of the repositioning of President 
20110126003035.000|20110126003038.000|TR0|Obama what do you think he needs to say 
20110126003038.000|20110126003040.000|TR0|most of all tonight?
20110126003040.000|20110126003043.000|TR0|
20110126003043.000|20110126003045.000|TR0|PAUL BEGALA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well 
20110126003045.000|20110126003047.000|TR0|I understand the sputnik moment, but it 
20110126003047.000|20110126003050.000|TR0|happened, as I recall from history, 1957.  
20110126003050.000|20110126003052.000|TR0|I'm an old man.  I wasn't even born then.  
20110126003052.000|20110126003055.000|TR0|Barack Obama was not even born then.  But 
20110126003055.000|20110126003057.000|TR0|if I can torture this sputnik metaphor, he 
20110126003057.000|20110126003100.000|TR0|needs to bring it back down to earth.
20110126003100.000|20110126003102.000|TR0|
20110126003102.000|20110126003105.000|TR0|OK in other words, he needs jobs, jobs, 
20110126003105.000|20110126003107.000|TR0|jobs.  And I'm all for competitiveness, 
20110126003107.000|20110126003109.000|TR0|whatever that is.  It is five syllables.  
20110126003109.000|20110126003112.000|TR0|We want jobs.  And this president has a 
20110126003112.000|20110126003114.000|TR0|wonderful opportunity.  I think he's got 
20110126003114.000|20110126003117.000|TR0|quite a good agenda frankly for jobs 
20110126003117.000|20110126003119.000|TR0|talking to some of his economic advisers.  
20110126003119.000|20110126003122.000|TR0|But rhetorically as a wordsmith, I would 
20110126003122.000|20110126003124.000|TR0|hack and close the site of thesaurus.com 
20110126003124.000|20110126003127.000|TR0|and just have these guys speak English or 
20110126003127.000|20110126003129.000|TR0|American English just for once.
20110126003129.000|20110126003131.000|TR0|
20110126003131.000|20110126003134.000|TR0|KING:  Erick Erickson, as the Republican 
20110126003134.000|20110126003136.000|TR0|in our group here, obviously the optics, 
20110126003136.000|20110126003139.000|TR0|we will see a Republican speaker over the 
20110126003139.000|20110126003141.000|TR0|president's shoulder.  We'll have two 
20110126003141.000|20110126003144.000|TR0|Republican responses after -- one the 
20110126003144.000|20110126003146.000|TR0|official response -- one a Tea Party 
20110126003146.000|20110126003148.000|TR0|response.  The president obviously can 
20110126003148.000|20110126003151.000|TR0|speak for an hour or so.  He has the grand 
20110126003151.000|20110126003153.000|TR0|stage.  He has the greatest opportunity to 
20110126003153.000|20110126003156.000|TR0|communicate with the American people. What 
20110126003156.000|20110126003158.000|TR0|do you see as the challenge for the right 
20110126003158.000|20110126003201.000|TR0|on this night?
20110126003201.000|20110126003203.000|TR0|
20110126003203.000|20110126003206.000|TR0|ERICK ERICKSON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well you 
20110126003206.000|20110126003208.000|TR0|know I'm not sure honestly that there is 
20110126003208.000|20110126003210.000|TR0|really a challenge for either side when 
20110126003210.000|20110126003213.000|TR0|you look at this thing historically and 
20110126003213.000|20110126003215.000|TR0|what it does to the polls.  No one outside 
20110126003215.000|20110126003218.000|TR0|a political junkie really ultimately pays 
20110126003218.000|20110126003220.000|TR0|attention.  The careful thing, though, for 
20110126003220.000|20110126003223.000|TR0|the Republicans are going to be there are 
20110126003223.000|20110126003225.000|TR0|a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill 
20110126003225.000|20110126003227.000|TR0|praying that Michele Bachmann makes Paul 
20110126003227.000|20110126003230.000|TR0|Ryan look like the very reasonable 
20110126003230.000|20110126003232.000|TR0|Republican.  If she uses the word 
20110126003232.000|20110126003235.000|TR0|"socialism" tonight it's game over.  
20110126003235.000|20110126003237.000|TR0|That's all we're going to talk about the 
20110126003237.000|20110126003240.000|TR0|rest of the week and that will be a big 
20110126003240.000|20110126003242.000|TR0|problem for the Republicans.
20110126003242.000|20110126003245.000|TR0|
20110126003245.000|20110126003247.000|TR0|KING:  Cornell, you're a Democratic 
20110126003247.000|20110126003249.000|TR0|pollster, but just help me broadly 
20110126003249.000|20110126003252.000|TR0|understand.  In public opinion we've seen 
20110126003252.000|20110126003254.000|TR0|the president come up among Independents 
20110126003254.000|20110126003257.000|TR0|since the election.  Obviously there's 
20110126003257.000|20110126003259.000|TR0|polarization in the rest of the 
20110126003259.000|20110126003302.000|TR0|electorate.  If this is an opportunity to 
20110126003302.000|20110126003304.000|TR0|make a new impression, obviously for the 
20110126003304.000|20110126003306.000|TR0|Republican House it's a first impression.  
20110126003306.000|20110126003309.000|TR0|For him to make a new impression, what is 
20110126003309.000|20110126003311.000|TR0|the most important part of the electorate 
20110126003311.000|20110126003314.000|TR0|the president needs to say tonight? Look 
20110126003314.000|20110126003316.000|TR0|we are going to have a tough year debating 
20110126003316.000|20110126003319.000|TR0|big issues.  Here is why I'm right.
20110126003319.000|20110126003321.000|TR0|
20110126003321.000|20110126003324.000|TR0|CORNELL BELCHER, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER:  By 
20110126003324.000|20110126003326.000|TR0|the way, Erick's my bi- partisan date for 
20110126003326.000|20110126003328.000|TR0|the night.
20110126003328.000|20110126003331.000|TR0|
20110126003331.000|20110126003333.000|TR0|ERICK ERICKSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  
20110126003333.000|20110126003336.000|TR0|Without the corsage.
20110126003336.000|20110126003338.000|TR0|
20110126003338.000|20110126003341.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110126003341.000|20110126003343.000|TR0|
20110126003343.000|20110126003345.000|TR0|BELCHER:  What I think, I think what 
20110126003345.000|20110126003348.000|TR0|you've been seeing him do is tact to the 
20110126003348.000|20110126003350.000|TR0|independent voters.  We have bounced up 14 
20110126003350.000|20110126003353.000|TR0|points among independents.  For better or 
20110126003353.000|20110126003355.000|TR0|worse, again, the independents, they want 
20110126003355.000|20110126003358.000|TR0|to see Democrats and Republicans working 
20110126003358.000|20110126003400.000|TR0|together.  Even though we know in our 
20110126003400.000|20110126003403.000|TR0|hearts, that isn't Washington they don't 
20110126003403.000|20110126003405.000|TR0|understand why it is.  He's going to 
20110126003405.000|20110126003407.000|TR0|continue to sort of move and sort of talk 
20110126003407.000|20110126003410.000|TR0|about Democrats coming together, talk 
20110126003410.000|20110126003412.000|TR0|about us getting bigger.  Again, going 
20110126003412.000|20110126003415.000|TR0|back to the theme, it's not a red state, 
20110126003415.000|20110126003417.000|TR0|it is not a blue state.  It's the United 
20110126003417.000|20110126003420.000|TR0|States.  I think you're going to see it 
20110126003420.000|20110126003422.000|TR0|very much in that vein, sort of pulling us 
20110126003422.000|20110126003425.000|TR0|together.  Uniting us and compelling us 
20110126003425.000|20110126003427.000|TR0|toward something bigger.
20110126003427.000|20110126003429.000|TR0|
20110126003429.000|20110126003432.000|TR0|KING:  David Gergen, in this Internet age, 
20110126003432.000|20110126003434.000|TR0|cable television age, Twitter and 
20110126003434.000|20110126003437.000|TR0|everything else, is the State of the Union 
20110126003437.000|20110126003439.000|TR0|as important as it once was?
20110126003439.000|20110126003442.000|TR0|
20110126003442.000|20110126003444.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  
20110126003444.000|20110126003446.000|TR0|That's a very good question and my 
20110126003446.000|20110126003449.000|TR0|tentative answer is no, but I think if a 
20110126003449.000|20110126003451.000|TR0|president really seizes that podium and 
20110126003451.000|20110126003454.000|TR0|can change it into something else, I think 
20110126003454.000|20110126003456.000|TR0|it could be.  It's too much a laundry 
20110126003456.000|20110126003459.000|TR0|list.  It's too familiar.  And, you know, 
20110126003459.000|20110126003501.000|TR0|all the cheering in the past, I hope this 
20110126003501.000|20110126003504.000|TR0|way, this form of seating, actually gets 
20110126003504.000|20110126003506.000|TR0|rid of some of the hyper-cheering that 
20110126003506.000|20110126003508.000|TR0|we've seen from one side versus the other. 
20110126003508.000|20110126003511.000|TR0| And then you can have a real conversation 
20110126003511.000|20110126003513.000|TR0|with the public, but the way it's been 
20110126003513.000|20110126003516.000|TR0|done in the last few years, John, it 
20110126003516.000|20110126003518.000|TR0|hasn't made that much of an impact, 
20110126003518.000|20110126003521.000|TR0|nothing like inaugural addresses.
20110126003521.000|20110126003523.000|TR0|
20110126003523.000|20110126003525.000|TR0|KING:  David, Paul, Erick and Cornell, 
20110126003525.000|20110126003528.000|TR0|will be with us throughout the night.
20110126003528.000|20110126003530.000|TR0|
20110126003530.000|20110126003533.000|TR0|To David's point, I was at a breakfast 
20110126003533.000|20110126003535.000|TR0|this morning with House Speaker John 
20110126003535.000|20110126003538.000|TR0|Boehner and he said he's always thought 
20110126003538.000|20110126003540.000|TR0|the up and down, up and down, and the 
20110126003540.000|20110126003543.000|TR0|stone silence was a bit too much and he 
20110126003543.000|20110126003545.000|TR0|hopes that changes not only for tonight 
20110126003545.000|20110126003547.000|TR0|but for the future.  We'll see how that 
20110126003547.000|20110126003550.000|TR0|plays out.  When we come back, a break 
20110126003550.000|20110126003552.000|TR0|from presidential focus of the president 
20110126003552.000|20110126003555.000|TR0|to a key Democrat who's on the ballot in 
20110126003555.000|20110126003557.000|TR0|2012 if-if he decides to run for 
20110126003557.000|20110126003600.000|TR0|reelection.  Jim Webb has been keeping his 
20110126003600.000|20110126003602.000|TR0|cards close to his vest.  We'll talk to 
20110126003602.000|20110126003604.000|TR0|Jim Webb when we return.
20110126003604.000|20110126003607.000|TR0|
20110126003607.000|20110126003609.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110126003609.000|20110126003612.000|TR0|
20110126003612.000|20110126003614.000|TR0|KING:  Welcome back to our special program 
20110126003614.000|20110126003617.000|TR0|tonight.  We live on Capitol Hill.  We are 
20110126003617.000|20110126003619.000|TR0|about 80 minutes away from the president's 
20110126003619.000|20110126003622.000|TR0|State of the Union Address, under the 
20110126003622.000|20110126003624.000|TR0|Capitol dome you see behind me.  The 
20110126003624.000|20110126003626.000|TR0|president's address tonight will help 
20110126003626.000|20110126003629.000|TR0|frame the big debates of 2011 and into the 
20110126003629.000|20110126003631.000|TR0|2012 election campaign.  The president 
20110126003631.000|20110126003634.000|TR0|will be up for re- election.  There will 
20110126003634.000|20110126003636.000|TR0|also be 20 Democrats in the Senate up for 
20110126003636.000|20110126003639.000|TR0|re- election that year.  And after seizing 
20110126003639.000|20110126003641.000|TR0|the House in 2010 the Republicans believe 
20110126003641.000|20110126003643.000|TR0|that because there are 20 Democrats on the 
20110126003643.000|20110126003646.000|TR0|ballot in 2012 they have the chance to 
20110126003646.000|20110126003648.000|TR0|take the Senate as well.
20110126003648.000|20110126003651.000|TR0|
20110126003651.000|20110126003653.000|TR0|One Democrat who has not yet said whether 
20110126003653.000|20110126003656.000|TR0|he will run for re- election is Senator 
20110126003656.000|20110126003658.000|TR0|Jim Webb, Democrat from Virginia.  He won 
20110126003658.000|20110126003701.000|TR0|in 2006, a good year for the Democrats, 
20110126003701.000|20110126003703.000|TR0|many think especially in Virginia 2012 
20110126003703.000|20110126003705.000|TR0|will not be as good a year for the 
20110126003705.000|20110126003708.000|TR0|Democrats.  So, will Senator Webb run for 
20110126003708.000|20110126003710.000|TR0|re-election or not?  We begin our 
20110126003710.000|20110126003713.000|TR0|conversation in his office earlier today, 
20110126003713.000|20110126003715.000|TR0|right there.
20110126003715.000|20110126003718.000|TR0|
20110126003718.000|20110126003720.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
20110126003720.000|20110126003723.000|TR0|
20110126003723.000|20110126003725.000|TR0|KING:  Senator, thank you for your time.
20110126003725.000|20110126003727.000|TR0|
20110126003727.000|20110126003730.000|TR0|I want to start with the big question 
20110126003730.000|20110126003732.000|TR0|people are asking.  That is, will you run 
20110126003732.000|20110126003735.000|TR0|for re-election?  Your rival from the last 
20110126003735.000|20110126003737.000|TR0|campaign, Senator Allen, announced he 
20110126003737.000|20110126003740.000|TR0|would like a comeback for this seat.  Will 
20110126003740.000|20110126003742.000|TR0|you be the Democratic candidate?
20110126003742.000|20110126003744.000|TR0|
20110126003744.000|20110126003747.000|TR0|SEN. JIM WEBB, (D) VIRGINIA:  We're still 
20110126003747.000|20110126003749.000|TR0|talking about that, particularly inside my 
20110126003749.000|20110126003752.000|TR0|family.  It's an eight-year commitment.  
20110126003752.000|20110126003754.000|TR0|People get excited about elections, but 
20110126003754.000|20110126003757.000|TR0|it's eight years.  So I've said that I'll 
20110126003757.000|20110126003759.000|TR0|make a decision before the end of the 
20110126003759.000|20110126003802.000|TR0|first quarter, and we will.      KING:  Is 
20110126003802.000|20110126003804.000|TR0|there some hesitation there?  If you look 
20110126003804.000|20110126003806.000|TR0|at your fund- raising, a lot of people 
20110126003806.000|20110126003809.000|TR0|would say -- especially, if you're gong to 
20110126003809.000|20110126003811.000|TR0|have a big high-profile race in 2012, 
20110126003811.000|20110126003814.000|TR0|you'd better start raising money.  You 
20110126003814.000|20110126003816.000|TR0|have delayed doing that.  I know it's not 
20110126003816.000|20110126003819.000|TR0|your favorite thing in the world.  Where's 
20110126003819.000|20110126003821.000|TR0|your head in the moment?  Leading in, 
20110126003821.000|20110126003823.000|TR0|leading out?
20110126003823.000|20110126003826.000|TR0|
20110126003826.000|20110126003828.000|TR0|WEBB:  I don't want to be out asking 
20110126003828.000|20110126003831.000|TR0|people for money unless they can be 
20110126003831.000|20110126003833.000|TR0|certain that I'm going to use it for a 
20110126003833.000|20110126003836.000|TR0|campaign.  When you go back to the '06 
20110126003836.000|20110126003838.000|TR0|campaign, I announced nine months almost 
20110126003838.000|20110126003841.000|TR0|to the day before the election with zero 
20110126003841.000|20110126003843.000|TR0|dollars and no campaign staff, and we were 
20110126003843.000|20110126003845.000|TR0|33 points behind, and we raised enough to 
20110126003845.000|20110126003848.000|TR0|win.  I don't want to go through that 
20110126003848.000|20110126003850.000|TR0|process again, but I'm not -- I'm not 
20110126003850.000|20110126003853.000|TR0|worried about the fundraising side.  This 
20110126003853.000|20110126003855.000|TR0|is much more a personal, family decision 
20110126003855.000|20110126003858.000|TR0|that we have to resolve.
20110126003858.000|20110126003900.000|TR0|
20110126003900.000|20110126003902.000|TR0|KING:  And as you know and I'm sure some 
20110126003902.000|20110126003905.000|TR0|of your advisers tell you, this is not 
20110126003905.000|20110126003907.000|TR0|'06.  It was a pretty good year for the 
20110126003907.000|20110126003910.000|TR0|Democrats, even in a state like Virginia, 
20110126003910.000|20110126003912.000|TR0|you won a very close race.  You were way 
20110126003912.000|20110126003915.000|TR0|behind.  People didn't think you had a 
20110126003915.000|20110126003917.000|TR0|chance.  But if you look at the climate 
20110126003917.000|20110126003920.000|TR0|now, a lot of people think 2012 will not 
20110126003920.000|20110126003922.000|TR0|be as favorable to Democrats and Virginia 
20110126003922.000|20110126003924.000|TR0|will not be as favorable to the Democrats. 
20110126003924.000|20110126003927.000|TR0|And they say, Senator, if you want to keep 
20110126003927.000|20110126003929.000|TR0|this seat, you have to get going.  How 
20110126003929.000|20110126003932.000|TR0|much pressure like that are you getting?
20110126003932.000|20110126003934.000|TR0|
20110126003934.000|20110126003937.000|TR0|WEBB:  A lot of people are giving me a lot 
20110126003937.000|20110126003939.000|TR0|of advice.  Again, I think what we've been 
20110126003939.000|20110126003941.000|TR0|able to do up here since I've come to the 
20110126003941.000|20110126003944.000|TR0|Senate speaks for itself.  We've been the 
20110126003944.000|20110126003946.000|TR0|principle voice up here for criminal 
20110126003946.000|20110126003949.000|TR0|justice reform.  I've got the 
20110126003949.000|20110126003951.000|TR0|subcommittees on the -- the two most 
20110126003951.000|20110126003954.000|TR0|important subcommittees, Armed Services 
20110126003954.000|20110126003956.000|TR0|and Foreign Relations. We've been the 
20110126003956.000|20110126003959.000|TR0|voice in terms of reengaging what East 
20110126003959.000|20110126004001.000|TR0|Asia and Southeast Asia.  We passed the GI 
20110126004001.000|20110126004003.000|TR0|bill.  We've done a lot of good work up 
20110126004003.000|20110126004006.000|TR0|here and I think people respond to that.
20110126004006.000|20110126004008.000|TR0|
20110126004008.000|20110126004011.000|TR0|KING:  Would you like a chance to run 
20110126004011.000|20110126004013.000|TR0|against George Allen again? He's not 
20110126004013.000|20110126004016.000|TR0|guaranteed the Republican nomination, of 
20110126004016.000|20110126004018.000|TR0|course, but would you like that?
20110126004018.000|20110126004021.000|TR0|
20110126004021.000|20110126004023.000|TR0|WEBB:  It's not in the formula.  It's 
20110126004023.000|20110126004025.000|TR0|whether or not we want to make the 
20110126004025.000|20110126004028.000|TR0|decision to be up here for another eight 
20110126004028.000|20110126004030.000|TR0|years and do what it takes to do that.
20110126004030.000|20110126004033.000|TR0|
20110126004033.000|20110126004035.000|TR0|KING:  I don't want to overly dwell on 
20110126004035.000|20110126004038.000|TR0|this but are you leaning one way or the 
20110126004038.000|20110126004040.000|TR0|other, 50/50?
20110126004040.000|20110126004042.000|TR0|
20110126004042.000|20110126004045.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20110126004045.000|20110126004047.000|TR0|
20110126004047.000|20110126004050.000|TR0|WEBB:  Again, we'll have a decision this 
20110126004050.000|20110126004052.000|TR0|quarter.
20110126004052.000|20110126004055.000|TR0|
20110126004055.000|20110126004057.000|TR0|KING:  Fair enough.
20110126004057.000|20110126004100.000|TR0|
20110126004100.000|20110126004102.000|TR0|Part of your decision, I assume is based 
20110126004102.000|20110126004104.000|TR0|on whether you think this is a productive 
20110126004104.000|20110126004107.000|TR0|enterprise.  The president has a big 
20110126004107.000|20110126004109.000|TR0|speech to the nation tonight at a time of 
20110126004109.000|20110126004112.000|TR0|divided government.  What do you need to 
20110126004112.000|20110126004114.000|TR0|hear from him?       WEBB:  I ran as a 
20110126004114.000|20110126004117.000|TR0|Democrat because I believe that the 
20110126004117.000|20110126004119.000|TR0|Democratic Party is the party that has 
20110126004119.000|20110126004121.000|TR0|historically taken care of working people. 
20110126004121.000|20110126004124.000|TR0|The party that has measured the health of 
20110126004124.000|20110126004126.000|TR0|society not at its apex, but at its base.  
20110126004126.000|20110126004129.000|TR0|The president, I think, finally hit that 
20110126004129.000|20110126004131.000|TR0|spot in the lame duck when he brought 
20110126004131.000|20110126004134.000|TR0|people together on the extension of the 
20110126004134.000|20110126004136.000|TR0|Bush tax cuts, but also the provisions in 
20110126004136.000|20110126004139.000|TR0|there that extended to unemployment, and 
20110126004139.000|20110126004141.000|TR0|gave business credits and those sorts of 
20110126004141.000|20110126004143.000|TR0|things.  I think you're going to hear 
20110126004143.000|20110126004146.000|TR0|tonight, hope you're going to hear that 
20110126004146.000|20110126004148.000|TR0|same sort of formula.  We've got to come 
20110126004148.000|20110126004151.000|TR0|together for the good of the country 
20110126004151.000|20110126004153.000|TR0|despite philosophical differences, and 
20110126004153.000|20110126004156.000|TR0|move things forward, number one.
20110126004156.000|20110126004158.000|TR0|
20110126004158.000|20110126004200.000|TR0|Number two, I personally will be looking 
20110126004200.000|20110126004203.000|TR0|at - in addition to that is this is not 
20110126004203.000|20110126004205.000|TR0|parliamentary system.  He is not the prime 
20110126004205.000|20110126004208.000|TR0|minister. So I'm not obligated agree with 
20110126004208.000|20110126004210.000|TR0|the president on every issue either, so 
20110126004210.000|20110126004213.000|TR0|I'll look very carefully at what he's 
20110126004213.000|20110126004215.000|TR0|proposed.  I hope to be able to agree with 
20110126004215.000|20110126004218.000|TR0|it but I don't feel obligated to.
20110126004218.000|20110126004220.000|TR0|
20110126004220.000|20110126004222.000|TR0|KING:  I was at a breakfast with the 
20110126004222.000|20110126004225.000|TR0|speaker this morning, the new Republican 
20110126004225.000|20110126004227.000|TR0|speaker at the House who said calling for 
20110126004227.000|20110126004230.000|TR0|more spending is not exactly a move to the 
20110126004230.000|20110126004232.000|TR0|middle.  We do expect the president to 
20110126004232.000|20110126004235.000|TR0|talk about some cuts and deficit 
20110126004235.000|20110126004237.000|TR0|reduction.  But also say that he believes 
20110126004237.000|20110126004239.000|TR0|there needs to be, he'll use the word 
20110126004239.000|20110126004242.000|TR0|"investment", but targeted new spending on 
20110126004242.000|20110126004244.000|TR0|things like infrastructure, research and 
20110126004244.000|20110126004247.000|TR0|development.  Good idea?  Or does the 
20110126004247.000|20110126004249.000|TR0|president need to have no new spending?
20110126004249.000|20110126004252.000|TR0|
20110126004252.000|20110126004254.000|TR0|WEBB:  Well, let's see what the proposals 
20110126004254.000|20110126004257.000|TR0|actually look like before we have the 
20110126004257.000|20110126004259.000|TR0|debate, but certainly there's room for 
20110126004259.000|20110126004301.000|TR0|cutting back in the federal budgetary 
20110126004301.000|20110126004304.000|TR0|process.  I was in the Pentagon when they 
20110126004304.000|20110126004306.000|TR0|announced the Gramm-Rudman cuts, which was 
20110126004306.000|20110126004309.000|TR0|a 5 percent reduction in the overall 
20110126004309.000|20110126004311.000|TR0|budget, which ended up being a 10 percent 
20110126004311.000|20110126004314.000|TR0|reduction in operating budgets because of 
20110126004314.000|20110126004316.000|TR0|entitlements and those sorts of things. 
20110126004316.000|20110126004319.000|TR0|There are places we can reduce federal 
20110126004319.000|20110126004321.000|TR0|spending.  At the same time we do need to 
20110126004321.000|20110126004323.000|TR0|get infrastructure programs going.  Look 
20110126004323.000|20110126004326.000|TR0|at China right now.  The money that they 
20110126004326.000|20110126004328.000|TR0|have been put in infrastructure is putting 
20110126004328.000|20110126004331.000|TR0|them in a difference place in terms of 
20110126004331.000|20110126004333.000|TR0|vibrance their economy.  So let's see how 
20110126004333.000|20110126004336.000|TR0|the president proposes that.  But doing 
20110126004336.000|20110126004338.000|TR0|that is a healthy thing for our country.
20110126004338.000|20110126004340.000|TR0|
20110126004340.000|20110126004343.000|TR0|KING:  The Senate will be, in my view, the 
20110126004343.000|20110126004345.000|TR0|most interesting place in town because you 
20110126004345.000|20110126004348.000|TR0|know the House Republicans, they can pass 
20110126004348.000|20110126004350.000|TR0|what they want to pass.  You have a 
20110126004350.000|20110126004353.000|TR0|Democratic president down the street who 
20110126004353.000|20110126004355.000|TR0|has to wait for Congress to act on these 
20110126004355.000|20110126004358.000|TR0|matters.  How do you see the role as the 
20110126004358.000|20110126004400.000|TR0|Senate, your role in particular as someone 
20110126004400.000|20110126004402.000|TR0|who wants to represent the middle in this 
20110126004402.000|20110126004405.000|TR0|time and in this uncertain time of divided 
20110126004405.000|20110126004407.000|TR0|government and a very narrow Democratic 
20110126004407.000|20110126004410.000|TR0|majority over here?
20110126004410.000|20110126004412.000|TR0|
20110126004412.000|20110126004415.000|TR0|WEBB:  I think it's going to be equally 
20110126004415.000|20110126004417.000|TR0|interesting in the House because we have a 
20110126004417.000|20110126004419.000|TR0|situation now where the Republicans who 
20110126004419.000|20110126004422.000|TR0|were elected in this last office have a 
20110126004422.000|20110126004424.000|TR0|certain on obligation to the people who 
20110126004424.000|20110126004427.000|TR0|elected them, some of whom may have 
20110126004427.000|20110126004429.000|TR0|unrealistic expectations but they're going 
20110126004429.000|20110126004432.000|TR0|to have to produce.  They are going to 
20110126004432.000|20110126004434.000|TR0|have to work with us.
20110126004434.000|20110126004437.000|TR0|
20110126004437.000|20110126004439.000|TR0|KING:  There are some conversations that 
20110126004439.000|20110126004441.000|TR0|are quite familiar post- Tucson to 
20110126004441.000|20110126004444.000|TR0|post-Virginia Tech, which, of course, 
20110126004444.000|20110126004446.000|TR0|happened in your state.  And people are 
20110126004446.000|20110126004449.000|TR0|saying, A, there are holes in the mental 
20110126004449.000|20110126004451.000|TR0|health system we need to deal with.  Some 
20110126004451.000|20110126004454.000|TR0|say there are holes in the gun control 
20110126004454.000|20110126004456.000|TR0|area to deal with.  You colleague Frank 
20110126004456.000|20110126004458.000|TR0|Lautenberg just today says he wants to 
20110126004458.000|20110126004501.000|TR0|propose going back to assault weapons bans 
20110126004501.000|20110126004503.000|TR0|style language, you can't buy those big 
20110126004503.000|20110126004506.000|TR0|magazine clips.  You can't buy a clip that 
20110126004506.000|20110126004508.000|TR0|you can put 30 bullets.  Good idea, or is 
20110126004508.000|20110126004511.000|TR0|that not the problem?
20110126004511.000|20110126004513.000|TR0|
20110126004513.000|20110126004516.000|TR0|WEBB:  I think that if you look at the 
20110126004516.000|20110126004518.000|TR0|public mood right now, we do have views on 
20110126004518.000|20110126004520.000|TR0|the extremes on those issues, but people 
20110126004520.000|20110126004523.000|TR0|want to be able to defend themselves.  
20110126004523.000|20110126004525.000|TR0|They want to be able to defend their homes 
20110126004525.000|20110126004528.000|TR0|and their families.  And that's my 
20110126004528.000|20110126004530.000|TR0|starting point on this issue.  The second 
20110126004530.000|20110126004533.000|TR0|one is if you look at Virginia Tech and if 
20110126004533.000|20110126004535.000|TR0|you look at the Tucson incident, the thing 
20110126004535.000|20110126004538.000|TR0|that these two people had in common, two 
20110126004538.000|20110126004540.000|TR0|things in common, they kill people, but 
20110126004540.000|20110126004542.000|TR0|the other thing is they are mentally ill.  
20110126004542.000|20110126004545.000|TR0|And we have had very lax laws with respect 
20110126004545.000|20110126004547.000|TR0|to how we deal with mental illness.
20110126004547.000|20110126004550.000|TR0|
20110126004550.000|20110126004552.000|TR0|There were clear signals in both of these. 
20110126004552.000|20110126004555.000|TR0| We dealt with this in detail when we 
20110126004555.000|20110126004557.000|TR0|examined the Virginia Tech situation, 
20110126004557.000|20110126004559.000|TR0|where this is a young man who had had 
20110126004559.000|20110126004602.000|TR0|clinical assistance over a period of time 
20110126004602.000|20110126004604.000|TR0|that was never communicated from one 
20110126004604.000|20110126004607.000|TR0|health provider to another when he was 
20110126004607.000|20110126004609.000|TR0|down at Virginia Tech.  So we need to make 
20110126004609.000|20110126004612.000|TR0|sure that those types of individuals get 
20110126004612.000|20110126004614.000|TR0|the care that they need, and don't have 
20110126004614.000|20110126004617.000|TR0|weapons.
20110126004617.000|20110126004619.000|TR0|
20110126004619.000|20110126004621.000|TR0|KING:  There's a lot of drama about 
20110126004621.000|20110126004624.000|TR0|tonight's speech, about this proposal, to 
20110126004624.000|20110126004626.000|TR0|have bipartisan seating.  Does Senator Jim 
20110126004626.000|20110126004629.000|TR0|Webb have a date, or do you think it's 
20110126004629.000|20110126004631.000|TR0|symbolic or is it silly, or what?
20110126004631.000|20110126004634.000|TR0|
20110126004634.000|20110126004636.000|TR0|WEBB:  It's a little silly, but it's not 
20110126004636.000|20110126004638.000|TR0|harmful.  I've got a lot of friends who 
20110126004638.000|20110126004641.000|TR0|are Republicans, and I don't quite see 
20110126004641.000|20110126004643.000|TR0|myself walking up to one of them and 
20110126004643.000|20110126004646.000|TR0|asking if they want to sit with me.  I 
20110126004646.000|20110126004648.000|TR0|have a favorite spot, which is fairly 
20110126004648.000|20110126004651.000|TR0|close to the door. I'll probably stay in 
20110126004651.000|20110126004653.000|TR0|that spot.
20110126004653.000|20110126004656.000|TR0|
20110126004656.000|20110126004658.000|TR0|KING:  Amen to that.  Let me close where I 
20110126004658.000|20110126004700.000|TR0|began.
20110126004700.000|20110126004703.000|TR0|
20110126004703.000|20110126004705.000|TR0|You were talking about why you ran as a 
20110126004705.000|20110126004708.000|TR0|Democrat and the values in the Democratic 
20110126004708.000|20110126004710.000|TR0|Party that are so important to you.  If 
20110126004710.000|20110126004713.000|TR0|you do decide to run again, is there any 
20110126004713.000|20110126004715.000|TR0|chance you would not run as a Democrat, 
20110126004715.000|20110126004717.000|TR0|that you would run as an independent, or 
20110126004717.000|20110126004720.000|TR0|if you run, would you run as a Democrat?
20110126004720.000|20110126004722.000|TR0|
20110126004722.000|20110126004725.000|TR0|WEBB:  I've been through a journey in my 
20110126004725.000|20110126004727.000|TR0|life on this.  Daniel Patrick Moynihan is 
20110126004727.000|20110126004730.000|TR0|probably my role model.  He was very 
20110126004730.000|20110126004732.000|TR0|comfortable serving in a Republican 
20110126004732.000|20110126004735.000|TR0|administration.  I am very proud to have 
20110126004735.000|20110126004737.000|TR0|served in the Reagan administration.  But 
20110126004737.000|20110126004739.000|TR0|in terms of the political values, when 
20110126004739.000|20110126004742.000|TR0|they are implemented properly, the 
20110126004742.000|20110126004744.000|TR0|Democratic Party is the party I identify 
20110126004744.000|20110126004747.000|TR0|with.
20110126004747.000|20110126004749.000|TR0|
20110126004749.000|20110126004752.000|TR0|KING:  We'll come back and check on that 
20110126004752.000|20110126004754.000|TR0|decision a little further down the 
20110126004754.000|20110126004756.000|TR0|quarter, I guess.
20110126004756.000|20110126004759.000|TR0|
20110126004759.000|20110126004801.000|TR0|WEBB:  Good.
20110126004801.000|20110126004804.000|TR0|
20110126004804.000|20110126004806.000|TR0|KING:  Senator, thanks for your time.      
20110126004806.000|20110126004809.000|TR0|WEBB:  Good to be with you.

20110126004833.000|20110126004836.000|TR0|coming in to get their seats, always a

20110126004941.000|20110126004944.000|TR0|Tea Party, these days.  It seems like, but 
20110126004944.000|20110126004946.000|TR0|Michele Bachmann has successfully sort of 
20110126004946.000|20110126004949.000|TR0|stolen know, it's always a big night for 
20110126004949.000|20110126004951.000|TR0|the Tea Party these days it seems like.  
20110126004951.000|20110126004954.000|TR0|But Michele Bachmann has successfully sort 
20110126004954.000|20110126004956.000|TR0|of stolen the show.  She has decided to 
20110126004956.000|20110126004958.000|TR0|give her own response to the State of the 
20110126004958.000|20110126005001.000|TR0|Union, and done so kind of on her own. She 
20110126005001.000|20110126005003.000|TR0|has put, you know, she has put maverick in 
20110126005003.000|20110126005006.000|TR0|upper case all of the sudden.  So she is a 
20110126005006.000|20110126005008.000|TR0|problem for the Republicans.
20110126005008.000|20110126005011.000|TR0|
20110126005011.000|20110126005013.000|TR0|KING:  You do see it as a problem?
20110126005013.000|20110126005015.000|TR0|
20110126005015.000|20110126005018.000|TR0|PARKER:  I do.
20110126005018.000|20110126005020.000|TR0|
20110126005020.000|20110126005023.000|TR0|KING:  Not just fun theater, not just 
20110126005023.000|20110126005025.000|TR0|awkward, but a problem?
20110126005025.000|20110126005028.000|TR0|
20110126005028.000|20110126005030.000|TR0|PARKER:  It's fun theater for us, but I 
20110126005030.000|20110126005033.000|TR0|think internally she is a challenge for 
20110126005033.000|20110126005035.000|TR0|them because she is, as I said, not only 
20110126005035.000|20110126005037.000|TR0|is she stealing the show, but she is 
20110126005037.000|20110126005040.000|TR0|positioning herself.  She didn't get 
20110126005040.000|20110126005042.000|TR0|anybody -- she didn't go and talk to John 
20110126005042.000|20110126005045.000|TR0|Boehner about doing this.  She is on her 
20110126005045.000|20110126005047.000|TR0|own.  She is very much going rogue, 
20110126005047.000|20110126005050.000|TR0|positioning herself possibly for a 
20110126005050.000|20110126005052.000|TR0|presidential run.  And you know, Michele 
20110126005052.000|20110126005054.000|TR0|Bachmann is -- she is a lightning rod.  
20110126005054.000|20110126005057.000|TR0|She is forcing the Boehner establishment 
20110126005057.000|20110126005059.000|TR0|part of the party to sort of reckon with 
20110126005059.000|20110126005102.000|TR0|the Tea Party in a different way.  It's 
20110126005102.000|20110126005104.000|TR0|making it awkward.
20110126005104.000|20110126005107.000|TR0|
20110126005107.000|20110126005109.000|TR0|KING:  That's an interesting point.  I was 
20110126005109.000|20110126005112.000|TR0|at a breakfast with the speaker this 
20110126005112.000|20110126005114.000|TR0|morning.  I know you're talking to him 
20110126005114.000|20110126005116.000|TR0|tomorrow. This is a management challenge 
20110126005116.000|20110126005119.000|TR0|for him.  He has all these new members. He 
20110126005119.000|20110126005121.000|TR0|has all this new energy, which is on the 
20110126005121.000|20110126005124.000|TR0|one hand is great.  Ideas, vitality, 
20110126005124.000|20110126005126.000|TR0|energy to a town that sometimes gets flat. 
20110126005126.000|20110126005129.000|TR0| But managing the expectations, and the 
20110126005129.000|20110126005131.000|TR0|verve, if you will of some of the Tea 
20110126005131.000|20110126005134.000|TR0|Party members, pretty tough.
20110126005134.000|20110126005136.000|TR0|
20110126005136.000|20110126005138.000|TR0|PARKER:  That was always a big problem.  
20110126005138.000|20110126005141.000|TR0|John Boehner, he recognized the power and 
20110126005141.000|20110126005143.000|TR0|the anger of the Tea Party.  He kind of 
20110126005143.000|20110126005146.000|TR0|rode that into town.  He was careful to 
20110126005146.000|20110126005148.000|TR0|manage them and respect them.  But now 
20110126005148.000|20110126005151.000|TR0|those that are in the Congress don't 
20110126005151.000|20110126005153.000|TR0|actually know John Boehner. He has to 
20110126005153.000|20110126005155.000|TR0|street them with a little bit gingerly.  
20110126005155.000|20110126005158.000|TR0|And yet, you know, they don't really quite 
20110126005158.000|20110126005200.000|TR0|know what they can expect from him.  So it 
20110126005200.000|20110126005203.000|TR0|is a management problem.
20110126005203.000|20110126005205.000|TR0|
20110126005205.000|20110126005208.000|TR0|He was careful in the very beginning to 
20110126005208.000|20110126005210.000|TR0|not raise expectations too high, as you 
20110126005210.000|20110126005213.000|TR0|say, because there is a limit to what the 
20110126005213.000|20110126005215.000|TR0|House can actually do.  And some of these 
20110126005215.000|20110126005217.000|TR0|newer members and some of the activists 
20110126005217.000|20110126005220.000|TR0|Tea Partiers out in the heartland, really 
20110126005220.000|20110126005222.000|TR0|weren't as knowledgeable as how things 
20110126005222.000|20110126005225.000|TR0|work here in Washington.  And so there is 
20110126005225.000|20110126005227.000|TR0|all of that.  You don't want to hurt 
20110126005227.000|20110126005230.000|TR0|anybody's feelings.  You don't want to 
20110126005230.000|20110126005232.000|TR0|insult anybody.
20110126005232.000|20110126005234.000|TR0|
20110126005234.000|20110126005237.000|TR0|KING:  You come up at things from the 
20110126005237.000|20110126005239.000|TR0|perspective right of center.  But what is 
20110126005239.000|20110126005242.000|TR0|the challenge for a Democratic president 
20110126005242.000|20110126005244.000|TR0|to in some ways he is trying to 
20110126005244.000|20110126005247.000|TR0|reintroduce himself to the American people 
20110126005247.000|20110126005249.000|TR0|after getting thumped pretty good in the 
20110126005249.000|20110126005252.000|TR0|election.
20110126005252.000|20110126005254.000|TR0|
20110126005254.000|20110126005256.000|TR0|PARKER:  He did get thumped.  But this is 
20110126005256.000|20110126005259.000|TR0|a great opportunity for the president and 
20110126005259.000|20110126005301.000|TR0|really in kind of an awful way.  Because 
20110126005301.000|20110126005304.000|TR0|we are at -- I hate to use the cliche, but 
20110126005304.000|20110126005306.000|TR0|we really are at a tipping point. The 
20110126005306.000|20110126005309.000|TR0|Tucson shootings were the moment I think 
20110126005309.000|20110126005311.000|TR0|that sort of forced us to say, you know, 
20110126005311.000|20110126005313.000|TR0|we've got to do something in this country 
20110126005313.000|20110126005316.000|TR0|to come together.  And he handled that 
20110126005316.000|20110126005318.000|TR0|speech very well.  He used a word out in 
20110126005318.000|20110126005321.000|TR0|Tucson that I'm  going to be listening for 
20110126005321.000|20110126005323.000|TR0|myself tonight.  And it's not Sputnik.  I 
20110126005323.000|20110126005326.000|TR0|know everybody is talking about the 
20110126005326.000|20110126005328.000|TR0|Sputnik moment. I'm done with that 
20110126005328.000|20110126005331.000|TR0|already.  Cliche, done.
20110126005331.000|20110126005333.000|TR0|
20110126005333.000|20110126005335.000|TR0|But he used a word that is kind of tricky 
20110126005335.000|20110126005338.000|TR0|for President Obama, which is 
20110126005338.000|20110126005340.000|TR0|"exceptional".  He called America 
20110126005340.000|20110126005343.000|TR0|"exceptional".  I think a lot of people 
20110126005343.000|20110126005345.000|TR0|out there in the heartland remember this 
20110126005345.000|20110126005348.000|TR0|speech.  We love to parse it.  We parse to 
20110126005348.000|20110126005350.000|TR0|within an inch of its life.  But to folks 
20110126005350.000|20110126005352.000|TR0|out there, the speech is not about words.  
20110126005352.000|20110126005355.000|TR0|It's not about Sputnik.  It's about an 
20110126005355.000|20110126005357.000|TR0|impression.  And the impression that the 
20110126005357.000|20110126005400.000|TR0|president could give tonight is that I am 
20110126005400.000|20110126005402.000|TR0|completely behind this country.  We are 
20110126005402.000|20110126005405.000|TR0|exceptional.  We are an exceptionalist 
20110126005405.000|20110126005407.000|TR0|nation. Because that's what most people 
20110126005407.000|20110126005410.000|TR0|actually do think.
20110126005410.000|20110126005412.000|TR0|
20110126005412.000|20110126005414.000|TR0|KING:  I think you can very much look for 
20110126005414.000|20110126005417.000|TR0|that language in the speech tonight from 
20110126005417.000|20110126005419.000|TR0|what I know of.  Kathleen Parker, good to 
20110126005419.000|20110126005422.000|TR0|see you in person.
20110126005422.000|20110126005424.000|TR0|
20110126005424.000|20110126005427.000|TR0|PARKER:  Good to see you, John.
20110126005427.000|20110126005429.000|TR0|
20110126005429.000|20110126005432.000|TR0|KING:  When we come back, a few 
20110126005432.000|20110126005434.000|TR0|last-minute details from our reporter from 
20110126005434.000|20110126005436.000|TR0|the White House and Capitol Hill as we 
20110126005436.000|20110126005439.000|TR0|ramp up, a little more than an hour away 
20110126005439.000|20110126005441.000|TR0|now from the president's State of the 
20110126005441.000|20110126005444.000|TR0|Union Address to the Congress and the 
20110126005444.000|20110126005446.000|TR0|American people.

20110126005449.000|20110126005451.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)     KING:  A little 
20110126005451.000|20110126005453.000|TR0|more than an hour away from the 
20110126005453.000|20110126005456.000|TR0|president's State of the Union address.  
20110126005456.000|20110126005458.000|TR0|Let's check in with our Senior White House 
20110126005458.000|20110126005501.000|TR0|Correspondent Ed Henry.
20110126005501.000|20110126005503.000|TR0|
20110126005503.000|20110126005506.000|TR0|Ed, is this president scribbling to the 
20110126005506.000|20110126005508.000|TR0|last minute, or is he ready?
20110126005508.000|20110126005511.000|TR0|
20110126005511.000|20110126005513.000|TR0|ED HENRY, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE 
20110126005513.000|20110126005515.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's interesting, 
20110126005515.000|20110126005518.000|TR0|John.  One thing I'll be looking for, for 
20110126005518.000|20110126005520.000|TR0|sure, is just how optimistic the president 
20110126005520.000|20110126005523.000|TR0|is.  What we're hearing from aides is that 
20110126005523.000|20110126005525.000|TR0|he is sort of going to be stealing a page 
20110126005525.000|20110126005528.000|TR0|from Ronald Reagan and showing kind of 
20110126005528.000|20110126005530.000|TR0|that sunny optimism, saying that there are 
20110126005530.000|20110126005532.000|TR0|big challenges, but we can rise to the 
20110126005532.000|20110126005535.000|TR0|occasion.  Also, how much is he going to 
20110126005535.000|20110126005537.000|TR0|steal a page from Bill Clinton, who had a 
20110126005537.000|20110126005540.000|TR0|similar kind of State of the Union in 
20110126005540.000|20110126005542.000|TR0|1995, where he had to pick up from the 
20110126005542.000|20110126005545.000|TR0|ashes of that election.  How much does he 
20110126005545.000|20110126005547.000|TR0|borrow from Bill Clinton?  We've been 
20110126005547.000|20110126005550.000|TR0|hearing about personnel moves, about 
20110126005550.000|20110126005552.000|TR0|policy moves that show he is borrowing the 
20110126005552.000|20110126005554.000|TR0|playbook.  How much does he sort of mirror 
20110126005554.000|20110126005557.000|TR0|that same message from Bill Clinton 
20110126005557.000|20110126005559.000|TR0|tonight will be something we'll watch as 
20110126005559.000|20110126005602.000|TR0|well.
20110126005602.000|20110126005604.000|TR0|
20110126005604.000|20110126005607.000|TR0|KING:  Ed Henry, thanks, just outside the 
20110126005607.000|20110126005609.000|TR0|House chamber in Statuary Hall our 
20110126005609.000|20110126005611.000|TR0|National Political Correspondent Jessica 
20110126005611.000|20110126005614.000|TR0|Yellin.
20110126005614.000|20110126005616.000|TR0|
20110126005616.000|20110126005619.000|TR0|Jess, not just the president facing 
20110126005619.000|20110126005621.000|TR0|challenges tonight but the Republicans as 
20110126005621.000|20110126005624.000|TR0|well.
20110126005624.000|20110126005626.000|TR0|
20110126005626.000|20110126005629.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN NAT. POLITICAL 
20110126005629.000|20110126005631.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, John.  We've 
20110126005631.000|20110126005633.000|TR0|made a lot about the fact that Michele 
20110126005633.000|20110126005636.000|TR0|Bachmann and Paul Ryan are both giving 
20110126005636.000|20110126005638.000|TR0|separate rebuttal comments after the State 
20110126005638.000|20110126005641.000|TR0|of the Union.  But that's much more of a 
20110126005641.000|20110126005643.000|TR0|one-night show.  The real challenge ahead 
20110126005643.000|20110126005646.000|TR0|for Republicans is will the Republican 
20110126005646.000|20110126005648.000|TR0|leadership and the new Tea Party 
20110126005648.000|20110126005650.000|TR0|activists, who have just been elected, 
20110126005650.000|20110126005653.000|TR0|agree on these spending cuts ahead?
20110126005653.000|20110126005655.000|TR0|
20110126005655.000|20110126005658.000|TR0|The president, he has a big challenge, but 
20110126005658.000|20110126005700.000|TR0|there seems to be clear signs of 
20110126005700.000|20110126005703.000|TR0|differences in the party, and they could 
20110126005703.000|20110126005705.000|TR0|have really troublesome clashes within 
20110126005705.000|20110126005708.000|TR0|their own ranks after tonight, something 
20110126005708.000|20110126005710.000|TR0|we'll no doubt be watching in the weeks 
20110126005710.000|20110126005712.000|TR0|ahead, John.
20110126005712.000|20110126005715.000|TR0|
20110126005715.000|20110126005717.000|TR0|KING:  Fascinating.  Jess, in a great 
20110126005717.000|20110126005720.000|TR0|position outside the House chamber.  
20110126005720.000|20110126005722.000|TR0|Joining me, right here, our Senior 
20110126005722.000|20110126005725.000|TR0|Political Analyst Gloria Borger.
20110126005725.000|20110126005727.000|TR0|
20110126005727.000|20110126005730.000|TR0|And as Jess notes, this is an early act 
20110126005730.000|20110126005732.000|TR0|that is sort of a chess game of divided 
20110126005732.000|20110126005734.000|TR0|government.
20110126005734.000|20110126005737.000|TR0|
20110126005737.000|20110126005739.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  
20110126005739.000|20110126005742.000|TR0|Sure.
20110126005742.000|20110126005744.000|TR0|
20110126005744.000|20110126005747.000|TR0|KING:  The president gets this great 
20110126005747.000|20110126005749.000|TR0|platform with the American people.  We 
20110126005749.000|20110126005751.000|TR0|don't know how this is going to end.  But 
20110126005751.000|20110126005754.000|TR0|it's an interesting beginning.
20110126005754.000|20110126005756.000|TR0|
20110126005756.000|20110126005759.000|TR0|BORGER:  We don't because the president is 
20110126005759.000|20110126005801.000|TR0|going the say look, we have to kick this 
20110126005801.000|20110126005804.000|TR0|up another gear here, or we're going to 
20110126005804.000|20110126005806.000|TR0|consign our children to a kind of future 
20110126005806.000|20110126005809.000|TR0|that we don't really want for them.  So 
20110126005809.000|20110126005811.000|TR0|you got to come along with me on the 
20110126005811.000|20110126005813.000|TR0|innovation.
20110126005813.000|20110126005816.000|TR0|
20110126005816.000|20110126005818.000|TR0|And Republicans are going to say, not so 
20110126005818.000|20110126005821.000|TR0|fast.  We have to talk about the here and 
20110126005821.000|20110126005823.000|TR0|now.  And we have to cut, or our children 
20110126005823.000|20110126005826.000|TR0|will not have a good future.  So it's 
20110126005826.000|20110126005828.000|TR0|really a theological argument, if you 
20110126005828.000|20110126005830.000|TR0|will, between Republicans and Democrats.  
20110126005830.000|20110126005833.000|TR0|And the president, the big question is, 
20110126005833.000|20110126005835.000|TR0|can they work this out?
20110126005835.000|20110126005838.000|TR0|
20110126005838.000|20110126005840.000|TR0|KING:  Can they work this out?  We won't 
20110126005840.000|20110126005843.000|TR0|know the answer for that for months.  One 
20110126005843.000|20110126005845.000|TR0|of the interesting things is the president 
20110126005845.000|20110126005848.000|TR0|is going to try to rally people with an 
20110126005848.000|20110126005850.000|TR0|optimistic speech saying I know you're in 
20110126005850.000|20110126005852.000|TR0|a funk.  I know we've had a few tough 
20110126005852.000|20110126005855.000|TR0|years, but we're starting to come out of 
20110126005855.000|20110126005857.000|TR0|it.
20110126005857.000|20110126005900.000|TR0|
20110126005900.000|20110126005902.000|TR0|BORGER:  Right, turning the corner.
20110126005902.000|20110126005905.000|TR0|
20110126005905.000|20110126005907.000|TR0|KING:  If we rally, we can compete with 
20110126005907.000|20110126005909.000|TR0|China.  We with compete with India, if you 
20110126005909.000|20110126005912.000|TR0|lift your heads up.  That is the 
20110126005912.000|20110126005914.000|TR0|president's big goal tonight.
20110126005914.000|20110126005917.000|TR0|
20110126005917.000|20110126005919.000|TR0|BORGER:  You talk about Ronald Reagan, 
20110126005919.000|20110126005922.000|TR0|morning in America. Restore America to its 
20110126005922.000|20110126005924.000|TR0|greatness.  That's what he is going to 
20110126005924.000|20110126005927.000|TR0|talk about.
20110126005927.000|20110126005929.000|TR0|
20110126005929.000|20110126005931.000|TR0|KING:  We will get an optimistic tone from 
20110126005931.000|20110126005934.000|TR0|our president tonight. We are about an 
20110126005934.000|20110126005936.000|TR0|hour away from the president's speech.  
20110126005936.000|20110126005939.000|TR0|And as CNN's continuing coverage of the 
20110126005939.000|20110126005941.000|TR0|president's State of the Union goes on, 
20110126005941.000|20110126005944.000|TR0|I'm joined by my colleague, Wolf Blitzer, 
20110126005944.000|20110126005946.000|TR0|in New York.
