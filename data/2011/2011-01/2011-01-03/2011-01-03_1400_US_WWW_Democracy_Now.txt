20110103141416.028|20110103141417.742|TR0|already we've seen a number of 
20110103141417.742|20110103141419.455|TR0|powerful Democrats indicate that 
20110103141419.455|20110103141421.168|TR0|they have real, real qualms 
20110103141421.168|20110103141422.881|TR0|about what the EPA is intending

20110103141436.587|20110103141438.300|TR0|called the Obama administration 
20110103141438.300|20110103141440.013|TR0|"one of the most corrupt

20110103141445.152|20110103141446.866|TR0|that this is one of the most 
20110103141446.866|20110103141448.579|TR0|corrupt administrations, which 
20110103141448.579|20110103141450.292|TR0|is what I meant to say there, 
20110103141450.292|20110103141452.005|TR0|when you hand out a trillion 
20110103141452.005|20110103141453.718|TR0|dollars in TARP just before this 
20110103141453.718|20110103141455.431|TR0|president came in, most of it 
20110103141455.431|20110103141457.145|TR0|unspent, a trillion dollars 
20110103141457.145|20110103141458.858|TR0|nearly in stimulus that this 
20110103141458.858|20110103141500.571|TR0|president asked for, plus this 
20110103141500.571|20110103141502.284|TR0|huge expansion in healthcare and 
20110103141502.284|20110103141503.997|TR0|government, it has a corrupting 
20110103141503.997|20110103141505.710|TR0|effect. When I look at waste, 
20110103141505.710|20110103141507.424|TR0|fraud and abuse in the 
20110103141507.424|20110103141509.137|TR0|bureaucracy and in the 
20110103141509.137|20110103141510.850|TR0|government, this is like 
20110103141510.850|20110103141512.563|TR0|steroids to pump up the muscles 
20110103141512.563|20110103141514.276|TR0|of waste.

20110103141531.408|20110103141533.121|TR0|Ryan, thanks for joining us by 
20110103141533.121|20110103141534.834|TR0|Democracy Now! video stream. Why 
20110103141534.834|20110103141536.548|TR0|don't you begin by laying out 
20110103141536.548|20110103141538.261|TR0|who the Republican leadership is 
20110103141538.261|20110103141539.974|TR0|in this new Congress that begins 
20110103141539.974|20110103141541.687|TR0|on Wednesday?
20110103141541.687|20110103141543.400|TR0|
20110103141543.400|20110103141545.113|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Sure. Well, two of 
20110103141545.113|20110103141546.827|TR0|the ones that you're going to 
20110103141546.827|20110103141548.540|TR0|hear the most from over the next 
20110103141548.540|20110103141550.253|TR0|two years are the two that you 
20110103141550.253|20110103141551.966|TR0|just mentioned. You've got Fred 
20110103141551.966|20110103141553.679|TR0|Upton, who's going to be running 
20110103141553.679|20110103141555.393|TR0|the Energy and Commerce 
20110103141555.393|20110103141557.106|TR0|Committee, which has broad 
20110103141557.106|20110103141558.819|TR0|authority, not only over the 
20110103141558.819|20110103141600.532|TR0|EPA, environment, energy, but 
20110103141600.532|20110103141602.245|TR0|also over healthcare. So, this 
20110103141602.245|20110103141603.958|TR0|week they're already talking 
20110103141603.958|20110103141605.672|TR0|about having a healthcare reform 
20110103141605.672|20110103141607.385|TR0|repeal vote, and you're going to 
20110103141607.385|20110103141609.098|TR0|see Fred Upton leading that. 
20110103141609.098|20110103141610.811|TR0|Now, in order to get the 
20110103141610.811|20110103141612.524|TR0|chairmanship of that committee, 
20110103141612.524|20110103141614.237|TR0|he had to push himself pretty 
20110103141614.237|20110103141615.951|TR0|far to the right, because he's 
20110103141615.951|20110103141617.664|TR0|what qualifies for a moderate in 
20110103141617.664|20110103141619.377|TR0|this House Republican 
20110103141619.377|20110103141621.090|TR0|Conference. So he's going to be 
20110103141621.090|20110103141622.803|TR0|pressured this entire two years 
20110103141622.803|20110103141624.516|TR0|to push as far to the right as 
20110103141624.516|20110103141626.230|TR0|he can.
20110103141626.230|20110103141627.943|TR0|
20110103141627.943|20110103141629.656|TR0|And the other one you're going 
20110103141629.656|20110103141631.369|TR0|to hear a lot from is Darrell 
20110103141631.369|20110103141633.082|TR0|Issa. Now, Issa is a different 
20110103141633.082|20110103141634.796|TR0|kind of partisan Republican than 
20110103141634.796|20110103141636.509|TR0|most of the other ones, and he's 
20110103141636.509|20110103141638.222|TR0|been thinking very deeply about 
20110103141638.222|20110103141639.935|TR0|how he's going to engage in 
20110103141639.935|20110103141641.648|TR0|oversight over these next two 
20110103141641.648|20110103141643.361|TR0|years. And so, you're going to - 
20110103141643.361|20110103141645.075|TR0|it's going to be very hard to 
20110103141645.075|20110103141646.788|TR0|pigeonhole him as a pure 
20110103141646.788|20110103141648.501|TR0|partisan, because he's going to 
20110103141648.501|20110103141650.214|TR0|go after a lot of issues where 
20110103141650.214|20110103141651.927|TR0|there will be support on both 
20110103141651.927|20110103141653.640|TR0|sides. For example, this morning 
20110103141653.640|20110103141655.354|TR0|there was a report that he's 
20110103141655.354|20110103141657.067|TR0|going to focus closely on 
20110103141657.067|20110103141658.780|TR0|corruption in Afghanistan. You 
20110103141658.780|20110103141700.493|TR0|know, that's something that 
20110103141700.493|20110103141702.206|TR0|everybody can agree ought to be 
20110103141702.206|20110103141703.919|TR0|looked at. So he's going to look 
20110103141703.919|20110103141705.633|TR0|at things that have broad 
20110103141705.633|20110103141707.346|TR0|popular support to be 
20110103141707.346|20110103141709.059|TR0|investigated, but also things 
20110103141709.059|20110103141710.772|TR0|that will be able to make the 
20110103141710.772|20110103141712.485|TR0|Obama administration look bad. 
20110103141712.485|20110103141714.199|TR0|So when he finds that sweet 
20110103141714.199|20110103141715.912|TR0|spot, that's really where he's 
20110103141715.912|20110103141717.625|TR0|going to press ahead.
20110103141717.625|20110103141719.338|TR0|
20110103141719.338|20110103141721.051|TR0|Now, on the Appropriations 
20110103141721.051|20110103141722.764|TR0|Committee, you've got this guy 
20110103141722.764|20110103141724.478|TR0|Hal Rogers who's going to be 
20110103141724.478|20110103141726.191|TR0|running the show. And Hal 
20110103141726.191|20110103141727.904|TR0|Rogers, he kind of personifies 
20110103141727.904|20110103141729.617|TR0|the entire House Republican 
20110103141729.617|20110103141731.330|TR0|problem that they have. He's 
20110103141731.330|20110103141733.043|TR0|been in there for 30 years. He's 
20110103141733.043|20110103141734.757|TR0|known as the, quote, "prince of 
20110103141734.757|20110103141736.470|TR0|pork." And he's somebody that is 
20110103141736.470|20110103141738.183|TR0|going to be very tough - it's 
20110103141738.183|20110103141739.896|TR0|going to be very tough for him 
20110103141739.896|20110103141741.609|TR0|to fit in this hole that the Tea 
20110103141741.609|20110103141743.322|TR0|Party has dug for the 
20110103141743.322|20110103141745.036|TR0|Republicans and become this 
20110103141745.036|20110103141746.749|TR0|spendthrift. Now, the Tea Party 
20110103141746.749|20110103141748.462|TR0|is demanding $100 billion - 
20110103141748.462|20110103141750.175|TR0|that's with a "B," $100 billion  
20110103141750.175|20110103141751.888|TR0|--  in cuts for this fiscal 
20110103141751.888|20110103141753.602|TR0|year. Now, by March, when they 
20110103141753.602|20110103141755.315|TR0|have to put this budget forward, 
20110103141755.315|20110103141757.028|TR0|we'll already be halfway through 
20110103141757.028|20110103141758.741|TR0|the fiscal year. That means they 
20110103141758.741|20110103141800.454|TR0|have to cut $100 billion out of 
20110103141800.454|20110103141802.167|TR0|roughly $300 billion. So you'd 
20110103141802.167|20110103141803.881|TR0|have to cut discretionary 
20110103141803.881|20110103141805.594|TR0|spending by a full third just to 
20110103141805.594|20110103141807.307|TR0|satisfy the Tea Party, because 
20110103141807.307|20110103141809.020|TR0|discretionary domestic spending 
20110103141809.020|20110103141810.733|TR0|is really only about $550-$600 
20110103141810.733|20110103141812.446|TR0|billion a year. So that's going 
20110103141812.446|20110103141814.160|TR0|to be an incredible problem for 
20110103141814.160|20110103141815.873|TR0|Boehner and for the Republicans 
20110103141815.873|20110103141817.586|TR0|to hold this coalition together, 
20110103141817.586|20110103141819.299|TR0|when they've set such 
20110103141819.299|20110103141821.012|TR0|unrealistic expectations.

20110103141822.725|20110103141824.439|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Darrell Issa has 
20110103141824.439|20110103141826.152|TR0|said he is going to investigate, 
20110103141826.152|20110103141827.865|TR0|what - conduct some 500 
20110103141827.865|20110103141829.578|TR0|investigations over the next

20110103141834.718|20110103141836.431|TR0|interesting to see how he does 
20110103141836.431|20110103141838.144|TR0|that. The knock on Darrell Issa 
20110103141838.144|20110103141839.857|TR0|has always been that he begins 
20110103141839.857|20110103141841.570|TR0|an investigation, sends out a 
20110103141841.570|20110103141843.284|TR0|letter or two, then sends out a 
20110103141843.284|20110103141844.997|TR0|press release, he gets a couple 
20110103141844.997|20110103141846.710|TR0|stories written about it, and 
20110103141846.710|20110103141848.423|TR0|then he moves on to the next 
20110103141848.423|20110103141850.136|TR0|thing. That's something that is 
20110103141850.136|20110103141851.849|TR0|extremely effective in the 
20110103141851.849|20110103141853.563|TR0|minority, and he did it very 
20110103141853.563|20110103141855.276|TR0|well over the last two years. 
20110103141855.276|20110103141856.989|TR0|You can just go back through the 
20110103141856.989|20110103141858.702|TR0|number of stories that he was 
20110103141858.702|20110103141900.415|TR0|able to generate from just 
20110103141900.415|20110103141902.128|TR0|saying that he was launching an 
20110103141902.128|20110103141903.842|TR0|investigation. And so, it's easy 
20110103141903.842|20110103141905.555|TR0|to launch an investigation. All 
20110103141905.555|20110103141907.268|TR0|that requires is, you know, 
20110103141907.268|20110103141908.981|TR0|calling a press conference or 
20110103141908.981|20110103141910.694|TR0|putting out a press release 
20110103141910.694|20110103141912.408|TR0|saying, "I'm going to look into 
20110103141912.408|20110103141914.121|TR0|this." Now, actually doing the 
20110103141914.121|20110103141915.834|TR0|investigation takes a lot of 
20110103141915.834|20110103141917.547|TR0|time. So, the question of what 
20110103141917.547|20110103141919.260|TR0|he actually follows through on 
20110103141919.260|20110103141920.973|TR0|is something that we'll be 
20110103141920.973|20110103141922.687|TR0|watching. Five hundred - it just 
20110103141922.687|20110103141924.400|TR0|doesn't seem like he would have 
20110103141924.400|20110103141926.113|TR0|the manpower for that.

20110103141927.826|20110103141929.539|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Earlier this 
20110103141929.539|20110103141931.252|TR0|month, the incoming chair of the 
20110103141931.252|20110103141932.966|TR0|House Homeland Security 
20110103141932.966|20110103141934.679|TR0|Committee, Peter King, appeared 
20110103141934.679|20110103141936.392|TR0|on Fox News to discuss his vow 
20110103141936.392|20110103141938.105|TR0|to hold hearings on the 
20110103141938.105|20110103141939.818|TR0|radicalization of American 
20110103141939.818|20110103141941.531|TR0|Muslims. This is what he said.
20110103141941.531|20110103141943.245|TR0|
20110103141943.245|20110103141944.958|TR0|>> REP. PETER KING: Fact is, no 
20110103141944.958|20110103141946.671|TR0|one had a closer relationship 
20110103141946.671|20110103141948.384|TR0|with the Muslim community than I 
20110103141948.384|20110103141950.097|TR0|did before September 11th. Since 
20110103141950.097|20110103141951.811|TR0|then, I've been disappointed 
20110103141951.811|20110103141953.524|TR0|over the number of their leaders 
20110103141953.524|20110103141955.237|TR0|who do not cooperate with law 
20110103141955.237|20110103141956.950|TR0|enforcement. There are actual 
20110103141956.950|20110103141958.663|TR0|cases in this country where the 
20110103141958.663|20110103142000.376|TR0|imams direct their members not 
20110103142000.376|20110103142002.090|TR0|to cooperate with law 
20110103142002.090|20110103142003.803|TR0|enforcement on very serious 
20110103142003.803|20110103142005.516|TR0|investigations. And when you 
20110103142005.516|20110103142007.229|TR0|talk to law enforcement people 
20110103142007.229|20110103142008.942|TR0|around the country, including 
20110103142008.942|20110103142010.655|TR0|this area here, they will say 
20110103142010.655|20110103142012.369|TR0|they do not get the level of 
20110103142012.369|20110103142014.082|TR0|support that we need. Now, the 
20110103142014.082|20110103142015.795|TR0|overwhelming majority of Muslims 
20110103142015.795|20110103142017.508|TR0|are good people. For whatever 
20110103142017.508|20110103142019.221|TR0|reason, people in their 
20110103142019.221|20110103142020.934|TR0|leadership are not cooperative. 
20110103142020.934|20110103142022.648|TR0|And I believe it's important to 
20110103142022.648|20110103142024.361|TR0|have this investigation on 
20110103142024.361|20110103142026.074|TR0|radicalization of the Muslim 
20110103142026.074|20110103142027.787|TR0|community. We've seen what 
20110103142027.787|20110103142029.500|TR0|happened in England. We know 
20110103142029.500|20110103142031.214|TR0|that al-Qaeda is trying to 
20110103142031.214|20110103142032.927|TR0|recruit people over here, such 
20110103142032.927|20110103142034.640|TR0|as they did with the subway 
20110103142034.640|20110103142036.353|TR0|bombing in New York last year, 
20110103142036.353|20110103142038.066|TR0|the attempted subway bombing, 
20110103142038.066|20110103142039.779|TR0|Times Square bombing. These are 
20110103142039.779|20110103142041.493|TR0|all people living legally in the 
20110103142041.493|20110103142043.206|TR0|United States.

20110103142046.632|20110103142048.345|TR0|Congressmember Peter King. Ryan 
20110103142048.345|20110103142050.058|TR0|Grim?
20110103142050.058|20110103142051.772|TR0|
20110103142051.772|20110103142053.485|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Well, you know, 
20110103142053.485|20110103142055.198|TR0|Amy, as a New Yorker, you know 
20110103142055.198|20110103142056.911|TR0|Pete King extremely well, I'm 
20110103142056.911|20110103142058.624|TR0|sure. He's one of the most 
20110103142058.624|20110103142100.337|TR0|radical Republicans in the House 
20110103142100.337|20110103142102.051|TR0|when it comes to, you know, his 
20110103142102.051|20110103142103.764|TR0|views on Muslims and the war on 
20110103142103.764|20110103142105.477|TR0|terror. And that's really saying 
20110103142105.477|20110103142107.190|TR0|something, although we don't yet 
20110103142107.190|20110103142108.903|TR0|know where some of these 80-plus 
20110103142108.903|20110103142110.617|TR0|Republicans stand who are now in 
20110103142110.617|20110103142112.330|TR0|the freshman class. We're going 
20110103142112.330|20110103142114.043|TR0|to - I'm sure we're going to 
20110103142114.043|20110103142115.756|TR0|find a lot of interesting 
20110103142115.756|20110103142117.469|TR0|characters over the next two 
20110103142117.469|20110103142119.182|TR0|years. But having him as the 
20110103142119.182|20110103142120.896|TR0|head of this committee really 
20110103142120.896|20110103142122.609|TR0|does signal just a monumental 
20110103142122.609|20110103142124.322|TR0|shift to the right on Homeland 
20110103142124.322|20110103142126.035|TR0|Security policy and on the 
20110103142126.035|20110103142127.748|TR0|relationship to Muslims in 
20110103142127.748|20110103142129.461|TR0|America. It's just kind of a 
20110103142129.461|20110103142131.175|TR0|staggering thing to watch.
20110103142131.175|20110103142132.888|TR0|
20110103142132.888|20110103142134.601|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Let's turn to 
20110103142134.601|20110103142136.314|TR0|John Shimkus of Illinois. He's 
20110103142136.314|20110103142138.027|TR0|the new chair of the 
20110103142138.027|20110103142139.740|TR0|Subcommittee on Environment and 
20110103142139.740|20110103142141.454|TR0|Economy. In a March 2009 
20110103142141.454|20110103142143.167|TR0|hearing, Shimkus dismissed the 
20110103142143.167|20110103142144.880|TR0|existence of global warming by 
20110103142144.880|20110103142146.593|TR0|citing biblical scripture that 
20110103142146.593|20110103142148.306|TR0|says God would not allow the 
20110103142148.306|20110103142150.020|TR0|earth to be destroyed.
20110103142150.020|20110103142151.733|TR0|
20110103142151.733|20110103142153.446|TR0|>> REP. JOHN SHIMKUS: So I want 
20110103142153.446|20110103142155.159|TR0|to start with Genesis 8, verse 
20110103142155.159|20110103142156.872|TR0|21 and 22. "Never again will I 
20110103142156.872|20110103142158.585|TR0|curse the ground because of man, 
20110103142158.585|20110103142200.299|TR0|even though every inclination of 
20110103142200.299|20110103142202.012|TR0|his heart is evil from 
20110103142202.012|20110103142203.725|TR0|childhood. And never again will 
20110103142203.725|20110103142205.438|TR0|I destroy all living creatures, 
20110103142205.438|20110103142207.151|TR0|as I have done. As long as the 
20110103142207.151|20110103142208.864|TR0|earth endures, seedtime and 
20110103142208.864|20110103142210.578|TR0|harvest, cold and heat, summer 
20110103142210.578|20110103142212.291|TR0|and winter, day and night will 
20110103142212.291|20110103142214.004|TR0|never cease." I believe that's 
20110103142214.004|20110103142215.717|TR0|the infallible word of God, and 
20110103142215.717|20110103142217.430|TR0|that's the way it's going to be 
20110103142217.430|20110103142219.143|TR0|for His creation.
20110103142219.143|20110103142220.857|TR0|
20110103142220.857|20110103142222.570|TR0|The second verse comes from 
20110103142222.570|20110103142224.283|TR0|Matthew 24. "And He will send 
20110103142224.283|20110103142225.996|TR0|His angels with a loud trumpet 
20110103142225.996|20110103142227.709|TR0|call, and they will gather His 
20110103142227.709|20110103142229.423|TR0|elect from the four winds, from 
20110103142229.423|20110103142231.136|TR0|one end of the heavens to the 
20110103142231.136|20110103142232.849|TR0|other." The earth will end only 
20110103142232.849|20110103142234.562|TR0|when God declares its time to be 
20110103142234.562|20110103142236.275|TR0|over. Man will not destroy this 
20110103142236.275|20110103142237.988|TR0|earth. This earth will not be 
20110103142237.988|20110103142239.702|TR0|destroyed by a flood. And I 
20110103142239.702|20110103142241.415|TR0|appreciate having panelists here 
20110103142241.415|20110103142243.128|TR0|who are men of faith, and we can 
20110103142243.128|20110103142244.841|TR0|get into the theological 
20110103142244.841|20110103142246.554|TR0|discourse of that position, but 
20110103142246.554|20110103142248.267|TR0|I do believe God's word is 
20110103142248.267|20110103142249.981|TR0|infallible, unchanging, perfect.
20110103142249.981|20110103142251.694|TR0|
20110103142251.694|20110103142253.407|TR0|Today we have about 388 parts 
20110103142253.407|20110103142255.120|TR0|per million in the atmosphere. I 
20110103142255.120|20110103142256.833|TR0|think in the age of the 
20110103142256.833|20110103142258.546|TR0|dinosaurs, where we had most 
20110103142258.546|20110103142300.260|TR0|flora and fauna, we were 
20110103142300.260|20110103142301.973|TR0|probably at 4,000 parts per 
20110103142301.973|20110103142303.686|TR0|million. There is a theological 
20110103142303.686|20110103142305.399|TR0|debate that this is a 
20110103142305.399|20110103142307.112|TR0|carbon-starved planet - not too 
20110103142307.112|20110103142308.826|TR0|much carbon.

20110103142310.539|20110103142312.252|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That's the 
20110103142312.252|20110103142313.965|TR0|Illinois Republican Congress 
20110103142313.965|20110103142315.678|TR0|member John Shimkus, the new 
20110103142315.678|20110103142317.391|TR0|chair of the Subcommittee on 
20110103142317.391|20110103142319.105|TR0|Environment and Economy. Ryan 
20110103142319.105|20110103142320.818|TR0|Grim?
20110103142320.818|20110103142322.531|TR0|
20110103142322.531|20110103142324.244|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Yeah, and what's 
20110103142324.244|20110103142325.957|TR0|really remarkable about that 
20110103142325.957|20110103142327.670|TR0|clip that you just played is 
20110103142327.670|20110103142329.384|TR0|that it wasn't something that 
20110103142329.384|20110103142331.097|TR0|was, you know, surreptitiously 
20110103142331.097|20110103142332.810|TR0|recorded at some obscure 
20110103142332.810|20110103142334.523|TR0|Christian conference where he 
20110103142334.523|20110103142336.236|TR0|thought he was speaking just to 
20110103142336.236|20110103142337.949|TR0|the faithful. That comes from a 
20110103142337.949|20110103142339.663|TR0|congressional hearing, where you 
20110103142339.663|20110103142341.376|TR0|have scientists that come before 
20110103142341.376|20110103142343.089|TR0|the panel in order to talk about 
20110103142343.089|20110103142344.802|TR0|the dangers of climate change. 
20110103142344.802|20110103142346.515|TR0|And that's his response. And 
20110103142346.515|20110103142348.229|TR0|that's one of this scariest 
20110103142348.229|20110103142349.942|TR0|things about the takeover of 
20110103142349.942|20110103142351.655|TR0|this committee, is because there 
20110103142351.655|20110103142353.368|TR0|isn't a lot of time to reverse 
20110103142353.368|20110103142355.081|TR0|climate change. As he said, the 
20110103142355.081|20110103142356.794|TR0|carbon concentration is 
20110103142356.794|20110103142358.508|TR0|approaching 400 parts per 
20110103142358.508|20110103142400.221|TR0|million. It's probably gone 
20110103142400.221|20110103142401.934|TR0|beyond, according to most 
20110103142401.934|20110103142403.647|TR0|scientists, the threshold by 
20110103142403.647|20110103142405.360|TR0|which there start being these 
20110103142405.360|20110103142407.073|TR0|feedback mechanisms that just 
20110103142407.073|20110103142408.787|TR0|send climate change over a 
20110103142408.787|20110103142410.500|TR0|cliff. So, it's going to be 
20110103142410.500|20110103142412.213|TR0|extremely hard to get carbon 
20110103142412.213|20110103142413.926|TR0|emissions to start reversing 
20110103142413.926|20110103142415.639|TR0|when you have people who are 
20110103142415.639|20110103142417.352|TR0|just quoting the Bible as their 
20110103142417.352|20110103142419.066|TR0|scientific policy.
20110103142419.066|20110103142420.779|TR0|
20110103142420.779|20110103142422.492|TR0|Now, Shimkus and Upton are going 
20110103142422.492|20110103142424.205|TR0|to be going after the EPA, which 
20110103142424.205|20110103142425.918|TR0|is the last chance that the U.S. 
20110103142425.918|20110103142427.632|TR0|has to turn around carbon 
20110103142427.632|20110103142429.345|TR0|emissions, at least at this 
20110103142429.345|20110103142431.058|TR0|point. And Shimkus almost became 
20110103142431.058|20110103142432.771|TR0|the committee chairman. He gave 
20110103142432.771|20110103142434.484|TR0|quite a run against Upton to get 
20110103142434.484|20110103142436.197|TR0|that chair. And that's one of 
20110103142436.197|20110103142437.911|TR0|the things that drove Upton so 
20110103142437.911|20110103142439.624|TR0|far to the right. Now, I 
20110103142439.624|20110103142441.337|TR0|followed that race pretty 
20110103142441.337|20110103142443.050|TR0|closely, and it was always a 
20110103142443.050|20110103142444.763|TR0|long shot, but his goal was to 
20110103142444.763|20110103142446.476|TR0|raise his profile, which he did, 
20110103142446.476|20110103142448.190|TR0|and to put himself as the next 
20110103142448.190|20110103142449.903|TR0|in line behind Upton, when he 
20110103142449.903|20110103142451.616|TR0|moves on, because House 
20110103142451.616|20110103142453.329|TR0|Republicans have term limits 
20110103142453.329|20110103142455.042|TR0|where you can only serve three 
20110103142455.042|20110103142456.755|TR0|terms as chairman. So, we could 
20110103142456.755|20110103142458.469|TR0|see him as chairman of the 
20110103142458.469|20110103142500.182|TR0|committee overseeing the energy 
20110103142500.182|20110103142501.895|TR0|industry.

20110103142503.608|20110103142505.321|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Ryan, I want to 
20110103142505.321|20110103142507.035|TR0|break, and then we're going to 
20110103142507.035|20110103142508.748|TR0|come back, and I want to ask you 
20110103142508.748|20110103142510.461|TR0|about Congressman Spencer Bachus 
20110103142510.461|20110103142512.174|TR0|of Alabama to head the House 
20110103142512.174|20110103142513.887|TR0|Financial Services Committee, 
20110103142513.887|20110103142515.600|TR0|the congressman who said the 
20110103142515.600|20110103142517.314|TR0|view in Washington is that banks 
20110103142517.314|20110103142519.027|TR0|should be regulated, "my view is 
20110103142519.027|20110103142520.740|TR0|that Washington and the 
20110103142520.740|20110103142522.453|TR0|regulators are there to serve 
20110103142522.453|20110103142524.166|TR0|the banks." We'll come to him in 
20110103142524.166|20110103142525.879|TR0|a minute. We're talking to Ryan 
20110103142525.879|20110103142527.593|TR0|Grim, senior congressional 
20110103142527.593|20110103142529.306|TR0|correspondent for the Huffington 
20110103142529.306|20110103142531.019|TR0|Post. Back with him in a minute.

20110103142536.158|20110103142537.872|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We're talking 
20110103142537.872|20110103142539.585|TR0|about the incoming Congress. The 
20110103142539.585|20110103142541.298|TR0|House of Representatives turns 
20110103142541.298|20110103142543.011|TR0|Republican on Wednesday. Ryan 
20110103142543.011|20110103142544.724|TR0|Grim is the senior congressional

20110103142546.438|20110103142548.151|TR0|Post. At least, they will be in 
20110103142548.151|20110103142549.864|TR0|the majority. And we're talking 
20110103142549.864|20110103142551.577|TR0|about some of the leaders. Let's 
20110103142551.577|20110103142553.290|TR0|go to Congressmember Spencer 
20110103142553.290|20110103142555.003|TR0|Bachus of Alabama, who becomes 
20110103142555.003|20110103142556.717|TR0|the chair of the House Financial 
20110103142556.717|20110103142558.430|TR0|Services Committee, Ryan.

20110103142600.143|20110103142601.856|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Right. And as you 
20110103142601.856|20110103142603.569|TR0|said before the break, he said 
20110103142603.569|20110103142605.282|TR0|in an interview with a local 
20110103142605.282|20110103142606.996|TR0|paper a week or two ago that, 
20110103142606.996|20110103142608.709|TR0|you know, some people say the 
20110103142608.709|20110103142610.422|TR0|job of Washington is to regulate 
20110103142610.422|20110103142612.135|TR0|the banks, I think it's their - 
20110103142612.135|20110103142613.848|TR0|the job is to serve the banks. 
20110103142613.848|20110103142615.561|TR0|And he was piled on, 
20110103142615.561|20110103142617.275|TR0|appropriately so, for saying 
20110103142617.275|20110103142618.988|TR0|that. You know, when he walked 
20110103142618.988|20110103142620.701|TR0|it back, he said, "Well, what I 
20110103142620.701|20110103142622.414|TR0|meant was they should be serving 
20110103142622.414|20110103142624.127|TR0|community banks, and they should 
20110103142624.127|20110103142625.841|TR0|be writing regulations such that 
20110103142625.841|20110103142627.554|TR0|the banks can serve their 
20110103142627.554|20110103142629.267|TR0|customers," etc. But saying that 
20110103142629.267|20110103142630.980|TR0|really does expose the 
20110103142630.980|20110103142632.693|TR0|differences between the parties, 
20110103142632.693|20110103142634.406|TR0|such as they still exist.
20110103142634.406|20110103142636.120|TR0|
20110103142636.120|20110103142637.833|TR0|And what's crazy is that Spencer 
20110103142637.833|20110103142639.546|TR0|Bachus is actually another one 
20110103142639.546|20110103142641.259|TR0|of the Republicans in this 
20110103142641.259|20110103142642.972|TR0|conference who can be considered 
20110103142642.972|20110103142644.685|TR0|kind of a moderate one. During 
20110103142644.685|20110103142646.399|TR0|the bailout debate, he was one 
20110103142646.399|20110103142648.112|TR0|of those who was negotiating 
20110103142648.112|20110103142649.825|TR0|with Democrats and with the Bush 
20110103142649.825|20110103142651.538|TR0|administration and trying to 
20110103142651.538|20110103142653.251|TR0|find some type of compromise. 
20110103142653.251|20110103142654.964|TR0|And the House Republican 
20110103142654.964|20110103142656.678|TR0|leadership, which, if you 
20110103142656.678|20110103142658.391|TR0|recall, was mostly opposed to 
20110103142658.391|20110103142700.104|TR0|the bailout, except for, you 
20110103142700.104|20110103142701.817|TR0|know, Boehner and the leadership 
20110103142701.817|20110103142703.530|TR0|ultimately got behind it. But 
20110103142703.530|20110103142705.244|TR0|there was a - there were a 
20110103142705.244|20110103142706.957|TR0|collection of folks who were 
20110103142706.957|20110103142708.670|TR0|trying to pull the House 
20110103142708.670|20110103142710.383|TR0|Republicans out of that bailout. 
20110103142710.383|20110103142712.096|TR0|They almost physically dragged 
20110103142712.096|20110103142713.809|TR0|Bachus out of the room, out of 
20110103142713.809|20110103142715.523|TR0|the negotiations, and so he 
20110103142715.523|20110103142717.236|TR0|ended up not being ultimately 
20110103142717.236|20110103142718.949|TR0|part of it. Now, you know, you 
20110103142718.949|20110103142720.662|TR0|could say, good for those House 
20110103142720.662|20110103142722.375|TR0|Republicans at the time who were 
20110103142722.375|20110103142724.088|TR0|opposing the bailout, but it 
20110103142724.088|20110103142725.802|TR0|shows you that Bachus is another 
20110103142725.802|20110103142727.515|TR0|one who's going to be kept on an 
20110103142727.515|20110103142729.228|TR0|extremely tight leash by the far 
20110103142729.228|20110103142730.941|TR0|right of this Republican 
20110103142730.941|20110103142732.654|TR0|conference.

20110103142734.367|20110103142736.081|TR0|And, you know, the question that 
20110103142736.081|20110103142737.794|TR0|the House is able to face is, 
20110103142737.794|20110103142739.507|TR0|how much funding are you going 
20110103142739.507|20110103142741.220|TR0|to give to the regulators in 
20110103142741.220|20110103142742.933|TR0|order to implement the 
20110103142742.933|20110103142744.647|TR0|Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform 
20110103142744.647|20110103142746.360|TR0|bill? And they've already 
20110103142746.360|20110103142748.073|TR0|indicated that they're going to 
20110103142748.073|20110103142749.786|TR0|make the funding as restrictive 
20110103142749.786|20110103142751.499|TR0|as possible. And if you can't 
20110103142751.499|20110103142753.212|TR0|hire more folks, then you can't 
20110103142753.212|20110103142754.926|TR0|implement these regulations. And 
20110103142754.926|20110103142756.639|TR0|the SEC and the other regulators 
20110103142756.639|20110103142758.352|TR0|are already saying that if they 
20110103142758.352|20110103142800.065|TR0|don't get more money and more 
20110103142800.065|20110103142801.778|TR0|staff, then they simply can't 
20110103142801.778|20110103142803.491|TR0|put these new rules into effect, 
20110103142803.491|20110103142805.205|TR0|which is the purpose, you know, 
20110103142805.205|20110103142806.918|TR0|behind restricting the money.
20110103142806.918|20110103142808.631|TR0|
20110103142808.631|20110103142810.344|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Let's go to Hal 
20110103142810.344|20110103142812.057|TR0|Rogers, the Kentucky Congress 
20110103142812.057|20110103142813.770|TR0|member who is going to be head 
20110103142813.770|20110103142815.484|TR0|of Oversight, known as the 
20110103142815.484|20110103142817.197|TR0|"prince of pork." What did ABC 
20110103142817.197|20110103142818.910|TR0|News describe his neighborhood 
20110103142818.910|20110103142820.623|TR0|as?
20110103142820.623|20110103142822.336|TR0|
20110103142822.336|20110103142824.050|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Oh, what did they 
20110103142824.050|20110103142825.763|TR0|call that?
20110103142825.763|20110103142827.476|TR0|
20110103142827.476|20110103142829.189|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Rogers brought 
20110103142829.189|20110103142830.902|TR0|so much federal -
20110103142830.902|20110103142832.615|TR0|
20110103142832.615|20110103142834.329|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Oh, "Mr. Rogers' 
20110103142834.329|20110103142836.042|TR0|neighborhood," that's what they 
20110103142836.042|20110103142837.755|TR0|called that, because, you know, 
20110103142837.755|20110103142839.468|TR0|it was a town of a couple 
20110103142839.468|20110103142841.181|TR0|thousand, and, you know, he just 
20110103142841.181|20110103142842.894|TR0|made it rain all over his home 
20110103142842.894|20110103142844.608|TR0|town. They renamed one highway, 
20110103142844.608|20110103142846.321|TR0|that was called the Daniel Boone 
20110103142846.321|20110103142848.034|TR0|Highway, they renamed it the Hal 
20110103142848.034|20110103142849.747|TR0|Rogers Highway. You know, he is 
20110103142849.747|20110103142851.460|TR0|one of those Republicans who, in 
20110103142851.460|20110103142853.174|TR0|a bipartisan way, just saw the 
20110103142853.174|20110103142854.887|TR0|budget as a trough to just pull 
20110103142854.887|20110103142856.600|TR0|as much pork back to their home 
20110103142856.600|20110103142858.313|TR0|state as possible. And he was 
20110103142858.313|20110103142900.026|TR0|extremely good at it. And now 
20110103142900.026|20110103142901.739|TR0|the table has kind of turned on 
20110103142901.739|20110103142903.453|TR0|him, as even people in Kentucky, 
20110103142903.453|20110103142905.166|TR0|the people who were the 
20110103142905.166|20110103142906.879|TR0|recipients of his largesse, are 
20110103142906.879|20110103142908.592|TR0|turning on him, and "pork" has 
20110103142908.592|20110103142910.305|TR0|become a dirty word, even for 
20110103142910.305|20110103142912.018|TR0|the people that dine on it back 
20110103142912.018|20110103142913.732|TR0|at home. So he's going to have a 
20110103142913.732|20110103142915.445|TR0|real adjustment period, as - so 
20110103142915.445|20110103142917.158|TR0|he runs the Appropriations 
20110103142917.158|20110103142918.871|TR0|Committee.
20110103142918.871|20110103142920.584|TR0|
20110103142920.584|20110103142922.297|TR0|And what's interesting is that 
20110103142922.297|20110103142924.011|TR0|Boehner has actually booted them 
20110103142924.011|20110103142925.724|TR0|out of this extremely valuable 
20110103142925.724|20110103142927.437|TR0|real estate that they had. They 
20110103142927.437|20110103142929.150|TR0|had this huge spread and a giant 
20110103142929.150|20110103142930.863|TR0|balcony just off the House 
20110103142930.863|20110103142932.577|TR0|floor. Boehner saw that the 
20110103142932.577|20110103142934.290|TR0|Appropriations Committee was 
20110103142934.290|20110103142936.003|TR0|vulnerable, and he wanted that 
20110103142936.003|20110103142937.716|TR0|office space. So they're getting 
20110103142937.716|20110103142939.429|TR0|bumped to another part of the 
20110103142939.429|20110103142941.142|TR0|Capitol. It's not clear where 
20110103142941.142|20110103142942.856|TR0|yet, probably somewhere in the 
20110103142942.856|20110103142944.569|TR0|visitors' center, if I had to 
20110103142944.569|20110103142946.282|TR0|guess. And, you know, the final 
20110103142946.282|20110103142947.995|TR0|irony is that Boehner said that 
20110103142947.995|20110103142949.708|TR0|he had to move the 
20110103142949.708|20110103142951.421|TR0|Appropriations Committee because 
20110103142951.421|20110103142953.135|TR0|he wanted to install a women's 
20110103142953.135|20110103142954.848|TR0|bathroom near the House floor. 
20110103142954.848|20110103142956.561|TR0|You know, nobody that is 
20110103142956.561|20110103142958.274|TR0|involved with this fight thinks 
20110103142958.274|20110103142959.987|TR0|that it had anything to do with 
20110103142959.987|20110103143001.700|TR0|creating a women's bathroom, but 
20110103143001.700|20110103143003.414|TR0|it was a land grab. But that 
20110103143003.414|20110103143005.127|TR0|shows you where the 
20110103143005.127|20110103143006.840|TR0|Appropriations Committee stands, 
20110103143006.840|20110103143008.553|TR0|in terms of respect in the House 
20110103143008.553|20110103143010.266|TR0|Republican committee. You no 
20110103143010.266|20110103143011.980|TR0|longer want to be on the 
20110103143011.980|20110103143013.693|TR0|committee that used to be the 
20110103143013.693|20110103143015.406|TR0|one that everybody pined to be 
20110103143015.406|20110103143017.119|TR0|the leader of.
20110103143017.119|20110103143018.832|TR0|
20110103143018.832|20110103143020.545|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Congressmember 
20110103143020.545|20110103143022.259|TR0|Lamar Smith of Texas to head 
20110103143022.259|20110103143023.972|TR0|Judiciary?
20110103143023.972|20110103143025.685|TR0|
20110103143025.685|20110103143027.398|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Right. I mean, he 
20110103143027.398|20110103143029.111|TR0|has already hinted that Obama 
20110103143029.111|20110103143030.824|TR0|has done some things that may be 
20110103143030.824|20110103143032.538|TR0|impeachable. There are some very 
20110103143032.538|20110103143034.251|TR0|reasonable people that think 
20110103143034.251|20110103143035.964|TR0|that if Obama does win 
20110103143035.964|20110103143037.677|TR0|reelection and House Republicans 
20110103143037.677|20110103143039.390|TR0|stay in the majority, that 
20110103143039.390|20110103143041.103|TR0|you'll see him impeached at some 
20110103143041.103|20110103143042.817|TR0|point during his eight years. Or 
20110103143042.817|20110103143044.530|TR0|at least you're going to 
20110103143044.530|20110103143046.243|TR0|probably see some articles of 
20110103143046.243|20110103143047.956|TR0|impeachment. This is - you know, 
20110103143047.956|20110103143049.669|TR0|the fact that they've already 
20110103143049.669|20110103143051.383|TR0|raised this as a possibility is 
20110103143051.383|20110103143053.096|TR0|something that the 
20110103143053.096|20110103143054.809|TR0|administration is watching 
20110103143054.809|20110103143056.522|TR0|closely.
20110103143056.522|20110103143058.235|TR0|
20110103143058.235|20110103143059.948|TR0|On broader policy, Smith is 
20110103143059.948|20110103143101.662|TR0|extremely hawkish on immigration 
20110103143101.662|20110103143103.375|TR0|policy. And so, you're going to 
20110103143103.375|20110103143105.088|TR0|see a lot of hearings and laws 
20110103143105.088|20110103143106.801|TR0|coming out of this panel aimed 
20110103143106.801|20110103143108.514|TR0|at undocumented workers.

20110103143110.227|20110103143111.941|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Armed Services 
20110103143111.941|20110103143113.654|TR0|Committee, Buck McKeon of 
20110103143113.654|20110103143115.367|TR0|California was opposed to the 
20110103143115.367|20110103143117.080|TR0|repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't 
20110103143117.080|20110103143118.793|TR0|Tell."
20110103143118.793|20110103143120.506|TR0|
20110103143120.506|20110103143122.220|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Right. And he's 
20110103143122.220|20110103143123.933|TR0|another one of these old-school 
20110103143123.933|20110103143125.646|TR0|Republicans who's going to have 
20110103143125.646|20110103143127.359|TR0|trouble fitting into this new 
20110103143127.359|20110103143129.072|TR0|Tea Party suit, because there is 
20110103143129.072|20110103143130.786|TR0|all of this talk about cutting 
20110103143130.786|20110103143132.499|TR0|spending going on, but he has 
20110103143132.499|20110103143134.212|TR0|already said, "Look, what we 
20110103143134.212|20110103143135.925|TR0|need to do is increase spending 
20110103143135.925|20110103143137.638|TR0|on defense." So, you know, it's 
20110103143137.638|20110103143139.351|TR0|like all of these old-school 
20110103143139.351|20110103143141.065|TR0|Republicans are waking up in 
20110103143141.065|20110103143142.778|TR0|this new world, and it's going 
20110103143142.778|20110103143144.491|TR0|to be very hard for them to deal 
20110103143144.491|20110103143146.204|TR0|with this, because once you 
20110103143146.204|20110103143147.917|TR0|start trying to cut $100 billion 
20110103143147.917|20110103143149.630|TR0|out of a $300 billion half-year 
20110103143149.630|20110103143151.344|TR0|discretionary budget, you're 
20110103143151.344|20110103143153.057|TR0|going to see deep, deep cuts to 
20110103143153.057|20110103143154.770|TR0|social services. And so, people 
20110103143154.770|20110103143156.483|TR0|are going to then start 
20110103143156.483|20110103143158.196|TR0|wondering, well, why isn't the 
20110103143158.196|20110103143159.909|TR0|military-industrial complex 
20110103143159.909|20110103143201.623|TR0|taking any of this, as well? So,

20110103143206.762|20110103143208.475|TR0|So that's going to be another

20110103143229.033|20110103143230.747|TR0|>> RYAN GRIM: Right. They say 
20110103143230.747|20110103143232.460|TR0|they're going to do that as 
20110103143232.460|20110103143234.173|TR0|frequently as possible. They're 
20110103143234.173|20110103143235.886|TR0|going to start reading the 
20110103143235.886|20110103143237.599|TR0|Constitution. And, you know, 
20110103143237.599|20110103143239.312|TR0|there are some strange parts of 
20110103143239.312|20110103143241.026|TR0|that Constitution. I'm not sure 
20110103143241.026|20110103143242.739|TR0|if they're going to read the 
20110103143242.739|20110103143244.452|TR0|parts that have rightly been 
20110103143244.452|20110103143246.165|TR0|scratched out so far or what. 
20110103143246.165|20110103143247.878|TR0|But they're already saying that 
20110103143247.878|20110103143249.592|TR0|the first week that they're in, 
20110103143249.592|20110103143251.305|TR0|they're going to have a vote - 
20110103143251.305|20110103143253.018|TR0|it'll be symbolic, because it 
20110103143253.018|20110103143254.731|TR0|won't pass the Senate, but 
20110103143254.731|20110103143256.444|TR0|they're going to have a vote to 
20110103143256.444|20110103143258.157|TR0|repeal the healthcare bill. So,

20110103143646.010|20110103143647.723|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Thanks for 
20110103143647.723|20110103143649.436|TR0|having me.

20110103143651.149|20110103143652.862|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Why don't you 
20110103143652.862|20110103143654.575|TR0|give us the biography of this, 
20110103143654.575|20110103143656.289|TR0|well, remarkable new president 
20110103143656.289|20110103143658.002|TR0|of Brazil? Her history is 
20110103143658.002|20110103143659.715|TR0|astounding, Dilma Rousseff.
20110103143659.715|20110103143701.428|TR0|
20110103143701.428|20110103143703.141|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, arguably 
20110103143703.141|20110103143704.854|TR0|the most powerful woman in the 
20110103143704.854|20110103143706.568|TR0|world. She was born in 1947 - 
20110103143706.568|20110103143708.281|TR0|she's 63 years old - in the 
20110103143708.281|20110103143709.994|TR0|provinces, a middle-class 
20110103143709.994|20110103143711.707|TR0|family, lower middle class. Her 
20110103143711.707|20110103143713.420|TR0|father was a Bulgarian 
20110103143713.420|20110103143715.133|TR0|immigrant, her mother a 
20110103143715.133|20110103143716.847|TR0|Brazilian school teacher. And 
20110103143716.847|20110103143718.560|TR0|she came of age during a time 
20110103143718.560|20110103143720.273|TR0|when the middle class could 
20110103143720.273|20110103143721.986|TR0|actually develop a social 
20110103143721.986|20110103143723.699|TR0|consciousness, a political 
20110103143723.699|20110103143725.413|TR0|consciousness. Her mother had 
20110103143725.413|20110103143727.126|TR0|her read Zola and Dostoevsky. 
20110103143727.126|20110103143728.839|TR0|The nuns at her school 
20110103143728.839|20110103143730.552|TR0|introduced her to rural poverty, 
20110103143730.552|20110103143732.265|TR0|urban poverty. And she became 
20110103143732.265|20110103143733.978|TR0|political at an early age. And 
20110103143733.978|20110103143735.692|TR0|when she was 16 years old, she 
20110103143735.692|20110103143737.405|TR0|joined a political faction that 
20110103143737.405|20110103143739.118|TR0|had split off from the Communist 
20110103143739.118|20110103143740.831|TR0|Party to work with urban 
20110103143740.831|20110103143742.544|TR0|workers. And then, with the 
20110103143742.544|20110103143744.257|TR0|coups in Brazil - there was one 
20110103143744.257|20110103143745.971|TR0|coup in '64 and then a much more 
20110103143745.971|20110103143747.684|TR0|radical right-wing coup in '68 - 
20110103143747.684|20110103143749.397|TR0|she became much more politicized 
20110103143749.397|20110103143751.110|TR0|herself. She joined an urban 
20110103143751.110|20110103143752.823|TR0|guerrilla group in - I think 
20110103143752.823|20110103143754.536|TR0|probably in 1967, '68. And she 
20110103143754.536|20110103143756.250|TR0|was arrested in 1970. And just 
20110103143756.250|20110103143757.963|TR0|over the last couple of months, 
20110103143757.963|20110103143759.676|TR0|documents have been declassified 
20110103143759.676|20110103143801.389|TR0|in Brazil that illustrate that 
20110103143801.389|20110103143803.102|TR0|she suffered widespread torture, 
20110103143803.102|20110103143804.816|TR0|extreme torture, electric 
20110103143804.816|20110103143806.529|TR0|torture. She was released after 
20110103143806.529|20110103143808.242|TR0|a little bit less than three 
20110103143808.242|20110103143809.955|TR0|years.
20110103143809.955|20110103143811.668|TR0|
20110103143811.668|20110103143813.381|TR0|And she went on to get a degree 
20110103143813.381|20110103143815.095|TR0|in economics, and she entered 
20110103143815.095|20110103143816.808|TR0|politics, first in the state of 
20110103143816.808|20110103143818.521|TR0|Porto Alegre and then in Rio 
20110103143818.521|20110103143820.234|TR0|Grande do Sul. And she developed 
20110103143820.234|20110103143821.947|TR0|a reputation as an extremely 
20110103143821.947|20110103143823.660|TR0|efficient economist and 
20110103143823.660|20110103143825.374|TR0|administrator, particularly 
20110103143825.374|20110103143827.087|TR0|around energy issues. When she 
20110103143827.087|20110103143828.800|TR0|was the minister of energy in 
20110103143828.800|20110103143830.513|TR0|Rio Grande in the 1990s, you can 
20110103143830.513|20110103143832.226|TR0|think of her as being the 
20110103143832.226|20110103143833.939|TR0|anti-Enron. Where Enron 
20110103143833.939|20110103143835.653|TR0|speculated and basically turned 
20110103143835.653|20110103143837.366|TR0|energy into a big gaming 
20110103143837.366|20110103143839.079|TR0|initiative in the United States 
20110103143839.079|20110103143840.792|TR0|and led to rolling blackouts in 
20110103143840.792|20110103143842.505|TR0|California, she did the exact 
20110103143842.505|20110103143844.219|TR0|opposite. She built up public 
20110103143844.219|20110103143845.932|TR0|infrastructure. She invested 
20110103143845.932|20110103143847.645|TR0|heavily. She consolidated the 
20110103143847.645|20110103143849.358|TR0|notion that energy was a common 
20110103143849.358|20110103143851.071|TR0|good, a public good. And then 
20110103143851.071|20110103143852.784|TR0|she joined the Workers' Party 
20110103143852.784|20110103143854.498|TR0|around 2000 and became Lula's 
20110103143854.498|20110103143856.211|TR0|chief of staff in 2003.
20110103143856.211|20110103143857.924|TR0|
20110103143857.924|20110103143859.637|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: The first woman 
20110103143859.637|20110103143901.350|TR0|chief of staff of Brazil.
20110103143901.350|20110103143903.063|TR0|
20110103143903.063|20110103143904.777|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, well, 
20110103143904.777|20110103143906.490|TR0|first she was minister of 
20110103143906.490|20110103143908.203|TR0|energy, and she was always - she 
20110103143908.203|20110103143909.916|TR0|was involved in overseeing 
20110103143909.916|20110103143911.629|TR0|Petrobras, Brazil's public oil 
20110103143911.629|20110103143913.342|TR0|company, over the course of 
20110103143913.342|20110103143915.056|TR0|Lula's two administrations. But 
20110103143915.056|20110103143916.769|TR0|first she was minister of energy 
20110103143916.769|20110103143918.482|TR0|on a national level, and then 
20110103143918.482|20110103143920.195|TR0|she became chief of staff in 
20110103143920.195|20110103143921.908|TR0|2004, I believe, early on in 
20110103143921.908|20110103143923.622|TR0|about the middle of his - of 
20110103143923.622|20110103143925.335|TR0|Lula's first term, after a 
20110103143925.335|20110103143927.048|TR0|series of scandals pushed out 
20110103143927.048|20110103143928.761|TR0|Lula's first chief of staff, and 
20110103143928.761|20110103143930.474|TR0|has been described as Lula's 
20110103143930.474|20110103143932.187|TR0|prime minister - there's no 
20110103143932.187|20110103143933.901|TR0|prime minister officially in 
20110103143933.901|20110103143935.614|TR0|Brazil, but basically an 
20110103143935.614|20110103143937.327|TR0|executor of domestic policy, 
20110103143937.327|20110103143939.040|TR0|particularly around energy.
20110103143939.040|20110103143940.753|TR0|
20110103143940.753|20110103143942.466|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And she also had 
20110103143942.466|20110103143944.180|TR0|cancer.
20110103143944.180|20110103143945.893|TR0|
20110103143945.893|20110103143947.606|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: She did. She 
20110103143947.606|20110103143949.319|TR0|overcame and apparently 
20110103143949.319|20110103143951.032|TR0|triumphed over lymphoma, serious 
20110103143951.032|20110103143952.745|TR0|form of cancer. And this was 
20110103143952.745|20110103143954.459|TR0|caught after she had already 
20110103143954.459|20110103143956.172|TR0|announced for the presidency, 
20110103143956.172|20110103143957.885|TR0|and apparently has - is in 
20110103143957.885|20110103143959.598|TR0|remission.
20110103143959.598|20110103144001.311|TR0|
20110103144001.311|20110103144003.025|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, talk about 
20110103144003.025|20110103144004.738|TR0|how she became the president of 
20110103144004.738|20110103144006.451|TR0|Brazil.
20110103144006.451|20110103144008.164|TR0|
20110103144008.164|20110103144009.877|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Well, Lula is 
20110103144009.877|20110103144011.590|TR0|enormously popular, and she was 
20110103144011.590|20110103144013.304|TR0|Lula's handpicked successor, 
20110103144013.304|20110103144015.017|TR0|basically. As I said, she was 
20110103144015.017|20110103144016.730|TR0|Lula's right-hand woman. She was 
20110103144016.730|20110103144018.443|TR0|very close, and they developed a 
20110103144018.443|20110103144020.156|TR0|very close bond. And he - and 
20110103144020.156|20110103144021.869|TR0|Lula's enormous popularity, he's 
20110103144021.869|20110103144023.583|TR0|going out of office with 80 
20110103144023.583|20110103144025.296|TR0|percent popular approval 
20110103144025.296|20110103144027.009|TR0|ratings. And internationally, he 
20110103144027.009|20110103144028.722|TR0|has basically changed the rules 
20110103144028.722|20110103144030.435|TR0|of the interstate system on a 
20110103144030.435|20110103144032.148|TR0|number of levels, which we could 
20110103144032.148|20110103144033.862|TR0|talk about, certainly in the 
20110103144033.862|20110103144035.575|TR0|Americas. And so, he threw his 
20110103144035.575|20110103144037.288|TR0|enormous weight behind her.
20110103144037.288|20110103144039.001|TR0|
20110103144039.001|20110103144040.714|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to 
20110103144040.714|20110103144042.428|TR0|a clip of Lula, the outgoing 
20110103144042.428|20110103144044.141|TR0|Brazilian president, Lula da 
20110103144044.141|20110103144045.854|TR0|Silva, who broke into tears 
20110103144045.854|20110103144047.567|TR0|during his farewell address.
20110103144047.567|20110103144049.280|TR0|
20110103144049.280|20110103144050.993|TR0|>> PRESIDENT LUIZ INACIO LULA DA 
20110103144050.993|20110103144052.707|TR0|SILVA: [translated] Back then, I 
20110103144052.707|20110103144054.420|TR0|was worried. What was my 
20110103144054.420|20110103144056.133|TR0|concern? Was I ready to rule 
20110103144056.133|20110103144057.846|TR0|this country? Was I prepared to 
20110103144057.846|20110103144059.559|TR0|deal with everything? Sometimes 
20110103144059.559|20110103144101.272|TR0|I would lie down next to my wife 
20110103144101.272|20110103144102.986|TR0|in the government's palace, and 
20110103144102.986|20110103144104.699|TR0|I would say, "Marisa, I wonder 
20110103144104.699|20110103144106.412|TR0|if this is real, if we are 
20110103144106.412|20110103144108.125|TR0|actually here. We are sleeping 
20110103144108.125|20110103144109.838|TR0|in the room on the same bed that 
20110103144109.838|20110103144111.551|TR0|so many presidents have slept, 
20110103144111.551|20110103144113.265|TR0|on this bed. Marisa, is this 
20110103144113.265|20110103144114.978|TR0|actually real?" If I fail, it 
20110103144114.978|20110103144116.691|TR0|would be the workers' class 
20110103144116.691|20110103144118.404|TR0|which would be failing. It would 
20110103144118.404|20110103144120.117|TR0|be the country's poor who would 
20110103144120.117|20110103144121.831|TR0|be proving they did not have 
20110103144121.831|20110103144123.544|TR0|what it takes to rule.
20110103144123.544|20110103144125.257|TR0|
20110103144125.257|20110103144126.970|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was the 
20110103144126.970|20110103144128.683|TR0|outgoing president of Brazil 
20110103144128.683|20110103144130.396|TR0|Lula. And now it's Dilma 
20110103144130.396|20110103144132.110|TR0|Rousseff, the first woman 
20110103144132.110|20110103144133.823|TR0|president of Brazil. Let's talk 
20110103144133.823|20110103144135.536|TR0|about where she will take the 
20110103144135.536|20110103144137.249|TR0|country, what her stands are. 
20110103144137.249|20110103144138.962|TR0|First, is it fair to call her 
20110103144138.962|20110103144140.675|TR0|the Marxist guerrilla turned 
20110103144140.675|20110103144142.389|TR0|president?
20110103144142.389|20110103144144.102|TR0|
20110103144144.102|20110103144145.815|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Well, I mean, 
20110103144145.815|20110103144147.528|TR0|she's obviously evolved in her 
20110103144147.528|20110103144149.241|TR0|political and economic views and 
20110103144149.241|20110103144150.954|TR0|what she personally believes 
20110103144150.954|20110103144152.668|TR0|will be conditioned by the 
20110103144152.668|20110103144154.381|TR0|realities and complexities of 
20110103144154.381|20110103144156.094|TR0|Brazilian society. It's the 
20110103144156.094|20110103144157.807|TR0|largest economy in the Americas, 
20110103144157.807|20110103144159.520|TR0|short of the United States and 
20110103144159.520|20110103144201.234|TR0|Canada, certainly in Latin 
20110103144201.234|20110103144202.947|TR0|America. It has a complex social 
20110103144202.947|20110103144204.660|TR0|system and political structure, 
20110103144204.660|20110103144206.373|TR0|so she will not - you know, 
20110103144206.373|20110103144208.086|TR0|however she understands her role 
20110103144208.086|20110103144209.799|TR0|or her ethics and beliefs, she 
20110103144209.799|20110103144211.513|TR0|will be conditioned by that, 
20110103144211.513|20110103144213.226|TR0|just as Lula was.
20110103144213.226|20110103144214.939|TR0|
20110103144214.939|20110103144216.652|TR0|She represents a number of 
20110103144216.652|20110103144218.365|TR0|things. I think she represents, 
20110103144218.365|20110103144220.078|TR0|as coming to the office as a 
20110103144220.078|20110103144221.792|TR0|torture victim, it's important 
20110103144221.792|20110103144223.505|TR0|to point out that Brazil, in 
20110103144223.505|20110103144225.218|TR0|some ways, hasn't confronted its 
20110103144225.218|20110103144226.931|TR0|past. Some 17,000 to 20,000 
20110103144226.931|20110103144228.644|TR0|Brazilians were tortured under 
20110103144228.644|20110103144230.357|TR0|the dictatorship. Other 
20110103144230.357|20110103144232.071|TR0|countries in the Southern Cone - 
20110103144232.071|20110103144233.784|TR0|Chile, Argentina, Uruguay - have 
20110103144233.784|20110103144235.497|TR0|confronted this legacy more 
20110103144235.497|20110103144237.210|TR0|directly.
20110103144237.210|20110103144238.923|TR0|
20110103144238.923|20110103144240.637|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I mean, 
20110103144240.637|20110103144242.350|TR0|Argentina has something like 400 
20110103144242.350|20110103144244.063|TR0|trials going on right now.
20110103144244.063|20110103144245.776|TR0|
20110103144245.776|20110103144247.489|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, right.
20110103144247.489|20110103144249.202|TR0|
20110103144249.202|20110103144250.916|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And Videla was 
20110103144250.916|20110103144252.629|TR0|just put away for life.
20110103144252.629|20110103144254.342|TR0|
20110103144254.342|20110103144256.055|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: And in all 
20110103144256.055|20110103144257.768|TR0|sorts of ways, there's been much 
20110103144257.768|20110103144259.481|TR0|more direct confrontation. Lula 
20110103144259.481|20110103144301.195|TR0|was very reticent on taking on 
20110103144301.195|20110103144302.908|TR0|this issue. There was an amnesty 
20110103144302.908|20110103144304.621|TR0|law that was passed in 1979 that 
20110103144304.621|20110103144306.334|TR0|just in April of this past - in 
20110103144306.334|20110103144308.047|TR0|2010, was reaffirmed, in which 
20110103144308.047|20110103144309.761|TR0|torturers and murderers and 
20110103144309.761|20110103144311.474|TR0|repressors during the military 
20110103144311.474|20110103144313.187|TR0|regime can't be touched. Right 
20110103144313.187|20110103144314.900|TR0|now, as we speak, three or four 
20110103144314.900|20110103144316.613|TR0|of the people responsible for 
20110103144316.613|20110103144318.326|TR0|Dilma's torture are under 
20110103144318.326|20110103144320.040|TR0|investigation. They can't be 
20110103144320.040|20110103144321.753|TR0|prosecuted criminally because of 
20110103144321.753|20110103144323.466|TR0|the upholding of this amnesty 
20110103144323.466|20110103144325.179|TR0|law, but they can be brought in 
20110103144325.179|20110103144326.892|TR0|civil trials. They could have 
20110103144326.892|20110103144328.605|TR0|their pension removed. I think 
20110103144328.605|20110103144330.319|TR0|Dilma's ascension to the 
20110103144330.319|20110103144332.032|TR0|presidency will in some ways 
20110103144332.032|20110103144333.745|TR0|force this issue, which has been 
20110103144333.745|20110103144335.458|TR0|off the table, into public 
20110103144335.458|20110103144337.171|TR0|discussion, along the lines of 
20110103144337.171|20110103144338.884|TR0|in Venezuela, in Chile, in 
20110103144338.884|20110103144340.598|TR0|Uruguay.
20110103144340.598|20110103144342.311|TR0|
20110103144342.311|20110103144344.024|TR0|In terms of foreign policy, it 
20110103144344.024|20110103144345.737|TR0|seems that she's committed to 
20110103144345.737|20110103144347.450|TR0|continuing Lula's - Lula did a - 
20110103144347.450|20110103144349.164|TR0|I mean, it must be said, Lula 
20110103144349.164|20110103144350.877|TR0|presided over this enormous 
20110103144350.877|20110103144352.590|TR0|revolution in the interstate 
20110103144352.590|20110103144354.303|TR0|system. He basically was able to 
20110103144354.303|20110103144356.016|TR0|further integration among Latin 
20110103144356.016|20110103144357.729|TR0|America, steer an independent 
20110103144357.729|20110103144359.443|TR0|course outside of the U.S. on a 
20110103144359.443|20110103144401.156|TR0|host of issues - Iran, 
20110103144401.156|20110103144402.869|TR0|Venezuela, Palestine. Mahmoud 
20110103144402.869|20110103144404.582|TR0|Abbas was actually also at the 
20110103144404.582|20110103144406.295|TR0|inauguration. He laid the 
20110103144406.295|20110103144408.008|TR0|cornerstone of a Palestinian 
20110103144408.008|20110103144409.722|TR0|embassy in Brasilia, because 
20110103144409.722|20110103144411.435|TR0|Lula recognized Palestine.
20110103144411.435|20110103144413.148|TR0|
20110103144413.148|20110103144414.861|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Very 
20110103144414.861|20110103144416.574|TR0|significant. Brazil did. Bolivia 
20110103144416.574|20110103144418.287|TR0|did.
20110103144418.287|20110103144420.001|TR0|
20110103144420.001|20110103144421.714|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Then Argentina. 
20110103144421.714|20110103144423.427|TR0|Yeah, then Bolivia, yeah.
20110103144423.427|20110103144425.140|TR0|
20110103144425.140|20110103144426.853|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Argentina.
20110103144426.853|20110103144428.567|TR0|
20110103144428.567|20110103144430.280|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, very 
20110103144430.280|20110103144431.993|TR0|significant. And it seems clear 
20110103144431.993|20110103144433.706|TR0|that Dilma will try to carry on 
20110103144433.706|20110103144435.419|TR0|this legacy. Whether she's 
20110103144435.419|20110103144437.132|TR0|successful and has the same - I 
20110103144437.132|20110103144438.846|TR0|think there will be a lot of 
20110103144438.846|20110103144440.559|TR0|pressure on her.
20110103144440.559|20110103144442.272|TR0|
20110103144442.272|20110103144443.985|TR0|Domestically, I think she faces 
20110103144443.985|20110103144445.698|TR0|quite a number of challenges. 
20110103144445.698|20110103144447.411|TR0|She's known as a statist, in 
20110103144447.411|20110103144449.125|TR0|terms of the economy, and she 
20110103144449.125|20110103144450.838|TR0|presided over Lula's very 
20110103144450.838|20110103144452.551|TR0|successful investment in public 
20110103144452.551|20110103144454.264|TR0|infrastructure, in public 
20110103144454.264|20110103144455.977|TR0|economic growth. But she's going 
20110103144455.977|20110103144457.690|TR0|to be under a lot of pressure to 
20110103144457.690|20110103144459.404|TR0|privatize and to roll back 
20110103144459.404|20110103144501.117|TR0|spending in order to lower 
20110103144501.117|20110103144502.830|TR0|interest rates. And the only 
20110103144502.830|20110103144504.543|TR0|place you can really do that is 
20110103144504.543|20110103144506.256|TR0|cutting back a lot of the social 
20110103144506.256|20110103144507.970|TR0|spending that the Lula 
20110103144507.970|20110103144509.683|TR0|administration, that you talked 
20110103144509.683|20110103144511.396|TR0|about in your introduction, was 
20110103144511.396|20110103144513.109|TR0|quite successful at.
20110103144513.109|20110103144514.822|TR0|
20110103144514.822|20110103144516.535|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Very quickly, 
20110103144516.535|20110103144518.249|TR0|under - in one of the WikiLeaks 
20110103144518.249|20110103144519.962|TR0|releases, one of the U.S. 
20110103144519.962|20110103144521.675|TR0|diplomatic cables, talking about 
20110103144521.675|20110103144523.388|TR0|the Landless Movement in Brazil 
20110103144523.388|20110103144525.101|TR0|and the effect Lula had in 
20110103144525.101|20110103144526.814|TR0|marginalizing them. Again, this 
20110103144526.814|20110103144528.528|TR0|was the U.S. government's view.
20110103144528.528|20110103144530.241|TR0|
20110103144530.241|20110103144531.954|TR0|>> GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, I mean, I 
20110103144531.954|20110103144533.667|TR0|think the way to think about it 
20110103144533.667|20110103144535.380|TR0|is Lula turned the PT, the 
20110103144535.380|20110103144537.093|TR0|Workers' Party, from a mobilized

20110103144540.520|20110103144542.233|TR0|party. And part of that was not 
20110103144542.233|20110103144543.946|TR0|- and Lula didn't fulfill his

20110103144609.644|20110103144611.357|TR0|Dilma. It remains to be seen how

20110103144654.186|20110103144655.899|TR0|when Obama and Chavez seemed to

20110103144657.613|20110103144659.326|TR0|but then events quickly overtook

20110103144702.752|20110103144704.465|TR0|and its - or not support maybe

20110103144706.179|20110103144707.892|TR0|legitimating the coup, which

20110103144714.744|20110103144716.458|TR0|Obviously Chavez could be quite

20110103144755.861|20110103144757.574|TR0|headed by women. That's not 
20110103144757.574|20110103144759.287|TR0|quite parity, but it's three 
20110103144759.287|20110103144801.000|TR0|times more than under the Lula 
20110103144801.000|20110103144802.713|TR0|administration. Unfortunately, 
20110103144802.713|20110103144804.426|TR0|it seems like the men are in

20110103144811.279|20110103144812.992|TR0|it certainly will have a

20110103145014.628|20110103145016.341|TR0|new deployment under Commander 
20110103145016.341|20110103145018.054|TR0|Honors' command. Well, we're 
20110103145018.054|20110103145019.767|TR0|joined now by the reporter who 
20110103145019.767|20110103145021.480|TR0|broke this story. She's Corinne 
20110103145021.480|20110103145023.194|TR0|Reilly of The Virginian-Pilot. 
20110103145023.194|20110103145024.907|TR0|She's joining us on the 
20110103145024.907|20110103145026.620|TR0|telephone from Norfolk, 
20110103145026.620|20110103145028.333|TR0|Virginia. And we're joined in 
20110103145028.333|20110103145030.046|TR0|Washington, D.C. by Eugene 
20110103145030.046|20110103145031.759|TR0|Fidell. He is an attorney in 
20110103145031.759|20110103145033.473|TR0|private practice, a lecturer at 
20110103145033.473|20110103145035.186|TR0|Yale Law School, and president 
20110103145035.186|20110103145036.899|TR0|of the National Institute of 
20110103145036.899|20110103145038.612|TR0|Military Justice.

20110103145040.325|20110103145042.038|TR0|But Corinne Reilly, let's go to 
20110103145042.038|20110103145043.752|TR0|you first. How did you obtain 
20110103145043.752|20110103145045.465|TR0|these videotapes?
20110103145045.465|20110103145047.178|TR0|
20110103145047.178|20110103145048.891|TR0|>> CORINNE REILLY: They were 
20110103145048.891|20110103145050.604|TR0|provided to the newspaper by a 
20110103145050.604|20110103145052.317|TR0|source who had access to them. I 
20110103145052.317|20110103145054.031|TR0|think that's as specific as I 
20110103145054.031|20110103145055.744|TR0|can get at this point. The first 
20110103145055.744|20110103145057.457|TR0|time we saw them was Thursday.
20110103145057.457|20110103145059.170|TR0|
20110103145059.170|20110103145100.883|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, these are 
20110103145100.883|20110103145102.597|TR0|not, you know, someone on their 
20110103145102.597|20110103145104.310|TR0|cell phone filming a private 
20110103145104.310|20110103145106.023|TR0|conversation with now-Commander 
20110103145106.023|20110103145107.736|TR0|Honors, though this was made 
20110103145107.736|20110103145109.449|TR0|when he was a second-in-command, 
20110103145109.449|20110103145111.162|TR0|or one of the top in 2006, 2007. 
20110103145111.162|20110103145112.876|TR0|He made these. They have plots. 
20110103145112.876|20110103145114.589|TR0|They have - the editing is 
20110103145114.589|20110103145116.302|TR0|excellent on these. They're 
20110103145116.302|20110103145118.015|TR0|actual little films that he 
20110103145118.015|20110103145119.728|TR0|played for the entire ship.
20110103145119.728|20110103145121.441|TR0|
20110103145121.441|20110103145123.155|TR0|>> CORINNE REILLY: That's right. 
20110103145123.155|20110103145124.868|TR0|You know, all aircraft carriers 
20110103145124.868|20110103145126.581|TR0|and most Navy ships have public 
20110103145126.581|20110103145128.294|TR0|affairs offices that are meant 
20110103145128.294|20110103145130.007|TR0|to document and publicize the 
20110103145130.007|20110103145131.720|TR0|good work that the Navy is doing 
20110103145131.720|20110103145133.434|TR0|while they're deployed. So our 
20110103145133.434|20110103145135.147|TR0|understanding, from speaking 
20110103145135.147|20110103145136.860|TR0|with sailors who were on the 
20110103145136.860|20110103145138.573|TR0|ship at the time, is that that's 
20110103145138.573|20110103145140.286|TR0|how he was making these videos. 
20110103145140.286|20110103145142.000|TR0|He was using the equipment in 
20110103145142.000|20110103145143.713|TR0|the public affairs office and 
20110103145143.713|20110103145145.426|TR0|sailors who work in the public 
20110103145145.426|20110103145147.139|TR0|affairs office with know-how in 
20110103145147.139|20110103145148.852|TR0|these kinds of things. But we 
20110103145148.852|20110103145150.565|TR0|are told that he was the one who 
20110103145150.565|20110103145152.279|TR0|was kind of, you know, 
20110103145152.279|20110103145153.992|TR0|masterminding it, coming up with 
20110103145153.992|20110103145155.705|TR0|the ideas, coming up with the 
20110103145155.705|20110103145157.418|TR0|scripts, and then kind of 
20110103145157.418|20110103145159.131|TR0|bringing in help from folks who 
20110103145159.131|20110103145200.844|TR0|had that video expertise.
20110103145200.844|20110103145202.558|TR0|
20110103145202.558|20110103145204.271|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Corinne Reilly, 
20110103145204.271|20110103145205.984|TR0|if you would, describe for us 
20110103145205.984|20110103145207.697|TR0|some of these videos that he 
20110103145207.697|20110103145209.410|TR0|played week after week for the 
20110103145209.410|20110103145211.123|TR0|crew. And explain where they 
20110103145211.123|20110103145212.837|TR0|were when these films were being 
20110103145212.837|20110103145214.550|TR0|played.
20110103145214.550|20110103145216.263|TR0|
20110103145216.263|20110103145217.976|TR0|>> CORINNE REILLY: Well, our 
20110103145217.976|20110103145219.689|TR0|understanding is that they were 
20110103145219.689|20110103145221.403|TR0|played on closed-circuit 
20110103145221.403|20110103145223.116|TR0|ship-wide television. So, 
20110103145223.116|20110103145224.829|TR0|basically, anyone who was in 
20110103145224.829|20110103145226.542|TR0|front of a television on the 
20110103145226.542|20110103145228.255|TR0|ship at the time could have 
20110103145228.255|20110103145229.968|TR0|viewed them. There are ships in, 
20110103145229.968|20110103145231.682|TR0|you know, wardrooms - or, I'm 
20110103145231.682|20110103145233.395|TR0|sorry, there's TVs in wardrooms 
20110103145233.395|20110103145235.108|TR0|and state rooms on the ship, as 
20110103145235.108|20110103145236.821|TR0|well as in dining halls. So, you 
20110103145236.821|20110103145238.534|TR0|know, around dinner time, if all 
20110103145238.534|20110103145240.247|TR0|the sailors are in the mess hall 
20110103145240.247|20110103145241.961|TR0|having a meal, this is our 
20110103145241.961|20110103145243.674|TR0|understanding of when it was 
20110103145243.674|20110103145245.387|TR0|played. We understand that he 
20110103145245.387|20110103145247.100|TR0|made at least a few dozen, 
20110103145247.100|20110103145248.813|TR0|though we're told that not all 
20110103145248.813|20110103145250.526|TR0|of them contain the kind of 
20110103145250.526|20110103145252.240|TR0|material like the ones that we 
20110103145252.240|20110103145253.953|TR0|posted on our website, things 
20110103145253.953|20110103145255.666|TR0|like anti-gay remarks, lots of 
20110103145255.666|20110103145257.379|TR0|sexual jokes. The one that we 
20110103145257.379|20110103145259.092|TR0|put up on our website had, you 
20110103145259.092|20110103145300.806|TR0|know, sailors in the shower, 
20110103145300.806|20110103145302.519|TR0|though it didn't show nudity, 
20110103145302.519|20110103145304.232|TR0|and you could kind of tell that 
20110103145304.232|20110103145305.945|TR0|they knew they were being 
20110103145305.945|20110103145307.658|TR0|filmed, they were pretending 
20110103145307.658|20110103145309.371|TR0|this was part of a skit. But 
20110103145309.371|20110103145311.085|TR0|still, there's definitely a lot 
20110103145311.085|20110103145312.798|TR0|of sexual inferences, sexual 
20110103145312.798|20110103145314.511|TR0|jokes.
20110103145314.511|20110103145316.224|TR0|
20110103145316.224|20110103145317.937|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: There are at 
20110103145317.937|20110103145319.650|TR0|least two other instances of 
20110103145319.650|20110103145321.364|TR0|homophobic slurs. Now-Commander 
20110103145321.364|20110103145323.077|TR0|Honors insults a character he 
20110103145323.077|20110103145324.790|TR0|also plays, a surface warfare 
20110103145324.790|20110103145326.503|TR0|office, or SWO, I think, S-W-O, 
20110103145326.503|20110103145328.216|TR0|SWO -

20110103145329.929|20110103145331.643|TR0|>> CORINNE REILLY: Right.
20110103145331.643|20110103145333.356|TR0|
20110103145333.356|20110103145335.069|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: - and then 
20110103145335.069|20110103145336.782|TR0|introduces a video showing two 
20110103145336.782|20110103145338.495|TR0|women in the same shower. Let's 
20110103145338.495|20110103145340.209|TR0|play this.
20110103145340.209|20110103145341.922|TR0|
20110103145341.922|20110103145343.635|TR0|>> CAPT. OWEN HONORS: Well, I 
20110103145343.635|20110103145345.348|TR0|guess we won't be showing this 
20110103145345.348|20110103145347.061|TR0|to the kids at home, will we 
20110103145347.061|20110103145348.774|TR0|[bleep] gay SWO boy? See? It's 
20110103145348.774|20110103145350.488|TR0|timeless. Finally, let's get to 
20110103145350.488|20110103145352.201|TR0|my favorite topic, and something 
20110103145352.201|20110103145353.914|TR0|foreign to the gay kid over 
20110103145353.914|20110103145355.627|TR0|there: chicks in the shower. 
20110103145355.627|20110103145357.340|TR0|This is certainly the most 
20110103145357.340|20110103145359.053|TR0|popular video of any of the XO 
20110103145359.053|20110103145400.767|TR0|movie videos. It's also the one 
20110103145400.767|20110103145402.480|TR0|that's landed me with the most 
20110103145402.480|20110103145404.193|TR0|complaints. This evening, we've 
20110103145404.193|20110103145405.906|TR0|got some different chicks in the 
20110103145405.906|20110103145407.619|TR0|shower in a clip that was 
20110103145407.619|20110103145409.332|TR0|previously too sensitive to 
20110103145409.332|20110103145411.046|TR0|show. However, we have protected

20110103145426.464|20110103145428.177|TR0|See, you [bleep] up, too, didn't 
20110103145428.177|20110103145429.891|TR0|you? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! People

20110103145443.596|20110103145445.309|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: This is - who 
20110103145445.309|20110103145447.022|TR0|you're watching now or listening 
20110103145447.022|20110103145448.735|TR0|to, though we had to beep it all 
20110103145448.735|20110103145450.449|TR0|the way through - is the 
20110103145450.449|20110103145452.162|TR0|now-commander of the USS 
20110103145452.162|20110103145453.875|TR0|Enterprise that is scheduled to 
20110103145453.875|20110103145455.588|TR0|leave - well, Eugene Fidell, 
20110103145455.588|20110103145457.301|TR0|attorney, lecturer at Yale Law 
20110103145457.301|20110103145459.015|TR0|School, president of the 
20110103145459.015|20110103145500.728|TR0|National Institute of Military 
20110103145500.728|20110103145502.441|TR0|Justice, scheduled to leave 
20110103145502.441|20110103145504.154|TR0|when? And the significance of 
20110103145504.154|20110103145505.867|TR0|these videos?
20110103145505.867|20110103145507.580|TR0|
20110103145507.580|20110103145509.294|TR0|>> EUGENE FIDELL: Well, I'm not 
20110103145509.294|20110103145511.007|TR0|sure when it's scheduled to 
20110103145511.007|20110103145512.720|TR0|leave, but I don't think Captain 
20110103145512.720|20110103145514.433|TR0|Owens - Captain Honors is going 
20110103145514.433|20110103145516.146|TR0|to be on board when she does 
20110103145516.146|20110103145517.859|TR0|sail. These videos are really a 
20110103145517.859|20110103145519.573|TR0|nightmare from the standpoint of 
20110103145519.573|20110103145521.286|TR0|the Navy management. An aircraft 
20110103145521.286|20110103145522.999|TR0|carrier is not a fraternity 
20110103145522.999|20110103145524.712|TR0|house, and the kind of 
20110103145524.712|20110103145526.425|TR0|non-leadership displayed in the 
20110103145526.425|20110103145528.138|TR0|making of these videos is pretty 
20110103145528.138|20110103145529.852|TR0|startling, I must say. Officers 
20110103145529.852|20110103145531.565|TR0|have gotten fired for a lot less 
20110103145531.565|20110103145533.278|TR0|than this.
20110103145533.278|20110103145534.991|TR0|
20110103145534.991|20110103145536.704|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, let's talk 
20110103145536.704|20110103145538.418|TR0|about the chain of command, 
20110103145538.418|20110103145540.131|TR0|because he wasn't in charge of 
20110103145540.131|20110103145541.844|TR0|the ship, this nuclear-powered 
20110103145541.844|20110103145543.557|TR0|aircraft carrier, but they were 
20110103145543.557|20110103145545.270|TR0|playing this on the entire 
20110103145545.270|20110103145546.983|TR0|closed-circuit system, week 
20110103145546.983|20110103145548.697|TR0|after week in 2006, 2007, until 
20110103145548.697|20110103145550.410|TR0|a higher-up, who has now been 
20110103145550.410|20110103145552.123|TR0|promoted, put an end to it, but 
20110103145552.123|20110103145553.836|TR0|did not throw him out. Obviously 
20110103145553.836|20110103145555.549|TR0|he, too, has been promoted, 
20110103145555.549|20110103145557.262|TR0|Captain Honors, to the position 
20110103145557.262|20110103145558.976|TR0|he has now. He's the head of the 
20110103145558.976|20110103145600.689|TR0|ship.
20110103145600.689|20110103145602.402|TR0|
20110103145602.402|20110103145604.115|TR0|>> EUGENE FIDELL: Right, Captain 
20110103145604.115|20110103145605.828|TR0|Honors was the executive 
20110103145605.828|20110103145607.541|TR0|officer, which is the number-two 
20110103145607.541|20110103145609.255|TR0|person on a Naval ship. The 
20110103145609.255|20110103145610.968|TR0|executive officer is the 
20110103145610.968|20110103145612.681|TR0|commanding officer's alter ego, 
20110103145612.681|20110103145614.394|TR0|would naturally stand in for the 
20110103145614.394|20110103145616.107|TR0|commanding officer when the CO 
20110103145616.107|20110103145617.821|TR0|was ashore or away for any 
20110103145617.821|20110103145619.534|TR0|reason. And Captain Honors was a 
20110103145619.534|20110103145621.247|TR0|captain at the time. He's 
20110103145621.247|20110103145622.960|TR0|wearing a captain's rank 
20110103145622.960|20110103145624.673|TR0|insignia. So, you can't palm 
20110103145624.673|20110103145626.386|TR0|this off entirely on the 
20110103145626.386|20110103145628.100|TR0|management. Captain Honors has 
20110103145628.100|20110103145629.813|TR0|got to take responsibility for 
20110103145629.813|20110103145631.526|TR0|this. So he will wind up taking 
20110103145631.526|20110103145633.239|TR0|responsibility for this.
20110103145633.239|20110103145634.952|TR0|
20110103145634.952|20110103145636.665|TR0|Now, with respect to the person 
20110103145636.665|20110103145638.379|TR0|who was commanding officer 
20110103145638.379|20110103145640.092|TR0|during the time these videos 
20110103145640.092|20110103145641.805|TR0|were made in 2006 and 2007, I'm 
20110103145641.805|20110103145643.518|TR0|sure the Navy is going to 
20110103145643.518|20110103145645.231|TR0|investigate this, too, fairly 
20110103145645.231|20110103145646.944|TR0|well to find out what that 
20110103145646.944|20110103145648.658|TR0|officer knew or should have 
20110103145648.658|20110103145650.371|TR0|known about what was going on in 
20110103145650.371|20110103145652.084|TR0|the public affairs office and on 
20110103145652.084|20110103145653.797|TR0|the ship's closed-circuit 
20110103145653.797|20110103145655.510|TR0|television system. And that 
20110103145655.510|20110103145657.224|TR0|officer, I understand, is now a 
20110103145657.224|20110103145658.937|TR0|rear admiral. There is an even 
20110103145658.937|20110103145700.650|TR0|more senior officer in the 
20110103145700.650|20110103145702.363|TR0|picture, and what that officer 
20110103145702.363|20110103145704.076|TR0|knew or should have known will 
20110103145704.076|20110103145705.789|TR0|also be a matter of official 
20110103145705.789|20110103145707.503|TR0|inquiry, I'm sure.
20110103145707.503|20110103145709.216|TR0|
20110103145709.216|20110103145710.929|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Rear Admiral

20110103145716.068|20110103145717.782|TR0|Group during Honors' time as XO, 
20110103145717.782|20110103145719.495|TR0|they couldn't be reached for 
20110103145719.495|20110103145721.208|TR0|Corinne Reilly's piece, but I 
20110103145721.208|20110103145722.921|TR0|wanted to read the Navy 
20110103145722.921|20110103145724.634|TR0|statement about the videos on 
20110103145724.634|20110103145726.348|TR0|Friday. They said, "The videos 
20110103145726.348|20110103145728.061|TR0|created onboard USS Enterprise 
20110103145728.061|20110103145729.774|TR0|in 2006-2007 were not created 
20110103145729.774|20110103145731.487|TR0|with the intent to offend 
20110103145731.487|20110103145733.200|TR0|anyone. The videos were intended 
20110103145733.200|20110103145734.913|TR0|to be humorous skits focusing 
20110103145734.913|20110103145736.627|TR0|the crew's attention on specific 
20110103145736.627|20110103145738.340|TR0|issues such as port visits,

20110103145836.588|20110103145838.301|TR0|thing very humorlessly. It is a 
20110103145838.301|20110103145840.014|TR0|humorless organization on one 
20110103145840.014|20110103145841.727|TR0|level. On another level, it is a
