20110115010007.000|20110115010009.000|TR0|KATHLEEN PARKER, CO-HOST:  Good evening.  
20110115010009.000|20110115010012.000|TR0|I'm Kathleen Parker.

20110115010014.000|20110115010017.000|TR0|ELIOT SPITZER, CO-HOST:  And I'm Eliot 
20110115010017.000|20110115010020.000|TR0|Spitzer.  Welcome to the program.
20110115010020.000|20110115010022.000|TR0|
20110115010022.000|20110115010025.000|TR0|Tonight, we continue our focus on the 
20110115010025.000|20110115010028.000|TR0|investigation into the Tucson shooting.  
20110115010028.000|20110115010030.000|TR0|We are learning more about shooter Jared 
20110115010030.000|20110115010033.000|TR0|Loughner's final actions that tragic 
20110115010033.000|20110115010035.000|TR0|morning and his brush with police just 
20110115010035.000|20110115010038.000|TR0|hours before he opened fire into a crowd.
20110115010038.000|20110115010041.000|TR0|
20110115010041.000|20110115010043.000|TR0|Plus, the latest on the investigation into 
20110115010043.000|20110115010046.000|TR0|the DNA testing of the black bag found 
20110115010046.000|20110115010049.000|TR0|near Loughner's home.
20110115010049.000|20110115010051.000|TR0|
20110115010051.000|20110115010054.000|TR0|But let's start with the questions we'll 
20110115010054.000|20110115010056.000|TR0|drill down on tonight. We are talking to 
20110115010056.000|20110115010059.000|TR0|David Kaczynski, who made the terribly 
20110115010059.000|20110115010102.000|TR0|difficult decision to turn in his brother, 
20110115010102.000|20110115010104.000|TR0|the Unabomber.  David sees eerie 
20110115010104.000|20110115010107.000|TR0|similarities between Loughner and his 
20110115010107.000|20110115010110.000|TR0|brother.  What does that tell us?
20110115010110.000|20110115010112.000|TR0|
20110115010112.000|20110115010115.000|TR0|Plus, given that Loughner's writings and 
20110115010115.000|20110115010117.000|TR0|statements are dark and disturbed, many 
20110115010117.000|20110115010120.000|TR0|wonder why his family didn't seek help for 
20110115010120.000|20110115010123.000|TR0|him.  We'll ask the Unabomber's brother 
20110115010123.000|20110115010125.000|TR0|how difficult it is for a family member to 
20110115010125.000|20110115010128.000|TR0|know when and how to intervene.
20110115010128.000|20110115010131.000|TR0|
20110115010131.000|20110115010133.000|TR0|And one of the shooting victims is 
20110115010133.000|20110115010136.000|TR0|released from the hospital. She describes 
20110115010136.000|20110115010138.000|TR0|it a horrific scene to our Randi Kaye.  
20110115010138.000|20110115010141.000|TR0|How did she stay alive after being shot 
20110115010141.000|20110115010144.000|TR0|twice?
20110115010144.000|20110115010146.000|TR0|
20110115010146.000|20110115010149.000|TR0|PARKER:  Meanwhile, we now have a clearer 
20110115010149.000|20110115010152.000|TR0|picture of Jared Loughner's activities on 
20110115010152.000|20110115010154.000|TR0|the morning of the shooting.  After 
20110115010154.000|20110115010157.000|TR0|spending the night at a Motel 6 about a 
20110115010157.000|20110115010200.000|TR0|mile from his home, Loughner was pulled 
20110115010200.000|20110115010202.000|TR0|over by police for running a red light at 
20110115010202.000|20110115010205.000|TR0|7:30 a.m. Mountain Time. Loughner drove 
20110115010205.000|20110115010207.000|TR0|home and then left on foot with a black 
20110115010207.000|20110115010210.000|TR0|bag which the FBI is now testing for DNA.  
20110115010210.000|20110115010213.000|TR0|He then walked to a Circle K convenience 
20110115010213.000|20110115010215.000|TR0|store where he hailed the cab that brought 
20110115010215.000|20110115010218.000|TR0|him to the Safeway, the site of his attack.
20110115010218.000|20110115010221.000|TR0|
20110115010221.000|20110115010223.000|TR0|PARKER:  On the medical front, 
20110115010223.000|20110115010226.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords' condition remains 
20110115010226.000|20110115010228.000|TR0|critical.  But doctors are still pleased 
20110115010228.000|20110115010231.000|TR0|with her progress. And today, we got our 
20110115010231.000|20110115010234.000|TR0|first information about the condition of 
20110115010234.000|20110115010236.000|TR0|Giffords aide, community outreach 
20110115010236.000|20110115010239.000|TR0|coordinator, Pam Simon.  Simon was shot 
20110115010239.000|20110115010242.000|TR0|twice during the incident.  Today, she was 
20110115010242.000|20110115010244.000|TR0|released from the hospital.
20110115010244.000|20110115010247.000|TR0|
20110115010247.000|20110115010249.000|TR0|And CNN's Randi Kaye managed to get an 
20110115010249.000|20110115010252.000|TR0|interview with her.  Randi joins us now 
20110115010252.000|20110115010255.000|TR0|from Tucson -- Randi.

20110115010303.000|20110115010305.000|TR0|RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  
20110115010305.000|20110115010308.000|TR0|Considering that Pam Simon was shot twice, 
20110115010308.000|20110115010310.000|TR0|she's doing remarkably well.  We asked her 
20110115010310.000|20110115010313.000|TR0|about her injuries today, and I can tell 
20110115010313.000|20110115010316.000|TR0|you that she was shot twice, once in the 
20110115010316.000|20110115010318.000|TR0|wrist and once in chest.  And the bullet 
20110115010318.000|20110115010321.000|TR0|that lodged in her chest actually then 
20110115010321.000|20110115010324.000|TR0|made its way down to her thigh and that is 
20110115010324.000|20110115010326.000|TR0|where it remains.  Doctors chose not to 
20110115010326.000|20110115010329.000|TR0|take that bullet out.
20110115010329.000|20110115010331.000|TR0|
20110115010331.000|20110115010334.000|TR0|She will have full use of her hand, she 
20110115010334.000|20110115010337.000|TR0|told me.  And she also said that after the 
20110115010337.000|20110115010339.000|TR0|surgery, the doctor said to her, "You are 
20110115010339.000|20110115010342.000|TR0|one lucky lady."  While she was lying on 
20110115010342.000|20110115010345.000|TR0|the ground at that Safeway supermarket 
20110115010345.000|20110115010347.000|TR0|after she was shot, she said that she said 
20110115010347.000|20110115010350.000|TR0|to herself, "This is not your day to die."
20110115010350.000|20110115010353.000|TR0|
20110115010353.000|20110115010355.000|TR0|Here's what else she told me about the 
20110115010355.000|20110115010358.000|TR0|shooting.

20110115010406.000|20110115010408.000|TR0|KAYE:  Do you remember when the shot was 
20110115010408.000|20110115010411.000|TR0|fired?
20110115010411.000|20110115010414.000|TR0|
20110115010414.000|20110115010416.000|TR0|PAM SIMON, STAFFER FOR REP. GIFFORDS:  It 
20110115010416.000|20110115010419.000|TR0|happened.  Everything happened, probably 
20110115010419.000|20110115010421.000|TR0|in a matter of seconds.  My feeling is 
20110115010421.000|20110115010424.000|TR0|that he was whirling his, his back was to 
20110115010424.000|20110115010427.000|TR0|me.  I saw the congresswoman go down.  I 
20110115010427.000|20110115010429.000|TR0|saw Ron go down.
20110115010429.000|20110115010432.000|TR0|
20110115010432.000|20110115010435.000|TR0|And then, I think I must have been one of 
20110115010435.000|20110115010437.000|TR0|the next people hit. Because from that 
20110115010437.000|20110115010440.000|TR0|point on, I was -- I was laying on the 
20110115010440.000|20110115010442.000|TR0|ground.

20110115010450.000|20110115010453.000|TR0|KAYE:  Before she started doing community 
20110115010453.000|20110115010456.000|TR0|outreach for the congresswoman, she 
20110115010456.000|20110115010458.000|TR0|actually worked as a teacher.  And she 
20110115010458.000|20110115010501.000|TR0|believes that she crossed over for four 
20110115010501.000|20110115010503.000|TR0|years in middle school and high school 
20110115010503.000|20110115010506.000|TR0|with the suspect in this case, Jared Lee 
20110115010506.000|20110115010509.000|TR0|Loughner, while she was teaching.  He was 
20110115010509.000|20110115010511.000|TR0|a student at both of the schools.  She 
20110115010511.000|20110115010514.000|TR0|told me that she never had any interaction 
20110115010514.000|20110115010517.000|TR0|with him, but she knows that they were in 
20110115010517.000|20110115010519.000|TR0|the same schools for about four years.

20110115010530.000|20110115010532.000|TR0|joining us, Randi.  We appreciate it.

20110115010538.000|20110115010540.000|TR0|made the difficult decision to turn his 
20110115010540.000|20110115010543.000|TR0|brother Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber.  In 
20110115010543.000|20110115010546.000|TR0|September of 1995, when leading papers 
20110115010546.000|20110115010548.000|TR0|publish a manifesto by a serial killer 
20110115010548.000|20110115010551.000|TR0|known as the Unabomber, David Kaczynski 
20110115010551.000|20110115010553.000|TR0|recognized the writing as the work of his 
20110115010553.000|20110115010556.000|TR0|brother Ted.  David eventually told the 
20110115010556.000|20110115010559.000|TR0|FBI and Ted Kaczynski is now serving a 
20110115010559.000|20110115010601.000|TR0|life sentence at a maximum security prison 
20110115010601.000|20110115010604.000|TR0|in Colorado.

20110115010643.000|20110115010646.000|TR0|look when you first heard about the 
20110115010646.000|20110115010649.000|TR0|shooting in Tucson?  Did that bring back 
20110115010649.000|20110115010651.000|TR0|awful memories?  I mean, what was your 
20110115010651.000|20110115010654.000|TR0|visceral response?
20110115010654.000|20110115010656.000|TR0|
20110115010656.000|20110115010659.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  You know, in the first moment 
20110115010659.000|20110115010702.000|TR0|I just felt this awful sense of horror, 
20110115010702.000|20110115010704.000|TR0|understanding that the devastation that 
20110115010704.000|20110115010707.000|TR0|had been caused and, you know, having 
20110115010707.000|20110115010710.000|TR0|worked with murder victim family members 
20110115010710.000|20110115010712.000|TR0|and going through our own experience as a 
20110115010712.000|20110115010715.000|TR0|family, realizing that this wasn't going 
20110115010715.000|20110115010717.000|TR0|to be over in a day, that lives had been 
20110115010717.000|20110115010720.000|TR0|changed forever. And also, there was some 
20110115010720.000|20110115010723.000|TR0|sense of -- a kind of a bit of flashback 
20110115010723.000|20110115010725.000|TR0|to -- events 15 years earlier when my own 
20110115010725.000|20110115010728.000|TR0|brother was the focus of news stories 
20110115010728.000|20110115010731.000|TR0|about violence.  So, it was a difficult 
20110115010731.000|20110115010733.000|TR0|day for me.
20110115010733.000|20110115010736.000|TR0|
20110115010736.000|20110115010739.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, David, let's talk about 
20110115010739.000|20110115010741.000|TR0|your story for a minute. How did you come 
20110115010741.000|20110115010744.000|TR0|to realize your brother, Ted, was the 
20110115010744.000|20110115010746.000|TR0|Unabomber? What led you to turn him in?
20110115010746.000|20110115010749.000|TR0|
20110115010749.000|20110115010752.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  You know, it's so interesting. 
20110115010752.000|20110115010754.000|TR0| It was my wife Linda who actually 
20110115010754.000|20110115010757.000|TR0|suggested it.  And at first, I dismissed 
20110115010757.000|20110115010800.000|TR0|it entirely.  My brother had never been 
20110115010800.000|20110115010802.000|TR0|violent.  We had known for -- maybe at 
20110115010802.000|20110115010805.000|TR0|least five years that he had mental 
20110115010805.000|20110115010807.000|TR0|problems.  But it never had occurred to me 
20110115010807.000|20110115010810.000|TR0|that he would be violent.
20110115010810.000|20110115010813.000|TR0|
20110115010813.000|20110115010815.000|TR0|But Linda urged me to read the manifesto.  
20110115010815.000|20110115010818.000|TR0|When it came out a few weeks later, I sat 
20110115010818.000|20110115010821.000|TR0|there reading the manifesto expecting that 
20110115010821.000|20110115010823.000|TR0|I would be able to tell Linda that it 
20110115010823.000|20110115010826.000|TR0|wasn't Ted who had written it.  And 
20110115010826.000|20110115010828.000|TR0|instead having this awful sinking feeling 
20110115010828.000|20110115010831.000|TR0|and realizing it was just possible that 
20110115010831.000|20110115010834.000|TR0|she might be right.
20110115010834.000|20110115010836.000|TR0|
20110115010836.000|20110115010839.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, you said that you knew for 
20110115010839.000|20110115010842.000|TR0|five years that he had had problems.  Were 
20110115010842.000|20110115010844.000|TR0|you in touch with him during that period?
20110115010844.000|20110115010847.000|TR0|
20110115010847.000|20110115010849.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  Ted had estranged himself from 
20110115010849.000|20110115010852.000|TR0|the family beginning in around 1990.  And, 
20110115010852.000|20110115010855.000|TR0|you know, was actually some letters that I 
20110115010855.000|20110115010857.000|TR0|had received from Ted and shown again to 
20110115010857.000|20110115010900.000|TR0|Linda that were fairly bizarre and I 
20110115010900.000|20110115010903.000|TR0|remember Linda telling me at the time, 
20110115010903.000|20110115010905.000|TR0|"You know, David, your brother is sick.  
20110115010905.000|20110115010908.000|TR0|He's mentally ill.  You realize that, 
20110115010908.000|20110115010911.000|TR0|don't you?"
20110115010911.000|20110115010913.000|TR0|
20110115010913.000|20110115010916.000|TR0|You know, at first I was kind of -- well, 
20110115010916.000|20110115010918.000|TR0|this is Ted.  This is the way he is.  No, 
20110115010918.000|20110115010921.000|TR0|that's normal behavior for Ted.
20110115010921.000|20110115010924.000|TR0|
20110115010924.000|20110115010926.000|TR0|And I remember Linda pointing to a passage 
20110115010926.000|20110115010929.000|TR0|in one of these letters and saying, David, 
20110115010929.000|20110115010932.000|TR0|people who are healthy in their minds 
20110115010932.000|20110115010934.000|TR0|don't write like this.  And so, at that 
20110115010934.000|20110115010937.000|TR0|point, we actually sought a consultation 
20110115010937.000|20110115010939.000|TR0|with a psychiatrist who did confirm 
20110115010939.000|20110115010942.000|TR0|Linda's impression that Ted probably was 
20110115010942.000|20110115010945.000|TR0|suffering from a mental illness.  As it 
20110115010945.000|20110115010947.000|TR0|turned out, it was schizophrenia.
20110115010947.000|20110115010950.000|TR0|
20110115010950.000|20110115010953.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, that's such an important 
20110115010953.000|20110115010955.000|TR0|point.  And, you know, your brother's 
20110115010955.000|20110115010958.000|TR0|isolation is typical and resembles 
20110115010958.000|20110115011000.000|TR0|somewhat the characteristics that we now 
20110115011000.000|20110115011003.000|TR0|know about Loughner, he was retreating 
20110115011003.000|20110115011006.000|TR0|from social environments and seemed to be 
20110115011006.000|20110115011008.000|TR0|isolated, even though he lived with his 
20110115011008.000|20110115011011.000|TR0|family.  At that point, was it -- did you 
20110115011011.000|20110115011014.000|TR0|not think that maybe you should go to your 
20110115011014.000|20110115011016.000|TR0|brother and try to -- I don't know -- do 
20110115011016.000|20110115011019.000|TR0|an intervention or something take him for 
20110115011019.000|20110115011021.000|TR0|help?
20110115011021.000|20110115011024.000|TR0|
20110115011024.000|20110115011027.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  Actually, back in 1990, when 
20110115011027.000|20110115011029.000|TR0|we talked to the psychiatrist, we realized 
20110115011029.000|20110115011032.000|TR0|that we were -- our hands were tied in 
20110115011032.000|20110115011035.000|TR0|some sense.  We asked for advice on what 
20110115011035.000|20110115011037.000|TR0|we might be able to do.  And it was very 
20110115011037.000|20110115011040.000|TR0|clear that Ted did not realize he was ill. 
20110115011040.000|20110115011042.000|TR0| And many people with serious and 
20110115011042.000|20110115011045.000|TR0|persistent mental illness don't understand 
20110115011045.000|20110115011048.000|TR0|that they're sick.  And this was the case 
20110115011048.000|20110115011050.000|TR0|with Ted.
20110115011050.000|20110115011053.000|TR0|
20110115011053.000|20110115011056.000|TR0|So, it would have been a matter of going 
20110115011056.000|20110115011058.000|TR0|to a court of law with legal evidence that 
20110115011058.000|20110115011101.000|TR0|Ted was in imminent danger to himself or 
20110115011101.000|20110115011104.000|TR0|others, not just a hypothetical danger, 
20110115011104.000|20110115011106.000|TR0|but an imminent danger.  And, of course, 
20110115011106.000|20110115011109.000|TR0|we had no evidence of that sort.  So, in 
20110115011109.000|20110115011111.000|TR0|some sense, all we could really do was try 
20110115011111.000|20110115011114.000|TR0|to keep contact with Ted and hope for the 
20110115011114.000|20110115011117.000|TR0|best.
20110115011117.000|20110115011119.000|TR0|
20110115011119.000|20110115011122.000|TR0|SPITZER:  I think, David, that is such a 
20110115011122.000|20110115011125.000|TR0|critically important point you just made.  
20110115011125.000|20110115011127.000|TR0|You were concerned.  You did not have any 
20110115011127.000|20110115011130.000|TR0|precise evidence of imminent risk or 
20110115011130.000|20110115011132.000|TR0|violence, and so, you did not have the 
20110115011132.000|20110115011135.000|TR0|basis, you're saying, to do anything other 
20110115011135.000|20110115011138.000|TR0|than to recommend to him that he do 
20110115011138.000|20110115011140.000|TR0|something.  You couldn't impose upon him 
20110115011140.000|20110115011143.000|TR0|the obligation to get care.
20110115011143.000|20110115011146.000|TR0|
20110115011146.000|20110115011148.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  Yes.  You know, Eliot, I 
20110115011148.000|20110115011151.000|TR0|actually think we need some kind of a 
20110115011151.000|20110115011153.000|TR0|national project that would focus on ways 
20110115011153.000|20110115011156.000|TR0|to connect seriously mentally ill people 
20110115011156.000|20110115011159.000|TR0|with the help that they need.  I mean, we 
20110115011159.000|20110115011201.000|TR0|need to balance civil rights concerns 
20110115011201.000|20110115011204.000|TR0|against compassionate concern for helping 
20110115011204.000|20110115011207.000|TR0|people who may be ill.  And ultimately, 
20110115011207.000|20110115011209.000|TR0|with the public interest we have in 
20110115011209.000|20110115011212.000|TR0|preventing those rare cases when mentally 
20110115011212.000|20110115011214.000|TR0|ill people end up hurting others.
20110115011214.000|20110115011217.000|TR0|
20110115011217.000|20110115011220.000|TR0|I should point out that -- violence in 
20110115011220.000|20110115011222.000|TR0|mentally ill people is actually very, very 
20110115011222.000|20110115011225.000|TR0|low.  In fact, they're more likely to harm 
20110115011225.000|20110115011228.000|TR0|themselves or be victims of crime for that 
20110115011228.000|20110115011230.000|TR0|matter.  My brother is not a poster boy 
20110115011230.000|20110115011233.000|TR0|for mental illness, but I am quite sure 
20110115011233.000|20110115011235.000|TR0|that if he had gotten into treatment, 
20110115011235.000|20110115011238.000|TR0|lives could have been saved.
20110115011238.000|20110115011241.000|TR0|
20110115011241.000|20110115011243.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And at the time when you reached 
20110115011243.000|20110115011246.000|TR0|out to see what your options were, there 
20110115011246.000|20110115011249.000|TR0|were no specific facts and no evidence of 
20110115011249.000|20110115011251.000|TR0|violence on his part at that point.  I 
20110115011251.000|20110115011254.000|TR0|gather that's what you said bound your 
20110115011254.000|20110115011257.000|TR0|hands?
20110115011257.000|20110115011259.000|TR0|
20110115011259.000|20110115011302.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  Absolutely.  He had never been 
20110115011302.000|20110115011304.000|TR0|violent.  And in fact, my worst fear, just 
20110115011304.000|20110115011307.000|TR0|a vague fear was that I might learn 
20110115011307.000|20110115011310.000|TR0|someday that Ted had taken his own life.  
20110115011310.000|20110115011312.000|TR0|I knew he was in pretty deep despair.  I 
20110115011312.000|20110115011315.000|TR0|didn't imagine that that would lead him to 
20110115011315.000|20110115011318.000|TR0|hurt others.
20110115011318.000|20110115011320.000|TR0|
20110115011320.000|20110115011323.000|TR0|PARKER:  One of the very tough things, is 
20110115011323.000|20110115011325.000|TR0|the family, having to live with something 
20110115011325.000|20110115011328.000|TR0|like this.  And you have been through that 
20110115011328.000|20110115011331.000|TR0|in a very personal way, as you say.  So, 
20110115011331.000|20110115011333.000|TR0|what has life been like for you and your 
20110115011333.000|20110115011336.000|TR0|family since this happened?     KACZYNSKI: 
20110115011336.000|20110115011339.000|TR0| I remember in the first to days when we 
20110115011339.000|20110115011341.000|TR0|were -- our house was surrounded by the 
20110115011341.000|20110115011344.000|TR0|media.  And here, I'm thinking of the 
20110115011344.000|20110115011346.000|TR0|Loughner family now.  I have to say, while 
20110115011346.000|20110115011349.000|TR0|the world's attention was focused on us, 
20110115011349.000|20110115011352.000|TR0|we felt like the loneliest people on the 
20110115011352.000|20110115011354.000|TR0|planet probably.  We didn't even have 
20110115011354.000|20110115011357.000|TR0|words for what we were feeling.  We were 
20110115011357.000|20110115011400.000|TR0|truly in shock and in trauma.
20110115011400.000|20110115011402.000|TR0|
20110115011402.000|20110115011405.000|TR0|It took a while for us to stabilize.  I 
20110115011405.000|20110115011407.000|TR0|think one thing that helped us was letters 
20110115011407.000|20110115011410.000|TR0|we began receiving from people around the 
20110115011410.000|20110115011413.000|TR0|country who said that they were praying 
20110115011413.000|20110115011415.000|TR0|for us in some cases.  They said they were 
20110115011415.000|20110115011418.000|TR0|praying for our brother.
20110115011418.000|20110115011421.000|TR0|
20110115011421.000|20110115011423.000|TR0|It was a realization that other families 
20110115011423.000|20110115011426.000|TR0|are vulnerable and that we had struggled 
20110115011426.000|20110115011428.000|TR0|and done best we could under very 
20110115011428.000|20110115011431.000|TR0|difficult circumstances and ultimately, 
20110115011431.000|20110115011434.000|TR0|that we did the right thing in going to 
20110115011434.000|20110115011436.000|TR0|the authorities with our fears.

20110115011439.000|20110115011442.000|TR0|SPITZER:  David, hold on a second, we got 
20110115011442.000|20110115011444.000|TR0|to take a quick break. When we come back, 
20110115011444.000|20110115011447.000|TR0|we'll ask about your advice to Loughner 
20110115011447.000|20110115011450.000|TR0|family.

20110115011503.000|20110115011505.000|TR0|PARKER:  We're back with David Kaczynski.  
20110115011505.000|20110115011508.000|TR0|David is the brother of Unabomber Ted 
20110115011508.000|20110115011511.000|TR0|Kaczynski and knows firsthand about 
20110115011511.000|20110115011513.000|TR0|dealing with a violent, mentally ill 
20110115011513.000|20110115011516.000|TR0|family member.
20110115011516.000|20110115011518.000|TR0|
20110115011518.000|20110115011521.000|TR0|SPITZER:  David, you had not only done 
20110115011521.000|20110115011524.000|TR0|what was unbelievably difficult, to turn 
20110115011524.000|20110115011526.000|TR0|in your own brother, which was an act of 
20110115011526.000|20110115011529.000|TR0|heroism, but you also had to suffer with 
20110115011529.000|20110115011532.000|TR0|the grief and knowledge that he had caused 
20110115011532.000|20110115011534.000|TR0|such harm.  Your position in terms of the 
20110115011534.000|20110115011537.000|TR0|evidence, and what you tried to do is 
20110115011537.000|20110115011539.000|TR0|similar to what we have heard about the 
20110115011539.000|20110115011542.000|TR0|Pima community county professors -- 
20110115011542.000|20110115011545.000|TR0|Community College professors who also 
20110115011545.000|20110115011547.000|TR0|sensed there was something wrong with 
20110115011547.000|20110115011550.000|TR0|Jared Loughner but didn't have enough 
20110115011550.000|20110115011553.000|TR0|evidence of violence to really take it to 
20110115011553.000|20110115011555.000|TR0|the next step.
20110115011555.000|20110115011558.000|TR0|
20110115011558.000|20110115011600.000|TR0|Do you see that analogy?
20110115011600.000|20110115011603.000|TR0|
20110115011603.000|20110115011606.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  I think there's a real 
20110115011606.000|20110115011608.000|TR0|analogy.  Although the more I think about 
20110115011608.000|20110115011611.000|TR0|it, it occurs to me that part of what we 
20110115011611.000|20110115011614.000|TR0|end up doing with mentally ill people when 
20110115011614.000|20110115011616.000|TR0|we have concerns about them is pushing 
20110115011616.000|20110115011619.000|TR0|them out of our communities.  Now, while 
20110115011619.000|20110115011621.000|TR0|it might be appropriate on one level, the 
20110115011621.000|20110115011624.000|TR0|end result is that the person who is 
20110115011624.000|20110115011627.000|TR0|already sort of distancing themselves, 
20110115011627.000|20110115011629.000|TR0|breaking relationships because of their 
20110115011629.000|20110115011632.000|TR0|illness, as a symptom of the illness, are 
20110115011632.000|20110115011635.000|TR0|pushed further into isolation.
20110115011635.000|20110115011637.000|TR0|
20110115011637.000|20110115011640.000|TR0|And again, I think we need to find a way 
20110115011640.000|20110115011643.000|TR0|to compassionately and respectfully 
20110115011643.000|20110115011645.000|TR0|connect people who need help with 
20110115011645.000|20110115011648.000|TR0|available treatments.
20110115011648.000|20110115011650.000|TR0|
20110115011650.000|20110115011653.000|TR0|PARKER:  If you could send a message to 
20110115011653.000|20110115011656.000|TR0|Jared Loughner's parents, what would it be 
20110115011656.000|20110115011658.000|TR0|having lived through all of the traumas 
20110115011658.000|20110115011701.000|TR0|that you lived through?
20110115011701.000|20110115011704.000|TR0|
20110115011704.000|20110115011706.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  I hope they know that there 
20110115011706.000|20110115011709.000|TR0|are people there who are concerned about 
20110115011709.000|20110115011711.000|TR0|them, who are praying for them.  Our 
20110115011711.000|20110115011714.000|TR0|family has been through a very similar and 
20110115011714.000|20110115011717.000|TR0|difficult situation, and in some sense we 
20110115011717.000|20110115011719.000|TR0|know what it's like.  If they would ever 
20110115011719.000|20110115011722.000|TR0|want to talk, I'd be happy to make myself 
20110115011722.000|20110115011725.000|TR0|available.
20110115011725.000|20110115011727.000|TR0|
20110115011727.000|20110115011730.000|TR0|You know, I think it's very unfair that 
20110115011730.000|20110115011732.000|TR0|we're expecting them to talk at this 
20110115011732.000|20110115011735.000|TR0|moment.  I know what it was like to be in 
20110115011735.000|20110115011738.000|TR0|their situation, not having words for my 
20110115011738.000|20110115011740.000|TR0|feelings, being in utter shock, disbelief, 
20110115011740.000|20110115011743.000|TR0|trauma -- also knowing, frankly, how the 
20110115011743.000|20110115011746.000|TR0|media magnifies every little thing -- 
20110115011746.000|20110115011748.000|TR0|piece of information that they can find at 
20110115011748.000|20110115011751.000|TR0|this point.
20110115011751.000|20110115011753.000|TR0|
20110115011753.000|20110115011756.000|TR0|So, I think they simply need to get some 
20110115011756.000|20110115011759.000|TR0|space and we should be giving them some 
20110115011759.000|20110115011801.000|TR0|space at this moment.
20110115011801.000|20110115011804.000|TR0|
20110115011804.000|20110115011807.000|TR0|SPITZER:  In an odd or perhaps not so odd 
20110115011807.000|20110115011809.000|TR0|coincidence, your brother and Jared 
20110115011809.000|20110115011812.000|TR0|Loughner actually will have the same 
20110115011812.000|20110115011815.000|TR0|defense attorney.  Put aside whether 
20110115011815.000|20110115011817.000|TR0|there's going to be a finding of guilt, 
20110115011817.000|20110115011820.000|TR0|what do you think the appropriate sentence 
20110115011820.000|20110115011822.000|TR0|or sanction should be in the case of Jared 
20110115011822.000|20110115011825.000|TR0|Loughner?
20110115011825.000|20110115011828.000|TR0|
20110115011828.000|20110115011830.000|TR0|KACZYNSKI:  You know, Eliot, I've worked 
20110115011830.000|20110115011833.000|TR0|against the death penalty for quite a long 
20110115011833.000|20110115011836.000|TR0|time, especially since my brother's trial 
20110115011836.000|20110115011838.000|TR0|ended.  My brother did escape the death 
20110115011838.000|20110115011841.000|TR0|penalty.  I think it would have been very 
20110115011841.000|20110115011843.000|TR0|unjust if he had been sentenced to death 
20110115011843.000|20110115011846.000|TR0|and executed because he has a severe 
20110115011846.000|20110115011849.000|TR0|mental illness.  I think that would be the 
20110115011849.000|20110115011851.000|TR0|first thing to understand, that our legal 
20110115011851.000|20110115011854.000|TR0|system really is not designed to deal with 
20110115011854.000|20110115011857.000|TR0|defendants who have serious mental 
20110115011857.000|20110115011859.000|TR0|illness.  We presume that a defendant in 
20110115011859.000|20110115011902.000|TR0|such a case has, is rational, that they 
20110115011902.000|20110115011904.000|TR0|have a grasp, a firm grasp of their own 
20110115011904.000|20110115011907.000|TR0|self-interest.  And when the defendant is 
20110115011907.000|20110115011910.000|TR0|seriously mentally ill, that's very 
20110115011910.000|20110115011912.000|TR0|unlikely to be true.
20110115011912.000|20110115011915.000|TR0|
20110115011915.000|20110115011918.000|TR0|I think we really need to learn more about 
20110115011918.000|20110115011920.000|TR0|the severity of the illness here, the 
20110115011920.000|20110115011923.000|TR0|explicit diagnosis, before we can talk 
20110115011923.000|20110115011925.000|TR0|about whether Jared Loughner is competent 
20110115011925.000|20110115011928.000|TR0|or not.  But I think there is some 
20110115011928.000|20110115011931.000|TR0|suggestion that he may be even legally 
20110115011931.000|20110115011933.000|TR0|insane and not competent to stand trial.  
20110115011933.000|20110115011936.000|TR0|But again, we need more information.
20110115011936.000|20110115011939.000|TR0|
20110115011939.000|20110115011941.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.  David Kaczynski, 
20110115011941.000|20110115011944.000|TR0|thank you so much for joining us in this

20110115011954.000|20110115011957.000|TR0|Coming up: Tucson has been the big story.  
20110115011957.000|20110115012000.000|TR0|But the world beyond has continued to 
20110115012000.000|20110115012002.000|TR0|spin.  Ben Stein thinks this is no time 
20110115012002.000|20110115012005.000|TR0|for America to retreat from its 
20110115012005.000|20110115012008.000|TR0|obligations and we'll ask him about that.  
20110115012008.000|20110115012010.000|TR0|Stay tuned.

20110115012018.000|20110115012021.000|TR0|SPITZER:  As all of us focus our attention 
20110115012021.000|20110115012023.000|TR0|on the massacre in Arizona this week, U.S. 
20110115012023.000|20110115012026.000|TR0|leaders were outside our borders, panning 
20110115012026.000|20110115012029.000|TR0|out to hot spots around the world.
20110115012029.000|20110115012031.000|TR0|
20110115012031.000|20110115012034.000|TR0|Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in 
20110115012034.000|20110115012036.000|TR0|the Middle East, telling leaders, quote, 
20110115012036.000|20110115012039.000|TR0|"to listen to their people" and warning 
20110115012039.000|20110115012042.000|TR0|the region and again, I quote, "sink into 
20110115012042.000|20110115012044.000|TR0|the sand if extremism is not stopped."
20110115012044.000|20110115012047.000|TR0|
20110115012047.000|20110115012050.000|TR0|Vice President Joe Biden made an 
20110115012050.000|20110115012052.000|TR0|unannounced trip to Afghanistan and met 
20110115012052.000|20110115012055.000|TR0|with President Hamid Karzai.
20110115012055.000|20110115012057.000|TR0|
20110115012057.000|20110115012100.000|TR0|And, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates 
20110115012100.000|20110115012103.000|TR0|wrapped up a five-day trip urging North 
20110115012103.000|20110115012105.000|TR0|Korea to end belligerent behavior and 
20110115012105.000|20110115012108.000|TR0|cooperate with the international 
20110115012108.000|20110115012111.000|TR0|community.  Last week, Gates announced the 
20110115012111.000|20110115012113.000|TR0|defense budget will be cut $78 billion 
20110115012113.000|20110115012116.000|TR0|over five years.  It's the biggest story 
20110115012116.000|20110115012118.000|TR0|we haven't been talking about this week.
20110115012118.000|20110115012121.000|TR0|
20110115012121.000|20110115012124.000|TR0|And our next guest thinks slashing the 
20110115012124.000|20110115012126.000|TR0|military budget could prove disastrous.  
20110115012126.000|20110115012129.000|TR0|Ben Stein joins us tonight from Los 
20110115012129.000|20110115012132.000|TR0|Angeles.
20110115012132.000|20110115012134.000|TR0|
20110115012134.000|20110115012137.000|TR0|Welcome back, Ben.  Always great to have 
20110115012137.000|20110115012139.000|TR0|you on the show.
20110115012139.000|20110115012142.000|TR0|
20110115012142.000|20110115012145.000|TR0|BEN STEIN, ECONOMIST:  Always an honor to 
20110115012145.000|20110115012147.000|TR0|be here, Eliot.
20110115012147.000|20110115012150.000|TR0|
20110115012150.000|20110115012153.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, thank you.  Now, let me 
20110115012153.000|20110115012155.000|TR0|frame the question for you this way.  
20110115012155.000|20110115012158.000|TR0|Everybody from the Bowles-Simpson 
20110115012158.000|20110115012201.000|TR0|bipartisan report about closing the 
20110115012201.000|20110115012203.000|TR0|deficit, to the secretary of defense is 
20110115012203.000|20110115012206.000|TR0|now saying, yes, we have to pare back on 
20110115012206.000|20110115012208.000|TR0|defense spending -- you are one of the few 
20110115012208.000|20110115012211.000|TR0|voices out there maybe saying, no, don't 
20110115012211.000|20110115012214.000|TR0|do it at all.  Why not? Why not cut the 
20110115012214.000|20110115012216.000|TR0|defense budget?
20110115012216.000|20110115012219.000|TR0|
20110115012219.000|20110115012222.000|TR0|STEIN:  Because we are an under-defended, 
20110115012222.000|20110115012224.000|TR0|under-armed country. We have a defense 
20110115012224.000|20110115012227.000|TR0|budget which represents roughly 5 percent 
20110115012227.000|20110115012229.000|TR0|of the GDP.  Included in that is an 
20110115012229.000|20110115012232.000|TR0|enormous amount for military pensions, 
20110115012232.000|20110115012235.000|TR0|military health care, housing, 
20110115012235.000|20110115012237.000|TR0|transportation.
20110115012237.000|20110115012240.000|TR0|
20110115012240.000|20110115012243.000|TR0|We have a very small number of women and 
20110115012243.000|20110115012245.000|TR0|men under arms who are actually ready to 
20110115012245.000|20110115012248.000|TR0|take part in any combat.  Just fighting a 
20110115012248.000|20110115012250.000|TR0|few thousand guerrillas in Afghanistan, 
20110115012250.000|20110115012253.000|TR0|basically, garrison duty, not entirely, 
20110115012253.000|20110115012256.000|TR0|but basically garrison duty in Iraq is 
20110115012256.000|20110115012258.000|TR0|using up most of our actual combat troops.
20110115012258.000|20110115012301.000|TR0|
20110115012301.000|20110115012304.000|TR0|If there were to be an invasion of the 
20110115012304.000|20110115012306.000|TR0|South Korean peninsula by North Korea, 
20110115012306.000|20110115012309.000|TR0|what would we do?  If China decided to 
20110115012309.000|20110115012311.000|TR0|invade Taiwan, what would we do?  If Iran 
20110115012311.000|20110115012314.000|TR0|decided to invade Saudi Arabia, what would 
20110115012314.000|20110115012317.000|TR0|we do?
20110115012317.000|20110115012319.000|TR0|
20110115012319.000|20110115012322.000|TR0|We are an under-armed country.  And we can 
20110115012322.000|20110115012325.000|TR0|easily afford to be better armed.  And it 
20110115012325.000|20110115012327.000|TR0|is a myth that countries disappear because 
20110115012327.000|20110115012330.000|TR0|they spend on defense.  I defy any 
20110115012330.000|20110115012332.000|TR0|historian to show me a country that 
20110115012332.000|20110115012335.000|TR0|disappeared because it spent too much on 
20110115012335.000|20110115012338.000|TR0|defense.
20110115012338.000|20110115012340.000|TR0|
20110115012340.000|20110115012343.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, let me first -- just to, 
20110115012343.000|20110115012346.000|TR0|sort of, put some numbers up on the screen 
20110115012346.000|20110115012348.000|TR0|so the public can see.  Let's put up a 
20110115012348.000|20110115012351.000|TR0|chart that shows, and these are real 
20110115012351.000|20110115012354.000|TR0|dollars, our defense spending over the 
20110115012354.000|20110115012356.000|TR0|past couple years.  It is really, in real 
20110115012356.000|20110115012359.000|TR0|dollars.  And these are real dollars, 
20110115012359.000|20110115012401.000|TR0|inflation adjusted at its highest level 
20110115012401.000|20110115012404.000|TR0|ever, over about, you know, as you can 
20110115012404.000|20110115012407.000|TR0|see, that $700 billion a year, which is 55 
20110115012407.000|20110115012409.000|TR0|percent of the discretionary budget.  And 
20110115012409.000|20110115012412.000|TR0|this doesn't include the precise 
20110115012412.000|20110115012415.000|TR0|allocations for Afghanistan and, the Iraq 
20110115012415.000|20110115012417.000|TR0|wars, which are done separate.
20110115012417.000|20110115012420.000|TR0|
20110115012420.000|20110115012422.000|TR0|So, you can see that steep increase, Ben.  
20110115012422.000|20110115012425.000|TR0|We've been spending a lot more.  You don't 
20110115012425.000|20110115012428.000|TR0|think there's any waste in there that we 
20110115012428.000|20110115012430.000|TR0|can pare back on?
20110115012430.000|20110115012433.000|TR0|
20110115012433.000|20110115012436.000|TR0|STEIN:  Oh, I am positive there's waste in 
20110115012436.000|20110115012438.000|TR0|there.  By the way, I think, with all due 
20110115012438.000|20110115012441.000|TR0|respect, Eliot, those numbers might 
20110115012441.000|20110115012443.000|TR0|include a good chunk of the Afghanistan 
20110115012443.000|20110115012446.000|TR0|and Iraq war spending.  I think the basic 
20110115012446.000|20110115012449.000|TR0|military budget is around $560 billion 
20110115012449.000|20110115012451.000|TR0|before you put in those added war costs.
20110115012451.000|20110115012454.000|TR0|
20110115012454.000|20110115012457.000|TR0|But, if you showed the graph going back a 
20110115012457.000|20110115012459.000|TR0|little farther, say, beginning in 1940, it 
20110115012459.000|20110115012502.000|TR0|would look entirely different.  If you 
20110115012502.000|20110115012504.000|TR0|show the graph as percent of GDP, it would 
20110115012504.000|20110115012507.000|TR0|look completely different.
20110115012507.000|20110115012510.000|TR0|
20110115012510.000|20110115012512.000|TR0|The real -- the real question is not how 
20110115012512.000|20110115012515.000|TR0|many dollars are we spending or if there's 
20110115012515.000|20110115012518.000|TR0|waste, but could we defend our vital 
20110115012518.000|20110115012520.000|TR0|interests around the world.  I mean, the 
20110115012520.000|20110115012523.000|TR0|absolute number of dollars being spent is 
20110115012523.000|20110115012525.000|TR0|meaningless.  How many men do you think 
20110115012525.000|20110115012528.000|TR0|the United States has under arms right now 
20110115012528.000|20110115012531.000|TR0|who can respond to a crisis in this world 
20110115012531.000|20110115012533.000|TR0|where there are 6 billion or 7 billion 
20110115012533.000|20110115012536.000|TR0|people?  How many soldiers, marines, do 
20110115012536.000|20110115012539.000|TR0|you think are actually ready to go into 
20110115012539.000|20110115012541.000|TR0|combat right now?
20110115012541.000|20110115012544.000|TR0|
20110115012544.000|20110115012547.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, Ben, I think you're 
20110115012547.000|20110115012549.000|TR0|correct that the issue isn't: are we 
20110115012549.000|20110115012552.000|TR0|spending more?  The question is: is it 
20110115012552.000|20110115012554.000|TR0|sufficient for the mission when it comes 
20110115012554.000|20110115012557.000|TR0|to defense.  I think you and I would agree 
20110115012557.000|20110115012600.000|TR0|the premise: you've got to do what is 
20110115012600.000|20110115012602.000|TR0|necessary to accomplish the mission.
20110115012602.000|20110115012605.000|TR0|
20110115012605.000|20110115012608.000|TR0|The mission here is protecting us.  And I 
20110115012608.000|20110115012610.000|TR0|think from Bowles- Simpson to the 
20110115012610.000|20110115012613.000|TR0|secretary of defense, what they're saying 
20110115012613.000|20110115012615.000|TR0|is that what we should be able to do is 
20110115012615.000|20110115012618.000|TR0|withdraw, for instance, the 150,000 armed 
20110115012618.000|20110115012621.000|TR0|servicemen and women who are in Europe 
20110115012621.000|20110115012623.000|TR0|who've been there since World War II.  
20110115012623.000|20110115012626.000|TR0|That would save a great deal of both money 
20110115012626.000|20110115012629.000|TR0|and give us the resources you're talking 
20110115012629.000|20110115012631.000|TR0|about to deal with the eventuality of a 
20110115012631.000|20110115012634.000|TR0|Korean crisis, or any -- something that 
20110115012634.000|20110115012636.000|TR0|might erupt elsewhere in the world.  And 
20110115012636.000|20110115012639.000|TR0|they're saying if we did that by pulling 
20110115012639.000|20110115012642.000|TR0|back from missions that are no longer 
20110115012642.000|20110115012644.000|TR0|necessary, then we could save and be 
20110115012644.000|20110115012647.000|TR0|sufficient.
20110115012647.000|20110115012650.000|TR0|
20110115012650.000|20110115012652.000|TR0|Does that logic make sense to you?  Troops 
20110115012652.000|20110115012655.000|TR0|in Europe --
20110115012655.000|20110115012657.000|TR0|
20110115012657.000|20110115012700.000|TR0|STEIN:  That's tremendous amount -- Eliot, 
20110115012700.000|20110115012703.000|TR0|that makes tremendous logical sense.  And 
20110115012703.000|20110115012705.000|TR0|for some reason, we do not seem to want to 
20110115012705.000|20110115012708.000|TR0|take men and women out of the European 
20110115012708.000|20110115012711.000|TR0|theater.  I'm not quite sure why.
20110115012711.000|20110115012713.000|TR0|
20110115012713.000|20110115012716.000|TR0|I agree we could take them out of Germany. 
20110115012716.000|20110115012719.000|TR0| Well, we don't have that many in Germany 
20110115012719.000|20110115012721.000|TR0|anymore.
20110115012721.000|20110115012724.000|TR0|
20110115012724.000|20110115012726.000|TR0|Anyway, look, the question is this: we 
20110115012726.000|20110115012729.000|TR0|have 38,500 roughly men and women in 
20110115012729.000|20110115012732.000|TR0|Korea.  Many of whom are not in combat 
20110115012732.000|20110115012734.000|TR0|roles.  The North Koreans have an army in 
20110115012734.000|20110115012737.000|TR0|excess of 700,000.
20110115012737.000|20110115012740.000|TR0|
20110115012740.000|20110115012742.000|TR0|What would we do if one day Kim Jong-il 
20110115012742.000|20110115012745.000|TR0|woke up, got tired of watching his 
20110115012745.000|20110115012747.000|TR0|pornography for that day and said, let's 
20110115012747.000|20110115012750.000|TR0|go to war?  What do we do then?
20110115012750.000|20110115012753.000|TR0|
20110115012753.000|20110115012755.000|TR0|What do we do if one day, Ahmadinejad has 
20110115012755.000|20110115012758.000|TR0|one of his customary nervous breakdowns 
20110115012758.000|20110115012801.000|TR0|and decides he's going to invade Saudi 
20110115012801.000|20110115012803.000|TR0|Arabia? What do we do to protect our vital 
20110115012803.000|20110115012806.000|TR0|interest short of using nuclear weapons, 
20110115012806.000|20110115012808.000|TR0|which nobody wants to use?  What would be 
20110115012808.000|20110115012811.000|TR0|better than to spend a little more and be 
20110115012811.000|20110115012814.000|TR0|sure we are safe?
20110115012814.000|20110115012816.000|TR0|
20110115012816.000|20110115012819.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Look, I think the argument from 
20110115012819.000|20110115012822.000|TR0|a military perspective is that if we were 
20110115012822.000|20110115012824.000|TR0|to take back the resources that we're 
20110115012824.000|20110115012827.000|TR0|spending where we don't them, such as 
20110115012827.000|20110115012829.000|TR0|troops in Europe.  Many overseas missions 
20110115012829.000|20110115012832.000|TR0|that are simply not necessary, we have the 
20110115012832.000|20110115012835.000|TR0|battleships.  We still -- we have, I think 
20110115012835.000|20110115012837.000|TR0|it is right now, 11 aircraft carrier task 
20110115012837.000|20110115012840.000|TR0|forces and they're planning to build a 
20110115012840.000|20110115012843.000|TR0|12th when many think we only need 10.  So 
20110115012843.000|20110115012845.000|TR0|we can make adjustments and still project 
20110115012845.000|20110115012848.000|TR0|all the military power we need.
20110115012848.000|20110115012850.000|TR0|
20110115012850.000|20110115012853.000|TR0|Many people feel, for instance, that 
20110115012853.000|20110115012856.000|TR0|Afghanistan is simply not a war that 
20110115012856.000|20110115012858.000|TR0|should be fought.  That would save only 
20110115012858.000|20110115012901.000|TR0|the $100 billion- plus, but also the 
20110115012901.000|20110115012904.000|TR0|enormity of the lives that are being lost. 
20110115012904.000|20110115012906.000|TR0| And then reallocate those resources to 
20110115012906.000|20110115012909.000|TR0|the sorts of missions you're talking 
20110115012909.000|20110115012912.000|TR0|about.  And we can still do it tightening 
20110115012912.000|20110115012914.000|TR0|down on the budget and fulfill the mission 
20110115012914.000|20110115012917.000|TR0|you're talking about.  And I think that's 
20110115012917.000|20110115012919.000|TR0|the balance many of us believe is 
20110115012919.000|20110115012922.000|TR0|appropriate.
20110115012922.000|20110115012925.000|TR0|
20110115012925.000|20110115012927.000|TR0|STEIN:  But you are making hypothetical 
20110115012927.000|20110115012930.000|TR0|assumptions, Eliot, which are a bit 
20110115012930.000|20110115012933.000|TR0|farfetched.  One of which is that we're 
20110115012933.000|20110115012935.000|TR0|going to pull out of Afghanistan in any 
20110115012935.000|20110115012938.000|TR0|large numbers any time soon.  Look, we've 
20110115012938.000|20110115012940.000|TR0|got quite a sizable force in Afghanistan 
20110115012940.000|20110115012943.000|TR0|now, between 150,000 and 220,000 men and 
20110115012943.000|20110115012946.000|TR0|women depending on how you count it.  And 
20110115012946.000|20110115012948.000|TR0|we are still not winning that war.
20110115012948.000|20110115012951.000|TR0|
20110115012951.000|20110115012954.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well --
20110115012954.000|20110115012956.000|TR0|
20110115012956.000|20110115012959.000|TR0|STEIN:  So, the question whether we're 
20110115012959.000|20110115013001.000|TR0|going to pull out any time soon in any 
20110115013001.000|20110115013004.000|TR0|large numbers seems to be extremely 
20110115013004.000|20110115013007.000|TR0|dubious.  If we could streamline 
20110115013007.000|20110115013009.000|TR0|everything, if we could get an ironclad 
20110115013009.000|20110115013012.000|TR0|promise from Mr. Putin that he's going to 
20110115013012.000|20110115013015.000|TR0|never invade Western Europe, we could move 
20110115013015.000|20110115013017.000|TR0|things around.  We don't have those 
20110115013017.000|20110115013020.000|TR0|promises.
20110115013020.000|20110115013022.000|TR0|
20110115013022.000|20110115013025.000|TR0|We saw Mr. Putin invade Georgia just a 
20110115013025.000|20110115013028.000|TR0|couple of years ago, or a year and a half 
20110115013028.000|20110115013030.000|TR0|ago.  We don't know he's not going to 
20110115013030.000|20110115013033.000|TR0|invade Ukraine next.  We don't know what 
20110115013033.000|20110115013036.000|TR0|he's going to do there.  There's some 
20110115013036.000|20110115013038.000|TR0|reason for U.S. troops to be in Europe.
20110115013038.000|20110115013041.000|TR0|
20110115013041.000|20110115013043.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Ben --
20110115013043.000|20110115013046.000|TR0|
20110115013046.000|20110115013049.000|TR0|STEIN:  The question is: why should we cut 
20110115013049.000|20110115013051.000|TR0|it thin?
20110115013051.000|20110115013054.000|TR0|
20110115013054.000|20110115013057.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Look, I understand your 
20110115013057.000|20110115013059.000|TR0|perspective.  I disagree that the Defense 
20110115013059.000|20110115013102.000|TR0|Department could not simultaneously 
20110115013102.000|20110115013105.000|TR0|fulfill that mission and be slimmed down.
20110115013105.000|20110115013107.000|TR0|
20110115013107.000|20110115013110.000|TR0|But let me ask you this question: doesn't 
20110115013110.000|20110115013112.000|TR0|our fiscal health also have a direct 
20110115013112.000|20110115013115.000|TR0|impact upon our long term security?  And 
20110115013115.000|20110115013118.000|TR0|doesn't the need to close the budget 
20110115013118.000|20110115013120.000|TR0|deficit in the long run require that we 
20110115013120.000|20110115013123.000|TR0|re- evaluate virtually every piece of 
20110115013123.000|20110115013126.000|TR0|spending in the federal budget, including 
20110115013126.000|20110115013128.000|TR0|defense spending?
20110115013128.000|20110115013131.000|TR0|
20110115013131.000|20110115013133.000|TR0|STEIN:  No, it doesn't.  You are an 
20110115013133.000|20110115013136.000|TR0|incredibly intelligent and a very 
20110115013136.000|20110115013139.000|TR0|well-educated gentleman.  I'd like you to 
20110115013139.000|20110115013141.000|TR0|give me an example of a country in the 
20110115013141.000|20110115013144.000|TR0|industrial era that disappeared or subject 
20110115013144.000|20110115013147.000|TR0|to foreign domination because its budget 
20110115013147.000|20110115013149.000|TR0|deficits were too large.  There are none 
20110115013149.000|20110115013152.000|TR0|that I could find.  If you can find them, 
20110115013152.000|20110115013154.000|TR0|more power to you.
20110115013154.000|20110115013157.000|TR0|
20110115013157.000|20110115013200.000|TR0|So, countries disappear because they take 
20110115013200.000|20110115013202.000|TR0|on commitments or they lose their elite 
20110115013202.000|20110115013205.000|TR0|status in the world because they take on 
20110115013205.000|20110115013208.000|TR0|commitments they can no longer fulfill.  I 
20110115013208.000|20110115013210.000|TR0|would give you the example of Russia or 
20110115013210.000|20110115013213.000|TR0|Soviet Union.  I'd give you the example of 
20110115013213.000|20110115013215.000|TR0|Great Britain.  But countries don't 
20110115013215.000|20110115013218.000|TR0|disappear because their fiscal policies 
20110115013218.000|20110115013221.000|TR0|are poor.  We can fix the policies simply 
20110115013221.000|20110115013223.000|TR0|by raising taxes at some point.  And we 
20110115013223.000|20110115013226.000|TR0|can fix the fiscal policies simply by 
20110115013226.000|20110115013229.000|TR0|raising taxes at some point.  I mean, the 
20110115013229.000|20110115013231.000|TR0|question for us Republicans is do we want 
20110115013231.000|20110115013234.000|TR0|more defense or higher taxes.  For me, 
20110115013234.000|20110115013236.000|TR0|I'll take the higher taxes any day.
20110115013236.000|20110115013239.000|TR0|
20110115013239.000|20110115013242.000|TR0|Look, we had higher taxes and much, much 
20110115013242.000|20110115013244.000|TR0|higher defense spending in the Eisenhower 
20110115013244.000|20110115013247.000|TR0|era and we had fantastic prosperity.  
20110115013247.000|20110115013250.000|TR0|Maybe we could do the same.
20110115013250.000|20110115013252.000|TR0|
20110115013252.000|20110115013255.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Look, Ben, our time is up.  But 
20110115013255.000|20110115013258.000|TR0|we love having you on the show.  We're 
20110115013258.000|20110115013300.000|TR0|going to have you on over and over so 
20110115013300.000|20110115013303.000|TR0|we'll have a chance to continue this, 
20110115013303.000|20110115013305.000|TR0|because you and I -- we'll do intellectual 
20110115013305.000|20110115013308.000|TR0|combat on this issue.  But I love hearing 
20110115013308.000|20110115013311.000|TR0|your voice and your perspective on this.  
20110115013311.000|20110115013313.000|TR0|Thanks for being with us.
20110115013313.000|20110115013316.000|TR0|
20110115013316.000|20110115013319.000|TR0|STEIN:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
20110115013319.000|20110115013321.000|TR0|
20110115013321.000|20110115013324.000|TR0|SPITZER:  When we return, how this week of 
20110115013324.000|20110115013326.000|TR0|American tragedy is viewed from overseas.  
20110115013326.000|20110115013329.000|TR0|We'll be right back.
20110115013329.000|20110115013332.000|TR0|

20110115013334.000|20110115013337.000|TR0|
20110115013337.000|20110115013340.000|TR0|SPITZER:  We've talked a lot this week 
20110115013340.000|20110115013342.000|TR0|about the societal implications and 
20110115013342.000|20110115013345.000|TR0|political ramifications of the deadly 
20110115013345.000|20110115013347.000|TR0|shooting in Arizona.  But one perspective 
20110115013347.000|20110115013350.000|TR0|we haven't heard is from a voice from 
20110115013350.000|20110115013353.000|TR0|overseas.

20110115013358.000|20110115013401.000|TR0|commentary on the U.S. that is read around 
20110115013401.000|20110115013403.000|TR0|the world and Europeans praised him as an 
20110115013403.000|20110115013406.000|TR0|intellectual superstar.  His latest 
20110115013406.000|20110115013408.000|TR0|international best seller, "Public 
20110115013408.000|20110115013411.000|TR0|Enemies," is an exchange of letters with 
20110115013411.000|20110115013414.000|TR0|fellow writer Michel Houellebecq and it 
20110115013414.000|20110115013416.000|TR0|was just released in America.
20110115013416.000|20110115013419.000|TR0|
20110115013419.000|20110115013422.000|TR0|Welcome, Bernard-Henri.
20110115013422.000|20110115013424.000|TR0|
20110115013424.000|20110115013427.000|TR0|BERNARD-HENRI LEVY, FRENCH INTELLECTUAL:  
20110115013427.000|20110115013430.000|TR0|Thank you.
20110115013430.000|20110115013432.000|TR0|
20110115013432.000|20110115013435.000|TR0|SPITZER:  The American love for guns, I 
20110115013435.000|20110115013437.000|TR0|think those from Europe look at the way we 
20110115013437.000|20110115013440.000|TR0|deal with this gun issue kind of an 
20110115013440.000|20110115013443.000|TR0|amazement.  How do you respond to it?
20110115013443.000|20110115013445.000|TR0|
20110115013445.000|20110115013448.000|TR0|LEVY:  I respond, I don't understand.  Do 
20110115013448.000|20110115013451.000|TR0|you know that since '68, since the murder 
20110115013451.000|20110115013453.000|TR0|of Martin Luther King, you had more than 
20110115013453.000|20110115013456.000|TR0|one million victims of average citizens 
20110115013456.000|20110115013458.000|TR0|with guns, like poor little Christina 
20110115013458.000|20110115013501.000|TR0|Green, born on the very day of September 
20110115013501.000|20110115013504.000|TR0|11.  And then because guns are in free 
20110115013504.000|20110115013506.000|TR0|sale.  I can go, when I go out of here, I 
20110115013506.000|20110115013509.000|TR0|can go in a shop and buy just filling a 
20110115013509.000|20110115013512.000|TR0|little form.  I know exactly how it 
20110115013512.000|20110115013514.000|TR0|happens.  I did it when I wrote this book. 
20110115013514.000|20110115013517.000|TR0| I tried.
20110115013517.000|20110115013519.000|TR0|
20110115013519.000|20110115013522.000|TR0|PARKER:  You bought a gun in the United 
20110115013522.000|20110115013525.000|TR0|States?     LEVY:  No, I tried.  I tried.  
20110115013525.000|20110115013527.000|TR0|I did not, of course.  I investigated how 
20110115013527.000|20110115013530.000|TR0|it can be done.  I asked, I made my 
20110115013530.000|20110115013533.000|TR0|inquiry.  I want to buy a gun, what should 
20110115013533.000|20110115013535.000|TR0|I do?  Just fill a form.  Just give a few 
20110115013535.000|20110115013538.000|TR0|information.  This is crazy.  It is a 
20110115013538.000|20110115013540.000|TR0|country, I think you are number -- I don't 
20110115013540.000|20110115013543.000|TR0|know, number high in the countries where 
20110115013543.000|20110115013546.000|TR0|you have free guns.  So how don't you want 
20110115013546.000|20110115013548.000|TR0|to have such tragedy as the one you had in 
20110115013548.000|20110115013551.000|TR0|Arizona and other Christina Greens.  You 
20110115013551.000|20110115013554.000|TR0|will have more.
20110115013554.000|20110115013556.000|TR0|
20110115013556.000|20110115013559.000|TR0|PARKER:  What about --
20110115013559.000|20110115013601.000|TR0|
20110115013601.000|20110115013604.000|TR0|LEVY:  This problem has to be controlled.
20110115013604.000|20110115013607.000|TR0|
20110115013607.000|20110115013609.000|TR0|PARKER:  But what about the argument that 
20110115013609.000|20110115013612.000|TR0|criminals will still be able to get guns 
20110115013612.000|20110115013615.000|TR0|and only law-abiding citizens won't have 
20110115013615.000|20110115013617.000|TR0|them?
20110115013617.000|20110115013620.000|TR0|
20110115013620.000|20110115013623.000|TR0|LEVY:  The guy who committed this crime 
20110115013623.000|20110115013625.000|TR0|was not a professional criminal.  If guns 
20110115013625.000|20110115013628.000|TR0|had not been so easily bought, he would 
20110115013628.000|20110115013630.000|TR0|not have committed the crime.  And 
20110115013630.000|20110115013633.000|TR0|Christina Green would be still alive.  And 
20110115013633.000|20110115013636.000|TR0|we would not have to pray for Christina 
20110115013636.000|20110115013638.000|TR0|Green tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. 
20110115013638.000|20110115013641.000|TR0| You know that.
20110115013641.000|20110115013644.000|TR0|
20110115013644.000|20110115013646.000|TR0|Of course, criminals have always guns.  In 
20110115013646.000|20110115013649.000|TR0|France, they smuggle guns.  And when they 
20110115013649.000|20110115013651.000|TR0|want they have.  But just crazy citizen, 
20110115013651.000|20110115013654.000|TR0|unstable, will not have a gun sold to them.
20110115013654.000|20110115013657.000|TR0|
20110115013657.000|20110115013659.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And just because folks here 
20110115013659.000|20110115013702.000|TR0|don't know.  Can you walk into a store and 
20110115013702.000|20110115013705.000|TR0|buy a gun in France?
20110115013705.000|20110115013707.000|TR0|
20110115013707.000|20110115013710.000|TR0|LEVY:  Of course not.
20110115013710.000|20110115013712.000|TR0|
20110115013712.000|20110115013715.000|TR0|SPITZER:  So who can?  I mean, look, who 
20110115013715.000|20110115013718.000|TR0|can?
20110115013718.000|20110115013720.000|TR0|
20110115013720.000|20110115013723.000|TR0|LEVY:  Nobody.
20110115013723.000|20110115013726.000|TR0|
20110115013726.000|20110115013728.000|TR0|You can if you have a special permit from 
20110115013728.000|20110115013731.000|TR0|the authorities.
20110115013731.000|20110115013733.000|TR0|
20110115013733.000|20110115013736.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110115013736.000|20110115013739.000|TR0|
20110115013739.000|20110115013741.000|TR0|LEVY:  If you have a good reason to be 
20110115013741.000|20110115013744.000|TR0|afraid for your life, your people --
20110115013744.000|20110115013747.000|TR0|
20110115013747.000|20110115013749.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And somehow society continues 
20110115013749.000|20110115013752.000|TR0|even without guns everywhere?
20110115013752.000|20110115013754.000|TR0|
20110115013754.000|20110115013757.000|TR0|LEVY:  You have no guns.  No weapons.  And 
20110115013757.000|20110115013800.000|TR0|even if you have the right to purchase a 
20110115013800.000|20110115013802.000|TR0|gun, which a few people have, you have not 
20110115013802.000|20110115013805.000|TR0|the right to have it in your pocket in the 
20110115013805.000|20110115013808.000|TR0|street.  You have a permit, an 
20110115013808.000|20110115013810.000|TR0|authorization of detention.
20110115013810.000|20110115013813.000|TR0|
20110115013813.000|20110115013816.000|TR0|SPITZER:  So as an observer of American 
20110115013816.000|20110115013818.000|TR0|society, you have traveled.  You are the 
20110115013818.000|20110115013821.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) of the modern era.  How do you 
20110115013821.000|20110115013823.000|TR0|understand this?  What does it speak to in 
20110115013823.000|20110115013826.000|TR0|our society or culture?
20110115013826.000|20110115013829.000|TR0|
20110115013829.000|20110115013831.000|TR0|LEVY:  It is in heritage of the past.  
20110115013831.000|20110115013834.000|TR0|Once upon the time, America at the time of 
20110115013834.000|20110115013837.000|TR0|the pioneers when everyone had to fight 
20110115013837.000|20110115013839.000|TR0|for his children and for his own house 
20110115013839.000|20110115013842.000|TR0|there was probably a legitimacy.  But now, 
20110115013842.000|20110115013844.000|TR0|please, we are completely a different 
20110115013844.000|20110115013847.000|TR0|country and exemplary democracy is such a 
20110115013847.000|20110115013850.000|TR0|civilized and sophisticated place, so 
20110115013850.000|20110115013852.000|TR0|there is no way except the lobby.
20110115013852.000|20110115013855.000|TR0|
20110115013855.000|20110115013858.000|TR0|You have a strong lobby, Charlton Heston, 
20110115013858.000|20110115013900.000|TR0|the National...
20110115013900.000|20110115013903.000|TR0|
20110115013903.000|20110115013905.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110115013905.000|20110115013908.000|TR0|
20110115013908.000|20110115013911.000|TR0|LEVY:  The National Rifle Association.  I 
20110115013911.000|20110115013913.000|TR0|want to see them once in the surroundings 
20110115013913.000|20110115013916.000|TR0|of Washington.  They're crazy people 
20110115013916.000|20110115013919.000|TR0|defending some vested interest, the lobby 
20110115013919.000|20110115013921.000|TR0|of guns.  You have to break the guns lobby 
20110115013921.000|20110115013924.000|TR0|in this country.  If not, you will have 
20110115013924.000|20110115013926.000|TR0|other Christina Green, and other Gabrielle 
20110115013926.000|20110115013929.000|TR0|Giffords.  You will have many others.  You 
20110115013929.000|20110115013932.000|TR0|have to break this lobby.  You have good 
20110115013932.000|20110115013934.000|TR0|lobbies in a democracy.
20110115013934.000|20110115013937.000|TR0|
20110115013937.000|20110115013940.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.  You have strong feelings 
20110115013940.000|20110115013942.000|TR0|on this?
20110115013942.000|20110115013945.000|TR0|
20110115013945.000|20110115013947.000|TR0|LEVY:  And you are, by the way -- I have 
20110115013947.000|20110115013950.000|TR0|strong feelings because I am completely 
20110115013950.000|20110115013953.000|TR0|destroyed by the idea of this little girl, 
20110115013953.000|20110115013955.000|TR0|again, born the very day of September 11, 
20110115013955.000|20110115013958.000|TR0|proving as Obama said, her citizenship, in 
20110115013958.000|20110115014001.000|TR0|a way, her love for democracy, by being 
20110115014001.000|20110115014003.000|TR0|there and being killed in such an unfair 
20110115014003.000|20110115014006.000|TR0|way.  Of course, I have strong feelings.  
20110115014006.000|20110115014009.000|TR0|As all the citizens who watch us today, we 
20110115014009.000|20110115014011.000|TR0|all have strong feelings in front of this 
20110115014011.000|20110115014014.000|TR0|absolute tragedy.
20110115014014.000|20110115014016.000|TR0|
20110115014016.000|20110115014019.000|TR0|PARKER:  As we all do.  There's no 
20110115014019.000|20110115014022.000|TR0|question about it.
20110115014022.000|20110115014024.000|TR0|
20110115014024.000|20110115014027.000|TR0|LEVY:  I know.
20110115014027.000|20110115014030.000|TR0|
20110115014030.000|20110115014032.000|TR0|PARKER:  It's horrifying.

20110115014035.000|20110115014037.000|TR0|PARKER:  I know, Kathleen, I know.
20110115014037.000|20110115014040.000|TR0|
20110115014040.000|20110115014043.000|TR0|PARKER:  But we know this particular 
20110115014043.000|20110115014045.000|TR0|gunman was not really -- he was obsessed 
20110115014045.000|20110115014048.000|TR0|with the congresswoman but he was not 
20110115014048.000|20110115014051.000|TR0|politically motivated.  He was not making 
20110115014051.000|20110115014053.000|TR0|a political statement.  He seems to have 
20110115014053.000|20110115014056.000|TR0|some serious mental health problems.  And 
20110115014056.000|20110115014058.000|TR0|yet, this conversation has taken on 
20110115014058.000|20110115014101.000|TR0|political elements.  And I'm sure you've 
20110115014101.000|20110115014104.000|TR0|heard that Sarah Palin was initially 
20110115014104.000|20110115014106.000|TR0|blamed because she had put some map up on, 
20110115014106.000|20110115014109.000|TR0|you know, of targets on the map saying 
20110115014109.000|20110115014112.000|TR0|these are the people we want to target to 
20110115014112.000|20110115014114.000|TR0|defeat in the next election.  What do you 
20110115014114.000|20110115014117.000|TR0|make of all that?
20110115014117.000|20110115014119.000|TR0|
20110115014119.000|20110115014122.000|TR0|LEVY:  I am not -- I am not especially 
20110115014122.000|20110115014125.000|TR0|friendly to Sarah Palin, you know it.  I 
20110115014125.000|20110115014127.000|TR0|said it on this very table last year.  
20110115014127.000|20110115014130.000|TR0|And, of course, Sarah Palin should watch 
20110115014130.000|20110115014133.000|TR0|her words.  You cannot have a military 
20110115014133.000|20110115014135.000|TR0|language when you speak politics.  You 
20110115014135.000|20110115014138.000|TR0|cannot draw a map or present a map of 
20110115014138.000|20110115014140.000|TR0|America with 20 targets, and you cannot -- 
20110115014140.000|20110115014143.000|TR0|when you are politically responsible you 
20110115014143.000|20110115014146.000|TR0|are the guardian of the word.  For 
20110115014146.000|20110115014148.000|TR0|example, when Sarah Palin says that she is 
20110115014148.000|20110115014151.000|TR0|a victim of a blood libel, this is 
20110115014151.000|20110115014154.000|TR0|incorrect.  She should not say that.  It 
20110115014154.000|20110115014156.000|TR0|is felt as an insult by a lot of people 
20110115014156.000|20110115014159.000|TR0|who are themselves the inheritors of a 
20110115014159.000|20110115014202.000|TR0|people who was victim of blood libel.
20110115014202.000|20110115014204.000|TR0|
20110115014204.000|20110115014207.000|TR0|You journalists, we intellectuals, they 
20110115014207.000|20110115014209.000|TR0|politically responsible have duties.  Our 
20110115014209.000|20110115014212.000|TR0|main duty, either use we make of the 
20110115014212.000|20110115014215.000|TR0|words.  We are guardians of the words.  
20110115014215.000|20110115014217.000|TR0|This is one of the lessons we tried to 
20110115014217.000|20110115014220.000|TR0|develop in our book.  Writers, responsible 
20110115014220.000|20110115014223.000|TR0|we are guardian of the words.
20110115014223.000|20110115014225.000|TR0|
20110115014225.000|20110115014228.000|TR0|SPITZER:  So to come full circle, will the 
20110115014228.000|20110115014230.000|TR0|civility that the president so eloquently 
20110115014230.000|20110115014233.000|TR0|called for survive?  Or will the use of 
20110115014233.000|20110115014236.000|TR0|guns and will Sarah Palin's type of 
20110115014236.000|20110115014238.000|TR0|language once again come to dominate our 
20110115014238.000|20110115014241.000|TR0|discourse, and why has it been there?
20110115014241.000|20110115014244.000|TR0|
20110115014244.000|20110115014246.000|TR0|LEVY:  It is really the stake of today.  
20110115014246.000|20110115014249.000|TR0|It is a stake of today. Maybe people like 
20110115014249.000|20110115014251.000|TR0|Sarah Palin will win.  Then it will be 
20110115014251.000|20110115014254.000|TR0|very bad for this country.  But maybe even 
20110115014254.000|20110115014257.000|TR0|Sarah Palin, which I suspect, is 
20110115014257.000|20110115014259.000|TR0|understanding because she is not -- she is 
20110115014259.000|20110115014302.000|TR0|not stupid.  She is not -- she is not a 
20110115014302.000|20110115014305.000|TR0|bad woman, probably.  I'm sure she is as 
20110115014305.000|20110115014307.000|TR0|horrified as us by the fate of Christina 
20110115014307.000|20110115014310.000|TR0|Green.  And she is asking questions to 
20110115014310.000|20110115014312.000|TR0|herself.  She knows that when she says 
20110115014312.000|20110115014315.000|TR0|that, you have to reach out.  I don't know 
20110115014315.000|20110115014318.000|TR0|the word in English to reach out.  The 
20110115014318.000|20110115014320.000|TR0|argument (ph) -- she knows.

20110115014344.000|20110115014347.000|TR0|
20110115014347.000|20110115014349.000|TR0|LEVY:  She knows that this is not the 
20110115014349.000|20110115014352.000|TR0|proper way to make politics in the 
20110115014352.000|20110115014355.000|TR0|countries of Abraham Lincoln, of George 
20110115014355.000|20110115014357.000|TR0|Washington and of Alexis de Tocqueville.

20110115014400.000|20110115014402.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Right.
20110115014402.000|20110115014405.000|TR0|
20110115014405.000|20110115014408.000|TR0|LEVY:  So my guess is that the Obama line 
20110115014408.000|20110115014410.000|TR0|will win.  If not, the country will be in 
20110115014410.000|20110115014413.000|TR0|very bad shape.  And you know, Sarah 
20110115014413.000|20110115014416.000|TR0|Palin, all these Tea Party movement and so 
20110115014416.000|20110115014418.000|TR0|on, the victims of it are not the 
20110115014418.000|20110115014421.000|TR0|Democrats.  It will be the Republicans 
20110115014421.000|20110115014423.000|TR0|themselves.
20110115014423.000|20110115014426.000|TR0|
20110115014426.000|20110115014429.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Yes.
20110115014429.000|20110115014431.000|TR0|
20110115014431.000|20110115014434.000|TR0|LEVY:  The decent Republicans who are such 
20110115014434.000|20110115014437.000|TR0|a tradition in this country which are half 
20110115014437.000|20110115014439.000|TR0|of the country and the -- and half of the 
20110115014439.000|20110115014442.000|TR0|honor of this country, they will be the 
20110115014442.000|20110115014444.000|TR0|victims of these indecent and uncivilized 
20110115014444.000|20110115014447.000|TR0|views of the world.  That's why I'm 
20110115014447.000|20110115014450.000|TR0|pleading for guarding the words, 
20110115014450.000|20110115014452.000|TR0|civilizing the speech, what President 
20110115014452.000|20110115014455.000|TR0|Obama said in such an eloquent way.  He 
20110115014455.000|20110115014458.000|TR0|re-found his great eloquence the day 
20110115014458.000|20110115014500.000|TR0|before yesterday.  He is right.

20110115014503.000|20110115014505.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, we hope you are correct

20110115014532.000|20110115014534.000|TR0|PARKER:  Ahead, he has been at her side 
20110115014534.000|20110115014537.000|TR0|ever since she came out of surgery.  
20110115014537.000|20110115014540.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords's husband is an officer 
20110115014540.000|20110115014542.000|TR0|and a gentleman.  A very real love story 
20110115014542.000|20110115014545.000|TR0|when we come back.

20110115014550.000|20110115014553.000|TR0|
20110115014553.000|20110115014555.000|TR0|PARKER:  What an incredible week, shock, 
20110115014555.000|20110115014558.000|TR0|horror, tears, inspiration.  A relatively 
20110115014558.000|20110115014601.000|TR0|unknown congresswoman from Arizona has 
20110115014601.000|20110115014603.000|TR0|become part of our national family and now 
20110115014603.000|20110115014606.000|TR0|we're beginning to learn more about her 
20110115014606.000|20110115014609.000|TR0|husband, Captain Mark Kelly.
20110115014609.000|20110115014611.000|TR0|
20110115014611.000|20110115014614.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Captain Kelly was in Houston 
20110115014614.000|20110115014616.000|TR0|when he learned of the shooting.  Houston 
20110115014616.000|20110115014619.000|TR0|is where he works as an astronaut, 
20110115014619.000|20110115014622.000|TR0|three-time veteran of shuttle missions.  
20110115014622.000|20110115014624.000|TR0|He and his twin brother Scott are the only 
20110115014624.000|20110115014627.000|TR0|siblings to have been in space.  Before 
20110115014627.000|20110115014630.000|TR0|that, Mark Kelly was a Navy fighter pilot. 
20110115014630.000|20110115014632.000|TR0| He flew 39 combat missions in the gulf 
20110115014632.000|20110115014635.000|TR0|war.
20110115014635.000|20110115014637.000|TR0|
20110115014637.000|20110115014640.000|TR0|PARKER:  Gabrielle and Mark give new 
20110115014640.000|20110115014643.000|TR0|meaning to the term "power couple." She's 
20110115014643.000|20110115014645.000|TR0|the only member of Congress whose spouse 
20110115014645.000|20110115014648.000|TR0|is on active service.  She met -- they met 
20110115014648.000|20110115014651.000|TR0|in China.  And it wasn't until she was 
20110115014651.000|20110115014653.000|TR0|running for Congress that Mark began to 
20110115014653.000|20110115014656.000|TR0|show up at her rallies, like the one in 
20110115014656.000|20110115014658.000|TR0|Tucson.  She came to one of his shuttle 
20110115014658.000|20110115014701.000|TR0|launches.  And after that it was liftoff.  
20110115014701.000|20110115014704.000|TR0|At their wedding, Mark's shuttle crew 
20110115014704.000|20110115014706.000|TR0|formed the traditional military arch of 
20110115014706.000|20110115014709.000|TR0|cross sabers.
20110115014709.000|20110115014712.000|TR0|
20110115014712.000|20110115014714.000|TR0|SPITZER:  No wonder one of Giffords' first 
20110115014714.000|20110115014717.000|TR0|movements was to reach for Mark and try to 
20110115014717.000|20110115014720.000|TR0|hug him.  Her doctors believe that having

20110115014735.000|20110115014738.000|TR0| Yes, miracles happen every day.  And in 
20110115014738.000|20110115014741.000|TR0|medicine we like to very much attribute 
20110115014741.000|20110115014743.000|TR0|them to either what we do or others do 
20110115014743.000|20110115014746.000|TR0|around us.  But a lot of medicine is 
20110115014746.000|20110115014748.000|TR0|outside of our control.  We're wise to 
20110115014748.000|20110115014751.000|TR0|acknowledge miracles.

20110115014812.000|20110115014815.000|TR0|different sort than we've been hearing 
20110115014815.000|20110115014817.000|TR0|about out of Tucson.  This hero is a 
20110115014817.000|20110115014820.000|TR0|decorated Iraq war veteran who's choosing 
20110115014820.000|20110115014823.000|TR0|to return to active duty in Afghanistan in

20110115014833.000|20110115014836.000|TR0|and violent than ever before, an 
20110115014836.000|20110115014838.000|TR0|Afghanistan that is expected to get worse 
20110115014838.000|20110115014841.000|TR0|before it gets better.  Listen to the

20110115014854.000|20110115014857.000|TR0|CHAIRMAN:  A relatively mild winter 
20110115014857.000|20110115014859.000|TR0|through which the enemy has continued 
20110115014859.000|20110115014902.000|TR0|fighting will give way to spring.  Poor 
20110115014902.000|20110115014905.000|TR0|governance will, where it persists, 
20110115014905.000|20110115014907.000|TR0|encourage Taliban intimidation.  And now 
20110115014907.000|20110115014910.000|TR0|with 100,000 more coalition and Afghan 
20110115014910.000|20110115014913.000|TR0|forces on the ground than last year, we 
20110115014913.000|20110115014915.000|TR0|will expand our presence into areas the 
20110115014915.000|20110115014918.000|TR0|enemy still wishes to control.  As 
20110115014918.000|20110115014920.000|TR0|difficult as it may be to accept, we must 
20110115014920.000|20110115014923.000|TR0|prepare ourselves for more violence and 
20110115014923.000|20110115014926.000|TR0|more casualties in coming months.  The 
20110115014926.000|20110115014928.000|TR0|violence will be worse in 2011 than it was 
20110115014928.000|20110115014931.000|TR0|in 2010 in many parts of Afghanistan.

20110115015005.000|20110115015008.000|TR0|SPITZER:  First question for you, what is 
20110115015008.000|20110115015010.000|TR0|your assessment of how the war in 
20110115015010.000|20110115015013.000|TR0|Afghanistan is going?  And what does 
20110115015013.000|20110115015016.000|TR0|victory look like? How do you define what 
20110115015016.000|20110115015018.000|TR0|victory will be if it's attainable in 
20110115015018.000|20110115015021.000|TR0|Afghanistan?
20110115015021.000|20110115015023.000|TR0|
20110115015023.000|20110115015026.000|TR0|HEGSETH:  Well, I agree with what the 
20110115015026.000|20110115015029.000|TR0|chairman just said.  As we push out into 
20110115015029.000|20110115015031.000|TR0|remote villages in the Taliban-held areas, 
20110115015031.000|20110115015034.000|TR0|violence is going to go up and the 
20110115015034.000|20110115015037.000|TR0|casualties, unfortunately, for the U.S. 
20110115015037.000|20110115015039.000|TR0|are going to go up.  But progress will be 
20110115015039.000|20110115015042.000|TR0|measured in sympathies and local 
20110115015042.000|20110115015044.000|TR0|sympathies and training of Afghan security 
20110115015044.000|20110115015047.000|TR0|forces.  And that's what we'll need to 
20110115015047.000|20110115015050.000|TR0|look at.
20110115015050.000|20110115015052.000|TR0|
20110115015052.000|20110115015055.000|TR0|As far as going forward, I agree with the 
20110115015055.000|20110115015058.000|TR0|president and his tragedy.  It's defeat Al 
20110115015058.000|20110115015100.000|TR0|Qaeda, reverse the momentum of the 
20110115015100.000|20110115015103.000|TR0|Taliban, and train Afghan security forces 
20110115015103.000|20110115015106.000|TR0|and try to create an Afghan, viable Afghan 
20110115015106.000|20110115015108.000|TR0|government that can take over so we can 
20110115015108.000|20110115015111.000|TR0|bring our guys home. It's the same 
20110115015111.000|20110115015113.000|TR0|playbook we brought with the surge in 
20110115015113.000|20110115015116.000|TR0|Iraq.  Much very -- you know, very 
20110115015116.000|20110115015119.000|TR0|different as far as the details.  But, 
20110115015119.000|20110115015121.000|TR0|protect the population, bring the violence 
20110115015121.000|20110115015124.000|TR0|down, you have to secure the area first.  
20110115015124.000|20110115015127.000|TR0|And when you do that, then you can expect 
20110115015127.000|20110115015129.000|TR0|local Afghans to step up and security 
20110115015129.000|20110115015132.000|TR0|forces to take over which is how we 
20110115015132.000|20110115015134.000|TR0|eventually pull ourselves out.
20110115015134.000|20110115015137.000|TR0|
20110115015137.000|20110115015140.000|TR0|PARKER:  Pete, Kathleen Parker here.  I 
20110115015140.000|20110115015142.000|TR0|want to ask you just a personal question.  
20110115015142.000|20110115015145.000|TR0|But first, I want to personally thank you 
20110115015145.000|20110115015148.000|TR0|for your service.  You have a 7-month-old 
20110115015148.000|20110115015150.000|TR0|child.  And you are reenlisting, going 
20110115015150.000|20110115015153.000|TR0|back into the war.  Why are you doing that?
20110115015153.000|20110115015155.000|TR0|
20110115015155.000|20110115015158.000|TR0|HEGSETH:  Well, I'm doing it because it's 
20110115015158.000|20110115015201.000|TR0|what I believe in. It's what millions of 
20110115015201.000|20110115015203.000|TR0|Americans believe in.  We've seen this 
20110115015203.000|20110115015206.000|TR0|enemy firsthand.  We understand what's at 
20110115015206.000|20110115015209.000|TR0|stake.
20110115015209.000|20110115015211.000|TR0|
20110115015211.000|20110115015214.000|TR0|This is a war that's gone on almost a 
20110115015214.000|20110115015216.000|TR0|decade since 9/22, but it doesn't mean it 
20110115015216.000|20110115015219.000|TR0|goes away.  A lot of people don't see it 
20110115015219.000|20110115015222.000|TR0|on a daily basis and don't interact with 
20110115015222.000|20110115015224.000|TR0|the realities.  But we're at war.  And 
20110115015224.000|20110115015227.000|TR0|we're in a very vicious war with a vicious 
20110115015227.000|20110115015230.000|TR0|enemy who seeks to defeat us.  And as 
20110115015230.000|20110115015232.000|TR0|someone who's gone through the training 
20110115015232.000|20110115015235.000|TR0|and is qualified, I want to make sure I'm 
20110115015235.000|20110115015238.000|TR0|doing everything I can to contribute.  So 
20110115015238.000|20110115015240.000|TR0|it's hard to leave family, it's hard to 
20110115015240.000|20110115015243.000|TR0|leave loved ones, but there are so many 
20110115015243.000|20110115015245.000|TR0|more who have done more tours than I have, 
20110115015245.000|20110115015248.000|TR0|who have spent more time overseas, more 
20110115015248.000|20110115015251.000|TR0|time in harm's way.  And they do it for 
20110115015251.000|20110115015253.000|TR0|all of us. They do this because, you know, 
20110115015253.000|20110115015256.000|TR0|if we can get this thing right, if we can 
20110115015256.000|20110115015259.000|TR0|get Afghanistan to a place like where Iraq 
20110115015259.000|20110115015301.000|TR0|is right now, where we've got stable 
20110115015301.000|20110115015304.000|TR0|governments and security forces that can 
20110115015304.000|20110115015306.000|TR0|do it themselves, that lowers the threat 
20110115015306.000|20110115015309.000|TR0|to us and our people here in the United 
20110115015309.000|20110115015312.000|TR0|States and around the world.
20110115015312.000|20110115015314.000|TR0|
20110115015314.000|20110115015317.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, but Pete, when I heard 
20110115015317.000|20110115015320.000|TR0|you describe what victory meant, and what 
20110115015320.000|20110115015322.000|TR0|the objective was, you put it, I think 
20110115015322.000|20110115015325.000|TR0|quite properly, I think we would almost 
20110115015325.000|20110115015327.000|TR0|all agree with this in the context of Al 
20110115015327.000|20110115015330.000|TR0|Qaeda.  The question we have and the 
20110115015330.000|20110115015333.000|TR0|question that I think that we keep bumping 
20110115015333.000|20110115015335.000|TR0|into is, isn't Al Qaeda now in Pakistan or 
20110115015335.000|20110115015338.000|TR0|Somalia or Yemen, not so much in 
20110115015338.000|20110115015341.000|TR0|Afghanistan?  And so, aren't we fighting 
20110115015341.000|20110115015343.000|TR0|an illusory enemy that has moved elsewhere 
20110115015343.000|20110115015346.000|TR0|and by putting at risk our brave soldiers, 
20110115015346.000|20110115015348.000|TR0|such as you whom we all honor, aren't we 
20110115015348.000|20110115015351.000|TR0|in essence fighting in the wrong place?  
20110115015351.000|20110115015354.000|TR0|And wouldn't a strategy that Joe Biden 
20110115015354.000|20110115015356.000|TR0|supported more counterterrorism drones 
20110115015356.000|20110115015359.000|TR0|perhaps be more successful at pursuing Al 
20110115015359.000|20110115015402.000|TR0|Qaeda?
20110115015402.000|20110115015404.000|TR0|
20110115015404.000|20110115015407.000|TR0|HEGSETH:  Well, Al Qaeda, when we focus on 
20110115015407.000|20110115015409.000|TR0|the war front, Al Qaeda is oftentimes 
20110115015409.000|20110115015412.000|TR0|going to follow that path of least 
20110115015412.000|20110115015415.000|TR0|resistance.  So just because we focused on 
20110115015415.000|20110115015417.000|TR0|Afghanistan and they move into Pakistan, 
20110115015417.000|20110115015420.000|TR0|the Obama administration has done the 
20110115015420.000|20110115015423.000|TR0|right thing by increasing drone attacks 
20110115015423.000|20110115015425.000|TR0|and drone strikes.  We need to keep the 
20110115015425.000|20110115015428.000|TR0|pressure on there. But what leads us to 
20110115015428.000|20110115015431.000|TR0|believe that if we abandon Afghanistan 
20110115015431.000|20110115015433.000|TR0|that Al Qaeda wouldn't go back and use it 
20110115015433.000|20110115015436.000|TR0|again?  So, I don't think just saying 
20110115015436.000|20110115015438.000|TR0|they're not there anymore means we 
20110115015438.000|20110115015441.000|TR0|shouldn't finish the job properly in 
20110115015441.000|20110115015444.000|TR0|Afghanistan and put something in its place 
20110115015444.000|20110115015446.000|TR0|that doesn't allow us to go back to a 
20110115015446.000|20110115015449.000|TR0|pre-9/11 reality where the Taliban and Al 
20110115015449.000|20110115015452.000|TR0|Qaeda are able to collaborate or any 
20110115015452.000|20110115015454.000|TR0|entity are able to collaborate. It's an 
20110115015454.000|20110115015457.000|TR0|unstable place.  So abandoning Afghanistan 
20110115015457.000|20110115015459.000|TR0|doesn't help the equation in taking on Al 
20110115015459.000|20110115015502.000|TR0|Qaeda.  You've got to do it in 
20110115015502.000|20110115015505.000|TR0|Afghanistan. You've got to do in Pakistan, 
20110115015505.000|20110115015507.000|TR0|like the Obama administration is doing it 
20110115015507.000|20110115015510.000|TR0|in Yemen and elsewhere.  But getting rid 
20110115015510.000|20110115015513.000|TR0|of not committing sufficiently to 
20110115015513.000|20110115015515.000|TR0|completing the job in Afghanistan, I just 
20110115015515.000|20110115015518.000|TR0|don't think it helps us get where we want 
20110115015518.000|20110115015520.000|TR0|to be.
20110115015520.000|20110115015523.000|TR0|
20110115015523.000|20110115015526.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, Pete, what is your 
20110115015526.000|20110115015528.000|TR0|assessment of the Karzai government?  You 
20110115015528.000|20110115015531.000|TR0|know, we've heard lots of stories about 
20110115015531.000|20110115015534.000|TR0|how corrupt the government is taking money 
20110115015534.000|20110115015536.000|TR0|from Iran, et cetera, et cetera. What's 
20110115015536.000|20110115015539.000|TR0|your appraisal?
20110115015539.000|20110115015541.000|TR0|
20110115015541.000|20110115015544.000|TR0|HEGSETH:  Well, I haven't had any 
20110115015544.000|20110115015547.000|TR0|firsthand interaction with the Karzai 
20110115015547.000|20110115015549.000|TR0|government.  So I'm getting exactly what 
20110115015549.000|20110115015552.000|TR0|you're hearing. Obviously, corrupt 
20110115015552.000|20110115015555.000|TR0|services aren't reaching the people where 
20110115015555.000|20110115015557.000|TR0|they need to be.  That is a very, very big 
20110115015557.000|20110115015600.000|TR0|problem.  But I would rewind back. It's 
20110115015600.000|20110115015602.000|TR0|not a perfect analogy but I think it fits 
20110115015602.000|20110115015605.000|TR0|to the Maliki government in Iraq.
20110115015605.000|20110115015608.000|TR0|
20110115015608.000|20110115015610.000|TR0|A lot of people said they were corrupt, 
20110115015610.000|20110115015613.000|TR0|incapable of governing, unwilling to take 
20110115015613.000|20110115015616.000|TR0|on the Shia militias, and a lot of that 
20110115015616.000|20110115015618.000|TR0|was true in 2007.  But once you saw the 
20110115015618.000|20110115015621.000|TR0|security environment change, that 
20110115015621.000|20110115015624.000|TR0|government moved and changed with it.  And 
20110115015624.000|20110115015626.000|TR0|I think the same could happen in 
20110115015626.000|20110115015629.000|TR0|Afghanistan.  If we're able to really beat 
20110115015629.000|20110115015631.000|TR0|back the Taliban and deny Al Qaeda haven, 
20110115015631.000|20110115015634.000|TR0|you're going to see some of these 
20110115015634.000|20110115015637.000|TR0|governors in these provinces switch their 
20110115015637.000|20110115015639.000|TR0|allegiances and their calculations back 
20110115015639.000|20110115015642.000|TR0|towards the Karzai government.  I think 
20110115015642.000|20110115015645.000|TR0|you would force the Karzai government to 
20110115015645.000|20110115015647.000|TR0|really try to represent more and all the 
20110115015647.000|20110115015650.000|TR0|people. It's not going to fix the problem. 
20110115015650.000|20110115015652.000|TR0| But you can't expect the political -- you 
20110115015652.000|20110115015655.000|TR0|can't always expect the political 
20110115015655.000|20110115015658.000|TR0|environment to move the security 
20110115015658.000|20110115015700.000|TR0|environment.  The security environment is 
20110115015700.000|20110115015703.000|TR0|the necessary precondition for political 
20110115015703.000|20110115015706.000|TR0|progress.  That's why it's so important 
20110115015706.000|20110115015708.000|TR0|what we're doing on the ground with these 
20110115015708.000|20110115015711.000|TR0|soldiers and Marines down in the south and 
20110115015711.000|20110115015713.000|TR0|the east in Afghanistan.  You beat back 
20110115015713.000|20110115015716.000|TR0|that enemy, it creates the space for 
20110115015716.000|20110115015719.000|TR0|Karzai and others to actually provide the 
20110115015719.000|20110115015721.000|TR0|kind of government we're all looking for.
20110115015721.000|20110115015724.000|TR0|
20110115015724.000|20110115015727.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, Pete, change gears on 
20110115015727.000|20110115015729.000|TR0|you just a little bit. You had an article 
20110115015729.000|20110115015732.000|TR0|in "The Wall Street Journal" yesterday, 
20110115015732.000|20110115015734.000|TR0|suggesting that General Petraeus get a 
20110115015734.000|20110115015737.000|TR0|fifth star.  Right now, he's a four star 
20110115015737.000|20110115015740.000|TR0|general.  Go move him up to five.  Why is 
20110115015740.000|20110115015742.000|TR0|that?  And what historical context would 
20110115015742.000|20110115015745.000|TR0|that put him in?
20110115015745.000|20110115015748.000|TR0|
20110115015748.000|20110115015750.000|TR0|HEGSETH:  Well, historical context, 
20110115015750.000|20110115015753.000|TR0|General Washington led the Continental 
20110115015753.000|20110115015755.000|TR0|Army for eight years.  And many of the 
20110115015755.000|20110115015758.000|TR0|other folks that have worn the fifth star 
20110115015758.000|20110115015801.000|TR0|served much shorter than that.  General 
20110115015801.000|20110115015803.000|TR0|Petraeus is going on his eighth year of a 
20110115015803.000|20110115015806.000|TR0|combatant command.  He's the guy who's the 
20110115015806.000|20110115015809.000|TR0|architect of the turnaround in Iraq.  He's 
20110115015809.000|20110115015811.000|TR0|now leading the fight in Afghanistan 
20110115015811.000|20110115015814.000|TR0|having stepped down as the CENTCOM 
20110115015814.000|20110115015817.000|TR0|commander and has really demonstrated we 
20110115015817.000|20110115015819.000|TR0|believe embodies the success and the 
20110115015819.000|20110115015822.000|TR0|initiative and the resolve of our 
20110115015822.000|20110115015824.000|TR0|generation of warriors.  And he's very, 
20110115015824.000|20110115015827.000|TR0|just as deserving as any of those previous 
20110115015827.000|20110115015830.000|TR0|generals of that fifth star.
20110115015830.000|20110115015832.000|TR0|
20110115015832.000|20110115015835.000|TR0|Logistically, it's a difficult thing.  I 
20110115015835.000|20110115015838.000|TR0|think a lot of people raise their eyebrows 
20110115015838.000|20110115015840.000|TR0|and say, well, wait, wouldn't he outrank 
20110115015840.000|20110115015843.000|TR0|the CENTCOM commander?  Wouldn't he -- I 
20110115015843.000|20110115015845.000|TR0|think it could be a temporary wartime rank 
20110115015845.000|20110115015848.000|TR0|to both recognize what he has accomplished 
20110115015848.000|20110115015851.000|TR0|and recognize what the men and women 
20110115015851.000|20110115015853.000|TR0|underneath him have accomplished, and 
20110115015853.000|20110115015856.000|TR0|really demonstrate a commitment to the 
20110115015856.000|20110115015859.000|TR0|fight in Afghanistan which I think would 
20110115015859.000|20110115015901.000|TR0|do a whole lot of good for our fighting 
20110115015901.000|20110115015904.000|TR0|men and women, our allies and the folks in 
20110115015904.000|20110115015906.000|TR0|Afghanistan.
