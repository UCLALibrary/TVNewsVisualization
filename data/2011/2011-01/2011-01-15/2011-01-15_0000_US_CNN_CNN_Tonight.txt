20110115000007.000|20110115000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST:  Thanks Wolf and good 
20110115000009.000|20110115000011.000|TR0|evening everyone.  Another emotional day 
20110115000011.000|20110115000014.000|TR0|in Tucson, police released a time line 
20110115000014.000|20110115000016.000|TR0|detailing suspect Jared Lee Loughner's 
20110115000016.000|20110115000019.000|TR0|actions leading up to the shooting.  
20110115000019.000|20110115000021.000|TR0|Twenty-three minutes after he got 
20110115000021.000|20110115000023.000|TR0|frustrated waiting to buy ammunition in 
20110115000023.000|20110115000026.000|TR0|one Walmart, he went to a second a few 
20110115000026.000|20110115000028.000|TR0|miles away and bought bullets and a black 
20110115000028.000|20110115000031.000|TR0|bag to carry them in.  We'll map out the 
20110115000031.000|20110115000033.000|TR0|final hours of this assassination plot and 
20110115000033.000|20110115000035.000|TR0|we'll hear from a shooting victim who got 
20110115000035.000|20110115000038.000|TR0|home from the hospital only last night.  
20110115000038.000|20110115000040.000|TR0|Well today she went to Congresswoman 
20110115000040.000|20110115000043.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords' office to cheer up her

20110115000107.000|20110115000109.000|TR0|KING:  Moment there -- also tonight, some 
20110115000109.000|20110115000111.000|TR0|important political news.  The Obama 
20110115000111.000|20110115000114.000|TR0|administration pulls the plug on the 
20110115000114.000|20110115000116.000|TR0|so-called virtual fence along the 
20110115000116.000|20110115000119.000|TR0|U.S.-Mexican border deciding after $1 
20110115000119.000|20110115000121.000|TR0|billion of your money has been spent that 
20110115000121.000|20110115000123.000|TR0|it isn't worth it.
20110115000123.000|20110115000126.000|TR0|
20110115000126.000|20110115000128.000|TR0|The Republican National Committee tonight 
20110115000128.000|20110115000131.000|TR0|has a new leader.  The controversial 
20110115000131.000|20110115000133.000|TR0|Chairman Michael Steele got the boot 
20110115000133.000|20110115000135.000|TR0|despite all the big GOP wins last year.  
20110115000135.000|20110115000138.000|TR0|And let's just say Maine's governor is not 
20110115000138.000|20110115000140.000|TR0|leading the charge for a more civil tone 
20110115000140.000|20110115000143.000|TR0|in our politics.  Republican Paul LePage 
20110115000143.000|20110115000145.000|TR0|was asked what he would tell the NAACP who 
20110115000145.000|20110115000147.000|TR0|criticized his decision to skip an event 
20110115000147.000|20110115000150.000|TR0|marking the Martin Luther King holiday.

20110115000209.000|20110115000211.000|TR0|KING:  A busy hour ahead including that 
20110115000211.000|20110115000214.000|TR0|story, up first though an important day in 
20110115000214.000|20110115000216.000|TR0|Tucson with major movement in the 
20110115000216.000|20110115000219.000|TR0|investigation and in the healing process.  
20110115000219.000|20110115000221.000|TR0|Let's begin with the investigation and the 
20110115000221.000|20110115000223.000|TR0|new time line police released just earlier 
20110115000223.000|20110115000226.000|TR0|today.  Look at this map of Tucson, 
20110115000226.000|20110115000228.000|TR0|Arizona.  This is about a 7.5 mile radius. 
20110115000228.000|20110115000231.000|TR0| You see the Safeway over here, a Walmart 
20110115000231.000|20110115000233.000|TR0|over there, we'll walk through the detail 
20110115000233.000|20110115000235.000|TR0|in a minute, about a 7.5 mile circle, 
20110115000235.000|20110115000238.000|TR0|though, as you look at the whole thing.    
20110115000238.000|20110115000240.000|TR0|   The day began -- police tell us that 
20110115000240.000|20110115000243.000|TR0|Jared Lee Loughner began his day by 
20110115000243.000|20110115000245.000|TR0|spending the night at a Motel 6 right 
20110115000245.000|20110115000247.000|TR0|here, 12:29 a.m. he checked into this 
20110115000247.000|20110115000250.000|TR0|Motel 6.  Around 4:12 a.m. he put a 
20110115000250.000|20110115000252.000|TR0|posting on My Space, good-bye friends, he 
20110115000252.000|20110115000255.000|TR0|said in that posting then.  From there and 
20110115000255.000|20110115000257.000|TR0|we'll come back to the wide shot of the 
20110115000257.000|20110115000259.000|TR0|city so you can see what we're talking 
20110115000259.000|20110115000302.000|TR0|about.
20110115000302.000|20110115000304.000|TR0|
20110115000304.000|20110115000307.000|TR0|Remember the Motel 6 -- from there it was 
20110115000307.000|20110115000309.000|TR0|off to this Walmart, 7:04 a.m., Jared 
20110115000309.000|20110115000311.000|TR0|Loughner went into that store and we are 
20110115000311.000|20110115000314.000|TR0|told that he got frustrated, the clerk was 
20110115000314.000|20110115000316.000|TR0|acting so slowly, he was trying to buy 
20110115000316.000|20110115000319.000|TR0|ammunition.  But he left that Walmart.  
20110115000319.000|20110115000321.000|TR0|Now let's go back out to look here.  
20110115000321.000|20110115000323.000|TR0|Twenty-three minutes later, he was across 
20110115000323.000|20110115000326.000|TR0|the city at number four, that Walmart 
20110115000326.000|20110115000328.000|TR0|there, that is where he did purchase the 
20110115000328.000|20110115000331.000|TR0|ammunition police say was used in the 
20110115000331.000|20110115000333.000|TR0|slaying.
20110115000333.000|20110115000335.000|TR0|
20110115000335.000|20110115000338.000|TR0|From there he went home.  This is the 
20110115000338.000|20110115000340.000|TR0|family home right here.  He got home 
20110115000340.000|20110115000343.000|TR0|around 7:30 in the morning and I was told 
20110115000343.000|20110115000345.000|TR0|by a lead investigator when I was in 
20110115000345.000|20110115000347.000|TR0|Tucson earlier this week it was at this 
20110115000347.000|20110115000350.000|TR0|moment his father saw the black bag, Jared 
20110115000350.000|20110115000352.000|TR0|was acting strangely and his father had a 
20110115000352.000|20110115000355.000|TR0|question.
20110115000355.000|20110115000357.000|TR0|

20110115000404.000|20110115000407.000|TR0|SHERIFF'S DEPT.:  The father asked him 
20110115000407.000|20110115000409.000|TR0|questions to the -- similar to what are 
20110115000409.000|20110115000411.000|TR0|you doing, what is that.  And Jared 
20110115000411.000|20110115000414.000|TR0|mumbled something back to his dad, his dad 
20110115000414.000|20110115000416.000|TR0|said he didn't understand what was said, 
20110115000416.000|20110115000419.000|TR0|it was unintelligible.  And then Jared 
20110115000419.000|20110115000421.000|TR0|left.  The father followed.  The father 
20110115000421.000|20110115000423.000|TR0|got in his vehicle and tried to locate his 
20110115000423.000|20110115000426.000|TR0|son and follow the direction that he went 
20110115000426.000|20110115000428.000|TR0|and he could not locate his son.

20110115000435.000|20110115000438.000|TR0|KING:  You heard the lead investigator 
20110115000438.000|20110115000440.000|TR0|there, could not locate his son.  Jared 
20110115000440.000|20110115000443.000|TR0|went off on foot.  That is where police 
20110115000443.000|20110115000445.000|TR0|say he dumped the black bag in an area 
20110115000445.000|20110115000448.000|TR0|nearby.  Remember number five, the 
20110115000448.000|20110115000450.000|TR0|Loughner family home, police do know this. 
20110115000450.000|20110115000452.000|TR0| He then ended up at this Circle K and it 
20110115000452.000|20110115000455.000|TR0|was at this Circle K where he called a cab 
20110115000455.000|20110115000457.000|TR0|and was picked up. He was called and 
20110115000457.000|20110115000500.000|TR0|scheduled cab service, was picked up at 
20110115000500.000|20110115000502.000|TR0|the Circle K and from there, his fateful 
20110115000502.000|20110115000504.000|TR0|trip across the town to the Safeway here.
20110115000504.000|20110115000507.000|TR0|
20110115000507.000|20110115000509.000|TR0|He arrived a little before 10:00.  He had 
20110115000509.000|20110115000512.000|TR0|to go inside with the cab driver to make 
20110115000512.000|20110115000514.000|TR0|change, then he went to the event, got in 
20110115000514.000|20110115000516.000|TR0|line at the event, shortly after 10:00 
20110115000516.000|20110115000519.000|TR0|a.m. police say Jared Lee Loughner opened 
20110115000519.000|20110115000521.000|TR0|fire.  Again while in Tucson, I spoke to 
20110115000521.000|20110115000524.000|TR0|an aide to the congresswoman, Gabrielle 
20110115000524.000|20110115000526.000|TR0|Giffords, who said she was standing three 
20110115000526.000|20110115000528.000|TR0|or four feet from the congresswoman using 
20110115000528.000|20110115000531.000|TR0|her cameras to snap a picture when it all 
20110115000531.000|20110115000533.000|TR0|broke out.

20110115000543.000|20110115000545.000|TR0| I noticed out of the corner of my eye 
20110115000545.000|20110115000548.000|TR0|that something was moving and I just 
20110115000548.000|20110115000550.000|TR0|remember seeing his arm go up.  I remember 
20110115000550.000|20110115000552.000|TR0|seeing a very small gun in his hand and I 
20110115000552.000|20110115000555.000|TR0|heard the first shot.  Like I was watching 
20110115000555.000|20110115000557.000|TR0|the gun as it was shot. And then I just

20110115000607.000|20110115000609.000|TR0|for the congresswoman and her medical team 
20110115000609.000|20110115000612.000|TR0|says they're stepping up her physical 
20110115000612.000|20110115000614.000|TR0|therapy.  She's responding to more complex 
20110115000614.000|20110115000616.000|TR0|questions.

20110115000626.000|20110115000628.000|TR0| Obviously we're very cautious that she 
20110115000628.000|20110115000631.000|TR0|makes it at her own pace, but, again, we 
20110115000631.000|20110115000633.000|TR0|couldn't have hoped for any better 
20110115000633.000|20110115000636.000|TR0|improvement than we're seeing now given

20110115000652.000|20110115000655.000|TR0|only for a few minutes.  Simon is a 
20110115000655.000|20110115000657.000|TR0|Giffords' aide who was shot twice and she 
20110115000657.000|20110115000700.000|TR0|gave a harrowing account of her ordeal in

20110115000712.000|20110115000714.000|TR0|happened -- everything happened probably 
20110115000714.000|20110115000716.000|TR0|in a matter of seconds.  My feeling is 
20110115000716.000|20110115000719.000|TR0|that he was whirling, his back was to me.  
20110115000719.000|20110115000721.000|TR0|I saw the congresswoman go down.  I saw 
20110115000721.000|20110115000724.000|TR0|Ron go down.  And then I think I must have 
20110115000724.000|20110115000726.000|TR0|been one of the next people hit because 
20110115000726.000|20110115000728.000|TR0|from that point on, I was laying on the

20110115000740.000|20110115000743.000|TR0|Randi, a fascinating account.  We'll get 
20110115000743.000|20110115000745.000|TR0|to more of it in a moment.  Just when she 
20110115000745.000|20110115000748.000|TR0|showed up, when Pam Simon showed up, did 
20110115000748.000|20110115000750.000|TR0|she, before she was shot, did she see the 
20110115000750.000|20110115000752.000|TR0|shooter, see any signs of trouble at that 
20110115000752.000|20110115000755.000|TR0|Safeway?

20110115000757.000|20110115000800.000|TR0|RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  No.  We 
20110115000800.000|20110115000802.000|TR0|know according to police that Jared 
20110115000802.000|20110115000804.000|TR0|Loughner showed up there and asked to 
20110115000804.000|20110115000807.000|TR0|speak with the congresswoman so he was 
20110115000807.000|20110115000809.000|TR0|told by one of the staffers to get in 
20110115000809.000|20110115000812.000|TR0|line. And Pam Simon says that she didn't 
20110115000812.000|20110115000814.000|TR0|see him in that line, she never saw him 
20110115000814.000|20110115000816.000|TR0|get out of line, but she actually tried to 
20110115000816.000|20110115000819.000|TR0|talk to this couple, John that was talking 
20110115000819.000|20110115000821.000|TR0|with the congresswoman, she actually was 
20110115000821.000|20110115000824.000|TR0|about to lean in she said to try and get 
20110115000824.000|20110115000826.000|TR0|that couple's attention and speak with 
20110115000826.000|20110115000828.000|TR0|that group when she saw the shooter 
20110115000828.000|20110115000831.000|TR0|although she never saw his face, all of a 
20110115000831.000|20110115000833.000|TR0|sudden came in between them and started 
20110115000833.000|20110115000836.000|TR0|firing.

20110115000900.000|20110115000902.000|TR0|SIMON:  I don't remember the emotion of

20110115000904.000|20110115000907.000|TR0|survival instincts kicking in.  I laid 
20110115000907.000|20110115000909.000|TR0|very still and played dead.  I didn't know 
20110115000909.000|20110115000912.000|TR0|if he was still around.  And I checked to 
20110115000912.000|20110115000914.000|TR0|make sure my fingers and toes were working 
20110115000914.000|20110115000916.000|TR0|so I knew that I wasn't paralyzed.  And I 
20110115000916.000|20110115000919.000|TR0|didn't know how badly I had been shot or

20110115000933.000|20110115000936.000|TR0|Does she remember getting to the hospital

20110115000943.000|20110115000945.000|TR0|just tell you, she was shot twice, as you 
20110115000945.000|20110115000948.000|TR0|mentioned.  She was shot once in the wrist 
20110115000948.000|20110115000950.000|TR0|and the bullet actually went through her 
20110115000950.000|20110115000953.000|TR0|wrist and she was also shot, John, in the 
20110115000953.000|20110115000955.000|TR0|chest.  And that bullet made its way from 
20110115000955.000|20110115000957.000|TR0|her chest all the way down to her thigh.  
20110115000957.000|20110115001000.000|TR0|And that's why there bullet remains.

20110115001002.000|20110115001005.000|TR0|Doctors chose not to take that bullet out. 
20110115001005.000|20110115001007.000|TR0| She said to herself while she was lying 
20110115001007.000|20110115001009.000|TR0|on that ground that this is not my day to 
20110115001009.000|20110115001012.000|TR0|die and sure enough it wasn't.  She said 
20110115001012.000|20110115001014.000|TR0|that a good Samaritan came out of the 
20110115001014.000|20110115001017.000|TR0|Safeway super market right there, had 
20110115001017.000|20110115001019.000|TR0|heard the gunfire -- his name is Bob 
20110115001019.000|20110115001021.000|TR0|Digano (ph) -- what a hero that day, came 
20110115001021.000|20110115001024.000|TR0|over, talked with her, held her hand, told 
20110115001024.000|20110115001026.000|TR0|her she was going to be OK.  Rubbed her 
20110115001026.000|20110115001029.000|TR0|back, put his arm around her and even 
20110115001029.000|20110115001031.000|TR0|followed her ambulance here to this

20110115001200.000|20110115001202.000|TR0|Wisconsin is in as the new chairman of the 
20110115001202.000|20110115001205.000|TR0|Republican National Committee.  Steele was

20110115001207.000|20110115001209.000|TR0|huge Republican gains this year.  In the 
20110115001209.000|20110115001212.000|TR0|view of most party regulars, Republicans 
20110115001212.000|20110115001214.000|TR0|won despite Steele, not because of him,

20110115001233.000|20110115001236.000|TR0|We've worked hard and built a party, but 
20110115001236.000|20110115001238.000|TR0|it's very clear the party wants to do 
20110115001238.000|20110115001241.000|TR0|something a little different and hopefully 
20110115001241.000|20110115001243.000|TR0|a little bit better.  And I appreciate all 
20110115001243.000|20110115001245.000|TR0|the hard work that all of you have brought 
20110115001245.000|20110115001248.000|TR0|to the table.

20110115001331.000|20110115001333.000|TR0|correspondent Jessica Yellin watched the 
20110115001333.000|20110115001336.000|TR0|seven rounds of balloting and under 
20110115001336.000|20110115001338.000|TR0|Priebus, Jess, I assume they have -- they 
20110115001338.000|20110115001341.000|TR0|want a lower profile, they want less 
20110115001341.000|20110115001343.000|TR0|controversy, they want to get about the 
20110115001343.000|20110115001345.000|TR0|nuts and bolts of organizing.

20110115001350.000|20110115001353.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  That's exactly the phrase 
20110115001353.000|20110115001355.000|TR0|I was going to use, nuts and bolts.  He 
20110115001355.000|20110115001358.000|TR0|emphasized even when he took his -- gave 
20110115001358.000|20110115001400.000|TR0|his first press remarks that he will focus 
20110115001400.000|20110115001402.000|TR0|on getting on the phone with donors 
20110115001402.000|20110115001405.000|TR0|tonight and starting to raise money and 
20110115001405.000|20110115001407.000|TR0|get organized for 2012.  As you pointed 
20110115001407.000|20110115001410.000|TR0|out, John, he's the behind the scenes guy. 
20110115001410.000|20110115001412.000|TR0| He's the guy who rolls up his shirt 
20110115001412.000|20110115001414.000|TR0|sleeves and does the hard sometimes boring 
20110115001414.000|20110115001417.000|TR0|work which is exactly what most of the 
20110115001417.000|20110115001419.000|TR0|folks in this room really wanted from him 
20110115001419.000|20110115001422.000|TR0|as they try to unify, the word he used, 
20110115001422.000|20110115001424.000|TR0|for 2012 and as the RNC in truth fights 
20110115001424.000|20110115001426.000|TR0|for its own relevance -- John.

20110115001429.000|20110115001431.000|TR0|KING:  And they're still doing some of 
20110115001431.000|20110115001434.000|TR0|their official business as you speak to 
20110115001434.000|20110115001436.000|TR0|us, calling some states behind you.  We'll 
20110115001436.000|20110115001438.000|TR0|listen in on that a little bit.  In the 
20110115001438.000|20110115001441.000|TR0|sense that he's in an odd way a temporary 
20110115001441.000|20110115001443.000|TR0|chairman.  By tradition, whoever the 
20110115001443.000|20110115001446.000|TR0|nominee is gets to install his or her team 
20110115001446.000|20110115001448.000|TR0|at the national committee.  Why seven 
20110115001448.000|20110115001450.000|TR0|ballots?  Was there a conflict over not 
20110115001450.000|20110115001453.000|TR0|just who, but what they needed?
20110115001453.000|20110115001455.000|TR0|
20110115001455.000|20110115001458.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Well it moved at a glacial pace 
20110115001458.000|20110115001500.000|TR0|at first, John.  A lot of the balloting 
20110115001500.000|20110115001502.000|TR0|was because there are so many candidates.  
20110115001502.000|20110115001505.000|TR0|As you know, John, Boehner supported a 
20110115001505.000|20110115001507.000|TR0|different candidate.  Priebus was a 
20110115001507.000|20110115001510.000|TR0|candidate from Wisconsin who had -- they 
20110115001510.000|20110115001512.000|TR0|had all these games this year with Ron 
20110115001512.000|20110115001514.000|TR0|Johnson replacing Russ Feingold, taking 
20110115001514.000|20110115001517.000|TR0|over the House and Senate winning the 
20110115001517.000|20110115001519.000|TR0|governor's mansion.  But still he's not a 
20110115001519.000|20110115001522.000|TR0|big public figure and so some of the 
20110115001522.000|20110115001524.000|TR0|better known candidates got a lot of votes 
20110115001524.000|20110115001526.000|TR0|early on.  But in the end, he was the guy 
20110115001526.000|20110115001529.000|TR0|that people knew was going to do the job.
20110115001529.000|20110115001531.000|TR0|
20110115001531.000|20110115001534.000|TR0|There was plenty of horse trading I'm 
20110115001534.000|20110115001536.000|TR0|sure, but once Steele bowed out, Priebus 
20110115001536.000|20110115001538.000|TR0|surged to the front and he insists that 
20110115001538.000|20110115001541.000|TR0|you know despite the citizen's united 
20110115001541.000|20110115001543.000|TR0|ruling the lets big corporations give so 
20110115001543.000|20110115001546.000|TR0|much money to groups that aren't the RNC, 
20110115001546.000|20110115001548.000|TR0|under him, he says the RNC will do the 
20110115001548.000|20110115001550.000|TR0|work of coordinating with the states, 
20110115001550.000|20110115001553.000|TR0|coordinating to go get a message out and 
20110115001553.000|20110115001555.000|TR0|delivering whoever that nominee is in 2012 
20110115001555.000|20110115001558.000|TR0|every asset they can have.  He says his 
20110115001558.000|20110115001600.000|TR0|mission is to raise $400 million between 
20110115001600.000|20110115001602.000|TR0|now and then -- John.

20110115001605.000|20110115001607.000|TR0|KING:  Ouch.  That's a lot of cash.  
20110115001607.000|20110115001610.000|TR0|Jessica Yellin for us at the RNC changing 
20110115001610.000|20110115001612.000|TR0|of the guard -- Jess, thanks.  Four 
20110115001612.000|20110115001614.000|TR0|hundred million dollars, well I was going 
20110115001614.000|20110115001617.000|TR0|to say what does that change at the top 
20110115001617.000|20110115001619.000|TR0|mean for the GOP.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
20110115001619.000|20110115001622.000|TR0|that's not change.  Let's talk that and 
20110115001622.000|20110115001624.000|TR0|other big political news over with CNN 
20110115001624.000|20110115001626.000|TR0|contributors Ed Rollins and John Avlon and

20110115001636.000|20110115001638.000|TR0|going to yield to you first.  In some ways 
20110115001638.000|20110115001641.000|TR0|it's an important job.  For anyone out 
20110115001641.000|20110115001643.000|TR0|there who is looking for a job or 
20110115001643.000|20110115001646.000|TR0|wondering about the price of gas, you know 
20110115001646.000|20110115001648.000|TR0|the chairman of the party is meaningless, 
20110115001648.000|20110115001650.000|TR0|but it is important.  Why?
20110115001650.000|20110115001653.000|TR0|
20110115001653.000|20110115001655.000|TR0|ED ROLLINS, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  
20110115001655.000|20110115001658.000|TR0|It's important because you are for the 
20110115001658.000|20110115001700.000|TR0|foreseeable future you're the face of the 
20110115001700.000|20110115001702.000|TR0|party, you're someone who basically has to 
20110115001702.000|20110115001705.000|TR0|put an apparatus together to help elect 
20110115001705.000|20110115001707.000|TR0|people and the raising of the money which 
20110115001707.000|20110115001710.000|TR0|is the critical thing. What the new 
20110115001710.000|20110115001712.000|TR0|chairman brings to the table is he's been 
20110115001712.000|20110115001714.000|TR0|around the party, he's run a very strong 
20110115001714.000|20110115001717.000|TR0|state organization.
20110115001717.000|20110115001719.000|TR0|
20110115001719.000|20110115001722.000|TR0|He was the mastermind or the campaign 
20110115001722.000|20110115001724.000|TR0|manager for Steele's election four years 
20110115001724.000|20110115001726.000|TR0|ago, so he certainly knows how to count 
20110115001726.000|20110115001729.000|TR0|votes and equally is important he's been 
20110115001729.000|20110115001731.000|TR0|the general counsel of the committee and 
20110115001731.000|20110115001734.000|TR0|the legalities of raising funds today and 
20110115001734.000|20110115001736.000|TR0|all the rest of it are so very, very 
20110115001736.000|20110115001738.000|TR0|important.  He's got to get a convention 
20110115001738.000|20110115001741.000|TR0|ready to go. He has to have some very 
20110115001741.000|20110115001743.000|TR0|important rule changes as we start the 
20110115001743.000|20110115001746.000|TR0|nominating process and all of that is not 
20110115001746.000|20110115001748.000|TR0|finalized yet.

20110115001750.000|20110115001753.000|TR0|KING:  I suspect, Amy Goodman, that second 
20110115001753.000|20110115001755.000|TR0|to Michael Steele in disappointment 
20110115001755.000|20110115001758.000|TR0|tonight is the left in America which found 
20110115001758.000|20110115001800.000|TR0|Michael Steele to be controversial and 
20110115001800.000|20110115001802.000|TR0|shall we say they welcomed some of the 
20110115001802.000|20110115001805.000|TR0|controversies he helped gin up.
20110115001805.000|20110115001807.000|TR0|
20110115001807.000|20110115001810.000|TR0|AMY GOODMAN, HOST, DEMOCRACY NOW!:  Well I 
20110115001810.000|20110115001812.000|TR0|mean when you look at what's happening, 
20110115001812.000|20110115001814.000|TR0|the discussion of $400 million Priebus is 
20110115001814.000|20110115001817.000|TR0|promising to raise, I mean the discussion 
20110115001817.000|20110115001819.000|TR0|of what President Obama will be raising to 
20110115001819.000|20110115001822.000|TR0|be reelected, we're talking about 
20110115001822.000|20110115001824.000|TR0|something over yes, gasp, $1 billion.  
20110115001824.000|20110115001826.000|TR0|It's as if the parties are no longer 
20110115001826.000|20110115001829.000|TR0|controlled by political leaders, it's by 
20110115001829.000|20110115001831.000|TR0|corporations.
20110115001831.000|20110115001834.000|TR0|
20110115001834.000|20110115001836.000|TR0|And this is of the gravest concern whether 
20110115001836.000|20110115001839.000|TR0|we're talking about you know the changing 
20110115001839.000|20110115001841.000|TR0|of the guard in the vice president's 
20110115001841.000|20110115001843.000|TR0|office, Bruce Reed, former executive 
20110115001843.000|20110115001846.000|TR0|director of the Deficit Commission as they 
20110115001846.000|20110115001848.000|TR0|take on Social Security and Medicare.  
20110115001848.000|20110115001851.000|TR0|We're talking about the U.S. Chamber of 
20110115001851.000|20110115001853.000|TR0|Commerce, the corporations, whether 
20110115001853.000|20110115001855.000|TR0|Republican, whether a Democrat.  It's not 
20110115001855.000|20110115001858.000|TR0|really about two parties anymore.  It's 
20110115001858.000|20110115001900.000|TR0|about the big moneyed interests in this 
20110115001900.000|20110115001903.000|TR0|country and that's what has to be 
20110115001903.000|20110115001905.000|TR0|challenged.       KING:  John Avlon, Amy 
20110115001905.000|20110115001907.000|TR0|makes an interesting point.  Let's say 
20110115001907.000|20110115001910.000|TR0|you're some rank and file Republican out 
20110115001910.000|20110115001912.000|TR0|there, some conservative out in America 
20110115001912.000|20110115001915.000|TR0|that maybe didn't cut a check for $50 to 
20110115001915.000|20110115001917.000|TR0|the RNC because you read about this 
20110115001917.000|20110115001919.000|TR0|Michael Steele controversy and you said 
20110115001919.000|20110115001922.000|TR0|well the people are telling me not to send 
20110115001922.000|20110115001924.000|TR0|him the money.  Do you think now your 50 
20110115001924.000|20110115001927.000|TR0|or $100 check for the average Joe who 
20110115001927.000|20110115001929.000|TR0|might want to have their voice in politics 
20110115001929.000|20110115001931.000|TR0|at a time when, as Amy notes, the Obama 
20110115001931.000|20110115001934.000|TR0|people are talking about $1 billion and 
20110115001934.000|20110115001936.000|TR0|this guy is going to raise $400 million. 
20110115001936.000|20110115001939.000|TR0|That little check for 50 bucks doesn't 
20110115001939.000|20110115001941.000|TR0|seem like much.
20110115001941.000|20110115001943.000|TR0|
20110115001943.000|20110115001946.000|TR0|JOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, the 
20110115001946.000|20110115001948.000|TR0|widow's (ph) might has gone a little bit 
20110115001948.000|20110115001951.000|TR0|out of fashion, but I think it's still 
20110115001951.000|20110115001953.000|TR0|important.  I mean these parties are 
20110115001953.000|20110115001955.000|TR0|trying to build, they're sort of a bench 
20110115001955.000|20110115001958.000|TR0|team and that requires small donations.  
20110115001958.000|20110115002000.000|TR0|There was a lack of confidence in Michael 
20110115002000.000|20110115002003.000|TR0|Steele's leadership of the RNC 
20110115002003.000|20110115002005.000|TR0|specifically on the bookkeeping, the 
20110115002005.000|20110115002007.000|TR0|fundraising.  And you saw money going to 
20110115002007.000|20110115002010.000|TR0|other organizations not just in reaction 
20110115002010.000|20110115002012.000|TR0|to Citizens United decision, but in 
20110115002012.000|20110115002015.000|TR0|reaction to the fact that folks thought 
20110115002015.000|20110115002017.000|TR0|maybe they were getting more bang for 
20110115002017.000|20110115002019.000|TR0|their buck outside that apparatus.
20110115002019.000|20110115002022.000|TR0|
20110115002022.000|20110115002024.000|TR0|This is an attempt to reset.  This is an 
20110115002024.000|20110115002027.000|TR0|attempt for confidence instead of charisma 
20110115002027.000|20110115002029.000|TR0|and Michael Steele showed it dominated so 
20110115002029.000|20110115002031.000|TR0|many headlines.  But this guy's done an 
20110115002031.000|20110115002034.000|TR0|amazing job turning around the state party 
20110115002034.000|20110115002036.000|TR0|in Wisconsin and I think that's what 
20110115002036.000|20110115002039.000|TR0|they're hoping he can replicate at a 
20110115002039.000|20110115002041.000|TR0|national level.  We'll see.
20110115002041.000|20110115002043.000|TR0|
20110115002043.000|20110115002046.000|TR0|KING:  And, Ed, John makes the key point.  
20110115002046.000|20110115002048.000|TR0|Here's a guy who they just -- the 
20110115002048.000|20110115002051.000|TR0|Republicans just took back the 
20110115002051.000|20110115002053.000|TR0|governorship of Wisconsin. They hadn't 
20110115002053.000|20110115002055.000|TR0|held that for a while.  They just knocked 
20110115002055.000|20110115002058.000|TR0|off one of Amy's good friends, Senator 
20110115002058.000|20110115002100.000|TR0|Russ Feingold.  And so he could come to 
20110115002100.000|20110115002103.000|TR0|the table saying if this is about winning 
20110115002103.000|20110115002105.000|TR0|tough states, winning blue collar states, 
20110115002105.000|20110115002107.000|TR0|winning states that were blue -- just 
20110115002107.000|20110115002110.000|TR0|leave it at blue -- in the last 
20110115002110.000|20110115002112.000|TR0|presidential election, I'm a guy who has 
20110115002112.000|20110115002115.000|TR0|got some experience.
20110115002115.000|20110115002117.000|TR0|
20110115002117.000|20110115002119.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  Well I think it's a very 
20110115002119.000|20110115002122.000|TR0|important thing.  Equally as important -- 
20110115002122.000|20110115002124.000|TR0|and I want to say this to Amy -- it's not 
20110115002124.000|20110115002127.000|TR0|all corporate money.  Obama who basically 
20110115002127.000|20110115002129.000|TR0|is the first president since the fed 
20110115002129.000|20110115002131.000|TR0|election laws were in existence after the 
20110115002131.000|20110115002134.000|TR0|'72 Watergate year was the guy who said I 
20110115002134.000|20110115002136.000|TR0|don't want public money; I'm going to 
20110115002136.000|20110115002139.000|TR0|raise my own. And a lot of that was online.
20110115002139.000|20110115002141.000|TR0|
20110115002141.000|20110115002143.000|TR0|A lot of it was smaller donors and a lot 
20110115002143.000|20110115002146.000|TR0|of the money that we're talking about 
20110115002146.000|20110115002148.000|TR0|raising in this will cycle will be from 
20110115002148.000|20110115002151.000|TR0|smaller donors. So if you're a small 
20110115002151.000|20110115002153.000|TR0|donor, you have to have confidence that 
20110115002153.000|20110115002155.000|TR0|your money is going to be spent well, but 
20110115002155.000|20110115002158.000|TR0|this big money is going to be there, too, 
20110115002158.000|20110115002200.000|TR0|because it costs a lot of money to run 
20110115002200.000|20110115002203.000|TR0|campaigns today.

20110115002210.000|20110115002212.000|TR0|GOODMAN:  Just look at the midterm 
20110115002212.000|20110115002215.000|TR0|elections and look how much money was 
20110115002215.000|20110115002217.000|TR0|spent and how much undisclosed.  We don't 
20110115002217.000|20110115002219.000|TR0|even know who gave this money.  This is 
20110115002219.000|20110115002222.000|TR0|why the Chamber of Commerce is rejoicing 
20110115002222.000|20110115002224.000|TR0|and while the people of this country, 
20110115002224.000|20110115002227.000|TR0|democracy, is really at risk.
20110115002227.000|20110115002229.000|TR0|
20110115002229.000|20110115002231.000|TR0|KING:  All right --      ROLLINS:  It's 
20110115002231.000|20110115002234.000|TR0|not at risk.  The bottom line is you have 
20110115002234.000|20110115002236.000|TR0|an election every two years.  People get 
20110115002236.000|20110115002239.000|TR0|to go out and vote.  It's about 
20110115002239.000|20110115002241.000|TR0|communication.  No one was defeated this 
20110115002241.000|20110115002243.000|TR0|time, no Democratic incumbent lost because 
20110115002243.000|20110115002246.000|TR0|he was badly outspent.  Both sides had 
20110115002246.000|20110115002248.000|TR0|resources to go out in competitive races.

20110115002255.000|20110115002258.000|TR0|GOODMAN:  I agree with you the problem is 
20110115002258.000|20110115002300.000|TR0|both sides.  It's going across the board 
20110115002300.000|20110115002303.000|TR0|here, Democrat and Republican.  Money is 
20110115002303.000|20110115002305.000|TR0|swamping politics in this country.

20110115002439.000|20110115002441.000|TR0|LePage's decision to inflame racial 
20110115002441.000|20110115002444.000|TR0|attention on the eve of the King Holiday 
20110115002444.000|20110115002446.000|TR0|denigrates his office."
20110115002446.000|20110115002448.000|TR0|
20110115002448.000|20110115002451.000|TR0|Let's get the take of Ed Rollins, John 
20110115002451.000|20110115002453.000|TR0|Avlon and Amy Goodman. John Avlon, you 
20110115002453.000|20110115002456.000|TR0|used to be a speechwriter, this guy needs 
20110115002456.000|20110115002458.000|TR0|a little help.
20110115002458.000|20110115002500.000|TR0|
20110115002500.000|20110115002503.000|TR0|AVLON:  Yes, I don't think he's really 
20110115002503.000|20110115002505.000|TR0|going for eloquence, is he.  This is not 
20110115002505.000|20110115002508.000|TR0|the first time Paul LePage has used this 
20110115002508.000|20110115002510.000|TR0|kind of language and got a lot of press 
20110115002510.000|20110115002512.000|TR0|both negative -- mostly negative for it.  
20110115002512.000|20110115002515.000|TR0|Earlier in the campaign he attracted 
20110115002515.000|20110115002517.000|TR0|attention for saying that as governor he 
20110115002517.000|20110115002520.000|TR0|would tell President Obama to go to hell.
20110115002520.000|20110115002522.000|TR0|
20110115002522.000|20110115002524.000|TR0|I think there are two issues here.  One is 
20110115002524.000|20110115002527.000|TR0|just the wisdom of a governor in the 21st 
20110115002527.000|20110115002529.000|TR0|Century to make a point of not attending 
20110115002529.000|20110115002532.000|TR0|Martin Luther King Day celebrations.  Not 
20110115002532.000|20110115002534.000|TR0|quite sure what message he's trying to 
20110115002534.000|20110115002536.000|TR0|send there.  This message is real clear 
20110115002536.000|20110115002539.000|TR0|though he's trying to throw a bomb, get 
20110115002539.000|20110115002541.000|TR0|some attention and show that he doesn't 
20110115002541.000|20110115002544.000|TR0|care what the NAACP thinks.
20110115002544.000|20110115002546.000|TR0|
20110115002546.000|20110115002548.000|TR0|This is going to be a bad fit for Maine.  
20110115002548.000|20110115002551.000|TR0|Here's a state where Independents 
20110115002551.000|20110115002553.000|TR0|outnumber Democrats, Republicans.  He was 
20110115002553.000|20110115002556.000|TR0|narrowly elected in a three-way race.  
20110115002556.000|20110115002558.000|TR0|This is not going to wear well in Maine is 
20110115002558.000|20110115002600.000|TR0|my guess.
20110115002600.000|20110115002603.000|TR0|
20110115002603.000|20110115002605.000|TR0|KING:  John mentioned picking a fight with 
20110115002605.000|20110115002608.000|TR0|the NAACP; let me read a little bit more 
20110115002608.000|20110115002610.000|TR0|of how he described the NAACP today.  He 
20110115002610.000|20110115002612.000|TR0|said "they are a special interest, end of 
20110115002612.000|20110115002615.000|TR0|story, and I'm not going to be held 
20110115002615.000|20110115002617.000|TR0|hostage by special interests.  If they 
20110115002617.000|20110115002620.000|TR0|want they can look at my family picture.  
20110115002620.000|20110115002622.000|TR0|My son happens to be black, so they can do 
20110115002622.000|20110115002624.000|TR0|whatever they like about it."
20110115002624.000|20110115002627.000|TR0|
20110115002627.000|20110115002629.000|TR0|Let's show our viewers the picture of the 
20110115002629.000|20110115002632.000|TR0|LePage family; he does have an adopted 
20110115002632.000|20110115002634.000|TR0|son.  His son is from Jamaica.  You see 
20110115002634.000|20110115002636.000|TR0|him in the photo here.  He is adopted.  
20110115002636.000|20110115002639.000|TR0|But, Amy, OK, he has an adopted son, amen 
20110115002639.000|20110115002641.000|TR0|to him for that, but why pick this fight?
20110115002641.000|20110115002644.000|TR0|
20110115002644.000|20110115002646.000|TR0|GOODMAN:  Oh I mean that's a very good 
20110115002646.000|20110115002648.000|TR0|question and whether we're talking about 
20110115002648.000|20110115002651.000|TR0|Maine or where all our hearts are in 
20110115002651.000|20110115002653.000|TR0|Arizona, one of the last states to approve 
20110115002653.000|20110115002656.000|TR0|the Martin Luther King holiday, I think as 
20110115002656.000|20110115002658.000|TR0|we reflect on what Dr. King represented, 
20110115002658.000|20110115002700.000|TR0|as he took on violence abroad -- at that 
20110115002700.000|20110115002703.000|TR0|time it was the Vietnam War -- and 
20110115002703.000|20110115002705.000|TR0|violence at home, decrying it all.  In 
20110115002705.000|20110115002708.000|TR0|Arizona now as we move forward, the 
20110115002708.000|20110115002710.000|TR0|questions are how they're going to deal 
20110115002710.000|20110115002712.000|TR0|with the violence there, whether we're 
20110115002712.000|20110115002715.000|TR0|talking about the lack of control of guns, 
20110115002715.000|20110115002717.000|TR0|whether we're talking about the hatred of 
20110115002717.000|20110115002720.000|TR0|immigrants that has been expressed.  I 
20110115002720.000|20110115002722.000|TR0|hope now we're going to start seeing a 
20110115002722.000|20110115002724.000|TR0|serious coming together and really show 
20110115002724.000|20110115002727.000|TR0|respect for the hero of the day there, 
20110115002727.000|20110115002729.000|TR0|that young Danny Hernandez, the 
20110115002729.000|20110115002732.000|TR0|20-year-old Mexican American who has so 
20110115002732.000|20110115002734.000|TR0|much to teach us all.
20110115002734.000|20110115002736.000|TR0|
20110115002736.000|20110115002739.000|TR0|KING:  Amy raises an interesting point, 
20110115002739.000|20110115002741.000|TR0|Ed.  We're going to learn a lot more next 
20110115002741.000|20110115002744.000|TR0|week when the health care debate resumes 
20110115002744.000|20110115002746.000|TR0|in the Congress about whether there is a 
20110115002746.000|20110115002749.000|TR0|lesson.  I'm not going to try to connect 
20110115002749.000|20110115002751.000|TR0|any dots tonight.  I don't connect any 
20110115002751.000|20110115002753.000|TR0|dots to any pre event rhetoric to what 
20110115002753.000|20110115002756.000|TR0|happened in Arizona, but there is a 
20110115002756.000|20110115002758.000|TR0|national conversation about can we all be 
20110115002758.000|20110115002801.000|TR0|a little smarter, a little more civil.  
20110115002801.000|20110115002803.000|TR0|Can we debate on the issues and not 
20110115002803.000|20110115002805.000|TR0|question people's personal integrity.
20110115002805.000|20110115002808.000|TR0|
20110115002808.000|20110115002810.000|TR0|I want you to listen to Jeb Bush, the 
20110115002810.000|20110115002813.000|TR0|former governor of Florida; he was here in 
20110115002813.000|20110115002815.000|TR0|the D.C. area today speaking to a 
20110115002815.000|20110115002817.000|TR0|conference trying to convince Latinos to 
20110115002817.000|20110115002820.000|TR0|give the Republican Party another look 
20110115002820.000|20110115002822.000|TR0|after he talked about his take on how he 
20110115002822.000|20110115002825.000|TR0|hopes the tone will change.
20110115002825.000|20110115002827.000|TR0|

20110115002832.000|20110115002834.000|TR0|JEB BUSH (R), FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR:  
20110115002834.000|20110115002837.000|TR0|You don't have to personalize your 
20110115002837.000|20110115002839.000|TR0|disagreements with people.  You don't have 
20110115002839.000|20110115002841.000|TR0|to tear down the other person.  Your ideas 
20110115002841.000|20110115002844.000|TR0|should have enough merit to be able to win 
20110115002844.000|20110115002846.000|TR0|the day.  And so I hope that the Tucson 
20110115002846.000|20110115002849.000|TR0|experience, the reaction to the reaction 
20110115002849.000|20110115002851.000|TR0|helps us get to a better place politically.

20110115002858.000|20110115002901.000|TR0|KING:  A thoughtful statement there from 
20110115002901.000|20110115002903.000|TR0|Jeb Bush, Ed Rollins, but by the middle of 
20110115002903.000|20110115002905.000|TR0|next week when health care is back on the 
20110115002905.000|20110115002908.000|TR0|floor, will we back in our normal vitriol?
20110115002908.000|20110115002910.000|TR0|
20110115002910.000|20110115002913.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  Well we may not be next week, 
20110115002913.000|20110115002915.000|TR0|but certainly we're going to have some 
20110115002915.000|20110115002917.000|TR0|strong arguments because people feel very 
20110115002917.000|20110115002920.000|TR0|passionate on different sides of this 
20110115002920.000|20110115002922.000|TR0|issue.  You know I think as time goes on 
20110115002922.000|20110115002925.000|TR0|we'll get back to the rhetoric again 
20110115002925.000|20110115002927.000|TR0|unfortunately.  The Martin Luther King 
20110115002927.000|20110115002929.000|TR0|holiday was a very interesting test.  I 
20110115002929.000|20110115002932.000|TR0|was in the White House when President 
20110115002932.000|20110115002934.000|TR0|Reagan signed that bill.  I was on his 
20110115002934.000|20110115002937.000|TR0|side when he signed it.
20110115002937.000|20110115002939.000|TR0|
20110115002939.000|20110115002941.000|TR0|There was a lot of controversy.  There 
20110115002941.000|20110115002944.000|TR0|were people in his cabinet, the late 
20110115002944.000|20110115002946.000|TR0|attorney general was very opposed to it.  
20110115002946.000|20110115002949.000|TR0|And so you know he basically thought 
20110115002949.000|20110115002951.000|TR0|Martin Luther King was a very important 
20110115002951.000|20110115002953.000|TR0|leader.  He did something that was very 
20110115002953.000|20110115002956.000|TR0|courageous in signing that bill and he 
20110115002956.000|20110115002958.000|TR0|stood above it -- the discourse.  I think 
20110115002958.000|20110115003001.000|TR0|what Republicans have to do is they're now 
20110115003001.000|20110115003003.000|TR0|in a leadership position, at least in one 
20110115003003.000|20110115003005.000|TR0|House, is to basically keep the rhetoric 
20110115003005.000|20110115003008.000|TR0|down and go do the job.
20110115003008.000|20110115003010.000|TR0|
20110115003010.000|20110115003013.000|TR0|KING:  John, do you think that's what will 
20110115003013.000|20110115003015.000|TR0|happen?  I was talking to Jeff Flake last 
20110115003015.000|20110115003017.000|TR0|night of Arizona.  Now he is a 
20110115003017.000|20110115003020.000|TR0|conservative.  He fights earmarks.  He's a 
20110115003020.000|20110115003022.000|TR0|fiscal conservative (INAUDIBLE) he's not 
20110115003022.000|20110115003025.000|TR0|one who tends to throw around a lot of 
20110115003025.000|20110115003027.000|TR0|flowery rhetoric, but he was very somber.  
20110115003027.000|20110115003029.000|TR0|He'd just come from the funeral of the 
20110115003029.000|20110115003032.000|TR0|9-year-old victim and he said that he 
20110115003032.000|20110115003034.000|TR0|hoped all of his colleagues would -- you 
20110115003034.000|20110115003037.000|TR0|know let's have a spirited fight about 
20110115003037.000|20110115003039.000|TR0|health care.  Let's have a spirited fight

20110115003041.000|20110115003044.000|TR0|spending, but let's make it about the 
20110115003044.000|20110115003046.000|TR0|specifics, not questioning people's 
20110115003046.000|20110115003049.000|TR0|character and judgment.  Will we?

20110115003051.000|20110115003053.000|TR0|AVLON:  That's essential.  And the 
20110115003053.000|20110115003056.000|TR0|Republican Party should listen to Jeff 
20110115003056.000|20110115003058.000|TR0|Flake and other folks like that.  You know 
20110115003058.000|20110115003101.000|TR0|we -- the American people sent a pretty 
20110115003101.000|20110115003103.000|TR0|clear message.  I think they sent one 
20110115003103.000|20110115003105.000|TR0|during the election, but even more so in 
20110115003105.000|20110115003108.000|TR0|the aftermath of Tucson.  They're 
20110115003108.000|20110115003110.000|TR0|expecting something different, something 
20110115003110.000|20110115003113.000|TR0|better from Washington.

20110115003115.000|20110115003117.000|TR0|This demonizing people who disagree with

20110115003122.000|20110115003125.000|TR0|translated into threats against 
20110115003125.000|20110115003127.000|TR0|congressmen from both parties that it's up 
20110115003127.000|20110115003129.000|TR0|to the Republicans to be part of the 
20110115003129.000|20110115003132.000|TR0|solution here and to show they really 
20110115003132.000|20110115003134.000|TR0|heard it and help turn the page, get to

20110115003153.000|20110115003156.000|TR0|requires common ground and not burning

20110115003213.000|20110115003215.000|TR0|who is so desperately trying to survive 
20110115003215.000|20110115003218.000|TR0|fighting for her life right now, the 
20110115003218.000|20110115003220.000|TR0|Republicans push for the repeal of the 
20110115003220.000|20110115003222.000|TR0|health care bill when she voted for it. 
20110115003222.000|20110115003225.000|TR0|Her -- the glass door of her office in 
20110115003225.000|20110115003227.000|TR0|Tucson was either shot through or 
20110115003227.000|20110115003230.000|TR0|shattered.  And also I think one of the 
20110115003230.000|20110115003232.000|TR0|first acts when they come back in honor of 
20110115003232.000|20110115003234.000|TR0|all of those victims and to stop future 
20110115003234.000|20110115003237.000|TR0|ones is to pass Carolyn McCarthy's bill 
20110115003237.000|20110115003239.000|TR0|that she has been pushing for every single 
20110115003239.000|20110115003242.000|TR0|year and that is a ban on assault weapons.

20110115003301.000|20110115003303.000|TR0|example in the way she conducted herself 
20110115003303.000|20110115003306.000|TR0|in office of the kind of change I think 
20110115003306.000|20110115003308.000|TR0|Congress needs to learn from.  Take a page 
20110115003308.000|20110115003310.000|TR0|from Gabby Giffords' playbook.  Be that -- 
20110115003310.000|20110115003313.000|TR0|you know someone who is a strong centrist 
20110115003313.000|20110115003315.000|TR0|Democrat who tried to reach across the 
20110115003315.000|20110115003318.000|TR0|aisle to solve problems.  That's an 
20110115003318.000|20110115003320.000|TR0|example that folks in Congress they want 
20110115003320.000|20110115003322.000|TR0|to really honor her.  Take that example to 
20110115003322.000|20110115003325.000|TR0|heart in trying to govern over the next 
20110115003325.000|20110115003327.000|TR0|two years.

20110115003337.000|20110115003339.000|TR0|though.

20110115003346.000|20110115003349.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  Quickly -- Democrats for four 
20110115003349.000|20110115003351.000|TR0|years controlled both the House and the 
20110115003351.000|20110115003354.000|TR0|Senate.  If they wanted to pass gun 
20110115003354.000|20110115003356.000|TR0|control, they could have done it.  You had 
20110115003356.000|20110115003358.000|TR0|a Democratic president who obviously would 
20110115003358.000|20110115003401.000|TR0|have signed it.  He didn't.  The bottom 
20110115003401.000|20110115003403.000|TR0|line today is the Second Amendment is the 
20110115003403.000|20110115003406.000|TR0|Supreme Court has decided it is the law of 
20110115003406.000|20110115003408.000|TR0|the land and I don't think there's a 
20110115003408.000|20110115003410.000|TR0|majority of Democrats and certainly not a 
20110115003410.000|20110115003413.000|TR0|majority of Republicans that are going to 
20110115003413.000|20110115003415.000|TR0|alter that.

20110115003418.000|20110115003420.000|TR0|GOODMAN:  I want to say Ed's right that 
20110115003420.000|20110115003422.000|TR0|the Democrats could have done it, should 
20110115003422.000|20110115003425.000|TR0|have done it, and they still can with the 
20110115003425.000|20110115003427.000|TR0|Republicans. And when the founding fathers 
20110115003427.000|20110115003430.000|TR0|had their guns at home and were loading 
20110115003430.000|20110115003432.000|TR0|one bullet at a time, what would it take, 
20110115003432.000|20110115003434.000|TR0|something like five minutes, they never 
20110115003434.000|20110115003437.000|TR0|had any dream that people today could load 
20110115003437.000|20110115003439.000|TR0|in magazines and shoot off how many 
20110115003439.000|20110115003442.000|TR0|bullets a minute.  I think we should take 
20110115003442.000|20110115003444.000|TR0|what the founding fathers' intent was all 
20110115003444.000|20110115003446.000|TR0|about and we should protect the people of 
20110115003446.000|20110115003449.000|TR0|this country.

20110115003454.000|20110115003456.000|TR0|earlier.  I want to bring it up.  The vice 
20110115003456.000|20110115003458.000|TR0|president of the United States today hired 
20110115003458.000|20110115003501.000|TR0|a new chief of staff.  He is Bruce Reed.  
20110115003501.000|20110115003503.000|TR0|He worked in the Clinton administration.  
20110115003503.000|20110115003506.000|TR0|He was a leading member of the Democratic 
20110115003506.000|20110115003508.000|TR0|Leadership Council for a long time, back 
20110115003508.000|20110115003510.000|TR0|in the '90s.  A centrist organization that 
20110115003510.000|20110115003513.000|TR0|was founded on the basic principle that 
20110115003513.000|20110115003515.000|TR0|the Democratic Party had become too 
20110115003515.000|20110115003518.000|TR0|liberal, too big spending, too high 
20110115003518.000|20110115003520.000|TR0|taxing.  You -- the White House, they view 
20110115003520.000|20110115003522.000|TR0|this as bringing in a seasoned policy guy 
20110115003522.000|20110115003525.000|TR0|to help the vice president.  You don't see 
20110115003525.000|20110115003527.000|TR0|it that way.
20110115003527.000|20110115003530.000|TR0|
20110115003530.000|20110115003532.000|TR0|GOODMAN:  Oh, no.  Whether we're talking 
20110115003532.000|20110115003534.000|TR0|about Daley representing the banks or 
20110115003534.000|20110115003537.000|TR0|whether we're talking about Bruce Reed 
20110115003537.000|20110115003539.000|TR0|going after Social Security and Medicare.  
20110115003539.000|20110115003542.000|TR0|I think most people in this country, the 
20110115003542.000|20110115003544.000|TR0|polls show, absolutely support keeping 
20110115003544.000|20110115003546.000|TR0|Social Security and Medicare.  But I have 
20110115003546.000|20110115003549.000|TR0|to make one more point as we honor the 
20110115003549.000|20110115003551.000|TR0|dead, as we honor the wounded.  There is a 
20110115003551.000|20110115003554.000|TR0|young woman also killed this past week and 
20110115003554.000|20110115003556.000|TR0|she was in Mexico.   Her name was Sassana 
20110115003556.000|20110115003558.000|TR0|(ph) Chavez.   And she fought violence in 
20110115003558.000|20110115003601.000|TR0|Ciudad Juarez, one of the most violent 
20110115003601.000|20110115003603.000|TR0|places on earth. The reason-and President 
20110115003603.000|20110115003606.000|TR0|Calderon has said this over and over-that 
20110115003606.000|20110115003608.000|TR0|the guns are there is because of the 
20110115003608.000|20110115003610.000|TR0|sunset of the ban on the assault weapons 
20110115003610.000|20110115003613.000|TR0|in this country in 2004. It's got to stop.

20110115003620.000|20110115003622.000|TR0|AVLON:  Bruce Reed, this is a great pick 
20110115003622.000|20110115003625.000|TR0|up by the vice president, in my opinion.  
20110115003625.000|20110115003627.000|TR0|It shows a really - that they have gotten 
20110115003627.000|20110115003630.000|TR0|the election.  It's one more sign that the 
20110115003630.000|20110115003632.000|TR0|Obama administration understands the 
20110115003632.000|20110115003634.000|TR0|message of the election.  It understands 
20110115003634.000|20110115003637.000|TR0|the responsibility of governing with a 
20110115003637.000|20110115003639.000|TR0|divided Congress.  And they're pivoting 
20110115003639.000|20110115003642.000|TR0|towards 2012.  The fact that he was one of 
20110115003642.000|20110115003644.000|TR0|the leaders in the deficit reduction 
20110115003644.000|20110115003646.000|TR0|commission shows that they understand they 
20110115003646.000|20110115003649.000|TR0|need to really lead on this issue to 
20110115003649.000|20110115003651.000|TR0|restore their credibility with centrist 
20110115003651.000|20110115003654.000|TR0|and independent voters.  And the only way 
20110115003654.000|20110115003656.000|TR0|to keep Social Security alive for future 
20110115003656.000|20110115003659.000|TR0|generations, my generation in particular, 
20110115003659.000|20110115003701.000|TR0|is to reform it.  It is not optional.  
20110115003701.000|20110115003703.000|TR0|We're going bankrupt unless you deal with 
20110115003703.000|20110115003706.000|TR0|the excesses.  The math simply doesn't 
20110115003706.000|20110115003708.000|TR0|work.  So it's a great sign, it's a 
20110115003708.000|20110115003711.000|TR0|responsible action.  It is exactly the 
20110115003711.000|20110115003713.000|TR0|kind of thing they need to do to have a 
20110115003713.000|20110115003715.000|TR0|successful two years and pivot towards 
20110115003715.000|20110115003718.000|TR0|2012.

20110115003720.000|20110115003723.000|TR0|KING:  A disagreement, but for the record, 
20110115003723.000|20110115003725.000|TR0|I will note, polite and civil.  And on the 
20110115003725.000|20110115003727.000|TR0|substance between Ms. Goodman and Mr. 
20110115003727.000|20110115003730.000|TR0|Avlon. Amy and John have a great weekend.  
20110115003730.000|20110115003732.000|TR0|Ed is going to stay with us, because when 
20110115003732.000|20110115003735.000|TR0|we come back we need Ed's expertise to go 
20110115003735.000|20110115003737.000|TR0|through another big story in our politics 
20110115003737.000|20110115003739.000|TR0|today and that is a bit of a bomb shell 
20110115003739.000|20110115003742.000|TR0|from the son of the late President Ronald 
20110115003742.000|20110115003744.000|TR0|Reagan.  Did the president have 
20110115003744.000|20110115003747.000|TR0|Alzheimer's when in office?  We'll talk 
20110115003747.000|20110115003749.000|TR0|about that in just a minute.

20110115003754.000|20110115003756.000|TR0|billion of your money has been spent on a 
20110115003756.000|20110115003759.000|TR0|virtual fence along the U.S./Mexican 
20110115003759.000|20110115003801.000|TR0|border.  The Obama administration just 
20110115003801.000|20110115003803.000|TR0|today, pulled the plug.  Was it a virtual 
20110115003803.000|20110115003806.000|TR0|disaster?
20110115003806.000|20110115003808.000|TR0|

20110115003827.000|20110115003830.000|TR0|KING:  Back in November 1994, nearly six 
20110115003830.000|20110115003832.000|TR0|years after he left office, former 
20110115003832.000|20110115003835.000|TR0|President Ronald Reagan issued a statement 
20110115003835.000|20110115003837.000|TR0|disclosing he had recently been diagnosed 
20110115003837.000|20110115003839.000|TR0|with Alzheimer's disease.  A few years 
20110115003839.000|20110115003842.000|TR0|later, Nancy Reagan authorized White House 
20110115003842.000|20110115003844.000|TR0|doctors to talk to "The New York Times" to 
20110115003844.000|20110115003847.000|TR0|knock down suggestions he had symptoms of 
20110115003847.000|20110115003849.000|TR0|the disease while still in office.  But 
20110115003849.000|20110115003851.000|TR0|now Ron Reagan, suggests in a new book, 
20110115003851.000|20110115003854.000|TR0|that his father did have Alzheimer's while 
20110115003854.000|20110115003856.000|TR0|president.  The book, "My Father at 100" 
20110115003856.000|20110115003859.000|TR0|is due out next week.  And Ron Reagan sat 
20110115003859.000|20110115003901.000|TR0|down with ABC's Elizabeth Vargas to 
20110115003901.000|20110115003903.000|TR0|discuss it, including his blockbuster 
20110115003903.000|20110115003906.000|TR0|suggestion.

20110115003911.000|20110115003913.000|TR0|SON OF FMR. PRES. RONALD REAGAN:  I 
20110115003913.000|20110115003915.000|TR0|noticed that at the margins, there's 
20110115003915.000|20110115003918.000|TR0|something going on here that I'm not 
20110115003918.000|20110115003920.000|TR0|entirely comfortable with.  Nobody at that 
20110115003920.000|20110115003923.000|TR0|time knew Alzheimer's the way we know it 
20110115003923.000|20110115003925.000|TR0|now.  I'm not aware of anybody who thought 
20110115003925.000|20110115003927.000|TR0|he had Alzheimer's when he was in office.

20110115003935.000|20110115003937.000|TR0|KING:  I spoke by telephone today with 
20110115003937.000|20110115003939.000|TR0|President Reagan's final chief of staff 
20110115003939.000|20110115003942.000|TR0|Kenneth Duberstein, who forcefully 
20110115003942.000|20110115003944.000|TR0|challenged Ron Reagan's assertion.
20110115003944.000|20110115003947.000|TR0|
20110115003947.000|20110115003949.000|TR0|Quote, "I think Ron these days is mostly 
20110115003949.000|20110115003951.000|TR0|in the business of trying to sell books.  
20110115003951.000|20110115003954.000|TR0|That is what I think.  Day in, day out 
20110115003954.000|20110115003956.000|TR0|from beginning to end, he was in command.  
20110115003956.000|20110115003959.000|TR0|He was fully in command."
20110115003959.000|20110115004001.000|TR0|
20110115004001.000|20110115004003.000|TR0|That's Ken Duberstein's view.  Back with 
20110115004003.000|20110115004006.000|TR0|us now is one of the former president's 
20110115004006.000|20110115004008.000|TR0|closest political advisers.  Ed Rollins 
20110115004008.000|20110115004011.000|TR0|served Ronald Reagan as governor of 
20110115004011.000|20110115004013.000|TR0|California.  And after a lead role in the 
20110115004013.000|20110115004015.000|TR0|1980 presidential campaign, came to 
20110115004015.000|20110115004018.000|TR0|Washington to serve as political director 
20110115004018.000|20110115004020.000|TR0|in the Reagan White House.
20110115004020.000|20110115004023.000|TR0|
20110115004023.000|20110115004025.000|TR0|Ed Rollins, a simple question straight up. 
20110115004025.000|20110115004027.000|TR0| Did Ron Reagan have anything to base that 
20110115004027.000|20110115004030.000|TR0|on?
20110115004030.000|20110115004032.000|TR0|
20110115004032.000|20110115004035.000|TR0|ED ROLLINS, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  
20110115004035.000|20110115004037.000|TR0|No.  Let me just say this, though, Ronald 
20110115004037.000|20110115004039.000|TR0|Reagan's entire presidency, he was a man 
20110115004039.000|20110115004042.000|TR0|in his 70s.  He turned 70 and three weeks 
20110115004042.000|20110115004044.000|TR0|after he was inaugurated, he was 78 when 
20110115004044.000|20110115004047.000|TR0|he went out of office.  He was near 
20110115004047.000|20110115004049.000|TR0|mortally wounded three months in to the 
20110115004049.000|20110115004051.000|TR0|administration.  He had cancer, he had a 
20110115004051.000|20110115004054.000|TR0|head injury, and more fundamental than 
20110115004054.000|20110115004056.000|TR0|anything else, he was deaf in one ear and 
20110115004056.000|20110115004059.000|TR0|didn't get a hearing aid until midway 
20110115004059.000|20110115004101.000|TR0|through his term.
20110115004101.000|20110115004103.000|TR0|
20110115004103.000|20110115004106.000|TR0|I was in both the first and second 
20110115004106.000|20110115004108.000|TR0|administration.  I always felt he was in 
20110115004108.000|20110115004111.000|TR0|command.  He got a little bit older, 
20110115004111.000|20110115004113.000|TR0|obviously, as anyone does as you age in 
20110115004113.000|20110115004115.000|TR0|your 70s, but he clearly knew what was 
20110115004115.000|20110115004118.000|TR0|going on. But another fundamental factor 
20110115004118.000|20110115004120.000|TR0|and Ken was a dear friend of mine, there 
20110115004120.000|20110115004123.000|TR0|were four chiefs of staff in the second 
20110115004123.000|20110115004125.000|TR0|term.  There were four national security 
20110115004125.000|20110115004128.000|TR0|advisers.  There were a lot of people who 
20110115004128.000|20110115004130.000|TR0|changed and were around him and to a 
20110115004130.000|20110115004132.000|TR0|certain extent it was a troubled time for 
20110115004132.000|20110115004135.000|TR0|Reagan with Iran Contra.  I don't know 
20110115004135.000|20110115004137.000|TR0|where Ron Jr. came up with his father 
20110115004137.000|20110115004140.000|TR0|slipping other than of other than aging.  
20110115004140.000|20110115004142.000|TR0|And I think that happens to any parent who 
20110115004142.000|20110115004144.000|TR0|ages.
20110115004144.000|20110115004147.000|TR0|
20110115004147.000|20110115004149.000|TR0|But Ronald Reagan was not-and I had sat, 
20110115004149.000|20110115004152.000|TR0|my last time with him in 1990, when I was 
20110115004152.000|20110115004154.000|TR0|running a congressional committee, he did 
20110115004154.000|20110115004156.000|TR0|a fund raiser, and I sat next to him.  And 
20110115004156.000|20110115004159.000|TR0|we had this hour and a half long 
20110115004159.000|20110115004201.000|TR0|discussion, very clear minded about the 
20110115004201.000|20110115004204.000|TR0|first Gulf invasion, the Kuwait war.  And 
20110115004204.000|20110115004206.000|TR0|he knew everything that was going on.  So 
20110115004206.000|20110115004208.000|TR0|I would challenge -- not that he didn't 
20110115004208.000|20110115004211.000|TR0|age, not that he didn't slip, as any of us 
20110115004211.000|20110115004213.000|TR0|do, but I would challenge and agree with 
20110115004213.000|20110115004216.000|TR0|Ken Duberstein, that Ronald Reagan, to the 
20110115004216.000|20110115004218.000|TR0|end, was in charge.
20110115004218.000|20110115004220.000|TR0|
20110115004220.000|20110115004223.000|TR0|KING:  I want to show some of our viewers 
20110115004223.000|20110115004225.000|TR0|some of the contrasts. And I want your 
20110115004225.000|20110115004228.000|TR0|take on it.  Here's what Ron Reagan writes 
20110115004228.000|20110115004230.000|TR0|in the book.  "Three years in to his first 
20110115004230.000|20110115004232.000|TR0|term as president, though, I was feeling 
20110115004232.000|20110115004235.000|TR0|the first shivers of concern that 
20110115004235.000|20110115004237.000|TR0|something beyond mellowing was affecting 
20110115004237.000|20110115004240.000|TR0|my father."  That's Ron Reagan talking 
20110115004240.000|20110115004242.000|TR0|about there, by that context the early 
20110115004242.000|20110115004244.000|TR0|1980s.  Here's Nancy Reagan in an 
20110115004244.000|20110115004247.000|TR0|interview with Larry King back in 2001 
20110115004247.000|20110115004249.000|TR0|talking about, in 1994, when they learned

20110115004301.000|20110115004304.000|TR0|When did you first notify?
20110115004304.000|20110115004306.000|TR0|
20110115004306.000|20110115004308.000|TR0|NANCY REAGAN, FMR. FIRST LADY:  I didn't.
20110115004308.000|20110115004311.000|TR0|
20110115004311.000|20110115004313.000|TR0|L. KING:  You never noticed Alzheimer's?
20110115004313.000|20110115004316.000|TR0|
20110115004316.000|20110115004318.000|TR0|REAGAN:  I didn't.  No, no.  We went to 
20110115004318.000|20110115004320.000|TR0|Mayo's in August that year --
20110115004320.000|20110115004323.000|TR0|
20110115004323.000|20110115004325.000|TR0|L. KING:  Was it the normal memory 
20110115004325.000|20110115004328.000|TR0|slippages that older people have?
20110115004328.000|20110115004330.000|TR0|
20110115004330.000|20110115004332.000|TR0|REAGAN:  Well, yes.  You forget names.  I 
20110115004332.000|20110115004335.000|TR0|forget names.
20110115004335.000|20110115004337.000|TR0|
20110115004337.000|20110115004340.000|TR0|L. KING:  I forget what I had for lunch 
20110115004340.000|20110115004342.000|TR0|today.
20110115004342.000|20110115004344.000|TR0|
20110115004344.000|20110115004347.000|TR0|REAGAN:  So, no, I didn't notice anything.
20110115004347.000|20110115004349.000|TR0|
20110115004349.000|20110115004352.000|TR0|L. KING:  And what happened at Mayo?
20110115004352.000|20110115004354.000|TR0|
20110115004354.000|20110115004356.000|TR0|REAGAN:  They diagnosed it as Alzheimer's.

20110115004404.000|20110115004406.000|TR0|KING:  Nancy Reagan, who was with him more 
20110115004406.000|20110115004408.000|TR0|than anybody, says she didn't notice it in 
20110115004408.000|20110115004411.000|TR0|1994.  Ron Reagan says he was noticing 
20110115004411.000|20110115004413.000|TR0|back as early as 1983 or so.
20110115004413.000|20110115004416.000|TR0|
20110115004416.000|20110115004418.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  Ron was not around a whole lot.  
20110115004418.000|20110115004420.000|TR0|Maureen was, but Ron was not around a 
20110115004420.000|20110115004423.000|TR0|whole lot.  I went through the entire '84 
20110115004423.000|20110115004425.000|TR0|campaign, which I ran with him.  He ran a 
20110115004425.000|20110115004428.000|TR0|very vigorous campaign including the 
20110115004428.000|20110115004430.000|TR0|closing three weeks of the campaign, even 
20110115004430.000|20110115004432.000|TR0|though he was way ahead, he went through 
20110115004432.000|20110115004435.000|TR0|21, 30 states.  He was very, very vigorous 
20110115004435.000|20110115004437.000|TR0|on the campaign trail, with tons of media 
20110115004437.000|20110115004440.000|TR0|behind him.  And nobody ever said he was 
20110115004440.000|20110115004442.000|TR0|slipping at that point in time.
20110115004442.000|20110115004444.000|TR0|
20110115004444.000|20110115004447.000|TR0|As I said, we all age.  I'm not what I was 
20110115004447.000|20110115004449.000|TR0|25 years ago.  As he got closer to the end 
20110115004449.000|20110115004452.000|TR0|of his term, he slowed down a little bit, 
20110115004452.000|20110115004454.000|TR0|but obviously, he had gone through an 
20110115004454.000|20110115004456.000|TR0|awful lot in the sense of the wounds and 
20110115004456.000|20110115004459.000|TR0|stuff that I talked about.  But mentally, 
20110115004459.000|20110115004501.000|TR0|I never found him deficient.
20110115004501.000|20110115004504.000|TR0|
20110115004504.000|20110115004506.000|TR0|KING:  It was a pretty have a ordinary 
20110115004506.000|20110115004508.000|TR0|step for Nancy Reagan to authorize the 
20110115004508.000|20110115004511.000|TR0|White House  doctors to go public, to talk 
20110115004511.000|20110115004513.000|TR0|to "The New York Times" to look back 
20110115004513.000|20110115004516.000|TR0|through the records.  Were you part of 
20110115004516.000|20110115004518.000|TR0|those conversations at all? That was back 
20110115004518.000|20110115004520.000|TR0|1997.
20110115004520.000|20110115004523.000|TR0|
20110115004523.000|20110115004525.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  No, I was not.       KING:  Do 
20110115004525.000|20110115004528.000|TR0|you think she did that to defend him?
20110115004528.000|20110115004530.000|TR0|
20110115004530.000|20110115004532.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  I think once they admitted the 
20110115004532.000|20110115004535.000|TR0|Alzheimer's -- he had a hard time during 
20110115004535.000|20110115004537.000|TR0|the Iran Contra stuff.  This was the most 
20110115004537.000|20110115004540.000|TR0|inconsistent thing he'd ever done.  The 
20110115004540.000|20110115004542.000|TR0|change from Jim Baker to Don Regan, 
20110115004542.000|20110115004544.000|TR0|changed the whole dynamics of the way the 
20110115004544.000|20110115004547.000|TR0|White House worked. The first team knew 
20110115004547.000|20110115004549.000|TR0|how to functioned, new how to bring-Don 
20110115004549.000|20110115004552.000|TR0|Regan tried to be president, himself, and 
20110115004552.000|20110115004554.000|TR0|worked to the great detriment of the 
20110115004554.000|20110115004556.000|TR0|country.
20110115004556.000|20110115004559.000|TR0|
20110115004559.000|20110115004601.000|TR0|Ken Duberstein, Howard Baker, when they 
20110115004601.000|20110115004604.000|TR0|came in, they understood Reagan.  And they 
20110115004604.000|20110115004606.000|TR0|made sure that he got the kinds of 
20110115004606.000|20110115004609.000|TR0|decision packages and everything that he 
20110115004609.000|20110115004611.000|TR0|need.  But obviously 70 to 78 is a change 
20110115004611.000|20110115004613.000|TR0|in anyone's life.  You slow down a little 
20110115004613.000|20110115004616.000|TR0|bit.  And I think the hard of hearing is 
20110115004616.000|20110115004618.000|TR0|probably what affected him more than 
20110115004618.000|20110115004621.000|TR0|anything else.
20110115004621.000|20110115004623.000|TR0|
20110115004623.000|20110115004625.000|TR0|KING:  Ed Rollins appreciate your insights

20110115004659.000|20110115004701.000|TR0|KING:  Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
20110115004701.000|20110115004704.000|TR0|Napolitano pulled the plug on the 
20110115004704.000|20110115004706.000|TR0|so-called virtual fence along the U.S. 
20110115004706.000|20110115004709.000|TR0|border with Mexico. Since 2005 the 
20110115004709.000|20110115004711.000|TR0|government has spent nearly a billion 
20110115004711.000|20110115004713.000|TR0|dollars, nearly a billion dollars, of your 
20110115004713.000|20110115004716.000|TR0|money on the high-tech surveillance 
20110115004716.000|20110115004718.000|TR0|system, which was intended to cut down on 
20110115004718.000|20110115004721.000|TR0|illegal immigration.  A written statement 
20110115004721.000|20110115004723.000|TR0|from Secretary Napolitano says, quote, 
20110115004723.000|20110115004725.000|TR0|"There is no one size fits all solution to 
20110115004725.000|20110115004728.000|TR0|meet all border technology needs."

20110115004730.000|20110115004733.000|TR0|Smart decision or not?  Joining me now 
20110115004733.000|20110115004735.000|TR0|from California, Democratic Congresswoman 
20110115004735.000|20110115004737.000|TR0|Loretta Sanchez, she is a member of the 
20110115004737.000|20110115004740.000|TR0|Homeland Security Committee.  And here 
20110115004740.000|20110115004742.000|TR0|with me, National Security Contributor 
20110115004742.000|20110115004745.000|TR0|Fran Townsend, a member of the Homeland 
20110115004745.000|20110115004747.000|TR0|Security Advisory Board, and a former top 
20110115004747.000|20110115004749.000|TR0|advisor in the Bush White House.
20110115004749.000|20110115004752.000|TR0|
20110115004752.000|20110115004754.000|TR0|It was in the Bush White House that this 
20110115004754.000|20110115004757.000|TR0|money started to be spent.  People 
20110115004757.000|20110115004759.000|TR0|thought, A, build some physical fence, but 
20110115004759.000|20110115004801.000|TR0|use a virtual fence.  Is this a good 
20110115004801.000|20110115004804.000|TR0|decision to pull the plug?
20110115004804.000|20110115004806.000|TR0|
20110115004806.000|20110115004809.000|TR0|FRANCES FRAGOS TOWNSEND, HOMELAND SECURITY 
20110115004809.000|20110115004811.000|TR0|ADVISORY BOARD:  Well, John, let's 
20110115004811.000|20110115004813.000|TR0|remember the whole idea of the fence 
20110115004813.000|20110115004816.000|TR0|started when President Bush was trying to 
20110115004816.000|20110115004818.000|TR0|get comprehensive immigration reform 
20110115004818.000|20110115004821.000|TR0|passed and the negotiation with Congress 
20110115004821.000|20110115004823.000|TR0|was you have to do better on enforcement 
20110115004823.000|20110115004825.000|TR0|first.  So Congress did the bill that 
20110115004825.000|20110115004828.000|TR0|required all the 700 or more miles of 
20110115004828.000|20110115004830.000|TR0|fencing.  Well, real actual fencing the 
20110115004830.000|20110115004833.000|TR0|way we think of it was never going to work 
20110115004833.000|20110115004835.000|TR0|because of the terrain.  So that is how 
20110115004835.000|20110115004837.000|TR0|you come up with virtual fence.  They put 
20110115004837.000|20110115004840.000|TR0|that hundreds of miles both pedestrian and 
20110115004840.000|20110115004842.000|TR0|vehicle fence in, but the technology has 
20110115004842.000|20110115004845.000|TR0|been a problem.  It was a problem in the 
20110115004845.000|20110115004847.000|TR0|Bush administration and it's continued to 
20110115004847.000|20110115004849.000|TR0|be a problem in terms of its 
20110115004849.000|20110115004852.000|TR0|implementation during the Obama 
20110115004852.000|20110115004854.000|TR0|administration..
20110115004854.000|20110115004857.000|TR0|
20110115004857.000|20110115004859.000|TR0|KING:  Congresswoman, is this a smart 
20110115004859.000|20110115004901.000|TR0|idea.  There are people out there who 
20110115004901.000|20110115004904.000|TR0|will, number one, say wait a minute, what 
20110115004904.000|20110115004906.000|TR0|about illegal immigration.  If you're 
20110115004906.000|20110115004909.000|TR0|stopping this what is the plan?  If you 
20110115004909.000|20110115004911.000|TR0|are not going to use this technology, 
20110115004911.000|20110115004913.000|TR0|what's plan B?  Others will say $1 billion 
20110115004913.000|20110115004916.000|TR0|of my money and now you're telling me it 
20110115004916.000|20110115004918.000|TR0|doesn't work?
20110115004918.000|20110115004921.000|TR0|
20110115004921.000|20110115004923.000|TR0|REP. LORETTA SANCHEZ, (D) CALIFORNIA:  
20110115004923.000|20110115004925.000|TR0|Well, those 700 miles, most of it has been 
20110115004925.000|20110115004928.000|TR0|put in, but remember we have 2,500 miles 
20110115004928.000|20110115004930.000|TR0|there and we have probably one and a half 
20110115004930.000|20110115004933.000|TR0|times that amount up on our northern 
20110115004933.000|20110115004935.000|TR0|border.  And I would venture to say that 
20110115004935.000|20110115004937.000|TR0|eventually we're going to have to worry 
20110115004937.000|20110115004940.000|TR0|about both borders in the same way.
20110115004940.000|20110115004942.000|TR0|
20110115004942.000|20110115004945.000|TR0|So we were thinking-the hope was that 
20110115004945.000|20110115004947.000|TR0|because of the terrain and the difficult 
20110115004947.000|20110115004949.000|TR0|and extreme weather conditions, that in 
20110115004949.000|20110115004952.000|TR0|places where we really couldn't put some 
20110115004952.000|20110115004954.000|TR0|of these fences, that really work, and by 
20110115004954.000|20110115004957.000|TR0|the way, the Department of Homeland 
20110115004957.000|20110115004959.000|TR0|Security actually has a fence lab where 
20110115004959.000|20110115005001.000|TR0|they test all types of different fences 
20110115005001.000|20110115005004.000|TR0|there.  But we were hoping that we would 
20110115005004.000|20110115005006.000|TR0|be able to use the Technology.  The 
20110115005006.000|20110115005009.000|TR0|problem was, in the beginning, the Border 
20110115005009.000|20110115005011.000|TR0|Patrol, the people who actually would use 
20110115005011.000|20110115005013.000|TR0|this, were not actually, were prohibited 
20110115005013.000|20110115005016.000|TR0|from talking to the contractors who were 
20110115005016.000|20110115005018.000|TR0|putting this together for us.  The 
20110115005018.000|20110115005021.000|TR0|contract itself was poorly written.  When 
20110115005021.000|20110115005023.000|TR0|we looked at the technology, it was 
20110115005023.000|20110115005025.000|TR0|supposed to be off-the-shelf technology 
20110115005025.000|20110115005028.000|TR0|that would be integrated.  The integration 
20110115005028.000|20110115005030.000|TR0|was never done well.  The images were bad.
20110115005030.000|20110115005033.000|TR0|
20110115005033.000|20110115005035.000|TR0|So quite frankly, the first 28 miles, 
20110115005035.000|20110115005037.000|TR0|which was the pilot project that was 
20110115005037.000|20110115005040.000|TR0|supposed to be operational was then turned 
20110115005040.000|20110115005042.000|TR0|into a part of the next 40 miles, which 
20110115005042.000|20110115005045.000|TR0|included those 28, which of course also 
20110115005045.000|20110115005047.000|TR0|didn't work.  And ultimately, this has 
20110115005047.000|20110115005050.000|TR0|just not been a project that has worked 
20110115005050.000|20110115005052.000|TR0|very well.
20110115005052.000|20110115005054.000|TR0|
20110115005054.000|20110115005057.000|TR0|KING:  I want to go to the map in a 
20110115005057.000|20110115005059.000|TR0|minute.  And show people what this looks 
20110115005059.000|20110115005102.000|TR0|like and what we mean, but I was listening 
20110115005102.000|20110115005104.000|TR0|to your description of this good 
20110115005104.000|20110115005106.000|TR0|intention, turning into what sounded to 
20110115005106.000|20110115005109.000|TR0|me, forgive me, the $600 million toilet 
20110115005109.000|20110115005111.000|TR0|seats from the Pentagon.  This sounds like 
20110115005111.000|20110115005114.000|TR0|it was a government bureaucracy and 
20110115005114.000|20110115005116.000|TR0|contracting mess.  If that's the case, if 
20110115005116.000|20110115005118.000|TR0|it was that bad, Congresswoman, have those 
20110115005118.000|20110115005121.000|TR0|problems been corrected before we move on 
20110115005121.000|20110115005123.000|TR0|to plan B?
20110115005123.000|20110115005126.000|TR0|
20110115005126.000|20110115005128.000|TR0|SANCHEZ:  Well, some have.  Remember that 
20110115005128.000|20110115005130.000|TR0|when the Homeland Department was made, 
20110115005130.000|20110115005133.000|TR0|there were 22 different pieces that were 
20110115005133.000|20110115005135.000|TR0|put together in one department.  But no 
20110115005135.000|20110115005138.000|TR0|more money was given even though that was 
20110115005138.000|20110115005140.000|TR0|set up.  And so you, they didn't have 
20110115005140.000|20110115005142.000|TR0|contractors, they, they didn't have 
20110115005142.000|20110115005145.000|TR0|general administrative type of people, so 
20110115005145.000|20110115005147.000|TR0|they relied on other departments to sort 
20110115005147.000|20110115005150.000|TR0|of borrow people to do that type of thing. 
20110115005150.000|20110115005152.000|TR0|Or in -- what were some of the cases, I 
20110115005152.000|20110115005154.000|TR0|saw -- not this one, we actually, the 
20110115005154.000|20110115005157.000|TR0|department actually had the contractor be 
20110115005157.000|20110115005159.000|TR0|the one making the contract and overseeing 
20110115005159.000|20110115005202.000|TR0|the contract for the actual government 
20110115005202.000|20110115005204.000|TR0|department.
20110115005204.000|20110115005206.000|TR0|
20110115005206.000|20110115005209.000|TR0|KING:  Hang on one second.  Let me stop 
20110115005209.000|20110115005211.000|TR0|you for one second.  I want to bring Fran 
20110115005211.000|20110115005214.000|TR0|into the conversation, because you were in 
20110115005214.000|20110115005216.000|TR0|the White House at this time.       
20110115005216.000|20110115005218.000|TR0|TOWNSEND:  Yes.
20110115005218.000|20110115005221.000|TR0|
20110115005221.000|20110115005223.000|TR0|KING:  Is it that bad?  Was it, is it 
20110115005223.000|20110115005226.000|TR0|essentially, here, contractor we need you 
20110115005226.000|20110115005228.000|TR0|to do this.  Go do it.  Don't have any 
20110115005228.000|20110115005230.000|TR0|oversight, the Border Patrol, as the 
20110115005230.000|20110115005233.000|TR0|congresswoman says, can't talk to the 
20110115005233.000|20110115005235.000|TR0|contractor, that sounds asinine.
20110115005235.000|20110115005238.000|TR0|
20110115005238.000|20110115005240.000|TR0|TOWNSEND:  Secretary Chertoff, when he at 
20110115005240.000|20110115005242.000|TR0|the department was very frustrated by 
20110115005242.000|20110115005245.000|TR0|that.  And set up a contracting oversight 
20110115005245.000|20110115005247.000|TR0|office.  A program office to oversee the 
20110115005247.000|20110115005250.000|TR0|contractor, to set milestones, and measure 
20110115005250.000|20110115005252.000|TR0|against that.  It became apparent, then, 
20110115005252.000|20110115005254.000|TR0|as we begin to walk through the process 
20110115005254.000|20110115005257.000|TR0|with milestones that it wasn't working 
20110115005257.000|20110115005259.000|TR0|very well, the contractor, Boeing, at the 
20110115005259.000|20110115005302.000|TR0|time, was called out publicly both by 
20110115005302.000|20110115005304.000|TR0|Congress and the press about it.  So, the 
20110115005304.000|20110115005306.000|TR0|additional oversight really did highlight 
20110115005306.000|20110115005309.000|TR0|what the problems were.  Off the shelf 
20110115005309.000|20110115005311.000|TR0|technology had very difficult time working 
20110115005311.000|20110115005314.000|TR0|in the conditions on the Southwest border 
20110115005314.000|20110115005316.000|TR0|in the heat and sand.
20110115005316.000|20110115005318.000|TR0|
20110115005318.000|20110115005321.000|TR0|KING:  Let's take a closer look.  You talk 
20110115005321.000|20110115005323.000|TR0|about off the shelf technology.  You talk 
20110115005323.000|20110115005326.000|TR0|about eventually having some contract 
20110115005326.000|20110115005328.000|TR0|oversight. Let's look at what we're 
20110115005328.000|20110115005330.000|TR0|talking about here.  This is obviously the 
20110115005330.000|20110115005333.000|TR0|border, you see California, all the way 
20110115005333.000|20110115005335.000|TR0|over through Texas.  You look at the lines 
20110115005335.000|20110115005338.000|TR0|right here.  If it is this green, this is 
20110115005338.000|20110115005340.000|TR0|an actual physical fence, a completed 
20110115005340.000|20110115005342.000|TR0|fence.  Yellow line is fence under 
20110115005342.000|20110115005345.000|TR0|construction.  Red is fence planned.  The 
20110115005345.000|20110115005347.000|TR0|virtual fence, was really- the main 
20110115005347.000|20110115005350.000|TR0|virtual fence activity was down here in 
20110115005350.000|20110115005352.000|TR0|Arizona.
20110115005352.000|20110115005354.000|TR0|
20110115005354.000|20110115005357.000|TR0|As you look through, I just want to touch 
20110115005357.000|20110115005359.000|TR0|here.  We will show you some of the 
20110115005359.000|20110115005402.000|TR0|technology here.  Some of these are 
20110115005402.000|20110115005404.000|TR0|sensors, and cameras, they are designed to 
20110115005404.000|20110115005406.000|TR0|pick up movement.  Some of the cameras 
20110115005406.000|20110115005409.000|TR0|take better pictures at night.  These are 
20110115005409.000|20110115005411.000|TR0|relayed back to control stations. I 
20110115005411.000|20110115005414.000|TR0|visited one, a few years back, essentially 
20110115005414.000|20110115005416.000|TR0|it s like a police station.  They sit at 
20110115005416.000|20110115005418.000|TR0|the desk, they are monitoring all these 
20110115005418.000|20110115005421.000|TR0|feeds coming in.
20110115005421.000|20110115005423.000|TR0|
20110115005423.000|20110115005426.000|TR0|Here, here is what we get.  This cost, 
20110115005426.000|20110115005428.000|TR0|again, nearly $1 billion of your money.  
20110115005428.000|20110115005430.000|TR0|It was supposed to cover 53 miles, using 
20110115005430.000|20110115005433.000|TR0|sensor towers, night cameras, ground 
20110115005433.000|20110115005435.000|TR0|sensors, this is supposed to be the 
20110115005435.000|20110115005438.000|TR0|technology that helped.  This is what the 
20110115005438.000|20110115005440.000|TR0|government says it will do now, and it 
20110115005440.000|20110115005442.000|TR0|says it will cost a lot less, but still 
20110115005442.000|20110115005445.000|TR0|$750 million, to cover a 300-mile area 
20110115005445.000|20110115005447.000|TR0|bigger, using more drones, unmanned 
20110115005447.000|20110115005450.000|TR0|aircraft. They have used that in the 
20110115005450.000|20110115005452.000|TR0|military quite a bit.  More thermal 
20110115005452.000|20110115005454.000|TR0|imagery, more video surveillance, 
20110115005454.000|20110115005457.000|TR0|obviously there is, largely because of our 
20110115005457.000|20110115005459.000|TR0|military efforts overseas, more advanced 
20110115005459.000|20110115005502.000|TR0|technology now.
20110115005502.000|20110115005504.000|TR0|
20110115005504.000|20110115005506.000|TR0|But first to you, Fran, then the 
20110115005506.000|20110115005509.000|TR0|congresswoman.  A, is it more effective?  
20110115005509.000|20110115005511.000|TR0|B., is there better coordination.  Meaning 
20110115005511.000|20110115005514.000|TR0|the contractors who run the technology do 
20110115005514.000|20110115005516.000|TR0|they actually talk to the guy in the green 
20110115005516.000|20110115005519.000|TR0|uniform on the ground?  Is the money being 
20110115005519.000|20110115005521.000|TR0|well spent?
20110115005521.000|20110115005523.000|TR0|
20110115005523.000|20110115005526.000|TR0|TOWNSEND: That is, the issue, John, is why 
20110115005526.000|20110115005528.000|TR0|is it now that unmanned aircraft and 
20110115005528.000|20110115005531.000|TR0|thermal imaging, all of a sudden are going 
20110115005531.000|20110115005533.000|TR0|to be the answer.  Why haven't those been 
20110115005533.000|20110115005535.000|TR0|used right along.  What is our experience 
20110115005535.000|20110115005538.000|TR0|with the deployment of those?  We need to 
20110115005538.000|20110115005540.000|TR0|have test, pilot projects that demonstrate 
20110115005540.000|20110115005543.000|TR0|the efficacy of those.  Just as you say 
20110115005543.000|20110115005545.000|TR0|they're tied into the operators and that 
20110115005545.000|20110115005547.000|TR0|the operators, the people who have to 
20110115005547.000|20110115005550.000|TR0|enforce our immigration laws, are the ones 
20110115005550.000|20110115005552.000|TR0|passing on whether or not those are the 
20110115005552.000|20110115005555.000|TR0|right technologies.

20110115005557.000|20110115005559.000|TR0|KING:  We'll continue this conversation.  
20110115005559.000|20110115005602.000|TR0|Congresswoman Sanchez, unfortunately we 
20110115005602.000|20110115005604.000|TR0|are out of time tonight.  We'll continue 
20110115005604.000|20110115005607.000|TR0|this conversation, because I think anybody 
20110115005607.000|20110115005609.000|TR0|watching at home is worried, A, what did 
20110115005609.000|20110115005611.000|TR0|you do with the money?  And, B, is the new 
20110115005611.000|20110115005614.000|TR0|plan, you going to waste more money, or 
20110115005614.000|20110115005616.000|TR0|are you going to actually protect the 
20110115005616.000|20110115005619.000|TR0|border?
20110115005619.000|20110115005621.000|TR0|
20110115005621.000|20110115005623.000|TR0|Congresswoman, appreciate your time.  
20110115005623.000|20110115005626.000|TR0|We'll continue our coverage here.  Fran,

20110115005631.000|20110115005633.000|TR0|When we come back, you'll smile a little 
20110115005633.000|20110115005635.000|TR0|built.  It's been a tough week.  We'll 
20110115005635.000|20110115005638.000|TR0|smile a little bit.  Are you ready for 
20110115005638.000|20110115005640.000|TR0|some football?  Pete On The Street sure 
20110115005640.000|20110115005643.000|TR0|is.  You're going to lose, Pete.

20110115005650.000|20110115005652.000|TR0|KING:  If you have been here once or 
20110115005652.000|20110115005655.000|TR0|twice, you know I like sports and you know 
20110115005655.000|20110115005657.000|TR0|I'm a Boston guy, so I'm a New England 
20110115005657.000|20110115005659.000|TR0|Patriots fan.  If you watched this guy 
20110115005659.000|20110115005702.000|TR0|Pete Dominick, our offbeat reporter in New 
20110115005702.000|20110115005704.000|TR0|York he is a little lost, he roots for the 
20110115005704.000|20110115005707.000|TR0|team called the Yankees, and those guys 
20110115005707.000|20110115005709.000|TR0|there called the Jets.
20110115005709.000|20110115005711.000|TR0|
20110115005711.000|20110115005714.000|TR0|Pete, you know, the last time we went 
20110115005714.000|20110115005716.000|TR0|through this.  You wore that shirt.  You 
20110115005716.000|20110115005719.000|TR0|said the Jets were going to win.  It was a 
20110115005719.000|20110115005721.000|TR0|humiliatingly great win for the Patriots.  
20110115005721.000|20110115005723.000|TR0|And you brought me the Macabeets (ph) on 
20110115005723.000|20110115005726.000|TR0|Monday.  What are you going to do for me 
20110115005726.000|20110115005728.000|TR0|this Monday?
20110115005728.000|20110115005731.000|TR0|
20110115005731.000|20110115005733.000|TR0|PETER DOMINICK, OFFBEAT REPORTER:  I don't 
20110115005733.000|20110115005735.000|TR0|need to do anything this Monday, John 
20110115005735.000|20110115005738.000|TR0|King.  Because on Sunday, I, Pete 
20110115005738.000|20110115005740.000|TR0|Dominick, guarantee a New York Jets' 
20110115005740.000|20110115005743.000|TR0|victory against the Patriots.
20110115005743.000|20110115005745.000|TR0|

20110115005750.000|20110115005752.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  The classiest paper in New 
20110115005752.000|20110115005755.000|TR0|York, "The New York Post" cover, they just 
20110115005755.000|20110115005757.000|TR0|make your coach look like Darth Vader.  
20110115005757.000|20110115005759.000|TR0|But who is this the, the "Boston Metro"?  
20110115005759.000|20110115005802.000|TR0|This is just wrong.  The whole feet fetish 
20110115005802.000|20110115005804.000|TR0|thing.  And even, Condoleezza Rice, the 
20110115005804.000|20110115005807.000|TR0|former secretary of State is getting in on 
20110115005807.000|20110115005809.000|TR0|the action on CNN's newest star, Piers

20110115005819.000|20110115005821.000|TR0|CONDOLEEZZA RICE, FMR. SECRETARY OF STATE: 
20110115005821.000|20110115005823.000|TR0| Well, the good money at this point would 
20110115005823.000|20110115005826.000|TR0|have to say the New England Patriots, 
20110115005826.000|20110115005828.000|TR0|because they're so dominant.  But I am 
20110115005828.000|20110115005831.000|TR0|going to say Atlanta Falcons.

20110115005838.000|20110115005840.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Well, unfortunately, even 
20110115005840.000|20110115005843.000|TR0|Condoleezza Rice is wrong on both counts.  
20110115005843.000|20110115005845.000|TR0|Because it is going to be the big Jets, 
20110115005845.000|20110115005847.000|TR0|big win, on Sunday, John King.  I will be 
20110115005847.000|20110115005850.000|TR0|Tweeting throughout the game, your Twitter

20110115005857.000|20110115005859.000|TR0|KING:  I will be talking right back at 
20110115005859.000|20110115005902.000|TR0|you, my friend.  I think my guys will win, 
20110115005902.000|20110115005904.000|TR0|I hope it is a great game.  I don't even 
20110115005904.000|20110115005907.000|TR0|mind if it is a little close.  I'll see 
20110115005907.000|20110115005909.000|TR0|you on Monday. And I hope to be smiling. 
20110115005909.000|20110115005911.000|TR0|Pete, have a great weekend.  Enjoy the 
20110115005911.000|20110115005914.000|TR0|game.

20110115005916.000|20110115005919.000|TR0|Before we go for the weekend, I want to 
20110115005919.000|20110115005921.000|TR0|say thank you after a tough week.  And 
20110115005921.000|20110115005923.000|TR0|thanks especially to the people of Tucson. 
20110115005923.000|20110115005926.000|TR0| We were there for several days, they were 
20110115005926.000|20110115005928.000|TR0|angry, they were sad, they were hurt.  
20110115005928.000|20110115005931.000|TR0|They were gracious and friendly to us 
20110115005931.000|20110115005933.000|TR0|throughout.  What sticks with me mostly 
20110115005933.000|20110115005935.000|TR0|was so many young children at the 
20110115005935.000|20110115005938.000|TR0|makeshift vigils all across town.  We 
20110115005938.000|20110115005940.000|TR0|should pray for them, as we enjoy our 
20110115005940.000|20110115005943.000|TR0|weekend. That's all for us tonight.
