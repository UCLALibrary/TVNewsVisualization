20110111141520.536|20110111141522.396|TR0|ongoing risk of brain swelling. 
20110111141522.396|20110111141524.257|TR0|This is Michael Lemole, chief 
20110111141524.257|20110111141526.118|TR0|neurosurgeon at the University

20110111141531.699|20110111141533.560|TR0|>> DR. MICHAEL LEMOLE: With 
20110111141533.560|20110111141535.421|TR0|regard to Congresswoman 
20110111141535.421|20110111141537.281|TR0|Giffords' recovery, at this 
20110111141537.281|20110111141539.142|TR0|phase in the game, no change is 
20110111141539.142|20110111141541.002|TR0|good. And we have no change. 
20110111141541.002|20110111141542.863|TR0|That is to say, she's still 
20110111141542.863|20110111141544.724|TR0|following those basic commands. 
20110111141544.724|20110111141546.584|TR0|On top of that, the CAT scans 
20110111141546.584|20110111141548.445|TR0|are showing that there is no 
20110111141548.445|20110111141550.306|TR0|progression of that swelling. 
20110111141550.306|20110111141552.166|TR0|We're not out of the woods yet. 
20110111141552.166|20110111141554.027|TR0|That swelling can sometimes take 
20110111141554.027|20110111141555.887|TR0|three days or five days to 
20110111141555.887|20110111141557.748|TR0|maximize. But every day that 
20110111141557.748|20110111141559.609|TR0|goes by and we don't see an 
20110111141559.609|20110111141601.469|TR0|increase, we're slightly more 
20110111141601.469|20110111141603.330|TR0|optimistic. And so, with that in 
20110111141603.330|20110111141605.190|TR0|mind, I think we are going to 
20110111141605.190|20110111141607.051|TR0|proceed over the next few days 
20110111141607.051|20110111141608.912|TR0|to see how she does.

20110111141647.984|20110111141649.845|TR0|Green, said his daughter had 
20110111141649.845|20110111141651.706|TR0|attended Giffords' event out of 
20110111141651.706|20110111141653.566|TR0|an interest in politics. He also 
20110111141653.566|20110111141655.427|TR0|reflected on her birth date,

20110111141702.869|20110111141704.730|TR0|started getting interested in 
20110111141704.730|20110111141706.591|TR0|politics. And at least to have 
20110111141706.591|20110111141708.451|TR0|him mention of her makes me feel 
20110111141708.451|20110111141710.312|TR0|good. She began her life on a 
20110111141710.312|20110111141712.172|TR0|tragedy like 9/11, and her life 
20110111141712.172|20110111141714.033|TR0|was ended with a tragedy here in

20110111141817.294|20110111141819.154|TR0|wonderful, incredibly brave 
20110111141819.154|20110111141821.015|TR0|young woman Congress member,

20110111141826.597|20110111141828.458|TR0|of problems. So, rather than 
20110111141828.458|20110111141830.318|TR0|standing off from each other, we 
20110111141830.318|20110111141832.179|TR0|should work to try to prevent

20110111141839.621|20110111141841.482|TR0|actions that would shut down a

20110111142016.373|20110111142018.234|TR0|him?
20110111142018.234|20110111142020.094|TR0|
20110111142020.094|20110111142021.955|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: Well, when I 
20110111142021.955|20110111142023.815|TR0|first got into the class, I 
20110111142023.815|20110111142025.676|TR0|could tell that he was 
20110111142025.676|20110111142027.537|TR0|definitely off. He just didn't 
20110111142027.537|20110111142029.397|TR0|have the same stability that was 
20110111142029.397|20110111142031.258|TR0|apparent in most people. And he 
20110111142031.258|20110111142033.119|TR0|was definitely an outsider in 
20110111142033.119|20110111142034.979|TR0|the class. And I grew up in a 
20110111142034.979|20110111142036.840|TR0|small rural town, and I - so I 
20110111142036.840|20110111142038.700|TR0|knew what it was like to be 
20110111142038.700|20110111142040.561|TR0|isolated and ostracized, and I 
20110111142040.561|20110111142042.422|TR0|didn't want him to have to 
20110111142042.422|20110111142044.282|TR0|experience that in a poetry 
20110111142044.282|20110111142046.143|TR0|class, so I started, you know, 
20110111142046.143|20110111142048.003|TR0|trying to talk to him in class. 
20110111142048.003|20110111142049.864|TR0|I'd give him high-fives when I'd 
20110111142049.864|20110111142051.725|TR0|walk in and just tried to be 
20110111142051.725|20110111142053.585|TR0|friendly with him, because 
20110111142053.585|20110111142055.446|TR0|everyone else seemed so off-put 
20110111142055.446|20110111142057.306|TR0|by his presence.
20110111142057.306|20110111142059.167|TR0|
20110111142059.167|20110111142101.028|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And so, what did 
20110111142101.028|20110111142102.888|TR0|you say to him? How did he 
20110111142102.888|20110111142104.749|TR0|respond to you?
20110111142104.749|20110111142106.610|TR0|
20110111142106.610|20110111142108.470|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: He really 
20110111142108.470|20110111142110.331|TR0|seemed to appreciate the 
20110111142110.331|20110111142112.191|TR0|interaction with me. When I'd 
20110111142112.191|20110111142114.052|TR0|give him high-fives, he'd smile 
20110111142114.052|20110111142115.913|TR0|really big, and he'd nod, and 
20110111142115.913|20110111142117.773|TR0|he'd say, "What's up?" We'd talk 
20110111142117.773|20110111142119.634|TR0|about writing. He was really 
20110111142119.634|20110111142121.494|TR0|into older philosophy like Greek 
20110111142121.494|20110111142123.355|TR0|philosophy, and so he'd try to 
20110111142123.355|20110111142125.216|TR0|engage me in philosophical 
20110111142125.216|20110111142127.076|TR0|debate.
20110111142127.076|20110111142128.937|TR0|
20110111142128.937|20110111142130.797|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk 
20110111142130.797|20110111142132.658|TR0|about the poetry, his response 
20110111142132.658|20110111142134.519|TR0|in the class, his own poetry, 
20110111142134.519|20110111142136.379|TR0|his response to others' poems?
20110111142136.379|20110111142138.240|TR0|
20110111142138.240|20110111142140.101|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: His poems were 
20110111142140.101|20110111142141.961|TR0|actually pretty, pretty 
20110111142141.961|20110111142143.822|TR0|different from what he seems to 
20110111142143.822|20110111142145.682|TR0|have become. One of his poems 
20110111142145.682|20110111142147.543|TR0|was about a garden and a 
20110111142147.543|20110111142149.404|TR0|gardener and the relationship 
20110111142149.404|20110111142151.264|TR0|between the gardener and the 
20110111142151.264|20110111142153.125|TR0|earth and the beauty of the 
20110111142153.125|20110111142154.985|TR0|earth and the flower. One of his 
20110111142154.985|20110111142156.846|TR0|other poems called "Meathead" 
20110111142156.846|20110111142158.707|TR0|was a satire piece about jocks 
20110111142158.707|20110111142200.567|TR0|and how they spend all their 
20110111142200.567|20110111142202.428|TR0|time at the gym and then how the 
20110111142202.428|20110111142204.289|TR0|gym equipment is the equivalent 
20110111142204.289|20110111142206.149|TR0|to their girlfriends.
20110111142206.149|20110111142208.010|TR0|
20110111142208.010|20110111142209.870|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And what about 
20110111142209.870|20110111142211.731|TR0|his response to other students 
20110111142211.731|20110111142213.592|TR0|in the class?
20110111142213.592|20110111142215.452|TR0|
20110111142215.452|20110111142217.313|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: It varied. 
20110111142217.313|20110111142219.173|TR0|Sometimes he would be mute for a 
20110111142219.173|20110111142221.034|TR0|critique session. Other times he 
20110111142221.034|20110111142222.895|TR0|would seem to just laugh 
20110111142222.895|20110111142224.755|TR0|randomly while they were reading 
20110111142224.755|20110111142226.616|TR0|their poems, even if it was at 
20110111142226.616|20110111142228.476|TR0|an inappropriate time.
20110111142228.476|20110111142230.337|TR0|
20110111142230.337|20110111142232.198|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Was there a 
20110111142232.198|20110111142234.058|TR0|situation where a young woman in 
20110111142234.058|20110111142235.919|TR0|the class wrote a poem about an 
20110111142235.919|20110111142237.780|TR0|abortion?
20110111142237.780|20110111142239.640|TR0|
20110111142239.640|20110111142241.501|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: Yes, yes. There 
20110111142241.501|20110111142243.361|TR0|was a student that had written a 
20110111142243.361|20110111142245.222|TR0|poem about an abortion. And I 
20110111142245.222|20110111142247.083|TR0|was absent that day, but from 
20110111142247.083|20110111142248.943|TR0|what I had heard from the other 
20110111142248.943|20110111142250.804|TR0|students is he, when - after she 
20110111142250.804|20110111142252.664|TR0|had read it, he made a pretty 
20110111142252.664|20110111142254.525|TR0|distasteful joke comparing her 
20110111142254.525|20110111142256.386|TR0|to a terrorist, saying that she 
20110111142256.386|20110111142258.246|TR0|killed babies.
20110111142258.246|20110111142300.107|TR0|
20110111142300.107|20110111142301.967|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And what 
20110111142301.967|20110111142303.828|TR0|happened after saying something 
20110111142303.828|20110111142305.689|TR0|like that?
20110111142305.689|20110111142307.549|TR0|
20110111142307.549|20110111142309.410|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: She was pretty 
20110111142309.410|20110111142311.271|TR0|upset about it. And a couple 
20110111142311.271|20110111142313.131|TR0|weeks later, some of the other 
20110111142313.131|20110111142314.992|TR0|students that were uncomfortable 
20110111142314.992|20110111142316.852|TR0|with him being in the class got 
20110111142316.852|20110111142318.713|TR0|together and talked to the 
20110111142318.713|20110111142320.574|TR0|professor and asked that Jared 
20110111142320.574|20110111142322.434|TR0|be removed from class, because 
20110111142322.434|20110111142324.295|TR0|they didn't feel safe with him 
20110111142324.295|20110111142326.155|TR0|being in there.
20110111142326.155|20110111142328.016|TR0|
20110111142328.016|20110111142329.877|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And what 
20110111142329.877|20110111142331.737|TR0|happened? Was he removed?
20110111142331.737|20110111142333.598|TR0|
20110111142333.598|20110111142335.459|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: Yes, he was.
20110111142335.459|20110111142337.319|TR0|
20110111142337.319|20110111142339.180|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Ultimately, he 
20110111142339.180|20110111142341.040|TR0|was removed from the college, is 
20110111142341.040|20110111142342.901|TR0|that right? From Pima Community 
20110111142342.901|20110111142344.762|TR0|College, he was kicked out, 
20110111142344.762|20110111142346.622|TR0|unless he could bring in -
20110111142346.622|20110111142348.483|TR0|

20110111142407.089|20110111142408.950|TR0|what I was told, I had - I was 
20110111142408.950|20110111142410.810|TR0|in class with him in the spring 
20110111142410.810|20110111142412.671|TR0|semester, and in the fall 
20110111142412.671|20110111142414.531|TR0|semester, Pima had asked that he 
20110111142414.531|20110111142416.392|TR0|not come back until he had a 
20110111142416.392|20110111142418.253|TR0|psychological evaluation saying 
20110111142418.253|20110111142420.113|TR0|that he was not a threat to

20110111142425.695|20110111142427.556|TR0|thoughts on Saturday when you 
20110111142427.556|20110111142429.416|TR0|heard about the shooting? Where 
20110111142429.416|20110111142431.277|TR0|were you? And where were you 
20110111142431.277|20110111142433.137|TR0|when you heard that it was Jared 
20110111142433.137|20110111142434.998|TR0|Lee Loughner?
20110111142434.998|20110111142436.859|TR0|
20110111142436.859|20110111142438.719|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: Well, I was at 
20110111142438.719|20110111142440.580|TR0|my house, and one of the other 
20110111142440.580|20110111142442.441|TR0|students had asked me if the kid 
20110111142442.441|20110111142444.301|TR0|with the creepy grin from class, 
20110111142444.301|20110111142446.162|TR0|if his name was Jared. And I 
20110111142446.162|20110111142448.022|TR0|said yes. And she said that she 
20110111142448.022|20110111142449.883|TR0|was pretty sure that he was the 
20110111142449.883|20110111142451.744|TR0|person that shot Giffords. And 
20110111142451.744|20110111142453.604|TR0|it was definitely shocking, not 
20110111142453.604|20110111142455.465|TR0|so much because it was him, but 
20110111142455.465|20110111142457.325|TR0|just that it had happened. After 
20110111142457.325|20110111142459.186|TR0|I had time to think about it 
20110111142459.186|20110111142501.047|TR0|more and I looked back in 
20110111142501.047|20110111142502.907|TR0|hindsight, it wasn't really all 
20110111142502.907|20110111142504.768|TR0|that surprising that he was the 
20110111142504.768|20110111142506.628|TR0|person behind it.
20110111142506.628|20110111142508.489|TR0|

20110111142517.792|20110111142519.653|TR0|>> STEVEN CATES: Once, when I 
20110111142519.653|20110111142521.513|TR0|had seen him outside of class 
20110111142521.513|20110111142523.374|TR0|sitting at a picnic table on 
20110111142523.374|20110111142525.235|TR0|campus, I had ended up talking 
20110111142525.235|20110111142527.095|TR0|to him, and he was talking about 
20110111142527.095|20110111142528.956|TR0|how he was upset that the U.S. 
20110111142528.956|20110111142530.816|TR0|government had made the U.S. 
20110111142530.816|20110111142532.677|TR0|dollar virtually useless by 
20110111142532.677|20110111142534.538|TR0|doing away with the gold 
20110111142534.538|20110111142536.398|TR0|standard, and he had a desire 
20110111142536.398|20110111142538.259|TR0|for a new currency that actually 
20110111142538.259|20110111142540.120|TR0|had value. But other than that, 
20110111142540.120|20110111142541.980|TR0|he was pretty disinterested in 
20110111142541.980|20110111142543.841|TR0|politics, especially with 
20110111142543.841|20110111142545.701|TR0|current affair politics. I had 
20110111142545.701|20110111142547.562|TR0|even at one point tried to goad 
20110111142547.562|20110111142549.423|TR0|him into a political debate, and 
20110111142549.423|20110111142551.283|TR0|he was just not interested in 
20110111142551.283|20110111142553.144|TR0|talking about politics or 
20110111142553.144|20110111142555.004|TR0|current politicians.

20110111142608.029|20110111142609.889|TR0|he never - you know, other than 
20110111142609.889|20110111142611.750|TR0|the distasteful joke, he never 
20110111142611.750|20110111142613.611|TR0|threatened anybody. He never 
20110111142613.611|20110111142615.471|TR0|made any aggressive acts toward 
20110111142615.471|20110111142617.332|TR0|anyone. He didn't bully anyone.

20110111142729.896|20110111142731.756|TR0|a severely disturbed 22-year-old

20110111143009.908|20110111143011.769|TR0|>> H. CLARKE ROMANS: Well, I 
20110111143011.769|20110111143013.629|TR0|think that the legislature has 
20110111143013.629|20110111143015.490|TR0|taken a simplistic approach to 
20110111143015.490|20110111143017.351|TR0|solving the budget crisis, with 
20110111143017.351|20110111143019.211|TR0|respect to mental health 
20110111143019.211|20110111143021.072|TR0|services, at least. What we're 
20110111143021.072|20110111143022.933|TR0|finding in the community is that 
20110111143022.933|20110111143024.793|TR0|the costs were not really 
20110111143024.793|20110111143026.654|TR0|eliminated; they were just 
20110111143026.654|20110111143028.514|TR0|pushed down to less visible 
20110111143028.514|20110111143030.375|TR0|areas in the community, and 
20110111143030.375|20110111143032.236|TR0|we're responding to the 
20110111143032.236|20110111143034.096|TR0|difficulties with the most 
20110111143034.096|20110111143035.957|TR0|expensive form of services that 
20110111143035.957|20110111143037.817|TR0|the community has to offer to 
20110111143037.817|20110111143039.678|TR0|people. That's emergency rooms, 
20110111143039.678|20110111143041.539|TR0|hospitalization, law enforcement 
20110111143041.539|20110111143043.399|TR0|intervention. So, the 
20110111143043.399|20110111143045.260|TR0|communities are spending the 
20110111143045.260|20110111143047.120|TR0|money, even though it appears 
20110111143047.120|20110111143048.981|TR0|that the lawmakers believe that 
20110111143048.981|20110111143050.842|TR0|they have actually cut the 
20110111143050.842|20110111143052.702|TR0|budget and saved money. It's 
20110111143052.702|20110111143054.563|TR0|just coming out of a different 
20110111143054.563|20110111143056.424|TR0|pocket down at the community 
20110111143056.424|20110111143058.284|TR0|level. And I think that we need 
20110111143058.284|20110111143100.145|TR0|to acknowledge that it 
20110111143100.145|20110111143102.005|TR0|ultimately is less expensive in 
20110111143102.005|20110111143103.866|TR0|the community to offer necessary 
20110111143103.866|20110111143105.727|TR0|services. And this is all 
20110111143105.727|20110111143107.587|TR0|without respect to the 
20110111143107.587|20110111143109.448|TR0|devastating impact this has had 
20110111143109.448|20110111143111.308|TR0|on people's lives.

20110111143113.169|20110111143115.030|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What had been 
20110111143115.030|20110111143116.890|TR0|the effect of the budget cuts, 
20110111143116.890|20110111143118.751|TR0|specifically?
20110111143118.751|20110111143120.612|TR0|
20110111143120.612|20110111143122.472|TR0|>> H. CLARKE ROMANS: Well, I can 
20110111143122.472|20110111143124.333|TR0|give a number of examples, but 
20110111143124.333|20110111143126.193|TR0|in particular, people who have a 
20110111143126.193|20110111143128.054|TR0|serious mental illness diagnosis 
20110111143128.054|20110111143129.915|TR0|beginning last July were denied 
20110111143129.915|20110111143131.775|TR0|any further coverage in a number 
20110111143131.775|20110111143133.636|TR0|of areas - case management, 
20110111143133.636|20110111143135.496|TR0|brand-name medications, access 
20110111143135.496|20110111143137.357|TR0|to support groups, 
20110111143137.357|20110111143139.218|TR0|transportation subsidies, and 
20110111143139.218|20110111143141.078|TR0|more recently, housing 
20110111143141.078|20110111143142.939|TR0|subsidies. So these individuals 
20110111143142.939|20110111143144.799|TR0|who have the most serious forms 
20110111143144.799|20110111143146.660|TR0|of mental illness were 
20110111143146.660|20110111143148.521|TR0|essentially, except for generic 
20110111143148.521|20110111143150.381|TR0|medications, were basically 
20110111143150.381|20110111143152.242|TR0|pushed out of the system. And 
20110111143152.242|20110111143154.103|TR0|these are individuals who have a 
20110111143154.103|20110111143155.963|TR0|serious illness, who, in many 
20110111143155.963|20110111143157.824|TR0|cases, were managing with a 
20110111143157.824|20110111143159.684|TR0|support network, are now being 
20110111143159.684|20110111143201.545|TR0|pushed to the point where they 
20110111143201.545|20110111143203.406|TR0|can't manage. So they're 
20110111143203.406|20110111143205.266|TR0|decompensating. There's suicide 
20110111143205.266|20110111143207.127|TR0|attempts. There's one woman that 
20110111143207.127|20110111143208.987|TR0|we know that's very ill, but 
20110111143208.987|20110111143210.848|TR0|she's been managing OK. She's 
20110111143210.848|20110111143212.709|TR0|now been hospitalized for 36 
20110111143212.709|20110111143214.569|TR0|days over the last six months.
20110111143214.569|20110111143216.430|TR0|
20110111143216.430|20110111143218.290|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: These budget 
20110111143218.290|20110111143220.151|TR0|cuts under Jan Brewer - she, in 
20110111143220.151|20110111143222.012|TR0|particular, the Governor, must 
20110111143222.012|20110111143223.872|TR0|understand, with her son Ronald 
20110111143223.872|20110111143225.733|TR0|in a state mental facility for, 
20110111143225.733|20110111143227.594|TR0|what, 20 years after being 
20110111143227.594|20110111143229.454|TR0|convicted of sexually assaulting 
20110111143229.454|20110111143231.315|TR0|a woman, but was by reason of 
20110111143231.315|20110111143233.175|TR0|insanity, was the ultimate 
20110111143233.175|20110111143235.036|TR0|verdict. So she knows and was a 
20110111143235.036|20110111143236.897|TR0|mental health activist herself, 
20110111143236.897|20110111143238.757|TR0|the Governor.
20110111143238.757|20110111143240.618|TR0|
20110111143240.618|20110111143242.478|TR0|>> H. CLARKE ROMANS: Yes, she 
20110111143242.478|20110111143244.339|TR0|was. And frankly, to my surprise 
20110111143244.339|20110111143246.200|TR0|and many other of my colleagues, 
20110111143246.200|20110111143248.060|TR0|I don't think she put up a 
20110111143248.060|20110111143249.921|TR0|strong enough battle to, you 
20110111143249.921|20110111143251.781|TR0|know, at least protect or 
20110111143251.781|20110111143253.642|TR0|minimize the effect on mental 
20110111143253.642|20110111143255.503|TR0|health services. I think she 
20110111143255.503|20110111143257.363|TR0|succumbed to the - kind of the 
20110111143257.363|20110111143259.224|TR0|ideologues who were pushing a 
20110111143259.224|20110111143301.085|TR0|different agenda. And she did 
20110111143301.085|20110111143302.945|TR0|make some statements that she 
20110111143302.945|20110111143304.806|TR0|wanted to protect mental health 
20110111143304.806|20110111143306.666|TR0|services, but ultimately I think 
20110111143306.666|20110111143308.527|TR0|she succumbed to the other 
20110111143308.527|20110111143310.388|TR0|political pressures.
20110111143310.388|20110111143312.248|TR0|
20110111143312.248|20110111143314.109|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What about your 
20110111143314.109|20110111143315.969|TR0|own story, H. Clarke Romans, how 
20110111143315.969|20110111143317.830|TR0|you got involved with the 
20110111143317.830|20110111143319.691|TR0|Alliance on Mental Illness?
20110111143319.691|20110111143321.551|TR0|
20110111143321.551|20110111143323.412|TR0|>> H. CLARKE ROMANS: Well, I'm a 
20110111143323.412|20110111143325.273|TR0|member of a club that no one 
20110111143325.273|20110111143327.133|TR0|wants to belong to. And people 
20110111143327.133|20110111143328.994|TR0|become members when things 
20110111143328.994|20110111143330.854|TR0|happen to them like happened to 
20110111143330.854|20110111143332.715|TR0|my family. My son Kenneth was a 
20110111143332.715|20110111143334.576|TR0|smart, athletic, good-looking, 
20110111143334.576|20110111143336.436|TR0|popular young man, when his 
20110111143336.436|20110111143338.297|TR0|behavior became a little 
20110111143338.297|20110111143340.157|TR0|unusual. And we didn't know what 
20110111143340.157|20110111143342.018|TR0|was going on. And eventually - 
20110111143342.018|20110111143343.879|TR0|we were living in Belgium at the 
20110111143343.879|20110111143345.739|TR0|time - a school counselor at the 
20110111143345.739|20110111143347.600|TR0|International School of Brussels 
20110111143347.600|20110111143349.460|TR0|called us up and said, "Gee, I 
20110111143349.460|20110111143351.321|TR0|think maybe Ken should be out of 
20110111143351.321|20110111143353.182|TR0|school for a while." And we were 
20110111143353.182|20110111143355.042|TR0|like, "What?" So we went to the 
20110111143355.042|20110111143356.903|TR0|school. Ultimately we took Ken 
20110111143356.903|20110111143358.764|TR0|to the doctor, a psychiatrist. 
20110111143358.764|20110111143400.624|TR0|And the doctor told us Kenneth 
20110111143400.624|20110111143402.485|TR0|is suffering from the symptoms 
20110111143402.485|20110111143404.345|TR0|of schizophrenia.
20110111143404.345|20110111143406.206|TR0|
20110111143406.206|20110111143408.067|TR0|Well, I'm a highly educated, 
20110111143408.067|20110111143409.927|TR0|intelligent man. I couldn't 
20110111143409.927|20110111143411.788|TR0|spell "schizophrenia," let alone 
20110111143411.788|20110111143413.648|TR0|have any idea what a devastating 
20110111143413.648|20110111143415.509|TR0|effect that was going to have on 
20110111143415.509|20110111143417.370|TR0|Kenneth, on the family, and for 
20110111143417.370|20110111143419.230|TR0|the rest of his life. And so, 
20110111143419.230|20110111143421.091|TR0|even though my son was killed by 
20110111143421.091|20110111143422.951|TR0|a drunk driver here in Tucson on 
20110111143422.951|20110111143424.812|TR0|September 11th, 2001, I'm still 
20110111143424.812|20110111143426.673|TR0|involved, because I think the 
20110111143426.673|20110111143428.533|TR0|indignities that Kenneth 
20110111143428.533|20110111143430.394|TR0|suffered in his life were not 
20110111143430.394|20110111143432.255|TR0|right, and I don't want to see 
20110111143432.255|20110111143434.115|TR0|that happen to other people.
20110111143434.115|20110111143435.976|TR0|
20110111143435.976|20110111143437.836|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What about 
20110111143437.836|20110111143439.697|TR0|schools reporting? I mean, the 
20110111143439.697|20110111143441.558|TR0|teacher who alerted you, that's 
20110111143441.558|20110111143443.418|TR0|very important. But here was 
20110111143443.418|20110111143445.279|TR0|Jared Loughner in college. Every 
20110111143445.279|20110111143447.139|TR0|classroom, it seemed, the kids, 
20110111143447.139|20110111143449.000|TR0|the students, the professors 
20110111143449.000|20110111143450.861|TR0|were concerned. They were 
20110111143450.861|20110111143452.721|TR0|scared. He was very disruptive. 
20110111143452.721|20110111143454.582|TR0|What does it mean for a school 
20110111143454.582|20110111143456.442|TR0|to get involved? And why don't 
20110111143456.442|20110111143458.303|TR0|they? I mean, in this case, Pima 
20110111143458.303|20110111143500.164|TR0|County Community College says

20110111143503.885|20110111143505.746|TR0|>> H. CLARKE ROMANS: Well, I 
20110111143505.746|20110111143507.606|TR0|think there are two levels here, 
20110111143507.606|20110111143509.467|TR0|and the rules of the game are 
20110111143509.467|20110111143511.327|TR0|very different. When students 
20110111143511.327|20110111143513.188|TR0|are in high school and they're 
20110111143513.188|20110111143515.049|TR0|minors, the school and the 
20110111143515.049|20110111143516.909|TR0|parents have a little more 
20110111143516.909|20110111143518.770|TR0|control. I mean, a few articles 
20110111143518.770|20110111143520.630|TR0|that I've read so far in the 
20110111143520.630|20110111143522.491|TR0|local paper indicate that some 
20110111143522.491|20110111143524.352|TR0|of these behaviors were already 
20110111143524.352|20110111143526.212|TR0|manifesting themselves in the - 
20110111143526.212|20110111143528.073|TR0|in high school. I mean, I read 
20110111143528.073|20110111143529.934|TR0|some of his high school 
20110111143529.934|20110111143531.794|TR0|classmates reported, you know, 
20110111143531.794|20110111143533.655|TR0|unusual behavior.
20110111143533.655|20110111143535.515|TR0|
20110111143535.515|20110111143537.376|TR0|The difficulty for secondary 
20110111143537.376|20110111143539.237|TR0|schools is that if the teachers 
20110111143539.237|20110111143541.097|TR0|bring things to the attention of 
20110111143541.097|20110111143542.958|TR0|the parents and the parents take 
20110111143542.958|20110111143544.818|TR0|it to heart, that the school 
20110111143544.818|20110111143546.679|TR0|becomes financially responsible 
20110111143546.679|20110111143548.540|TR0|for a lot of assistance that the 
20110111143548.540|20110111143550.400|TR0|student might get. And due to 
20110111143550.400|20110111143552.261|TR0|budget cuts, a lot of principals 
20110111143552.261|20110111143554.121|TR0|and teachers, more or less, are 
20110111143554.121|20110111143555.982|TR0|instructed: don't get involved, 
20110111143555.982|20110111143557.843|TR0|because if you do, the school is 
20110111143557.843|20110111143559.703|TR0|going to be financially 
20110111143559.703|20110111143601.564|TR0|responsible. And the schools are 
20110111143601.564|20110111143603.425|TR0|under tremendous financial 
20110111143603.425|20110111143605.285|TR0|pressure. So I think that's a 
20110111143605.285|20110111143607.146|TR0|negative influence on the 
20110111143607.146|20110111143609.006|TR0|teachers. Even though school 
20110111143609.006|20110111143610.867|TR0|counselors and teachers deal 
20110111143610.867|20110111143612.728|TR0|with these students every day, 
20110111143612.728|20110111143614.588|TR0|they're under kind of physical 
20110111143614.588|20110111143616.449|TR0|constraints.
20110111143616.449|20110111143618.309|TR0|
20110111143618.309|20110111143620.170|TR0|When you get to college, it's a 
20110111143620.170|20110111143622.031|TR0|different story, because, you 
20110111143622.031|20110111143623.891|TR0|know, by that time, generally 
20110111143623.891|20110111143625.752|TR0|the students are considered 
20110111143625.752|20110111143627.612|TR0|adults. The parents really don't 
20110111143627.612|20110111143629.473|TR0|have any specific legal 
20110111143629.473|20110111143631.334|TR0|authority to force the person to 
20110111143631.334|20110111143633.194|TR0|do any particular thing. And 
20110111143633.194|20110111143635.055|TR0|only if a person is petitioned 
20110111143635.055|20110111143636.916|TR0|into the hospital due to their 
20110111143636.916|20110111143638.776|TR0|persistent behavior, there's no 
20110111143638.776|20110111143640.637|TR0|way to force them to get 
20110111143640.637|20110111143642.497|TR0|treatment. They can be 
20110111143642.497|20110111143644.358|TR0|persuaded, and the college and 
20110111143644.358|20110111143646.219|TR0|the parents, I believe, have a 
20110111143646.219|20110111143648.079|TR0|role, a potential role, in 
20110111143648.079|20110111143649.940|TR0|persuading an individual to get 
20110111143649.940|20110111143651.800|TR0|help. I don't know if the 
20110111143651.800|20110111143653.661|TR0|college did anything other than 
20110111143653.661|20110111143655.522|TR0|react to the negative behavior.

20110111143701.103|20110111143702.964|TR0|the comment about the 
20110111143702.964|20110111143704.825|TR0|hate-filled language coming out 
20110111143704.825|20110111143706.685|TR0|of TV, radio, the talk shows. 
20110111143706.685|20110111143708.546|TR0|You have Jesse Kelly, the

20110111143710.407|20110111143712.267|TR0|Giffords, who put out a slogan 
20110111143712.267|20110111143714.128|TR0|that said something about 
20110111143714.128|20110111143715.988|TR0|targeting, taking on Giffords 
20110111143715.988|20110111143717.849|TR0|and bringing your M16 to a rally 
20110111143717.849|20110111143719.710|TR0|for Kelly. H. Clarke Romans, 
20110111143719.710|20110111143721.570|TR0|what this kind of explosive 
20110111143721.570|20110111143723.431|TR0|language does?
20110111143723.431|20110111143725.291|TR0|
20110111143725.291|20110111143727.152|TR0|>> H. CLARKE ROMANS: Well, I 
20110111143727.152|20110111143729.013|TR0|think that it doesn't help, 
20110111143729.013|20110111143730.873|TR0|particularly people who may have 
20110111143730.873|20110111143732.734|TR0|thought disorders or mood 
20110111143732.734|20110111143734.595|TR0|disorders, the part of their 
20110111143734.595|20110111143736.455|TR0|brain that would exercise 
20110111143736.455|20110111143738.316|TR0|caution - I mean, anybody that 
20110111143738.316|20110111143740.176|TR0|hears that kind of language may 
20110111143740.176|20110111143742.037|TR0|react to it. But people who are 
20110111143742.037|20110111143743.898|TR0|suffering from these mental 
20110111143743.898|20110111143745.758|TR0|process disorders don't 
20110111143745.758|20110111143747.619|TR0|necessarily have the part of 
20110111143747.619|20110111143749.479|TR0|their brain that would set the 
20110111143749.479|20110111143751.340|TR0|boundaries. The cautionary or 
20110111143751.340|20110111143753.201|TR0|the commonsense parts of their 
20110111143753.201|20110111143755.061|TR0|thinking are not functioning 
20110111143755.061|20110111143756.922|TR0|properly. So, this kind of 
20110111143756.922|20110111143758.782|TR0|language has a much greater 
20110111143758.782|20110111143800.643|TR0|impact on individuals who are in 
20110111143800.643|20110111143802.504|TR0|that situation than on the 
20110111143802.504|20110111143804.364|TR0|average person who has, you 
20110111143804.364|20110111143806.225|TR0|know, the control of their 
20110111143806.225|20110111143808.086|TR0|thought processes and has in 
20110111143808.086|20110111143809.946|TR0|place the normal cautionary and 
20110111143809.946|20110111143811.807|TR0|restraining parts of the thought 
20110111143811.807|20110111143813.667|TR0|process. Many of these 
20110111143813.667|20110111143815.528|TR0|individuals, that part of their 
20110111143815.528|20110111143817.389|TR0|brain is not functioning 
20110111143817.389|20110111143819.249|TR0|properly, with bipolar disorder 
20110111143819.249|20110111143821.110|TR0|or schizophrenia. There's all 
20110111143821.110|20110111143822.970|TR0|kinds of thoughts going on, and 
20110111143822.970|20110111143824.831|TR0|the normal constraints and 
20110111143824.831|20110111143826.692|TR0|rational thinking processes 
20110111143826.692|20110111143828.552|TR0|aren't there. So when you pour 
20110111143828.552|20110111143830.413|TR0|gasoline onto a hot situation, 
20110111143830.413|20110111143832.273|TR0|the likelihood of a fire is a 
20110111143832.273|20110111143834.134|TR0|lot greater than if - you know, 
20110111143834.134|20110111143835.995|TR0|if things are not so, you know,

20110111143847.158|20110111143849.019|TR0|let's remember that

20110111143850.880|20110111143852.740|TR0|said - walked into the hospital 
20110111143852.740|20110111143854.601|TR0|and said that the Tea Party was 
20110111143854.601|20110111143856.461|TR0|her enemy, that he blamed the

20110111144029.492|20110111144031.353|TR0|must be led by prayer and

20110111144033.213|20110111144035.074|TR0|their families. So, please join 
20110111144035.074|20110111144036.934|TR0|me in a moment of silence as we 
20110111144036.934|20110111144038.795|TR0|pray for all of those we've

20110111144224.850|20110111144226.711|TR0|Now! Your thoughts today on

20110111144230.432|20110111144232.292|TR0|hospital in critical condition, 
20110111144232.292|20110111144234.153|TR0|and on being sworn in to the

20110111144245.317|20110111144247.177|TR0|These circumstances are really 
20110111144247.177|20110111144249.038|TR0|not ones that I'd prefer to be 
20110111144249.038|20110111144250.899|TR0|interviewed under, I think as 
20110111144250.899|20110111144252.759|TR0|everyone would agree. However, 
20110111144252.759|20110111144254.620|TR0|yesterday was and continues to 
20110111144254.620|20110111144256.480|TR0|be a surreal experience, the 
20110111144256.480|20110111144258.341|TR0|opening day of the session. 
20110111144258.341|20110111144300.202|TR0|During my time sitting there

20110111144302.062|20110111144303.923|TR0|office, I really could only 
20110111144303.923|20110111144305.783|TR0|think about returning to Tucson 
20110111144305.783|20110111144307.644|TR0|to my community to be near Gabby 
20110111144307.644|20110111144309.505|TR0|and the families and friends of 
20110111144309.505|20110111144311.365|TR0|all of those who were so 
20110111144311.365|20110111144313.226|TR0|affected by the tragedy on

20110111144320.668|20110111144322.529|TR0|legislator, and you're a friend 
20110111144322.529|20110111144324.390|TR0|of Congressmember Giffords. 
20110111144324.390|20110111144326.250|TR0|Explain briefly, if you will, 
20110111144326.250|20110111144328.111|TR0|what state she is in now. We 
20110111144328.111|20110111144329.971|TR0|know she's in critical condition 
20110111144329.971|20110111144331.832|TR0|in the ICU, in intensive care, 
20110111144331.832|20110111144333.693|TR0|the bullet having gone through 
20110111144333.693|20110111144335.553|TR0|the left side of her brain but 
20110111144335.553|20110111144337.414|TR0|not crossing the hemispheres, 
20110111144337.414|20110111144339.274|TR0|which is very important.
20110111144339.274|20110111144341.135|TR0|
20110111144341.135|20110111144342.996|TR0|>> DR. MATT HEINZ: That is 
20110111144342.996|20110111144344.856|TR0|correct. And I will just preface 
20110111144344.856|20110111144346.717|TR0|these comments with the fact 
20110111144346.717|20110111144348.578|TR0|that I have no additional 
20110111144348.578|20110111144350.438|TR0|privileged knowledge beyond what 
20110111144350.438|20110111144352.299|TR0|we've heard in the press 
20110111144352.299|20110111144354.159|TR0|conferences. However, she 
20110111144354.159|20110111144356.020|TR0|continues to be in - sedated, 
20110111144356.020|20110111144357.881|TR0|chemically so, with medications 
20110111144357.881|20110111144359.741|TR0|that she's being given by her 
20110111144359.741|20110111144401.602|TR0|medical team for her safety, to 
20110111144401.602|20110111144403.462|TR0|aid in her recovery. She is on a 
20110111144403.462|20110111144405.323|TR0|breathing machine, on a 
20110111144405.323|20110111144407.184|TR0|ventilator, that is breathing 
20110111144407.184|20110111144409.044|TR0|for her at this time. She has 
20110111144409.044|20110111144410.905|TR0|had, of course, surgery to 
20110111144410.905|20110111144412.765|TR0|remove damaged tissue from the 
20110111144412.765|20110111144414.626|TR0|affected area of the brain, 
20110111144414.626|20110111144416.487|TR0|which fortunately was a very 
20110111144416.487|20110111144418.347|TR0|minimal amount, according to her 
20110111144418.347|20110111144420.208|TR0|surgeons that we've heard from. 
20110111144420.208|20110111144422.069|TR0|And we, at this point, are 
20110111144422.069|20110111144423.929|TR0|waiting for swelling, which 
20110111144423.929|20110111144425.790|TR0|always occurs in these sorts of 
20110111144425.790|20110111144427.650|TR0|injuries, to diminish, which it 
20110111144427.650|20110111144429.511|TR0|appears to be, according to her 
20110111144429.511|20110111144431.372|TR0|medical team, over the past 
20110111144431.372|20110111144433.232|TR0|three days. And that is 
20110111144433.232|20110111144435.093|TR0|excellent.

20110111144455.560|20110111144457.420|TR0|you will be trying to change 
20110111144457.420|20110111144459.281|TR0|them? And explain what they are.
20110111144459.281|20110111144501.141|TR0|
20110111144501.141|20110111144503.002|TR0|>> DR. MATT HEINZ: Sure. And the 
20110111144503.002|20110111144504.863|TR0|- you're referring to the two - 
20110111144504.863|20110111144506.723|TR0|those two specific bills you 
20110111144506.723|20110111144508.584|TR0|mentioned. Again, the session 
20110111144508.584|20110111144510.444|TR0|just started literally 
20110111144510.444|20110111144512.305|TR0|yesterday. There have been no 
20110111144512.305|20110111144514.166|TR0|committees, no hearings. No 
20110111144514.166|20110111144516.026|TR0|bills have been actually heard 
20110111144516.026|20110111144517.887|TR0|officially at this time. I would 
20110111144517.887|20110111144519.748|TR0|say, at least broadly, the 
20110111144519.748|20110111144521.608|TR0|discussion, I think, is for 
20110111144521.608|20110111144523.469|TR0|loosening regulations on our 
20110111144523.469|20110111144525.329|TR0|already rather lax gun laws in 
20110111144525.329|20110111144527.190|TR0|the state, I believe. I don't 
20110111144527.190|20110111144529.051|TR0|think it's time for that kind of 
20110111144529.051|20110111144530.911|TR0|discussion. And especially with 
20110111144530.911|20110111144532.772|TR0|regard to House bill 2001, I 
20110111144532.772|20110111144534.632|TR0|just - I think it's just 
20110111144534.632|20110111144536.493|TR0|entirely inappropriate to even 
20110111144536.493|20110111144538.354|TR0|be broaching that topic right 
20110111144538.354|20110111144540.214|TR0|now, and I hope that the sponsor 
20110111144540.214|20110111144542.075|TR0|would be willing to withdraw 
20110111144542.075|20110111144543.935|TR0|this to another time, where it 
20110111144543.935|20110111144545.796|TR0|could be more properly debated.

20110111144547.657|20110111144549.517|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You're saying, 
20110111144549.517|20110111144551.378|TR0|because you don't want to raise 
20110111144551.378|20110111144553.239|TR0|- this is the one in school, 
20110111144553.239|20110111144555.099|TR0|that students and professors 
20110111144555.099|20110111144556.960|TR0|should be able to carry guns in 
20110111144556.960|20110111144558.820|TR0|school?

20110111144609.984|20110111144611.845|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And the law that 
20110111144611.845|20110111144613.705|TR0|is already in effect that allows 
20110111144613.705|20110111144615.566|TR0|people to carry concealed 
20110111144615.566|20110111144617.426|TR0|weapons without a permit, is 
20110111144617.426|20110111144619.287|TR0|there a discussion of that being 
20110111144619.287|20110111144621.148|TR0|repealed?

20110111144623.008|20110111144624.869|TR0|>> DR. MATT HEINZ: I have not 
20110111144624.869|20110111144626.730|TR0|heard one to this point. This 
20110111144626.730|20110111144628.590|TR0|was - during my first two years 
20110111144628.590|20110111144630.451|TR0|in the legislature, this was one 
20110111144630.451|20110111144632.311|TR0|of the efforts that many folks 
20110111144632.311|20110111144634.172|TR0|in the gun lobby were very - 
20110111144634.172|20110111144636.033|TR0|pushed very hard to remove the 
20110111144636.033|20110111144637.893|TR0|requirement to have any sort of 
20110111144637.893|20110111144639.754|TR0|permit or training to be allowed 
20110111144639.754|20110111144641.614|TR0|to carry a concealed weapon. And 
20110111144641.614|20110111144643.475|TR0|also a law was pushed through 
20110111144643.475|20110111144645.336|TR0|the legislature that allows for 
20110111144645.336|20110111144647.196|TR0|folks to bring a concealed 
20110111144647.196|20110111144649.057|TR0|weapon into a bar or a 
20110111144649.057|20110111144650.918|TR0|restaurant, which I certainly 
20110111144650.918|20110111144652.778|TR0|take exception to, as well.
20110111144652.778|20110111144654.639|TR0|
20110111144654.639|20110111144656.499|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Your 
20110111144656.499|20110111144658.360|TR0|understanding of the climate? 
20110111144658.360|20110111144700.221|TR0|It's something that your friend, 
20110111144700.221|20110111144702.081|TR0|Congressmember Gabby Giffords, 
20110111144702.081|20110111144703.942|TR0|was deeply concerned about, 
20110111144703.942|20110111144705.802|TR0|obviously. Congressmember Moran 
20110111144705.802|20110111144707.663|TR0|said she had raised her concern 
20110111144707.663|20110111144709.524|TR0|about the level of vitriolic 
20110111144709.524|20110111144711.384|TR0|language, hate. She already had 
20110111144711.384|20110111144713.245|TR0|the glass door of her office 
20110111144713.245|20110111144715.105|TR0|either shot in or somehow broken 
20110111144715.105|20110111144716.966|TR0|after the healthcare vote.

20110111144718.827|20110111144720.687|TR0|>> DR. MATT HEINZ: Right.

20110111144722.548|20110111144724.409|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: She said she was 
20110111144724.409|20110111144726.269|TR0|concerned about coming back to 
20110111144726.269|20110111144728.130|TR0|Arizona.
20110111144728.130|20110111144729.990|TR0|
20110111144729.990|20110111144731.851|TR0|>> DR. MATT HEINZ: That is 
20110111144731.851|20110111144733.712|TR0|right. And, you know, this is - 
20110111144733.712|20110111144735.572|TR0|this really isn't new. During 
20110111144735.572|20110111144737.433|TR0|the campaign, at a particular 
20110111144737.433|20110111144739.293|TR0|forum, as I recall, at one 
20110111144739.293|20110111144741.154|TR0|particular event, there was a - 
20110111144741.154|20110111144743.015|TR0|I believe a weapon fell out of 
20110111144743.015|20110111144744.875|TR0|somebody's pocket, which, again, 
20110111144744.875|20110111144746.736|TR0|is not illegal to be carrying a 
20110111144746.736|20110111144748.596|TR0|weapon, but this issue has 
20110111144748.596|20110111144750.457|TR0|surrounded particularly 
20110111144750.457|20110111144752.318|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords for some 
20110111144752.318|20110111144754.178|TR0|time now. And in her own words, 
20110111144754.178|20110111144756.039|TR0|as we've been seeing replayed on 
20110111144756.039|20110111144757.900|TR0|virtually all the networks, 
20110111144757.900|20110111144759.760|TR0|regarding some of the vitriol, 
20110111144759.760|20110111144801.621|TR0|some of the way that the 
20110111144801.621|20110111144803.481|TR0|discussion during the campaign 
20110111144803.481|20110111144805.342|TR0|was framed, she was calling into 
20110111144805.342|20110111144807.203|TR0|- calling attention to it and 
20110111144807.203|20110111144809.063|TR0|expressing her very - her 
20110111144809.063|20110111144810.924|TR0|concerns about the consequences 
20110111144810.924|20110111144812.784|TR0|that could result from such 
20110111144812.784|20110111144814.645|TR0|discussion and discourse.

20110111144816.506|20110111144818.366|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: There's a lot of 
20110111144818.366|20110111144820.227|TR0|discussion about the extreme 
20110111144820.227|20110111144822.087|TR0|right-wing climate of Arizona. 
20110111144822.087|20110111144823.948|TR0|Even the sheriff, Dupnik, we 
20110111144823.948|20110111144825.809|TR0|spoke to him yesterday, and he 
20110111144825.809|20110111144827.669|TR0|talked about, in his press 
20110111144827.669|20110111144829.530|TR0|conference, Arizona being a 
20110111144829.530|20110111144831.391|TR0|mecca of prejudice and hate. 
20110111144831.391|20110111144833.251|TR0|You're an openly gay legislator, 
20110111144833.251|20110111144835.112|TR0|one of a handful. It's 
20110111144835.112|20110111144836.972|TR0|interesting - Danny Hernandez, 
20110111144836.972|20110111144838.833|TR0|who has gotten so much 
20110111144838.833|20110111144840.694|TR0|attention, the hero who may well 
20110111144840.694|20110111144842.554|TR0|have saved Congressmember 
20110111144842.554|20110111144844.415|TR0|Giffords' life, I have seen him 
20110111144844.415|20110111144846.275|TR0|interviewed nonstop on Fox, on 
20110111144846.275|20110111144848.136|TR0|all of the networks, but I have 
20110111144848.136|20110111144849.997|TR0|not seen him identified as an 
20110111144849.997|20110111144851.857|TR0|openly gay LBGT activist. Those 
20110111144851.857|20110111144853.718|TR0|are his politics on campus at 
20110111144853.718|20110111144855.579|TR0|the University of Arizona. Can 
20110111144855.579|20110111144857.439|TR0|you talk about that?
20110111144857.439|20110111144859.300|TR0|
20110111144859.300|20110111144901.160|TR0|>> DR. MATT HEINZ: Certainly. 
20110111144901.160|20110111144903.021|TR0|And to be honest, I believe this 
20110111144903.021|20110111144904.882|TR0|is the first time I've been 
20110111144904.882|20110111144906.742|TR0|identified thusly. It's not - 
20110111144906.742|20110111144908.603|TR0|Arizona is a very independent 
20110111144908.603|20110111144910.463|TR0|state, and that's - it doesn't 
20110111144910.463|20110111144912.324|TR0|seem to be as big of an issue as 
20110111144912.324|20110111144914.185|TR0|perhaps folks in the rest of the 
20110111144914.185|20110111144916.045|TR0|nation might think. It's really 
20110111144916.045|20110111144917.906|TR0|not come up in any of my own 
20110111144917.906|20110111144919.766|TR0|campaigns, and it has not come 
20110111144919.766|20110111144921.627|TR0|up in any way in my time in the 
20110111144921.627|20110111144923.488|TR0|legislature. And I know Daniel 
20110111144923.488|20110111144925.348|TR0|Hernandez very well; I worked 
20110111144925.348|20110111144927.209|TR0|with him on a piece of 
20110111144927.209|20110111144929.070|TR0|legislation that we were able to 
20110111144929.070|20110111144930.930|TR0|successfully push through and 
20110111144930.930|20110111144932.791|TR0|have signed by the governor, 
20110111144932.791|20110111144934.651|TR0|which is quite difficult. And 
20110111144934.651|20110111144936.512|TR0|these - you know, the issue 
20110111144936.512|20110111144938.373|TR0|regarding his sexuality, my own, 
20110111144938.373|20110111144940.233|TR0|that's not really ever been a 
20110111144940.233|20110111144942.094|TR0|problem here in Tucson, 
20110111144942.094|20110111144943.954|TR0|certainly, and in Phoenix in the 
20110111144943.954|20110111144945.815|TR0|legislature, either.

20110111144949.536|20110111144951.397|TR0|budget cuts, what H. Clarke 
20110111144951.397|20110111144953.257|TR0|Romans was just talking about. I 
20110111144953.257|20110111144955.118|TR0|think after the budget cuts July 
20110111144955.118|20110111144956.979|TR0|1st, what was the figure going 
20110111144956.979|20110111144958.839|TR0|up for people who were seeking 
20110111144958.839|20110111145000.700|TR0|help in Arizona? The figure, the 
20110111145000.700|20110111145002.561|TR0|number of seriously mentally ill 
20110111145002.561|20110111145004.421|TR0|patients needing crisis services 
20110111145004.421|20110111145006.282|TR0|at the Southern Arizona Mental 
20110111145006.282|20110111145008.142|TR0|Health Corporation went up by 
20110111145008.142|20110111145010.003|TR0|123 percent by July 1st. Will 
20110111145010.003|20110111145011.864|TR0|this be reopened, especially 
20110111145011.864|20110111145013.724|TR0|with Jan Brewer, the Governor, 
20110111145013.724|20110111145015.585|TR0|dealing with her own son, who's 
20110111145015.585|20110111145017.445|TR0|been in a state institution for 
20110111145017.445|20110111145019.306|TR0|decades?
20110111145019.306|20110111145021.167|TR0|
20110111145021.167|20110111145023.027|TR0|>> DR. MATT HEINZ: And that is 
20110111145023.027|20110111145024.888|TR0|an excellent question. I think 
20110111145024.888|20110111145026.748|TR0|that this really does frame the 
20110111145026.748|20110111145028.609|TR0|discussion of the budget cuts 
20110111145028.609|20110111145030.470|TR0|regarding the behavioral health 
20110111145030.470|20110111145032.330|TR0|system and our Medicaid system, 
20110111145032.330|20110111145034.191|TR0|which is called Access [AHCCCS] 
20110111145034.191|20110111145036.052|TR0|here. It's so important to 
20110111145036.052|20110111145037.912|TR0|address that, in fact, some of 
20110111145037.912|20110111145039.773|TR0|the proposed cuts that we were 
20110111145039.773|20110111145041.633|TR0|hearing going into the session 
20110111145041.633|20110111145043.494|TR0|would affect 250,000 individuals 
20110111145043.494|20110111145045.355|TR0|who presently have access to 
20110111145045.355|20110111145047.215|TR0|care through our Medicaid 
20110111145047.215|20110111145049.076|TR0|program, including 5,200 
20110111145049.076|20110111145050.936|TR0|individuals who are severe 
20110111145050.936|20110111145052.797|TR0|mentally impaired, who would 
20110111145052.797|20110111145054.658|TR0|then lose access to care. And 
20110111145054.658|20110111145056.518|TR0|that is something that I believe 
20110111145056.518|20110111145058.379|TR0|we must address and do our best 
20110111145058.379|20110111145100.240|TR0|to avoid. And I hope that, with 
20110111145100.240|20110111145102.100|TR0|the Governor's own life 
20110111145102.100|20110111145103.961|TR0|experience in her own family, 
20110111145103.961|20110111145105.821|TR0|that we can rely on her as an 
20110111145105.821|20110111145107.682|TR0|ally to prevent such destructive 
20110111145107.682|20110111145109.543|TR0|cuts, that could certainly lead 
20110111145109.543|20110111145111.403|TR0|to an increase in unstable 
20110111145111.403|20110111145113.264|TR0|individuals, behaviorally 
20110111145113.264|20110111145115.124|TR0|disturbed individuals in our 
20110111145115.124|20110111145116.985|TR0|community, not being able to get 
20110111145116.985|20110111145118.846|TR0|the services they need to 
20110111145118.846|20110111145120.706|TR0|protect themselves and others in

20110111145212.803|20110111145214.664|TR0|Now!, Dr. Carmona. First, your 
20110111145214.664|20110111145216.525|TR0|reaction to what has taken place?
20110111145216.525|20110111145218.385|TR0|
20110111145218.385|20110111145220.246|TR0|>> DR. RICHARD CARMONA: Well, 
20110111145220.246|20110111145222.106|TR0|like most of the community, I am 
20110111145222.106|20110111145223.967|TR0|devastated. I know many of the 
20110111145223.967|20110111145225.828|TR0|people. Gabrielle Giffords is a 
20110111145225.828|20110111145227.688|TR0|good friend of mine. I've known 
20110111145227.688|20110111145229.549|TR0|her for years. I know her 
20110111145229.549|20110111145231.409|TR0|family. The judge, I know and 
20110111145231.409|20110111145233.270|TR0|work with. His children went to 
20110111145233.270|20110111145235.131|TR0|school with my children in the 
20110111145235.131|20110111145236.991|TR0|same high school. So there's a 
20110111145236.991|20110111145238.852|TR0|lot of personal connections. But 
20110111145238.852|20110111145240.713|TR0|bigger than that is just the 
20110111145240.713|20110111145242.573|TR0|devastation it's brought to the 
20110111145242.573|20110111145244.434|TR0|community, the loss of 
20110111145244.434|20110111145246.294|TR0|innocence, the loss of a sense 
20110111145246.294|20110111145248.155|TR0|of security in your own 
20110111145248.155|20110111145250.016|TR0|community. And it's something 
20110111145250.016|20110111145251.876|TR0|we're going to have to deal 
20110111145251.876|20110111145253.737|TR0|with, you know, for the 
20110111145253.737|20110111145255.597|TR0|foreseeable future as we heal 
20110111145255.597|20110111145257.458|TR0|from this very terrible tragedy.
20110111145257.458|20110111145259.319|TR0|
20110111145259.319|20110111145301.179|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You've heard the 
20110111145301.179|20110111145303.040|TR0|discussion we've been having for 
20110111145303.040|20110111145304.901|TR0|this hour, talking about the 
20110111145304.901|20110111145306.761|TR0|cuts in mental health, talking 
20110111145306.761|20110111145308.622|TR0|about the gun laws. Now, you are 
20110111145308.622|20110111145310.482|TR0|- you're the former surgeon 
20110111145310.482|20110111145312.343|TR0|general of the United States. 
20110111145312.343|20110111145314.204|TR0|You served under President Bush. 
20110111145314.204|20110111145316.064|TR0|You were his appointee. The 
20110111145316.064|20110111145317.925|TR0|assault weapons ban sunsetted 
20110111145317.925|20110111145319.785|TR0|under President Bush. What are 
20110111145319.785|20110111145321.646|TR0|your thoughts about your gun 
20110111145321.646|20110111145323.507|TR0|laws?
20110111145323.507|20110111145325.367|TR0|
20110111145325.367|20110111145327.228|TR0|>> DR. RICHARD CARMONA: Well, I 
20110111145327.228|20110111145329.088|TR0|think we need some thoughtful 
20110111145329.088|20110111145330.949|TR0|people around the table. 
20110111145330.949|20110111145332.810|TR0|Clearly, we want to make sure 
20110111145332.810|20110111145334.670|TR0|that anybody who owns a weapon 
20110111145334.670|20110111145336.531|TR0|legally has the appropriate 
20110111145336.531|20110111145338.392|TR0|training, education, and that we 
20110111145338.392|20110111145340.252|TR0|can be assured that society is 
20110111145340.252|20110111145342.113|TR0|safe with a person who owns a 
20110111145342.113|20110111145343.973|TR0|weapon. We do the same thing for 
20110111145343.973|20110111145345.834|TR0|automobiles or any other 
20110111145345.834|20110111145347.695|TR0|technology, if you will, that 
20110111145347.695|20110111145349.555|TR0|the average citizen gets to use. 
20110111145349.555|20110111145351.416|TR0|We ensure that they can use it 
20110111145351.416|20110111145353.276|TR0|safely, because we always have 
20110111145353.276|20110111145355.137|TR0|to look at the greater good of 
20110111145355.137|20110111145356.998|TR0|society. So I think that, you 
20110111145356.998|20110111145358.858|TR0|know, we need to stop the 
20110111145358.858|20110111145400.719|TR0|partisan bickering, blaming each 
20110111145400.719|20110111145402.579|TR0|side of the aisle. Thoughtful 
20110111145402.579|20110111145404.440|TR0|people, in an adult manner, need 
20110111145404.440|20110111145406.301|TR0|to sit down and tackle these 
20110111145406.301|20110111145408.161|TR0|very difficult problems. And 
20110111145408.161|20110111145410.022|TR0|after all, that's what these 
20110111145410.022|20110111145411.883|TR0|elected officials have been 
20110111145411.883|20110111145413.743|TR0|elected for: to make good 
20110111145413.743|20110111145415.604|TR0|decisions on behalf of the

20110111145421.186|20110111145423.046|TR0|think is most important to move 
20110111145423.046|20110111145424.907|TR0|forward on now in terms of 
20110111145424.907|20110111145426.767|TR0|legislation or in repealing

20110111145430.489|20110111145432.349|TR0|>> DR. RICHARD CARMONA: Well, 
20110111145432.349|20110111145434.210|TR0|first and foremost, I mean, 
20110111145434.210|20110111145436.071|TR0|rather than just focus on just 
20110111145436.071|20110111145437.931|TR0|the weapons, I think we need to 
20110111145437.931|20110111145439.792|TR0|first start healing from this 
20110111145439.792|20110111145441.652|TR0|extraordinary tragedy that has 
20110111145441.652|20110111145443.513|TR0|clouded our community. And it's 
20110111145443.513|20110111145445.374|TR0|going to take a while. As we 
20110111145445.374|20110111145447.234|TR0|move forward, I believe that we 
20110111145447.234|20110111145449.095|TR0|need to begin a thoughtful 
20110111145449.095|20110111145450.955|TR0|dialogue with elected officials, 
20110111145450.955|20110111145452.816|TR0|with community leaders, and 
20110111145452.816|20110111145454.677|TR0|address many of these issues 
20110111145454.677|20110111145456.537|TR0|that are germane to the problem 
20110111145456.537|20110111145458.398|TR0|we had - the issue of mental 
20110111145458.398|20110111145500.258|TR0|health, the issue of weapon 
20110111145500.258|20110111145502.119|TR0|ownership, the issue of where 
20110111145502.119|20110111145503.980|TR0|weapons can be carried. All of 
20110111145503.980|20110111145505.840|TR0|those things are very, very 
20110111145505.840|20110111145507.701|TR0|important. And there are no 
20110111145507.701|20110111145509.562|TR0|right answers. These debates 
20110111145509.562|20110111145511.422|TR0|change over time as society 
20110111145511.422|20110111145513.283|TR0|evolves. But again, thoughtful 
20110111145513.283|20110111145515.143|TR0|people in a nonpartisan manner 
20110111145515.143|20110111145517.004|TR0|need to tackle these very 
20110111145517.004|20110111145518.865|TR0|difficult problems and come up 
20110111145518.865|20110111145520.725|TR0|with the best solutions in a 
20110111145520.725|20110111145522.586|TR0|very complex society, which we 
20110111145522.586|20110111145524.446|TR0|hold dear, which is a democratic 
20110111145524.446|20110111145526.307|TR0|society where people have a 
20110111145526.307|20110111145528.168|TR0|diversity of opinions.
20110111145528.168|20110111145530.028|TR0|
20110111145530.028|20110111145531.889|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Carmona, you 
20110111145531.889|20110111145533.749|TR0|work in the sheriff's department 
20110111145533.749|20110111145535.610|TR0|under Sheriff Dupnik. He has 
20110111145535.610|20110111145537.471|TR0|raised this issue repeatedly in 
20110111145537.471|20110111145539.331|TR0|his news conferences and on 
20110111145539.331|20110111145541.192|TR0|Democracy Now! yesterday, that 
20110111145541.192|20110111145543.053|TR0|Arizona is the "tombstone of the 
20110111145543.053|20110111145544.913|TR0|United States of America" when 
20110111145544.913|20110111145546.774|TR0|it comes to gun laws. And he 
20110111145546.774|20110111145548.634|TR0|talked about it being the mecca 
20110111145548.634|20110111145550.495|TR0|of prejudice and hate with the 
20110111145550.495|20110111145552.356|TR0|level of vitriol and hatred in 
20110111145552.356|20110111145554.216|TR0|the discourse on television, on 
20110111145554.216|20110111145556.077|TR0|radio, and particularly on the 
20110111145556.077|20110111145557.937|TR0|stations in Arizona. Do you 
20110111145557.937|20110111145559.798|TR0|share his view? And how would 
20110111145559.798|20110111145601.659|TR0|you change it?
20110111145601.659|20110111145603.519|TR0|
20110111145603.519|20110111145605.380|TR0|>> DR. RICHARD CARMONA: Well, 
20110111145605.380|20110111145607.240|TR0|first and foremost, let me say 
20110111145607.240|20110111145609.101|TR0|there are few public servants at 
20110111145609.101|20110111145610.962|TR0|the level of Sheriff Dupnik, who 
20110111145610.962|20110111145612.822|TR0|has served over half a century 
20110111145612.822|20110111145614.683|TR0|as a police officer in this 
20110111145614.683|20110111145616.544|TR0|community. He is deeply wounded 
20110111145616.544|20110111145618.404|TR0|himself from what happened. I've 
20110111145618.404|20110111145620.265|TR0|seen the tears shed. I've been 
20110111145620.265|20110111145622.125|TR0|with him as he painfully 
20110111145622.125|20110111145623.986|TR0|reviewed what had happened in 
20110111145623.986|20110111145625.847|TR0|his own jurisdiction. So this is 
20110111145625.847|20110111145627.707|TR0|not only a law enforcement 
20110111145627.707|20110111145629.568|TR0|officer; this is a citizen 
20110111145629.568|20110111145631.428|TR0|speaking with emotion that 
20110111145631.428|20110111145633.289|TR0|really is something he's never 
20110111145633.289|20110111145635.150|TR0|experienced before in his whole 
20110111145635.150|20110111145637.010|TR0|life.
20110111145637.010|20110111145638.871|TR0|
20110111145638.871|20110111145640.732|TR0|For me, my vantage point is in 
20110111145640.732|20110111145642.592|TR0|several areas. I have been in 
20110111145642.592|20110111145644.453|TR0|this community for over a 
20110111145644.453|20110111145646.313|TR0|quarter of a century. I was the 
20110111145646.313|20110111145648.174|TR0|first trauma director and 
20110111145648.174|20110111145650.035|TR0|started this trauma service 
20110111145650.035|20110111145651.895|TR0|here. So I know the EMS system 
20110111145651.895|20110111145653.756|TR0|and the trauma system, and I've 
20110111145653.756|20110111145655.616|TR0|seen a lot of the preventable 
20110111145655.616|20110111145657.477|TR0|tragedies that have happened in 
20110111145657.477|20110111145659.338|TR0|the last25 years in this 
20110111145659.338|20110111145701.198|TR0|community. I've been a police 
20110111145701.198|20110111145703.059|TR0|officer in this community. I've 
20110111145703.059|20110111145704.919|TR0|been a professor at the 
20110111145704.919|20110111145706.780|TR0|university. And last but not 
20110111145706.780|20110111145708.641|TR0|least, I've been surgeon general 
20110111145708.641|20110111145710.501|TR0|of the United States and been 
20110111145710.501|20110111145712.362|TR0|able to take a broader view of 
20110111145712.362|20110111145714.223|TR0|national and global health and 
20110111145714.223|20110111145716.083|TR0|security issues, so that my 
20110111145716.083|20110111145717.944|TR0|vantage point is a unique one.
20110111145717.944|20110111145719.804|TR0|
20110111145719.804|20110111145721.665|TR0|I understand the Sheriff's 
20110111145721.665|20110111145723.526|TR0|emotion. I understand how he was 
20110111145723.526|20110111145725.386|TR0|almost reaching out in grief to 
20110111145725.386|20110111145727.247|TR0|try and warn the people that we 
20110111145727.247|20110111145729.107|TR0|must stop this vitriolic, 
20110111145729.107|20110111145730.968|TR0|divided discussion and come 
20110111145730.968|20110111145732.829|TR0|around and heal, and that this 
20110111145732.829|20110111145734.689|TR0|time in our lives, after this 
20110111145734.689|20110111145736.550|TR0|very terrible tragedy, is a time 
20110111145736.550|20110111145738.410|TR0|that we should begin this 
20110111145738.410|20110111145740.271|TR0|healing process and respect the 
20110111145740.271|20110111145742.132|TR0|civil society, address each 
20110111145742.132|20110111145743.992|TR0|other with dignity and respect, 
20110111145743.992|20110111145745.853|TR0|and agree to disagree, but let's 
20110111145745.853|20110111145747.714|TR0|do it in a professional manner. 
20110111145747.714|20110111145749.574|TR0|I think that's what the Sheriff 
20110111145749.574|20110111145751.435|TR0|was saying, and that's what I 
20110111145751.435|20110111145753.295|TR0|agree needs to occur from this 
20110111145753.295|20110111145755.156|TR0|point on.
20110111145755.156|20110111145757.017|TR0|
20110111145757.017|20110111145758.877|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Do you think, 
20110111145758.877|20110111145800.738|TR0|well, maps with your district in 
20110111145800.738|20110111145802.598|TR0|the crosshairs, that Sarah Palin 
20110111145802.598|20110111145804.459|TR0|put out, or Jesse Kelly saying 
20110111145804.459|20110111145806.320|TR0|bring your M16 and target - 
20110111145806.320|20110111145808.180|TR0|talking about the targeting and 
20110111145808.180|20110111145810.041|TR0|referring to Congressmember 
20110111145810.041|20110111145811.901|TR0|Giffords, are problems?
20110111145811.901|20110111145813.762|TR0|
20110111145813.762|20110111145815.623|TR0|>> DR. RICHARD CARMONA: I think 
20110111145815.623|20110111145817.483|TR0|the divisive rhetoric is a 
20110111145817.483|20110111145819.344|TR0|problem. To single out a single 
20110111145819.344|20110111145821.205|TR0|person probably doesn't make 
20110111145821.205|20110111145823.065|TR0|much sense. The fact of the 
20110111145823.065|20110111145824.926|TR0|matter is that both sides of the 
20110111145824.926|20110111145826.786|TR0|aisle use inflammatory rhetoric 
20110111145826.786|20110111145828.647|TR0|to get their opinions across. 
20110111145828.647|20110111145830.508|TR0|And I think, in a civil society, 
20110111145830.508|20110111145832.368|TR0|we need to tone that down. And 
20110111145832.368|20110111145834.229|TR0|again, I think that's the 
20110111145834.229|20110111145836.089|TR0|message that the Sheriff was 
20110111145836.089|20110111145837.950|TR0|trying to emit, even though it 
20110111145837.950|20110111145839.811|TR0|was in a passionate plea, 
20110111145839.811|20110111145841.671|TR0|because he was so hurt and 
20110111145841.671|20110111145843.532|TR0|wounded himself.
20110111145843.532|20110111145845.393|TR0|
20110111145845.393|20110111145847.253|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Carmona, we 
20110111145847.253|20110111145849.114|TR0|have to leave it there. I thank 
20110111145849.114|20110111145850.974|TR0|you so much for being with us.
