20110111153719.000|20110111153722.000|CC1|REALIZE, HE'S 22 YEARS OLD.     
20110111153722.000|20110111153725.000|CC1|HE MAKES HIS OWN DECISIONS, BUT

20110111153746.000|20110111153747.000|CC1|PLANNED AND NOT RANDOM.         
20110111153747.000|20110111153748.000|CC1|>> WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ME,

20110111153812.000|20110111153815.000|CC1|SO AGAIN, WE HAVE THIS FOCUS    
20110111153815.000|20110111153817.000|CC1|THAT WAS TAKING PLACE BUT HE    
20110111153817.000|20110111153818.000|CC1|KEPT EVERYTHING IT APPEARS      
20110111153818.000|20110111153820.000|CC1|RELATED TO HER LOCKED IN THIS

20110111153820.000|20110111153822.000|CC1|SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS MOST       
20110111153822.000|20110111153822.000|CC1|IMPORTANT.                      
20110111153822.000|20110111153824.000|CC1|THAT'S WHAT HE COULD GO BACK TO 
20110111153824.000|20110111153826.000|CC1|AND REFER TO AND THEN CLOSE THE 
20110111153826.000|20110111153828.000|CC1|DOOR ON THAT SAFE AND LOCK IT

20110111154819.000|20110111154820.000|CC1|BECAUSE IT USED TO BE AT LEAST  
20110111154820.000|20110111154821.000|CC1|THAT WE TRIED TO KEEP THEM OUT  
20110111154821.000|20110111154823.000|CC1|OF THAT AND THEY DON'T AT ALL.  
20110111154823.000|20110111154825.000|CC1|BUT THERE IS -- THEY WERE
