20110111030023.000|20110111030026.000|TR0|Terror in Tucson: the very latest in the 
20110111030026.000|20110111030028.000|TR0|killing of a small child, a federal judge, 
20110111030028.000|20110111030030.000|TR0|and four others, and the near deadly 
20110111030030.000|20110111030032.000|TR0|shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110111030032.000|20110111030034.000|TR0|Giffords.  President Obama going to Tucson

20110111030038.000|20110111030040.000|TR0|In the hour ahead tonight: a portrait of 
20110111030040.000|20110111030043.000|TR0|the suspect, Jared Loughner, his mug shot 
20110111030043.000|20110111030045.000|TR0|released today.  We're going to tell you 
20110111030045.000|20110111030047.000|TR0|what he said in court and what was 
20110111030047.000|20110111030049.000|TR0|allegedly found in his home that seems to 
20110111030049.000|20110111030051.000|TR0|indicate this was very premeditated.
20110111030051.000|20110111030053.000|TR0|
20110111030053.000|20110111030055.000|TR0|We also have details of what he was like, 
20110111030055.000|20110111030057.000|TR0|signs of instability, even warnings from 
20110111030057.000|20110111030059.000|TR0|those who knew him.  One teacher worried 
20110111030059.000|20110111030102.000|TR0|he would end up shooting up his school.  
20110111030102.000|20110111030104.000|TR0|We will talk with those who knew him and 
20110111030104.000|20110111030106.000|TR0|worried about him long before he allegedly 
20110111030106.000|20110111030108.000|TR0|started shooting.
20110111030108.000|20110111030110.000|TR0|
20110111030110.000|20110111030112.000|TR0|Also tonight: the critical hours and days 
20110111030112.000|20110111030114.000|TR0|ahead for Congresswoman Giffords, how 
20110111030114.000|20110111030116.000|TR0|skilled medical care, quick attention, and 
20110111030116.000|20110111030119.000|TR0|the work of heroes on the shooting scene 
20110111030119.000|20110111030121.000|TR0|saved her life.  We're going to talk to 
20110111030121.000|20110111030123.000|TR0|some of those heroes who actually wrestled 
20110111030123.000|20110111030125.000|TR0|the shooter to the ground and maybe helped 
20110111030125.000|20110111030127.000|TR0|saved the congresswoman's life.  We will 
20110111030127.000|20110111030129.000|TR0|also talk to 360 M.D. and neurosurgeon Dr. 
20110111030129.000|20110111030131.000|TR0|Sanjay Gupta.
20110111030131.000|20110111030133.000|TR0|
20110111030133.000|20110111030135.000|TR0|And the littlest victim -- Christina's 
20110111030135.000|20110111030138.000|TR0|story tonight.  Her life began on 9/11, 
20110111030138.000|20110111030140.000|TR0|2001.  That's the day she was born.  It 
20110111030140.000|20110111030142.000|TR0|ended on Saturday.  Tonight, you will hear 
20110111030142.000|20110111030144.000|TR0|directly from her parents, who want you to 
20110111030144.000|20110111030146.000|TR0|know about the bright and brave little 
20110111030146.000|20110111030148.000|TR0|girl they lost and we all lost.
20110111030148.000|20110111030150.000|TR0|
20110111030150.000|20110111030152.000|TR0|We begin, though, with the latest and 
20110111030152.000|20110111030155.000|TR0|perhaps most startling thing to happen 
20110111030155.000|20110111030157.000|TR0|today.  We got our first official look at 
20110111030157.000|20110111030159.000|TR0|Jared Loughner.  This is the ghoulish 
20110111030159.000|20110111030201.000|TR0|photo that was released, his head shaved, 
20110111030201.000|20110111030203.000|TR0|his eyes piercing, the mug shot, a smile 
20110111030203.000|20110111030205.000|TR0|on his face, a slight cut on his head.  
20110111030205.000|20110111030207.000|TR0|Loughner was in federal court today 
20110111030207.000|20110111030209.000|TR0|entering no plea, but answering a judge's 
20110111030209.000|20110111030211.000|TR0|questions about whether he understood the 
20110111030211.000|20110111030214.000|TR0|charges as they were read.
20110111030214.000|20110111030216.000|TR0|
20110111030216.000|20110111030218.000|TR0|The last report indicated he say nothing 
20110111030218.000|20110111030220.000|TR0|-- he's said nothing to authorities about 
20110111030220.000|20110111030222.000|TR0|the killings.  He faces two counts of 
20110111030222.000|20110111030224.000|TR0|murder, two counts of attempted murder, 
20110111030224.000|20110111030226.000|TR0|and one count for attempting to kill a 
20110111030226.000|20110111030228.000|TR0|member of Congress.
20110111030228.000|20110111030231.000|TR0|
20110111030231.000|20110111030233.000|TR0|Now, all the charges relate to attacks on 
20110111030233.000|20110111030235.000|TR0|federal employees at this point, but the 
20110111030235.000|20110111030237.000|TR0|state of Arizona may file additional 
20110111030237.000|20110111030239.000|TR0|charges.  In all, Loughner is accused of 
20110111030239.000|20110111030241.000|TR0|shooting 20 people, killing six of them. 
20110111030241.000|20110111030243.000|TR0|Loughner is scheduled back in court in two 
20110111030243.000|20110111030245.000|TR0|weeks.
20110111030245.000|20110111030247.000|TR0|
20110111030247.000|20110111030250.000|TR0|This is his home.  Court documents today 
20110111030250.000|20110111030252.000|TR0|revealed that inside authorities 
20110111030252.000|20110111030254.000|TR0|discovered an envelope with writing on it 
20110111030254.000|20110111030256.000|TR0|with the words -- quote -- "I planned 
20110111030256.000|20110111030258.000|TR0|ahead, my assassination" and the word 
20110111030258.000|20110111030300.000|TR0|"Giffords."
20110111030300.000|20110111030302.000|TR0|
20110111030302.000|20110111030304.000|TR0|Tonight, we're going to talk to a number 
20110111030304.000|20110111030307.000|TR0|of people who knew this young man, were 
20110111030307.000|20110111030309.000|TR0|concerned about him, raised red flags 
20110111030309.000|20110111030311.000|TR0|about him, about his instability, the 
20110111030311.000|20110111030313.000|TR0|possibility he could resort to violence.
20110111030313.000|20110111030315.000|TR0|
20110111030315.000|20110111030317.000|TR0|But, before we spend even a minute more 
20110111030317.000|20110111030319.000|TR0|talking about this suspect, I want to tell 
20110111030319.000|20110111030321.000|TR0|you about the victims.
20110111030321.000|20110111030323.000|TR0|
20110111030323.000|20110111030326.000|TR0|You know, we spend so much after an 
20110111030326.000|20110111030328.000|TR0|incident like this focusing on the killer. 
20110111030328.000|20110111030330.000|TR0|Everyone remembers his name for years on.  
20110111030330.000|20110111030332.000|TR0|But, all too often, we don't remember the 
20110111030332.000|20110111030334.000|TR0|names of the victims.  And that's a 
20110111030334.000|20110111030336.000|TR0|tragedy.
20110111030336.000|20110111030338.000|TR0|
20110111030338.000|20110111030340.000|TR0|We should remember John M. Roll.  He was 
20110111030340.000|20110111030343.000|TR0|the chief federal judge in Arizona 
20110111030343.000|20110111030345.000|TR0|appointed to the bench by the first 
20110111030345.000|20110111030347.000|TR0|President Bush. Friends describe him as a 
20110111030347.000|20110111030349.000|TR0|quiet, thoughtful man, an avid churchgoer. 
20110111030349.000|20110111030351.000|TR0|He left behind a wife, three sons, five 
20110111030351.000|20110111030353.000|TR0|grandchildren.  And we think of them 
20110111030353.000|20110111030355.000|TR0|tonight.  He was 63 years old.
20110111030355.000|20110111030357.000|TR0|
20110111030357.000|20110111030359.000|TR0|Gabe -- Gabe Zimmerman was a -- was 
20110111030359.000|20110111030402.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords' director of 
20110111030402.000|20110111030404.000|TR0|community outreach.  He was engaged to be 
20110111030404.000|20110111030406.000|TR0|married.  And he was just 30 years old.  
20110111030406.000|20110111030408.000|TR0|And he was think of his family tonight.
20110111030408.000|20110111030410.000|TR0|
20110111030410.000|20110111030412.000|TR0|Dorwin Stoddard, 76 years old.  His family 
20110111030412.000|20110111030414.000|TR0|called him Dory.  He worked construction 
20110111030414.000|20110111030416.000|TR0|before he retired.  He loved his wife.  
20110111030416.000|20110111030419.000|TR0|And he was killed shielding her from the 
20110111030419.000|20110111030421.000|TR0|gunman.  He died saving his beloved wife's 
20110111030421.000|20110111030423.000|TR0|life.
20110111030423.000|20110111030425.000|TR0|
20110111030425.000|20110111030427.000|TR0|Phyllis Schneck was one of the best cooks 
20110111030427.000|20110111030429.000|TR0|you would ever want to find.  That's what 
20110111030429.000|20110111030431.000|TR0|her daughter told a local affiliate.  She 
20110111030431.000|20110111030433.000|TR0|loved jigsaw puzzles.  She was 79.
20110111030433.000|20110111030435.000|TR0|
20110111030435.000|20110111030438.000|TR0|Dorothy Morris was 76.  According to 
20110111030438.000|20110111030440.000|TR0|another affiliate, she was married for 
20110111030440.000|20110111030442.000|TR0|more than half-a-century to husband 
20110111030442.000|20110111030444.000|TR0|George.  Friends say they still live like 
20110111030444.000|20110111030446.000|TR0|newlyweds.  Imagine that.  Both of them 
20110111030446.000|20110111030448.000|TR0|got shot. George survived.  Dorothy did 
20110111030448.000|20110111030450.000|TR0|not.
20110111030450.000|20110111030452.000|TR0|
20110111030452.000|20110111030455.000|TR0|And we should remember Christina Green, 
20110111030455.000|20110111030457.000|TR0|the littlest victim, just 9 years old when 
20110111030457.000|20110111030459.000|TR0|she died, fighting all the way.  She was 
20110111030459.000|20110111030501.000|TR0|an A- student, already deeply interested 
20110111030501.000|20110111030503.000|TR0|in the world around her, even in politics. 
20110111030503.000|20110111030505.000|TR0| Her parents she the sky was the limit for 
20110111030505.000|20110111030507.000|TR0|her.  They talked about her one day 
20110111030507.000|20110111030509.000|TR0|becoming a political leader.
20110111030509.000|20110111030511.000|TR0|
20110111030511.000|20110111030514.000|TR0|You're going to hear directly from them 
20110111030514.000|20110111030516.000|TR0|tonight.  I spoke to them a few hours ago. 
20110111030516.000|20110111030518.000|TR0| And their strength is -- it's just hard 
20110111030518.000|20110111030520.000|TR0|to imagine. They want you to know about 
20110111030520.000|20110111030522.000|TR0|Christina and all the others who died.

20110111031526.000|20110111031528.000|TR0|shooting began, I mean, what was going 
20110111031528.000|20110111031530.000|TR0|through your mind?

20110111031532.000|20110111031534.000|TR0|MAISCH:  When I heard the first shot, I 
20110111031534.000|20110111031536.000|TR0|knew it was a gunshot. And it was just a 
20110111031536.000|20110111031538.000|TR0|momentary pause before he starts shooting 
20110111031538.000|20110111031540.000|TR0|again. And I could see him coming down the 
20110111031540.000|20110111031543.000|TR0|line of people.
20110111031543.000|20110111031545.000|TR0|
20110111031545.000|20110111031547.000|TR0|And I decided it was better to drop on the 
20110111031547.000|20110111031549.000|TR0|ground than to run and make myself a 
20110111031549.000|20110111031551.000|TR0|target.  So, I was standing next to a 
20110111031551.000|20110111031553.000|TR0|woman and her teenage daughter who was 
20110111031553.000|20110111031555.000|TR0|Gabrielle's page for three weeks.  And I 
20110111031555.000|20110111031557.000|TR0|-- I heard and saw them -- the gunman 
20110111031557.000|20110111031600.000|TR0|shooting her.

20110111031606.000|20110111031608.000|TR0|be hit, and thinking about the concrete 
20110111031608.000|20110111031610.000|TR0|and how the bullets might be ricocheting, 
20110111031610.000|20110111031612.000|TR0|and wondering how a bullet felt.  And, 
20110111031612.000|20110111031614.000|TR0|instead, I got to feel how -- how the 
20110111031614.000|20110111031616.000|TR0|gunman coming down right partly on me and 
20110111031616.000|20110111031619.000|TR0|on the sidewalk felt, because Colonel

20110111031631.000|20110111031633.000|TR0|MAISCH:  And, as soon as he hit the 
20110111031633.000|20110111031636.000|TR0|ground, I -- I was...
20110111031636.000|20110111031638.000|TR0|
20110111031638.000|20110111031640.000|TR0|COOPER:  Sorry.  Go ahead.
20110111031640.000|20110111031642.000|TR0|
20110111031642.000|20110111031644.000|TR0|MAISCH:  I was up on my knees.  And 
20110111031644.000|20110111031646.000|TR0|someone shouted get the gun, but I wasn't 
20110111031646.000|20110111031648.000|TR0|able to reach the gun.  And I think 
20110111031648.000|20110111031650.000|TR0|Colonel Badger was able to push it out of 
20110111031650.000|20110111031652.000|TR0|the way with his foot.  I'm not sure about 
20110111031652.000|20110111031655.000|TR0|that.
20110111031655.000|20110111031657.000|TR0|
20110111031657.000|20110111031659.000|TR0|But he grabbed a clip out of his left 
20110111031659.000|20110111031701.000|TR0|pocket and dropped it on the sidewalk, and 
20110111031701.000|20110111031703.000|TR0|was trying to pick it up.  But I managed 
20110111031703.000|20110111031705.000|TR0|to get it, instead of him, and grasped it.
20110111031705.000|20110111031707.000|TR0|
20110111031707.000|20110111031709.000|TR0|Now, Roger and Colonel Badger were 
20110111031709.000|20110111031712.000|TR0|securing him on his upper body, but he was 
20110111031712.000|20110111031714.000|TR0|flailing his legs.  So I kneeled on his 
20110111031714.000|20110111031716.000|TR0|legs until I noticed that Colonel Badger 
20110111031716.000|20110111031718.000|TR0|was bleeding from a wound on his head, and 
20110111031718.000|20110111031720.000|TR0|then asked bystander, who happened to be 
20110111031720.000|20110111031722.000|TR0|Joe, to come and take my place on his legs 
20110111031722.000|20110111031724.000|TR0|while I ran into Safeway and I got...
20110111031724.000|20110111031726.000|TR0|
20110111031726.000|20110111031728.000|TR0|COOPER:  And Joe -- let me give...
20110111031728.000|20110111031731.000|TR0|
20110111031731.000|20110111031733.000|TR0|MAISCH:  ... some towels.
20110111031733.000|20110111031735.000|TR0|
20110111031735.000|20110111031737.000|TR0|COOPER:  Let me bring in Joe.
20110111031737.000|20110111031739.000|TR0|
20110111031739.000|20110111031741.000|TR0|Joe, when the shooting began, you actually 
20110111031741.000|20110111031743.000|TR0|ran toward -- toward the shooter.  What 
20110111031743.000|20110111031745.000|TR0|did you -- what -- what -- could you -- 
20110111031745.000|20110111031748.000|TR0|you could -- did you get a plain look at 
20110111031748.000|20110111031750.000|TR0|him?
20110111031750.000|20110111031752.000|TR0|
20110111031752.000|20110111031754.000|TR0|JOE ZAMUDIO, EYEWITNESS:  I -- I actually 
20110111031754.000|20110111031756.000|TR0|came running out of the store after 
20110111031756.000|20110111031758.000|TR0|hearing the shots.  They were already 
20110111031758.000|20110111031800.000|TR0|wrestling with him. And, at that point, I 
20110111031800.000|20110111031802.000|TR0|actually saw a different gentleman holding 
20110111031802.000|20110111031804.000|TR0|the firearm, and I thought he was the 
20110111031804.000|20110111031807.000|TR0|shooter.
20110111031807.000|20110111031809.000|TR0|
20110111031809.000|20110111031811.000|TR0|But when I arrived there, they -- they 
20110111031811.000|20110111031813.000|TR0|clarified to me, and we were able to hold 
20110111031813.000|20110111031815.000|TR0|him down.  And...
20110111031815.000|20110111031817.000|TR0|
20110111031817.000|20110111031819.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110111031819.000|20110111031821.000|TR0|
20110111031821.000|20110111031824.000|TR0|COOPER:  Was -- was he saying anything?
20110111031824.000|20110111031826.000|TR0|
20110111031826.000|20110111031828.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110111031828.000|20110111031830.000|TR0|
20110111031830.000|20110111031832.000|TR0|ZAMUDIO:  ... I saw him.
20110111031832.000|20110111031834.000|TR0|
20110111031834.000|20110111031836.000|TR0|He -- not except for about his arm.  
20110111031836.000|20110111031838.000|TR0|"You're -- oh, ow, you're -- you're 
20110111031838.000|20110111031840.000|TR0|breaking my arm."
20110111031840.000|20110111031843.000|TR0|
20110111031843.000|20110111031845.000|TR0|COOPER:  So, he was complaining about him 
20110111031845.000|20110111031847.000|TR0|being in pain.
20110111031847.000|20110111031849.000|TR0|
20110111031849.000|20110111031851.000|TR0|Steven, you were crouched behind a 
20110111031851.000|20110111031853.000|TR0|concrete pillar.  Could you -- could you 
20110111031853.000|20110111031855.000|TR0|see Loughner from where you were?
20110111031855.000|20110111031857.000|TR0|
20110111031857.000|20110111031900.000|TR0|DR. STEVEN RAYLE, EYEWITNESS:  I could see 
20110111031900.000|20110111031902.000|TR0|him as he went by.  I did not see him get 
20110111031902.000|20110111031904.000|TR0|tackled.  I was -- at that point, I was 
20110111031904.000|20110111031906.000|TR0|laying on -- on the ground pretending to 
20110111031906.000|20110111031908.000|TR0|be shot, so I wouldn't be a target.
20110111031908.000|20110111031910.000|TR0|
20110111031910.000|20110111031912.000|TR0|COOPER:  What was his demeanor like?  I 
20110111031912.000|20110111031914.000|TR0|mean, did you get a look at his face?
20110111031914.000|20110111031916.000|TR0|
20110111031916.000|20110111031919.000|TR0|RAYLE:  I got a look at his face.  I -- I 
20110111031919.000|20110111031921.000|TR0|saw him shoot Congresswoman Giffords.  And 
20110111031921.000|20110111031923.000|TR0|I got a look at his face.
20110111031923.000|20110111031925.000|TR0|
20110111031925.000|20110111031927.000|TR0|He just seemed very determined.  I -- I -- 
20110111031927.000|20110111031929.000|TR0|I got a brief look.  I mean, I was more 
20110111031929.000|20110111031931.000|TR0|looking at the gun and what was happening 
20110111031931.000|20110111031933.000|TR0|in front, but I couldn't say that he had a 
20110111031933.000|20110111031936.000|TR0|crazed look in his eyes, because I didn't 
20110111031936.000|20110111031938.000|TR0|really see.
20110111031938.000|20110111031940.000|TR0|
20110111031940.000|20110111031942.000|TR0|COOPER:  How close was he to Giffords when 
20110111031942.000|20110111031944.000|TR0|he shot her?
20110111031944.000|20110111031946.000|TR0|
20110111031946.000|20110111031948.000|TR0|RAYLE:  Oh, just a few feet.  I mean, the 
20110111031948.000|20110111031950.000|TR0|gun itself was maybe a foot-and-a-half.
20110111031950.000|20110111031952.000|TR0|
20110111031952.000|20110111031955.000|TR0|COOPER:  And did she see him at all?  Or 
20110111031955.000|20110111031957.000|TR0|was she facing away from him?
20110111031957.000|20110111031959.000|TR0|
20110111031959.000|20110111032001.000|TR0|RAYLE:  She was facing away from him.  I 
20110111032001.000|20110111032003.000|TR0|don't believe she saw him.  I -- I looked 
20110111032003.000|20110111032005.000|TR0|up just as it was happening, so I didn't 
20110111032005.000|20110111032007.000|TR0|see the prelude to it, or him approach 
20110111032007.000|20110111032009.000|TR0|her.  I just looked up as the -- as he 
20110111032009.000|20110111032012.000|TR0|fired the shot.
20110111032012.000|20110111032014.000|TR0|
20110111032014.000|20110111032016.000|TR0|COOPER:  Daniel, you rushed to -- to 
20110111032016.000|20110111032018.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords' aid when you saw 
20110111032018.000|20110111032020.000|TR0|she was -- she was shot.  Was she 
20110111032020.000|20110111032022.000|TR0|conscious still?
20110111032022.000|20110111032024.000|TR0|
20110111032024.000|20110111032026.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  She was alert and she was 
20110111032026.000|20110111032028.000|TR0|conscious the entire time that I was with 
20110111032028.000|20110111032031.000|TR0|her.
20110111032031.000|20110111032033.000|TR0|
20110111032033.000|20110111032035.000|TR0|COOPER:  And you got her up, because you 
20110111032035.000|20110111032037.000|TR0|were concerned about -- about her actually 
20110111032037.000|20110111032039.000|TR0|suffocating on her blood; is that right?
20110111032039.000|20110111032041.000|TR0|
20110111032041.000|20110111032043.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  That's correct.  The original 
20110111032043.000|20110111032045.000|TR0|position she was in, she was a little bit 
20110111032045.000|20110111032048.000|TR0|vulnerable in terms of inhaling the blood 
20110111032048.000|20110111032050.000|TR0|that she had been losing from the wound.
20110111032050.000|20110111032052.000|TR0|
20110111032052.000|20110111032054.000|TR0|COOPER:  How did you know to do that?
20110111032054.000|20110111032056.000|TR0|
20110111032056.000|20110111032058.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  So, I propped her up against 
20110111032058.000|20110111032100.000|TR0|my -- I -- I had taken a certified nursing 
20110111032100.000|20110111032102.000|TR0|assistant course, as well as a phlebotomy 
20110111032102.000|20110111032104.000|TR0|course, and spent some time working in a 
20110111032104.000|20110111032107.000|TR0|hospital.  But it was all very limited 
20110111032107.000|20110111032109.000|TR0|first aid and triage skills.
20110111032109.000|20110111032111.000|TR0|
20110111032111.000|20110111032113.000|TR0|COOPER:  And you actually apply -- I mean, 
20110111032113.000|20110111032115.000|TR0|we all know you're supposed to apply 
20110111032115.000|20110111032117.000|TR0|pressure to wounds.  That's what you did?
20110111032117.000|20110111032119.000|TR0|
20110111032119.000|20110111032121.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  Yes.  Once I had propped up 
20110111032121.000|20110111032124.000|TR0|the -- the congresswoman kind of up 
20110111032124.000|20110111032126.000|TR0|against my chest, I -- and made sure she 
20110111032126.000|20110111032128.000|TR0|was breathing properly, I started applying 
20110111032128.000|20110111032130.000|TR0|pressure to her -- her wound on her head 
20110111032130.000|20110111032132.000|TR0|to try and stem some of the blood loss.
20110111032132.000|20110111032134.000|TR0|
20110111032134.000|20110111032136.000|TR0|COOPER:  What did you use to put pressure 
20110111032136.000|20110111032138.000|TR0|on?
20110111032138.000|20110111032140.000|TR0|
20110111032140.000|20110111032143.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  Originally, my hand, until we 
20110111032143.000|20110111032145.000|TR0|were able to get smocks from inside of the 
20110111032145.000|20110111032147.000|TR0|Safeway.
20110111032147.000|20110111032149.000|TR0|
20110111032149.000|20110111032151.000|TR0|COOPER:  And, Steven, you used to be an 
20110111032151.000|20110111032153.000|TR0|emergency room doctor. What did you do 
20110111032153.000|20110111032155.000|TR0|when you realized that so many people had 
20110111032155.000|20110111032157.000|TR0|been shot?

20110111032200.000|20110111032202.000|TR0|RAYLE:  I tried to -- to triage.  I tended 
20110111032202.000|20110111032204.000|TR0|to those -- obviously, some were -- were 
20110111032204.000|20110111032206.000|TR0|immediately dead.  I could -- I could see 
20110111032206.000|20110111032208.000|TR0|that. People were in very -- there were so 
20110111032208.000|20110111032210.000|TR0|many people that were wounded, I wanted to 
20110111032210.000|20110111032212.000|TR0|make sure that everybody was being treated 
20110111032212.000|20110111032214.000|TR0|appropriately.

20110111032216.000|20110111032219.000|TR0|COOPER:  Daniel, we heard Patricia saying 
20110111032219.000|20110111032221.000|TR0|she doesn't feel like a hero.  What about 
20110111032221.000|20110111032223.000|TR0|you?  Do you -- I mean, I think everybody 
20110111032223.000|20110111032225.000|TR0|would agree all -- all -- what all of you 
20110111032225.000|20110111032227.000|TR0|did, all of you taking action was heroic.  
20110111032227.000|20110111032229.000|TR0|Do you feel like that?

20110111032231.000|20110111032233.000|TR0|HERNANDEZ:  No.  I think the real heroes 
20110111032233.000|20110111032236.000|TR0|are people like Congresswoman Giffords, 
20110111032236.000|20110111032238.000|TR0|Ron Barber, her district director, Gabe 
20110111032238.000|20110111032240.000|TR0|Zimmerman, who we unfortunately lost, and 
20110111032240.000|20110111032242.000|TR0|Pam Simon, because they are people who

20110111032255.000|20110111032257.000|TR0|to helping others.  And they're the true

20110111032309.000|20110111032312.000|TR0|surreal and -- and hard to describe what 
20110111032312.000|20110111032314.000|TR0|the last couple of days have been like.

20110111032350.000|20110111032352.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, Jared Loughner is due back 
20110111032352.000|20110111032354.000|TR0|in court, federal court, two weeks from 
20110111032354.000|20110111032356.000|TR0|now.  He's facing capital charges, 
20110111032356.000|20110111032358.000|TR0|possibly additional state charges.  A 
20110111032358.000|20110111032400.000|TR0|veteran public defender named Judy Clarke 
20110111032400.000|20110111032402.000|TR0|is going to represent him.  Her former 
20110111032402.000|20110111032405.000|TR0|clients include the Unabomber, Ted 
20110111032405.000|20110111032407.000|TR0|Kaczynski.

20110111032409.000|20110111032411.000|TR0|As in that case, his motive and mental 
20110111032411.000|20110111032413.000|TR0|state of this guy may determine what 
20110111032413.000|20110111032415.000|TR0|happens to him if he's convicted.  Right 
20110111032415.000|20110111032417.000|TR0|now, the picture of Jared Loughner's 
20110111032417.000|20110111032419.000|TR0|mental state appears troubling, to say the 
20110111032419.000|20110111032421.000|TR0|least.  After failing entrance into the 
20110111032421.000|20110111032424.000|TR0|Army, those who knew him at a local 
20110111032424.000|20110111032426.000|TR0|community college say his behavior turned 
20110111032426.000|20110111032428.000|TR0|bizarre.

20110111032451.000|20110111032453.000|TR0|first day of class, math teacher Ben 
20110111032453.000|20110111032455.000|TR0|McGahee knew there was something wrong 
20110111032455.000|20110111032457.000|TR0|with the student in classroom 209, a 
20110111032457.000|20110111032500.000|TR0|student named Jared Loughner, who had 
20110111032500.000|20110111032502.000|TR0|first become a disturbance, sudden 
20110111032502.000|20110111032504.000|TR0|outbursts, challenging his teaching, then 
20110111032504.000|20110111032506.000|TR0|going silent and ignoring everyone while 
20110111032506.000|20110111032508.000|TR0|listening to his iPod.  The behavior, the 
20110111032508.000|20110111032510.000|TR0|professor thought, was threatening.

20110111032527.000|20110111032529.000|TR0|they could come back and try to, you know,

20110111032732.000|20110111032734.000|TR0|to buy ammunition at this Wal-Mart store, 
20110111032734.000|20110111032736.000|TR0|abruptly left, and made the purchase 
20110111032736.000|20110111032738.000|TR0|somewhere else.

20110111032747.000|20110111032749.000|TR0|persist about how and whether Jared

20110111032751.000|20110111032753.000|TR0|the mayhem.

20110111032804.000|20110111032806.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, that is one of the many 
20110111032806.000|20110111032808.000|TR0|questions tonight.

20110111032810.000|20110111032812.000|TR0|Joining us now, two former classmates of

20110111032819.000|20110111032821.000|TR0|Steven, when did you first meet Jared?
20110111032821.000|20110111032823.000|TR0|
20110111032823.000|20110111032825.000|TR0|STEVEN CATES, FORMER CLASSMATE OF JARED 
20110111032825.000|20110111032827.000|TR0|LEE LOUGHNER:  In January of 2010, at the 
20110111032827.000|20110111032829.000|TR0|beginning of the poetry class.
20110111032829.000|20110111032831.000|TR0|
20110111032831.000|20110111032833.000|TR0|COOPER:  And what was your first 
20110111032833.000|20110111032836.000|TR0|impression of him?
20110111032836.000|20110111032838.000|TR0|
20110111032838.000|20110111032840.000|TR0|CATES:  He -- he was definitely off.  And 
20110111032840.000|20110111032842.000|TR0|-- and that was definitely something that 
20110111032842.000|20110111032844.000|TR0|was apparent as soon as -- as soon as I 
20110111032844.000|20110111032846.000|TR0|met him.  He had -- he had a grin about 
20110111032846.000|20110111032848.000|TR0|him, and he would clench his fists a lot.  
20110111032848.000|20110111032850.000|TR0|And -- and that -- that -- that was 
20110111032850.000|20110111032853.000|TR0|something that definitely made him appear 
20110111032853.000|20110111032855.000|TR0|off.
20110111032855.000|20110111032857.000|TR0|
20110111032857.000|20110111032859.000|TR0|COOPER:  And, Don, you sat two seats in 
20110111032859.000|20110111032901.000|TR0|front of Loughner in the same poetry 
20110111032901.000|20110111032903.000|TR0|class.  What struck you about him?
20110111032903.000|20110111032905.000|TR0|
20110111032905.000|20110111032907.000|TR0|DON COOROUGH, FORMER CLASSMATE OF JARED 
20110111032907.000|20110111032909.000|TR0|LEE LOUGHNER:  The first time I was really 
20110111032909.000|20110111032912.000|TR0|struck by him was because he used 
20110111032912.000|20110111032914.000|TR0|inappropriate reactions to people's 
20110111032914.000|20110111032916.000|TR0|emotional content.  He would laugh at 
20110111032916.000|20110111032918.000|TR0|things that were sad.  He just didn't seem 
20110111032918.000|20110111032920.000|TR0|to -- to be aware of what was going on.
20110111032920.000|20110111032922.000|TR0|
20110111032922.000|20110111032924.000|TR0|COOPER:  Steven, you actually -- you made 
20110111032924.000|20110111032926.000|TR0|an effort to -- to befriend him, right?
20110111032926.000|20110111032929.000|TR0|
20110111032929.000|20110111032931.000|TR0|CATES:  Not -- I made an effort to talk to 
20110111032931.000|20110111032933.000|TR0|him and to reach out to him and -- and 
20110111032933.000|20110111032935.000|TR0|show him that he wasn't completely 
20110111032935.000|20110111032937.000|TR0|isolated.
20110111032937.000|20110111032939.000|TR0|
20110111032939.000|20110111032941.000|TR0|COOPER:  What was your thinking in there?
20110111032941.000|20110111032943.000|TR0|
20110111032943.000|20110111032945.000|TR0|CATES:  Well, I -- I grew up in a small 
20110111032945.000|20110111032948.000|TR0|town, and -- and this doesn't usually work 
20110111032948.000|20110111032950.000|TR0|in small towns.  And so I knew what it 
20110111032950.000|20110111032952.000|TR0|felt like to be isolated and ostracized 
20110111032952.000|20110111032954.000|TR0|from -- from my peers.  And -- and I 
20110111032954.000|20110111032956.000|TR0|didn't want him to have to feel that in a 
20110111032956.000|20110111032958.000|TR0|poetry class.
20110111032958.000|20110111033000.000|TR0|
20110111033000.000|20110111033002.000|TR0|COOPER:  Was he able to make a connection 
20110111033002.000|20110111033005.000|TR0|with you?  I mean, were -- did he talk to 
20110111033005.000|20110111033007.000|TR0|you?
20110111033007.000|20110111033009.000|TR0|
20110111033009.000|20110111033011.000|TR0|CATES:  Yes.  I mean, I sat directly 
20110111033011.000|20110111033013.000|TR0|behind him.  He would -- he would turn 
20110111033013.000|20110111033015.000|TR0|around and talk to me occasionally in 
20110111033015.000|20110111033017.000|TR0|class.  When I -- when I would come into 
20110111033017.000|20110111033019.000|TR0|class, if he was already in there, I would 
20110111033019.000|20110111033021.000|TR0|give him a high-five before I sat down.
20110111033021.000|20110111033024.000|TR0|
20110111033024.000|20110111033026.000|TR0|COOPER:  But in terms of, like, real 
20110111033026.000|20110111033028.000|TR0|discussions and stuff, you never really 
20110111033028.000|20110111033030.000|TR0|developed that kind of a relationship?
20110111033030.000|20110111033032.000|TR0|
20110111033032.000|20110111033034.000|TR0|CATES:  No.  I -- I -- we never really 
20110111033034.000|20110111033036.000|TR0|made it to the -- the stage of being 
20110111033036.000|20110111033038.000|TR0|friends.  Most -- you know, any 
20110111033038.000|20110111033041.000|TR0|discussions that we had were usually 
20110111033041.000|20110111033043.000|TR0|pretty mundane.
20110111033043.000|20110111033045.000|TR0|
20110111033045.000|20110111033047.000|TR0|COOPER:  Did -- were you afraid of him in 
20110111033047.000|20110111033049.000|TR0|any way?
20110111033049.000|20110111033051.000|TR0|
20110111033051.000|20110111033053.000|TR0|CATES:  No, not really.  I -- I didn't -- 
20110111033053.000|20110111033055.000|TR0|no, I didn't feel afraid when I was around 
20110111033055.000|20110111033057.000|TR0|him.
20110111033057.000|20110111033100.000|TR0|
20110111033100.000|20110111033102.000|TR0|COOPER:  And there were lots -- there were 
20110111033102.000|20110111033104.000|TR0|complaints about him, right?
20110111033104.000|20110111033106.000|TR0|
20110111033106.000|20110111033108.000|TR0|CATES:  Yes.
20110111033108.000|20110111033110.000|TR0|
20110111033110.000|20110111033112.000|TR0|COOPER:  And did -- did anything happen 
20110111033112.000|20110111033114.000|TR0|after the complaint?
20110111033114.000|20110111033117.000|TR0|
20110111033117.000|20110111033119.000|TR0|CATES:  I don't -- I don't remember if he 
20110111033119.000|20110111033121.000|TR0|was actually removed from the class or if 
20110111033121.000|20110111033123.000|TR0|he just stopped showing up.  I -- because 
20110111033123.000|20110111033125.000|TR0|I don't remember him being there nearly as 
20110111033125.000|20110111033127.000|TR0|much toward the end of the semester.
20110111033127.000|20110111033129.000|TR0|
20110111033129.000|20110111033131.000|TR0|COOPER:  Don, did -- did -- did Loughner 
20110111033131.000|20110111033133.000|TR0|do anything or say anything that made you 
20110111033133.000|20110111033136.000|TR0|concerned about your safety or about what 
20110111033136.000|20110111033138.000|TR0|he may do?
20110111033138.000|20110111033140.000|TR0|
20110111033140.000|20110111033142.000|TR0|COOROUGH:  I was never afraid for my 
20110111033142.000|20110111033144.000|TR0|safety, no.
20110111033144.000|20110111033146.000|TR0|
20110111033146.000|20110111033148.000|TR0|But if I can jump on what Steven just 
20110111033148.000|20110111033150.000|TR0|said, I had a conversation with the 
20110111033150.000|20110111033153.000|TR0|professor about just the class in general 
20110111033153.000|20110111033155.000|TR0|at the -- at the end of the year.  And Dr. 
20110111033155.000|20110111033157.000|TR0|Samoni (ph) did indicate to me that he did 
20110111033157.000|20110111033159.000|TR0|have him removed from the class.  And it 
20110111033159.000|20110111033201.000|TR0|was because of complaints from a variety 
20110111033201.000|20110111033203.000|TR0|of students.  They -- some of them 
20110111033203.000|20110111033205.000|TR0|apparently felt uncomfortable and didn't 
20110111033205.000|20110111033207.000|TR0|-- didn't like his presence in the 
20110111033207.000|20110111033209.000|TR0|classroom. So, he was asked to be removed 
20110111033209.000|20110111033212.000|TR0|from the class.
20110111033212.000|20110111033214.000|TR0|
20110111033214.000|20110111033216.000|TR0|COOPER:  And, Steven, after he left 
20110111033216.000|20110111033218.000|TR0|school, did you ever see him again?
20110111033218.000|20110111033220.000|TR0|
20110111033220.000|20110111033222.000|TR0|CATES:  I did not.  I -- I actually didn't 
20110111033222.000|20110111033224.000|TR0|see him after the semester was over, 
20110111033224.000|20110111033226.000|TR0|before he was removed from Pima.
20110111033226.000|20110111033229.000|TR0|
20110111033229.000|20110111033231.000|TR0|COOPER:  I don't know if you have gotten a 
20110111033231.000|20110111033233.000|TR0|look at the mug shot, Steven, from today, 
20110111033233.000|20110111033235.000|TR0|but his head is shaved and stuff.  If you 
20110111033235.000|20110111033237.000|TR0|have seen it, what -- how does it compare 
20110111033237.000|20110111033239.000|TR0|to the guy you know?
20110111033239.000|20110111033241.000|TR0|
20110111033241.000|20110111033243.000|TR0|CATES:  His -- he -- when I knew him, he 
20110111033243.000|20110111033245.000|TR0|had just a buzzed head, as opposed to a 
20110111033245.000|20110111033248.000|TR0|shaved head, but that -- that same -- that 
20110111033248.000|20110111033250.000|TR0|same look was the look that made people in 
20110111033250.000|20110111033252.000|TR0|class uncomfortable.

20110111033258.000|20110111033300.000|TR0|shot?

20110111033302.000|20110111033305.000|TR0|COOROUGH:  Yes, it is.  I agree with 
20110111033305.000|20110111033307.000|TR0|Steven very -- very much on that.  It's 
20110111033307.000|20110111033309.000|TR0|exactly correct.
20110111033309.000|20110111033311.000|TR0|
20110111033311.000|20110111033313.000|TR0|COOPER:  That same look?
20110111033313.000|20110111033315.000|TR0|
20110111033315.000|20110111033317.000|TR0|COOROUGH:  Yes.
20110111033317.000|20110111033319.000|TR0|
20110111033319.000|20110111033321.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, Don, it seems...
20110111033321.000|20110111033324.000|TR0|
20110111033324.000|20110111033326.000|TR0|COOROUGH:  He had that look.
20110111033326.000|20110111033328.000|TR0|
20110111033328.000|20110111033330.000|TR0|COOPER:  He had that look?
20110111033330.000|20110111033332.000|TR0|
20110111033332.000|20110111033334.000|TR0|COOROUGH:  Mm-hmm.  Yes.
20110111033334.000|20110111033336.000|TR0|
20110111033336.000|20110111033338.000|TR0|COOPER:  Don Coorough, Steven Cates, I 
20110111033338.000|20110111033341.000|TR0|appreciate you taking time to talk with 
20110111033341.000|20110111033343.000|TR0|us.  Thank you.
20110111033343.000|20110111033345.000|TR0|
20110111033345.000|20110111033347.000|TR0|CATES:  Not a problem.
20110111033347.000|20110111033349.000|TR0|
20110111033349.000|20110111033351.000|TR0|COOROUGH:  You're welcome.
20110111033351.000|20110111033353.000|TR0|
20110111033353.000|20110111033355.000|TR0|COOPER:  Still ahead, we're going to hear 
20110111033355.000|20110111033357.000|TR0|from the parents of Christina Taylor 
20110111033357.000|20110111033400.000|TR0|Green, the youngest victim in the Tucson 
20110111033400.000|20110111033402.000|TR0|shootings. She was just 9 years old.  She 
20110111033402.000|20110111033404.000|TR0|was at the Safeway store on Saturday, not 
20110111033404.000|20110111033406.000|TR0|by chance, but because of her deep 
20110111033406.000|20110111033408.000|TR0|interest in government at the age of 9.  
20110111033408.000|20110111033410.000|TR0|Imagine that.
20110111033410.000|20110111033412.000|TR0|
20110111033412.000|20110111033414.000|TR0|Plus, in these critical hours for 
20110111033414.000|20110111033417.000|TR0|Representative Giffords, 360 M.D. Sanjay 
20110111033417.000|20110111033419.000|TR0|Gupta is going to explain how she survived 
20110111033419.000|20110111033421.000|TR0|the seemingly impossible.  I mean, you 
20110111033421.000|20110111033423.000|TR0|heard from one of the witnesses she was 
20110111033423.000|20110111033425.000|TR0|shot just from a few feet away, not even 
20110111033425.000|20110111033427.000|TR0|seeing the gunman.  A bullet went through 
20110111033427.000|20110111033429.000|TR0|her head, entering from the rear.
20110111033429.000|20110111033431.000|TR0|
20110111033431.000|20110111033433.000|TR0|We're going to take your text questions to 
20110111033433.000|20110111033436.000|TR0|them at 22360 or AC360.

20110111033444.000|20110111033446.000|TR0|
20110111033446.000|20110111033448.000|TR0|COOPER:  You're looking at a live picture 
20110111033448.000|20110111033450.000|TR0|of the makeshift memorial that has 
20110111033450.000|20110111033453.000|TR0|spontaneously been put up outside the 
20110111033453.000|20110111033455.000|TR0|hospital where Congresswoman Giffords now 
20110111033455.000|20110111033457.000|TR0|still lies in critical condition.  We'll 
20110111033457.000|20110111033459.000|TR0|bring you the latest from Arizona tonight.
20110111033459.000|20110111033501.000|TR0|
20110111033501.000|20110111033503.000|TR0|It's been almost 60 hours since 
20110111033503.000|20110111033505.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords was shot in the 
20110111033505.000|20110111033507.000|TR0|head at point-blank range.  Incredible she 
20110111033507.000|20110111033509.000|TR0|even survived. According to her doctors at 
20110111033509.000|20110111033512.000|TR0|the University of Tucson Medical Center, 
20110111033512.000|20110111033514.000|TR0|these next hours will be critical.  In a 
20110111033514.000|20110111033516.000|TR0|news conference today, they said that 
20110111033516.000|20110111033518.000|TR0|Giffords' condition is unchanged.  No 
20110111033518.000|20110111033520.000|TR0|change, they point out, is actually good 
20110111033520.000|20110111033522.000|TR0|news.
20110111033522.000|20110111033524.000|TR0|
20110111033524.000|20110111033526.000|TR0|We've also learned more about where and 
20110111033526.000|20110111033529.000|TR0|how the bullet struck her, details that 
20110111033529.000|20110111033531.000|TR0|could work in her favor.  360 M.D. and 
20110111033531.000|20110111033533.000|TR0|practicing neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta 
20110111033533.000|20110111033535.000|TR0|joins me now.
20110111033535.000|20110111033537.000|TR0|
20110111033537.000|20110111033539.000|TR0|I was amazed to hear earlier from one of 
20110111033539.000|20110111033541.000|TR0|our guests that, you know, the close range 
20110111033541.000|20110111033543.000|TR0|at which she was shot, and she was facing 
20110111033543.000|20110111033545.000|TR0|away from the gunman so the bullet passed 
20110111033545.000|20110111033548.000|TR0|from the rear of her skull out to the 
20110111033548.000|20110111033550.000|TR0|front.  That's actually better than if it 
20110111033550.000|20110111033552.000|TR0|had passed from the side, correct?
20110111033552.000|20110111033554.000|TR0|
20110111033554.000|20110111033556.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. 
20110111033556.000|20110111033558.000|TR0| One of the things when you're looking at 
20110111033558.000|20110111033600.000|TR0|a patient like this, there's several 
20110111033600.000|20110111033602.000|TR0|crucial decisions that surgeons want to 
20110111033602.000|20110111033605.000|TR0|make immediately.  One of them is to look 
20110111033605.000|20110111033607.000|TR0|and see how the patient is doing in terms 
20110111033607.000|20110111033609.000|TR0|of blood pressure, heart rate.  Another 
20110111033609.000|20110111033611.000|TR0|one is in terms of a neurological exam.
20110111033611.000|20110111033613.000|TR0|
20110111033613.000|20110111033615.000|TR0|But you're exactly right, Anderson.  What 
20110111033615.000|20110111033617.000|TR0|we know is that bullets that actually pass 
20110111033617.000|20110111033619.000|TR0|from across the midline, we call it -- let 
20110111033619.000|20110111033622.000|TR0|me show you really quick.  If you're 
20110111033622.000|20110111033624.000|TR0|looking at a skull here, sort of going all 
20110111033624.000|20110111033626.000|TR0|the way from the right to the left, or 
20110111033626.000|20110111033628.000|TR0|from the left to the right, that tends to 
20110111033628.000|20110111033630.000|TR0|be a big problem, because so much of the 
20110111033630.000|20110111033632.000|TR0|structures that control a person's ability 
20110111033632.000|20110111033634.000|TR0|to control their own heart rate, their 
20110111033634.000|20110111033636.000|TR0|respirations, all that sort of stuff, 
20110111033636.000|20110111033638.000|TR0|that's sort of in that midline area.  And 
20110111033638.000|20110111033641.000|TR0|that's what's so important.
20110111033641.000|20110111033643.000|TR0|
20110111033643.000|20110111033645.000|TR0|So if it stays on one side of the brain, 
20110111033645.000|20110111033647.000|TR0|the left or the right, the chances of 
20110111033647.000|20110111033649.000|TR0|surviving that are much, much higher, 
20110111033649.000|20110111033651.000|TR0|Anderson.
20110111033651.000|20110111033653.000|TR0|
20110111033653.000|20110111033655.000|TR0|COOPER:  And we're told she's in a 
20110111033655.000|20110111033658.000|TR0|medically-induced coma. They've removed an 
20110111033658.000|20110111033700.000|TR0|area of her skull.  That's to reduce 
20110111033700.000|20110111033702.000|TR0|swelling, correct?
20110111033702.000|20110111033704.000|TR0|
20110111033704.000|20110111033706.000|TR0|GUPTA:  That's right.  You have to almost 
20110111033706.000|20110111033708.000|TR0|anticipate that there's going to be 
20110111033708.000|20110111033710.000|TR0|swelling here.  You know, any time you 
20110111033710.000|20110111033712.000|TR0|have an injury to the brain like this, you 
20110111033712.000|20110111033714.000|TR0|anticipate that.
20110111033714.000|20110111033717.000|TR0|
20110111033717.000|20110111033719.000|TR0|The thing with the brain is, unlike other 
20110111033719.000|20110111033721.000|TR0|organs in the body, organs in your 
20110111033721.000|20110111033723.000|TR0|abdomen, for example, if you have swelling 
20110111033723.000|20110111033725.000|TR0|in those organs, you have room for them to 
20110111033725.000|20110111033727.000|TR0|swell.  In the brain, you don't. And the 
20110111033727.000|20110111033729.000|TR0|only place it can go down and that can be 
20110111033729.000|20110111033731.000|TR0|a catastrophic problem.  So you want to 
20110111033731.000|20110111033734.000|TR0|provide some room this way.
20110111033734.000|20110111033736.000|TR0|
20110111033736.000|20110111033738.000|TR0|What is also interesting, Anderson, this 
20110111033738.000|20110111033740.000|TR0|was a through-and- through injury, or a in 
20110111033740.000|20110111033742.000|TR0|and out injury of the skull.  The type of 
20110111033742.000|20110111033744.000|TR0|bullet, a 9 millimeter bullet, a lot has 
20110111033744.000|20110111033746.000|TR0|been made of that.  We don't know the 
20110111033746.000|20110111033748.000|TR0|specific ballistics of it, but the fact 
20110111033748.000|20110111033750.000|TR0|that this bullet went through and through 
20110111033750.000|20110111033753.000|TR0|the brain, through the skull and through 
20110111033753.000|20110111033755.000|TR0|the brain in the end was probably also a 
20110111033755.000|20110111033757.000|TR0|good thing, because so much of the energy, 
20110111033757.000|20110111033759.000|TR0|instead of staying in the intercranial 
20110111033759.000|20110111033801.000|TR0|cavity, sort of moves out and sort of 
20110111033801.000|20110111033803.000|TR0|dissipated into space instead.  That -- I 
20110111033803.000|20110111033805.000|TR0|think that's an important point, and it 
20110111033805.000|20110111033807.000|TR0|was a good sign and an important sign for 
20110111033807.000|20110111033810.000|TR0|her.       COOPER:  We got a "Text 360" 
20110111033810.000|20110111033812.000|TR0|question.  It comes from someone named 
20110111033812.000|20110111033814.000|TR0|Onamber in Michigan.  They ask, "How much 
20110111033814.000|20110111033816.000|TR0|normal function will Representative 
20110111033816.000|20110111033818.000|TR0|Giffords regain in recovery?"  Can we know 
20110111033818.000|20110111033820.000|TR0|that at this point?  Probably not.
20110111033820.000|20110111033822.000|TR0|
20110111033822.000|20110111033824.000|TR0|GUPTA:  I think we can't know, and I think 
20110111033824.000|20110111033826.000|TR0|that probably no -- none of the doctors 
20110111033826.000|20110111033829.000|TR0|are going to comment on that.  Probably 
20110111033829.000|20110111033831.000|TR0|should not be commenting, but I will tell 
20110111033831.000|20110111033833.000|TR0|you, when you think about the left side of 
20110111033833.000|20110111033835.000|TR0|the brain, a couple of things to keep in 
20110111033835.000|20110111033837.000|TR0|mind.
20110111033837.000|20110111033839.000|TR0|
20110111033839.000|20110111033841.000|TR0|One is that the -- the -- in most people, 
20110111033841.000|20110111033843.000|TR0|speech is located in this part of the 
20110111033843.000|20110111033846.000|TR0|brain.  And when we say "speech," that's 
20110111033846.000|20110111033848.000|TR0|sort of an umbrella term for all forms of 
20110111033848.000|20110111033850.000|TR0|communication.  Your ability to express 
20110111033850.000|20110111033852.000|TR0|yourself, both in written and spoken 
20110111033852.000|20110111033854.000|TR0|words.  But also, to receive 
20110111033854.000|20110111033856.000|TR0|communication, to be able to understand 
20110111033856.000|20110111033858.000|TR0|somebody.  So this is a very -- obviously, 
20110111033858.000|20110111033900.000|TR0|a very important part of who somebody is.
20110111033900.000|20110111033902.000|TR0|
20110111033902.000|20110111033905.000|TR0|Also, the strength on the right side of 
20110111033905.000|20110111033907.000|TR0|the body is controlled by the left side of 
20110111033907.000|20110111033909.000|TR0|the brain.  So that's something else I'm 
20110111033909.000|20110111033911.000|TR0|sure doctors are going to monitor very 
20110111033911.000|20110111033913.000|TR0|carefully.  Tough to evaluate that fully 
20110111033913.000|20110111033915.000|TR0|now, obviously, when someone's in critical 
20110111033915.000|20110111033917.000|TR0|condition.
20110111033917.000|20110111033919.000|TR0|
20110111033919.000|20110111033922.000|TR0|Also, Anderson, you pointed out, the 
20110111033922.000|20110111033924.000|TR0|trajectory of this coming up in the front 
20110111033924.000|20110111033926.000|TR0|area.  Exit wounds can tend to be larger 
20110111033926.000|20110111033928.000|TR0|than the entrance wounds, as well.  And 
20110111033928.000|20110111033930.000|TR0|you know, could that have affected her 
20110111033930.000|20110111033932.000|TR0|vision?  Possibly, as well.  So a couple 
20110111033932.000|20110111033934.000|TR0|of things I'm sure that they're going to 
20110111033934.000|20110111033936.000|TR0|be looking for.
20110111033936.000|20110111033938.000|TR0|
20110111033938.000|20110111033941.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes.  Well, certainly, our 
20110111033941.000|20110111033943.000|TR0|thoughts are with her family tonight.  
20110111033943.000|20110111033945.000|TR0|Sanjay, appreciate that.
20110111033945.000|20110111033947.000|TR0|
20110111033947.000|20110111033949.000|TR0|The youngest victim.  You know, we talked 
20110111033949.000|20110111033951.000|TR0|at the beginning of the program about not 
20110111033951.000|20110111033953.000|TR0|just focusing on the shooter, as so often 
20110111033953.000|20110111033955.000|TR0|happens in a case like this, but really 
20110111033955.000|20110111033958.000|TR0|honoring and remembering the victims. 
20110111033958.000|20110111034000.000|TR0|Learning their names.  Learning their 
20110111034000.000|20110111034002.000|TR0|stories.
20110111034002.000|20110111034004.000|TR0|
20110111034004.000|20110111034006.000|TR0|The youngest victim is this little girl, 
20110111034006.000|20110111034008.000|TR0|Christina Taylor Green. You probably heard 
20110111034008.000|20110111034010.000|TR0|her name by now.  She was just 9 years 
20110111034010.000|20110111034012.000|TR0|old, the granddaughter of former Major 
20110111034012.000|20110111034014.000|TR0|League manager and pitcher Dallas Green.
20110111034014.000|20110111034017.000|TR0|
20110111034017.000|20110111034019.000|TR0|Christina was a 9/11 baby.  She came into 
20110111034019.000|20110111034021.000|TR0|the world the same day the three planes 
20110111034021.000|20110111034023.000|TR0|hit the World Trade Center and the 
20110111034023.000|20110111034025.000|TR0|Pentagon.  The national tragedy reportedly 
20110111034025.000|20110111034027.000|TR0|shaped her patriotism as she grew older. 
20110111034027.000|20110111034029.000|TR0|Christina was in third grade and was 
20110111034029.000|20110111034031.000|TR0|recently elected to her school's student 
20110111034031.000|20110111034034.000|TR0|council.  She was interested in 
20110111034034.000|20110111034036.000|TR0|government, and that's why she went to the 
20110111034036.000|20110111034038.000|TR0|Safeway in Tucson on Saturday to meet 
20110111034038.000|20110111034040.000|TR0|Representative Giffords.
20110111034040.000|20110111034042.000|TR0|
20110111034042.000|20110111034044.000|TR0|I spoke earlier with her Christina's 
20110111034044.000|20110111034046.000|TR0|parents, John and Roxanna Green.

20110111034053.000|20110111034055.000|TR0|COOPER:  John and Roxanna, I just want to 
20110111034055.000|20110111034057.000|TR0|start by saying how sorry I am, obviously 
20110111034057.000|20110111034059.000|TR0|for your loss.  How are -- how are you 
20110111034059.000|20110111034101.000|TR0|guys holding up, John?      JOHN GREEN, 
20110111034101.000|20110111034103.000|TR0|FATHER OF CHRISTINA:  It's been difficult. 
20110111034103.000|20110111034105.000|TR0| As my wife said today, we didn't feel 
20110111034105.000|20110111034107.000|TR0|like we would be picking out caskets at 9 
20110111034107.000|20110111034110.000|TR0|years old, and we had to do that today.
20110111034110.000|20110111034112.000|TR0|
20110111034112.000|20110111034114.000|TR0|But you know, my wife's been amazing.  My 
20110111034114.000|20110111034116.000|TR0|son and my family and the support we've 
20110111034116.000|20110111034118.000|TR0|gotten from the community and all our 
20110111034118.000|20110111034120.000|TR0|friends has been amazing.
20110111034120.000|20110111034122.000|TR0|
20110111034122.000|20110111034124.000|TR0|COOPER:  Roxanna, tell me about Christina? 
20110111034124.000|20110111034126.000|TR0| She seems like an incredibly special 
20110111034126.000|20110111034129.000|TR0|little girl.
20110111034129.000|20110111034131.000|TR0|
20110111034131.000|20110111034133.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  Christina Taylor was a 
20110111034133.000|20110111034135.000|TR0|wonderful girl.  She was the best daughter 
20110111034135.000|20110111034137.000|TR0|in the world.  She was a straight-A 
20110111034137.000|20110111034139.000|TR0|student.  She was a good athlete.  She was 
20110111034139.000|20110111034141.000|TR0|very concerned and with government, with 
20110111034141.000|20110111034143.000|TR0|learning ways that she could help the 
20110111034143.000|20110111034146.000|TR0|community.
20110111034146.000|20110111034148.000|TR0|
20110111034148.000|20110111034150.000|TR0|COOPER:  So she was interested in politics?
20110111034150.000|20110111034152.000|TR0|
20110111034152.000|20110111034154.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  I could go on and on.  She was 
20110111034154.000|20110111034156.000|TR0|a wonderful person. Yes, she was.
20110111034156.000|20110111034158.000|TR0|
20110111034158.000|20110111034200.000|TR0|COOPER:  At 9?  That's pretty remarkable.
20110111034200.000|20110111034202.000|TR0|
20110111034202.000|20110111034205.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  She got that from her 
20110111034205.000|20110111034207.000|TR0|grandmother and her mother. Both of them 
20110111034207.000|20110111034209.000|TR0|are politically minded and followed the 
20110111034209.000|20110111034211.000|TR0|presidential campaign with President Obama.
20110111034211.000|20110111034213.000|TR0|
20110111034213.000|20110111034215.000|TR0|COOPER:  John, can you take us through the 
20110111034215.000|20110111034217.000|TR0|events of Saturday morning?  I mean, when 
20110111034217.000|20110111034219.000|TR0|did you get word that something had 
20110111034219.000|20110111034222.000|TR0|happened.
20110111034222.000|20110111034224.000|TR0|
20110111034224.000|20110111034226.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  Roxanne had already gotten a 
20110111034226.000|20110111034228.000|TR0|phone call from Bill Halleman (ph), who is 
20110111034228.000|20110111034230.000|TR0|-- is our neighbor, and his wife, Suzy 
20110111034230.000|20110111034232.000|TR0|Halleman (ph).  They took my daughter to 
20110111034232.000|20110111034234.000|TR0|this Gabrielle Giffords meet-and-greet at 
20110111034234.000|20110111034236.000|TR0|the Safeway.  And so we didn't know 
20110111034236.000|20110111034238.000|TR0|anything -- Roxanne realized something was 
20110111034238.000|20110111034241.000|TR0|amiss.  And as I got up to the emergency 
20110111034241.000|20110111034243.000|TR0|room and saw my wife's face, I knew it 
20110111034243.000|20110111034245.000|TR0|wasn't good.
20110111034245.000|20110111034247.000|TR0|
20110111034247.000|20110111034249.000|TR0|And the surgeon sat down and gave me the 
20110111034249.000|20110111034251.000|TR0|same explanation that she had gotten and 
20110111034251.000|20110111034253.000|TR0|that Christina was -- she fought.  She 
20110111034253.000|20110111034255.000|TR0|fought -- she fought all the way, and she 
20110111034255.000|20110111034258.000|TR0|was still alive when she got to the 
20110111034258.000|20110111034300.000|TR0|hospital, but -- but she didn't make it.  
20110111034300.000|20110111034302.000|TR0|And they took us back with her.  And we 
20110111034302.000|20110111034304.000|TR0|all, my son and all of us, got a chance to 
20110111034304.000|20110111034306.000|TR0|say good-bye.
20110111034306.000|20110111034308.000|TR0|
20110111034308.000|20110111034310.000|TR0|COOPER:  Roxanna, how old is Dallas, your 
20110111034310.000|20110111034312.000|TR0|son?
20110111034312.000|20110111034314.000|TR0|
20110111034314.000|20110111034317.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  Dallas is 11 years old.  He's 
20110111034317.000|20110111034319.000|TR0|in fifth grade.
20110111034319.000|20110111034321.000|TR0|
20110111034321.000|20110111034323.000|TR0|COOPER:  So, I mean, when -- he was there 
20110111034323.000|20110111034325.000|TR0|with you when you got word.  Did he -- I 
20110111034325.000|20110111034327.000|TR0|mean, what did -- how did you explain to 
20110111034327.000|20110111034329.000|TR0|him what was going on?
20110111034329.000|20110111034331.000|TR0|
20110111034331.000|20110111034334.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  I don't think he really 
20110111034334.000|20110111034336.000|TR0|understood at first, because he came over 
20110111034336.000|20110111034338.000|TR0|to me and he said, "So, are we going to go 
20110111034338.000|20110111034340.000|TR0|see Christina now?"  I think he was just 
20110111034340.000|20110111034342.000|TR0|in shock or overwhelmed.  He didn't really 
20110111034342.000|20110111034344.000|TR0|understand.
20110111034344.000|20110111034346.000|TR0|
20110111034346.000|20110111034348.000|TR0|So I had to explain to him that Christina 
20110111034348.000|20110111034350.000|TR0|didn't make it, that she was shot in the 
20110111034350.000|20110111034353.000|TR0|chest.  And that she died and went to

20110111034357.000|20110111034359.000|TR0|COOPER:  What do you want her legacy to 
20110111034359.000|20110111034401.000|TR0|be?  I mean, it's a strange question to 
20110111034401.000|20110111034403.000|TR0|ask, but what do you want people to know 
20110111034403.000|20110111034405.000|TR0|about her?
20110111034405.000|20110111034407.000|TR0|
20110111034407.000|20110111034410.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  I just want people to know that 
20110111034410.000|20110111034412.000|TR0|she was a fearless, brave, courageous, 
20110111034412.000|20110111034414.000|TR0|intelligent little girl.  That she had an 
20110111034414.000|20110111034416.000|TR0|amazing nine years on this earth.  She did 
20110111034416.000|20110111034418.000|TR0|things and wanted to do things that most 
20110111034418.000|20110111034420.000|TR0|people never even dream about.
20110111034420.000|20110111034422.000|TR0|
20110111034422.000|20110111034424.000|TR0|I hope that she'll always be -- people 
20110111034424.000|20110111034426.000|TR0|will look for hope or change for peace.  
20110111034426.000|20110111034429.000|TR0|And that's what Christina would want.  She 
20110111034429.000|20110111034431.000|TR0|wouldn't want us to be sad.  She was would 
20110111034431.000|20110111034433.000|TR0|be just like, let's do something. Let's 
20110111034433.000|20110111034435.000|TR0|make this never, ever happen again so no 
20110111034435.000|20110111034437.000|TR0|one else has to get hurt.
20110111034437.000|20110111034439.000|TR0|
20110111034439.000|20110111034441.000|TR0|COOPER:  John, you know there's obviously 
20110111034441.000|20110111034443.000|TR0|a lot of finger- pointing going on.  
20110111034443.000|20110111034446.000|TR0|People are talking about politics, about 
20110111034446.000|20110111034448.000|TR0|the heated rhetoric.  Does any of that 
20110111034448.000|20110111034450.000|TR0|resonate with you, or do you think that's 
20110111034450.000|20110111034452.000|TR0|inappropriate?
20110111034452.000|20110111034454.000|TR0|
20110111034454.000|20110111034456.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  I don't think -- I don't think 
20110111034456.000|20110111034458.000|TR0|it's about politics. You know?  I think 
20110111034458.000|20110111034500.000|TR0|it's a random act of violence.  I think 
20110111034500.000|20110111034502.000|TR0|it's -- it's a way that -- you know, I 
20110111034502.000|20110111034505.000|TR0|think some of it is media-driven, to be 
20110111034505.000|20110111034507.000|TR0|honest with you.  Because people have 
20110111034507.000|20110111034509.000|TR0|begun to learn that they can solve some of 
20110111034509.000|20110111034511.000|TR0|their problems and make a big splash.
20110111034511.000|20110111034513.000|TR0|
20110111034513.000|20110111034515.000|TR0|I don't want to politicize this thing.  I 
20110111034515.000|20110111034517.000|TR0|-- you know, I want to remember, you know, 
20110111034517.000|20110111034519.000|TR0|our daughter.  I want the country to 
20110111034519.000|20110111034522.000|TR0|remember our daughter.  I believe she 
20110111034522.000|20110111034524.000|TR0|would have been a great patriot and a 
20110111034524.000|20110111034526.000|TR0|great American.
20110111034526.000|20110111034528.000|TR0|
20110111034528.000|20110111034530.000|TR0|My fear is that people forget, and I don't 
20110111034530.000|20110111034532.000|TR0|want people to forget her.  We know we 
20110111034532.000|20110111034534.000|TR0|never will, and people that have come into 
20110111034534.000|20110111034536.000|TR0|contact with her, they will never forget 
20110111034536.000|20110111034538.000|TR0|her.
20110111034538.000|20110111034541.000|TR0|
20110111034541.000|20110111034543.000|TR0|I just want to point out the other thing.  
20110111034543.000|20110111034545.000|TR0|President Obama called last night, and 
20110111034545.000|20110111034547.000|TR0|Roxanna, who is a huge fan of President 
20110111034547.000|20110111034549.000|TR0|Obama, and my son, and he talked to me, 
20110111034549.000|20110111034551.000|TR0|but my son was thrilled to talk to the 
20110111034551.000|20110111034553.000|TR0|president.  And that showed a lot about 
20110111034553.000|20110111034555.000|TR0|our president.
20110111034555.000|20110111034558.000|TR0|
20110111034558.000|20110111034600.000|TR0|COOPER:  Roxanna, what did he say to you?
20110111034600.000|20110111034602.000|TR0|
20110111034602.000|20110111034604.000|TR0|R. GREEN:  He just wanted to express his 
20110111034604.000|20110111034606.000|TR0|deepest sympathies and condolences and 
20110111034606.000|20110111034608.000|TR0|said that -- he was positive and said, 
20110111034608.000|20110111034610.000|TR0|"You're going to get through this.  We'll 
20110111034610.000|20110111034612.000|TR0|all be here for you."  And it was just -- 
20110111034612.000|20110111034614.000|TR0|it was amazing.  It was one of the best 
20110111034614.000|20110111034617.000|TR0|conversations or phone calls I've ever got.
20110111034617.000|20110111034619.000|TR0|
20110111034619.000|20110111034621.000|TR0|COOPER:  I want to thank you.  I hope you 
20110111034621.000|20110111034623.000|TR0|both stay strong and -- as you have been 
20110111034623.000|20110111034625.000|TR0|and, again, thanks for coming on and 
20110111034625.000|20110111034627.000|TR0|telling us about Christina.
20110111034627.000|20110111034629.000|TR0|
20110111034629.000|20110111034631.000|TR0|J. GREEN:  Thank you very much, Anderson.

20110111034638.000|20110111034640.000|TR0|COOPER:  Incredibly strong.
20110111034640.000|20110111034642.000|TR0|
20110111034642.000|20110111034644.000|TR0|You heard the greens address the issue, 
20110111034644.000|20110111034646.000|TR0|the calls to tone down the political 
20110111034646.000|20110111034648.000|TR0|rhetoric once and for all.  But even in 
20110111034648.000|20110111034650.000|TR0|the days since the shooting, a lot of 
20110111034650.000|20110111034653.000|TR0|finger-pointing on both sides.  Democrats 
20110111034653.000|20110111034655.000|TR0|saying Republicans are to blame for the 
20110111034655.000|20110111034657.000|TR0|climate of heated rhetoric, Republicans 
20110111034657.000|20110111034659.000|TR0|saying Democrats are polarizing the 
20110111034659.000|20110111034701.000|TR0|shooting.  The local sheriff, a Democrat, 
20110111034701.000|20110111034703.000|TR0|weighed in.  Coming up, a look into 
20110111034703.000|20110111034705.000|TR0|whether the talk had become downright 
20110111034705.000|20110111034707.000|TR0|toxic or if that had nothing to do with 
20110111034707.000|20110111034710.000|TR0|this.
20110111034710.000|20110111034712.000|TR0|

20110111034716.000|20110111034718.000|TR0|COOPER:  In the days since the shooting 
20110111034718.000|20110111034720.000|TR0|there's been all kinds of finger-pointing 
20110111034720.000|20110111034722.000|TR0|about who's to blame for this tragedy, 
20110111034722.000|20110111034724.000|TR0|beyond the shooter himself.  Even amid 
20110111034724.000|20110111034726.000|TR0|calls to tone down the rhetoric, it seems 
20110111034726.000|20110111034729.000|TR0|to be ratcheting up.  Some Democrats are 
20110111034729.000|20110111034731.000|TR0|going to be using the situation to point 
20110111034731.000|20110111034733.000|TR0|fingers at Republicans, accusing them of 
20110111034733.000|20110111034735.000|TR0|creating a toxic environment of 
20110111034735.000|20110111034737.000|TR0|inflammatory political speech, while 
20110111034737.000|20110111034739.000|TR0|conservative radio is blowing up with 
20110111034739.000|20110111034741.000|TR0|accusations that it's actually Democrats 
20110111034741.000|20110111034743.000|TR0|who are politicizing the shooting.
20110111034743.000|20110111034746.000|TR0|
20110111034746.000|20110111034748.000|TR0|Of course, we should keep in mind that 
20110111034748.000|20110111034750.000|TR0|there's been nothing to clearly link the 
20110111034750.000|20110111034752.000|TR0|shooter to any of this rhetoric.  He has 
20110111034752.000|20110111034754.000|TR0|some Internet ramblings about currency and 
20110111034754.000|20110111034756.000|TR0|the gold standard , and he was a 
20110111034756.000|20110111034758.000|TR0|registered independent, but some who knew 
20110111034758.000|20110111034800.000|TR0|him say he was more interested in 
20110111034800.000|20110111034803.000|TR0|philosophical discussions than political 
20110111034803.000|20110111034805.000|TR0|ones.
20110111034805.000|20110111034807.000|TR0|
20110111034807.000|20110111034809.000|TR0|In the last day or two, someone pointed to 
20110111034809.000|20110111034811.000|TR0|an image put out by Sarah Palin.  There's 
20110111034811.000|20110111034813.000|TR0|no evidence the alleged shooter knew 
20110111034813.000|20110111034815.000|TR0|anything about it.  While campaigning back 
20110111034815.000|20110111034817.000|TR0|in March, you'll remember Palin posted a 
20110111034817.000|20110111034819.000|TR0|map on Facebook, putting crosshairs over 
20110111034819.000|20110111034822.000|TR0|several Democratic- controlled districts 
20110111034822.000|20110111034824.000|TR0|including Giffords'.  At the same time 
20110111034824.000|20110111034826.000|TR0|Palin tweeted, quote, "Common-sense 
20110111034826.000|20110111034828.000|TR0|conservatives and lovers of America, don't 
20110111034828.000|20110111034830.000|TR0|-- don't retreat.  Instead, reload."

20110111034832.000|20110111034834.000|TR0|Representative Giffords actually took 
20110111034834.000|20110111034836.000|TR0|issue with Palin's imagery. Here's what 
20110111034836.000|20110111034839.000|TR0|she said on MSNBC back in March.

20110111034849.000|20110111034851.000|TR0|the thing is that the way that she has it 
20110111034851.000|20110111034853.000|TR0|depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight

20110111034925.000|20110111034927.000|TR0|violence isn't the answer.  When we take 
20110111034927.000|20110111034929.000|TR0|up our arms, we're talking about our vote. 
20110111034929.000|20110111034931.000|TR0| We're talking about being involved in a 
20110111034931.000|20110111034934.000|TR0|contested primary like this, and picking 
20110111034934.000|20110111034936.000|TR0|the right candidate, too, John McCain. We 
20110111034936.000|20110111034938.000|TR0|thank you for that.
20110111034938.000|20110111034940.000|TR0|
20110111034940.000|20110111034942.000|TR0|But this B.S. coming from the lamestream 
20110111034942.000|20110111034944.000|TR0|media lately about us -- about us inciting 
20110111034944.000|20110111034946.000|TR0|violence.  Don't let -- don't let the 
20110111034946.000|20110111034948.000|TR0|conversation be diverted.  Don't let a 
20110111034948.000|20110111034951.000|TR0|distraction like that get you off track.

20110111034957.000|20110111034959.000|TR0|COOPER:  Palin's echoing those statements 
20110111034959.000|20110111035001.000|TR0|today in an e-mail that Glenn Beck talked 
20110111035001.000|20110111035003.000|TR0|about on his radio show.  Palin says she 
20110111035003.000|20110111035005.000|TR0|hates violence, that, quote, "Our children 
20110111035005.000|20110111035007.000|TR0|will not have peace if politicos just 
20110111035007.000|20110111035010.000|TR0|capitalize on this."

20110111035014.000|20110111035016.000|TR0|weighed in on the night of the shooting.  
20110111035016.000|20110111035018.000|TR0|Democratic Pima County Sheriff Clarence 
20110111035018.000|20110111035020.000|TR0|Dupnik talked about tone and how it can 
20110111035020.000|20110111035022.000|TR0|have deadly consequences.

20110111035029.000|20110111035031.000|TR0|CLARENCE DUPNIK, PIMA COUNTY SHERIFF:  
20110111035031.000|20110111035033.000|TR0|When the rhetoric about hatred, about 
20110111035033.000|20110111035035.000|TR0|mistrust of government, about paranoia of 
20110111035035.000|20110111035037.000|TR0|how government operates, and to try to 
20110111035037.000|20110111035039.000|TR0|inflame the public on a daily basis, 24 
20110111035039.000|20110111035041.000|TR0|hours a day, 7 days a week, has impact on 
20110111035041.000|20110111035043.000|TR0|people, especially, who are unbalanced 
20110111035043.000|20110111035046.000|TR0|personalities to begin with.

20110111035052.000|20110111035054.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, the tone of political 
20110111035054.000|20110111035056.000|TR0|rhetoric in general is something that 
20110111035056.000|20110111035058.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords herself has been 
20110111035058.000|20110111035100.000|TR0|concerned with. The night before she was 
20110111035100.000|20110111035103.000|TR0|shot, she sent an e-mail to Kentucky 
20110111035103.000|20110111035105.000|TR0|Secretary of State Trey Grayson, a 
20110111035105.000|20110111035107.000|TR0|Republican, congratulating him for being 
20110111035107.000|20110111035109.000|TR0|named director of Harvard University's 
20110111035109.000|20110111035111.000|TR0|Institute of Politics. This line was in 
20110111035111.000|20110111035113.000|TR0|the e-mail.  Quote, "We need to figure out 
20110111035113.000|20110111035115.000|TR0|how to tone our rhetoric and partisanship 
20110111035115.000|20110111035117.000|TR0|down."

20110111035119.000|20110111035122.000|TR0|Earlier, I spoke with Dana -- excuse me, 
20110111035122.000|20110111035124.000|TR0|Dana Loesch, Republican -- radio host and 
20110111035124.000|20110111035126.000|TR0|Tea Party organizer, and senior political 
20110111035126.000|20110111035128.000|TR0|analyst David Gergen, as well as political 
20110111035128.000|20110111035130.000|TR0|analyst Roland Martin.

20110111035134.000|20110111035136.000|TR0|
20110111035136.000|20110111035139.000|TR0|COOPER:  Roland, the local sheriff in 
20110111035139.000|20110111035141.000|TR0|Arizona pointed a finger at political 
20110111035141.000|20110111035143.000|TR0|rhetoric.  A lot of Democrats have been 
20110111035143.000|20110111035145.000|TR0|echoing that since the shooting.  A lot of 
20110111035145.000|20110111035147.000|TR0|Republicans pushing back.
20110111035147.000|20110111035149.000|TR0|
20110111035149.000|20110111035151.000|TR0|Given there's no evidence this kid was 
20110111035151.000|20110111035153.000|TR0|particularly political but plenty of 
20110111035153.000|20110111035155.000|TR0|evidence he was mentally unstable, is it 
20110111035155.000|20110111035158.000|TR0|appropriate to be using this shooting to 
20110111035158.000|20110111035200.000|TR0|blame politicians?
20110111035200.000|20110111035202.000|TR0|
20110111035202.000|20110111035204.000|TR0|ROLAND MARTIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  I 
20110111035204.000|20110111035206.000|TR0|think it is appropriate for us to examine 
20110111035206.000|20110111035208.000|TR0|the kind of rhetoric we have in this 
20110111035208.000|20110111035210.000|TR0|country right now.       Here's what I 
20110111035210.000|20110111035212.000|TR0|found to be interesting.  Americans always 
20110111035212.000|20110111035215.000|TR0|want for something to happen before we 
20110111035215.000|20110111035217.000|TR0|react.  I think, even though there's 
20110111035217.000|20110111035219.000|TR0|nothing directly related to the political 
20110111035219.000|20110111035221.000|TR0|rhetoric in this particular case, we 
20110111035221.000|20110111035223.000|TR0|should be saying, "Wait a minute.  How hot 
20110111035223.000|20110111035225.000|TR0|is it right now when people are getting 
20110111035225.000|20110111035227.000|TR0|death threats?  You get people are going 
20110111035227.000|20110111035229.000|TR0|after folks' families?  When you see the 
20110111035229.000|20110111035231.000|TR0|kind of letters and e-mails?"
20110111035231.000|20110111035234.000|TR0|
20110111035234.000|20110111035236.000|TR0|So I think the opportunity to examine 
20110111035236.000|20110111035238.000|TR0|ourselves is appropriate, even though 
20110111035238.000|20110111035240.000|TR0|there's no direct correlation.
20110111035240.000|20110111035242.000|TR0|
20110111035242.000|20110111035244.000|TR0|COOPER:  Dana, is this an opportunity to 
20110111035244.000|20110111035246.000|TR0|examine ourselves?  Is that what's been 
20110111035246.000|20110111035248.000|TR0|happening?
20110111035248.000|20110111035251.000|TR0|
20110111035251.000|20110111035253.000|TR0|DANA LOESCH, RADIO HOST/TEA PARTY 
20110111035253.000|20110111035255.000|TR0|ORGANIZER:  Well, I think that the 
20110111035255.000|20110111035257.000|TR0|rhetoric -- the rhetoric has been the same 
20110111035257.000|20110111035259.000|TR0|as it has always been. Nothing has changed 
20110111035259.000|20110111035301.000|TR0|from now from the '60s until now.  
20110111035301.000|20110111035303.000|TR0|Everything has always been the same.
20110111035303.000|20110111035305.000|TR0|
20110111035305.000|20110111035307.000|TR0|What we have to realize is that people can 
20110111035307.000|20110111035310.000|TR0|say what they want to on both sides, but 
20110111035310.000|20110111035312.000|TR0|we cannot excuse the fact that someone 
20110111035312.000|20110111035314.000|TR0|chooses to willfully interpret or perceive 
20110111035314.000|20110111035316.000|TR0|things how they want to.  And again, 
20110111035316.000|20110111035318.000|TR0|there's no evidence at all whatsoever that 
20110111035318.000|20110111035320.000|TR0|this guy listened to talk radio or watched 
20110111035320.000|20110111035322.000|TR0|news programs on the right or the left.
20110111035322.000|20110111035324.000|TR0|
20110111035324.000|20110111035327.000|TR0|COOPER:  David, what about that?  I mean, 
20110111035327.000|20110111035329.000|TR0|Dana raises the point that it's always 
20110111035329.000|20110111035331.000|TR0|been the same kind of rhetoric.  I mean, 
20110111035331.000|20110111035333.000|TR0|if you look back to history going back to, 
20110111035333.000|20110111035335.000|TR0|you know, Revolutionary War days, politics 
20110111035335.000|20110111035337.000|TR0|has always been a rough-and-tumble 
20110111035337.000|20110111035339.000|TR0|business in the United States.
20110111035339.000|20110111035341.000|TR0|
20110111035341.000|20110111035343.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  It 
20110111035343.000|20110111035346.000|TR0|has been rough-and- tumble, Anderson, but 
20110111035346.000|20110111035348.000|TR0|I think it's time to call (ph) the finger- 
20110111035348.000|20110111035350.000|TR0|pointing and the accusations about this 
20110111035350.000|20110111035352.000|TR0|particular incident.
20110111035352.000|20110111035354.000|TR0|
20110111035354.000|20110111035356.000|TR0|But there might be a silver lining here.  
20110111035356.000|20110111035358.000|TR0|And that is I do think it's an 
20110111035358.000|20110111035400.000|TR0|opportunity, to go to Roland's point, an 
20110111035400.000|20110111035403.000|TR0|opportunity for President Obama and the 
20110111035403.000|20110111035405.000|TR0|Republican leadership to come together and 
20110111035405.000|20110111035407.000|TR0|jointly try to sort of see if there are 
20110111035407.000|20110111035409.000|TR0|ways they can get everybody to calm down, 
20110111035409.000|20110111035411.000|TR0|to tone down the rhetoric in our political 
20110111035411.000|20110111035413.000|TR0|discourse.
20110111035413.000|20110111035415.000|TR0|
20110111035415.000|20110111035417.000|TR0|We ought to be doing that, regardless of 
20110111035417.000|20110111035419.000|TR0|whether Tucson happened or not.  It would 
20110111035419.000|20110111035422.000|TR0|be healthy for the -- for the governess of 
20110111035422.000|20110111035424.000|TR0|this country and for a sense of pride 
20110111035424.000|20110111035426.000|TR0|again, once again, and a sense of unity.
20110111035426.000|20110111035428.000|TR0|
20110111035428.000|20110111035430.000|TR0|And I do think that John Boehner, just 
20110111035430.000|20110111035432.000|TR0|like President Obama, they both handled 
20110111035432.000|20110111035434.000|TR0|this well so far.  And I do think they 
20110111035434.000|20110111035436.000|TR0|could come together from both sides of the 
20110111035436.000|20110111035439.000|TR0|aisle.  This will be a moment for real 
20110111035439.000|20110111035441.000|TR0|bipartisanship, to try to get us pulled 
20110111035441.000|20110111035443.000|TR0|together.
20110111035443.000|20110111035445.000|TR0|
20110111035445.000|20110111035447.000|TR0|COOPER:  Dana, a lot of people have raised 
20110111035447.000|20110111035449.000|TR0|the issue, again, about gun control in 
20110111035449.000|20110111035451.000|TR0|this.  Should this guy have been able to 
20110111035451.000|20110111035453.000|TR0|get a gun?  A guy with a -- you know, 
20110111035453.000|20110111035455.000|TR0|people in his school -- he gets kicked out 
20110111035455.000|20110111035458.000|TR0|of school, mental instability.  He's able 
20110111035458.000|20110111035500.000|TR0|to pass an instant background check.       
20110111035500.000|20110111035502.000|TR0|LOESCH:  I go -- I go to my original 
20110111035502.000|20110111035504.000|TR0|point, what I said earlier, Anderson.  And 
20110111035504.000|20110111035506.000|TR0|that is, again, if his behavior had been 
20110111035506.000|20110111035508.000|TR0|reported, there's no way he was going to 
20110111035508.000|20110111035510.000|TR0|walk into a firearms store and purchase 
20110111035510.000|20110111035512.000|TR0|the firearm.  It's not going to happen.
20110111035512.000|20110111035515.000|TR0|
20110111035515.000|20110111035517.000|TR0|But there -- the ball has been dropped, 
20110111035517.000|20110111035519.000|TR0|and it doesn't have to do with the law.  
20110111035519.000|20110111035521.000|TR0|Because the laws are incredibly strong 
20110111035521.000|20110111035523.000|TR0|enough already. The problem here is the 
20110111035523.000|20110111035525.000|TR0|fact that there's no awareness.  There's 
20110111035525.000|20110111035527.000|TR0|no alertness.  People should -- there was 
20110111035527.000|20110111035529.000|TR0|ample opportunity for people to say 
20110111035529.000|20110111035531.000|TR0|something about this kid's behavior or 
20110111035531.000|20110111035534.000|TR0|this young man's behavior, rather.  But 
20110111035534.000|20110111035536.000|TR0|nothing was done.  Nothing...
20110111035536.000|20110111035538.000|TR0|
20110111035538.000|20110111035540.000|TR0|MARTIN:  There was a process.  The 
20110111035540.000|20110111035542.000|TR0|university had a process, but the question 
20110111035542.000|20110111035544.000|TR0|then becomes what do they then do?  Who do 
20110111035544.000|20110111035546.000|TR0|they call? According to our system, unless 
20110111035546.000|20110111035548.000|TR0|a judge declares this individual mentally 
20110111035548.000|20110111035551.000|TR0|ill...
20110111035551.000|20110111035553.000|TR0|
20110111035553.000|20110111035555.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes, seems like...
20110111035555.000|20110111035557.000|TR0|
20110111035557.000|20110111035559.000|TR0|MARTIN:  ... it's easy to say, Well, 
20110111035559.000|20110111035601.000|TR0|report it.  He can't get a permit.
20110111035601.000|20110111035603.000|TR0|
20110111035603.000|20110111035605.000|TR0|LOESCH:  Then pursue it.
20110111035605.000|20110111035607.000|TR0|
20110111035607.000|20110111035610.000|TR0|MARTIN:  Not true.
20110111035610.000|20110111035612.000|TR0|
20110111035612.000|20110111035614.000|TR0|LOESCH:  If it's important enough to 
20110111035614.000|20110111035616.000|TR0|change the law about it, it's definitely 
20110111035616.000|20110111035618.000|TR0|important enough to pursue it.
20110111035618.000|20110111035620.000|TR0|
20110111035620.000|20110111035622.000|TR0|COOPER:  David, where do you come down on 
20110111035622.000|20110111035624.000|TR0|the gun issue?
20110111035624.000|20110111035627.000|TR0|
20110111035627.000|20110111035629.000|TR0|GERGEN:  I think it's insane that people 
20110111035629.000|20110111035631.000|TR0|like this are able to get guns.  How many 
20110111035631.000|20110111035633.000|TR0|incidents does it take like this for us to 
20110111035633.000|20110111035635.000|TR0|realize that people who should not have 
20110111035635.000|20110111035637.000|TR0|guns are able to get them too easily?
20110111035637.000|20110111035639.000|TR0|
20110111035639.000|20110111035641.000|TR0|I'm sorry.  The law has been loosened in 
20110111035641.000|20110111035643.000|TR0|Arizona, unfortunately. And he could carry 
20110111035643.000|20110111035646.000|TR0|a concealed.  What are we doing allowing a 
20110111035646.000|20110111035648.000|TR0|22 year old to carry a concealed weapon 
20110111035648.000|20110111035650.000|TR0|around like this?  He would be able to 
20110111035650.000|20110111035652.000|TR0|walk into a bar.  I'm sorry.  The laws are 
20110111035652.000|20110111035654.000|TR0|too loose.  They are not too tight.
20110111035654.000|20110111035656.000|TR0|
20110111035656.000|20110111035658.000|TR0|LOESCH:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.

20110111035700.000|20110111035703.000|TR0|GERGEN:  We have lowered the standards.  
20110111035703.000|20110111035705.000|TR0|The NRA has been behind this.
20110111035705.000|20110111035707.000|TR0|
20110111035707.000|20110111035709.000|TR0|LOESCH:  No.

20110111035711.000|20110111035713.000|TR0|GERGEN:  And I understand the need for 
20110111035713.000|20110111035715.000|TR0|hunters, and I'm all for that.
20110111035715.000|20110111035717.000|TR0|
20110111035717.000|20110111035719.000|TR0|LOESCH:  I reject that.
20110111035719.000|20110111035722.000|TR0|
20110111035722.000|20110111035724.000|TR0|GERGEN:  But I'm sorry, Dana, there are 
20110111035724.000|20110111035726.000|TR0|people who disagree with you.  If it takes 
20110111035726.000|20110111035728.000|TR0|licensing to...     LOESCH:  No, 
20110111035728.000|20110111035730.000|TR0|statistics show that when you enact 
20110111035730.000|20110111035732.000|TR0|concealed carry, the crime rate plummets.  
20110111035732.000|20110111035734.000|TR0|Show me a county, prove to me, show me a 
20110111035734.000|20110111035736.000|TR0|county where concealed carry has been 
20110111035736.000|20110111035739.000|TR0|implemented where the crime rates haven't 
20110111035739.000|20110111035741.000|TR0|dropped.  I put the burden of proof on you.

20110111035758.000|20110111035800.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Tucson, Arizona, if that doesn't
