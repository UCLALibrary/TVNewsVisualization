20110111020019.000|20110111020021.000|TR0|deadly shootings.  The alleged gunman, 
20110111020021.000|20110111020024.000|TR0|22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner appeared in 
20110111020024.000|20110111020026.000|TR0|court this afternoon where he did not 
20110111020026.000|20110111020028.000|TR0|enter a plea.  He's accused of killing six 
20110111020028.000|20110111020031.000|TR0|people, wounding 14 others including 
20110111020031.000|20110111020033.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords.  His next hearing is

20110111020038.000|20110111020041.000|TR0|The shootings happened on Saturday morning 
20110111020041.000|20110111020043.000|TR0|outside a supermarket in Tucson where 
20110111020043.000|20110111020045.000|TR0|Giffords was meeting with her 
20110111020045.000|20110111020048.000|TR0|constituents.  This was the call that was 
20110111020048.000|20110111020050.000|TR0|made to 911.

20110111020110.000|20110111020112.000|TR0|went in, he just started firing.

20110111020223.000|20110111020225.000|TR0|COOPER:  Giffords, a three-term Democrat, 
20110111020225.000|20110111020228.000|TR0|shot in the head. Tonight she's in a 
20110111020228.000|20110111020230.000|TR0|medical induced coma but doctors say she's 
20110111020230.000|20110111020233.000|TR0|holding her own and they are optimistic 
20110111020233.000|20110111020235.000|TR0|about her prospects for recovery. We'll 
20110111020235.000|20110111020237.000|TR0|talk to Sanjay Gupta in a moment.

20110111020242.000|20110111020245.000|TR0|The mass shooting has unnerved people 
20110111020245.000|20110111020247.000|TR0|across this country, obviously.  On 
20110111020247.000|20110111020250.000|TR0|Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats 
20110111020250.000|20110111020252.000|TR0|expressed concern for the safety of 
20110111020252.000|20110111020255.000|TR0|members of Congress.  This morning, 
20110111020255.000|20110111020257.000|TR0|President Obama and the first lady led the 
20110111020257.000|20110111020259.000|TR0|nation in a moment of silence for the 
20110111020259.000|20110111020302.000|TR0|victims.
20110111020302.000|20110111020304.000|TR0|
20110111020304.000|20110111020307.000|TR0|The moment of silence was also observed on 
20110111020307.000|20110111020309.000|TR0|the steps of the Capitol.  Afterward, the 
20110111020309.000|20110111020312.000|TR0|president had this to say.

20110111020321.000|20110111020324.000|TR0|STATES:  Right now, the main thing we're 
20110111020324.000|20110111020326.000|TR0|doing is to offer our thoughts and prayers 
20110111020326.000|20110111020329.000|TR0|to those who have been impacted, making 
20110111020329.000|20110111020331.000|TR0|sure that we're joining together and 
20110111020331.000|20110111020333.000|TR0|pulling together as a country.
20110111020333.000|20110111020336.000|TR0|
20110111020336.000|20110111020338.000|TR0|And, you know, as president of the United 
20110111020338.000|20110111020341.000|TR0|States, but also as a father, obviously 
20110111020341.000|20110111020343.000|TR0|I'm spending a lot of time just thinking 
20110111020343.000|20110111020346.000|TR0|about the families and reaching out to 
20110111020346.000|20110111020348.000|TR0|them.

20110111020355.000|20110111020358.000|TR0|COOPER:  We'll talk to some of those 
20110111020358.000|20110111020400.000|TR0|family members in the next hour.  We 
20110111020400.000|20110111020403.000|TR0|learned a short time ago that the 
20110111020403.000|20110111020405.000|TR0|president will travel to Tucson on 
20110111020405.000|20110111020408.000|TR0|Wednesday.  White House sources tell CNN 
20110111020408.000|20110111020410.000|TR0|he'll likely attend a memorial service and 
20110111020410.000|20110111020412.000|TR0|visit with families of the victims.

20110111020415.000|20110111020417.000|TR0|We're joined by 360 correspondent Randi 
20110111020417.000|20110111020420.000|TR0|Kaye who is Tucson as is Drew Griffin of 
20110111020420.000|20110111020422.000|TR0|CNN Special Investigations Unit, and Dr. 
20110111020422.000|20110111020425.000|TR0|Sanjay Gupta as well.
20110111020425.000|20110111020427.000|TR0|
20110111020427.000|20110111020429.000|TR0|Randi, take us through what happened on 
20110111020429.000|20110111020432.000|TR0|the morning.  You say this all started 
20110111020432.000|20110111020434.000|TR0|with a tweet from Representative Giffords.
20110111020434.000|20110111020437.000|TR0|
20110111020437.000|20110111020439.000|TR0|RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It did.  
20110111020439.000|20110111020442.000|TR0|The congresswoman, when she's here in 
20110111020442.000|20110111020444.000|TR0|town, Anderson, she does try apparently to 
20110111020444.000|20110111020447.000|TR0|squeeze in about eight or nine events.  So 
20110111020447.000|20110111020449.000|TR0|Saturday morning she sent out a tweet via 
20110111020449.000|20110111020451.000|TR0|twitter at 9:58 a.m. local time here 
20110111020451.000|20110111020454.000|TR0|inviting people to her first event called 
20110111020454.000|20110111020456.000|TR0|"Congress on the Corner."
20110111020456.000|20110111020459.000|TR0|
20110111020459.000|20110111020501.000|TR0|She wanted people to come and ask her 
20110111020501.000|20110111020504.000|TR0|questions.  Tell them what's on her mind.  
20110111020504.000|20110111020506.000|TR0|So that was at 9:58.  Twelve minutes 
20110111020506.000|20110111020508.000|TR0|later, Anderson, she was shot in the head, 
20110111020508.000|20110111020511.000|TR0|gunned down.  So it's unclear at this 
20110111020511.000|20110111020513.000|TR0|point because we don't know a motive about 
20110111020513.000|20110111020516.000|TR0|the suspect or for the suspect.  It's 
20110111020516.000|20110111020518.000|TR0|unclear if maybe he had seen that tweet 
20110111020518.000|20110111020521.000|TR0|and that's what prompted him to go to that 
20110111020521.000|20110111020523.000|TR0|Safeway supermarket or if he was already 
20110111020523.000|20110111020525.000|TR0|there waiting for her.
20110111020525.000|20110111020528.000|TR0|
20110111020528.000|20110111020530.000|TR0|COOPER:  I want to put up the mugshot 
20110111020530.000|20110111020533.000|TR0|we've seen -- that we got today, late 
20110111020533.000|20110111020535.000|TR0|today of this alleged shooter.  This 
20110111020535.000|20110111020538.000|TR0|really is the first indication of what he 
20110111020538.000|20110111020540.000|TR0|looks like now.  We've seen a lot of 
20110111020540.000|20110111020543.000|TR0|pictures with him with hair.  Obviously 
20110111020543.000|20110111020545.000|TR0|his head is shaved.  He's got sort of -- 
20110111020545.000|20110111020547.000|TR0|you can interpret the look he has.       
20110111020547.000|20110111020550.000|TR0|Drew, what do we know about this guy?
20110111020550.000|20110111020552.000|TR0|
20110111020552.000|20110111020555.000|TR0|DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS 
20110111020555.000|20110111020557.000|TR0|UNIT:  Well, we know apparently that his 
20110111020557.000|20110111020600.000|TR0|mental deterioration began junior in high 
20110111020600.000|20110111020602.000|TR0|school, Anderson.  That's when friends say 
20110111020602.000|20110111020604.000|TR0|he had a real mood change and started 
20110111020604.000|20110111020607.000|TR0|using drugs.
20110111020607.000|20110111020609.000|TR0|
20110111020609.000|20110111020612.000|TR0|And we have multiple evidence that last 
20110111020612.000|20110111020614.000|TR0|summer, he was really disturbed, attending 
20110111020614.000|20110111020617.000|TR0|a math class in a community college where 
20110111020617.000|20110111020619.000|TR0|he would create these disturbances, yell 
20110111020619.000|20110111020621.000|TR0|out random things, challenge the teacher, 
20110111020621.000|20110111020624.000|TR0|then go into these silent moans.  The 
20110111020624.000|20110111020626.000|TR0|teacher was very, very afraid, as were 
20110111020626.000|20110111020629.000|TR0|other students.
20110111020629.000|20110111020631.000|TR0|
20110111020631.000|20110111020634.000|TR0|I should say, Anderson, in real time, a 
20110111020634.000|20110111020636.000|TR0|student was sending out e-mails saying, 
20110111020636.000|20110111020639.000|TR0|this guy scares the crap out of me.
20110111020639.000|20110111020641.000|TR0|
20110111020641.000|20110111020643.000|TR0|COOPER:  Yes.  We're going to talk to some 
20110111020643.000|20110111020646.000|TR0|of those students and teachers also in our 
20110111020646.000|20110111020648.000|TR0|next hour.
20110111020648.000|20110111020651.000|TR0|
20110111020651.000|20110111020653.000|TR0|Sanjay, how did Giffords survive a gunshot 
20110111020653.000|20110111020656.000|TR0|wound?  My understanding it went from the 
20110111020656.000|20110111020658.000|TR0|back to the front, so not -- sort of 
20110111020658.000|20110111020700.000|TR0|sideways, which makes a huge difference.
20110111020700.000|20110111020703.000|TR0|
20110111020703.000|20110111020705.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL 
20110111020705.000|20110111020708.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. I mean there 
20110111020708.000|20110111020710.000|TR0|were several factors that sort of tipped 
20110111020710.000|20110111020713.000|TR0|the odds in her favor.  One is that she 
20110111020713.000|20110111020715.000|TR0|got care right at the scene.  You know, 
20110111020715.000|20110111020717.000|TR0|you heard about some of those stories, 
20110111020717.000|20110111020720.000|TR0|people able to stop some of the bleeding 
20110111020720.000|20110111020722.000|TR0|or at least slow it down.
20110111020722.000|20110111020725.000|TR0|
20110111020725.000|20110111020727.000|TR0|She got to the hospital very quickly.  And 
20110111020727.000|20110111020730.000|TR0|then within 38 minutes, she was in the 
20110111020730.000|20110111020732.000|TR0|operating room.  All those things make a 
20110111020732.000|20110111020735.000|TR0|big difference.  Surgeons were able to 
20110111020735.000|20110111020737.000|TR0|take the pressure off the brain pretty 
20110111020737.000|20110111020739.000|TR0|quickly.  And that's the key to an 
20110111020739.000|20110111020742.000|TR0|operation like this.  The bullet like that 
20110111020742.000|20110111020744.000|TR0|causing bleeding being one concern, but 
20110111020744.000|20110111020747.000|TR0|just the injury itself causing swelling 
20110111020747.000|20110111020749.000|TR0|and just pressure on the brain.  That's so 
20110111020749.000|20110111020752.000|TR0|key.
20110111020752.000|20110111020754.000|TR0|
20110111020754.000|20110111020756.000|TR0|One thing I want to show you real quick, 
20110111020756.000|20110111020759.000|TR0|Anderson, if you take a look at the skull 
20110111020759.000|20110111020801.000|TR0|model.  You mentioned the bullet sort of 
20110111020801.000|20110111020804.000|TR0|going from the back on the left side to 
20110111020804.000|20110111020806.000|TR0|the front.  You know surgeons taking out 
20110111020806.000|20110111020809.000|TR0|some of the bone fragments in here first 
20110111020809.000|20110111020811.000|TR0|of all, which can act like missiles as 
20110111020811.000|20110111020813.000|TR0|well, little missiles, and then stopping 
20110111020813.000|20110111020816.000|TR0|the bleeding.
20110111020816.000|20110111020818.000|TR0|
20110111020818.000|20110111020821.000|TR0|But also taking off some more bone around 
20110111020821.000|20110111020823.000|TR0|the skull as well so that -- in 
20110111020823.000|20110111020826.000|TR0|anticipation of swelling.  If the swelling 
20110111020826.000|20110111020828.000|TR0|is to occur later on down the road, the 
20110111020828.000|20110111020831.000|TR0|brain has a place where it can swell as 
20110111020831.000|20110111020833.000|TR0|opposed to, you know, just being forced 
20110111020833.000|20110111020835.000|TR0|into this ridged skull.  So that's sort of 
20110111020835.000|20110111020838.000|TR0|-- that's sort of the point.
20110111020838.000|20110111020840.000|TR0|
20110111020840.000|20110111020843.000|TR0|The other thing is that the bullet sort of 
20110111020843.000|20110111020845.000|TR0|went through and through, Anderson, as 
20110111020845.000|20110111020848.000|TR0|well.  So through the back and out the 
20110111020848.000|20110111020850.000|TR0|front. So some of the energy was sort of 
20110111020850.000|20110111020852.000|TR0|dissipated into the air and into space as 
20110111020852.000|20110111020855.000|TR0|opposed to all sort of within the 
20110111020855.000|20110111020857.000|TR0|inter-cranial cavity.
20110111020857.000|20110111020900.000|TR0|
20110111020900.000|20110111020902.000|TR0|I think those things made a difference.  
20110111020902.000|20110111020905.000|TR0|And she was following commands, which was 
20110111020905.000|20110111020907.000|TR0|amazing, Anderson, when she came in.  Able 
20110111020907.000|20110111020910.000|TR0|to hear a command, able to contextualize, 
20110111020910.000|20110111020912.000|TR0|interpret it, and then execute some sort 
20110111020912.000|20110111020914.000|TR0|of -- you know hold up two fingers, some 
20110111020914.000|20110111020917.000|TR0|sort of body movement based on that.  All 
20110111020917.000|20110111020919.000|TR0|those very good signs, Anderson.
20110111020919.000|20110111020922.000|TR0|
20110111020922.000|20110111020924.000|TR0|COOPER:  So they've taken off a good part 
20110111020924.000|20110111020927.000|TR0|of her skull actually and she's in a 
20110111020927.000|20110111020929.000|TR0|medically-induced coma.  Why would they 
20110111020929.000|20110111020931.000|TR0|put somebody into a medically induced 
20110111020931.000|20110111020934.000|TR0|coma?  What does that do?
20110111020934.000|20110111020936.000|TR0|
20110111020936.000|20110111020939.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, there's really a few 
20110111020939.000|20110111020941.000|TR0|reasons.  One is to control pain.  You 
20110111020941.000|20110111020944.000|TR0|know, someone who has pain after this, the 
20110111020944.000|20110111020946.000|TR0|pain medications, you know can be 
20110111020946.000|20110111020948.000|TR0|sedating.  You also give sedatives to try 
20110111020948.000|20110111020951.000|TR0|and let the person sleep and get rest.  
20110111020951.000|20110111020953.000|TR0|And then some of the medications as well 
20110111020953.000|20110111020956.000|TR0|sort of relax the brain.  That's the best 
20110111020956.000|20110111020958.000|TR0|way to think about it.
20110111020958.000|20110111021001.000|TR0|
20110111021001.000|20110111021003.000|TR0|You want the brain to sort of be as slowed 
20110111021003.000|20110111021006.000|TR0|down as possible during this time so it's 
20110111021006.000|20110111021008.000|TR0|not demanding more blood flow.  It's sort 
20110111021008.000|20110111021010.000|TR0|of reduces the likelihood of swelling.  
20110111021010.000|20110111021013.000|TR0|And the thing about these medications, so 
20110111021013.000|20110111021015.000|TR0|amazing, Anderson, is that you can give 
20110111021015.000|20110111021018.000|TR0|them and then as soon as you stop giving 
20110111021018.000|20110111021020.000|TR0|them through the IV, within a very short 
20110111021020.000|20110111021023.000|TR0|time, within minutes, the patient is 
20110111021023.000|20110111021025.000|TR0|likely to wake up and you can do an exam.
20110111021025.000|20110111021027.000|TR0|
20110111021027.000|20110111021030.000|TR0|You can examine them again and see if 
20110111021030.000|20110111021032.000|TR0|they're still able to follow commands and 
20110111021032.000|20110111021035.000|TR0|just do some simple things.  And that's 
20110111021035.000|20110111021037.000|TR0|really critical.  That's your best sort of 
20110111021037.000|20110111021040.000|TR0|barometer of how she's doing, how the 
20110111021040.000|20110111021042.000|TR0|brain is behaving, is there evidence of 
20110111021042.000|20110111021044.000|TR0|swelling, and they supplement that with 
20110111021044.000|20110111021047.000|TR0|CAT scans to get an exact look.
20110111021047.000|20110111021049.000|TR0|
20110111021049.000|20110111021052.000|TR0|COOPER:  Just incredible.  We're going to 
20110111021052.000|20110111021054.000|TR0|have more with our panel, Sanjay and Drew 
20110111021054.000|20110111021057.000|TR0|and Randi, after the break.

20110111021104.000|20110111021106.000|TR0|dialogue in the country has made it more 
20110111021106.000|20110111021109.000|TR0|dangerous for all of us.

20110111021150.000|20110111021153.000|TR0|events were not just an attack on those 
20110111021153.000|20110111021155.000|TR0|individuals we loved and lost.  But an

20110111021234.000|20110111021236.000|TR0|had another magazine with bullets in it.
20110111021236.000|20110111021239.000|TR0|
20110111021239.000|20110111021241.000|TR0|KAYE:  He did.  In fact, he had used the 
20110111021241.000|20110111021244.000|TR0|first magazine, the first ammunition clip 
20110111021244.000|20110111021246.000|TR0|was empty.  And when the two men tackled 
20110111021246.000|20110111021249.000|TR0|him, he was actually trying to reload.  In 
20110111021249.000|20110111021251.000|TR0|fact, he had reloaded, Anderson.
20110111021251.000|20110111021254.000|TR0|
20110111021254.000|20110111021256.000|TR0|He had another ammunition clip with him, 
20110111021256.000|20110111021258.000|TR0|which he had already put in that -- in 
20110111021258.000|20110111021301.000|TR0|that gun.  And it had 31 bullets in it.  
20110111021301.000|20110111021303.000|TR0|But just by chance, Anderson, the spring 
20110111021303.000|20110111021306.000|TR0|malfunctioned and the gun jammed.  And 
20110111021306.000|20110111021308.000|TR0|that gave pause and that gave two men an 
20110111021308.000|20110111021311.000|TR0|opportunity to tackle him. So this really 
20110111021311.000|20110111021313.000|TR0|could have been so much worse.
20110111021313.000|20110111021315.000|TR0|
20110111021315.000|20110111021318.000|TR0|COOPER:  Drew, you talked about the 
20110111021318.000|20110111021320.000|TR0|history of this guy, the problems he had 
20110111021320.000|20110111021323.000|TR0|had in school.  He got kicked out of 
20110111021323.000|20110111021325.000|TR0|school because of his bizarre behavior.
20110111021325.000|20110111021328.000|TR0|
20110111021328.000|20110111021330.000|TR0|There's a lot of heated political -- you 
20110111021330.000|20110111021332.000|TR0|know heated political rhetoric now, a lot 
20110111021332.000|20110111021335.000|TR0|of finger-pointing by Republicans and 
20110111021335.000|20110111021337.000|TR0|Democrats about whether the heated 
20110111021337.000|20110111021340.000|TR0|political rhetoric in this country in the 
20110111021340.000|20110111021342.000|TR0|last couple of years in some way 
20110111021342.000|20110111021345.000|TR0|contributed to this.
20110111021345.000|20110111021347.000|TR0|
20110111021347.000|20110111021350.000|TR0|Do we know anything -- I know the guy is a 
20110111021350.000|20110111021352.000|TR0|registered independent.  I mean do we know 
20110111021352.000|20110111021354.000|TR0|anything?  Was he particularly political?
20110111021354.000|20110111021357.000|TR0|
20110111021357.000|20110111021359.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  In the sense that he was odd in 
20110111021359.000|20110111021402.000|TR0|political ways.  He would talk about the 
20110111021402.000|20110111021404.000|TR0|Constitution.  His free speech.  I asked 
20110111021404.000|20110111021407.000|TR0|that math instructor, I said, did he have 
20110111021407.000|20110111021409.000|TR0|any kind of political bent?
20110111021409.000|20110111021411.000|TR0|
20110111021411.000|20110111021414.000|TR0|Anderson, he said if he had any political 
20110111021414.000|20110111021416.000|TR0|bent, it was -- he said liberal 
20110111021416.000|20110111021419.000|TR0|pot-smoker.  That was the words that the 
20110111021419.000|20110111021421.000|TR0|math teacher used. Now I can't find any 
20110111021421.000|20110111021424.000|TR0|references to any kind political party in 
20110111021424.000|20110111021426.000|TR0|any of his ramblings.  You said he 
20110111021426.000|20110111021428.000|TR0|registered as a -- an independent.  Wrote 
20110111021428.000|20110111021431.000|TR0|independent on his voter registration 
20110111021431.000|20110111021433.000|TR0|card.  Voted in '06.  Voted in '08.  Did 
20110111021433.000|20110111021436.000|TR0|not vote in 2010, according to the 
20110111021436.000|20110111021438.000|TR0|Register of Voters here.
20110111021438.000|20110111021441.000|TR0|
20110111021441.000|20110111021443.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110111021443.000|20110111021446.000|TR0|
20110111021446.000|20110111021448.000|TR0|COOPER:  So he seems somewhat obsessed 
20110111021448.000|20110111021450.000|TR0|with --
20110111021450.000|20110111021453.000|TR0|
20110111021453.000|20110111021455.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  I mean all this political, you 
20110111021455.000|20110111021458.000|TR0|can't read into it.
20110111021458.000|20110111021500.000|TR0|
20110111021500.000|20110111021503.000|TR0|COOPER:  He seemed obsessed with sort of 
20110111021503.000|20110111021505.000|TR0|U.S. currency and also with language.  He 
20110111021505.000|20110111021507.000|TR0|apparently quizzed even Congresswoman 
20110111021507.000|20110111021510.000|TR0|Giffords at a previous event about how do 
20110111021510.000|20110111021512.000|TR0|we know words mean anything or words to 
20110111021512.000|20110111021515.000|TR0|that effect?
20110111021515.000|20110111021517.000|TR0|
20110111021517.000|20110111021520.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Yes, that was -- that was -- at 
20110111021520.000|20110111021522.000|TR0|2007, he apparently met her at one of 
20110111021522.000|20110111021524.000|TR0|these, you know, meet-your-congressman 
20110111021524.000|20110111021527.000|TR0|gatherings like the one that took place on 
20110111021527.000|20110111021529.000|TR0|Saturday, and according to "Wall Street 
20110111021529.000|20110111021532.000|TR0|Journal" that was his question.
20110111021532.000|20110111021534.000|TR0|
20110111021534.000|20110111021537.000|TR0|How do you know words mean anything?  She 
20110111021537.000|20110111021539.000|TR0|apparently gave an answer.  He was 
20110111021539.000|20110111021542.000|TR0|unsatisfied with it, but that's kind of a 
20110111021542.000|20110111021544.000|TR0|nonsensical stuff.  And I think trying to 
20110111021544.000|20110111021546.000|TR0|read into that any way -- he believes that 
20110111021546.000|20110111021549.000|TR0|everybody in this district was illiterate, 
20110111021549.000|20110111021551.000|TR0|didn't know what they were talking about.
20110111021551.000|20110111021554.000|TR0|
20110111021554.000|20110111021556.000|TR0|And if they believe in the U.S. currency, 
20110111021556.000|20110111021559.000|TR0|they're nuts.  I mean I really would find 
20110111021559.000|20110111021601.000|TR0|it hard to believe that either party can 
20110111021601.000|20110111021603.000|TR0|claim the other party had something to do 
20110111021603.000|20110111021606.000|TR0|with this.
20110111021606.000|20110111021608.000|TR0|
20110111021608.000|20110111021611.000|TR0|COOPER:  Drew, have we heard anything from 
20110111021611.000|20110111021613.000|TR0|this guy's parents yet?  I know -- I mean 
20110111021613.000|20110111021616.000|TR0|I've seen pictures of the outside of his 
20110111021616.000|20110111021618.000|TR0|house and it seems kind of a ramshackle 
20110111021618.000|20110111021620.000|TR0|place in a relatively nice neighborhood.  
20110111021620.000|20110111021623.000|TR0|They're not speaking, though?
20110111021623.000|20110111021625.000|TR0|
20110111021625.000|20110111021628.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  No.  They've apparently spoken 
20110111021628.000|20110111021630.000|TR0|to authorities.  They haven't made any 
20110111021630.000|20110111021633.000|TR0|statements.  I will tell you this.  When 
20110111021633.000|20110111021635.000|TR0|he was kicked out of school, there was a 
20110111021635.000|20110111021638.000|TR0|meeting with campus police, with the dean 
20110111021638.000|20110111021640.000|TR0|and with the parents.  And the parents 
20110111021640.000|20110111021642.000|TR0|were told, look, your son needs help.
20110111021642.000|20110111021645.000|TR0|
20110111021645.000|20110111021647.000|TR0|Your son at least needs a mental clearance 
20110111021647.000|20110111021650.000|TR0|before he can get back on this campus.  We 
20110111021650.000|20110111021652.000|TR0|just don't know what happened after that.  
20110111021652.000|20110111021655.000|TR0|We'll hopefully find out in the coming 
20110111021655.000|20110111021657.000|TR0|days and weeks.
20110111021657.000|20110111021659.000|TR0|
20110111021659.000|20110111021702.000|TR0|COOPER:  The only thing we do know is he 
20110111021702.000|20110111021704.000|TR0|did not get the mental clearance because 
20110111021704.000|20110111021707.000|TR0|he did reappear back at the school.
20110111021707.000|20110111021709.000|TR0|
20110111021709.000|20110111021712.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Yes.  He did not come back to 
20110111021712.000|20110111021714.000|TR0|class.
20110111021714.000|20110111021717.000|TR0|
20110111021717.000|20110111021719.000|TR0|COOPER:  Right.  Sanjay --
20110111021719.000|20110111021721.000|TR0|
20110111021721.000|20110111021724.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  He did not come back to that 
20110111021724.000|20110111021726.000|TR0|campus.
20110111021726.000|20110111021729.000|TR0|
20110111021729.000|20110111021731.000|TR0|COOPER:  Sanjay, of the wounded that 
20110111021731.000|20110111021734.000|TR0|brought to the hospital, the congresswoman 
20110111021734.000|20110111021736.000|TR0|is the only patient still in critical 
20110111021736.000|20110111021738.000|TR0|condition.  What are -- I mean what's the 
20110111021738.000|20110111021741.000|TR0|next step here?  What will doctors be 
20110111021741.000|20110111021743.000|TR0|looking for?
20110111021743.000|20110111021746.000|TR0|
20110111021746.000|20110111021748.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Well, you know, this concern about 
20110111021748.000|20110111021751.000|TR0|brain swelling is a real one.  And then I 
20110111021751.000|20110111021753.000|TR0|think, you know, people give it sort of 
20110111021753.000|20110111021755.000|TR0|different timelines.  Usually around day 
20110111021755.000|20110111021758.000|TR0|three or three days after the injury is 
20110111021758.000|20110111021800.000|TR0|when you sort of have the maximum 
20110111021800.000|20110111021803.000|TR0|swelling.  So that's an important day.  
20110111021803.000|20110111021805.000|TR0|And you know, doctors will be doing those 
20110111021805.000|20110111021808.000|TR0|exams that we talked about, getting the 
20110111021808.000|20110111021810.000|TR0|CAT scans.
20110111021810.000|20110111021813.000|TR0|
20110111021813.000|20110111021815.000|TR0|I think around, you know, day four or five 
20110111021815.000|20110111021817.000|TR0|or so, if there's no increased swelling, 
20110111021817.000|20110111021820.000|TR0|the sort of acute period of swelling 
20110111021820.000|20110111021822.000|TR0|concern will start to come to a close.  
20110111021822.000|20110111021825.000|TR0|But it's not to say that there aren't all 
20110111021825.000|20110111021827.000|TR0|sorts of different other factors here, 
20110111021827.000|20110111021830.000|TR0|Anderson.
20110111021830.000|20110111021832.000|TR0|
20110111021832.000|20110111021834.000|TR0|I got to tell you.  I was a little 
20110111021834.000|20110111021837.000|TR0|surprised.  You know surgeons usually hold 
20110111021837.000|20110111021839.000|TR0|their cards pretty close to the vest when 
20110111021839.000|20110111021842.000|TR0|trying to talk about optimism right after 
20110111021842.000|20110111021844.000|TR0|an operation, especially one like this. 
20110111021844.000|20110111021847.000|TR0|But you heard, like everyone else did, the 
20110111021847.000|20110111021849.000|TR0|doctors, Dr. Rhee, coming out and saying 
20110111021849.000|20110111021851.000|TR0|he was very optimistic, he was as 
20110111021851.000|20110111021854.000|TR0|optimistic as he could be, right after the 
20110111021854.000|20110111021856.000|TR0|operation, just a couple of hours later.

20110111021904.000|20110111021906.000|TR0|GUPTA:  So, I think you know, overall she 
20110111021906.000|20110111021909.000|TR0|has some pretty good signs.  But you know 
20110111021909.000|20110111021911.000|TR0|in the intensive care unit, on a breathing 
20110111021911.000|20110111021913.000|TR0|machine, concerns about infection, 
20110111021913.000|20110111021916.000|TR0|concerns about breathing --

20110111021926.000|20110111021928.000|TR0|of things I think are persistent over the

20110111021947.000|20110111021950.000|TR0|In the days since the shooting, as we've 
20110111021950.000|20110111021952.000|TR0|been talking about, there's been all kinds 
20110111021952.000|20110111021955.000|TR0|of finger-pointing about who is to blame 
20110111021955.000|20110111021957.000|TR0|for the tragedy beyond the shooter 
20110111021957.000|20110111022000.000|TR0|himself, even amid calls to tone down the 
20110111022000.000|20110111022002.000|TR0|rhetoric.
20110111022002.000|20110111022005.000|TR0|
20110111022005.000|20110111022007.000|TR0|It seems to be ratcheting up.  Some 
20110111022007.000|20110111022009.000|TR0|Democrats appear to be using the situation 
20110111022009.000|20110111022012.000|TR0|to point fingers at Republicans, accusing 
20110111022012.000|20110111022014.000|TR0|them of creating a toxic environment of 
20110111022014.000|20110111022017.000|TR0|inflammatory political speech, while 
20110111022017.000|20110111022019.000|TR0|conservative radio is blowing up with 
20110111022019.000|20110111022022.000|TR0|accusations that it's actually the 
20110111022022.000|20110111022024.000|TR0|Democrats who are -- politicizing the 
20110111022024.000|20110111022026.000|TR0|shooting.

20110111022029.000|20110111022031.000|TR0|Now one of the contentious points is the 
20110111022031.000|20110111022034.000|TR0|mere mention by either side of a 
20110111022034.000|20110111022036.000|TR0|controversy involving Sarah Palin.  
20110111022036.000|20110111022039.000|TR0|Campaigning back in March, you'll remember 
20110111022039.000|20110111022041.000|TR0|Palin posted a map on Facebook putting 
20110111022041.000|20110111022043.000|TR0|crosshairs over several 
20110111022043.000|20110111022046.000|TR0|Democratic-controlled districts including

20110111022051.000|20110111022053.000|TR0|That same time, Palin tweeted, quote,

20110111022056.000|20110111022058.000|TR0|America don't retreat, instead reload."  
20110111022058.000|20110111022101.000|TR0|Representative Giffords herself took issue 
20110111022101.000|20110111022103.000|TR0|with Palin's imagery.  Here's what she

20110111022118.000|20110111022120.000|TR0|the thing is, that the way that she has it 
20110111022120.000|20110111022122.000|TR0|depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight

20110111022209.000|20110111022211.000|TR0|picking the right candidate, too, John

20110111022410.000|20110111022413.000|TR0|Dana, in the past, a lot of conservatives 
20110111022413.000|20110111022415.000|TR0|have blamed violent acts -- whether it's, 
20110111022415.000|20110111022418.000|TR0|you know, shooting up a school, on 
20110111022418.000|20110111022420.000|TR0|something like video games or music or

20110111022423.000|20110111022425.000|TR0|things, why shouldn't one be willing to 
20110111022425.000|20110111022427.000|TR0|blame heated or violent political rhetoric?

20110111022435.000|20110111022437.000|TR0|don't think that it was correct for anyone 
20110111022437.000|20110111022440.000|TR0|to blame any of the past violence in 
20110111022440.000|20110111022442.000|TR0|schools on music or on anything that they 
20110111022442.000|20110111022445.000|TR0|see in film because it -- it immediately 
20110111022445.000|20110111022447.000|TR0|passes responsibility of the parents to 
20110111022447.000|20110111022449.000|TR0|assume responsibility of their children 
20110111022449.000|20110111022452.000|TR0|and for the people who carry these acts 
20110111022452.000|20110111022454.000|TR0|out to assume responsibility.

20110111022457.000|20110111022459.000|TR0|And I apply the exact same thing to this

20110111022504.000|20110111022506.000|TR0|sides aren't speaking in literal terms.  
20110111022506.000|20110111022509.000|TR0|Both sides are free to make metaphorical 
20110111022509.000|20110111022511.000|TR0|analogies.  And I think that they're also 
20110111022511.000|20110111022514.000|TR0|free to not be blamed when someone of 
20110111022514.000|20110111022516.000|TR0|their own will decides to commit a heinous 
20110111022516.000|20110111022519.000|TR0|act such as what we saw in Arizona.
20110111022519.000|20110111022521.000|TR0|
20110111022521.000|20110111022523.000|TR0|COOPER:  David, what about that?  You 
20110111022523.000|20110111022526.000|TR0|served in White House when passed 
20110111022526.000|20110111022528.000|TR0|presidents, you know, have faced this kind 
20110111022528.000|20110111022531.000|TR0|of tragedies.  Is examining political 
20110111022531.000|20110111022533.000|TR0|discourse in the wake of an incident like 
20110111022533.000|20110111022536.000|TR0|appropriate or without any evidence he was 
20110111022536.000|20110111022538.000|TR0|a follower of anyone in particular?  Is it 
20110111022538.000|20110111022541.000|TR0|premature?
20110111022541.000|20110111022543.000|TR0|
20110111022543.000|20110111022545.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110111022545.000|20110111022548.000|TR0|ANALYST:  I think we have to exercise 
20110111022548.000|20110111022550.000|TR0|great care here, Anderson.  As you 
20110111022550.000|20110111022553.000|TR0|remember, there were many times during the 
20110111022553.000|20110111022555.000|TR0|election campaign, even going all the way 
20110111022555.000|20110111022558.000|TR0|back to the town halls, when we lamented 
20110111022558.000|20110111022600.000|TR0|on this program the incitements that were 
20110111022600.000|20110111022602.000|TR0|there.
20110111022602.000|20110111022605.000|TR0|
20110111022605.000|20110111022607.000|TR0|People showing up with guns.  Someone 
20110111022607.000|20110111022610.000|TR0|yelling out at a Palin rally, you know, 
20110111022610.000|20110111022612.000|TR0|kill him, kill him.  And to his great 
20110111022612.000|20110111022615.000|TR0|credit, John McCain put a stop to that.  
20110111022615.000|20110111022617.000|TR0|But we worried about would this eventually 
20110111022617.000|20110111022620.000|TR0|lead to some sort of violence.  And I 
20110111022620.000|20110111022622.000|TR0|think there's a continuing concern about 
20110111022622.000|20110111022624.000|TR0|that.
20110111022624.000|20110111022627.000|TR0|
20110111022627.000|20110111022629.000|TR0|But having said that, which is very 
20110111022629.000|20110111022632.000|TR0|important, we need to deal with it.  There 
20110111022632.000|20110111022634.000|TR0|is no connection, clear or vague, between 
20110111022634.000|20110111022637.000|TR0|that rhetoric and what this deranged 
20110111022637.000|20110111022639.000|TR0|fellow did.  And in that sense, I think 
20110111022639.000|20110111022641.000|TR0|it's inappropriate to point fingers and 
20110111022641.000|20110111022644.000|TR0|make accusations, trying to link the 
20110111022644.000|20110111022646.000|TR0|rhetoric to this rampage.
20110111022646.000|20110111022649.000|TR0|
20110111022649.000|20110111022651.000|TR0|If anything, the accusations and all of 
20110111022651.000|20110111022654.000|TR0|this name-calling is only further 
20110111022654.000|20110111022656.000|TR0|poisoning the discourse in this country 
20110111022656.000|20110111022658.000|TR0|and further polarizing us as a people.  
20110111022658.000|20110111022701.000|TR0|President Obama had it right today.  We 
20110111022701.000|20110111022703.000|TR0|need to pull together as a people.
20110111022703.000|20110111022706.000|TR0|
20110111022706.000|20110111022708.000|TR0|COOPER:  We're going to have Bill Maher on 
20110111022708.000|20110111022711.000|TR0|in a moment for a couple of blocks.  And 
20110111022711.000|20110111022713.000|TR0|he frankly does point the finger at the 
20110111022713.000|20110111022716.000|TR0|rhetoric and at the vitriol and at 
20110111022716.000|20110111022718.000|TR0|Republicans in particular.
20110111022718.000|20110111022720.000|TR0|
20110111022720.000|20110111022723.000|TR0|Dana -- and we're going to have Dana and 
20110111022723.000|20110111022725.000|TR0|David on afterward to get to respond to 
20110111022725.000|20110111022728.000|TR0|what he said.  But it does seem like some 
20110111022728.000|20110111022730.000|TR0|on the right now may be trying to score 
20110111022730.000|20110111022733.000|TR0|political points by accusing people on the 
20110111022733.000|20110111022735.000|TR0|left of trying to score political points.
20110111022735.000|20110111022737.000|TR0|
20110111022737.000|20110111022740.000|TR0|I mean this whole thing, it's interesting 
20110111022740.000|20110111022742.000|TR0|in the last couple of days how quickly it 
20110111022742.000|20110111022745.000|TR0|became politicized.
20110111022745.000|20110111022747.000|TR0|
20110111022747.000|20110111022750.000|TR0|LOESCH:  Oh, it's very -- it's kind of 
20110111022750.000|20110111022752.000|TR0|shocking to sort of see it.  And it's 
20110111022752.000|20110111022754.000|TR0|interesting to think that simply a 
20110111022754.000|20110111022757.000|TR0|conservative defending themselves against 
20110111022757.000|20110111022759.000|TR0|the charge of being called a murderer, as 
20110111022759.000|20110111022802.000|TR0|I've seen done with Sarah Palin, I've seen 
20110111022802.000|20110111022804.000|TR0|done with more people than I can count, 
20110111022804.000|20110111022807.000|TR0|including myself.
20110111022807.000|20110111022809.000|TR0|
20110111022809.000|20110111022812.000|TR0|I myself have received threats in e-mail 
20110111022812.000|20110111022814.000|TR0|and been called a murderer from people who 
20110111022814.000|20110111022816.000|TR0|are trying to condemn this vitriolic 
20110111022816.000|20110111022819.000|TR0|rhetoric while also engaging in it at the 
20110111022819.000|20110111022821.000|TR0|same time.  It makes no sense to me.
20110111022821.000|20110111022824.000|TR0|
20110111022824.000|20110111022826.000|TR0|But the bottom line is that all of this is 
20110111022826.000|20110111022829.000|TR0|completely obscuring two massive points.  
20110111022829.000|20110111022831.000|TR0|Those two points are the fact that five 
20110111022831.000|20110111022833.000|TR0|people are dead including a child.  And 
20110111022833.000|20110111022836.000|TR0|the second point is that this is in a long 
20110111022836.000|20110111022838.000|TR0|line of -- this is a trend.  We see these 
20110111022838.000|20110111022841.000|TR0|lone wolf sort of antagonists over and 
20110111022841.000|20110111022843.000|TR0|over again.  And nothing preemptive is 
20110111022843.000|20110111022846.000|TR0|done.
20110111022846.000|20110111022848.000|TR0|
20110111022848.000|20110111022850.000|TR0|We find out after the fact that all these 
20110111022850.000|20110111022853.000|TR0|warning signs are there.  Confessions all 
20110111022853.000|20110111022855.000|TR0|over the Internet, people from like -- 
20110111022855.000|20110111022858.000|TR0|with Jared Lee Loughner, the community 
20110111022858.000|20110111022900.000|TR0|college, his parents, friends were saying 
20110111022900.000|20110111022903.000|TR0|that he's been this -- been this way for 
20110111022903.000|20110111022905.000|TR0|incredibly long time. Nothing was done.
20110111022905.000|20110111022908.000|TR0|
20110111022908.000|20110111022910.000|TR0|And so I think we need to just kind of 
20110111022910.000|20110111022912.000|TR0|start focusing on what can be done 
20110111022912.000|20110111022915.000|TR0|preemptively to identify this kind of 
20110111022915.000|20110111022917.000|TR0|stuff.  He's been stalking her for three 
20110111022917.000|20110111022920.000|TR0|years and he's made a death threat before. 
20110111022920.000|20110111022922.000|TR0| Why was this allowed to happen?
20110111022922.000|20110111022925.000|TR0|
20110111022925.000|20110111022927.000|TR0|COOPER:  David, it does seem like in the 
20110111022927.000|20110111022929.000|TR0|wake of these things --
20110111022929.000|20110111022932.000|TR0|
20110111022932.000|20110111022934.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Yes.
20110111022934.000|20110111022937.000|TR0|
20110111022937.000|20110111022939.000|TR0|COOPER:  -- that a lot of questions are 
20110111022939.000|20110111022942.000|TR0|always raised about whether it's on gun 
20110111022942.000|20110111022944.000|TR0|control or the mental health system.  And 
20110111022944.000|20110111022946.000|TR0|yet it doesn't seem like much changes.
20110111022946.000|20110111022949.000|TR0|
20110111022949.000|20110111022951.000|TR0|GERGEN:  It doesn't.  And I just wanted to 
20110111022951.000|20110111022954.000|TR0|ask, and you say something needs to be 
20110111022954.000|20110111022956.000|TR0|done.  How is it possible that someone who 
20110111022956.000|20110111022959.000|TR0|is this unhinged, when so many people 
20110111022959.000|20110111023001.000|TR0|understood that he was in mental 
20110111023001.000|20110111023004.000|TR0|deterioration, that he could still walk 
20110111023004.000|20110111023006.000|TR0|into a gun store and buy, you know, .9 mm 
20110111023006.000|20110111023008.000|TR0|semiautomatic Glock handgun?  And also 
20110111023008.000|20110111023011.000|TR0|then carry it concealed?
20110111023011.000|20110111023013.000|TR0|
20110111023013.000|20110111023016.000|TR0|I mean that's -- if there's some cultural 
20110111023016.000|20110111023018.000|TR0|insanity here, it is the fact that we 
20110111023018.000|20110111023021.000|TR0|haven't put a stop to the capacity of 
20110111023021.000|20110111023023.000|TR0|these deranged young people to buy guns 
20110111023023.000|20110111023025.000|TR0|and then spray at people.  It's just 
20110111023025.000|20110111023028.000|TR0|unbelievable.
20110111023028.000|20110111023030.000|TR0|
20110111023030.000|20110111023033.000|TR0|LOESCH:  It's not the -- I have to --
20110111023033.000|20110111023035.000|TR0|
20110111023035.000|20110111023038.000|TR0|COOPER:  Dana?
20110111023038.000|20110111023040.000|TR0|
20110111023040.000|20110111023042.000|TR0|LOESCH:  I have to disagree with you, Mr. 
20110111023042.000|20110111023045.000|TR0|Gergen, on that.  It's not the gun law.  
20110111023045.000|20110111023047.000|TR0|It's the fact that he was refused from the 
20110111023047.000|20110111023050.000|TR0|military. He made a death threat before.  
20110111023050.000|20110111023052.000|TR0|And he had problems and was removed from 
20110111023052.000|20110111023055.000|TR0|community college.  None of this was 
20110111023055.000|20110111023057.000|TR0|reported.
20110111023057.000|20110111023100.000|TR0|
20110111023100.000|20110111023102.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Do you think --
20110111023102.000|20110111023104.000|TR0|
20110111023104.000|20110111023107.000|TR0|LOESCH:  That has nothing to do with the 
20110111023107.000|20110111023109.000|TR0|gun laws on the book.
20110111023109.000|20110111023112.000|TR0|
20110111023112.000|20110111023114.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Do you think it's appropriate 
20110111023114.000|20110111023117.000|TR0|that he was able to buy a gun?
20110111023117.000|20110111023119.000|TR0|
20110111023119.000|20110111023121.000|TR0|LOESCH:  I think it's inappropriate the 
20110111023121.000|20110111023124.000|TR0|fact that you had his parents that knew 
20110111023124.000|20110111023126.000|TR0|about his behavior, the community college 
20110111023126.000|20110111023129.000|TR0|and the military --
20110111023129.000|20110111023131.000|TR0|
20110111023131.000|20110111023134.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Well, just answer the question.   
20110111023134.000|20110111023136.000|TR0|    (CROSSTALK)
20110111023136.000|20110111023138.000|TR0|
20110111023138.000|20110111023141.000|TR0|LOESCH:  Well, do you think that those 
20110111023141.000|20110111023143.000|TR0|people are able to orchestrate the -- do 
20110111023143.000|20110111023146.000|TR0|you think those people should be able to 
20110111023146.000|20110111023148.000|TR0|decide who can and cannot get guns?  These 
20110111023148.000|20110111023151.000|TR0|-- why wasn't this reported?  If these had 
20110111023151.000|20110111023153.000|TR0|been reported, he wouldn't have been able 
20110111023153.000|20110111023156.000|TR0|to get one in the first place.
20110111023156.000|20110111023158.000|TR0|
20110111023158.000|20110111023200.000|TR0|So the argument that there's some -- a 
20110111023200.000|20110111023203.000|TR0|problem with the law is irrelevant.  The 
20110111023203.000|20110111023205.000|TR0|fact that if his behavior had been 
20110111023205.000|20110111023208.000|TR0|reported, he would not have been able to 
20110111023208.000|20110111023210.000|TR0|purchase a firearm.  End of story.

20110111023215.000|20110111023217.000|TR0|David and Dana coming up. We'll talk more

20110111023222.000|20110111023225.000|TR0|Up next, a very different perspective.  In 
20110111023225.000|20110111023227.000|TR0|particular on the gun issue as well.  
20110111023227.000|20110111023230.000|TR0|We'll talk to a man who says the U.S. is a 
20110111023230.000|20110111023232.000|TR0|well-armed country with a lot of nutty 
20110111023232.000|20110111023234.000|TR0|people in it.  We're talking about Bill 
20110111023234.000|20110111023237.000|TR0|Maher, host of HBO's "Real Time with Bill 
20110111023237.000|20110111023239.000|TR0|Maher."  He's coming up in just a moment.

20110111023254.000|20110111023256.000|TR0|Michelle in keeping all the victims and 
20110111023256.000|20110111023259.000|TR0|their families, including Gabby, in our 
20110111023259.000|20110111023301.000|TR0|thoughts and prayers.  Those who have been 
20110111023301.000|20110111023304.000|TR0|injured, we are rooting for them. And I 
20110111023304.000|20110111023306.000|TR0|know Gabby is as tough as they come.  And 
20110111023306.000|20110111023309.000|TR0|I am hopeful that she's going to pull 
20110111023309.000|20110111023311.000|TR0|through.

20110111023321.000|20110111023323.000|TR0|weekend.  And Congresswoman Giffords, just 
20110111023323.000|20110111023326.000|TR0|to update, remains in critical but stable 
20110111023326.000|20110111023328.000|TR0|condition in a hospital.  Thirteen others 
20110111023328.000|20110111023330.000|TR0|were wounded in Saturday's shooting.  Six 
20110111023330.000|20110111023333.000|TR0|others killed.

20110111023335.000|20110111023338.000|TR0|The alleged shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, 
20110111023338.000|20110111023340.000|TR0|in federal court today where he did not 
20110111023340.000|20110111023343.000|TR0|enter a plea.

20110111023345.000|20110111023348.000|TR0|Joining us now is Bill Maher, host of 
20110111023348.000|20110111023350.000|TR0|HBO's "Real Time with Bill Maher."
20110111023350.000|20110111023352.000|TR0|
20110111023352.000|20110111023355.000|TR0|Bill, when you first heard the news that a 
20110111023355.000|20110111023357.000|TR0|member of Congress had been shot in a 
20110111023357.000|20110111023400.000|TR0|politically heated state like Arizona, 
20110111023400.000|20110111023402.000|TR0|what was your initial reaction?
20110111023402.000|20110111023405.000|TR0|
20110111023405.000|20110111023407.000|TR0|That this is really the only country in 
20110111023407.000|20110111023409.000|TR0|the world that shoots its leaders at the 
20110111023409.000|20110111023412.000|TR0|rate that we do.  The last time I think a 
20110111023412.000|20110111023414.000|TR0|leader was shot in Britain was 1812.  
20110111023414.000|20110111023417.000|TR0|Canada has had 15 or 16 prime ministers, 
20110111023417.000|20110111023419.000|TR0|how many have been shot?  Zero.
20110111023419.000|20110111023422.000|TR0|
20110111023422.000|20110111023424.000|TR0|BILL MAHER, HOST, HBO'S "REAL TIME":  It's 
20110111023424.000|20110111023427.000|TR0|a very well-armed country with a lot of 
20110111023427.000|20110111023429.000|TR0|nutty people.  And that's a very bad 
20110111023429.000|20110111023431.000|TR0|combination.       COOPER:  Is it fair at 
20110111023431.000|20110111023434.000|TR0|this point -- I mean obviously there's 
20110111023434.000|20110111023436.000|TR0|been a lot of soul searching, a lot of 
20110111023436.000|20110111023439.000|TR0|finger pointing at this point. Is it fair 
20110111023439.000|20110111023441.000|TR0|to be placing blame at the feet of anyone 
20110111023441.000|20110111023444.000|TR0|other than the shooter at this point?
20110111023444.000|20110111023446.000|TR0|
20110111023446.000|20110111023448.000|TR0|MAHER:  Yes.  I mean, not direct blame.  
20110111023448.000|20110111023451.000|TR0|No.  This guy was clearly a nut.  I mean, 
20110111023451.000|20110111023453.000|TR0|a schizophrenic, a paranoid.  I don't 
20110111023453.000|20110111023456.000|TR0|know. I'm not a psychologist.  But nut 
20110111023456.000|20110111023458.000|TR0|would be the layman's term.
20110111023458.000|20110111023501.000|TR0|
20110111023501.000|20110111023503.000|TR0|But it's also clear that he was very 
20110111023503.000|20110111023505.000|TR0|antigovernment.  I mean if you read some 
20110111023505.000|20110111023508.000|TR0|of the stuff that we have -- that we know 
20110111023508.000|20110111023510.000|TR0|he wrote, I mean, it's sprinkled with 
20110111023510.000|20110111023513.000|TR0|things anti-government ideas, treason, 
20110111023513.000|20110111023515.000|TR0|tyranny, of the gold get off -- get back 
20110111023515.000|20110111023518.000|TR0|to the gold standard, that kind of stuff 
20110111023518.000|20110111023520.000|TR0|that seems like -- you know, I don't know 
20110111023520.000|20110111023523.000|TR0|who else but Glenn Beck talks about that 
20110111023523.000|20110111023525.000|TR0|stuff.  I'm not saying he was specifically 
20110111023525.000|20110111023527.000|TR0|listening to Mr. Beck or anybody else.
20110111023527.000|20110111023530.000|TR0|
20110111023530.000|20110111023532.000|TR0|But Glenn Beck is also a little nutty.  
20110111023532.000|20110111023535.000|TR0|You know, I mean, this Jared guy's 
20110111023535.000|20110111023537.000|TR0|chalkboard in his basement, I'm not sure 
20110111023537.000|20110111023540.000|TR0|it wouldn't look that different than Glenn 
20110111023540.000|20110111023542.000|TR0|Beck's chalkboard.  Yes, I think it's 
20110111023542.000|20110111023544.000|TR0|disingenuous for the right wing, as I've 
20110111023544.000|20110111023547.000|TR0|heard them say today, that we can't make 
20110111023547.000|20110111023549.000|TR0|any connection here or else the -- or the 
20110111023549.000|20110111023552.000|TR0|false equivalency argument that I hear, 
20110111023552.000|20110111023554.000|TR0|you know.  There's a lot of nuts on the 
20110111023554.000|20110111023557.000|TR0|left, too.
20110111023557.000|20110111023559.000|TR0|
20110111023559.000|20110111023601.000|TR0|Yeah, there are nutty people on the left, 
20110111023601.000|20110111023604.000|TR0|too.  They don't make threats.  They don't 
20110111023604.000|20110111023606.000|TR0|talk about guns.  I heard someone on NPR 
20110111023606.000|20110111023609.000|TR0|today say, well, when Bush was president, 
20110111023609.000|20110111023611.000|TR0|there was Bush equals Hitler signs.  From 
20110111023611.000|20110111023614.000|TR0|who?  Not from someone in Congress.  Yeah, 
20110111023614.000|20110111023616.000|TR0|there's always going to be some nut out 
20110111023616.000|20110111023619.000|TR0|there.  I don't know who had that sign.
20110111023619.000|20110111023621.000|TR0|
20110111023621.000|20110111023623.000|TR0|But Sarah Palin put the cross hairs up on 
20110111023623.000|20110111023626.000|TR0|her website.  That's a person in a 
20110111023626.000|20110111023628.000|TR0|position of authority.  Her other example 
20110111023628.000|20110111023631.000|TR0|was, you know, Keith Olbermann says Worst 
20110111023631.000|20110111023633.000|TR0|Person in the World.  Well, first of all, 
20110111023633.000|20110111023636.000|TR0|it's comedy.  It's tongue in cheek.  And 
20110111023636.000|20110111023638.000|TR0|it's very different than what Allan West 
20110111023638.000|20110111023640.000|TR0|talks about, what Michele Bachmann talks 
20110111023640.000|20110111023643.000|TR0|about.  I want to, you know, keep my 
20110111023643.000|20110111023645.000|TR0|opponents scared to come out of his house. 
20110111023645.000|20110111023648.000|TR0| I want Minnesotans armed and dangerous.
20110111023648.000|20110111023650.000|TR0|
20110111023650.000|20110111023653.000|TR0|Sharron Angle with 2nd Amendment remedies. 
20110111023653.000|20110111023655.000|TR0| You float these ideas.  Nobody on the 
20110111023655.000|20110111023657.000|TR0|left is saying it would cause a rational 
20110111023657.000|20110111023700.000|TR0|person to do something crazy.  We're 
20110111023700.000|20110111023702.000|TR0|saying it goes out to the borderline 
20110111023702.000|20110111023705.000|TR0|cases, the nutty people.  But it's always 
20110111023705.000|20110111023707.000|TR0|from the right.
20110111023707.000|20110111023710.000|TR0|
20110111023710.000|20110111023712.000|TR0|COOPER:  But at this point, I mean -- 
20110111023712.000|20110111023715.000|TR0|well, first of all, a lot of people on the 
20110111023715.000|20110111023717.000|TR0|right will point to a comment that 
20110111023717.000|20110111023719.000|TR0|President Obama -- I think then candidate 
20110111023719.000|20110111023722.000|TR0|Obama made about, you know, bringing a gun 
20110111023722.000|20110111023724.000|TR0|to a knife fight.  That's the line I've 
20110111023724.000|20110111023727.000|TR0|heard a lot today.  Is that a fair 
20110111023727.000|20110111023729.000|TR0|comparison?
20110111023729.000|20110111023732.000|TR0|
20110111023732.000|20110111023734.000|TR0|MAHER:  No, it's not.  I mean, maybe it's 
20110111023734.000|20110111023736.000|TR0|unfortunate that he would use that 
20110111023736.000|20110111023739.000|TR0|metaphor.  But, you know, there are such 
20110111023739.000|20110111023741.000|TR0|things as guns and knives in the world.  
20110111023741.000|20110111023744.000|TR0|We're not trying to say you can't use 
20110111023744.000|20110111023746.000|TR0|those words ever in speech.  But it's a 
20110111023746.000|20110111023749.000|TR0|lot different than the this sort of direct 
20110111023749.000|20110111023751.000|TR0|idea that it's OK to threaten with bodily 
20110111023751.000|20110111023753.000|TR0|harm the people you disagree with.  Jesse 
20110111023753.000|20110111023756.000|TR0|Kelly, I saw in the paper, there's an ad 
20110111023756.000|20110111023758.000|TR0|that --      COOPER:  That's the person 
20110111023758.000|20110111023801.000|TR0|who was running against the congresswoman.
20110111023801.000|20110111023803.000|TR0|
20110111023803.000|20110111023806.000|TR0|MAHER:  Right.  Which said help remove her 
20110111023806.000|20110111023808.000|TR0|from office.  And in the next line talked 
20110111023808.000|20110111023811.000|TR0|about firing M-16s.  You know, this -- 
20110111023811.000|20110111023813.000|TR0|this kind of stuff is not what goes on on 
20110111023813.000|20110111023815.000|TR0|the left.  You cannot -- you cannot point 
20110111023815.000|20110111023818.000|TR0|to any sort of equivalency here.
20110111023818.000|20110111023820.000|TR0|
20110111023820.000|20110111023823.000|TR0|And as always, the media gets that wrong.  
20110111023823.000|20110111023825.000|TR0|They try to -- they try to make it like 
20110111023825.000|20110111023828.000|TR0|they're being fair because they're making 
20110111023828.000|20110111023830.000|TR0|everything 50/50.  Well, if you're not 
20110111023830.000|20110111023832.000|TR0|being truthful, and that's not truthful, 
20110111023832.000|20110111023835.000|TR0|then you're not being fair.
20110111023835.000|20110111023837.000|TR0|
20110111023837.000|20110111023840.000|TR0|COOPER:  I want to play -- we just showed 
20110111023840.000|20110111023842.000|TR0|our viewers that cross hairs image that 
20110111023842.000|20110111023845.000|TR0|Sarah Palin put with this congresswoman's 
20110111023845.000|20110111023847.000|TR0|district in the cross hairs.  It's 
20110111023847.000|20110111023849.000|TR0|interesting now -- this was -- there's no 
20110111023849.000|20110111023852.000|TR0|evidence that this shooter or the alleged 
20110111023852.000|20110111023854.000|TR0|shooter saw this or was influenced in any 
20110111023854.000|20110111023857.000|TR0|way by this.  But one of her advisers 
20110111023857.000|20110111023859.000|TR0|tried to explain that image over the 
20110111023859.000|20110111023902.000|TR0|weekend during a radio interview.  This is 
20110111023902.000|20110111023904.000|TR0|one of Sarah Palin's advisers, Rebecca 
20110111023904.000|20110111023907.000|TR0|Mansour, on "The Tammy Bruce Show."

20110111023914.000|20110111023916.000|TR0|REBECCA MANSOUR, ADVISER TO SARAH PALIN:  
20110111023916.000|20110111023919.000|TR0|I just want to clarify again -- maybe it 
20110111023919.000|20110111023921.000|TR0|wasn't done on the record enough by us 
20110111023921.000|20110111023924.000|TR0|when this graphic came out.  The graphic 
20110111023924.000|20110111023926.000|TR0|is just -- it's basically -- we never, 
20110111023926.000|20110111023928.000|TR0|ever, ever intended it to be gun fights.  
20110111023928.000|20110111023931.000|TR0|It was simply cross hairs like you'd see 
20110111023931.000|20110111023933.000|TR0|on maps.

20110111023936.000|20110111023938.000|TR0|TAMMY BRUCE, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  It's a 
20110111023938.000|20110111023941.000|TR0|surveyor symbol.
20110111023941.000|20110111023943.000|TR0|
20110111023943.000|20110111023945.000|TR0|MANSOUR:  Right.  I just want to say this, 
20110111023945.000|20110111023948.000|TR0|if I can.
20110111023948.000|20110111023950.000|TR0|
20110111023950.000|20110111023953.000|TR0|BRUCE:  Please.

20110111023955.000|20110111023958.000|TR0|MANSOUR:  This graphic was done -- you 
20110111023958.000|20110111024000.000|TR0|know, it was done not even in-house.  We 
20110111024000.000|20110111024003.000|TR0|had a professional who does political -- 
20110111024003.000|20110111024005.000|TR0|you know, a political graphic artist, 
20110111024005.000|20110111024007.000|TR0|consultant do this for us.

20110111024015.000|20110111024017.000|TR0|COOPER:  It's interesting.  In a Tweet 
20110111024017.000|20110111024020.000|TR0|earlier, a couple of months ago, Sarah 
20110111024020.000|20110111024022.000|TR0|Palin actually described it as the bulls 
20110111024022.000|20110111024024.000|TR0|eye icon. Do you buy that that that was 
20110111024024.000|20110111024027.000|TR0|just a surveyor symbol?
20110111024027.000|20110111024029.000|TR0|
20110111024029.000|20110111024032.000|TR0|MAHER:  No, I don't.  But if it is, would 
20110111024032.000|20110111024034.000|TR0|it be okay if Keith Ellison, the Muslim 
20110111024034.000|20110111024037.000|TR0|member of Congress, put that up on his 
20110111024037.000|20110111024039.000|TR0|website? Can you imagine if he put that on 
20110111024039.000|20110111024041.000|TR0|his website targeting his political 
20110111024041.000|20110111024044.000|TR0|opponents?  Do you think they'd just let 
20110111024044.000|20110111024046.000|TR0|that go over at Fox News?
20110111024046.000|20110111024049.000|TR0|
20110111024049.000|20110111024051.000|TR0|COOPER:  There are other whose have said, 
20110111024051.000|20110111024054.000|TR0|look, liberals are kind of jumping on this 
20110111024054.000|20110111024056.000|TR0|and using this as a way to bludgeon 
20110111024056.000|20110111024059.000|TR0|conservatives right now.  But that when 
20110111024059.000|20110111024101.000|TR0|Major Nadal Hasan killed people on that 
20110111024101.000|20110111024103.000|TR0|base last year that a lot of people said, 
20110111024103.000|20110111024106.000|TR0|look, don't rush to judge.  Was there -- 
20110111024106.000|20110111024108.000|TR0|was there a -- is there a double standard 
20110111024108.000|20110111024111.000|TR0|here?       MAHER:  I'm not even really 
20110111024111.000|20110111024113.000|TR0|following that analogy, but I -- I 
20110111024113.000|20110111024116.000|TR0|certainly am not one of the people who was 
20110111024116.000|20110111024118.000|TR0|not judging Major Hasan.  I judge him.  
20110111024118.000|20110111024120.000|TR0|Yes, I've been accused oftentimes of being 
20110111024120.000|20110111024123.000|TR0|judgmental against Muslim extremists.  And 
20110111024123.000|20110111024125.000|TR0|I always say, I'm not -- I'm not 
20110111024125.000|20110111024128.000|TR0|judgmental, but I am judging.  I'm not 
20110111024128.000|20110111024130.000|TR0|prejudging.  I'm judging.
20110111024130.000|20110111024133.000|TR0|
20110111024133.000|20110111024135.000|TR0|And I'm judging that somebody like that is 
20110111024135.000|20110111024137.000|TR0|a terrorist in our midst.  But it's 
20110111024137.000|20110111024140.000|TR0|interesting you bring this up, because 
20110111024140.000|20110111024142.000|TR0|there are two groups who I can think of 
20110111024142.000|20110111024145.000|TR0|who in recent years that many Americans 
20110111024145.000|20110111024147.000|TR0|have complained do not have enough 
20110111024147.000|20110111024150.000|TR0|moderates.  One is Muslims and one is the 
20110111024150.000|20110111024152.000|TR0|Republicans.  And I think now maybe the 
20110111024152.000|20110111024155.000|TR0|Muslims have more moderates than the 
20110111024155.000|20110111024157.000|TR0|Republicans.
20110111024157.000|20110111024159.000|TR0|
20110111024159.000|20110111024202.000|TR0|You know, when you float terms like 
20110111024202.000|20110111024204.000|TR0|tyranny as they do or treason -- remember 
20110111024204.000|20110111024207.000|TR0|in the health care debate, Republican 
20110111024207.000|20110111024209.000|TR0|congressmen were hoisting that banner that 
20110111024209.000|20110111024212.000|TR0|said "Don't Tread On Me," which really had 
20110111024212.000|20110111024214.000|TR0|only applied to enemies of America, not 
20110111024214.000|20110111024216.000|TR0|political opponents.
20110111024216.000|20110111024219.000|TR0|
20110111024219.000|20110111024221.000|TR0|You create an atmosphere.  Yes, you do.  
20110111024221.000|20110111024224.000|TR0|Governor Perry in -- in Texas threatening 
20110111024224.000|20110111024226.000|TR0|secession over -- over the tax hike that 
20110111024226.000|20110111024229.000|TR0|Obama wanted, over a three percent tax 
20110111024229.000|20110111024231.000|TR0|hike on the richest one percent? That's 
20110111024231.000|20110111024233.000|TR0|reason to throw down the S card?  These 
20110111024233.000|20110111024236.000|TR0|people are hysterical. Hysterical is 
20110111024236.000|20110111024238.000|TR0|really the only word I can think of for it.
20110111024238.000|20110111024241.000|TR0|
20110111024241.000|20110111024243.000|TR0|You know, these conservatives, they want 
20110111024243.000|20110111024246.000|TR0|to be known as tough guys.  They're girls 
20110111024246.000|20110111024248.000|TR0|-- school girls who get hysterical about 
20110111024248.000|20110111024251.000|TR0|things. Health care made them hysterical.  
20110111024251.000|20110111024253.000|TR0|Government takeover.  It wasn't a 
20110111024253.000|20110111024255.000|TR0|government takeover.  I know what a 
20110111024255.000|20110111024258.000|TR0|government takeover would have looked 
20110111024258.000|20110111024300.000|TR0|like.  That's called a single payer 
20110111024300.000|20110111024303.000|TR0|system.  We didn't get that.  We didn't 
20110111024303.000|20110111024305.000|TR0|even try for that.  We didn't even get a 
20110111024305.000|20110111024308.000|TR0|public option.

20110111024310.000|20110111024312.000|TR0|So when you create an atmosphere of 
20110111024312.000|20110111024315.000|TR0|hysteria, yes, of course the nuts are 
20110111024315.000|20110111024317.000|TR0|going to hear it and some of them are 
20110111024317.000|20110111024320.000|TR0|going to do things like this guy did.

20110111024327.000|20110111024330.000|TR0|talking about the political rhetoric 
20110111024330.000|20110111024332.000|TR0|surrounding the tragedy; more on that.  Is 
20110111024332.000|20110111024334.000|TR0|it just rhetoric?  Something we should be 
20110111024334.000|20110111024337.000|TR0|listening for?  More on that ahead.

20110111024347.000|20110111024349.000|TR0|HBO "Real Time with Bill Maher."  Bill, 
20110111024349.000|20110111024351.000|TR0|there are those who say look, it's -- 
20110111024351.000|20110111024354.000|TR0|there's a double standard, that liberals 
20110111024354.000|20110111024356.000|TR0|didn't -- when a kid shot up a school, 
20110111024356.000|20110111024359.000|TR0|some liberals would say, look, it's not 
20110111024359.000|20110111024401.000|TR0|video games that made the kid do it or a 
20110111024401.000|20110111024404.000|TR0|certain type of music, as some 
20110111024404.000|20110111024406.000|TR0|conservatives would say.  Is there -- it 
20110111024406.000|20110111024408.000|TR0|seems like the same people who are saying 
20110111024408.000|20110111024411.000|TR0|if a child shoots up a school, don't blame 
20110111024411.000|20110111024413.000|TR0|the music videos or don't blame the movies 
20110111024413.000|20110111024416.000|TR0|that they watch.  Why is it OK to blame 
20110111024416.000|20110111024418.000|TR0|the political rhetoric?
20110111024418.000|20110111024421.000|TR0|
20110111024421.000|20110111024423.000|TR0|MAHER:  Well, I think they're two 
20110111024423.000|20110111024426.000|TR0|different things.  First of all, I'm not 
20110111024426.000|20110111024428.000|TR0|suggesting -- I don't know if anybody is 
20110111024428.000|20110111024430.000|TR0|suggesting legislating this.  We're not 
20110111024430.000|20110111024433.000|TR0|saying we should curtail anybody's --      
20110111024433.000|20110111024435.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well, there is, though, this 
20110111024435.000|20110111024438.000|TR0|Democratic congressman now who's from 
20110111024438.000|20110111024440.000|TR0|Pennsylvania, I believe, who is suggesting 
20110111024440.000|20110111024443.000|TR0|making speech or symbols that seem to 
20110111024443.000|20110111024445.000|TR0|threaten a member of Congress basically a 
20110111024445.000|20110111024447.000|TR0|federal crime, the same as it is against 
20110111024447.000|20110111024450.000|TR0|the president, which would actually have 
20110111024450.000|20110111024452.000|TR0|-- under his bill, it would outlaw the -- 
20110111024452.000|20110111024455.000|TR0|like the bullet symbols, the bulls eye 
20110111024455.000|20110111024457.000|TR0|symbol.  You're not supporting that?
20110111024457.000|20110111024500.000|TR0|
20110111024500.000|20110111024502.000|TR0|MAHER:  I don't know how far it goes.  We 
20110111024502.000|20110111024504.000|TR0|already have that law. You can't threaten 
20110111024504.000|20110111024507.000|TR0|the president.
20110111024507.000|20110111024509.000|TR0|
20110111024509.000|20110111024512.000|TR0|COOPER:  But you can, I guess -- he's 
20110111024512.000|20110111024514.000|TR0|saying that the same protection that the 
20110111024514.000|20110111024517.000|TR0|president has should be extended to 
20110111024517.000|20110111024519.000|TR0|members of Congress, about verbal threats 
20110111024519.000|20110111024522.000|TR0|or symbolic threats.
20110111024522.000|20110111024524.000|TR0|
20110111024524.000|20110111024526.000|TR0|MAHER:  Yeah, I mean, it would depend on 
20110111024526.000|20110111024529.000|TR0|how the law was worded. But, yeah, there 
20110111024529.000|20110111024531.000|TR0|are infringements on free speech.  We all 
20110111024531.000|20110111024534.000|TR0|know that. And this may be one case where 
20110111024534.000|20110111024536.000|TR0|that would be appropriate.  But I don't 
20110111024536.000|20110111024539.000|TR0|know if the analogy holds with video games.
20110111024539.000|20110111024541.000|TR0|
20110111024541.000|20110111024543.000|TR0|If you're talking about, for example, 
20110111024543.000|20110111024546.000|TR0|after Columbine, we heard a lot about that 
20110111024546.000|20110111024548.000|TR0|happened because they took the Bible out 
20110111024548.000|20110111024551.000|TR0|of the school and because of Marilyn 
20110111024551.000|20110111024553.000|TR0|Manson records and so forth.  Yeah, I 
20110111024553.000|20110111024556.000|TR0|guess that's true.  Anybody can be -- Ozzy 
20110111024556.000|20110111024558.000|TR0|Osbourne I think was blamed at one point.
20110111024558.000|20110111024600.000|TR0|
20110111024600.000|20110111024603.000|TR0|Yes, I mentioned Manson.  I mean, anybody 
20110111024603.000|20110111024605.000|TR0|can get ideas from anywhere.  And you 
20110111024605.000|20110111024608.000|TR0|can't, in a free society, stop ideas from 
20110111024608.000|20110111024610.000|TR0|floating around.  But, again, we're 
20110111024610.000|20110111024613.000|TR0|talking about people who are supposed to 
20110111024613.000|20110111024615.000|TR0|be responsible members of society.  We're 
20110111024615.000|20110111024618.000|TR0|talking about Sarah Palin and Governor 
20110111024618.000|20110111024620.000|TR0|Perry and members of Congress.
20110111024620.000|20110111024622.000|TR0|
20110111024622.000|20110111024625.000|TR0|These are the leaders.  What happened to 
20110111024625.000|20110111024627.000|TR0|the adult supervision? That was my point I 
20110111024627.000|20110111024630.000|TR0|was trying to make before about the 
20110111024630.000|20110111024632.000|TR0|moderates. We're calling on Muslims to 
20110111024632.000|20110111024635.000|TR0|have a moderate presence that would take 
20110111024635.000|20110111024637.000|TR0|care of their extremists.  Where is that 
20110111024637.000|20110111024639.000|TR0|in the Republican party? These adults who 
20110111024639.000|20110111024642.000|TR0|will take care of their extremists?  I 
20110111024642.000|20110111024644.000|TR0|don't see any of it.
20110111024644.000|20110111024647.000|TR0|
20110111024647.000|20110111024649.000|TR0|Because they're owned by that wing.  They 
20110111024649.000|20110111024652.000|TR0|can't insult the gun nuts because that's 
20110111024652.000|20110111024654.000|TR0|who finances their campaigns.  That's 
20110111024654.000|20110111024656.000|TR0|where all the energy, as they would call 
20110111024656.000|20110111024659.000|TR0|it, comes.  That's their base.
20110111024659.000|20110111024701.000|TR0|
20110111024701.000|20110111024704.000|TR0|COOPER:  This young man was apparently 
20110111024704.000|20110111024706.000|TR0|able to buy a gun.  There was an instant 
20110111024706.000|20110111024709.000|TR0|background check.  He passed it.  Should 
20110111024709.000|20110111024711.000|TR0|guns be that available?  Where do you 
20110111024711.000|20110111024714.000|TR0|stand?
20110111024714.000|20110111024716.000|TR0|
20110111024716.000|20110111024718.000|TR0|MAHER:  Of course not.  That's the real 
20110111024718.000|20110111024721.000|TR0|scandal of this, that someone can go into 
20110111024721.000|20110111024723.000|TR0|a sporting goods store and come out with a 
20110111024723.000|20110111024726.000|TR0|gun ten minutes later, someone who is this 
20110111024726.000|20110111024728.000|TR0|unbalanced.  Even people at his college 
20110111024728.000|20110111024731.000|TR0|knew he was crazy and didn't want to be 
20110111024731.000|20110111024733.000|TR0|near him.
20110111024733.000|20110111024735.000|TR0|
20110111024735.000|20110111024738.000|TR0|How about this for a gun check, Google.  
20110111024738.000|20110111024740.000|TR0|Just Google the guy.  In ten minutes, you 
20110111024740.000|20110111024743.000|TR0|could read his rants and get a pretty good 
20110111024743.000|20110111024745.000|TR0|idea where this man was heading.
20110111024745.000|20110111024748.000|TR0|
20110111024748.000|20110111024750.000|TR0|COOPER:  Do you think -- does this say 
20110111024750.000|20110111024752.000|TR0|something about -- about mental health 
20110111024752.000|20110111024755.000|TR0|systems in America, too?  I mean, if -- if 
20110111024755.000|20110111024757.000|TR0|people in his class were so quick to 
20110111024757.000|20110111024800.000|TR0|identify him as someone who had mental 
20110111024800.000|20110111024802.000|TR0|issues, it doesn't seem like he was 
20110111024802.000|20110111024805.000|TR0|getting any help that we know of at this 
20110111024805.000|20110111024807.000|TR0|point.
20110111024807.000|20110111024810.000|TR0|
20110111024810.000|20110111024812.000|TR0|MAHER:  Yes.  I think it says a lot about 
20110111024812.000|20110111024814.000|TR0|small government, which is the thing of 
20110111024814.000|20110111024817.000|TR0|the right, smaller government.  Governor 
20110111024817.000|20110111024819.000|TR0|Brewer in Arizona just cut a lot of money 
20110111024819.000|20110111024822.000|TR0|from health care programs, among them 
20110111024822.000|20110111024824.000|TR0|mental health care program.
20110111024824.000|20110111024827.000|TR0|
20110111024827.000|20110111024829.000|TR0|This is what you get from small 
20110111024829.000|20110111024831.000|TR0|government.  You get someone who is unable 
20110111024831.000|20110111024834.000|TR0|to get readily available health care and 
20110111024834.000|20110111024836.000|TR0|-- and quite easily able to buy a gun.  
20110111024836.000|20110111024839.000|TR0|There's your small government for you.
20110111024839.000|20110111024841.000|TR0|
20110111024841.000|20110111024844.000|TR0|COOPER:  More with Bill Maher right after 
20110111024844.000|20110111024846.000|TR0|the break.
20110111024846.000|20110111024848.000|TR0|
20110111024848.000|20110111024851.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110111024851.000|20110111024853.000|TR0|
20110111024853.000|20110111024856.000|TR0|COOPER:  President Obama and the First 
20110111024856.000|20110111024858.000|TR0|Lady during a moment of silence today in 
20110111024858.000|20110111024901.000|TR0|Washington for the victims of the Tucson 
20110111024901.000|20110111024903.000|TR0|shootings. More now with Bill Maher.
20110111024903.000|20110111024906.000|TR0|
20110111024906.000|20110111024908.000|TR0|Do you think this will change anything?
20110111024908.000|20110111024910.000|TR0|
20110111024910.000|20110111024913.000|TR0|MAHER:  I doubt it.  I mean, we've seen a 
20110111024913.000|20110111024915.000|TR0|number of shootings in the last ten or so 
20110111024915.000|20110111024918.000|TR0|years.  And it never really seems to move 
20110111024918.000|20110111024920.000|TR0|the needle on that debate.  If anything, 
20110111024920.000|20110111024923.000|TR0|it encourages the gun lobby, who should 
20110111024923.000|20110111024925.000|TR0|really be called the assassins lobby, to 
20110111024925.000|20110111024927.000|TR0|rise up before anyone can say anything and 
20110111024927.000|20110111024930.000|TR0|cow everybody into not saying a word about 
20110111024930.000|20110111024932.000|TR0|gun control.
20110111024932.000|20110111024935.000|TR0|
20110111024935.000|20110111024937.000|TR0|In the '90s, at least this was a debate we 
20110111024937.000|20110111024940.000|TR0|used to have.  That all went away, didn't 
20110111024940.000|20110111024942.000|TR0|it, when Al Gore lost Tennessee in the 
20110111024942.000|20110111024944.000|TR0|year 2000.  The NRA won.  Everything on 
20110111024944.000|20110111024947.000|TR0|their checklist is done.  They own the 
20110111024947.000|20110111024949.000|TR0|Republican party.  They own the Supreme 
20110111024949.000|20110111024952.000|TR0|Court.  And they've cowed the Democratic 
20110111024952.000|20110111024954.000|TR0|Party into absolute silence.
20110111024954.000|20110111024957.000|TR0|
20110111024957.000|20110111024959.000|TR0|It would be wonderful if President Obama 
20110111024959.000|20110111025002.000|TR0|or somebody from the other party, the 
20110111025002.000|20110111025004.000|TR0|opposition party, would say something in 
20110111025004.000|20110111025006.000|TR0|support of gun control.  But we don't have 
20110111025006.000|20110111025009.000|TR0|that in this country.  We have two 
20110111025009.000|20110111025011.000|TR0|parties, but we have one position about 
20110111025011.000|20110111025014.000|TR0|guns.  They are great and we just need 
20110111025014.000|20110111025016.000|TR0|more of them.
20110111025016.000|20110111025019.000|TR0|
20110111025019.000|20110111025021.000|TR0|COOPER:  It's interesting.  You only 
20110111025021.000|20110111025023.000|TR0|really hear about gun control from mayors 
20110111025023.000|20110111025026.000|TR0|of cities, like in New York, like in 
20110111025026.000|20110111025028.000|TR0|Chicago.
20110111025028.000|20110111025031.000|TR0|
20110111025031.000|20110111025033.000|TR0|MAHER:  Yeah.
20110111025033.000|20110111025036.000|TR0|
20110111025036.000|20110111025038.000|TR0|COOPER:  And particularly about interstate 
20110111025038.000|20110111025040.000|TR0|commerce and the ability to get a gun in 
20110111025040.000|20110111025043.000|TR0|one state and bring it across to another 
20110111025043.000|20110111025045.000|TR0|state.
20110111025045.000|20110111025048.000|TR0|
20110111025048.000|20110111025050.000|TR0|MAHER:  Yeah, because they see victims 
20110111025050.000|20110111025053.000|TR0|first hand.  Really, a Glock 19, is that 
20110111025053.000|20110111025055.000|TR0|really for hunting?  What else do you hunt 
20110111025055.000|20110111025058.000|TR0|with that except people?  What civilized 
20110111025058.000|20110111025100.000|TR0|society can honestly make the case that 
20110111025100.000|20110111025102.000|TR0|you need these assault weapons and 
20110111025102.000|20110111025105.000|TR0|automatic weapons?  No other country even 
20110111025105.000|20110111025107.000|TR0|considers this.       COOPER:  I'm reading 
20110111025107.000|20110111025110.000|TR0|a biography of Lincoln and Jefferson Davis 
20110111025110.000|20110111025112.000|TR0|right now.  And Lincoln had horrible 
20110111025112.000|20110111025115.000|TR0|things said about him when he was 
20110111025115.000|20110111025117.000|TR0|president.  I mean, really vicious things.
20110111025117.000|20110111025119.000|TR0|
20110111025119.000|20110111025122.000|TR0|MAHER:  And look what happened to him.
20110111025122.000|20110111025124.000|TR0|
20110111025124.000|20110111025127.000|TR0|COOPER:  Well --
20110111025127.000|20110111025129.000|TR0|
20110111025129.000|20110111025132.000|TR0|MAHER:  yeah.  And we saw how that ended.  
20110111025132.000|20110111025134.000|TR0|And, again, let me reiterate: this guy was 
20110111025134.000|20110111025137.000|TR0|a nut.  He probably was going to do 
20110111025137.000|20110111025139.000|TR0|something. But, you know, the people at 
20110111025139.000|20110111025141.000|TR0|his college were afraid of him and thought 
20110111025141.000|20110111025144.000|TR0|-- one of them even said, he's going to 
20110111025144.000|20110111025146.000|TR0|bring in a rifle one day.  I think it's 
20110111025146.000|20110111025149.000|TR0|interesting to note that, at the end of 
20110111025149.000|20110111025151.000|TR0|the day, who he did wind up shooting was a 
20110111025151.000|20110111025154.000|TR0|Democratic officer of the federal 
20110111025154.000|20110111025156.000|TR0|government.
20110111025156.000|20110111025158.000|TR0|
20110111025158.000|20110111025201.000|TR0|COOPER:  You don't think -- you think the 
20110111025201.000|20110111025203.000|TR0|fact that she was a Democrat plays a role 
20110111025203.000|20110111025206.000|TR0|in this?  Because there's no evidence that 
20110111025206.000|20110111025208.000|TR0|he was particularly politically motivated. 
20110111025208.000|20110111025211.000|TR0| People say he wanted to talk more about 
20110111025211.000|20110111025213.000|TR0|philosophy and he wouldn't engage in 
20110111025213.000|20110111025215.000|TR0|political discussions too much.  And 
20110111025215.000|20110111025218.000|TR0|clearly --
20110111025218.000|20110111025220.000|TR0|
20110111025220.000|20110111025223.000|TR0|MAHER:  I don't know -- sorry -- I don't 
20110111025223.000|20110111025225.000|TR0|agree with that.  From the things I've 
20110111025225.000|20110111025228.000|TR0|read, he mentions government being 
20110111025228.000|20110111025230.000|TR0|controlling and too big and government is 
20110111025230.000|20110111025233.000|TR0|this paranoia.  Glenn Beck talks about it 
20110111025233.000|20110111025235.000|TR0|all the time.  Again I'm not saying 
20110111025235.000|20110111025237.000|TR0|they're equivalent.  I'm just saying I 
20110111025237.000|20110111025240.000|TR0|think Glenn Beck is little off, too.  And 
20110111025240.000|20110111025242.000|TR0|--
20110111025242.000|20110111025245.000|TR0|
20110111025245.000|20110111025247.000|TR0|COOPER:  This guy is a registered -- in 
20110111025247.000|20110111025250.000|TR0|order -- the guy is a registered 
20110111025250.000|20110111025252.000|TR0|independent.
20110111025252.000|20110111025254.000|TR0|
20110111025254.000|20110111025257.000|TR0|MAHER:  You're talking about the shooter?
20110111025257.000|20110111025259.000|TR0|
20110111025259.000|20110111025302.000|TR0|COOPER:  The shooter, yeah.
20110111025302.000|20110111025304.000|TR0|
20110111025304.000|20110111025307.000|TR0|MAHER:  Oh.  Well, I mean, again, I'm not 
20110111025307.000|20110111025309.000|TR0|laying -- I'm not saying he was a 
20110111025309.000|20110111025311.000|TR0|Republican operative who was taking his 
20110111025311.000|20110111025314.000|TR0|orders directly from Wasilla.  We're not 
20110111025314.000|20110111025316.000|TR0|making that case.  What we're saying -- 
20110111025316.000|20110111025319.000|TR0|first of all, to answer your question 
20110111025319.000|20110111025321.000|TR0|specifically, I don't think he was all 
20110111025321.000|20110111025324.000|TR0|that apolitical.  Yes, he was all over the 
20110111025324.000|20110111025326.000|TR0|map.  But when you're talking about, you 
20110111025326.000|20110111025329.000|TR0|know, treason and the intrusive big 
20110111025329.000|20110111025331.000|TR0|government is the enemy, and the gold 
20110111025331.000|20110111025333.000|TR0|standard stuff, I'm sorry, but a lot of 
20110111025333.000|20110111025336.000|TR0|this sounds like an afternoon on 
20110111025336.000|20110111025338.000|TR0|right-wing hate radio.
20110111025338.000|20110111025341.000|TR0|

20110111025343.000|20110111025346.000|TR0|with Bill Maher."  After the break we'll 
20110111025346.000|20110111025348.000|TR0|talk again with our political pane, David

20110111025400.000|20110111025403.000|TR0|COOPER:  Welcome back to this special 9:00 
20110111025403.000|20110111025405.000|TR0|edition of 360, the Terror in Tucson.  
20110111025405.000|20110111025407.000|TR0|We're joined again by Dana Loesch, Tea 
20110111025407.000|20110111025410.000|TR0|Party organizer and St. Louis radio host, 
20110111025410.000|20110111025412.000|TR0|and David Gergen, CNN senior political 
20110111025412.000|20110111025415.000|TR0|analyst, and a former presidential adviser.
20110111025415.000|20110111025417.000|TR0|
20110111025417.000|20110111025420.000|TR0|Dana, you heard Bill Maher there.  
20110111025420.000|20110111025422.000|TR0|Obviously very pointed opinions.  What did 
20110111025422.000|20110111025425.000|TR0|you think?
20110111025425.000|20110111025427.000|TR0|
20110111025427.000|20110111025429.000|TR0|LOESCH:  Well, I wasn't -- didn't Bill 
20110111025429.000|20110111025432.000|TR0|Maher -- wasn't he the one who was saying 
20110111025432.000|20110111025434.000|TR0|that said Obama wasn't gangster enough?  
20110111025434.000|20110111025437.000|TR0|I'm curious as to where that speech went.
20110111025437.000|20110111025439.000|TR0|
20110111025439.000|20110111025442.000|TR0|Just a couple of quick thoughts that I got 
20110111025442.000|20110111025444.000|TR0|from listening tot his.  First of all, if 
20110111025444.000|20110111025446.000|TR0|we're going to talk about Arizona gun 
20110111025446.000|20110111025449.000|TR0|laws, let's actually talk about it.  In 
20110111025449.000|20110111025451.000|TR0|Arizona, you can't just give a mentally 
20110111025451.000|20110111025454.000|TR0|ill person a gun.  It's called the 
20110111025454.000|20110111025456.000|TR0|prohibited possessor. It's part of the law.
20110111025456.000|20110111025459.000|TR0|
20110111025459.000|20110111025501.000|TR0|If there's a person who presents a danger 
20110111025501.000|20110111025503.000|TR0|to themselves or someone else, pursuant to 
20110111025503.000|20110111025506.000|TR0|a court order, they can't get a firearm. 
20110111025506.000|20110111025508.000|TR0|So, no, the laws haven't been loosened.
20110111025508.000|20110111025511.000|TR0|
20110111025511.000|20110111025513.000|TR0|Then let's talk about the gun culture as 
20110111025513.000|20110111025516.000|TR0|being respective to just Republicans.  
20110111025516.000|20110111025518.000|TR0|Harry Reid almost won an NRA endorsement 
20110111025518.000|20110111025521.000|TR0|over Sharron Angle in Nevada.  In fact, 
20110111025521.000|20110111025523.000|TR0|the NRA took so much heat for it, it split 
20110111025523.000|20110111025525.000|TR0|conservatives in two.  And it actually 
20110111025525.000|20110111025528.000|TR0|drove a lot of people to leave the NRA for 
20110111025528.000|20110111025530.000|TR0|the Gun Owners of America.  He did photo 
20110111025530.000|20110111025533.000|TR0|ops at a huge gun range in Nevada and --
20110111025533.000|20110111025535.000|TR0|
20110111025535.000|20110111025538.000|TR0|COOPER:  You feel nothing needs to change 
20110111025538.000|20110111025540.000|TR0|in gun laws in the United States?
20110111025540.000|20110111025542.000|TR0|
20110111025542.000|20110111025545.000|TR0|LOESCH:  I think that there needs to be 
20110111025545.000|20110111025547.000|TR0|something different in terms of reporting 
20110111025547.000|20110111025550.000|TR0|people like this instance with Jared Lee 
20110111025550.000|20110111025552.000|TR0|Loughner. If he had been reported, if they 
20110111025552.000|20110111025555.000|TR0|had had a court order, he would not have 
20110111025555.000|20110111025557.000|TR0|been able to go in there.  You don't 
20110111025557.000|20110111025559.000|TR0|change the laws.  You be more alert and 
20110111025559.000|20110111025602.000|TR0|aware.
20110111025602.000|20110111025604.000|TR0|
20110111025604.000|20110111025607.000|TR0|COOPER:  David Gergen, for you, what did 
20110111025607.000|20110111025609.000|TR0|you think?
20110111025609.000|20110111025612.000|TR0|
20110111025612.000|20110111025614.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Well, Anderson, I'm not here to 
20110111025614.000|20110111025617.000|TR0|carry water for conservatives or 
20110111025617.000|20110111025619.000|TR0|Republicans.  But that was so one sided, a 
20110111025619.000|20110111025621.000|TR0|few points have to be made on the other 
20110111025621.000|20110111025624.000|TR0|side.  I'm very much for toughening the 
20110111025624.000|20110111025626.000|TR0|gun laws.  And in fact, the Arizona law 
20110111025626.000|20110111025629.000|TR0|was loosened with regard to concealment.  
20110111025629.000|20110111025631.000|TR0|And Governor Brewer signed that into law.
20110111025631.000|20110111025634.000|TR0|
20110111025634.000|20110111025636.000|TR0|But I also think for Bill Maher to call it 
20110111025636.000|20110111025638.000|TR0|the Assassin's Lobby is pretty deeply 
20110111025638.000|20110111025641.000|TR0|offensive to a whole lot of people.  The 
20110111025641.000|20110111025643.000|TR0|idea that this guy was out on the streets 
20110111025643.000|20110111025646.000|TR0|because we cut back to a small government, 
20110111025646.000|20110111025648.000|TR0|that's not true.  A lot of people today -- 
20110111025648.000|20110111025651.000|TR0|we changed our whole approach to 
20110111025651.000|20110111025653.000|TR0|institutionalization of people who are 
20110111025653.000|20110111025655.000|TR0|mentally unbalanced because we thought it 
20110111025655.000|20110111025658.000|TR0|was oppressive to have so many people 
20110111025658.000|20110111025700.000|TR0|locked up.
20110111025700.000|20110111025703.000|TR0|
20110111025703.000|20110111025705.000|TR0|And there are going to be people walking 
20110111025705.000|20110111025708.000|TR0|around our streets -- they shouldn't have 
20110111025708.000|20110111025710.000|TR0|guns, but there are people walking around 
20110111025710.000|20110111025713.000|TR0|our streets.  As long as they're not 
20110111025713.000|20110111025715.000|TR0|dangerous, we have come to accept that as 
20110111025715.000|20110111025717.000|TR0|a society.
20110111025717.000|20110111025720.000|TR0|
20110111025720.000|20110111025722.000|TR0|But I also thought to paint the 
20110111025722.000|20110111025725.000|TR0|Republicans with a broad brush and say 
20110111025725.000|20110111025727.000|TR0|they're all conservative loonies, in 
20110111025727.000|20110111025730.000|TR0|effect, and where are the moderates?  
20110111025730.000|20110111025732.000|TR0|Where are the adults?  Give me a break.  
20110111025732.000|20110111025734.000|TR0|Come on.  I just think that's unfair.      
20110111025734.000|20110111025737.000|TR0| Back in the '60s, people used to argue 
20110111025737.000|20110111025739.000|TR0|that about the Democratic party when there 
20110111025739.000|20110111025742.000|TR0|was all the unrest in the streets.  There 
20110111025742.000|20110111025744.000|TR0|were a lot of good people who were trying 
20110111025744.000|20110111025747.000|TR0|to tone things down.  There are a lot of 
20110111025747.000|20110111025749.000|TR0|good people in the Republican party who 
20110111025749.000|20110111025751.000|TR0|want to tone things down here as well.
20110111025751.000|20110111025754.000|TR0|
20110111025754.000|20110111025756.000|TR0|COOPER:  Dana, it seems like after 
20110111025756.000|20110111025759.000|TR0|Virginia Tech, schools made a better 
20110111025759.000|20110111025801.000|TR0|effort and a more concerted effort to look 
20110111025801.000|20110111025804.000|TR0|at the mental health of their students.  
20110111025804.000|20110111025806.000|TR0|It seems like the community college in 
20110111025806.000|20110111025809.000|TR0|this case did see this guy -- see the 
20110111025809.000|20110111025811.000|TR0|problem and rectify it.  They got him off 
20110111025811.000|20110111025813.000|TR0|campus.  They got him out of the classroom.
20110111025813.000|20110111025816.000|TR0|
20110111025816.000|20110111025818.000|TR0|But it seems like after that -- and his 
20110111025818.000|20110111025821.000|TR0|parents were notified of that.  They were 
20110111025821.000|20110111025823.000|TR0|in the meeting where they were told he has 
20110111025823.000|20110111025826.000|TR0|mental health issues.  We don't know their 
20110111025826.000|20110111025828.000|TR0|response.  We don't know if they sought 
20110111025828.000|20110111025830.000|TR0|help.  We haven't heard from them.  But it 
20110111025830.000|20110111025833.000|TR0|seems like after the school got out of the 
20110111025833.000|20110111025835.000|TR0|picture, he kind of dropped off the radar.
20110111025835.000|20110111025838.000|TR0|
20110111025838.000|20110111025840.000|TR0|LOESCH:  Right.  I have to say how much I 
20110111025840.000|20110111025843.000|TR0|appreciate Mr. Gergen's comments there.  
20110111025843.000|20110111025845.000|TR0|It was spot on and I agree with everything 
20110111025845.000|20110111025847.000|TR0|he said. I agree.  This is -- the 
20110111025847.000|20110111025850.000|TR0|community college really should have -- 
20110111025850.000|20110111025852.000|TR0|they honestly -- when you have students 
20110111025852.000|20110111025855.000|TR0|that are so terrified of this guy, and 
20110111025855.000|20110111025857.000|TR0|they write about his disruptiveness and 
20110111025857.000|20110111025900.000|TR0|how they are absolutely fearful of him, 
20110111025900.000|20110111025902.000|TR0|and the teacher even had some fear of the 
20110111025902.000|20110111025905.000|TR0|guy -- that should have been reported, 
20110111025905.000|20110111025907.000|TR0|especially when you were all they would 
20110111025907.000|20110111025909.000|TR0|have had to do is --
20110111025909.000|20110111025912.000|TR0|
20110111025912.000|20110111025914.000|TR0|Look, all they would have had to do was 
20110111025914.000|20110111025917.000|TR0|look at him.  They could have looked -- do 
20110111025917.000|20110111025919.000|TR0|a simple Google search.  Look how many 
20110111025919.000|20110111025922.000|TR0|bloggers found that stuff easily.
20110111025922.000|20110111025924.000|TR0|
20110111025924.000|20110111025926.000|TR0|COOPER:  We're out of time.
20110111025926.000|20110111025929.000|TR0|
20110111025929.000|20110111025931.000|TR0|LOESCH:  This would have been found out.
20110111025931.000|20110111025934.000|TR0|
20110111025934.000|20110111025936.000|TR0|COOPER:  We're going to have more with 
20110111025936.000|20110111025939.000|TR0|Dana, more with David Gergen in the 10:00 
20110111025939.000|20110111025941.000|TR0|hour.  Guys, thanks very much.
20110111025941.000|20110111025943.000|TR0|
