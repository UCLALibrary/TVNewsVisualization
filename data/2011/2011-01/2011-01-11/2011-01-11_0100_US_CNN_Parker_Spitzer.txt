20110111010009.000|20110111010012.000|TR0|evening.  I'm Kathleen Parker.
20110111010012.000|20110111010014.000|TR0|
20110111010014.000|20110111010017.000|TR0|ELIOT SPITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm Eliot 
20110111010017.000|20110111010020.000|TR0|Spitzer.  Welcome to the program.
20110111010020.000|20110111010022.000|TR0|
20110111010022.000|20110111010025.000|TR0|Our top story, the shooting tragedy in 
20110111010025.000|20110111010027.000|TR0|Tucson, Arizona.  As facts emerge about 
20110111010027.000|20110111010030.000|TR0|the awful events of Saturday, more and 
20110111010030.000|20110111010033.000|TR0|more questions come up about this man, 
20110111010033.000|20110111010035.000|TR0|perpetrator Jared Loughner.  This is his 
20110111010035.000|20110111010038.000|TR0|mug shot released just hours ago.  Take a 
20110111010038.000|20110111010041.000|TR0|look at him.
20110111010041.000|20110111010043.000|TR0|
20110111010043.000|20110111010046.000|TR0|This man bought a gun legally just a few 
20110111010046.000|20110111010048.000|TR0|months ago.  We may know who he is, but we 
20110111010048.000|20110111010051.000|TR0|still have many questions about his 
20110111010051.000|20110111010054.000|TR0|motives and the political environment in 
20110111010054.000|20110111010056.000|TR0|which the shooting took place.
20110111010056.000|20110111010059.000|TR0|
20110111010059.000|20110111010102.000|TR0|But first, breaking news.  We've just 
20110111010102.000|20110111010104.000|TR0|learned that President Obama will be going 
20110111010104.000|20110111010107.000|TR0|to Tucson on Wednesday.  He'll be 
20110111010107.000|20110111010109.000|TR0|attending a memorial service for the 
20110111010109.000|20110111010112.000|TR0|victims of the shooting.
20110111010112.000|20110111010115.000|TR0|
20110111010115.000|20110111010117.000|TR0|Earlier today, a solemn moment as the 
20110111010117.000|20110111010120.000|TR0|president asked all Americans to observe a 
20110111010120.000|20110111010123.000|TR0|moment of silence for the victims.  Many 
20110111010123.000|20110111010125.000|TR0|are now asking themselves the same 
20110111010125.000|20110111010128.000|TR0|questions that Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110111010128.000|20110111010130.000|TR0|Giffords had been asking just two days 
20110111010130.000|20110111010133.000|TR0|before she was shot.
20110111010133.000|20110111010136.000|TR0|
20110111010136.000|20110111010138.000|TR0|On Friday, she wrote this in an e-mail to 
20110111010138.000|20110111010141.000|TR0|a friend.  And I quote, "I would love to 
20110111010141.000|20110111010144.000|TR0|talk about what we can do to promote 
20110111010144.000|20110111010146.000|TR0|centrism and moderation.  We need to 
20110111010146.000|20110111010149.000|TR0|figure out how to tone our rhetoric and 
20110111010149.000|20110111010151.000|TR0|partisanship down."
20110111010151.000|20110111010154.000|TR0|
20110111010154.000|20110111010157.000|TR0|PARKER:  Before we dig into this and other 
20110111010157.000|20110111010159.000|TR0|issues, here's what we know about the 
20110111010159.000|20110111010202.000|TR0|situation this evening.
20110111010202.000|20110111010205.000|TR0|
20110111010205.000|20110111010207.000|TR0|Jared L. Loughner, the 22-year-old alleged 
20110111010207.000|20110111010210.000|TR0|shooter, appeared before a federal 
20110111010210.000|20110111010212.000|TR0|magistrate judge in Phoenix today, facing 
20110111010212.000|20110111010215.000|TR0|three counts of murder and two counts of 
20110111010215.000|20110111010218.000|TR0|attempted murder in the case.
20110111010218.000|20110111010220.000|TR0|
20110111010220.000|20110111010223.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords remains in 
20110111010223.000|20110111010226.000|TR0|intensive care at Tucson Medical -- 
20110111010226.000|20110111010228.000|TR0|University Medical Center.  Her condition 
20110111010228.000|20110111010231.000|TR0|is essentially unchanged as physicians 
20110111010231.000|20110111010233.000|TR0|watch for any swelling in her brain.
20110111010233.000|20110111010236.000|TR0|
20110111010236.000|20110111010239.000|TR0|Six people were killed in the incident.  
20110111010239.000|20110111010241.000|TR0|Fourteen were injured. Eight patients are 
20110111010241.000|20110111010244.000|TR0|still in the hospital.  Two, including 
20110111010244.000|20110111010247.000|TR0|Giffords, are in intensive care.
20110111010247.000|20110111010249.000|TR0|
20110111010249.000|20110111010252.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And here are the questions we 
20110111010252.000|20110111010254.000|TR0|want to dig into on tonight's show.  Given 
20110111010254.000|20110111010257.000|TR0|that Loughner was suspended from community 
20110111010257.000|20110111010300.000|TR0|college and rejected by the U.S. Army, was 
20110111010300.000|20110111010302.000|TR0|he treated for his evident mental health 
20110111010302.000|20110111010305.000|TR0|issues?
20110111010305.000|20110111010308.000|TR0|
20110111010308.000|20110111010310.000|TR0|We've learned the perpetrator was obsessed 
20110111010310.000|20110111010313.000|TR0|by 9/11 conspiracy theories.  His favorite 
20110111010313.000|20110111010315.000|TR0|books range from the "Communist Manifesto" 
20110111010315.000|20110111010318.000|TR0|to "Mein Kampf".  Given this, what 
20110111010318.000|20110111010321.000|TR0|conclusions can we draw about Loughner's 
20110111010321.000|20110111010323.000|TR0|politics?  And perhaps most importantly, 
20110111010323.000|20110111010326.000|TR0|how was this man able to purchase a semi 
20110111010326.000|20110111010329.000|TR0|automatic pistol and multiple clips of 
20110111010329.000|20110111010331.000|TR0|ammunition?
20110111010331.000|20110111010334.000|TR0|
20110111010334.000|20110111010336.000|TR0|PARKER:  We start with our headliner.  One 
20110111010336.000|20110111010339.000|TR0|of the first to refer to the bitter state 
20110111010339.000|20110111010342.000|TR0|of our politics after the shooting was 
20110111010342.000|20110111010344.000|TR0|Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik.  Take 
20110111010344.000|20110111010347.000|TR0|a listen to what he said about the tragedy.

20110111010355.000|20110111010357.000|TR0|SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK, PIMA COUNTY, 
20110111010357.000|20110111010400.000|TR0|ARIZONA:  When you look at unbalanced 
20110111010400.000|20110111010403.000|TR0|people, how they are -- how they respond 
20110111010403.000|20110111010405.000|TR0|to the vitriol that comes out of certain 
20110111010405.000|20110111010408.000|TR0|mouths about tearing down the government, 
20110111010408.000|20110111010411.000|TR0|the anger, the hatred, the bigotry that 
20110111010411.000|20110111010413.000|TR0|goes on in this country is getting to be 
20110111010413.000|20110111010416.000|TR0|outrageous.
20110111010416.000|20110111010418.000|TR0|
20110111010418.000|20110111010421.000|TR0|And unfortunately, Arizona, I think, has 
20110111010421.000|20110111010424.000|TR0|become sort of the capital.  We have 
20110111010424.000|20110111010426.000|TR0|become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry.
20110111010426.000|20110111010429.000|TR0|

20110111010434.000|20110111010437.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Those comments sparked strong 
20110111010437.000|20110111010439.000|TR0|responses from both ends of the political 
20110111010439.000|20110111010442.000|TR0|spectrum, some condemning the sheriff and 
20110111010442.000|20110111010445.000|TR0|others defending him for speaking his mind.
20110111010445.000|20110111010447.000|TR0|
20110111010447.000|20110111010450.000|TR0|Sheriff Clarence Dupnik joins us tonight 
20110111010450.000|20110111010453.000|TR0|from Tucson.
20110111010453.000|20110111010455.000|TR0|
20110111010455.000|20110111010458.000|TR0|Sheriff, thank you for joining us.
20110111010458.000|20110111010500.000|TR0|
20110111010500.000|20110111010503.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  My pleasure.

20110111010506.000|20110111010508.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, Sheriff, it goes 
20110111010508.000|20110111010511.000|TR0|without saying, conservative radio hosts, 
20110111010511.000|20110111010514.000|TR0|you know specifically Glenn Beck, Rush 
20110111010514.000|20110111010516.000|TR0|Limbaugh, have pounced on your comments.  
20110111010516.000|20110111010519.000|TR0|They have even said that you would almost 
20110111010519.000|20110111010521.000|TR0|prefer to see acquittals in cases using 
20110111010521.000|20110111010524.000|TR0|their own very vitriolic language about 
20110111010524.000|20110111010527.000|TR0|you.
20110111010527.000|20110111010529.000|TR0|
20110111010529.000|20110111010532.000|TR0|Take a listen to what Rush Limbaugh said 
20110111010532.000|20110111010535.000|TR0|earlier today on his show.

20110111010545.000|20110111010548.000|TR0|HOST:  My guess, sheriff wouldn't mind if 
20110111010548.000|20110111010550.000|TR0|the shooter is acquitted.  After all, it's 
20110111010550.000|20110111010553.000|TR0|not the shooter's fault.  If you carry the 
20110111010553.000|20110111010556.000|TR0|sheriff's logic all the way out.
20110111010556.000|20110111010558.000|TR0|
20110111010558.000|20110111010601.000|TR0|Well, what do you mean, HR?  If the 
20110111010601.000|20110111010603.000|TR0|sheriff is going to speculate, I'm going 
20110111010603.000|20110111010606.000|TR0|to speculate.  I mean how does it feel?
20110111010606.000|20110111010609.000|TR0|
20110111010609.000|20110111010611.000|TR0|Hey, Sheriff.  I bet you hope he's 
20110111010611.000|20110111010614.000|TR0|acquitted, right?  What do you know about 
20110111010614.000|20110111010617.000|TR0|him?  I don't know anything.  I just know 
20110111010617.000|20110111010619.000|TR0|how liberals are, Sheriff.  You probably 
20110111010619.000|20110111010622.000|TR0|have a tough time putting the guilty 
20110111010622.000|20110111010624.000|TR0|behind bars because it's always somebody 
20110111010624.000|20110111010627.000|TR0|else's fault.  Right, Sheriff?  It's never 
20110111010627.000|20110111010630.000|TR0|the guilty's fault.  They didn't do it.  
20110111010630.000|20110111010632.000|TR0|Somebody made them do it, right, Sheriff?

20110111010648.000|20110111010651.000|TR0|language and this sort of crazy things he 
20110111010651.000|20110111010653.000|TR0|just said?
20110111010653.000|20110111010656.000|TR0|
20110111010656.000|20110111010659.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  Well, I have actually 52 years in 
20110111010659.000|20110111010701.000|TR0|law enforcement, 30 years as sheriff.  But 
20110111010701.000|20110111010704.000|TR0|it's exactly this kind of personal name- 
20110111010704.000|20110111010706.000|TR0|calling.  He didn't sound like he was 
20110111010706.000|20110111010709.000|TR0|really concerned about me when he was 
20110111010709.000|20110111010712.000|TR0|criticizing and saying things that 
20110111010712.000|20110111010714.000|TR0|absolutely were not true. He knows they're 
20110111010714.000|20110111010717.000|TR0|not true.
20110111010717.000|20110111010720.000|TR0|
20110111010720.000|20110111010722.000|TR0|You know I have a reputation of 50 years.  
20110111010722.000|20110111010725.000|TR0|And I don't think I have to defend myself 
20110111010725.000|20110111010727.000|TR0|on the kinds of issues that he was 
20110111010727.000|20110111010730.000|TR0|raising. It's my belief that the hard 
20110111010730.000|20110111010733.000|TR0|right is deliberately fueling the fire 
20110111010733.000|20110111010735.000|TR0|against public officials, elected 
20110111010735.000|20110111010738.000|TR0|officials, government, and the 
20110111010738.000|20110111010741.000|TR0|administration.
20110111010741.000|20110111010743.000|TR0|
20110111010743.000|20110111010746.000|TR0|Because it -- they think that in some way 
20110111010746.000|20110111010748.000|TR0|-- and maybe they're right -- it benefits 
20110111010748.000|20110111010751.000|TR0|them in the election process.
20110111010751.000|20110111010754.000|TR0|
20110111010754.000|20110111010756.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Sheriff, I don't -- I admire you 
20110111010756.000|20110111010759.000|TR0|and honor you for your 52 years in law 
20110111010759.000|20110111010802.000|TR0|enforcement.  I have many fewer than you.  
20110111010802.000|20110111010804.000|TR0|I had a couple as a prosecutor, as 
20110111010804.000|20110111010807.000|TR0|attorney general.  You talk about voices 
20110111010807.000|20110111010809.000|TR0|on the hard right.
20110111010809.000|20110111010812.000|TR0|
20110111010812.000|20110111010815.000|TR0|About whom are you referring?  Give us 
20110111010815.000|20110111010817.000|TR0|names.  Who do you mean specifically who's 
20110111010817.000|20110111010820.000|TR0|doing that?
20110111010820.000|20110111010823.000|TR0|
20110111010823.000|20110111010825.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  I don't want to get into 
20110111010825.000|20110111010828.000|TR0|name-calling.  You know?  You played one 
20110111010828.000|20110111010830.000|TR0|of the people who is a master at this kind 
20110111010830.000|20110111010833.000|TR0|of diatribe. And he enflames a lot of 
20110111010833.000|20110111010836.000|TR0|people against people like me.  And 
20110111010836.000|20110111010838.000|TR0|against Democrats and liberals and this 
20110111010838.000|20110111010841.000|TR0|benefits the other party.
20110111010841.000|20110111010843.000|TR0|
20110111010843.000|20110111010846.000|TR0|When it comes election time, I think that 
20110111010846.000|20110111010849.000|TR0|they're happy when the people are very 
20110111010849.000|20110111010851.000|TR0|angry at government, period.
20110111010851.000|20110111010854.000|TR0|
20110111010854.000|20110111010857.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Look, I just want to reiterate, 
20110111010857.000|20110111010859.000|TR0|especially since we did in fact, as you 
20110111010859.000|20110111010902.000|TR0|say, played those comments from Rush 
20110111010902.000|20110111010904.000|TR0|Limbaugh that attacked the integrity of 
20110111010904.000|20110111010907.000|TR0|which you pursue your job, I think we 
20110111010907.000|20110111010910.000|TR0|should all honor your role as the sheriff. 
20110111010910.000|20110111010912.000|TR0| Somebody who's responded to this and has, 
20110111010912.000|20110111010915.000|TR0|as you say, 52 years in law enforcement.
20110111010915.000|20110111010918.000|TR0|
20110111010918.000|20110111010920.000|TR0|What do we now know as we move forward in 
20110111010920.000|20110111010923.000|TR0|this investigation about the shooter's 
20110111010923.000|20110111010925.000|TR0|motivations, about his links to political 
20110111010925.000|20110111010928.000|TR0|activism?  Are we learning more about that?
20110111010928.000|20110111010931.000|TR0|
20110111010931.000|20110111010933.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  Well, I think when you get into 
20110111010933.000|20110111010936.000|TR0|the arena of motives, you're -- you're 
20110111010936.000|20110111010939.000|TR0|asking for trouble.  Especially when 
20110111010939.000|20110111010941.000|TR0|you're talking about somebody who's 
20110111010941.000|20110111010944.000|TR0|unbalanced and is very troubled and this 
20110111010944.000|20110111010946.000|TR0|individual certainly fits in that category.
20110111010946.000|20110111010949.000|TR0|
20110111010949.000|20110111010952.000|TR0|It's difficult, if not impossible, and I'm 
20110111010952.000|20110111010954.000|TR0|in the latter, to try to rationalize 
20110111010954.000|20110111010957.000|TR0|irrational behavior.
20110111010957.000|20110111011000.000|TR0|
20110111011000.000|20110111011002.000|TR0|PARKER:  Sheriff, I want to ask you a 
20110111011002.000|20110111011005.000|TR0|couple of things.  First, you know, it's 
20110111011005.000|20110111011007.000|TR0|not my job to defend Rush Limbaugh and I 
20110111011007.000|20110111011010.000|TR0|don't intend to.  I think when we get sort 
20110111011010.000|20110111011013.000|TR0|of carried away with these commentaries we 
20110111011013.000|20110111011015.000|TR0|do sometimes more harm than good 
20110111011015.000|20110111011018.000|TR0|certainly.  And I -- but I do think that 
20110111011018.000|20110111011021.000|TR0|in his case, just now, he was exaggerating.
20110111011021.000|20110111011023.000|TR0|
20110111011023.000|20110111011026.000|TR0|He was using hyperbole to try to show you 
20110111011026.000|20110111011028.000|TR0|what it felt like to be accused of 
20110111011028.000|20110111011031.000|TR0|something of which you were not guilty.  I 
20110111011031.000|20110111011034.000|TR0|think that's what he was doing.  But let 
20110111011034.000|20110111011036.000|TR0|me just --
20110111011036.000|20110111011039.000|TR0|
20110111011039.000|20110111011042.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  Well, I think that he was 
20110111011042.000|20110111011044.000|TR0|enflaming people against me, which -- the 
20110111011044.000|20110111011047.000|TR0|right and people like Rush Limbaugh don't 
20110111011047.000|20110111011049.000|TR0|want to listen to the voice of reason at 
20110111011049.000|20110111011052.000|TR0|all.  They have an agenda.  And they 
20110111011052.000|20110111011055.000|TR0|pursue that and they make a lot of money 
20110111011055.000|20110111011057.000|TR0|at it.
20110111011057.000|20110111011100.000|TR0|
20110111011100.000|20110111011103.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, very clearly it was 
20110111011103.000|20110111011105.000|TR0|directed at you personally. But let me 
20110111011105.000|20110111011108.000|TR0|just say this.  Since you made some of 
20110111011108.000|20110111011110.000|TR0|those comments, your own colleagues in 
20110111011110.000|20110111011113.000|TR0|Arizona have also been critical of you for 
20110111011113.000|20110111011116.000|TR0|speaking out.  Here's what Senator Jon Kyl 
20110111011116.000|20110111011118.000|TR0|had to say.
20110111011118.000|20110111011121.000|TR0|

20110111011126.000|20110111011129.000|TR0|SEN. JON KYL (R), ARIZONA:  I didn't 
20110111011129.000|20110111011131.000|TR0|really think that that had any part in our 
20110111011131.000|20110111011134.000|TR0|law enforcement briefing last night.  It 
20110111011134.000|20110111011137.000|TR0|was speculation.  And I don't think we 
20110111011137.000|20110111011139.000|TR0|should rush to speculate.  We really don't 
20110111011139.000|20110111011142.000|TR0|know what motivated this -- this young 
20110111011142.000|20110111011145.000|TR0|person except to know that he was very 
20110111011145.000|20110111011147.000|TR0|mentally unstable.
20110111011147.000|20110111011150.000|TR0|

20110111011155.000|20110111011158.000|TR0|PARKER:  And one of your fellow Arizona 
20110111011158.000|20110111011200.000|TR0|sheriffs, in fact, Paul Babeu, said it's a 
20110111011200.000|20110111011203.000|TR0|sheriff's job to try to get the facts and 
20110111011203.000|20110111011206.000|TR0|not be part of the problem.
20110111011206.000|20110111011208.000|TR0|
20110111011208.000|20110111011211.000|TR0|And what do you say to Sheriff Babeu?
20110111011211.000|20110111011213.000|TR0|
20110111011213.000|20110111011216.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  Well, I'm not sure what he's 
20110111011216.000|20110111011219.000|TR0|talking about when I'm talking about part 
20110111011219.000|20110111011221.000|TR0|of the problem.  I spoke what I really 
20110111011221.000|20110111011224.000|TR0|believed. And I feel millions of people in 
20110111011224.000|20110111011227.000|TR0|this country believe the same as I have 
20110111011227.000|20110111011229.000|TR0|spoken the last few days.
20110111011229.000|20110111011232.000|TR0|
20110111011232.000|20110111011234.000|TR0|There's no doubt in my mind that based on 
20110111011234.000|20110111011237.000|TR0|the response that we've received that 
20110111011237.000|20110111011240.000|TR0|there are a whole lot of people that are 
20110111011240.000|20110111011242.000|TR0|really upset with the tenor and the 
20110111011242.000|20110111011245.000|TR0|discourse that takes place publicly 
20110111011245.000|20110111011248.000|TR0|amongst our elected officials, our 
20110111011248.000|20110111011250.000|TR0|Congress, and I think basically Congress 
20110111011250.000|20110111011253.000|TR0|is broken.  And people are angry about it, 
20110111011253.000|20110111011255.000|TR0|and they should be. Something, I think, 
20110111011255.000|20110111011258.000|TR0|needs to be done.
20110111011258.000|20110111011301.000|TR0|
20110111011301.000|20110111011303.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, Sheriff, I agree with you 
20110111011303.000|20110111011306.000|TR0|that the rhetoric has become too heated 
20110111011306.000|20110111011309.000|TR0|and as a columnist, I've written about 
20110111011309.000|20110111011311.000|TR0|this for a number of years.  So I share 
20110111011311.000|20110111011314.000|TR0|your concerns.  But let me just ask you 
20110111011314.000|20110111011316.000|TR0|about this specific case.  Do you have any 
20110111011316.000|20110111011319.000|TR0|evidence whatsoever that this was a 
20110111011319.000|20110111011322.000|TR0|politically motivated act or that 
20110111011322.000|20110111011324.000|TR0|rhetoric, indeed, influenced this young 
20110111011324.000|20110111011327.000|TR0|man to do what he did?       DUPNIK:  I 
20110111011327.000|20110111011330.000|TR0|think -- I think Rush Limbaugh knows along 
20110111011330.000|20110111011332.000|TR0|with a lot of other people that we can't 
20110111011332.000|20110111011335.000|TR0|prove what was in this man's heart at the 
20110111011335.000|20110111011337.000|TR0|time of the act.  We can speculate.  
20110111011337.000|20110111011340.000|TR0|Professionals can speculate. But it's my 
20110111011340.000|20110111011343.000|TR0|feeling that the tenor of the country 
20110111011343.000|20110111011345.000|TR0|particularly influences unbalanced, 
20110111011345.000|20110111011348.000|TR0|unstable personalities especially.
20110111011348.000|20110111011351.000|TR0|
20110111011351.000|20110111011353.000|TR0|I think all professional scientists would 
20110111011353.000|20110111011356.000|TR0|agree to that.  And I'm talking in 
20110111011356.000|20110111011358.000|TR0|generalities.  I'm not blaming Rush 
20110111011358.000|20110111011401.000|TR0|Limbaugh specifically, but I'm saying that 
20110111011401.000|20110111011404.000|TR0|people who do this continually 24 hours a 
20110111011404.000|20110111011406.000|TR0|day, seven days a week, and have an 
20110111011406.000|20110111011409.000|TR0|agenda, have a responsibility.
20110111011409.000|20110111011412.000|TR0|
20110111011412.000|20110111011414.000|TR0|They have free speech, but I think with 
20110111011414.000|20110111011417.000|TR0|free speech comes some responsibility.  
20110111011417.000|20110111011419.000|TR0|And there can be consequences.  And I -- I 
20110111011419.000|20110111011422.000|TR0|firmly believe that.
20110111011422.000|20110111011425.000|TR0|
20110111011425.000|20110111011427.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Sheriff, I not only agree with 
20110111011427.000|20110111011430.000|TR0|you, but I applaud the way -- the measured 
20110111011430.000|20110111011433.000|TR0|way in which you are making your points.  
20110111011433.000|20110111011435.000|TR0|I thin it is important for the discourse 
20110111011435.000|20110111011438.000|TR0|in this nation.  Another element of what 
20110111011438.000|20110111011440.000|TR0|has evolved over the last couple of days 
20110111011440.000|20110111011443.000|TR0|of course is that people are kind of 
20110111011443.000|20110111011446.000|TR0|amazed of the fact that an individual who 
20110111011446.000|20110111011448.000|TR0|clearly was unstable, disturbed -- I'm 
20110111011448.000|20110111011451.000|TR0|making judgments now based on evidence. 
20110111011451.000|20110111011454.000|TR0|But clearly he was not looking at the 
20110111011454.000|20110111011456.000|TR0|world normally, was able to walk into a 
20110111011456.000|20110111011459.000|TR0|store, buy a semiautomatic weapon, buy a 
20110111011459.000|20110111011501.000|TR0|clip with 31 bullets. In fact several 
20110111011501.000|20110111011504.000|TR0|clips.
20110111011504.000|20110111011507.000|TR0|
20110111011507.000|20110111011509.000|TR0|Is this an issue we need to address?
20110111011509.000|20110111011512.000|TR0|
20110111011512.000|20110111011515.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  Well, it's almost an impossible 
20110111011515.000|20110111011517.000|TR0|issue, in my judgment, to address.  
20110111011517.000|20110111011520.000|TR0|Because who determines stability?  The law 
20110111011520.000|20110111011522.000|TR0|that -- and this applies anywhere in the 
20110111011522.000|20110111011525.000|TR0|United States, not just Arizona -- says 
20110111011525.000|20110111011528.000|TR0|that you have to be declared mentally 
20110111011528.000|20110111011530.000|TR0|incompetent by a court in order to be 
20110111011530.000|20110111011533.000|TR0|denied a gun.  And this person did not fit 
20110111011533.000|20110111011536.000|TR0|in that category.
20110111011536.000|20110111011538.000|TR0|
20110111011538.000|20110111011541.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And I suppose that is the 
20110111011541.000|20110111011543.000|TR0|question that people are now asking.  
20110111011543.000|20110111011546.000|TR0|Should that threshold be changed?  We have 
20110111011546.000|20110111011549.000|TR0|unfortunately in this nation a litany of 
20110111011549.000|20110111011551.000|TR0|public assassinations is really the only 
20110111011551.000|20110111011554.000|TR0|word we can use from the Kennedys to 
20110111011554.000|20110111011557.000|TR0|Martin Luther King to people like that.  
20110111011557.000|20110111011559.000|TR0|It goes on and on.  Is there something we 
20110111011559.000|20110111011602.000|TR0|can do about this in terms, to people like 
20110111011602.000|20110111011604.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE), it goes on and on through our 
20110111011604.000|20110111011607.000|TR0|history.
20110111011607.000|20110111011610.000|TR0|
20110111011610.000|20110111011612.000|TR0|Is there something we can do about this in 
20110111011612.000|20110111011615.000|TR0|terms of access to guns that you think 
20110111011615.000|20110111011618.000|TR0|would be meaningful?
20110111011618.000|20110111011620.000|TR0|
20110111011620.000|20110111011623.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  My -- my feeling is that the 
20110111011623.000|20110111011625.000|TR0|society is so replete with weapons that it 
20110111011625.000|20110111011628.000|TR0|would be futile to try to prevent this 
20110111011628.000|20110111011631.000|TR0|kind of an incident from occurring based 
20110111011631.000|20110111011633.000|TR0|on denying him a gun.  Guns are everywhere 
20110111011633.000|20110111011636.000|TR0|in great volume.  So I think somebody 
20110111011636.000|20110111011639.000|TR0|who's intent on committing such a heinous 
20110111011639.000|20110111011641.000|TR0|act is going to find a weapon, whether he 
20110111011641.000|20110111011644.000|TR0|has to steal it or buy it.
20110111011644.000|20110111011646.000|TR0|
20110111011646.000|20110111011649.000|TR0|PARKER:  Sheriff, you said in your earlier 
20110111011649.000|20110111011652.000|TR0|comments that your state of Arizona has 
20110111011652.000|20110111011654.000|TR0|become a Mecca for bigotry.  What did you 
20110111011654.000|20110111011657.000|TR0|mean by that?  Why do you think that is, 
20110111011657.000|20110111011700.000|TR0|and what do you think you can do about it? 
20110111011700.000|20110111011702.000|TR0|      DUPNIK:  Well, let me -- I'm not 
20110111011702.000|20110111011705.000|TR0|sure that there's anything I can do about 
20110111011705.000|20110111011707.000|TR0|it.  But let me take you back to last 
20110111011707.000|20110111011710.000|TR0|April when our Senate and our House of 
20110111011710.000|20110111011713.000|TR0|Representatives and our governor decided 
20110111011713.000|20110111011715.000|TR0|to pass Senate Bill 1070, which when it 
20110111011715.000|20110111011718.000|TR0|was initially passed clearly mandated that 
20110111011718.000|20110111011720.000|TR0|police officers on reasonable suspicion 
20110111011720.000|20110111011723.000|TR0|alone should determine the citizenship of 
20110111011723.000|20110111011726.000|TR0|people such as Hispanics.
20110111011726.000|20110111011728.000|TR0|
20110111011728.000|20110111011731.000|TR0|In our state, we have two million legal 
20110111011731.000|20110111011734.000|TR0|Hispanics.  And we have somewhere between 
20110111011734.000|20110111011736.000|TR0|four and 500,000 who are probably illegal. 
20110111011736.000|20110111011739.000|TR0| They also put pressure on police officers 
20110111011739.000|20110111011741.000|TR0|to do that because I've never heard it in 
20110111011741.000|20110111011744.000|TR0|any other law, but in the Arizona law, 
20110111011744.000|20110111011747.000|TR0|they said if any citizen in our state 
20110111011747.000|20110111011749.000|TR0|believed that we weren't enforcing the 
20110111011749.000|20110111011752.000|TR0|law, they could sue us.
20110111011752.000|20110111011755.000|TR0|
20110111011755.000|20110111011757.000|TR0|From my point of view, that kind of 
20110111011757.000|20110111011800.000|TR0|behavior is strictly born in bigotry.
20110111011800.000|20110111011802.000|TR0|
20110111011802.000|20110111011805.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right, Sheriff Dupnik.  Thank 
20110111011805.000|20110111011808.000|TR0|you so much for being with us.  We wish 
20110111011808.000|20110111011810.000|TR0|you the best.
20110111011810.000|20110111011813.000|TR0|
20110111011813.000|20110111011816.000|TR0|DUPNIK:  My pleasure.
20110111011816.000|20110111011818.000|TR0|
20110111011818.000|20110111011821.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Thank you.

20110111011823.000|20110111011826.000|TR0|Up next, why was Loughner expelled from 
20110111011826.000|20110111011829.000|TR0|community college?  And why was someone 
20110111011829.000|20110111011831.000|TR0|with Loughner's behavior issues allowed to 
20110111011831.000|20110111011834.000|TR0|buy a semiautomatic pistol?  We talk to 
20110111011834.000|20110111011837.000|TR0|CNN correspondents Drew Griffin and Susan 
20110111011837.000|20110111011839.000|TR0|Candiotti live from Tucson coming up next.

20110111011847.000|20110111011850.000|TR0|PARKER:  One of our chief focuses tonight, 
20110111011850.000|20110111011852.000|TR0|shooter Jared Loughner's background.
20110111011852.000|20110111011855.000|TR0|
20110111011855.000|20110111011858.000|TR0|CNN correspondent Drew Griffin has been 
20110111011858.000|20110111011900.000|TR0|digging into Loughner's life and history.
20110111011900.000|20110111011903.000|TR0|
20110111011903.000|20110111011905.000|TR0|Welcome, Drew.
20110111011905.000|20110111011908.000|TR0|
20110111011908.000|20110111011911.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Drew, what do we know about some 
20110111011911.000|20110111011913.000|TR0|of the missed signals that might have 
20110111011913.000|20110111011916.000|TR0|prevented this tragedy?
20110111011916.000|20110111011919.000|TR0|
20110111011919.000|20110111011921.000|TR0|DREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I 
20110111011921.000|20110111011924.000|TR0|think, Eliot, we can trace the mental 
20110111011924.000|20110111011926.000|TR0|deterioration back to his junior year in 
20110111011926.000|20110111011929.000|TR0|high school. He was a bright kid in 
20110111011929.000|20110111011932.000|TR0|school.  He played saxophone in the band.  
20110111011932.000|20110111011934.000|TR0|And then his friends say junior year, 
20110111011934.000|20110111011937.000|TR0|things really started to fall apart for 
20110111011937.000|20110111011940.000|TR0|him.  A change in his mood.  He started to 
20110111011940.000|20110111011942.000|TR0|use drugs.  He didn't come back his senior 
20110111011942.000|20110111011945.000|TR0|year.
20110111011945.000|20110111011947.000|TR0|
20110111011947.000|20110111011950.000|TR0|But it was just last summer at Pima County 
20110111011950.000|20110111011953.000|TR0|Community College, where it kind of 
20110111011953.000|20110111011955.000|TR0|manifested itself in a math class.  Five 
20110111011955.000|20110111011958.000|TR0|times, campus police had to be called 
20110111011958.000|20110111012001.000|TR0|because of a disturbance involving Jared 
20110111012001.000|20110111012003.000|TR0|Loughner.
20110111012003.000|20110111012006.000|TR0|
20110111012006.000|20110111012008.000|TR0|One of the kids in class in real time was 
20110111012008.000|20110111012011.000|TR0|writing, this guy scares the crap out of 
20110111012011.000|20110111012014.000|TR0|me.  Outbursts, disturbances, moments of 
20110111012014.000|20110111012016.000|TR0|silence where he wouldn't interact with 
20110111012016.000|20110111012019.000|TR0|anybody else and challenging the teacher, 
20110111012019.000|20110111012022.000|TR0|Ben McGahee.  And this is what Ben told me 
20110111012022.000|20110111012024.000|TR0|he felt about Loughner being in his class.

20110111012035.000|20110111012037.000|TR0|INSTRUCTOR:  This guy was mentally 
20110111012037.000|20110111012040.000|TR0|disturbed.  He was very isolated.  I was 
20110111012040.000|20110111012043.000|TR0|scared of what he could do.  I wasn't 
20110111012043.000|20110111012045.000|TR0|scared of him physically, but I was scared 
20110111012045.000|20110111012048.000|TR0|of him bringing a weapon to class.

20110111012056.000|20110111012058.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  It was that scared feeling that 
20110111012058.000|20110111012101.000|TR0|got him to get the campus police to 
20110111012101.000|20110111012104.000|TR0|actually kick him out of his class.  And 
20110111012104.000|20110111012106.000|TR0|then the school basically took it from 
20110111012106.000|20110111012109.000|TR0|there, Eliot.

20110111012111.000|20110111012114.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, did the -- Drew, did the 
20110111012114.000|20110111012117.000|TR0|school do enough before kicking him out?  
20110111012117.000|20110111012119.000|TR0|Did they ever try to contact the police or 
20110111012119.000|20110111012122.000|TR0|get him any kind of help?
20110111012122.000|20110111012125.000|TR0|
20110111012125.000|20110111012127.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  You know the campus police were 
20110111012127.000|20110111012130.000|TR0|contacted, Kathleen. Let me tell you what 
20110111012130.000|20110111012132.000|TR0|the school did.  They followed their code 
20110111012132.000|20110111012135.000|TR0|of conduct policy and maybe this is a time 
20110111012135.000|20110111012138.000|TR0|to reflect on whether this is, indeed, 
20110111012138.000|20110111012140.000|TR0|enough.
20110111012140.000|20110111012143.000|TR0|
20110111012143.000|20110111012146.000|TR0|They got together a behavioral assessment 
20110111012146.000|20110111012148.000|TR0|committee.  And they looked at this kid 
20110111012148.000|20110111012151.000|TR0|and studied this kid and studied the five 
20110111012151.000|20110111012153.000|TR0|instances and then decided to expel him.  
20110111012153.000|20110111012156.000|TR0|I talked to Dr. Lorraine Morales.  She is 
20110111012156.000|20110111012159.000|TR0|the vice president of student affairs 
20110111012159.000|20110111012201.000|TR0|there.  And they were reluctant to talk 
20110111012201.000|20110111012204.000|TR0|specifically about this case.
20110111012204.000|20110111012207.000|TR0|
20110111012207.000|20110111012209.000|TR0|But here's what she said in defending what 
20110111012209.000|20110111012212.000|TR0|the school did do.

20110111012220.000|20110111012222.000|TR0|LORRAINE MORALES, VP, STUDENT DEVELOPMENT, 
20110111012222.000|20110111012225.000|TR0|PIMA COMMUNITY COLLEGE:  One of the 
20110111012225.000|20110111012228.000|TR0|components that we have in the Student 
20110111012228.000|20110111012230.000|TR0|Code of Conduct is we do have behavior 
20110111012230.000|20110111012233.000|TR0|assessment committee that is put in place. 
20110111012233.000|20110111012235.000|TR0| And that is brought forward -- 
20110111012235.000|20110111012238.000|TR0|recommendations to the committee are 
20110111012238.000|20110111012241.000|TR0|brought forward when there is question 
20110111012241.000|20110111012243.000|TR0|about whether or not there might be some 
20110111012243.000|20110111012246.000|TR0|kind of a -- of a mental illness.
20110111012246.000|20110111012249.000|TR0|
20110111012249.000|20110111012251.000|TR0|We present the information to them and the 
20110111012251.000|20110111012254.000|TR0|psychologist is the one that will advise 
20110111012254.000|20110111012256.000|TR0|us on what the needs are for that student.
20110111012256.000|20110111012259.000|TR0|
20110111012259.000|20110111012302.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Was that done in this case?
20110111012302.000|20110111012304.000|TR0|
20110111012304.000|20110111012307.000|TR0|MORALES:  It is -- it is based on -- on 
20110111012307.000|20110111012310.000|TR0|that recommendation that the student was 
20110111012310.000|20110111012312.000|TR0|requested to have a mental health 
20110111012312.000|20110111012315.000|TR0|clearance.  Yes.
20110111012315.000|20110111012317.000|TR0|
20110111012317.000|20110111012320.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Should there have been or is 
20110111012320.000|20110111012323.000|TR0|there any afterthought now that maybe the 
20110111012323.000|20110111012325.000|TR0|school should have went a step further and 
20110111012325.000|20110111012328.000|TR0|tried to get some kind of a commitment 
20110111012328.000|20110111012331.000|TR0|order against this person?
20110111012331.000|20110111012333.000|TR0|
20110111012333.000|20110111012336.000|TR0|MORALES:  Well, hindsight is always 20/20.

20110111012344.000|20110111012346.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Eliot and Kathleen, keep in mind 
20110111012346.000|20110111012349.000|TR0|there was no overt physical threats being 
20110111012349.000|20110111012352.000|TR0|made by Loughner.  They felt that their 
20110111012352.000|20110111012354.000|TR0|duty was to protect the other classmates 
20110111012354.000|20110111012357.000|TR0|in that campus and by kicking him off the 
20110111012357.000|20110111012359.000|TR0|campus, they felt they had done enough.
20110111012359.000|20110111012402.000|TR0|
20110111012402.000|20110111012405.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Drew, you know, this is 
20110111012405.000|20110111012407.000|TR0|obviously such a careful balance.  The 
20110111012407.000|20110111012410.000|TR0|school needs to protect not only the 
20110111012410.000|20110111012413.000|TR0|students of course but also then, they're 
20110111012413.000|20110111012415.000|TR0|going to say the privacy of the person 
20110111012415.000|20110111012418.000|TR0|they kick out.  But what would it have 
20110111012418.000|20110111012420.000|TR0|taken to get the school to pick up the 
20110111012420.000|20110111012423.000|TR0|phone to the police and say, we've got 
20110111012423.000|20110111012426.000|TR0|somebody who's dangerous? At a certain -- 
20110111012426.000|20110111012428.000|TR0|in a minimum threshold don't let him buy a 
20110111012428.000|20110111012431.000|TR0|gun.
20110111012431.000|20110111012434.000|TR0|
20110111012434.000|20110111012436.000|TR0|What would he have needed to do to get 
20110111012436.000|20110111012439.000|TR0|them to act that way?
20110111012439.000|20110111012441.000|TR0|
20110111012441.000|20110111012444.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Well, I mean, to get him to not 
20110111012444.000|20110111012447.000|TR0|buy a gun, you would have to have a judge 
20110111012447.000|20110111012449.000|TR0|or some court declare him mentally insane. 
20110111012449.000|20110111012452.000|TR0| So that would have been a big step.  I 
20110111012452.000|20110111012455.000|TR0|mean this kid was just a problem 
20110111012455.000|20110111012457.000|TR0|classmate, right?  He wasn't hitting 
20110111012457.000|20110111012500.000|TR0|anybody.  He wasn't bringing guns to 
20110111012500.000|20110111012502.000|TR0|school.  He wasn't saying, I'm going to 
20110111012502.000|20110111012505.000|TR0|come back and kill all of you.
20110111012505.000|20110111012508.000|TR0|
20110111012508.000|20110111012510.000|TR0|So, Eliot, I just don't know what else -- 
20110111012510.000|20110111012513.000|TR0|I mean, obviously every nutjob in America 
20110111012513.000|20110111012516.000|TR0|can't be locked up just because they may 
20110111012516.000|20110111012518.000|TR0|go out and do what Jared Loughner is 
20110111012518.000|20110111012521.000|TR0|suspected of doing.  So, I mean, you want 
20110111012521.000|20110111012523.000|TR0|to say, boy, I wish they did something.  
20110111012523.000|20110111012526.000|TR0|But at what point beyond notifying the 
20110111012526.000|20110111012529.000|TR0|parents, his -- you know, his keepers, 
20110111012529.000|20110111012531.000|TR0|that this guy needs some mental help.  I'm 
20110111012531.000|20110111012534.000|TR0|not sure what else they could do.
20110111012534.000|20110111012537.000|TR0|
20110111012537.000|20110111012539.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, Drew, that was my next 
20110111012539.000|20110111012542.000|TR0|question.  Where were his parents in all 
20110111012542.000|20110111012544.000|TR0|of this even though he is an adult, 
20110111012544.000|20110111012547.000|TR0|obviously?  He clearly needed help, aside 
20110111012547.000|20110111012550.000|TR0|from, you know, protecting the other 
20110111012550.000|20110111012552.000|TR0|students at the college, this was a person 
20110111012552.000|20110111012555.000|TR0|who desperately needs some help.
20110111012555.000|20110111012557.000|TR0|
20110111012557.000|20110111012600.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Kathleen, the parents were 
20110111012600.000|20110111012603.000|TR0|there.  The parents were at the meeting 
20110111012603.000|20110111012605.000|TR0|when the school said, look, your kid can't 
20110111012605.000|20110111012608.000|TR0|come back to this school.  The parents 
20110111012608.000|20110111012611.000|TR0|were involved in the meeting.  The dean, 
20110111012611.000|20110111012613.000|TR0|the police chief of the school, they -- 
20110111012613.000|20110111012616.000|TR0|they were told, you know, we really think 
20110111012616.000|20110111012618.000|TR0|your kid has a problem.
20110111012618.000|20110111012621.000|TR0|
20110111012621.000|20110111012624.000|TR0|I think the next question has to be to the 
20110111012624.000|20110111012626.000|TR0|parents who we haven't heard from yet.  
20110111012626.000|20110111012629.000|TR0|But you're spot on.  And he lived with his 
20110111012629.000|20110111012632.000|TR0|parents. They were his support structure.  
20110111012632.000|20110111012634.000|TR0|It's not like a homeless person being 
20110111012634.000|20110111012637.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) down the street.
20110111012637.000|20110111012639.000|TR0|
20110111012639.000|20110111012642.000|TR0|This kid lived in a support culture of his 
20110111012642.000|20110111012645.000|TR0|parents.  And I guess you have to say 
20110111012645.000|20110111012647.000|TR0|where in society are we going to place the 
20110111012647.000|20110111012650.000|TR0|blame or the onus on people to watch out 
20110111012650.000|20110111012653.000|TR0|for each other?
20110111012653.000|20110111012655.000|TR0|
20110111012655.000|20110111012658.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, of course, Drew, as 
20110111012658.000|20110111012700.000|TR0|the school officials said, in hindsight, 
20110111012700.000|20110111012703.000|TR0|everything is easy.  It's always 20/20.  I 
20110111012703.000|20110111012706.000|TR0|guess the investigation now, and this is 
20110111012706.000|20110111012708.000|TR0|what the prosecutors both the federal and 
20110111012708.000|20110111012711.000|TR0|the state level will be doing, trying to 
20110111012711.000|20110111012714.000|TR0|probe into every one these online contacts 
20110111012714.000|20110111012716.000|TR0|with Web sites, his e-mails, his tweets to 
20110111012716.000|20110111012719.000|TR0|find out what we can discern about what he 
20110111012719.000|20110111012721.000|TR0|was thinking and what depravity really 
20110111012721.000|20110111012724.000|TR0|took him to this absolutely heinous act.
20110111012724.000|20110111012727.000|TR0|
20110111012727.000|20110111012729.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Absolutely.
20110111012729.000|20110111012732.000|TR0|
20110111012732.000|20110111012735.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right.
20110111012735.000|20110111012737.000|TR0|
20110111012737.000|20110111012740.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right.  Drew Griffin, thank 
20110111012740.000|20110111012742.000|TR0|you so much.
20110111012742.000|20110111012745.000|TR0|
20110111012745.000|20110111012748.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Drew Griffin, fantastic 
20110111012748.000|20110111012750.000|TR0|reporting.  Thank you.
20110111012750.000|20110111012753.000|TR0|
20110111012753.000|20110111012756.000|TR0|Now we're going to be talking to Susan 
20110111012756.000|20110111012758.000|TR0|Candiotti who has been tracing how that 
20110111012758.000|20110111012801.000|TR0|gun got into the hands of shooter Jared 
20110111012801.000|20110111012803.000|TR0|Loughner. She joins us now from Tucson.
20110111012803.000|20110111012806.000|TR0|
20110111012806.000|20110111012809.000|TR0|Welcome.
20110111012809.000|20110111012811.000|TR0|
20110111012811.000|20110111012814.000|TR0|SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN NATIONAL 
20110111012814.000|20110111012817.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Hello.
20110111012817.000|20110111012819.000|TR0|
20110111012819.000|20110111012822.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Susan, a lot of eyebrows raised 
20110111012822.000|20110111012824.000|TR0|that Loughner was able to buy this gun.  
20110111012824.000|20110111012827.000|TR0|What can you tell us about that?  And why 
20110111012827.000|20110111012830.000|TR0|wasn't somebody there to say, no, you 
20110111012830.000|20110111012832.000|TR0|can't buy a semiautomatic?
20110111012832.000|20110111012835.000|TR0|
20110111012835.000|20110111012838.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  Well, you know, the reason 
20110111012838.000|20110111012840.000|TR0|that he was able to buy one is that he 
20110111012840.000|20110111012843.000|TR0|passed all required background checks.  
20110111012843.000|20110111012845.000|TR0|Remember, he didn't have any criminal 
20110111012845.000|20110111012848.000|TR0|violations in his past.  And as Drew just 
20110111012848.000|20110111012851.000|TR0|mentioned, he had not been adjudicated as 
20110111012851.000|20110111012853.000|TR0|mentally insane by anyone. And so 
20110111012853.000|20110111012856.000|TR0|therefore, he passed.  He could buy the 
20110111012856.000|20110111012859.000|TR0|gun without any problem.
20110111012859.000|20110111012901.000|TR0|
20110111012901.000|20110111012904.000|TR0|But what's raising the ire of a lot of 
20110111012904.000|20110111012906.000|TR0|people now, they're questioning how easy 
20110111012906.000|20110111012909.000|TR0|it was for him to buy these big-capacity 
20110111012909.000|20110111012912.000|TR0|magazines that fit on to the 
20110111012912.000|20110111012914.000|TR0|semiautomatic.  And that's what allowed 
20110111012914.000|20110111012917.000|TR0|him to get off -- fire off so many shots.  
20110111012917.000|20110111012920.000|TR0|And then try to reload with yet another 
20110111012920.000|20110111012922.000|TR0|high-capacity magazine that holds around 
20110111012922.000|20110111012925.000|TR0|30 rounds or so.
20110111012925.000|20110111012927.000|TR0|
20110111012927.000|20110111012930.000|TR0|And so there's nothing illegal about 
20110111012930.000|20110111012933.000|TR0|buying those.  If you go in to buy 
20110111012933.000|20110111012935.000|TR0|ammunition, you can buy it.  Nothing 
20110111012935.000|20110111012938.000|TR0|prohibits you from doing so, whether it's 
20110111012938.000|20110111012941.000|TR0|bullets or a magazine or anything.
20110111012941.000|20110111012943.000|TR0|
20110111012943.000|20110111012946.000|TR0|So the thing is today, New Jersey 
20110111012946.000|20110111012948.000|TR0|Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg and 
20110111012948.000|20110111012951.000|TR0|New York Democratic Congresswoman Caroline 
20110111012951.000|20110111012954.000|TR0|-- Carolyn, excuse me, McCarthy, who you 
20110111012954.000|20110111012956.000|TR0|remember whose husband was killed on the 
20110111012956.000|20110111012959.000|TR0|Long Island railway by a gunman and her 
20110111012959.000|20110111013002.000|TR0|son was injure, they are now saying that 
20110111013002.000|20110111013004.000|TR0|they would like to reinstitute the federal 
20110111013004.000|20110111013007.000|TR0|ban on the sale and manufacture of these 
20110111013007.000|20110111013009.000|TR0|high-capacity magazines.
20110111013009.000|20110111013012.000|TR0|
20110111013012.000|20110111013015.000|TR0|That was part of the federal assault ban 
20110111013015.000|20110111013017.000|TR0|passed during the Clinton administration 
20110111013017.000|20110111013020.000|TR0|but then expired in 2004 under the Bush 
20110111013020.000|20110111013023.000|TR0|administration.
20110111013023.000|20110111013025.000|TR0|
20110111013025.000|20110111013028.000|TR0|Here's what Lautenberg had to say about it.
20110111013028.000|20110111013030.000|TR0|
20110111013030.000|20110111013033.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
20110111013033.000|20110111013036.000|TR0|
20110111013036.000|20110111013038.000|TR0|SEN. FRANK LAUTENBERG (D), NEW JERSEY:  I 
20110111013038.000|20110111013041.000|TR0|think if we just looked at it from a 
20110111013041.000|20110111013044.000|TR0|numerical standpoint that there are less 
20110111013044.000|20110111013046.000|TR0|bullets flying, there's less people going 
20110111013046.000|20110111013049.000|TR0|to get hurt.  And that's what should 
20110111013049.000|20110111013051.000|TR0|happen. There is no reason that people 
20110111013051.000|20110111013054.000|TR0|have to have these large magazine clips 
20110111013054.000|20110111013057.000|TR0|for social or recreational activities.  I 
20110111013057.000|20110111013059.000|TR0|think it's an invitation to disaster.

20110111013107.000|20110111013110.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  But, you know, I spent the day 
20110111013110.000|20110111013112.000|TR0|talking to a lot of gun rights activists.  
20110111013112.000|20110111013115.000|TR0|And they're saying that they find it 
20110111013115.000|20110111013118.000|TR0|shameful, in their words, that some 
20110111013118.000|20110111013120.000|TR0|politicians are -- in their words -- 
20110111013120.000|20110111013123.000|TR0|trying to make political hay out of this 
20110111013123.000|20110111013126.000|TR0|tragedy by talking about reinstituting 
20110111013126.000|20110111013128.000|TR0|this kind of ban on these big-capacity 
20110111013128.000|20110111013131.000|TR0|magazines.
20110111013131.000|20110111013133.000|TR0|
20110111013133.000|20110111013136.000|TR0|And here's what one gun shop owner said.
20110111013136.000|20110111013139.000|TR0|

20110111013141.000|20110111013144.000|TR0|
20110111013144.000|20110111013147.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're not made just 
20110111013147.000|20110111013149.000|TR0|to kill people. They're made to be 
20110111013149.000|20110111013152.000|TR0|enjoyed.  The day they blame an automobile 
20110111013152.000|20110111013154.000|TR0|for an accident that kills an individual 
20110111013154.000|20110111013157.000|TR0|and not blame the driver, then I'll say 
20110111013157.000|20110111013200.000|TR0|they've got a point.  But they always 
20110111013200.000|20110111013202.000|TR0|blame the gun in the case of a horrendous 
20110111013202.000|20110111013205.000|TR0|accident that just happened this past 
20110111013205.000|20110111013208.000|TR0|weekend.

20110111013213.000|20110111013215.000|TR0|
20110111013215.000|20110111013218.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  So who knows.  It looks like 
20110111013218.000|20110111013221.000|TR0|we could get a real battle royale coming 
20110111013221.000|20110111013223.000|TR0|up after this proposal is made.  We'll 
20110111013223.000|20110111013226.000|TR0|have to see what happens.  And what's 
20110111013226.000|20110111013229.000|TR0|ironic sort of in all of this, you know, 
20110111013229.000|20110111013231.000|TR0|Eliot and Kathleen, is that the 
20110111013231.000|20110111013234.000|TR0|congresswoman here who is shot is actually 
20110111013234.000|20110111013236.000|TR0|considered a moderate when it comes to gun 
20110111013236.000|20110111013239.000|TR0|rights.  In fact, she owns guns.
20110111013239.000|20110111013242.000|TR0|
20110111013242.000|20110111013244.000|TR0|And so, you know, if only we could see how 
20110111013244.000|20110111013247.000|TR0|-- what she feels about this.  It's 
20110111013247.000|20110111013250.000|TR0|obviously not the right time to ask.  We 
20110111013250.000|20110111013252.000|TR0|can't.  And we tried to talk to her staff 
20110111013252.000|20110111013255.000|TR0|about it as well today, but they said 
20110111013255.000|20110111013257.000|TR0|they'd have to do more research and look 
20110111013257.000|20110111013300.000|TR0|into it and then get back to us.
20110111013300.000|20110111013303.000|TR0|
20110111013303.000|20110111013305.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, Susan, this is a debate we 
20110111013305.000|20110111013308.000|TR0|have every time there's an incident like 
20110111013308.000|20110111013311.000|TR0|this.  But going back to the question of 
20110111013311.000|20110111013313.000|TR0|buying this ammunition, my understanding 
20110111013313.000|20110111013316.000|TR0|is that the gunman went to a Wal-Mart and 
20110111013316.000|20110111013318.000|TR0|was -- and a sales person refused to sell 
20110111013318.000|20110111013321.000|TR0|him any ammunition because his behavior 
20110111013321.000|20110111013324.000|TR0|was weird.  And then he went to another 
20110111013324.000|20110111013326.000|TR0|Wal-Mart and was able to get what he 
20110111013326.000|20110111013329.000|TR0|needed.
20110111013329.000|20110111013332.000|TR0|
20110111013332.000|20110111013334.000|TR0|Where in there was there -- was there ever 
20110111013334.000|20110111013337.000|TR0|a thought -- does anyone talk to the 
20110111013337.000|20110111013339.000|TR0|Wal-Mart sales person, the first one, and 
20110111013339.000|20110111013342.000|TR0|did that person try to notify authorities 
20110111013342.000|20110111013345.000|TR0|that this fellow was odd and trying to buy 
20110111013345.000|20110111013347.000|TR0|ammunition?

20110111013350.000|20110111013353.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  You know, as that information 
20110111013353.000|20110111013355.000|TR0|was first reported by other news 
20110111013355.000|20110111013358.000|TR0|organizations, now turns out that that was 
20110111013358.000|20110111013400.000|TR0|incorrect.  What happened was -- that we 
20110111013400.000|20110111013403.000|TR0|have heard on background is that this 
20110111013403.000|20110111013406.000|TR0|person -- that he came in to buy it, asked 
20110111013406.000|20110111013408.000|TR0|for it.  When the sales clerk went back to 
20110111013408.000|20110111013411.000|TR0|-- went back to get the bullets and came 
20110111013411.000|20110111013413.000|TR0|back, he was gone. So there wasn't any -- 
20110111013413.000|20110111013416.000|TR0|there was no truth to the fact that he --
20110111013416.000|20110111013419.000|TR0|
20110111013419.000|20110111013421.000|TR0|PARKER:  OK.       CANDIOTTI:  Of some 
20110111013421.000|20110111013424.000|TR0|reports rather that he was acting 
20110111013424.000|20110111013427.000|TR0|strangely.
20110111013427.000|20110111013429.000|TR0|
20110111013429.000|20110111013432.000|TR0|PARKER:  I got you.  So that was not --
20110111013432.000|20110111013434.000|TR0|
20110111013434.000|20110111013437.000|TR0|CANDIOTTI:  But the fact of the matter is, 
20110111013437.000|20110111013440.000|TR0|like, we keep hearing that's right.  You 
20110111013440.000|20110111013442.000|TR0|know, it's the propellant that is 
20110111013442.000|20110111013445.000|TR0|restricted by law.  The gun.  Not the 
20110111013445.000|20110111013448.000|TR0|bullets.  Anyone can go in and buy bullets.

20110111013503.000|20110111013506.000|TR0|Coast tonight, closing airports, dumping 
20110111013506.000|20110111013509.000|TR0|snow and leaving a trail of chaos in its 
20110111013509.000|20110111013511.000|TR0|wake.  We'll take you to one of the

20110111013524.000|20110111013527.000|TR0|SPITZER:  A rare winter storm is wreaking 
20110111013527.000|20110111013530.000|TR0|havoc in the southeast. Louisiana, 
20110111013530.000|20110111013532.000|TR0|Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas have 
20110111013532.000|20110111013535.000|TR0|all declared states of emergency.  Several 
20110111013535.000|20110111013537.000|TR0|inches of snow fell this weekend, and now 
20110111013537.000|20110111013540.000|TR0|freezing rain and sleet have brought most 
20110111013540.000|20110111013543.000|TR0|of the southeast to a standstill.

20110111013545.000|20110111013548.000|TR0|PARKER:  The icy roads have caused 
20110111013548.000|20110111013551.000|TR0|accidents across the region with 
20110111013551.000|20110111013553.000|TR0|fatalities reported in Mississippi and 
20110111013553.000|20110111013556.000|TR0|Alabama.  Hundreds of flights have been 
20110111013556.000|20110111013558.000|TR0|canceled, stranding travelers.  Martin 
20110111013558.000|20110111013601.000|TR0|Savidge is at the normally busy 
20110111013601.000|20110111013604.000|TR0|Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta.  
20110111013604.000|20110111013606.000|TR0|Martin, what's going on there?
20110111013606.000|20110111013609.000|TR0|
20110111013609.000|20110111013612.000|TR0|MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  
20110111013612.000|20110111013614.000|TR0|Kathleen and Eliot, the Atlanta 
20110111013614.000|20110111013617.000|TR0|Hartsfield-Jackson airport has been the 
20110111013617.000|20110111013619.000|TR0|epicenter of misery if you're part of the 
20110111013619.000|20110111013622.000|TR0|flying public today.  But here, look at 
20110111013622.000|20110111013625.000|TR0|the image now.  The lines are actually 
20110111013625.000|20110111013627.000|TR0|much, much less than they were when we 
20110111013627.000|20110111013630.000|TR0|first got here in the day.  That's not 
20110111013630.000|20110111013633.000|TR0|necessarily a good thing. Because what 
20110111013633.000|20110111013635.000|TR0|that actually means is that not that 
20110111013635.000|20110111013638.000|TR0|passengers have gone anywhere, they've 
20110111013638.000|20110111013640.000|TR0|been rebooking but they haven't been 
20110111013640.000|20110111013643.000|TR0|re-flying. Most of them have probably gone 
20110111013643.000|20110111013646.000|TR0|off to their hotels.
20110111013646.000|20110111013648.000|TR0|
20110111013648.000|20110111013651.000|TR0|Now, AirTran says it will resume 
20110111013651.000|20110111013654.000|TR0|operations tomorrow.  It had no flights 
20110111013654.000|20110111013656.000|TR0|today.  Delta canceled about 1,450, I 
20110111013656.000|20110111013659.000|TR0|believe.  But the international flights 
20110111013659.000|20110111013701.000|TR0|are starting to go this evening, which 
20110111013701.000|20110111013704.000|TR0|brings me to Ron Faucet.  He's come to say 
20110111013704.000|20110111013707.000|TR0|goodbye to his son to send him overseas, 
20110111013707.000|20110111013709.000|TR0|but it wasn't the flying that's the 
20110111013709.000|20110111013712.000|TR0|problem.  It was the roads.
20110111013712.000|20110111013715.000|TR0|
20110111013715.000|20110111013717.000|TR0|RON FAUCET:  Yes.  About seven hours from 
20110111013717.000|20110111013720.000|TR0|Nashville, a little over seven hours.
20110111013720.000|20110111013722.000|TR0|
20110111013722.000|20110111013725.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  And that drive normally would 
20110111013725.000|20110111013728.000|TR0|take how long?
20110111013728.000|20110111013730.000|TR0|
20110111013730.000|20110111013733.000|TR0|FAUCET:  About four, a little over four.
20110111013733.000|20110111013736.000|TR0|
20110111013736.000|20110111013738.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  And what did you see along that 
20110111013738.000|20110111013741.000|TR0|road?
20110111013741.000|20110111013743.000|TR0|
20110111013743.000|20110111013746.000|TR0|FAUCET:  Accidents, cars along the side of 
20110111013746.000|20110111013749.000|TR0|the road, a semi pile- up.  Cars all over 
20110111013749.000|20110111013751.000|TR0|the place.
20110111013751.000|20110111013754.000|TR0|
20110111013754.000|20110111013757.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  And we should point out that Ron 
20110111013757.000|20110111013759.000|TR0|is actually accustomed to this kind of 
20110111013759.000|20110111013802.000|TR0|weather, aren't you?
20110111013802.000|20110111013804.000|TR0|
20110111013804.000|20110111013807.000|TR0|FAUCET:  Yes, I'm from Wisconsin.  Slow 
20110111013807.000|20110111013810.000|TR0|and steady kind of gets you down there.
20110111013810.000|20110111013812.000|TR0|
20110111013812.000|20110111013815.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  Yes.  Well, thanks very much.  
20110111013815.000|20110111013818.000|TR0|Good luck to you.  Good luck to your son.
20110111013818.000|20110111013820.000|TR0|
20110111013820.000|20110111013823.000|TR0|FAUCET:  Thank you.

20110111013825.000|20110111013828.000|TR0|SAVIDGE:  Slow and steady are Ron's words. 
20110111013828.000|20110111013831.000|TR0| It was also pretty much slow and steady 
20110111013831.000|20110111013833.000|TR0|in line.  Many have waited hours just to 
20110111013833.000|20110111013836.000|TR0|rebook -- Eliot and Kathleen.

20110111013913.000|20110111013915.000|TR0|the Tucson tragedy.  We'll ask former

20110111013934.000|20110111013936.000|TR0|were quick to blame extremist voices in

20110111014018.000|20110111014021.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Since then, two distinct 
20110111014021.000|20110111014024.000|TR0|narratives have emerged.  One says the

20110111014026.000|20110111014029.000|TR0|The other says this was the act of a loner 
20110111014029.000|20110111014031.000|TR0|on the fringe without a political motive.  
20110111014031.000|20110111014034.000|TR0|At this point, there's no proof of either 
20110111014034.000|20110111014037.000|TR0|theory.  What is clear is the political 
20110111014037.000|20110111014039.000|TR0|rhetoric has gotten heated over the past

20110111014042.000|20110111014045.000|TR0|
20110111014045.000|20110111014047.000|TR0|PARKER:  Tonight we'll try to thoughtfully 
20110111014047.000|20110111014050.000|TR0|debate the tone of our nation's political 
20110111014050.000|20110111014052.000|TR0|discourse.  And joining us now, former 
20110111014052.000|20110111014055.000|TR0|Senator Gary Hart, a scholar and resident 
20110111014055.000|20110111014058.000|TR0|at the University of Colorado, and in Los 
20110111014058.000|20110111014100.000|TR0|Angeles, CNN's senior political analyst 
20110111014100.000|20110111014103.000|TR0|David Gergen.
20110111014103.000|20110111014106.000|TR0|
20110111014106.000|20110111014108.000|TR0|Welcome to you both, gentlemen.
20110111014108.000|20110111014111.000|TR0|
20110111014111.000|20110111014113.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL 
20110111014113.000|20110111014116.000|TR0|ANALYST:  Thank you.
20110111014116.000|20110111014119.000|TR0|
20110111014119.000|20110111014121.000|TR0|GARY HART, FORMER U.S. SENATOR:  Thank you.
20110111014121.000|20110111014124.000|TR0|
20110111014124.000|20110111014127.000|TR0|PARKER:  Senator Hart, we want to start 
20110111014127.000|20110111014129.000|TR0|with you.  You say that the shootings were 
20110111014129.000|20110111014132.000|TR0|a result of current political rhetoric, 
20110111014132.000|20110111014134.000|TR0|that words have consequences and that 
20110111014134.000|20110111014137.000|TR0|those with a megaphone have 
20110111014137.000|20110111014140.000|TR0|responsibilities.  And you wrote on "The 
20110111014140.000|20110111014142.000|TR0|Huffington Post" of the dangers of words 
20110111014142.000|20110111014145.000|TR0|such as "targeted," "in the crosshairs," 
20110111014145.000|20110111014148.000|TR0|eliminated" or "enemies." You were talking 
20110111014148.000|20110111014150.000|TR0|about Sarah Palin, right?
20110111014150.000|20110111014153.000|TR0|
20110111014153.000|20110111014155.000|TR0|HART:  No, I was talking about a whole 
20110111014155.000|20110111014158.000|TR0|range of people that have fundamentally 
20110111014158.000|20110111014201.000|TR0|changed the political dialogue in this 
20110111014201.000|20110111014203.000|TR0|country.  I believe someone who's been 
20110111014203.000|20110111014206.000|TR0|around like Mr. Gergen would agree that it 
20110111014206.000|20110111014209.000|TR0|didn't used to be this way.  After I 
20110111014209.000|20110111014211.000|TR0|posted the blog and comments came in, I 
20110111014211.000|20110111014214.000|TR0|was amazed at the number of people who 
20110111014214.000|20110111014216.000|TR0|said, well, this is just politics as 
20110111014216.000|20110111014219.000|TR0|usual.  It is not politics as usual.
20110111014219.000|20110111014222.000|TR0|
20110111014222.000|20110111014224.000|TR0|I served in a time when people did not 
20110111014224.000|20110111014227.000|TR0|treat each other the way people in 
20110111014227.000|20110111014230.000|TR0|politics and in government are being 
20110111014230.000|20110111014232.000|TR0|treated, treating each other and being 
20110111014232.000|20110111014235.000|TR0|treated today.  And there is no use 
20110111014235.000|20110111014237.000|TR0|whatsoever for these military and 
20110111014237.000|20110111014240.000|TR0|violence-related metaphors to be used in 
20110111014240.000|20110111014243.000|TR0|political discourse.
20110111014243.000|20110111014245.000|TR0|
20110111014245.000|20110111014248.000|TR0|SPITZER:  David, what is your perspective?
20110111014248.000|20110111014250.000|TR0|
20110111014250.000|20110111014253.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Well, I start with the 
20110111014253.000|20110111014256.000|TR0|proposition that Gary Hart is absolutely 
20110111014256.000|20110111014258.000|TR0|right about the deterioration in our 
20110111014258.000|20110111014301.000|TR0|discourse.  And when he was in the Senate, 
20110111014301.000|20110111014304.000|TR0|he brought a loftiness to it and he raised 
20110111014304.000|20110111014306.000|TR0|the level.  He was one of the people I 
20110111014306.000|20110111014309.000|TR0|think who was more thoughtful.  But I 
20110111014309.000|20110111014311.000|TR0|think it has declined a great deal since 
20110111014311.000|20110111014314.000|TR0|he left.  But both sides have been 
20110111014314.000|20110111014317.000|TR0|responsible for heating this up over the 
20110111014317.000|20110111014319.000|TR0|last 10 or 15 years.  I don't think it's 
20110111014319.000|20110111014322.000|TR0|the last two years.  I do think Gary and I 
20110111014322.000|20110111014325.000|TR0|part company about whether this is -- what 
20110111014325.000|20110111014327.000|TR0|we see -- what we've seen in Tucson can be 
20110111014327.000|20110111014330.000|TR0|said to be a consequence of this 
20110111014330.000|20110111014332.000|TR0|overheated and I think poisonous rhetoric.
20110111014332.000|20110111014335.000|TR0|
20110111014335.000|20110111014338.000|TR0|PARKER:  I want to be real clear that I 
20110111014338.000|20110111014340.000|TR0|don't think Sarah Palin deserves the blame 
20110111014340.000|20110111014343.000|TR0|that she has been given, awarded for this. 
20110111014343.000|20110111014346.000|TR0| Because I don't -- first of all, I don't 
20110111014346.000|20110111014348.000|TR0|think we have a causal effect here between 
20110111014348.000|20110111014351.000|TR0|heated rhetoric and what happened.  I 
20110111014351.000|20110111014353.000|TR0|think we have a lone crazy person.  That 
20110111014353.000|20110111014356.000|TR0|said, you know, there's no question that 
20110111014356.000|20110111014359.000|TR0|the rhetoric has become increasingly 
20110111014359.000|20110111014401.000|TR0|hostile.  And -- but I want to ask Senator 
20110111014401.000|20110111014404.000|TR0|Hart, you know, when we talk about these 
20110111014404.000|20110111014407.000|TR0|metaphors such as targeting a candidate 
20110111014407.000|20110111014409.000|TR0|and putting someone in the crosshairs to 
20110111014409.000|20110111014412.000|TR0|eliminate from the next election, you 
20110111014412.000|20110111014414.000|TR0|know, when does that become improper?  And 
20110111014414.000|20110111014417.000|TR0|what's your answer to that?
20110111014417.000|20110111014420.000|TR0|
20110111014420.000|20110111014422.000|TR0|HART:  I think each individual who has a 
20110111014422.000|20110111014425.000|TR0|megaphone, either by virtue of being 
20110111014425.000|20110111014428.000|TR0|elected or having access a microphone has 
20110111014428.000|20110111014430.000|TR0|a responsibility to the democracy and to 
20110111014430.000|20110111014433.000|TR0|this country.  And when it -- when we get 
20110111014433.000|20110111014435.000|TR0|the campaigns where people are invited to 
20110111014435.000|20110111014438.000|TR0|bring their guns and shoot them as a 
20110111014438.000|20110111014441.000|TR0|demonstration of opposition to one's 
20110111014441.000|20110111014443.000|TR0|political opponent and maps are put on 
20110111014443.000|20110111014446.000|TR0|television -- I mean, I'm not naming any 
20110111014446.000|20110111014449.000|TR0|names.  But those who put -- put 
20110111014449.000|20110111014451.000|TR0|candidates in crosshairs, I don't care who 
20110111014451.000|20110111014454.000|TR0|they are, liberal or conservative, is 
20110111014454.000|20110111014456.000|TR0|inflaming deranged and demented people.
20110111014456.000|20110111014459.000|TR0|
20110111014459.000|20110111014502.000|TR0|GERGEN:  The fact is we don't know why 
20110111014502.000|20110111014504.000|TR0|this man acted.  We have no hard evidence. 
20110111014504.000|20110111014507.000|TR0| And it seems to me absent that hard 
20110111014507.000|20110111014510.000|TR0|evidence, it is inappropriate to blame the 
20110111014510.000|20110111014512.000|TR0|political rhetoric, especially on the 
20110111014512.000|20110111014515.000|TR0|right, especially from Sarah Palin or 
20110111014515.000|20110111014517.000|TR0|Glenn Beck or anybody else for what 
20110111014517.000|20110111014520.000|TR0|happened in Tucson.  There is a real 
20110111014520.000|20110111014523.000|TR0|problem with that rhetoric anyway that we 
20110111014523.000|20110111014525.000|TR0|need to deal with, but to blame Tucson on 
20110111014525.000|20110111014528.000|TR0|that I think is inappropriate.  I think it 
20110111014528.000|20110111014531.000|TR0|further polarizes us.
20110111014531.000|20110111014533.000|TR0|
20110111014533.000|20110111014536.000|TR0|We don't just have the politics of 
20110111014536.000|20110111014538.000|TR0|violence.  We have a culture of violence.  
20110111014538.000|20110111014541.000|TR0|This young man could have been heavily 
20110111014541.000|20110111014544.000|TR0|influenced by movies, by television.  
20110111014544.000|20110111014546.000|TR0|There are people who are appearing now in 
20110111014546.000|20110111014549.000|TR0|our media networks, network that carry a 
20110111014549.000|20110111014552.000|TR0|lot of violence say it's political 
20110111014552.000|20110111014554.000|TR0|rhetoric.  Well, I'm sorry.  Those same 
20110111014554.000|20110111014557.000|TR0|networks are carrying a lot of stuff that 
20110111014557.000|20110111014559.000|TR0|could well have been the source.  The fact 
20110111014559.000|20110111014602.000|TR0|is we don't know.  Until we do know, I 
20110111014602.000|20110111014605.000|TR0|think what we ought to do is cool the 
20110111014605.000|20110111014607.000|TR0|accusations.
20110111014607.000|20110111014610.000|TR0|
20110111014610.000|20110111014613.000|TR0|HART:  On my blog and today, I have not 
20110111014613.000|20110111014615.000|TR0|blamed anyone.  I have said and will 
20110111014615.000|20110111014618.000|TR0|continue to say that the use of certain 
20110111014618.000|20110111014620.000|TR0|military and violent rhetoric can lead to 
20110111014620.000|20110111014623.000|TR0|violence.  And I will stick with that 
20110111014623.000|20110111014626.000|TR0|position.
20110111014626.000|20110111014628.000|TR0|
20110111014628.000|20110111014631.000|TR0|I think it would be nice if we heard from 
20110111014631.000|20110111014634.000|TR0|some network owners who are reaping 
20110111014634.000|20110111014636.000|TR0|profits and benefits from heated rhetoric 
20110111014636.000|20110111014639.000|TR0|on their radio and television networks to 
20110111014639.000|20110111014641.000|TR0|say we're encouraging all of our speakers, 
20110111014641.000|20110111014644.000|TR0|talk show hosts and so forth, to tone it 
20110111014644.000|20110111014647.000|TR0|down.  Things are getting out of hand.  I 
20110111014647.000|20110111014649.000|TR0|haven't heard one media executive -- I'm 
20110111014649.000|20110111014652.000|TR0|sure they have spoken out, but I haven't 
20110111014652.000|20110111014655.000|TR0|heard them, that take responsibility.  All 
20110111014655.000|20110111014657.000|TR0|I was trying to say is if you have an 
20110111014657.000|20110111014700.000|TR0|ability to communicate, it carries with it 
20110111014700.000|20110111014702.000|TR0|responsibility.  It's that simple.
20110111014702.000|20110111014705.000|TR0|
20110111014705.000|20110111014708.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, it's that simple if only 
20110111014708.000|20110111014710.000|TR0|people are willing to participate.  And I 
20110111014710.000|20110111014713.000|TR0|think as you both have said, it has to be 
20110111014713.000|20110111014716.000|TR0|a voluntary response from the community at 
20110111014716.000|20110111014718.000|TR0|large.  Media certainly have a big role to 
20110111014718.000|20110111014721.000|TR0|play, as do politicians.  We seem to be 
20110111014721.000|20110111014723.000|TR0|sort of cyclically outraged and, you know, 
20110111014723.000|20110111014726.000|TR0|we tend to forget very quickly.  So the 
20110111014726.000|20110111014729.000|TR0|question is how we keep this in the 
20110111014729.000|20110111014731.000|TR0|forefront of people's minds. David?
20110111014731.000|20110111014734.000|TR0|
20110111014734.000|20110111014737.000|TR0|GERGEN:  That's -- that's a hard one.  And 
20110111014737.000|20110111014739.000|TR0|I do agree with you. It's been very 
20110111014739.000|20110111014742.000|TR0|episodic.  And, you know, I think all the 
20110111014742.000|20110111014744.000|TR0|way back to when President Reagan was shot 
20110111014744.000|20110111014747.000|TR0|and then Jim Brady went down and the Brady 
20110111014747.000|20110111014750.000|TR0|handgun movement and how much of a 
20110111014750.000|20110111014752.000|TR0|struggle that's been for them.  They've 
20110111014752.000|20110111014755.000|TR0|been at it now for a lot of these many 
20110111014755.000|20110111014758.000|TR0|years.
20110111014758.000|20110111014800.000|TR0|
20110111014800.000|20110111014803.000|TR0|I do think that this particular episode in 
20110111014803.000|20110111014805.000|TR0|Tucson has struck people emotionally in 
20110111014805.000|20110111014808.000|TR0|ways that I -- that are unusual and 
20110111014808.000|20110111014811.000|TR0|perhaps do open the door to the kind of 
20110111014811.000|20110111014813.000|TR0|serious conversations you're trying to 
20110111014813.000|20110111014816.000|TR0|invite here.  And I -- I think -- I think 
20110111014816.000|20110111014819.000|TR0|Gary Hart has a good point. The people who 
20110111014819.000|20110111014821.000|TR0|have ownership, whether it's radio or 
20110111014821.000|20110111014824.000|TR0|television or the movies, of things that 
20110111014824.000|20110111014826.000|TR0|in effect glorify violence or have used, 
20110111014826.000|20110111014829.000|TR0|employed the rhetoric of violence, I think 
20110111014829.000|20110111014832.000|TR0|those people do have responsibility.  It's 
20110111014832.000|20110111014834.000|TR0|not just people who are running for 
20110111014834.000|20110111014837.000|TR0|office. It's people who have corporate 
20110111014837.000|20110111014840.000|TR0|interests in this country as well.
20110111014840.000|20110111014842.000|TR0|
20110111014842.000|20110111014845.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right.  David Gergen, Senator 
20110111014845.000|20110111014847.000|TR0|Gary Hart, thank you both so much for 
20110111014847.000|20110111014850.000|TR0|being with us.
20110111014850.000|20110111014853.000|TR0|
20110111014853.000|20110111014855.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Thank you.
20110111014855.000|20110111014858.000|TR0|
20110111014858.000|20110111014901.000|TR0|HART:  Thank you.
20110111014901.000|20110111014903.000|TR0|
20110111014903.000|20110111014906.000|TR0|SPITZER:  When we come back, chief medical 
20110111014906.000|20110111014908.000|TR0|correspondent Sanjay Gupta will be here to 
20110111014908.000|20110111014911.000|TR0|tell us about the brain injury sustained 
20110111014911.000|20110111014914.000|TR0|by Representative Giffords.

20110111014919.000|20110111014922.000|TR0|
20110111014922.000|20110111014924.000|TR0|PARKER:  It sounds like a miracle.  
20110111014924.000|20110111014927.000|TR0|Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot 
20110111014927.000|20110111014929.000|TR0|through the head, yet doctors are 
20110111014929.000|20110111014932.000|TR0|cautiously optimistic about her survival.  
20110111014932.000|20110111014935.000|TR0|How is this possible?
20110111014935.000|20110111014937.000|TR0|
20110111014937.000|20110111014940.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Joining us now is CNN's chief 
20110111014940.000|20110111014943.000|TR0|medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.  
20110111014943.000|20110111014945.000|TR0|So, Sanjay, explain how this wonderful 
20110111014945.000|20110111014948.000|TR0|news that they're optimistic can be the 
20110111014948.000|20110111014950.000|TR0|case given the enormity of the trauma that 
20110111014950.000|20110111014953.000|TR0|she suffered.
20110111014953.000|20110111014956.000|TR0|
20110111014956.000|20110111014958.000|TR0|SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL 
20110111014958.000|20110111015001.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, a lot of 
20110111015001.000|20110111015004.000|TR0|things sort of working in her favor.  And 
20110111015004.000|20110111015006.000|TR0|to be fair, you know, most people who 
20110111015006.000|20110111015009.000|TR0|suffer this type of injury, a gunshot 
20110111015009.000|20110111015011.000|TR0|wound to the head, you know, a significant 
20110111015011.000|20110111015014.000|TR0|number of them don't even make it to the 
20110111015014.000|20110111015017.000|TR0|hospital on time.  The ones who do make it 
20110111015017.000|20110111015019.000|TR0|to the hospital, they face some 
20110111015019.000|20110111015022.000|TR0|significant challenges.  What she had 
20110111015022.000|20110111015025.000|TR0|going for her is she had excellent and 
20110111015025.000|20110111015027.000|TR0|quick care right on the scene, as you've 
20110111015027.000|20110111015030.000|TR0|talked about. People have heard also from 
20110111015030.000|20110111015032.000|TR0|the time she got to the hospital to the 
20110111015032.000|20110111015035.000|TR0|time she got to the operating room was 
20110111015035.000|20110111015038.000|TR0|just around 38 minutes.  So very fast.  
20110111015038.000|20110111015040.000|TR0|And speed is key when it comes to this 
20110111015040.000|20110111015043.000|TR0|sort of thing because the goal here and 
20110111015043.000|20110111015046.000|TR0|the thing that really improves survival 
20110111015046.000|20110111015048.000|TR0|and improves function in the long-term is 
20110111015048.000|20110111015051.000|TR0|to take the pressure off the brain as 
20110111015051.000|20110111015053.000|TR0|quickly as possible.
20110111015053.000|20110111015056.000|TR0|
20110111015056.000|20110111015059.000|TR0|So you have a bullet that has come into 
20110111015059.000|20110111015101.000|TR0|the brain.  In this case, it was what's 
20110111015101.000|20110111015104.000|TR0|called a through and through wound, 
20110111015104.000|20110111015107.000|TR0|meaning there was an entry site and an 
20110111015107.000|20110111015109.000|TR0|exit site.  And that's important because 
20110111015109.000|20110111015112.000|TR0|if you think about the energy of a bullet, 
20110111015112.000|20110111015114.000|TR0|where is that energy going to sort of most 
20110111015114.000|20110111015117.000|TR0|be felt?  It's felt mainly within the 
20110111015117.000|20110111015120.000|TR0|intercranial cavity. That's going to be 
20110111015120.000|20110111015122.000|TR0|worse than if the bullet leaves the skull 
20110111015122.000|20110111015125.000|TR0|and dissipates some of its energy out into 
20110111015125.000|20110111015127.000|TR0|space and the air.  So those are some of 
20110111015127.000|20110111015130.000|TR0|the things that she had working for her.
20110111015130.000|20110111015133.000|TR0|
20110111015133.000|20110111015135.000|TR0|She was able to follow commands when she 
20110111015135.000|20110111015138.000|TR0|-- even before she had her operation.  And 
20110111015138.000|20110111015141.000|TR0|I know people have talked about that.  But 
20110111015141.000|20110111015143.000|TR0|I have to tell you from a neuro 
20110111015143.000|20110111015146.000|TR0|standpoint, that's very significant.  It 
20110111015146.000|20110111015148.000|TR0|means she could hear what someone was 
20110111015148.000|20110111015151.000|TR0|telling her.  She had enough cognitive 
20110111015151.000|20110111015154.000|TR0|function to process that and to 
20110111015154.000|20110111015156.000|TR0|contextualize it and then to execute some 
20110111015156.000|20110111015159.000|TR0|sort of command based on that.  You know, 
20110111015159.000|20110111015202.000|TR0|hold up two fingers, do something like 
20110111015202.000|20110111015204.000|TR0|that.  So we hear that she's doing well 
20110111015204.000|20110111015207.000|TR0|today.  The pressure inside her brain, 
20110111015207.000|20110111015209.000|TR0|around her brain have remained low.  
20110111015209.000|20110111015212.000|TR0|They're getting CAT scans regularly.  And 
20110111015212.000|20110111015215.000|TR0|those are unchanged from day to day.
20110111015215.000|20110111015217.000|TR0|
20110111015217.000|20110111015220.000|TR0|PARKER:  Sanjay, I understand they cut a 
20110111015220.000|20110111015223.000|TR0|piece of her skull away so that the brain 
20110111015223.000|20110111015225.000|TR0|swelling -- the brain could swell and have 
20110111015225.000|20110111015228.000|TR0|room to swell.  How long is that a factor? 
20110111015228.000|20110111015230.000|TR0| And what will the doctors be looking for 
20110111015230.000|20110111015233.000|TR0|in the next few days?
20110111015233.000|20110111015236.000|TR0|
20110111015236.000|20110111015238.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Yes.  It was a really important 
20110111015238.000|20110111015241.000|TR0|part of the operation. You know, if you 
20110111015241.000|20110111015244.000|TR0|think about brain swelling, you know, in 
20110111015244.000|20110111015246.000|TR0|the brain and the skull, the brain really 
20110111015246.000|20110111015249.000|TR0|has nowhere to go except down in the 
20110111015249.000|20110111015251.000|TR0|spinal column where there's not enough 
20110111015251.000|20110111015254.000|TR0|room, and that can be a significant 
20110111015254.000|20110111015257.000|TR0|problem, medical and surgical problem.  So 
20110111015257.000|20110111015259.000|TR0|just removing some of that bone allowing 
20110111015259.000|20110111015302.000|TR0|the brain to swell into that area and then 
20110111015302.000|20110111015305.000|TR0|at some point in the future putting that 
20110111015305.000|20110111015307.000|TR0|bone back, that's sort of the key.
20110111015307.000|20110111015310.000|TR0|
20110111015310.000|20110111015312.000|TR0|You know, as far as swelling goes, you 
20110111015312.000|20110111015315.000|TR0|know, people say around three days after 
20110111015315.000|20110111015318.000|TR0|the injury is when it's sort of the worst. 
20110111015318.000|20110111015320.000|TR0| But within five days or so, the swelling 
20110111015320.000|20110111015323.000|TR0|starts to decrease pretty significantly.  
20110111015323.000|20110111015326.000|TR0|So we're sort of at the mark now where 
20110111015326.000|20110111015328.000|TR0|they're feeling comfortable that she 
20110111015328.000|20110111015331.000|TR0|hasn't had increased swelling.  That bone 
20110111015331.000|20110111015333.000|TR0|is gone, so even if she did, it should not 
20110111015333.000|20110111015336.000|TR0|be significant or catastrophic.  And then 
20110111015336.000|20110111015339.000|TR0|at some point they'll say, look, she's out 
20110111015339.000|20110111015341.000|TR0|of the -- out of concern about swelling 
20110111015341.000|20110111015344.000|TR0|specifically.  There are lots of things 
20110111015344.000|20110111015347.000|TR0|that neurosurgeons think about after an 
20110111015347.000|20110111015349.000|TR0|injury like this, but swelling being one 
20110111015349.000|20110111015352.000|TR0|of the most important.  And they think, 
20110111015352.000|20110111015354.000|TR0|you know, three to five days, that concern 
20110111015354.000|20110111015357.000|TR0|starts to go down.
20110111015357.000|20110111015400.000|TR0|
20110111015400.000|20110111015402.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, at what point would they 
20110111015402.000|20110111015405.000|TR0|put the skull piece back in place.
20110111015405.000|20110111015408.000|TR0|
20110111015408.000|20110111015410.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Right.
20110111015410.000|20110111015413.000|TR0|
20110111015413.000|20110111015415.000|TR0|PARKER:  And would there be additional 
20110111015415.000|20110111015418.000|TR0|surgeries necessary after that?
20110111015418.000|20110111015421.000|TR0|
20110111015421.000|20110111015423.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Yes, it's a good question.  And 
20110111015423.000|20110111015426.000|TR0|you know, if you think about it, Kathleen, 
20110111015426.000|20110111015429.000|TR0|the skull being gone at that point, 
20110111015429.000|20110111015431.000|TR0|obviously if you were to see her, she'd 
20110111015431.000|20110111015434.000|TR0|have a sort of depression in that part of 
20110111015434.000|20110111015436.000|TR0|her head as a result of that bone being 
20110111015436.000|20110111015439.000|TR0|gone.  The bone gets put back, you know, 
20110111015439.000|20110111015442.000|TR0|to sort of give her that natural sort of 
20110111015442.000|20110111015444.000|TR0|curvature to her head again.  And it's 
20110111015444.000|20110111015447.000|TR0|really done at a time when she is ready to 
20110111015447.000|20110111015450.000|TR0|have another surgery.  So even if the -- 
20110111015450.000|20110111015452.000|TR0|she is, you know, stable and always -- 
20110111015452.000|20110111015455.000|TR0|she's ready to tolerate another operation, 
20110111015455.000|20110111015457.000|TR0|it could be several weeks, even over a 
20110111015457.000|20110111015500.000|TR0|month before they decide to do that.  So 
20110111015500.000|20110111015503.000|TR0|that's going to be sometime down the road. 
20110111015503.000|20110111015505.000|TR0| As far as future operations, fingers 
20110111015505.000|20110111015508.000|TR0|crossed is what the surgeons say, that 
20110111015508.000|20110111015511.000|TR0|should be the only future operation that 
20110111015511.000|20110111015513.000|TR0|she really needs.  That's sort of what 
20110111015513.000|20110111015516.000|TR0|they're talking about really at this point.
20110111015516.000|20110111015518.000|TR0|
20110111015518.000|20110111015521.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And at what point in time -- 
20110111015521.000|20110111015524.000|TR0|what is the time frame in terms of 
20110111015524.000|20110111015526.000|TR0|measuring cognitive development, whether 
20110111015526.000|20110111015529.000|TR0|her memory has been lost, any of the other 
20110111015529.000|20110111015532.000|TR0|sort of critical cognitive issues that we 
20110111015532.000|20110111015534.000|TR0|would worry about?
20110111015534.000|20110111015537.000|TR0|
20110111015537.000|20110111015539.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You know, Eliot, she has a 
20110111015539.000|20110111015542.000|TR0|breathing tube in, as you know.  She's on 
20110111015542.000|20110111015545.000|TR0|a breathing machine.  So what -- you know, 
20110111015545.000|20110111015547.000|TR0|the neurological exam that they're getting 
20110111015547.000|20110111015550.000|TR0|at this point really is to have her follow 
20110111015550.000|20110111015553.000|TR0|these commands, which are pretty, you 
20110111015553.000|20110111015555.000|TR0|know, as I said simple commands.  Holding 
20110111015555.000|20110111015558.000|TR0|up two fingers.  The more sophisticated 
20110111015558.000|20110111015600.000|TR0|things in terms of cognitive function, 
20110111015600.000|20110111015603.000|TR0|which I think you're alluding to, she's 
20110111015603.000|20110111015606.000|TR0|going to need to be able to talk, probably 
20110111015606.000|20110111015608.000|TR0|communicate, you know, in some way a 
20110111015608.000|20110111015611.000|TR0|little bit more than she can now to test 
20110111015611.000|20110111015614.000|TR0|that. And that's going to be, you know, 
20110111015614.000|20110111015616.000|TR0|sometime down the line, at least a week 
20110111015616.000|20110111015619.000|TR0|probably away.  And even then, you know, 
20110111015619.000|20110111015621.000|TR0|when you really start to drill down and 
20110111015621.000|20110111015624.000|TR0|test really specific neurological 
20110111015624.000|20110111015627.000|TR0|functions, you know, that could be even a 
20110111015627.000|20110111015629.000|TR0|little longer than that.  She has to be 
20110111015629.000|20110111015632.000|TR0|able to communicate, though, and also 
20110111015632.000|20110111015635.000|TR0|testing the strength on the right side of 
20110111015635.000|20110111015637.000|TR0|her body.  That's going to be of concern 
20110111015637.000|20110111015640.000|TR0|given that this injury was on the left 
20110111015640.000|20110111015642.000|TR0|side of the brain.
20110111015642.000|20110111015645.000|TR0|
20110111015645.000|20110111015648.000|TR0|SPITZER:  All right, Sanjay.  Thank you so 
20110111015648.000|20110111015650.000|TR0|much for joining us. Of course, our 
20110111015650.000|20110111015653.000|TR0|thoughts and prayers are with her.
20110111015653.000|20110111015656.000|TR0|
20110111015656.000|20110111015658.000|TR0|PARKER:  Next, in a moment filled with 
20110111015658.000|20110111015701.000|TR0|chaos and tragedy, many heroes emerged, 
20110111015701.000|20110111015703.000|TR0|risking their own lives to save people 
20110111015703.000|20110111015706.000|TR0|they love or barely knew.  We'll tell you 
20110111015706.000|20110111015709.000|TR0|two of the remarkable stories when we come 
20110111015709.000|20110111015711.000|TR0|back.

20110111015717.000|20110111015719.000|TR0|
20110111015719.000|20110111015722.000|TR0|PARKER:  We've been telling you about the 
20110111015722.000|20110111015724.000|TR0|victims and heroes of Saturday's shooting 
20110111015724.000|20110111015727.000|TR0|rampage.  The final victim we want to 
20110111015727.000|20110111015730.000|TR0|remember tonight is 76-year-old Dorwin 
20110111015730.000|20110111015732.000|TR0|Stoddard known as Dory.  Stoddard and his 
20110111015732.000|20110111015735.000|TR0|wife Mavy were waiting in line to tell 
20110111015735.000|20110111015738.000|TR0|their congresswoman she was doing a good 
20110111015738.000|20110111015740.000|TR0|job when shots rang out.  Dory Stoddard 
20110111015740.000|20110111015743.000|TR0|pulled his wife to the ground and threw 
20110111015743.000|20110111015745.000|TR0|himself on top of her to shield her.  Mavy 
20110111015745.000|20110111015748.000|TR0|was shot three times and got hit in the 
20110111015748.000|20110111015751.000|TR0|leg but survived.  Dory Stoddard was shot 
20110111015751.000|20110111015753.000|TR0|in the head and died, saving his wife's 
20110111015753.000|20110111015756.000|TR0|life.  Dory and Mavy Stoddard were high 
20110111015756.000|20110111015759.000|TR0|school sweethearts who married other 
20110111015759.000|20110111015801.000|TR0|people and reconnected after their spouses 
20110111015801.000|20110111015804.000|TR0|died.
20110111015804.000|20110111015806.000|TR0|
20110111015806.000|20110111015809.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Stoddard is not the only person 
20110111015809.000|20110111015812.000|TR0|who acted bravely in the face of great 
20110111015812.000|20110111015814.000|TR0|danger.  One hero who lived to tell about 
20110111015814.000|20110111015817.000|TR0|it is 61- year-old Patricia Maisch.  
20110111015817.000|20110111015820.000|TR0|Maisch dropped to the ground when she 
20110111015820.000|20110111015822.000|TR0|first heard gunshots and soon found 
20110111015822.000|20110111015825.000|TR0|herself lying next to the gunman who was 
20110111015825.000|20110111015827.000|TR0|being wrestled to the ground.  Here's what 
20110111015827.000|20110111015830.000|TR0|happened next.

20110111015841.000|20110111015843.000|TR0|MAGAZINE:  Two gentlemen had -- had 
20110111015843.000|20110111015846.000|TR0|struggled with him and got him to the 
20110111015846.000|20110111015848.000|TR0|ground and then they started yelling, get 
20110111015848.000|20110111015851.000|TR0|the gun, get the magazine.  And I was able 
20110111015851.000|20110111015854.000|TR0|to -- he was laying right next to me.  So 
20110111015854.000|20110111015856.000|TR0|I was able to just kneel up and was able 
20110111015856.000|20110111015859.000|TR0|to take the magazine away from him.  He 
20110111015859.000|20110111015902.000|TR0|had pulled it out of his pocket and it was 
20110111015902.000|20110111015904.000|TR0|on the ground.  He dropped it and I was 
20110111015904.000|20110111015907.000|TR0|able to get it before he did.

20110111015915.000|20110111015917.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Maisch grabbed the ammunition 
20110111015917.000|20110111015920.000|TR0|before Jared Lee Loughner could reload his 
20110111015920.000|20110111015923.000|TR0|gun.  Maisch says she didn't have any 
20110111015923.000|20110111015925.000|TR0|opportunity to think.  She just reacted.

20110111015928.000|20110111015930.000|TR0|PARKER:  Remarkable actions in the face of 
20110111015930.000|20110111015933.000|TR0|unspeakable horror. Thank you so much for
