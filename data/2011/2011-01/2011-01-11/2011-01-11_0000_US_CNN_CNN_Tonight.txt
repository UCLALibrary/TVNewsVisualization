20110111000007.000|20110111000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST:  Thanks, Wolf, and good 
20110111000009.000|20110111000012.000|TR0|evening everyone from the University 
20110111000012.000|20110111000014.000|TR0|Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona.  
20110111000014.000|20110111000017.000|TR0|Tonight the alleged assassin in a weekend 
20110111000017.000|20110111000019.000|TR0|massacre here faces his first round of 
20110111000019.000|20110111000022.000|TR0|justice. Police released this photo of 
20110111000022.000|20110111000024.000|TR0|Jared Lee Loughner not long after his 
20110111000024.000|20110111000027.000|TR0|appearance in federal court in Phoenix.  
20110111000027.000|20110111000029.000|TR0|Loughner acknowledged he was aware of the 
20110111000029.000|20110111000032.000|TR0|five counts of murder and attempted murder 
20110111000032.000|20110111000034.000|TR0|could land him in prison for life.  And he 
20110111000034.000|20110111000037.000|TR0|was ordered held without bail.

20110111000039.000|20110111000042.000|TR0|Here at the Medical Center, the assassin's 
20110111000042.000|20110111000044.000|TR0|prime target, Congresswoman Gabrielle 
20110111000044.000|20110111000047.000|TR0|Giffords, remains in critical condition.  
20110111000047.000|20110111000050.000|TR0|Her doctors reporting so far they see no 
20110111000050.000|20110111000052.000|TR0|additional brain swelling.

20110111000102.000|20110111000105.000|TR0|and we don't see an increase, we're 
20110111000105.000|20110111000107.000|TR0|slightly more optimistic.

20110111000115.000|20110111000117.000|TR0|KING:  In Washington, President Obama this 
20110111000117.000|20110111000120.000|TR0|morning led a moment of silence to honor 
20110111000120.000|20110111000122.000|TR0|the six killed and 14 wounded in the 
20110111000122.000|20110111000125.000|TR0|Saturday shooting spree.  We visited the 
20110111000125.000|20110111000128.000|TR0|crime scene a bit earlier today.  It was 
20110111000128.000|20110111000130.000|TR0|still off-limits and investigators were 
20110111000130.000|20110111000133.000|TR0|still gathering evidence there.  This 
20110111000133.000|20110111000135.000|TR0|community is in mourning, and also in the 
20110111000135.000|20110111000138.000|TR0|middle of a perhaps inevitable raw 
20110111000138.000|20110111000140.000|TR0|political debate, over whether heated 
20110111000140.000|20110111000143.000|TR0|political rhetoric here and nationally 
20110111000143.000|20110111000145.000|TR0|somehow shares blame.  Today I sat down 
20110111000145.000|20110111000148.000|TR0|with three political rivals, the leaders 
20110111000148.000|20110111000150.000|TR0|of the local Democratic, Republican, and 
20110111000150.000|20110111000153.000|TR0|Tea Party organizations.

20110111000203.000|20110111000206.000|TR0|us together.  I think we need to take -- 
20110111000206.000|20110111000208.000|TR0|we need to take a breather from politics 
20110111000208.000|20110111000211.000|TR0|at the moment.  We have fellow people 
20110111000211.000|20110111000213.000|TR0|Tucsonans for their lives, for their 
20110111000213.000|20110111000216.000|TR0|survival.  If you take the professions of 
20110111000216.000|20110111000218.000|TR0|the victims out, you have a massacre in 
20110111000218.000|20110111000221.000|TR0|our backyard.

20110111000228.000|20110111000231.000|TR0|KING:  More of that conversation ahead, 
20110111000231.000|20110111000233.000|TR0|and a closer look at the congresswoman the 
20110111000233.000|20110111000236.000|TR0|gunman allegedly targeted because he 
20110111000236.000|20110111000238.000|TR0|didn't like her answer at a town hall 
20110111000238.000|20110111000241.000|TR0|three years ago.  But we begin with the 
20110111000241.000|20110111000244.000|TR0|alleged shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, and 
20110111000244.000|20110111000246.000|TR0|his day in court.  CNN's Ted Rowlands was 
20110111000246.000|20110111000249.000|TR0|there -- Ted.     TED ROWLANDS, CNN 
20110111000249.000|20110111000251.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  John, Loughner was 
20110111000251.000|20110111000254.000|TR0|absolutely coherent in this relatively 
20110111000254.000|20110111000256.000|TR0|short hearing, it lasted about 15 minutes. 
20110111000256.000|20110111000259.000|TR0|He was brought in from a side door wearing 
20110111000259.000|20110111000301.000|TR0|a tan prison uniform, jail uniform.  He 
20110111000301.000|20110111000304.000|TR0|sat with his lawyer and then was brought 
20110111000304.000|20110111000306.000|TR0|up to a podium when the judge took the 
20110111000306.000|20110111000309.000|TR0|bench.  And immediately when the judge 
20110111000309.000|20110111000311.000|TR0|took the bench, he asked him, are you 
20110111000311.000|20110111000314.000|TR0|Jared Lee Loughner and Loughner responded 
20110111000314.000|20110111000316.000|TR0|in a very strong voice, leaned into the 
20110111000316.000|20110111000319.000|TR0|microphone, yes, I am Jared Lee Loughner.
20110111000319.000|20110111000322.000|TR0|
20110111000322.000|20110111000324.000|TR0|That kicked off what turned out to be a 
20110111000324.000|20110111000327.000|TR0|question and answer session to some extent 
20110111000327.000|20110111000329.000|TR0|as they went through the business of this 
20110111000329.000|20110111000332.000|TR0|proceeding where Loughner participated 
20110111000332.000|20110111000334.000|TR0|with "yes" answers typically, but when 
20110111000334.000|20110111000337.000|TR0|asked a question, he answered the judge.  
20110111000337.000|20110111000339.000|TR0|We weren't sure what to expect.  We had 
20110111000339.000|20110111000342.000|TR0|heard rumors or we had heard stories that 
20110111000342.000|20110111000344.000|TR0|he had disrupted classrooms and we knew 
20110111000344.000|20110111000347.000|TR0|that he wasn't talking to law enforcement, 
20110111000347.000|20110111000349.000|TR0|so it was clear there was a possibility he 
20110111000349.000|20110111000352.000|TR0|would say nothing.
20110111000352.000|20110111000354.000|TR0|
20110111000354.000|20110111000357.000|TR0|In fact, the judge at the beginning of the 
20110111000357.000|20110111000359.000|TR0|hearing said, I'm going to ask you 
20110111000359.000|20110111000402.000|TR0|questions, you don't have to answer any of 
20110111000402.000|20110111000405.000|TR0|them, but he did answer all of them and 
20110111000405.000|20110111000407.000|TR0|conducted himself very well in that he was 
20110111000407.000|20110111000410.000|TR0|very rigid and just was focused on the 
20110111000410.000|20110111000412.000|TR0|proceedings at hand.  The judge did read 
20110111000412.000|20110111000415.000|TR0|all of the counts against him.  At one 
20110111000415.000|20110111000417.000|TR0|point, when the judge in this case, 
20110111000417.000|20110111000420.000|TR0|Lawrence Anderson (ph), read the murder 
20110111000420.000|20110111000422.000|TR0|charge that was subjected to the shooting 
20110111000422.000|20110111000425.000|TR0|of the federal judge in Tucson, John Roll, 
20110111000425.000|20110111000427.000|TR0|it seemed like this judge paused a little 
20110111000427.000|20110111000430.000|TR0|bit, because he was obviously reading the 
20110111000430.000|20110111000432.000|TR0|charge of murder and he was dealing with 
20110111000432.000|20110111000435.000|TR0|one of his colleagues, another federal 
20110111000435.000|20110111000437.000|TR0|judge on the bench in Tucson, other than 
20110111000437.000|20110111000440.000|TR0|that the judge and the defendant very 
20110111000440.000|20110111000443.000|TR0|clear, very succinct and a quick hearing.  
20110111000443.000|20110111000445.000|TR0|He'll be back in court the 24th of this 
20110111000445.000|20110111000448.000|TR0|month.  That will be when the preliminary 
20110111000448.000|20110111000450.000|TR0|hearing is set.
20110111000450.000|20110111000453.000|TR0|
20110111000453.000|20110111000455.000|TR0|KING:  And, I want you to get into a 
20110111000455.000|20110111000458.000|TR0|little bit more detail because the 
20110111000458.000|20110111000500.000|TR0|descriptions we hear, you mentioned the 
20110111000500.000|20110111000503.000|TR0|classroom, we've seen the YouTube postings 
20110111000503.000|20110111000505.000|TR0|of somebody who can sort of ramble, have 
20110111000505.000|20110111000508.000|TR0|incoherent thoughts, jump from one idea to 
20110111000508.000|20110111000510.000|TR0|another, but in court today, a coherent 
20110111000510.000|20110111000513.000|TR0|presentation, yes, is that right?
20110111000513.000|20110111000515.000|TR0|
20110111000515.000|20110111000518.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  Yes, absolutely.  The judge at 
20110111000518.000|20110111000521.000|TR0|one point held up a document that the 
20110111000521.000|20110111000523.000|TR0|defendant had helped fill out, which was 
20110111000523.000|20110111000526.000|TR0|having to do with whether or not he would 
20110111000526.000|20110111000528.000|TR0|be eligible to have the taxpayers pay for 
20110111000528.000|20110111000531.000|TR0|his legal defense, and the judge said, did 
20110111000531.000|20110111000533.000|TR0|you sign this, because I can't read this 
20110111000533.000|20110111000536.000|TR0|very well.  I know it's difficult to sign 
20110111000536.000|20110111000538.000|TR0|something in handcuffs, but did you sign 
20110111000538.000|20110111000541.000|TR0|this?
20110111000541.000|20110111000543.000|TR0|
20110111000543.000|20110111000546.000|TR0|And he said, yes.  And he asked did your 
20110111000546.000|20110111000548.000|TR0|lawyer help you fill out this form?  And 
20110111000548.000|20110111000551.000|TR0|he said, yes, my lawyer helped me fill out 
20110111000551.000|20110111000553.000|TR0|this form. Everything the judge asked, he 
20110111000553.000|20110111000556.000|TR0|understood and immediately answered in a 
20110111000556.000|20110111000559.000|TR0|very succinct manner with a very strong 
20110111000559.000|20110111000601.000|TR0|voice.  Typically there are a lot of times 
20110111000601.000|20110111000604.000|TR0|in these situations the defendant will 
20110111000604.000|20110111000606.000|TR0|come up with a very weak voice, be very 
20110111000606.000|20110111000609.000|TR0|nervous.  He was very strong, very rigid, 
20110111000609.000|20110111000611.000|TR0|and very determined, it seemed, and very 
20110111000611.000|20110111000614.000|TR0|focused as well, something we weren't 
20110111000614.000|20110111000616.000|TR0|necessarily expecting.
20110111000616.000|20110111000619.000|TR0|
20110111000619.000|20110111000621.000|TR0|KING:  And Ted, this is the very first 
20110111000621.000|20110111000624.000|TR0|hearing you mentioned, it will be a few 
20110111000624.000|20110111000626.000|TR0|more weeks we see him back in court.  I 
20110111000626.000|20110111000629.000|TR0|assume nothing at all, no indications at 
20110111000629.000|20110111000631.000|TR0|all of the strategy we will get from the 
20110111000631.000|20110111000634.000|TR0|defense team?
20110111000634.000|20110111000637.000|TR0|
20110111000637.000|20110111000639.000|TR0|ROWLANDS:  No, not at all.  They are just 
20110111000639.000|20110111000642.000|TR0|assembling.  Judy Clarke was appointed 
20110111000642.000|20110111000644.000|TR0|officially by the judge, pending some 
20110111000644.000|20110111000647.000|TR0|paperwork that she has to get, basically, 
20110111000647.000|20110111000649.000|TR0|OK'd to practice in Arizona, because she's 
20110111000649.000|20110111000652.000|TR0|licensed in California.  But this is a 
20110111000652.000|20110111000654.000|TR0|prosecutor with a lot of experience.  She 
20110111000654.000|20110111000657.000|TR0|is not going to go in any direction early 
20110111000657.000|20110111000659.000|TR0|on in this case.  She'll see what she has; 
20110111000659.000|20110111000702.000|TR0|she'll see what she's up against and plot 
20110111000702.000|20110111000704.000|TR0|it from there.  She represented Ted 
20110111000704.000|20110111000707.000|TR0|Kaczynski, Eric Rudolph and others.  So 
20110111000707.000|20110111000709.000|TR0|this is a very seasoned public defender, 
20110111000709.000|20110111000712.000|TR0|and you're not going to get any indication 
20110111000712.000|20110111000715.000|TR0|on where they're going this early on.
20110111000715.000|20110111000717.000|TR0|
20110111000717.000|20110111000720.000|TR0|KING:  Ted Rowlands for us on the 
20110111000720.000|20110111000722.000|TR0|suspect's first day in court. What else 
20110111000722.000|20110111000725.000|TR0|are we learning about this alleged 
20110111000725.000|20110111000727.000|TR0|assassin?  Well, Drew Griffin has been 
20110111000727.000|20110111000730.000|TR0|spending considerable time reporting on 
20110111000730.000|20110111000732.000|TR0|that.  He joins me here.  And Drew, the 
20110111000732.000|20110111000735.000|TR0|pattern that people seem to be suggesting 
20110111000735.000|20110111000737.000|TR0|is someone who had a long period of 
20110111000737.000|20110111000740.000|TR0|growing erratic and more erratic behavior.
20110111000740.000|20110111000742.000|TR0|
20110111000742.000|20110111000745.000|TR0|DREW GRIFFIN, CNN INVESTIGATIVE 
20110111000745.000|20110111000747.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  John, I think we can now 
20110111000747.000|20110111000750.000|TR0|trace this back to his junior year in high 
20110111000750.000|20110111000752.000|TR0|school when we began to see this mental 
20110111000752.000|20110111000755.000|TR0|deterioration in what happened with Jared 
20110111000755.000|20110111000758.000|TR0|Loughner.  Friends say he was bright, a 
20110111000758.000|20110111000800.000|TR0|saxophone player in the band, then, all of 
20110111000800.000|20110111000803.000|TR0|a sudden, a change.  Drug use, he doesn't 
20110111000803.000|20110111000805.000|TR0|come back his senior year.
20110111000805.000|20110111000808.000|TR0|
20110111000808.000|20110111000810.000|TR0|And then it really accelerated in his -- 
20110111000810.000|20110111000813.000|TR0|well just last summer. He goes to a Pima 
20110111000813.000|20110111000815.000|TR0|County (ph) community college elementary 
20110111000815.000|20110111000818.000|TR0|algebra class.  Five times during a very 
20110111000818.000|20110111000820.000|TR0|short period of time the campus police are 
20110111000820.000|20110111000823.000|TR0|called in because he's either noisy in 
20110111000823.000|20110111000825.000|TR0|class, disrupting class, challenging the 
20110111000825.000|20110111000828.000|TR0|teachers.  He became, according to the 
20110111000828.000|20110111000830.000|TR0|teacher and the students, a very 
20110111000830.000|20110111000833.000|TR0|threatening person and so the school did 
20110111000833.000|20110111000836.000|TR0|act. The school dove in and interdicted 
20110111000836.000|20110111000838.000|TR0|with him.
20110111000838.000|20110111000841.000|TR0|
20110111000841.000|20110111000843.000|TR0|KING:  And dove in and interdicted and the 
20110111000843.000|20110111000846.000|TR0|questions people ask, you've seen 
20110111000846.000|20110111000848.000|TR0|comparisons to Virginia Tech, where you 
20110111000848.000|20110111000851.000|TR0|had a student who obviously showed some 
20110111000851.000|20110111000853.000|TR0|mental health issues, some unstable 
20110111000853.000|20110111000856.000|TR0|behavior. And people in this community are 
20110111000856.000|20110111000858.000|TR0|asking, people around the country are 
20110111000858.000|20110111000901.000|TR0|asking, was the behavior so difficult, so 
20110111000901.000|20110111000903.000|TR0|problematic, so troubling that should 
20110111000903.000|20110111000906.000|TR0|someone have gone to authorities?  Should 
20110111000906.000|20110111000908.000|TR0|somebody have tried to get him mental 
20110111000908.000|20110111000911.000|TR0|health care?
20110111000911.000|20110111000914.000|TR0|
20110111000914.000|20110111000916.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  Well, to help people, right, let 
20110111000916.000|20110111000919.000|TR0|me tell you what exactly what did happen.  
20110111000919.000|20110111000921.000|TR0|The school held a behavioral assessment 
20110111000921.000|20110111000924.000|TR0|committee on this guy.  So that was 
20110111000924.000|20110111000926.000|TR0|administrators, a police chief, other 
20110111000926.000|20110111000929.000|TR0|administrators got together, along with an 
20110111000929.000|20110111000931.000|TR0|outside psychologist or psychiatrist, and 
20110111000931.000|20110111000934.000|TR0|evaluated his condition, and the 
20110111000934.000|20110111000936.000|TR0|disruptions. And they determined the 
20110111000936.000|20110111000939.000|TR0|proper procedure was to tell him and his 
20110111000939.000|20110111000941.000|TR0|parents, listen, you're not invited back 
20110111000941.000|20110111000944.000|TR0|to this school until you get a mental 
20110111000944.000|20110111000946.000|TR0|evaluation.  That was the school code 
20110111000946.000|20110111000949.000|TR0|policy that they say they followed, 
20110111000949.000|20110111000952.000|TR0|followed to protect the other students.  
20110111000952.000|20110111000954.000|TR0|Not to necessarily heal or help this kid, 
20110111000954.000|20110111000957.000|TR0|but to protect other students in that 
20110111000957.000|20110111000959.000|TR0|class.  So he was kept from coming back to 
20110111000959.000|20110111001002.000|TR0|the campus and they felt that is what was 
20110111001002.000|20110111001004.000|TR0|their legal burden to do.
20110111001004.000|20110111001007.000|TR0|
20110111001007.000|20110111001009.000|TR0|KING:  And the teachers and the students 
20110111001009.000|20110111001012.000|TR0|in that classroom, did they feel they had 
20110111001012.000|20110111001014.000|TR0|a hothead, they had someone who was 
20110111001014.000|20110111001017.000|TR0|unpredictable, or did they feel they were 
20110111001017.000|20110111001019.000|TR0|in the presence of somebody who could take 
20110111001019.000|20110111001022.000|TR0|the steps that he allegedly took the other 
20110111001022.000|20110111001024.000|TR0|day?
20110111001024.000|20110111001027.000|TR0|
20110111001027.000|20110111001030.000|TR0|GRIFFIN:  John, we read some of the 
20110111001030.000|20110111001032.000|TR0|e-mails in real time during the class, 
20110111001032.000|20110111001035.000|TR0|other students were saying, this guy 
20110111001035.000|20110111001037.000|TR0|scares the crap out of me.  The teacher 
20110111001037.000|20110111001040.000|TR0|himself, who I interviewed, Ben Begahe 
20110111001040.000|20110111001042.000|TR0|(ph) specifically said, look, we all felt 
20110111001042.000|20110111001045.000|TR0|this guy could come back with a gun.  Even 
20110111001045.000|20110111001047.000|TR0|though he wasn't overtly saying that, even 
20110111001047.000|20110111001050.000|TR0|though he wasn't overtly saying he was 
20110111001050.000|20110111001052.000|TR0|going to come back and kill anybody, he 
20110111001052.000|20110111001055.000|TR0|never said those words, but he was creepy 
20110111001055.000|20110111001057.000|TR0|in a way.  And they really felt that this 
20110111001057.000|20110111001100.000|TR0|guy was a guy who could do exactly what 
20110111001100.000|20110111001102.000|TR0|he's now accused of doing.  In fact, Ben 
20110111001102.000|20110111001105.000|TR0|Begahe (ph), the teacher said, look, I was 
20110111001105.000|20110111001108.000|TR0|shocked when I saw his name, but not 
20110111001108.000|20110111001110.000|TR0|surprised.
20110111001110.000|20110111001113.000|TR0|
20110111001113.000|20110111001115.000|TR0|KING:  Not surprised, horrible.  Drew, 
20110111001115.000|20110111001118.000|TR0|great reporting, thanks so much -- Drew

20110111001123.000|20110111001125.000|TR0|When we come back, a bit ahead, we'll take 
20110111001125.000|20110111001128.000|TR0|a much closer look at the congresswoman 
20110111001128.000|20110111001130.000|TR0|who in this hospital behind us is clinging 
20110111001130.000|20110111001133.000|TR0|for life tonight.

20110111001135.000|20110111001138.000|TR0|Just ahead though, a discussion in this 
20110111001138.000|20110111001140.000|TR0|state and around the country about guns, 
20110111001140.000|20110111001143.000|TR0|about the culture of guns, and about the 
20110111001143.000|20110111001145.000|TR0|often volatile politics right here in 
20110111001145.000|20110111001148.000|TR0|Arizona.  Stay with us.

20110111001156.000|20110111001158.000|TR0|KING:  Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was 
20110111001158.000|20110111001201.000|TR0|supposed to deliver her State of the State 
20110111001201.000|20110111001203.000|TR0|address today, but she told lawmakers in 
20110111001203.000|20110111001206.000|TR0|Phoenix that could wait.  Why?  One of the 
20110111001206.000|20110111001208.000|TR0|reasons, you see these pictures behind me, 
20110111001208.000|20110111001211.000|TR0|this is the makeshift vigil outside the 
20110111001211.000|20110111001213.000|TR0|hospital here, the makeshift vigil where 
20110111001213.000|20110111001216.000|TR0|people have been gathering and they're 
20110111001216.000|20110111001218.000|TR0|lighting candles, just stopping by.
20110111001218.000|20110111001221.000|TR0|
20110111001221.000|20110111001223.000|TR0|The congresswoman is inside; other victims 
20110111001223.000|20110111001226.000|TR0|of the shooting are inside.  It's a 
20110111001226.000|20110111001229.000|TR0|remarkable scene outside.  One of the 
20110111001229.000|20110111001231.000|TR0|reasons, one of the reasons the governor 
20110111001231.000|20110111001234.000|TR0|said in this state right now politics is 
20110111001234.000|20110111001236.000|TR0|on hold, but she also sounded a bit of a 
20110111001236.000|20110111001239.000|TR0|defiant tone.

20110111001246.000|20110111001249.000|TR0|GOV. JAN BREWER (R), ARIZONA:  Saturday's 
20110111001249.000|20110111001251.000|TR0|events were not just an attack on those 
20110111001251.000|20110111001254.000|TR0|individuals we loved and lost, but an 
20110111001254.000|20110111001256.000|TR0|assault on our constitutional republic, on 
20110111001256.000|20110111001259.000|TR0|our democracy, on all we treasure and all 
20110111001259.000|20110111001301.000|TR0|hold dear as citizens and public servants. 
20110111001301.000|20110111001304.000|TR0| Arizona is in pain.  Yes. Our grief is 
20110111001304.000|20110111001307.000|TR0|profound.  We are yet in the first hours 
20110111001307.000|20110111001309.000|TR0|of our sorrow, but we have not been 
20110111001309.000|20110111001312.000|TR0|brought down.  We will never be brought 
20110111001312.000|20110111001314.000|TR0|down.

20110111001322.000|20110111001324.000|TR0|KING:  Governor Brewer earlier today 
20110111001324.000|20110111001327.000|TR0|joining me for a conversation about the 
20110111001327.000|20110111001329.000|TR0|raw moment in this state.  Ed Montini, 
20110111001329.000|20110111001332.000|TR0|he's a columnist at "The Arizona 
20110111001332.000|20110111001334.000|TR0|Republic," he's in Phoenix, and Jessica 
20110111001334.000|20110111001337.000|TR0|Yellin, our national political 
20110111001337.000|20110111001339.000|TR0|correspondent is here with me.  E.J. 
20110111001339.000|20110111001342.000|TR0|Montini, I want to start with you first.  
20110111001342.000|20110111001345.000|TR0|You've covered this state for so long, on 
20110111001345.000|20110111001347.000|TR0|the one hand, we have a very raw political 
20110111001347.000|20110111001350.000|TR0|debate unfolding, and on the other hand, 
20110111001350.000|20110111001352.000|TR0|you have the governor saying, let's 
20110111001352.000|20110111001355.000|TR0|everybody take a deep breath.       You 
20110111001355.000|20110111001357.000|TR0|see the national commentary, people say 
20110111001357.000|20110111001400.000|TR0|well, it's because of the immigration and 
20110111001400.000|20110111001402.000|TR0|the other raw debates in this state, 
20110111001402.000|20110111001405.000|TR0|they've created this climate.  And others 
20110111001405.000|20110111001407.000|TR0|say you know that's hogwash.  That this is 
20110111001407.000|20110111001410.000|TR0|somebody who's demented or has mental 
20110111001410.000|20110111001412.000|TR0|health issues, who acted for whatever 
20110111001412.000|20110111001415.000|TR0|reason, but don't connect those dots.  
20110111001415.000|20110111001417.000|TR0|Tell us about your state.

20110111001420.000|20110111001423.000|TR0|E.J. MONTINI, COLUMNIST, ARIZONA REPUBLIC: 
20110111001423.000|20110111001425.000|TR0| Well I think that actually there's an 
20110111001425.000|20110111001428.000|TR0|element of truth to both of those 
20110111001428.000|20110111001430.000|TR0|statements.  I mean the fact of the matter 
20110111001430.000|20110111001433.000|TR0|is when people say that it could have 
20110111001433.000|20110111001435.000|TR0|happened anywhere, that's probably true.  
20110111001435.000|20110111001438.000|TR0|But then again, it did not happen 
20110111001438.000|20110111001440.000|TR0|anywhere, it happened here.  And I think 
20110111001440.000|20110111001443.000|TR0|since it did happen here that those of us 
20110111001443.000|20110111001445.000|TR0|who live here and have lived here for a 
20110111001445.000|20110111001448.000|TR0|long time have a responsibility to face 
20110111001448.000|20110111001450.000|TR0|what really has been, as you know, since 
20110111001450.000|20110111001453.000|TR0|you were here recently yourself, a very 
20110111001453.000|20110111001455.000|TR0|toxic political environment, where people 
20110111001455.000|20110111001458.000|TR0|were saying things about one another that 
20110111001458.000|20110111001500.000|TR0|really went beyond the pale, and they have 
20110111001500.000|20110111001503.000|TR0|been for quite some time, both in the 
20110111001503.000|20110111001506.000|TR0|recent immigration debate and then in the 
20110111001506.000|20110111001508.000|TR0|recent political campaign.
20110111001508.000|20110111001511.000|TR0|
20110111001511.000|20110111001513.000|TR0|KING:  Well let me follow-up on that point 
20110111001513.000|20110111001516.000|TR0|because you wrote this blog posting today, 
20110111001516.000|20110111001518.000|TR0|now comes Representative Jack Harper (ph), 
20110111001518.000|20110111001521.000|TR0|who not only inserts his foot in his 
20110111001521.000|20110111001523.000|TR0|mouth, but tries to swallow his entire 
20110111001523.000|20110111001526.000|TR0|leg, telling "USA Today" if Sheriff Dupnik 
20110111001526.000|20110111001528.000|TR0|(ph) would have done his job, maybe the 
20110111001528.000|20110111001531.000|TR0|shooting doesn't happen.  At a time when 
20110111001531.000|20110111001533.000|TR0|everyone needs to tone down the rhetoric 
20110111001533.000|20110111001536.000|TR0|this is what we get?
20110111001536.000|20110111001538.000|TR0|
20110111001538.000|20110111001541.000|TR0|MONTINI:  It's exactly correct.  Yes, he 
20110111001541.000|20110111001544.000|TR0|said something along the lines (INAUDIBLE) 
20110111001544.000|20110111001546.000|TR0|if everyone were carrying guns, there 
20110111001546.000|20110111001549.000|TR0|would be fewer victims.  When you know 
20110111001549.000|20110111001551.000|TR0|it's difficult enough to get through a 
20110111001551.000|20110111001554.000|TR0|tragic situation like this, trying to have 
20110111001554.000|20110111001556.000|TR0|at least a rational conversation about 
20110111001556.000|20110111001559.000|TR0|toning down the rhetoric when you have 
20110111001559.000|20110111001601.000|TR0|elected officials who are going out of 
20110111001601.000|20110111001604.000|TR0|their way to say inflammatory things like 
20110111001604.000|20110111001606.000|TR0|that.  It's just ridiculous and stupid and 
20110111001606.000|20110111001609.000|TR0|actually brings down -- it does just the 
20110111001609.000|20110111001611.000|TR0|opposite.  It ratchets up the rhetoric.
20110111001611.000|20110111001614.000|TR0|
20110111001614.000|20110111001616.000|TR0|KING:  And Jessica, one of the 
20110111001616.000|20110111001619.000|TR0|conversations inevitably, whether it's 
20110111001619.000|20110111001622.000|TR0|after Virginia Tech, whether it is after 
20110111001622.000|20110111001624.000|TR0|this incident, people start asking 
20110111001624.000|20110111001627.000|TR0|questions about not only the politics of 
20110111001627.000|20110111001629.000|TR0|guns but the laws of guns and questioning 
20110111001629.000|20110111001632.000|TR0|-- it is a -- some people here would say, 
20110111001632.000|20110111001634.000|TR0|you don't understand us if you come from 
20110111001634.000|20110111001637.000|TR0|an urban area, if you come from somewhere 
20110111001637.000|20110111001639.000|TR0|else, and guns are an important part of 
20110111001639.000|20110111001642.000|TR0|the culture here, but even today, when I 
20110111001642.000|20110111001644.000|TR0|was having lunch with a Democratic, 
20110111001644.000|20110111001647.000|TR0|Republican, and Tea Party leader, several 
20110111001647.000|20110111001649.000|TR0|people in the restaurant complained to me 
20110111001649.000|20110111001652.000|TR0|about easy access to guns here, so it is a 
20110111001652.000|20110111001654.000|TR0|political debate reopened.
20110111001654.000|20110111001657.000|TR0|
20110111001657.000|20110111001700.000|TR0|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN NATIONAL 
20110111001700.000|20110111001702.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  You know Gabrielle 
20110111001702.000|20110111001705.000|TR0|Giffords herself is a Second Amendment 
20110111001705.000|20110111001707.000|TR0|defender talked about carrying a gun 
20110111001707.000|20110111001710.000|TR0|herself, or owning a gun.  And I've talked 
20110111001710.000|20110111001712.000|TR0|to several people, Democrats and 
20110111001712.000|20110111001715.000|TR0|Republicans here, who think that any 
20110111001715.000|20110111001717.000|TR0|changes to the gun laws wouldn't fly after 
20110111001717.000|20110111001720.000|TR0|this.  But I will tell you that he was 
20110111001720.000|20110111001722.000|TR0|able to buy this extended clip of 
20110111001722.000|20110111001725.000|TR0|ammunition that allowed him to get off 31 
20110111001725.000|20110111001727.000|TR0|rounds because the assault weapons ban had 
20110111001727.000|20110111001730.000|TR0|expired and until that expired, those were 
20110111001730.000|20110111001732.000|TR0|banned.       So that's something we're 
20110111001732.000|20110111001735.000|TR0|hearing folks in Washington talk about 
20110111001735.000|20110111001738.000|TR0|reintroducing, as you know, a measure to 
20110111001738.000|20110111001740.000|TR0|ban that kind of clip.  Is this the kind 
20110111001740.000|20110111001743.000|TR0|of debate that could open up after this?  
20110111001743.000|20110111001745.000|TR0|Yes.  But activists who pushed on these 
20110111001745.000|20110111001748.000|TR0|issues says it has to happen very quickly 
20110111001748.000|20110111001750.000|TR0|afterwards, otherwise whatever political 
20110111001750.000|20110111001753.000|TR0|will is there goes away.
20110111001753.000|20110111001755.000|TR0|
20110111001755.000|20110111001758.000|TR0|KING:  But, Ed Montini, this was a very 
20110111001758.000|20110111001800.000|TR0|emotional volatile tough campaign here.  
20110111001800.000|20110111001803.000|TR0|Gabby Giffords survived just barely in her 
20110111001803.000|20110111001805.000|TR0|congressional race, a very tough district. 
20110111001805.000|20110111001808.000|TR0| She won.  Has the tone, has the tenor, 
20110111001808.000|20110111001810.000|TR0|has there been more outreach in 
20110111001810.000|20110111001813.000|TR0|conciliation after the debate or are those 
20110111001813.000|20110111001816.000|TR0|very debates, immigration, what some would 
20110111001816.000|20110111001818.000|TR0|call health care rationing, budget cuts 
20110111001818.000|20110111001821.000|TR0|and other things --
20110111001821.000|20110111001823.000|TR0|
20110111001823.000|20110111001826.000|TR0|MONTINI:  Right.
20110111001826.000|20110111001828.000|TR0|
20110111001828.000|20110111001831.000|TR0|KING:   -- are those things all going full 
20110111001831.000|20110111001833.000|TR0|force?
20110111001833.000|20110111001836.000|TR0|
20110111001836.000|20110111001838.000|TR0|MONTINI:  Well they're still -- I think 
20110111001838.000|20110111001841.000|TR0|they're still going full force here.  I 
20110111001841.000|20110111001843.000|TR0|mean the fact of the matter is we're also 
20110111001843.000|20110111001846.000|TR0|going to be all too soon in another really 
20110111001846.000|20110111001848.000|TR0|divisive immigration discussion coming up 
20110111001848.000|20110111001851.000|TR0|when Arizona and other states introduce 
20110111001851.000|20110111001853.000|TR0|laws to -- that essentially would alter 
20110111001853.000|20110111001856.000|TR0|the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.  
20110111001856.000|20110111001859.000|TR0|That's going to be a very divisive debate. 
20110111001859.000|20110111001901.000|TR0| It's not going to help anybody.
20110111001901.000|20110111001904.000|TR0|
20110111001904.000|20110111001906.000|TR0|It's not going to aid very much to a 
20110111001906.000|20110111001909.000|TR0|conciliatory tone throughout the entire 
20110111001909.000|20110111001911.000|TR0|country.  So that's going to keep that 
20110111001911.000|20110111001914.000|TR0|issue out there in front.  And as far as 
20110111001914.000|20110111001916.000|TR0|the guns go, though, in Arizona, I think 
20110111001916.000|20110111001919.000|TR0|Representative Giffords, it's true, she 
20110111001919.000|20110111001921.000|TR0|was a very strong Second Amendment 
20110111001921.000|20110111001924.000|TR0|supporter, and I really think you do have 
20110111001924.000|20110111001926.000|TR0|that mentality here in Arizona.
20110111001926.000|20110111001929.000|TR0|
20110111001929.000|20110111001931.000|TR0|And I think that to a degree, I'm not sure 
20110111001931.000|20110111001934.000|TR0|I buy into the argument that Arizona is 
20110111001934.000|20110111001937.000|TR0|all that much worse for its, what would be 
20110111001937.000|20110111001939.000|TR0|considered, very liberal gun laws, easy 
20110111001939.000|20110111001942.000|TR0|access to weapons.  There are some things 
20110111001942.000|20110111001944.000|TR0|in this state that really should be 
20110111001944.000|20110111001947.000|TR0|changed, like a loophole that allows 
20110111001947.000|20110111001949.000|TR0|people to buy weapons in gun shows without 
20110111001949.000|20110111001952.000|TR0|any kind of checks whatsoever.  But for 
20110111001952.000|20110111001954.000|TR0|the most part, Arizona isn't much worse 
20110111001954.000|20110111001957.000|TR0|off for its relatively liberal gun laws 
20110111001957.000|20110111001959.000|TR0|than any other states are.
20110111001959.000|20110111002002.000|TR0|
20110111002002.000|20110111002004.000|TR0|KING:  Here's something that came up, one 
20110111002004.000|20110111002007.000|TR0|example from the last campaign, that some 
20110111002007.000|20110111002009.000|TR0|say, "A", let me be clear, nothing, 
20110111002009.000|20110111002012.000|TR0|nothing to do with this incident, but, 
20110111002012.000|20110111002015.000|TR0|"B", as an example of the kind of 
20110111002015.000|20110111002017.000|TR0|rhetoric, the kind of demonstration in 
20110111002017.000|20110111002020.000|TR0|politics that maybe everybody can take 
20110111002020.000|20110111002022.000|TR0|time and reflect on at this moment, 
20110111002022.000|20110111002025.000|TR0|because of this tragedy, and think maybe 
20110111002025.000|20110111002027.000|TR0|next time we'll do things differently.  
20110111002027.000|20110111002030.000|TR0|Jesse Kelly announcing for Congress in 
20110111002030.000|20110111002032.000|TR0|this very race, the Gabby Giffords race 
20110111002032.000|20110111002035.000|TR0|here.
20110111002035.000|20110111002037.000|TR0|
20110111002037.000|20110111002040.000|TR0|"Get on target for victory in November.  
20110111002040.000|20110111002042.000|TR0|Help remove Gabrielle Giffords from 
20110111002042.000|20110111002045.000|TR0|office.  Shoot a fully automatic M16 with 
20110111002045.000|20110111002047.000|TR0|Jesse Kelly." Essentially, a fund-raiser, 
20110111002047.000|20110111002050.000|TR0|show up, shoot an M16, get on target for 
20110111002050.000|20110111002053.000|TR0|victory.  The question is, and we use this 
20110111002053.000|20110111002055.000|TR0|in the media, so we should not criticize 
20110111002055.000|20110111002058.000|TR0|the politicians.  We say "battleground 
20110111002058.000|20110111002100.000|TR0|states".  We say "targeted districts" --
20110111002100.000|20110111002103.000|TR0|
20110111002103.000|20110111002105.000|TR0|MONTINI:  Right.
20110111002105.000|20110111002108.000|TR0|
20110111002108.000|20110111002110.000|TR0|KING:  -- so we have to be very careful in 
20110111002110.000|20110111002113.000|TR0|criticizing the politicians, but should 
20110111002113.000|20110111002115.000|TR0|all of us, all of us maybe say, whoa, 
20110111002115.000|20110111002118.000|TR0|whoa, and step back a little bit.  Or is 
20110111002118.000|20110111002120.000|TR0|there no other way --
20110111002120.000|20110111002123.000|TR0|
20110111002123.000|20110111002125.000|TR0|MONTINI:  Yes.
20110111002125.000|20110111002128.000|TR0|
20110111002128.000|20110111002131.000|TR0|KING:  -- it is -- it is races are 
20110111002131.000|20110111002133.000|TR0|targeted.
20110111002133.000|20110111002136.000|TR0|
20110111002136.000|20110111002138.000|TR0|YELLIN:  There's a difference.  Should we 
20110111002138.000|20110111002141.000|TR0|--
20110111002141.000|20110111002143.000|TR0|
20110111002143.000|20110111002146.000|TR0|MONTINI:  I think it would be a tragedy -- 
20110111002146.000|20110111002148.000|TR0|yes --
20110111002148.000|20110111002151.000|TR0|
20110111002151.000|20110111002153.000|TR0|KING:  You think it would be a tragedy?
20110111002153.000|20110111002156.000|TR0|
20110111002156.000|20110111002158.000|TR0|MONTINI:  I think it would be a tragedy if 
20110111002158.000|20110111002201.000|TR0|we didn't own up a little bit to our 
20110111002201.000|20110111002203.000|TR0|responsibility to speak in more civil 
20110111002203.000|20110111002206.000|TR0|tones throughout the media.  Not just, you 
20110111002206.000|20110111002209.000|TR0|know, politicians, community leaders, 
20110111002209.000|20110111002211.000|TR0|media members, I think we all have a 
20110111002211.000|20110111002214.000|TR0|certain responsibility in that area.  And 
20110111002214.000|20110111002216.000|TR0|I think it would be tragic if we didn't 
20110111002216.000|20110111002219.000|TR0|use this horrible event to at least have a 
20110111002219.000|20110111002221.000|TR0|discussion about that and maybe try to 
20110111002221.000|20110111002224.000|TR0|turn the corner a little bit on that.  Do 
20110111002224.000|20110111002226.000|TR0|I think that will actually happen?  I'm 
20110111002226.000|20110111002229.000|TR0|not convinced of that at all in my own 
20110111002229.000|20110111002231.000|TR0|state. Hopefully, nationally, maybe it 
20110111002231.000|20110111002234.000|TR0|will.
20110111002234.000|20110111002236.000|TR0|
20110111002236.000|20110111002239.000|TR0|KING:  You were saying it's not could we 
20110111002239.000|20110111002241.000|TR0|or should we?
20110111002241.000|20110111002244.000|TR0|
20110111002244.000|20110111002246.000|TR0|YELLIN:  Well, Governor Jan Brewer herself 
20110111002246.000|20110111002249.000|TR0|is an exceptionally polarizing figure to 
20110111002249.000|20110111002252.000|TR0|some.  And she set a good tone in that 
20110111002252.000|20110111002254.000|TR0|sense today, saying she's rising above it. 
20110111002254.000|20110111002257.000|TR0| I heard that the speaker of the House 
20110111002257.000|20110111002259.000|TR0|here set a wonderful tone in the "State of 
20110111002259.000|20110111002302.000|TR0|the State" as well, rising above it.  And 
20110111002302.000|20110111002304.000|TR0|this is an opening for President Obama, 
20110111002304.000|20110111002307.000|TR0|who introduced himself as this post 
20110111002307.000|20110111002309.000|TR0|partisan president, never really got the 
20110111002309.000|20110111002312.000|TR0|opportunity to do that, to try to do the 
20110111002312.000|20110111002314.000|TR0|same, reaching out, maybe, to John 
20110111002314.000|20110111002317.000|TR0|Boehner, who's also tried to set a lovely 
20110111002317.000|20110111002319.000|TR0|tone after this.  And see if there's a way 
20110111002319.000|20110111002322.000|TR0|to come together on the kind of rhetoric 
20110111002322.000|20110111002324.000|TR0|everybody uses in public.
20110111002324.000|20110111002327.000|TR0|
20110111002327.000|20110111002330.000|TR0|KING:  Jessie Yellin thanks.  Ed Montini, 
20110111002330.000|20110111002332.000|TR0|good to see you again. I wish it was under 
20110111002332.000|20110111002335.000|TR0|better circumstances.  We will continue 
20110111002335.000|20110111002337.000|TR0|later in the program, more of a 
20110111002337.000|20110111002340.000|TR0|conversation about the tone and the 
20110111002340.000|20110111002342.000|TR0|rhetoric in our politics.
20110111002342.000|20110111002345.000|TR0|
20110111002345.000|20110111002347.000|TR0|But up next, a closer look at the 
20110111002347.000|20110111002350.000|TR0|congresswoman clinging to life in this 
20110111002350.000|20110111002352.000|TR0|hospital, Gabrielle Giffords is a cautious 
20110111002352.000|20110111002355.000|TR0|Democrat.
20110111002355.000|20110111002357.000|TR0|
20110111002357.000|20110111002400.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110111002400.000|20110111002402.000|TR0|
20110111002402.000|20110111002405.000|TR0|KING:  Congress on your corner was what 
20110111002405.000|20110111002408.000|TR0|Gabby Giffords calls her open meetings 
20110111002408.000|20110111002410.000|TR0|when she's here in Arizona's Eighth 
20110111002410.000|20110111002413.000|TR0|Congressional District.  Authorities say 
20110111002413.000|20110111002415.000|TR0|it was at one of those sessions back in 
20110111002415.000|20110111002418.000|TR0|2007 when Jared Lee Loughner asked the 
20110111002418.000|20110111002420.000|TR0|congresswoman an odd question, about words 
20110111002420.000|20110111002423.000|TR0|and their meanings and it was at the 
20110111002423.000|20110111002425.000|TR0|beginning of a Congress on your corner 
20110111002425.000|20110111002428.000|TR0|session just this Saturday morning when 
20110111002428.000|20110111002430.000|TR0|Loughner allegedly walked up behind 
20110111002430.000|20110111002433.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords and opened fire.    
20110111002433.000|20110111002435.000|TR0|   Her doctors here at the University 
20110111002435.000|20110111002438.000|TR0|Medical Center say she isn't out of the 
20110111002438.000|20110111002440.000|TR0|woods yet, but they're cautiously 
20110111002440.000|20110111002443.000|TR0|optimistic.  One of the few people who has 
20110111002443.000|20110111002446.000|TR0|visited her daily is her campaign manager, 
20110111002446.000|20110111002448.000|TR0|Mike McNulty, who is with us tonight.  And 
20110111002448.000|20110111002451.000|TR0|just take me inside; you were in there 
20110111002451.000|20110111002453.000|TR0|again for several hours today and the 
20110111002453.000|20110111002456.000|TR0|doctors say they are optimistic; they say 
20110111002456.000|20110111002458.000|TR0|she's responding to commands.  Tell us, 
20110111002458.000|20110111002501.000|TR0|tell us exactly what that means.
20110111002501.000|20110111002503.000|TR0|
20110111002503.000|20110111002506.000|TR0|MIKE MCNULTY, REP. GIFFORDS CAMPAIGN 
20110111002506.000|20110111002508.000|TR0|CHAIRMAN:  Well, there is -- there is such 
20110111002508.000|20110111002511.000|TR0|a small chance that someone who has been 
20110111002511.000|20110111002513.000|TR0|shot through the brain will recover that 
20110111002513.000|20110111002516.000|TR0|we all started out pretty much desperate 
20110111002516.000|20110111002518.000|TR0|with grief, but the reports have been 
20110111002518.000|20110111002521.000|TR0|stupendous and encouraging and everyone is 
20110111002521.000|20110111002524.000|TR0|hopeful and, frankly, those of us that 
20110111002524.000|20110111002526.000|TR0|know her will to go on are convinced that 
20110111002526.000|20110111002529.000|TR0|she is going to pull out of this.
20110111002529.000|20110111002531.000|TR0|
20110111002531.000|20110111002534.000|TR0|KING:  When the doctors say she's 
20110111002534.000|20110111002536.000|TR0|responding, be more specific about what 
20110111002536.000|20110111002539.000|TR0|they're doing and what she is doing.
20110111002539.000|20110111002541.000|TR0|
20110111002541.000|20110111002544.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  It's simply asking her to raise 
20110111002544.000|20110111002546.000|TR0|fingers, to squeeze on their fingers.  
20110111002546.000|20110111002549.000|TR0|It's not at a point yet where they can ask 
20110111002549.000|20110111002551.000|TR0|her to talk, because she's still on a 
20110111002551.000|20110111002554.000|TR0|respirator.  But the signs that she is 
20110111002554.000|20110111002556.000|TR0|conscious are manifesting and we're very 
20110111002556.000|20110111002559.000|TR0|excited.
20110111002559.000|20110111002602.000|TR0|
20110111002602.000|20110111002604.000|TR0|KING:  And is she distinguishing between 
20110111002604.000|20110111002607.000|TR0|the different people talking to her?
20110111002607.000|20110111002609.000|TR0|
20110111002609.000|20110111002612.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  I don't know.
20110111002612.000|20110111002614.000|TR0|
20110111002614.000|20110111002617.000|TR0|KING:  You don't know that?
20110111002617.000|20110111002619.000|TR0|
20110111002619.000|20110111002622.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  No.

20110111002624.000|20110111002627.000|TR0|KING:  You don't know, what are your 
20110111002627.000|20110111002629.000|TR0|biggest questions about her health and 
20110111002629.000|20110111002632.000|TR0|prognosis?
20110111002632.000|20110111002634.000|TR0|
20110111002634.000|20110111002637.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  Whether God has bigger things 
20110111002637.000|20110111002639.000|TR0|for her in mind.  There's really -- it's 
20110111002639.000|20110111002642.000|TR0|inexplicable that she -- that we could 
20110111002642.000|20110111002645.000|TR0|actually entertain the idea that she might 
20110111002645.000|20110111002647.000|TR0|end up back in the House of 
20110111002647.000|20110111002650.000|TR0|Representatives again.  That would be a 
20110111002650.000|20110111002652.000|TR0|complete miracle.
20110111002652.000|20110111002655.000|TR0|
20110111002655.000|20110111002657.000|TR0|KING:  People say why?  Obviously, it's an 
20110111002657.000|20110111002700.000|TR0|inexplicable act. It's a heinous act, but 
20110111002700.000|20110111002702.000|TR0|people say why did this alleged assassin 
20110111002702.000|20110111002705.000|TR0|start maybe three years ago targeting 
20110111002705.000|20110111002707.000|TR0|Congresswoman Giffords.  Does anyone on 
20110111002707.000|20110111002710.000|TR0|the staff remember the question at the 
20110111002710.000|20110111002712.000|TR0|town hall three years ago, remember that 
20110111002712.000|20110111002715.000|TR0|encounter, come away with it any sort of 
20110111002715.000|20110111002717.000|TR0|wow or why?
20110111002717.000|20110111002720.000|TR0|
20110111002720.000|20110111002723.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  Not anything in anybody's mind 
20110111002723.000|20110111002725.000|TR0|brought back this guy. He was just 
20110111002725.000|20110111002728.000|TR0|anonymous.
20110111002728.000|20110111002730.000|TR0|
20110111002730.000|20110111002733.000|TR0|KING:  And nothing else in the records, no 
20110111002733.000|20110111002735.000|TR0|other -- we know there was a letter, a 
20110111002735.000|20110111002738.000|TR0|form letter essentially saying, hey, 
20110111002738.000|20110111002740.000|TR0|there's one of these events, why don't you 
20110111002740.000|20110111002743.000|TR0|come, but nothing else?  No complaints, 
20110111002743.000|20110111002745.000|TR0|nothing in the records, in the files?
20110111002745.000|20110111002748.000|TR0|
20110111002748.000|20110111002750.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  No, he disappeared.       KING:  
20110111002750.000|20110111002753.000|TR0|Nothing -- nothing.  I want to listen -- I 
20110111002753.000|20110111002755.000|TR0|first came to this district back in 2006 
20110111002755.000|20110111002758.000|TR0|when then State Senator Gabby Giffords was 
20110111002758.000|20110111002801.000|TR0|running for Congress.  And I want our 
20110111002801.000|20110111002803.000|TR0|viewers to have a better understanding, so 
20110111002803.000|20110111002806.000|TR0|let's listen to some sound from the 
20110111002806.000|20110111002808.000|TR0|congresswoman over the years, beginning my 
20110111002808.000|20110111002811.000|TR0|visit here back in 2006.

20110111002818.000|20110111002821.000|TR0|KING:  Why do you think you have a chance 
20110111002821.000|20110111002823.000|TR0|in a place that has been held by a 
20110111002823.000|20110111002826.000|TR0|Republican for quite some time?
20110111002826.000|20110111002828.000|TR0|
20110111002828.000|20110111002831.000|TR0|GIFFORDS:  Those of us that live in 
20110111002831.000|20110111002833.000|TR0|southern Arizona, particularly in the 
20110111002833.000|20110111002836.000|TR0|Eighth Congressional District, feel very, 
20110111002836.000|20110111002839.000|TR0|very discouraged and angry about the 
20110111002839.000|20110111002841.000|TR0|direction of the federal government. 
20110111002841.000|20110111002844.000|TR0|Arizonans needs reform that protects us 
20110111002844.000|20110111002846.000|TR0|from being denied coverage based on a 
20110111002846.000|20110111002849.000|TR0|pre-existing condition.  We need reform 
20110111002849.000|20110111002851.000|TR0|that guarantees care if we lose our job or 
20110111002851.000|20110111002854.000|TR0|if we move.  Arizonians need reform that 
20110111002854.000|20110111002856.000|TR0|fosters competition and delivers us, the 
20110111002856.000|20110111002859.000|TR0|customer, the lowest cost and the best

20110111002904.000|20110111002906.000|TR0|KING:  After the election, nothing on 
20110111002906.000|20110111002909.000|TR0|immigration reform until after the 
20110111002909.000|20110111002911.000|TR0|election?

20110111002914.000|20110111002917.000|TR0|GIFFORDS:  Chances are it's going to 
20110111002917.000|20110111002919.000|TR0|happen after the election. Let me tell you 
20110111002919.000|20110111002922.000|TR0|I serve on the House Armed Services 
20110111002922.000|20110111002924.000|TR0|Committee.  Last week I voted to authorize 
20110111002924.000|20110111002927.000|TR0|$760 billion in the National Defense 
20110111002927.000|20110111002929.000|TR0|Authorization Act.  That's a lot of money. 
20110111002929.000|20110111002932.000|TR0| Hundreds of billions of dollars going 
20110111002932.000|20110111002934.000|TR0|abroad securing other nation's borders, 
20110111002934.000|20110111002937.000|TR0|securing other citizens.  It is time that 
20110111002937.000|20110111002939.000|TR0|Americans are safe on their own property, 
20110111002939.000|20110111002942.000|TR0|on their own land.

20110111003010.000|20110111003012.000|TR0|KING:  It is that last snippet there, her 
20110111003012.000|20110111003015.000|TR0|speech on the House floor the day before 
20110111003015.000|20110111003017.000|TR0|she flew home when they were reading the 
20110111003017.000|20110111003020.000|TR0|Constitution and she read the First 
20110111003020.000|20110111003022.000|TR0|Amendment, the right to free speech and 
20110111003022.000|20110111003025.000|TR0|free assembly.  I don't know whether irony 
20110111003025.000|20110111003027.000|TR0|is the right word -- I don't know if there 
20110111003027.000|20110111003030.000|TR0|is a right word, but for this to happen at 
20110111003030.000|20110111003032.000|TR0|an open event like that.
20110111003032.000|20110111003035.000|TR0|
20110111003035.000|20110111003038.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  She is absolutely committed to 
20110111003038.000|20110111003040.000|TR0|giving her constituents a forum to say 
20110111003040.000|20110111003043.000|TR0|what they want to say and has been doing 
20110111003043.000|20110111003045.000|TR0|this for over four years.  She had town 
20110111003045.000|20110111003048.000|TR0|halls, even when other congresspersons 
20110111003048.000|20110111003050.000|TR0|ducked it, because she wanted her 
20110111003050.000|20110111003053.000|TR0|constituents, as vituperative as they 
20110111003053.000|20110111003055.000|TR0|might be, to have a forum to talk.  She 
20110111003055.000|20110111003058.000|TR0|thinks it's --

20110111003100.000|20110111003103.000|TR0|KING:  Did she ever talk about fear?  She 
20110111003103.000|20110111003105.000|TR0|thinks it's healthy. That was very clear.  
20110111003105.000|20110111003108.000|TR0|In the times I met her she's very 
20110111003108.000|20110111003110.000|TR0|gregarious and outgoing, talks about the 
20110111003110.000|20110111003113.000|TR0|district and getting around the district, 
20110111003113.000|20110111003116.000|TR0|but your office was targeted during the 
20110111003116.000|20110111003118.000|TR0|health care debate.  Did she ever talk 
20110111003118.000|20110111003121.000|TR0|about risk?

20110111003123.000|20110111003126.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  When she had a -- when she had a 
20110111003126.000|20110111003128.000|TR0|forum in Douglas (ph) where someone was 
20110111003128.000|20110111003131.000|TR0|protesting and their gun clattered to the 
20110111003131.000|20110111003133.000|TR0|pavement and could have gone off and shot 
20110111003133.000|20110111003136.000|TR0|somebody, it was very -- it was really a 
20110111003136.000|20110111003138.000|TR0|wake-up call.  But she's had so many 
20110111003138.000|20110111003141.000|TR0|opportunities to withdraw and avoid the 
20110111003141.000|20110111003143.000|TR0|public and has rejected all of it.  She 
20110111003143.000|20110111003146.000|TR0|just thinks that it is her job to be out 
20110111003146.000|20110111003148.000|TR0|there among the people.

20110111003219.000|20110111003221.000|TR0|and ranked her 217.  She's not just a 
20110111003221.000|20110111003224.000|TR0|centrist.  She is the center.  She is the 
20110111003224.000|20110111003226.000|TR0|fulcrum of American politics.  She is what 
20110111003226.000|20110111003229.000|TR0|people fear that there are no more of.  
20110111003229.000|20110111003232.000|TR0|People are fleeing to the left and the 
20110111003232.000|20110111003234.000|TR0|right and Gabby Giffords stands staunchly 
20110111003234.000|20110111003237.000|TR0|in the center and here we have someone has 
20110111003237.000|20110111003239.000|TR0|put a bullet through her brain.  The 
20110111003239.000|20110111003242.000|TR0|center is in trouble.
20110111003242.000|20110111003244.000|TR0|
20110111003244.000|20110111003247.000|TR0|KING:  You say the center is in trouble.  
20110111003247.000|20110111003249.000|TR0|Now, that in and of itself -- that in and 
20110111003249.000|20110111003252.000|TR0|of itself seems to you think that targeted 
20110111003252.000|20110111003254.000|TR0|because she was in the center or we don't 
20110111003254.000|20110111003257.000|TR0|know that --
20110111003257.000|20110111003259.000|TR0|
20110111003259.000|20110111003302.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20110111003302.000|20110111003304.000|TR0|
20110111003304.000|20110111003307.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  This crazy guy probably doesn't 
20110111003307.000|20110111003310.000|TR0|know anything about politics.  We don't 
20110111003310.000|20110111003312.000|TR0|know.
20110111003312.000|20110111003315.000|TR0|
20110111003315.000|20110111003317.000|TR0|KING:  But the night -- the night before 
20110111003317.000|20110111003320.000|TR0|she was shot, she wrote an e-mail to Trey 
20110111003320.000|20110111003322.000|TR0|Grayson (ph), who not many people in 
20110111003322.000|20110111003325.000|TR0|America know, but he's the former 
20110111003325.000|20110111003327.000|TR0|secretary of state in the state of 
20110111003327.000|20110111003330.000|TR0|Kentucky.  He lost the Senate primary to 
20110111003330.000|20110111003332.000|TR0|Rand Paul, and he has now been named to a 
20110111003332.000|20110111003335.000|TR0|prestigious job at the Kennedy School of 
20110111003335.000|20110111003337.000|TR0|Government in Harvard.  And she wrote an 
20110111003337.000|20110111003340.000|TR0|e-mail talking about how this is so great. 
20110111003340.000|20110111003342.000|TR0| She is praising a Republican -- this is 
20110111003342.000|20110111003345.000|TR0|so great.  I can't wait to get up to see 
20110111003345.000|20110111003347.000|TR0|you because we need to talk about ways to 
20110111003347.000|20110111003350.000|TR0|reinvigorate the center in moderation.
20110111003350.000|20110111003353.000|TR0|
20110111003353.000|20110111003355.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  I think -- I think if you 
20110111003355.000|20110111003358.000|TR0|interview Republicans in Congress you will 
20110111003358.000|20110111003400.000|TR0|find that they are comfortable working 
20110111003400.000|20110111003403.000|TR0|with her as a Democrat, far more than most 
20110111003403.000|20110111003405.000|TR0|people.
20110111003405.000|20110111003408.000|TR0|
20110111003408.000|20110111003410.000|TR0|KING:  What would she say if you could 
20110111003410.000|20110111003413.000|TR0|tell her about this? These people behind 
20110111003413.000|20110111003415.000|TR0|her, al the candles, all the prayers, all 
20110111003415.000|20110111003418.000|TR0|the gifts?
20110111003418.000|20110111003420.000|TR0|
20110111003420.000|20110111003423.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  She would find it as 
20110111003423.000|20110111003425.000|TR0|overwhelming as we do.  The people in the 
20110111003425.000|20110111003428.000|TR0|state really love her.  You can see here, 
20110111003428.000|20110111003431.000|TR0|in downtown, the north side of town, all 
20110111003431.000|20110111003433.000|TR0|over this community.  People are just 
20110111003433.000|20110111003436.000|TR0|wracked with grief.
20110111003436.000|20110111003438.000|TR0|
20110111003438.000|20110111003441.000|TR0|KING:  You mention your optimism.  There 
20110111003441.000|20110111003443.000|TR0|were a few minutes on Saturday morning 
20110111003443.000|20110111003446.000|TR0|when you thought your boss was dead.
20110111003446.000|20110111003448.000|TR0|
20110111003448.000|20110111003451.000|TR0|MCNULTY:  You know, I heard it on NPR.  
20110111003451.000|20110111003453.000|TR0|When you start out knowing -- hearing that 
20110111003453.000|20110111003456.000|TR0|someone is dead, it is devastating, anyone 
20110111003456.000|20110111003458.000|TR0|who's been through that will know that.  
20110111003458.000|20110111003501.000|TR0|And every couple of hours, a little more 
20110111003501.000|20110111003503.000|TR0|hope, a little sort of bubble of golden, 
20110111003503.000|20110111003506.000|TR0|like wishful thinking takes over.  And you 
20110111003506.000|20110111003509.000|TR0|think that maybe she'll pull through, 
20110111003509.000|20110111003511.000|TR0|despite the odds, and the odds are 
20110111003511.000|20110111003514.000|TR0|terrible.  And still, she keeps getting 
20110111003514.000|20110111003516.000|TR0|better.
20110111003516.000|20110111003519.000|TR0|
20110111003519.000|20110111003521.000|TR0|KING:  You are, and these people behind us 
20110111003521.000|20110111003524.000|TR0|are, and the country is praying for your 
20110111003524.000|20110111003526.000|TR0|boss and we wish you the best and we thank 
20110111003526.000|20110111003529.000|TR0|you for spending your time with us and 
20110111003529.000|20110111003531.000|TR0|sharing your thoughts with us..
20110111003531.000|20110111003534.000|TR0|
20110111003534.000|20110111003536.000|TR0|MCNULTY:   Thank you.
20110111003536.000|20110111003539.000|TR0|
20110111003539.000|20110111003541.000|TR0|KING:  Thank you.  Thank you.
20110111003541.000|20110111003544.000|TR0|
20110111003544.000|20110111003547.000|TR0|When we come back, we'll revisit and a 
20110111003547.000|20110111003549.000|TR0|visit a very important question for the 
20110111003549.000|20110111003552.000|TR0|country right now.  Is it time to reflect 
20110111003552.000|20110111003554.000|TR0|and tone down our political rhetoric?
20110111003554.000|20110111003557.000|TR0|
20110111003557.000|20110111003559.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110111003559.000|20110111003602.000|TR0|
20110111003602.000|20110111003604.000|TR0|KING:  One of the debates here in Arizona 
20110111003604.000|20110111003607.000|TR0|and across the country now is-no, you 
20110111003607.000|20110111003609.000|TR0|cannot connect any political rhetoric, any 
20110111003609.000|20110111003612.000|TR0|political ad, any political Web posting to 
20110111003612.000|20110111003614.000|TR0|the tragedy, the heinous act that happened 
20110111003614.000|20110111003617.000|TR0|here in Arizona.  But still, many people 
20110111003617.000|20110111003619.000|TR0|are asking the question, is it a moment 
20110111003619.000|20110111003622.000|TR0|where perhaps we should still learn a 
20110111003622.000|20110111003625.000|TR0|lesson and dial back our rhetoric and the 
20110111003625.000|20110111003627.000|TR0|vitriol in our politics.
20110111003627.000|20110111003630.000|TR0|
20110111003630.000|20110111003632.000|TR0|Let's have a conversation with two of our 
20110111003632.000|20110111003635.000|TR0|political pros: Democrat Paul Begala and 
20110111003635.000|20110111003637.000|TR0|Republican Alex Castellanos.
20110111003637.000|20110111003640.000|TR0|
20110111003640.000|20110111003642.000|TR0|Let me just start with the basic question. 
20110111003642.000|20110111003645.000|TR0| Is that an overhyped theme at the moment, 
20110111003645.000|20110111003647.000|TR0|or should we all, should we all, in 
20110111003647.000|20110111003650.000|TR0|politics, the strategists, the elected, we 
20110111003650.000|20110111003652.000|TR0|in the media, think about this?
20110111003652.000|20110111003655.000|TR0|
20110111003655.000|20110111003657.000|TR0|PAUL BEGALA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, 
20110111003657.000|20110111003700.000|TR0|John, I think we certainly have to.  
20110111003700.000|20110111003703.000|TR0|Anyone who has a megaphone has a 
20110111003703.000|20110111003705.000|TR0|responsibility. Now, that's not to say 
20110111003705.000|20110111003708.000|TR0|that any particular rhetoric caused this 
20110111003708.000|20110111003710.000|TR0|mass murder.  I'm not saying that.  I'm 
20110111003710.000|20110111003713.000|TR0|not alleging that.  I'm not accusing it.
20110111003713.000|20110111003715.000|TR0|
20110111003715.000|20110111003718.000|TR0|But we do know.  I went back and looked at 
20110111003718.000|20110111003720.000|TR0|my old boss, President Clinton, spoke on 
20110111003720.000|20110111003723.000|TR0|the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City 
20110111003723.000|20110111003725.000|TR0|terrorist attack; 168 Americans were 
20110111003725.000|20110111003728.000|TR0|murdered in an act of terrorism.  And he 
20110111003728.000|20110111003730.000|TR0|said, those of us in public life need to 
20110111003730.000|20110111003733.000|TR0|understand, our words fall on both the 
20110111003733.000|20110111003735.000|TR0|serious and the delirious.  And I think 
20110111003735.000|20110111003738.000|TR0|it's good for people like me.  And I've 
20110111003738.000|20110111003740.000|TR0|been doing that, frankly, since Gabby 
20110111003740.000|20110111003743.000|TR0|Giffords was shot.  Looked back on things 
20110111003743.000|20110111003746.000|TR0|that I've said, and I have some real 
20110111003746.000|20110111003748.000|TR0|regrets.
20110111003748.000|20110111003751.000|TR0|
20110111003751.000|20110111003753.000|TR0|I can't promise you it will be perfect, 
20110111003753.000|20110111003756.000|TR0|but I think it's really important for 
20110111003756.000|20110111003758.000|TR0|people to take a look at what they've 
20110111003758.000|20110111003801.000|TR0|said.  I've been surprised at how 
20110111003801.000|20110111003803.000|TR0|defensive the right has been.  I'm not 
20110111003803.000|20110111003806.000|TR0|saying that right-wing rhetoric caused 
20110111003806.000|20110111003808.000|TR0|this.  But I am saying that incendiary 
20110111003808.000|20110111003811.000|TR0|rhetoric can set somebody off.  We don't 
20110111003811.000|20110111003813.000|TR0|know if that's the case in this situation, 
20110111003813.000|20110111003816.000|TR0|but certainly, we all ought to take a look 
20110111003816.000|20110111003818.000|TR0|at what we say.
20110111003818.000|20110111003821.000|TR0|
20110111003821.000|20110111003824.000|TR0|ALEX CASTELLANOS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:   
20110111003824.000|20110111003826.000|TR0|John, I think all of us are concerned that 
20110111003826.000|20110111003829.000|TR0|was it something that any of us 
20110111003829.000|20110111003831.000|TR0|contributed to the culture that caused 
20110111003831.000|20110111003834.000|TR0|something like this?  There's certainly a 
20110111003834.000|20110111003836.000|TR0|sense today that America's angry.  That 
20110111003836.000|20110111003839.000|TR0|America's upset.  And it's not just anger 
20110111003839.000|20110111003841.000|TR0|on the left with MoveOn and your calling 
20110111003841.000|20110111003844.000|TR0|of George Bush Hitler, or anger on the 
20110111003844.000|20110111003846.000|TR0|right, there's plenty of that.  But a lot 
20110111003846.000|20110111003849.000|TR0|of American of the mainstream that's 
20110111003849.000|20110111003851.000|TR0|upset, too, and I think we don't want -- 
20110111003851.000|20110111003854.000|TR0|there's a government that's failing them, 
20110111003854.000|20110111003856.000|TR0|that's indebted them for years.  We don't 
20110111003856.000|20110111003859.000|TR0|want to get to a place in this country 
20110111003859.000|20110111003902.000|TR0|where we think that somehow we don't, 
20110111003902.000|20110111003904.000|TR0|we've censored ourselves from criticizing 
20110111003904.000|20110111003907.000|TR0|our own government and trying to change it 
20110111003907.000|20110111003909.000|TR0|and make it better.
20110111003909.000|20110111003912.000|TR0|
20110111003912.000|20110111003914.000|TR0|I think someone as opinionated, who is 
20110111003914.000|20110111003917.000|TR0|such a fierce fighter in Congress, and she 
20110111003917.000|20110111003919.000|TR0|believed, as Congresswoman Giffords.  I 
20110111003919.000|20110111003922.000|TR0|don't think any of our leaders would want 
20110111003922.000|20110111003924.000|TR0|to take us to that place.  The day we 
20110111003924.000|20110111003927.000|TR0|become so politically correct that we 
20110111003927.000|20110111003929.000|TR0|can't disagree vigorously, laugh at each 
20110111003929.000|20110111003932.000|TR0|other, poke some fun as well, you know, 
20110111003932.000|20110111003934.000|TR0|that's the day we become less American.
20110111003934.000|20110111003937.000|TR0|
20110111003937.000|20110111003940.000|TR0|KING:  Let's focus just on this district.  
20110111003940.000|20110111003942.000|TR0|The question is, of course we want 
20110111003942.000|20110111003945.000|TR0|vigorous debates.  And I would say we 
20110111003945.000|20110111003947.000|TR0|should have them about ideas and ideals, 
20110111003947.000|20110111003950.000|TR0|not about personal integrity, but let's 
20110111003950.000|20110111003952.000|TR0|look at this race.  Sarah Palin has been 
20110111003952.000|20110111003955.000|TR0|criticized by some because of a Web 
20110111003955.000|20110111003957.000|TR0|posting she put, where she put this 
20110111003957.000|20110111004000.000|TR0|district in the crosshairs, one of 20 
20110111004000.000|20110111004002.000|TR0|districts.  And I believe we can show 
20110111004002.000|20110111004005.000|TR0|people.  Sarah Palin's district, it's time 
20110111004005.000|20110111004007.000|TR0|to take a stand.  She targeted this 
20110111004007.000|20110111004010.000|TR0|district as a district targeted races 
20110111004010.000|20110111004012.000|TR0|across the country.
20110111004012.000|20110111004015.000|TR0|
20110111004015.000|20110111004018.000|TR0|But many conservatives say, OK, if you are 
20110111004018.000|20110111004020.000|TR0|going to criticize Sarah Palin, look at 
20110111004020.000|20110111004023.000|TR0|this.  This is from the DailyKOS.com.  Who 
20110111004023.000|20110111004025.000|TR0|the primary?  And they are showing 
20110111004025.000|20110111004028.000|TR0|Democrats that they believe, it is a 
20110111004028.000|20110111004030.000|TR0|liberal organization, that they should be 
20110111004030.000|20110111004033.000|TR0|targeted in primaries and they say she 
20110111004033.000|20110111004035.000|TR0|should be in the bull's eye, and puts a 
20110111004035.000|20110111004038.000|TR0|bull's eye.  This vote certainly puts a 
20110111004038.000|20110111004040.000|TR0|bull's eye on their district, including 
20110111004040.000|20110111004043.000|TR0|this district here.
20110111004043.000|20110111004045.000|TR0|
20110111004045.000|20110111004048.000|TR0|Paul, to you first, and then to Alex.  
20110111004048.000|20110111004050.000|TR0|It's the language here. We use sports 
20110111004050.000|20110111004053.000|TR0|metaphors a lot in politics, but we also 
20110111004053.000|20110111004056.000|TR0|use "battleground,"  "bull's eye," 
20110111004056.000|20110111004058.000|TR0|"targeting," "crosshairs."  Should we 
20110111004058.000|20110111004101.000|TR0|think again?
20110111004101.000|20110111004103.000|TR0|
20110111004103.000|20110111004106.000|TR0|BEGALA:  How about the word "campaign"?  
20110111004106.000|20110111004108.000|TR0|When I was on your show Friday, I told you 
20110111004108.000|20110111004111.000|TR0|that I had just been at the National War 
20110111004111.000|20110111004113.000|TR0|College doing a debate with our friend 
20110111004113.000|20110111004116.000|TR0|Kevin Madden, in the company of heroes. 
20110111004116.000|20110111004118.000|TR0|And Madden and I were both sheepish and 
20110111004118.000|20110111004121.000|TR0|laughing, frankly, with the soldiers and 
20110111004121.000|20110111004123.000|TR0|sailors and the airmen and the Marines, 
20110111004123.000|20110111004126.000|TR0|about how silly we political people are, 
20110111004126.000|20110111004128.000|TR0|when we say -- use the military jargon.  
20110111004128.000|20110111004131.000|TR0|But it is the jargon of the business.
20110111004131.000|20110111004133.000|TR0|
20110111004133.000|20110111004136.000|TR0|No sensible person thinks that Governor 
20110111004136.000|20110111004139.000|TR0|Palin wished any ill on Gabby Giffords.  
20110111004139.000|20110111004141.000|TR0|That's not my point.  My point is, we 
20110111004141.000|20110111004144.000|TR0|should have this vigorous debate, but you 
20110111004144.000|20110111004146.000|TR0|know, I'm a Catholic.  My faith teaches me 
20110111004146.000|20110111004149.000|TR0|to love the sinner and hate the sin, 
20110111004149.000|20110111004151.000|TR0|right?  And if you translate that to 
20110111004151.000|20110111004154.000|TR0|politics, it means have a vigorous, 
20110111004154.000|20110111004156.000|TR0|name-calling even, I guess-maybe not 
20110111004156.000|20110111004159.000|TR0|name-calling, but angry debate about ideas 
20110111004159.000|20110111004201.000|TR0|issues. But we ought to be able to dial 
20110111004201.000|20110111004204.000|TR0|back the personal attacks.
20110111004204.000|20110111004206.000|TR0|
20110111004206.000|20110111004209.000|TR0|Ten democrats, 10, received death threats 
20110111004209.000|20110111004211.000|TR0|when that health care bill was being voted 
20110111004211.000|20110111004214.000|TR0|on.  One of them had her children's lives 
20110111004214.000|20110111004217.000|TR0|threatened.  A congressman in Virginia, 
20110111004217.000|20110111004219.000|TR0|his brother had his gas line cut in the 
20110111004219.000|20110111004222.000|TR0|mistaken belief that was the congressman's 
20110111004222.000|20110111004224.000|TR0|house.  I mean that is way beyond the 
20110111004224.000|20110111004227.000|TR0|pale.  And when that happened, Republican 
20110111004227.000|20110111004229.000|TR0|leaders needed to step up-and some did.  
20110111004229.000|20110111004232.000|TR0|And step up and say that was wrong.  John 
20110111004232.000|20110111004234.000|TR0|Boehner did, to his great credit, but too 
20110111004234.000|20110111004237.000|TR0|few did not -- too many did not.
20110111004237.000|20110111004239.000|TR0|
20110111004239.000|20110111004242.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  Let's get real here a little 
20110111004242.000|20110111004244.000|TR0|bit about this. Politics should be a place 
20110111004244.000|20110111004247.000|TR0|for spirited debate, and it shouldn't just 
20110111004247.000|20110111004249.000|TR0|be about ideas.  Actually, character 
20110111004249.000|20110111004252.000|TR0|matters.  The character of our leaders 
20110111004252.000|20110111004255.000|TR0|matter.  If I'm going to give you my car 
20110111004255.000|20110111004257.000|TR0|keys to take me somewhere, I don't only 
20110111004257.000|20110111004300.000|TR0|want to know where you promise to take me, 
20110111004300.000|20110111004302.000|TR0|where you stand on issues.  I want to know 
20110111004302.000|20110111004305.000|TR0|who you are.  Can I trust you to take me 
20110111004305.000|20110111004307.000|TR0|there?  We should be able to engage in 
20110111004307.000|20110111004310.000|TR0|deep and personal and emotional debate.  
20110111004310.000|20110111004312.000|TR0|Yes, they should be mature debates. They 
20110111004312.000|20110111004315.000|TR0|should be about big and important things.
20110111004315.000|20110111004317.000|TR0|
20110111004317.000|20110111004320.000|TR0|There's certainly no place in politics 
20110111004320.000|20110111004322.000|TR0|for, you know, actual physical personal 
20110111004322.000|20110111004325.000|TR0|attacks.  But the day we stop allowing 
20110111004325.000|20110111004327.000|TR0|ourselves to challenge each other's-in the 
20110111004327.000|20110111004330.000|TR0|strongest ways-about these big issues, 
20110111004330.000|20110111004333.000|TR0|we're deciding what kind of country we're 
20110111004333.000|20110111004335.000|TR0|going to be.  You know, Paul would rather 
20110111004335.000|20110111004338.000|TR0|have us be a more European-style social 
20110111004338.000|20110111004340.000|TR0|democracy.  God bless, Paul.  Wonderful 
20110111004340.000|20110111004343.000|TR0|guy.  He's a little bit mistaken about 
20110111004343.000|20110111004345.000|TR0|that. The day we can't challenge each 
20110111004345.000|20110111004348.000|TR0|other, and not only do it emotionally, but 
20110111004348.000|20110111004350.000|TR0|have fun with it, and actually care about 
20110111004350.000|20110111004353.000|TR0|these things.  Thank God we live in a 
20110111004353.000|20110111004355.000|TR0|place where we can care enough to disagree 
20110111004355.000|20110111004358.000|TR0|and are allowed to do so.
20110111004358.000|20110111004400.000|TR0|

20110111004504.000|20110111004506.000|TR0|what next from this.  Let's check in with

20110111004519.000|20110111004521.000|TR0|political climate?

20110111004526.000|20110111004529.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  You know, I heard a lot of 
20110111004529.000|20110111004532.000|TR0|members of Congress on both sides of the 
20110111004532.000|20110111004534.000|TR0|aisle say that they do hope this is more 
20110111004534.000|20110111004537.000|TR0|than temporary.  This being the change we 
20110111004537.000|20110111004539.000|TR0|really are seeing in terms of tone and 
20110111004539.000|20110111004542.000|TR0|tenor.  Take a look at this picture.  
20110111004542.000|20110111004544.000|TR0|There was a moment of silence here in 
20110111004544.000|20110111004547.000|TR0|Washington today. When that happened, 
20110111004547.000|20110111004549.000|TR0|hundreds of mostly staffers, but also some 
20110111004549.000|20110111004552.000|TR0|members of Congress, from both parties, 
20110111004552.000|20110111004554.000|TR0|gathered on the steps of the House.
20110111004554.000|20110111004557.000|TR0|
20110111004557.000|20110111004559.000|TR0|And somebody who was there was Emanuel 
20110111004559.000|20110111004602.000|TR0|Cleaver.  He's the new chairman of the 
20110111004602.000|20110111004604.000|TR0|Congressional Black Caucus.  He's also a 
20110111004604.000|20110111004607.000|TR0|minister.  He gave an impromptu prayer 
20110111004607.000|20110111004610.000|TR0|there.  And afterwards, I talked to him.  
20110111004610.000|20110111004612.000|TR0|And he said he sure hopes that things 
20110111004612.000|20110111004615.000|TR0|change here when it comes to the rhetoric 
20110111004615.000|20110111004617.000|TR0|from both parties.

20110111004625.000|20110111004627.000|TR0|REP. EMANUEL CLEAVER, (D) MISSOURI:  
20110111004627.000|20110111004630.000|TR0|Hopefully, this is a transformative 
20110111004630.000|20110111004632.000|TR0|moment.  If it isn't, it should be.  
20110111004632.000|20110111004635.000|TR0|Whether the shooter was inspired by speech 
20110111004635.000|20110111004637.000|TR0|or not, to do his dastardly deeds is 
20110111004637.000|20110111004640.000|TR0|irrelevant.  The truth of the matter is, 
20110111004640.000|20110111004642.000|TR0|the tone is toxic here in Washington and I 
20110111004642.000|20110111004645.000|TR0|think we've been exporting it around the 
20110111004645.000|20110111004648.000|TR0|country.
20110111004648.000|20110111004650.000|TR0|
20110111004650.000|20110111004653.000|TR0|What happens when you're toxic?  Your 
20110111004653.000|20110111004655.000|TR0|colleagues walk up and pat you on the 
20110111004655.000|20110111004658.000|TR0|back, boy, that was good, you called him, 
20110111004658.000|20110111004700.000|TR0|you called her such a good name.  And 
20110111004700.000|20110111004703.000|TR0|that's celebrated.
20110111004703.000|20110111004705.000|TR0|
20110111004705.000|20110111004708.000|TR0|BASH:  You see that happen?

20110111004720.000|20110111004723.000|TR0|BASH:  Every day, he sees that happening.  
20110111004723.000|20110111004726.000|TR0|And John, he said to me, quote, "Democrats 
20110111004726.000|20110111004728.000|TR0|say dumb the things too."  Anybody who 
20110111004728.000|20110111004731.000|TR0|thinks it's just the Republicans, they 
20110111004731.000|20110111004733.000|TR0|don't know what they're talking about. And 
20110111004733.000|20110111004736.000|TR0|he hopes that this is a time that they 
20110111004736.000|20110111004738.000|TR0|change.  I heard the same sentiment from 
20110111004738.000|20110111004741.000|TR0|some senior Republicans I talked to as 
20110111004741.000|20110111004743.000|TR0|well.
20110111004743.000|20110111004746.000|TR0|
20110111004746.000|20110111004748.000|TR0|KING:  And what are they saying -- 
20110111004748.000|20110111004751.000|TR0|initially right after the shooting, there 
20110111004751.000|20110111004753.000|TR0|was a lot of talk, do we need more 
20110111004753.000|20110111004756.000|TR0|security for members of Congress?  In 
20110111004756.000|20110111004758.000|TR0|recent hours more saying, well, we can't 
20110111004758.000|20110111004801.000|TR0|do that.  What is the sense?  Do they need 
20110111004801.000|20110111004804.000|TR0|more, or do they just have to move on from 
20110111004804.000|20110111004806.000|TR0|this?
20110111004806.000|20110111004809.000|TR0|
20110111004809.000|20110111004811.000|TR0|BASH:  Most of the people I talked to, 
20110111004811.000|20110111004814.000|TR0|members of Congress, say it is going to be 
20110111004814.000|20110111004816.000|TR0|very, very difficult.  The reality is it 
20110111004816.000|20110111004819.000|TR0|is going to be very difficult to give 
20110111004819.000|20110111004821.000|TR0|members of Congress more security.  But 
20110111004821.000|20110111004824.000|TR0|they are taking it on a case-by-case basis.
20110111004824.000|20110111004826.000|TR0|
20110111004826.000|20110111004829.000|TR0|And after this happened, more information 
20110111004829.000|20110111004831.000|TR0|has come out about other incidents that we 
20110111004831.000|20110111004834.000|TR0|never knew about.  One member of Congress 
20110111004834.000|20110111004836.000|TR0|in Pennsylvania telling me there was a 
20110111004836.000|20110111004839.000|TR0|threat, a serious death threat against 
20110111004839.000|20110111004841.000|TR0|someone on their staff.  They got law 
20110111004841.000|20110111004844.000|TR0|enforcement to help them.  And it does 
20110111004844.000|20110111004847.000|TR0|happen more frequently than we realize.  
20110111004847.000|20110111004849.000|TR0|But people are going to be more vigilant.  
20110111004849.000|20110111004852.000|TR0|I heard that from every member of Congress 
20110111004852.000|20110111004854.000|TR0|I talked to today.

20110111004912.000|20110111004914.000|TR0|President Obama, we are told, will travel 
20110111004914.000|20110111004917.000|TR0|right here to Arizona on Wednesday.  
20110111004917.000|20110111004919.000|TR0|Arizona on Wednesday, the president of the 
20110111004919.000|20110111004922.000|TR0|United States coming to this state as he 
20110111004922.000|20110111004925.000|TR0|deals with this tragedy.  CNN, of course,

20110111004935.000|20110111004937.000|TR0|this community.  How much of a shock?  How 
20110111004937.000|20110111004940.000|TR0|will it affect the politics?  I sat down 
20110111004940.000|20110111004942.000|TR0|today with the leaders of the Democratic 
20110111004942.000|20110111004945.000|TR0|Party, the Republican Party, and the Tea

20110111005000.000|20110111005003.000|TR0|of Saturday's shooting. To try to get a 
20110111005003.000|20110111005005.000|TR0|sense of how it would impact the political 
20110111005005.000|20110111005008.000|TR0|discourse, impact the community, I sat 
20110111005008.000|20110111005010.000|TR0|down today with three political leaders. 
20110111005010.000|20110111005013.000|TR0|They have very different views, but on 
20110111005013.000|20110111005015.000|TR0|some issues, they're united. The leader of 
20110111005015.000|20110111005018.000|TR0|the Democratic Party, the Republican 
20110111005018.000|20110111005020.000|TR0|Party, and the Tea Party; we sat down at a 
20110111005020.000|20110111005023.000|TR0|restaurant here, a wonderful restaurant, 
20110111005023.000|20110111005025.000|TR0|called Abeuro Canello (ph).

20110111005038.000|20110111005041.000|TR0|never seen an ad by a congressman with a 
20110111005041.000|20110111005043.000|TR0|gun.  We saw two Republican candidates 
20110111005043.000|20110111005046.000|TR0|this year in Arizona film ads with 
20110111005046.000|20110111005048.000|TR0|automatic weapons.  We saw a third, Jesse 
20110111005048.000|20110111005051.000|TR0|Kelly, have a fundraiser where he said 
20110111005051.000|20110111005053.000|TR0|come shoot an automatic weapon with your 
20110111005053.000|20110111005056.000|TR0|candidate.  It has some words about 
20110111005056.000|20110111005058.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords in that ad.  I think 
20110111005058.000|20110111005101.000|TR0|it's fair to say that I've been here 31 
20110111005101.000|20110111005103.000|TR0|years.  I haven't seen a campaign like 
20110111005103.000|20110111005106.000|TR0|this one in 2009.  It started right after 
20110111005106.000|20110111005108.000|TR0|the inauguration, the heated rhetoric 
20110111005108.000|20110111005111.000|TR0|coming from various sources.  We haven't 
20110111005111.000|20110111005113.000|TR0|seen this kind of rhetoric in my 31 years 
20110111005113.000|20110111005116.000|TR0|in Arizona.

20110111005121.000|20110111005124.000|TR0|REPUBLICAN PARTY:  I would like to say I 
20110111005124.000|20110111005126.000|TR0|think, again, this is a -- if there's a 
20110111005126.000|20110111005129.000|TR0|teachable moment, it's this.  We talk 
20110111005129.000|20110111005131.000|TR0|about how we want to lower the heat, lower 
20110111005131.000|20110111005134.000|TR0|the vitriol, but again, you can't do that, 
20110111005134.000|20110111005136.000|TR0|and then keep pointing fingers at people 
20110111005136.000|20110111005139.000|TR0|when we have no idea what the motive was 
20110111005139.000|20110111005141.000|TR0|behind the shooter, what his motive was.
20110111005141.000|20110111005144.000|TR0|
20110111005144.000|20110111005146.000|TR0|That's why I think it was irresponsible 
20110111005146.000|20110111005149.000|TR0|for public officials to make comments on 
20110111005149.000|20110111005151.000|TR0|this.  There's obviously an ongoing 
20110111005151.000|20110111005154.000|TR0|investigation. The fact is that random or 
20110111005154.000|20110111005157.000|TR0|isolated acts of violence have always 
20110111005157.000|20110111005159.000|TR0|occurred and they will always occur.
20110111005159.000|20110111005202.000|TR0|
20110111005202.000|20110111005204.000|TR0|TRENT HUMPHRIES, ORGANIZER, TUCSON TEA 
20110111005204.000|20110111005207.000|TR0|PARTY:  Let's be honest, too.  At my home 
20110111005207.000|20110111005209.000|TR0|before we did this meeting, I had a 
20110111005209.000|20110111005212.000|TR0|representative from the sheriff's office 
20110111005212.000|20110111005214.000|TR0|at my home, because after the sheriff made 
20110111005214.000|20110111005217.000|TR0|his remarks, I got a lot of hate mail.  
20110111005217.000|20110111005219.000|TR0|People saying that I wish it would have 
20110111005219.000|20110111005222.000|TR0|been your family instead of this family 
20110111005222.000|20110111005224.000|TR0|that was killed. You have blood on your 
20110111005224.000|20110111005227.000|TR0|hands.
20110111005227.000|20110111005229.000|TR0|
20110111005229.000|20110111005232.000|TR0|One of the people killed was my neighbor 
20110111005232.000|20110111005234.000|TR0|who lives just down the street from me.  
20110111005234.000|20110111005237.000|TR0|His wife was shot, too, and she's in the 
20110111005237.000|20110111005240.000|TR0|hospital. This is personal.  This was my 
20110111005240.000|20110111005242.000|TR0|neighborhood that this happened in.  To 
20110111005242.000|20110111005245.000|TR0|see those things, you know, this -- this 
20110111005245.000|20110111005247.000|TR0|goes way beyond politics. Right now is the 
20110111005247.000|20110111005250.000|TR0|time for the national people to back off, 
20110111005250.000|20110111005252.000|TR0|let us mourn, let us handle this, and get 
20110111005252.000|20110111005255.000|TR0|the investigation done.  And then if 
20110111005255.000|20110111005257.000|TR0|there's things to be taken -- if there's 
20110111005257.000|20110111005300.000|TR0|things that went wrong, if there are 
20110111005300.000|20110111005302.000|TR0|things that could have been done 
20110111005302.000|20110111005305.000|TR0|differently, let's talk about that.  But 
20110111005305.000|20110111005307.000|TR0|allow us to mourn.
20110111005307.000|20110111005310.000|TR0|
20110111005310.000|20110111005312.000|TR0|KING:  You say allow us - it is your 
20110111005312.000|20110111005315.000|TR0|community.  This is "The New York Times", 
20110111005315.000|20110111005318.000|TR0|not a community newspaper, a national 
20110111005318.000|20110111005320.000|TR0|newspaper.  A harsh spotlight on the 
20110111005320.000|20110111005323.000|TR0|state's politics.  Arizona has been a -- a 
20110111005323.000|20110111005325.000|TR0|frontier, an emotional frontier, in very 
20110111005325.000|20110111005328.000|TR0|tough issues, particularly the immigration 
20110111005328.000|20110111005330.000|TR0|debate.  Which, again, somebody in New 
20110111005330.000|20110111005333.000|TR0|York City or somebody in North Carolina is 
20110111005333.000|20110111005335.000|TR0|not going to understand what it's like to 
20110111005335.000|20110111005338.000|TR0|live in a border community, to understand 
20110111005338.000|20110111005340.000|TR0|what has gone on in recent years.
20110111005340.000|20110111005343.000|TR0|
20110111005343.000|20110111005345.000|TR0|What, you say, we should back off.  You 
20110111005345.000|20110111005348.000|TR0|include me in that, I assume, and I 
20110111005348.000|20110111005350.000|TR0|completely understand.  What does it do to 
20110111005350.000|20110111005353.000|TR0|you when you see that?
20110111005353.000|20110111005356.000|TR0|
20110111005356.000|20110111005358.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  You know, it's -- again, there 
20110111005358.000|20110111005401.000|TR0|will be a time to have these discussions.  
20110111005401.000|20110111005403.000|TR0|It will be happening.  But right now, Paul 
20110111005403.000|20110111005406.000|TR0|Krugman immediately after the thing comes 
20110111005406.000|20110111005408.000|TR0|out with blaming Rush Limbaugh, Glenn 
20110111005408.000|20110111005411.000|TR0|Beck, TV, all of those things right away.  
20110111005411.000|20110111005413.000|TR0|That was not helpful. You talk about harsh 
20110111005413.000|20110111005416.000|TR0|discussions.  Where there's a line drawn 
20110111005416.000|20110111005418.000|TR0|on one side, there has to be 
20110111005418.000|20110111005421.000|TR0|responsibility taken on both sides.  All 
20110111005421.000|20110111005423.000|TR0|of that mail in my inbox came almost 
20110111005423.000|20110111005426.000|TR0|directly from the comments the sheriff 
20110111005426.000|20110111005428.000|TR0|made, and people blaming my organization 
20110111005428.000|20110111005431.000|TR0|for what happened.  Nobody in this city, 
20110111005431.000|20110111005434.000|TR0|nobody in this town, that knows me and my 
20110111005434.000|20110111005436.000|TR0|organization, believes that to be the 
20110111005436.000|20110111005439.000|TR0|case.  Probably not even Jeff Rogers.
20110111005439.000|20110111005441.000|TR0|
20110111005441.000|20110111005444.000|TR0|ROGERS:  I concur.  We've seen some really 
20110111005444.000|20110111005446.000|TR0|nasty, horrible things emanate from some 
20110111005446.000|20110111005449.000|TR0|of these Tea Party people across the 
20110111005449.000|20110111005451.000|TR0|nation, but we haven't seen that here in 
20110111005451.000|20110111005454.000|TR0|Tucson.  Remarkably, in this state, this 
20110111005454.000|20110111005456.000|TR0|is probably one of the most sort of calm, 
20110111005456.000|20110111005459.000|TR0|civilized places in this state. I mean, we 
20110111005459.000|20110111005501.000|TR0|-- we have legitimate policy differences 
20110111005501.000|20110111005504.000|TR0|between the three of us sitting here, but 
20110111005504.000|20110111005506.000|TR0|we're able, on a daily basis, to discuss 
20110111005506.000|20110111005509.000|TR0|them in a kind and gentle manner.  And 
20110111005509.000|20110111005512.000|TR0|oftentimes we find ourselves in agreement 
20110111005512.000|20110111005514.000|TR0|on some things that surprise folks.
20110111005514.000|20110111005517.000|TR0|
20110111005517.000|20110111005519.000|TR0|But, you know, this community, Tucson, is 
20110111005519.000|20110111005522.000|TR0|a very close-knit community and not 
20110111005522.000|20110111005524.000|TR0|typical of the rest of the state in some 
20110111005524.000|20110111005527.000|TR0|degrees.
20110111005527.000|20110111005529.000|TR0|
20110111005529.000|20110111005532.000|TR0|MILLER:  I would also say I think one of 
20110111005532.000|20110111005534.000|TR0|the assumptions we're making is that 
20110111005534.000|20110111005537.000|TR0|people in politics have all the answers.  
20110111005537.000|20110111005539.000|TR0|I would argue this is primarily a -- a 
20110111005539.000|20110111005542.000|TR0|cultural thing.  And politics reflects 
20110111005542.000|20110111005544.000|TR0|culture far more than the other way 
20110111005544.000|20110111005547.000|TR0|around.  And you have this happen. And no 
20110111005547.000|20110111005550.000|TR0|policy, no law, no -- nobody in a suit is 
20110111005550.000|20110111005552.000|TR0|ever going to have the answer to make 
20110111005552.000|20110111005555.000|TR0|something like this stop.  This is a 
20110111005555.000|20110111005557.000|TR0|cultural thing.  And it's up to every 
20110111005557.000|20110111005600.000|TR0|individual to take responsibility for the 
20110111005600.000|20110111005602.000|TR0|state of our culture and our -- you know, 
20110111005602.000|20110111005605.000|TR0|our religious leaders, our community 
20110111005605.000|20110111005607.000|TR0|leaders, our club leaders.       KING:  
20110111005607.000|20110111005610.000|TR0|You make an interesting point in the sense 
20110111005610.000|20110111005612.000|TR0|that, again, it is perhaps inevitable and 
20110111005612.000|20110111005615.000|TR0|reflects on society and particularly the 
20110111005615.000|20110111005617.000|TR0|political system that one of the 
20110111005617.000|20110111005620.000|TR0|conversations that immediately happens is 
20110111005620.000|20110111005622.000|TR0|about guns.  You see comparisons now that 
20110111005622.000|20110111005625.000|TR0|you had a student who clearly showed 
20110111005625.000|20110111005627.000|TR0|unstable behavior, irresponsible behavior, 
20110111005627.000|20110111005630.000|TR0|some viewed it as threatening behavior in 
20110111005630.000|20110111005633.000|TR0|the classroom.  How come nobody connected 
20110111005633.000|20110111005635.000|TR0|the dots?  That was in June, July of last 
20110111005635.000|20110111005638.000|TR0|year, he bought the gun in November.  How 
20110111005638.000|20110111005640.000|TR0|come nobody connected the dots and somehow 
20110111005640.000|20110111005643.000|TR0|prevented this guy from buying a gun?  Can 
20110111005643.000|20110111005645.000|TR0|you legislate that?  People said that 
20110111005645.000|20110111005648.000|TR0|after Virginia Tech.  They're saying it 
20110111005648.000|20110111005650.000|TR0|now.
20110111005650.000|20110111005653.000|TR0|
20110111005653.000|20110111005655.000|TR0|ROGERS:  I think it was justifiable to say 
20110111005655.000|20110111005658.000|TR0|it after Virginia Tech.  As we conduct the 
20110111005658.000|20110111005700.000|TR0|autopsy on that killing, we saw that there 
20110111005700.000|20110111005703.000|TR0|were a -- that information was available 
20110111005703.000|20110111005705.000|TR0|to officials and they should have acted on 
20110111005705.000|20110111005708.000|TR0|it.  I don't think that's the case here.  
20110111005708.000|20110111005711.000|TR0|Unless something more surfaces, from what 
20110111005711.000|20110111005713.000|TR0|we know so far, this was a man who some 
20110111005713.000|20110111005716.000|TR0|had troubled moments at Pima College and 
20110111005716.000|20110111005718.000|TR0|hopefully somebody would have done more 
20110111005718.000|20110111005721.000|TR0|than they did, but there really wasn't 
20110111005721.000|20110111005723.000|TR0|anything there officially to classify this 
20110111005723.000|20110111005726.000|TR0|person as being a prohibited obssessor 
20110111005726.000|20110111005728.000|TR0|(ph).
20110111005728.000|20110111005731.000|TR0|
20110111005731.000|20110111005733.000|TR0|So, we could say the system is imperfect, 
20110111005733.000|20110111005736.000|TR0|and I agree, but where -- what do we do 
20110111005736.000|20110111005738.000|TR0|next to make it more perfect?  And you do 
20110111005738.000|20110111005741.000|TR0|have to realize this is, as David 
20110111005741.000|20110111005743.000|TR0|Fitzsimmons, the cartoonist, that Trent 
20110111005743.000|20110111005746.000|TR0|mentioned, this is a serious gun culture 
20110111005746.000|20110111005749.000|TR0|in this state, and it is a little over the 
20110111005749.000|20110111005751.000|TR0|top.  When you can have guns in bars and 
20110111005751.000|20110111005754.000|TR0|now they're proposing our -- the people 
20110111005754.000|20110111005756.000|TR0|running our legislature now to allow guns 
20110111005756.000|20110111005759.000|TR0|on school campuses, we're -- it's 
20110111005759.000|20110111005801.000|TR0|troubling.  And hopefully this is another 
20110111005801.000|20110111005804.000|TR0|moment that we can go, wait a minute here. 
20110111005804.000|20110111005806.000|TR0| Perhaps we're going too far in this state 
20110111005806.000|20110111005809.000|TR0|with our liberal gun laws.

20110111005811.000|20110111005814.000|TR0|MILLER:  Well, there again, Jeff wants to 
20110111005814.000|20110111005816.000|TR0|get into politics.  I think there is a 
20110111005816.000|20110111005819.000|TR0|time for that.  I just don't think it is 
20110111005819.000|20110111005821.000|TR0|now.  There will be time when Brian and 
20110111005821.000|20110111005824.000|TR0|Jeff, we will go toe-to-toe, on the gun 
20110111005824.000|20110111005827.000|TR0|issue.  It's 48 hours later.  And it's -- 
20110111005827.000|20110111005829.000|TR0|I don't just see it's the time right now.

20110111005832.000|20110111005834.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  Yeah.  Again, you know, 
20110111005834.000|20110111005837.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords, herself, there's 
20110111005837.000|20110111005839.000|TR0|pictures of her on her website firing 
20110111005839.000|20110111005842.000|TR0|automatic weapons.  She owned a Glock.  
20110111005842.000|20110111005844.000|TR0|It's something maybe other states don't 
20110111005844.000|20110111005847.000|TR0|understand, but gun ownership is a very, 
20110111005847.000|20110111005849.000|TR0|very --
20110111005849.000|20110111005852.000|TR0|
20110111005852.000|20110111005854.000|TR0|MILLER:  And he could have legally owned a 
20110111005854.000|20110111005857.000|TR0|weapon in any 50 states.  So, it has 
20110111005857.000|20110111005859.000|TR0|nothing to do specifically with Arizona.

20110111005907.000|20110111005910.000|TR0|KING:  As you see, some disagreements 
20110111005910.000|20110111005912.000|TR0|there between the Democrats, the 
20110111005912.000|20110111005915.000|TR0|Republicans and the Tea Party, but polite, 
20110111005915.000|20110111005917.000|TR0|civil disagreements by three men who 
20110111005917.000|20110111005920.000|TR0|respect each other.  That's the way it 
20110111005920.000|20110111005922.000|TR0|ought to be.  As we leave you tonight, 
20110111005922.000|20110111005925.000|TR0|look at the remarkable scene behind me, 
20110111005925.000|20110111005927.000|TR0|still vigils under way, people coming by 
20110111005927.000|20110111005930.000|TR0|to leave gifts for Congresswoman Gabby 
20110111005930.000|20110111005932.000|TR0|Giffords, and others recovering in this 
20110111005932.000|20110111005935.000|TR0|hospital. It is a remarkable scene as we 
20110111005935.000|20110111005937.000|TR0|leave you tonight and say goodnight. We'll 
20110111005937.000|20110111005940.000|TR0|see you tomorrow.
