20110127141954.666|20110127141956.495|TR0|lamps outside shining through 
20110127141956.495|20110127141958.325|TR0|the very thick grates, and 
20110127141958.325|20110127142000.155|TR0|they're illuminating people with 
20110127142000.155|20110127142001.984|TR0|blood on their faces, bruises 
20110127142001.984|20110127142003.814|TR0|all over them. Some people are 
20110127142003.814|20110127142005.644|TR0|curled up in the corner praying. 
20110127142005.644|20110127142007.474|TR0|Others are desperately trying to 
20110127142007.474|20110127142009.303|TR0|use cell phones.
20110127142009.303|20110127142011.133|TR0|
20110127142011.133|20110127142012.963|TR0|All of us, including me, had our 
20110127142012.963|20110127142014.792|TR0|cell phones removed, but some of 
20110127142014.792|20110127142016.622|TR0|them obviously had more than 
20110127142016.622|20110127142018.452|TR0|one, and that got missed by the 
20110127142018.452|20110127142020.281|TR0|police. But most of the phones 
20110127142020.281|20110127142022.111|TR0|aren't working, and there's a 
20110127142022.111|20110127142023.941|TR0|desperate struggle for the ones 
20110127142023.941|20110127142025.770|TR0|that are, for people to phone 
20110127142025.770|20110127142027.600|TR0|loved ones and tell them that 
20110127142027.600|20110127142029.430|TR0|they're being taken away.
20110127142029.430|20110127142031.260|TR0|
20110127142031.260|20110127142033.089|TR0|People are suggesting that there 
20110127142033.089|20110127142034.919|TR0|could be a number of outcomes, 
20110127142034.919|20110127142036.749|TR0|that they could be taking us 
20110127142036.749|20110127142038.578|TR0|away to torture and question us 
20110127142038.578|20110127142040.408|TR0|over the burning of a police 
20110127142040.408|20110127142042.238|TR0|truck, which is what was going 
20110127142042.238|20110127142044.067|TR0|on when I was grabbed by state 
20110127142044.067|20110127142045.897|TR0|security. I was just about 20 
20110127142045.897|20110127142047.727|TR0|meters from it, and they stormed 
20110127142047.727|20110127142049.557|TR0|unexpectedly and took everybody 
20110127142049.557|20110127142051.386|TR0|around it. Or they may have had 
20110127142051.386|20110127142053.216|TR0|orders to release us, in which 
20110127142053.216|20110127142055.046|TR0|case the standard thing for the 
20110127142055.046|20110127142056.875|TR0|police to do is to take us right 
20110127142056.875|20110127142058.705|TR0|out dozens of miles into the 
20110127142058.705|20110127142100.535|TR0|desert, extort us all the money 
20110127142100.535|20110127142102.364|TR0|we're worth, and then leave us 
20110127142102.364|20110127142104.194|TR0|by the side of the road with no 
20110127142104.194|20110127142106.024|TR0|phones, no money and several 
20110127142106.024|20110127142107.854|TR0|dozen miles outside of the city. 
20110127142107.854|20110127142109.683|TR0|So, we're waiting to see what's 
20110127142109.683|20110127142111.513|TR0|happening.
20110127142111.513|20110127142113.343|TR0|
20110127142113.343|20110127142115.172|TR0|And despite the fact that we've 
20110127142115.172|20110127142117.002|TR0|all been arrested and beaten, 
20110127142117.002|20110127142118.832|TR0|there's still a huge amount of 
20110127142118.832|20110127142120.661|TR0|excitement over what we've seen 
20110127142120.661|20110127142122.491|TR0|today in the protests in South 
20110127142122.491|20110127142124.321|TR0|Tahrir. So, we'll see how this 
20110127142124.321|20110127142126.151|TR0|plays out.
20110127142126.151|20110127142127.980|TR0|
20110127142127.980|20110127142129.810|TR0|People are banging on the - 
20110127142129.810|20110127142131.640|TR0|we've come to a stop, and people 
20110127142131.640|20110127142133.469|TR0|were banging again and again on 
20110127142133.469|20110127142135.299|TR0|the walls, protest. And the 
20110127142135.299|20110127142137.129|TR0|truck is now doing quick spurts 
20110127142137.129|20110127142138.958|TR0|forward and stopping to throw us 
20110127142138.958|20110127142140.788|TR0|all around. And people are 
20110127142140.788|20110127142142.618|TR0|saying now we will definitely 
20110127142142.618|20110127142144.447|TR0|get beaten. It's all very 
20110127142144.447|20110127142146.277|TR0|confusing. And we still have 
20110127142146.277|20110127142148.107|TR0|several injured people in here 
20110127142148.107|20110127142149.937|TR0|losing blood.
20110127142149.937|20110127142151.766|TR0|
20110127142151.766|20110127142153.596|TR0|People are banging and screaming 
20110127142153.596|20110127142155.426|TR0|to be let out. There is a young 
20110127142155.426|20110127142157.255|TR0|man who has completely 
20110127142157.255|20110127142159.085|TR0|collapsed. He seems to be - he 
20110127142159.085|20110127142200.915|TR0|seems to be struggling for 
20110127142200.915|20110127142202.744|TR0|breath. And it actually looks 
20110127142202.744|20110127142204.574|TR0|very serious. He's looking 
20110127142204.574|20110127142206.404|TR0|desperately ill. He's collapsed 
20110127142206.404|20110127142208.234|TR0|on the bench. People are around 
20110127142208.234|20110127142210.063|TR0|him trying to give him air. 
20110127142210.063|20110127142211.893|TR0|They're taking off his shirt in 
20110127142211.893|20110127142213.723|TR0|an attempt to, I think, make 
20110127142213.723|20110127142215.552|TR0|sure that he can breathe OK. And 
20110127142215.552|20110127142217.382|TR0|meanwhile, people on the other 
20110127142217.382|20110127142219.212|TR0|side of this truck are screaming 
20110127142219.212|20110127142221.041|TR0|out the windows, saying, "We 
20110127142221.041|20110127142222.871|TR0|have an injured person, a dying 
20110127142222.871|20110127142224.701|TR0|person in here. We need help!" 
20110127142224.701|20110127142226.531|TR0|And yet, still, we're still 
20110127142226.531|20110127142228.360|TR0|locked inside, and nothing is 
20110127142228.360|20110127142230.190|TR0|happening.
20110127142230.190|20110127142232.020|TR0|
20110127142232.020|20110127142233.849|TR0|They're screaming now, "A man is 
20110127142233.849|20110127142235.679|TR0|dying! A man is dying!" And the 
20110127142235.679|20110127142237.509|TR0|door has been forced open. And 
20110127142237.509|20110127142239.338|TR0|there was a surge forward to get 
20110127142239.338|20110127142241.168|TR0|out of the door, but now people 
20110127142241.168|20110127142242.998|TR0|are holding back so that the man 
20110127142242.998|20110127142244.828|TR0|who is suffering desperately 
20110127142244.828|20110127142246.657|TR0|from a diabetes coma can get 
20110127142246.657|20110127142248.487|TR0|through. But the police are at 
20110127142248.487|20110127142250.317|TR0|the door. They're not letting 
20110127142250.317|20110127142252.146|TR0|people out. In fact, they're 
20110127142252.146|20110127142253.976|TR0|beating people.
20110127142253.976|20110127142255.806|TR0|
20110127142255.806|20110127142257.635|TR0|The door is open. People are 
20110127142257.635|20110127142259.465|TR0|being hauled out by police, 
20110127142259.465|20110127142301.295|TR0|beaten. Someone next to me is 
20110127142301.295|20110127142303.125|TR0|collapsing from the heat and 
20110127142303.125|20110127142304.954|TR0|beating. And meanwhile, the 
20110127142304.954|20110127142306.784|TR0|whole truck is being rocked and 
20110127142306.784|20110127142308.614|TR0|shaken. It's completely 
20110127142308.614|20110127142310.443|TR0|disorientating and very 
20110127142310.443|20110127142312.273|TR0|confusing and quite a bit 
20110127142312.273|20110127142314.103|TR0|intimidating. The whole truck is 
20110127142314.103|20110127142315.932|TR0|swaying from side to side. 
20110127142315.932|20110127142317.762|TR0|People are screaming outside. 
20110127142317.762|20110127142319.592|TR0|It's very unclear what the 
20110127142319.592|20110127142321.421|TR0|situation is.
20110127142321.421|20110127142323.251|TR0|
20110127142323.251|20110127142325.081|TR0|And now, suddenly, suddenly the 
20110127142325.081|20110127142326.911|TR0|police seem to have fallen back, 
20110127142326.911|20110127142328.740|TR0|and we're charging out of the 
20110127142328.740|20110127142330.570|TR0|truck. The man who has fallen 
20110127142330.570|20110127142332.400|TR0|into the diabetes coma has been 
20110127142332.400|20110127142334.229|TR0|carried out. And now we are all 
20110127142334.229|20110127142336.059|TR0|- we are all now following. 
20110127142336.059|20110127142337.889|TR0|There's a push and a crush to go 
20110127142337.889|20110127142339.718|TR0|through this incredibly narrow 
20110127142339.718|20110127142341.548|TR0|one-man doorway. And now we are 
20110127142341.548|20110127142343.378|TR0|physically forcing our way out. 
20110127142343.378|20110127142345.208|TR0|We are physically forcing our 
20110127142345.208|20110127142347.037|TR0|way out. So we've burst out of 
20110127142347.037|20110127142348.867|TR0|the truck, past the police lines.

20110127142419.972|20110127142421.802|TR0|your time Tuesday night when you 
20110127142421.802|20110127142423.631|TR0|were thrown into a van, not 
20110127142423.631|20110127142425.461|TR0|knowing where you would be, with 
20110127142425.461|20110127142427.291|TR0|scores of other people. Describe

20110127142440.099|20110127142441.928|TR0|Well, it was certainly a very 
20110127142441.928|20110127142443.758|TR0|dramatic - dramatic scene. After 
20110127142443.758|20110127142445.588|TR0|we were hauled into the truck, 
20110127142445.588|20110127142447.417|TR0|we were taken right out into the 
20110127142447.417|20110127142449.247|TR0|desert, and there was a lot of 
20110127142449.247|20110127142451.077|TR0|confusion, and everybody was 
20110127142451.077|20110127142452.906|TR0|very disorientated. And as you 
20110127142452.906|20110127142454.736|TR0|heard in the audio report, we 
20110127142454.736|20110127142456.566|TR0|also had a lot of injured 
20110127142456.566|20110127142458.395|TR0|people, people losing blood, and 
20110127142458.395|20110127142500.225|TR0|one man who had passed out into 
20110127142500.225|20110127142502.055|TR0|a diabetic coma. We actually 
20110127142502.055|20110127142503.885|TR0|managed to force our way out of 
20110127142503.885|20110127142505.714|TR0|the truck and escape into the 
20110127142505.714|20110127142507.544|TR0|street in the end. One of the 
20110127142507.544|20110127142509.374|TR0|people with us in the truck was 
20110127142509.374|20110127142511.203|TR0|the son of a very prominent 
20110127142511.203|20110127142513.033|TR0|political dissident here, and 
20110127142513.033|20110127142514.863|TR0|his relatives had shown up, and 
20110127142514.863|20110127142516.692|TR0|they helped secure our release. 
20110127142516.692|20110127142518.522|TR0|After that, we had to make our 
20110127142518.522|20110127142520.352|TR0|way back into the city. The 
20110127142520.352|20110127142522.182|TR0|police had already taken and 
20110127142522.182|20110127142524.011|TR0|have still got our wallets and 
20110127142524.011|20110127142525.841|TR0|mobiles, so we were obviously 
20110127142525.841|20110127142527.671|TR0|quite hampered in terms of being 
20110127142527.671|20110127142529.500|TR0|able to move around. But the 
20110127142529.500|20110127142531.330|TR0|important thing, I think, 
20110127142531.330|20110127142533.160|TR0|although it was a horrifying 
20110127142533.160|20110127142534.989|TR0|experience for me, was that this 
20110127142534.989|20110127142536.819|TR0|is very much not an exception 
20110127142536.819|20110127142538.649|TR0|but a rule when it comes to the 
20110127142538.649|20110127142540.479|TR0|way in which the Mubarak 
20110127142540.479|20110127142542.308|TR0|security apparatus is dealing 
20110127142542.308|20110127142544.138|TR0|with members of this uprising.
20110127142544.138|20110127142545.968|TR0|
20110127142545.968|20110127142547.797|TR0|The kind of scenes we saw on 
20110127142547.797|20110127142549.627|TR0|Tuesday and again yesterday are 
20110127142549.627|20110127142551.457|TR0|really, really unprecedented. 
20110127142551.457|20110127142553.286|TR0|I've covered Cairo for The 
20110127142553.286|20110127142555.116|TR0|Guardian for a few years now, 
20110127142555.116|20110127142556.946|TR0|and I've been on dozens of 
20110127142556.946|20110127142558.776|TR0|protests, where you just see the 
20110127142558.776|20110127142600.605|TR0|same old faces, maybe 100 or 200 
20110127142600.605|20110127142602.435|TR0|people, surrounded by twice as 
20110127142602.435|20110127142604.265|TR0|many riot police. And even 
20110127142604.265|20110127142606.094|TR0|though there's a lot of latent 
20110127142606.094|20110127142607.924|TR0|hostility to the Mubarak regime 
20110127142607.924|20110127142609.754|TR0|among members of the Egyptian 
20110127142609.754|20110127142611.583|TR0|population, many people feel too 
20110127142611.583|20110127142613.413|TR0|intimidated, too scared to come 
20110127142613.413|20110127142615.243|TR0|out and confront the regime 
20110127142615.243|20110127142617.072|TR0|directly. And they also have too 
20110127142617.072|20110127142618.902|TR0|much to lose. You know, people - 
20110127142618.902|20110127142620.732|TR0|unemployment is very high. 
20110127142620.732|20110127142622.562|TR0|Prices are very high. People's 
20110127142622.562|20110127142624.391|TR0|standard of living is - has 
20110127142624.391|20110127142626.221|TR0|taken a real battering. And 
20110127142626.221|20110127142628.051|TR0|people don't want to risk what 
20110127142628.051|20110127142629.880|TR0|they've got for them and their 
20110127142629.880|20110127142631.710|TR0|families by going out and 
20110127142631.710|20110127142633.540|TR0|confronting the regime. That's 
20110127142633.540|20110127142635.369|TR0|really been the status quo for 
20110127142635.369|20110127142637.199|TR0|the past few years. And yet, 
20110127142637.199|20110127142639.029|TR0|what we've seen on Tuesday and 
20110127142639.029|20110127142640.859|TR0|Wednesday is that that fear 
20110127142640.859|20110127142642.688|TR0|barrier seems to have been 
20110127142642.688|20110127142644.518|TR0|broken. I've spoken to so many 
20110127142644.518|20110127142646.348|TR0|people who - including people in 
20110127142646.348|20110127142648.177|TR0|the truck with me the other 
20110127142648.177|20110127142650.007|TR0|night, who are lawyers and bank 
20110127142650.007|20110127142651.837|TR0|analysts and software engineers. 
20110127142651.837|20110127142653.666|TR0|These are sort of middle-class 
20110127142653.666|20110127142655.496|TR0|people who are generally 
20110127142655.496|20110127142657.326|TR0|enjoying quite a comfortable 
20110127142657.326|20110127142659.156|TR0|standard of living; they're not 
20110127142659.156|20110127142700.985|TR0|on the poverty line. They've got 
20110127142700.985|20110127142702.815|TR0|a lot to lose, and yet they're 
20110127142702.815|20110127142704.645|TR0|still being motivated to come 
20110127142704.645|20110127142706.474|TR0|out, to be beaten, to be hit by 
20110127142706.474|20110127142708.304|TR0|water cannons, to be carried off 
20110127142708.304|20110127142710.134|TR0|into the desert. And that's 
20110127142710.134|20110127142711.963|TR0|really a remarkable change from 
20110127142711.963|20110127142713.793|TR0|what we've seen over the past 
20110127142713.793|20110127142715.623|TR0|few years.
20110127142715.623|20110127142717.453|TR0|
20110127142717.453|20110127142719.282|TR0|So I think the next few days are 
20110127142719.282|20110127142721.112|TR0|going to be very interesting. 
20110127142721.112|20110127142722.942|TR0|There are big protests planned 
20110127142722.942|20110127142724.771|TR0|for tomorrow. Today is slightly 
20110127142724.771|20110127142726.601|TR0|a lull in the storm, although 
20110127142726.601|20110127142728.431|TR0|there's a lot of violence still 
20110127142728.431|20110127142730.260|TR0|going on in Suez, which is a big 
20110127142730.260|20110127142732.090|TR0|city to the east of Cairo. In 
20110127142732.090|20110127142733.920|TR0|the capital itself, though, 
20110127142733.920|20110127142735.750|TR0|today has been a bit quieter. 
20110127142735.750|20110127142737.579|TR0|Activists are preparing for 
20110127142737.579|20110127142739.409|TR0|tomorrow. After the afternoon 
20110127142739.409|20110127142741.239|TR0|prayers, there's going to be a 
20110127142741.239|20110127142743.068|TR0|really big surge, and people are 
20110127142743.068|20110127142744.898|TR0|going to try and retake the 
20110127142744.898|20110127142746.728|TR0|streets and reoccupy the central 
20110127142746.728|20110127142748.557|TR0|square, which holds so much 
20110127142748.557|20110127142750.387|TR0|symbolic significance for the 
20110127142750.387|20110127142752.217|TR0|protesters, because they really 
20110127142752.217|20110127142754.046|TR0|- you know, Egyptians haven't 
20110127142754.046|20110127142755.876|TR0|been in control of their own 
20110127142755.876|20110127142757.706|TR0|streets for decades now. The 
20110127142757.706|20110127142759.536|TR0|emergency law prohibits people 
20110127142759.536|20110127142801.365|TR0|organizing and rallying. And the 
20110127142801.365|20110127142803.195|TR0|fact that they took control of 
20110127142803.195|20110127142805.025|TR0|the central square on Tuesday 
20110127142805.025|20110127142806.854|TR0|has really emboldened people, 
20110127142806.854|20110127142808.684|TR0|and people obviously feel 
20110127142808.684|20110127142810.514|TR0|inspired by Tunisia, as well. So 
20110127142810.514|20110127142812.343|TR0|I think the next couple of days 
20110127142812.343|20110127142814.173|TR0|are going to be very, very 
20110127142814.173|20110127142816.003|TR0|interesting.
20110127142816.003|20110127142817.833|TR0|
20110127142817.833|20110127142819.662|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Jack Shenker, 
20110127142819.662|20110127142821.492|TR0|has there been much discussion 
20110127142821.492|20110127142823.322|TR0|of Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel 
20110127142823.322|20110127142825.151|TR0|Peace laureate, the former head 
20110127142825.151|20110127142826.981|TR0|of the International Atomic 
20110127142826.981|20110127142828.811|TR0|Energy Agency, for a while 
20110127142828.811|20110127142830.640|TR0|talked about as a presidential 
20110127142830.640|20110127142832.470|TR0|candidate, returning today from 
20110127142832.470|20110127142834.300|TR0|Vienna to Egypt to join in these 
20110127142834.300|20110127142836.130|TR0|massive protests?
20110127142836.130|20110127142837.959|TR0|
20110127142837.959|20110127142839.789|TR0|>> JACK SHENKER: Yes. Well, 
20110127142839.789|20110127142841.619|TR0|perceptions of ElBaradei are 
20110127142841.619|20110127142843.448|TR0|quite mixed. As you probably 
20110127142843.448|20110127142845.278|TR0|know, when he arrived back in 
20110127142845.278|20110127142847.108|TR0|Egypt after a long absence early 
20110127142847.108|20110127142848.937|TR0|last year in 2010, he brought 
20110127142848.937|20110127142850.767|TR0|with him a huge wave of 
20110127142850.767|20110127142852.597|TR0|optimism. Here was an 
20110127142852.597|20110127142854.427|TR0|establishment figurehead who had 
20110127142854.427|20110127142856.256|TR0|the kind of credibility of being 
20110127142856.256|20110127142858.086|TR0|part of the Egyptian elite, and 
20110127142858.086|20110127142859.916|TR0|yet who was standing up and 
20110127142859.916|20110127142901.745|TR0|having the courage to stand up 
20110127142901.745|20110127142903.575|TR0|and point out all of the 
20110127142903.575|20110127142905.405|TR0|political and social and 
20110127142905.405|20110127142907.234|TR0|economic grievances which have 
20110127142907.234|20110127142909.064|TR0|been ailing Egyptians for so 
20110127142909.064|20110127142910.894|TR0|many decades. And there was a 
20110127142910.894|20110127142912.724|TR0|real feeling that momentum was 
20110127142912.724|20110127142914.553|TR0|going to build behind him and 
20110127142914.553|20110127142916.383|TR0|that he could put a lot of 
20110127142916.383|20110127142918.213|TR0|sustained pressure on the 
20110127142918.213|20110127142920.042|TR0|Mubarak regime.
20110127142920.042|20110127142921.872|TR0|
20110127142921.872|20110127142923.702|TR0|In recent months, that has faded 
20110127142923.702|20110127142925.531|TR0|somewhat. There have been 
20110127142925.531|20110127142927.361|TR0|criticisms, rightly or wrongly, 
20110127142927.361|20110127142929.191|TR0|that ElBaradei has spent too 
20110127142929.191|20110127142931.020|TR0|much time out of the country, he 
20110127142931.020|20110127142932.850|TR0|hasn't spent enough time on the 
20110127142932.850|20110127142934.680|TR0|streets with Egyptian 
20110127142934.680|20110127142936.510|TR0|protesters, where he could offer 
20110127142936.510|20110127142938.339|TR0|them protection through his 
20110127142938.339|20110127142940.169|TR0|fame. And there was a criticism, 
20110127142940.169|20110127142941.999|TR0|as well, because his initial 
20110127142941.999|20110127142943.828|TR0|response to these protests was 
20110127142943.828|20110127142945.658|TR0|quite lukewarm. He said that he 
20110127142945.658|20110127142947.488|TR0|didn't want to see a 
20110127142947.488|20110127142949.317|TR0|Tunisia-style explosion on the 
20110127142949.317|20110127142951.147|TR0|streets of Cairo, and he would 
20110127142951.147|20110127142952.977|TR0|rather use existing avenues, 
20110127142952.977|20110127142954.807|TR0|including a petition, which he's 
20110127142954.807|20110127142956.636|TR0|been - he's collected almost one 
20110127142956.636|20110127142958.466|TR0|million signatures, for 
20110127142958.466|20110127143000.296|TR0|political reform. And obviously 
20110127143000.296|20110127143002.125|TR0|that doesn't feel radical enough 
20110127143002.125|20110127143003.955|TR0|for a lot of the people who have 
20110127143003.955|20110127143005.785|TR0|been brought down to the streets 
20110127143005.785|20110127143007.614|TR0|in recent days.
20110127143007.614|20110127143009.444|TR0|
20110127143009.444|20110127143011.274|TR0|Since the uprising began on 
20110127143011.274|20110127143013.104|TR0|Tuesday, he's become a lot more 
20110127143013.104|20110127143014.933|TR0|vocal. And as you say, he's 
20110127143014.933|20110127143016.763|TR0|flying back from Vienna. And 
20110127143016.763|20110127143018.593|TR0|from the activists I've spoken 
20110127143018.593|20110127143020.422|TR0|to, opinion is split between 
20110127143020.422|20110127143022.252|TR0|those who are angry at him and 
20110127143022.252|20110127143024.082|TR0|think that he's trying to jump 
20110127143024.082|20110127143025.911|TR0|on the bandwagon much too late 
20110127143025.911|20110127143027.741|TR0|and sort of crash the party, as 
20110127143027.741|20110127143029.571|TR0|it were, and - but there's also 
20110127143029.571|20110127143031.401|TR0|those who believe that actually 
20110127143031.401|20110127143033.230|TR0|his presence on the streets, if 
20110127143033.230|20110127143035.060|TR0|indeed he does come down to the 
20110127143035.060|20110127143036.890|TR0|streets, would be incredibly 
20110127143036.890|20110127143038.719|TR0|helpful, because he is a man 
20110127143038.719|20110127143040.549|TR0|with international recognition, 
20110127143040.549|20110127143042.379|TR0|he's feted by Western capitals, 
20110127143042.379|20110127143044.208|TR0|including London and Washington, 
20110127143044.208|20110127143046.038|TR0|and quite simply, if he's 
20110127143046.038|20110127143047.868|TR0|standing in the middle of Tahrir 
20110127143047.868|20110127143049.698|TR0|Square - that's the central 
20110127143049.698|20110127143051.527|TR0|square in Cairo, which was 
20110127143051.527|20110127143053.357|TR0|occupied by demonstrators on 
20110127143053.357|20110127143055.187|TR0|Tuesday - then the police are 
20110127143055.187|20110127143057.016|TR0|going to have to think very, 
20110127143057.016|20110127143058.846|TR0|very hard about firing tear gas, 
20110127143058.846|20110127143100.676|TR0|firing water cannons, and 
20110127143100.676|20110127143102.505|TR0|pelting protesters with rocks, 
20110127143102.505|20110127143104.335|TR0|which is what happened on 
20110127143104.335|20110127143106.165|TR0|Tuesday. So, there's a feeling 
20110127143106.165|20110127143107.994|TR0|that he could offer protesters a 
20110127143107.994|20110127143109.824|TR0|measure of protection, but also 
20110127143109.824|20110127143111.654|TR0|anger that he hasn't been more 
20110127143111.654|20110127143113.484|TR0|involved and more vocal about 
20110127143113.484|20110127143115.313|TR0|what's going on in the last few 
20110127143115.313|20110127143117.143|TR0|days.
20110127143117.143|20110127143118.973|TR0|
20110127143118.973|20110127143120.802|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Jack Shenker, 
20110127143120.802|20110127143122.632|TR0|has the president, has Hosni 
20110127143122.632|20110127143124.462|TR0|Mubarak, issued any statement? 
20110127143124.462|20110127143126.291|TR0|And also, what about the police 
20110127143126.291|20110127143128.121|TR0|crackdown on the streets?
20110127143128.121|20110127143129.951|TR0|
20110127143129.951|20110127143131.781|TR0|>> JACK SHENKER: Well, President 
20110127143131.781|20110127143133.610|TR0|Mubarak has stayed 
20110127143133.610|20110127143135.440|TR0|uncharacteristically silent, and 
20110127143135.440|20110127143137.270|TR0|that's become a real talking 
20110127143137.270|20110127143139.099|TR0|point in the last few days. 
20110127143139.099|20110127143140.929|TR0|There's a feeling that he 
20110127143140.929|20110127143142.759|TR0|doesn't want to bestow any kind 
20110127143142.759|20110127143144.588|TR0|of - any kind of legitimacy or 
20110127143144.588|20110127143146.418|TR0|credibility on the uprisings 
20110127143146.418|20110127143148.248|TR0|going on by stooping to discuss 
20110127143148.248|20110127143150.078|TR0|it. He's trying to sort of stay 
20110127143150.078|20110127143151.907|TR0|above the fray, even though it's 
20110127143151.907|20110127143153.737|TR0|very clear that, not just this 
20110127143153.737|20110127143155.567|TR0|government regime, but him 
20110127143155.567|20110127143157.396|TR0|personally, he is a personal 
20110127143157.396|20110127143159.226|TR0|target of many of the 
20110127143159.226|20110127143201.056|TR0|protesters. And, you know, what 
20110127143201.056|20110127143202.885|TR0|started as a demand for - 
20110127143202.885|20110127143204.715|TR0|specific demands - the 
20110127143204.715|20110127143206.545|TR0|resignation of the interior 
20110127143206.545|20110127143208.375|TR0|minister, an increase in the 
20110127143208.375|20110127143210.204|TR0|minimum wage, political reform - 
20110127143210.204|20110127143212.034|TR0|that has now changed. And I have 
20110127143212.034|20110127143213.864|TR0|spoken to dozens and dozens of 
20110127143213.864|20110127143215.693|TR0|protesters, all of whom say 
20110127143215.693|20110127143217.523|TR0|nothing less than President 
20110127143217.523|20110127143219.353|TR0|Mubarak standing down and 
20110127143219.353|20110127143221.182|TR0|leaving the country will be 
20110127143221.182|20110127143223.012|TR0|acceptable for them.
20110127143223.012|20110127143224.842|TR0|
20110127143224.842|20110127143226.671|TR0|Whilst talking on the phone to 
20110127143226.671|20110127143228.501|TR0|you, actually, I've just been 
20110127143228.501|20110127143230.331|TR0|contacted by the Ministry of 
20110127143230.331|20110127143232.161|TR0|Information here, who say that 
20110127143232.161|20110127143233.990|TR0|the ruling NDP party are about 
20110127143233.990|20110127143235.820|TR0|to have a press conference 
20110127143235.820|20110127143237.650|TR0|around the corner, where Safwat 
20110127143237.650|20110127143239.479|TR0|El-Sherif, who's a senior member 
20110127143239.479|20110127143241.309|TR0|of the ruling party, will be 
20110127143241.309|20110127143243.139|TR0|addressing reporters about the 
20110127143243.139|20110127143244.968|TR0|protests. So, that could be our 
20110127143244.968|20110127143246.798|TR0|first full official statement on 
20110127143246.798|20110127143248.628|TR0|what's happening from the 
20110127143248.628|20110127143250.458|TR0|government. But we still haven't 
20110127143250.458|20110127143252.287|TR0|heard anything from Mubarak 
20110127143252.287|20110127143254.117|TR0|himself.
20110127143254.117|20110127143255.947|TR0|
20110127143255.947|20110127143257.776|TR0|As for the police crackdown on 
20110127143257.776|20110127143259.606|TR0|the streets, the last tally that 
20110127143259.606|20110127143301.436|TR0|I had was that between 800 and 
20110127143301.436|20110127143303.265|TR0|900 protesters have been 
20110127143303.265|20110127143305.095|TR0|arrested. To be honest, it's 
20110127143305.095|20110127143306.925|TR0|likely that the figure is much 
20110127143306.925|20110127143308.755|TR0|higher, because many people, as 
20110127143308.755|20110127143310.584|TR0|we were when we were taken away 
20110127143310.584|20110127143312.414|TR0|- we weren't registered or 
20110127143312.414|20110127143314.244|TR0|processed. We were just beaten 
20110127143314.244|20110127143316.073|TR0|up and herded into a van and 
20110127143316.073|20110127143317.903|TR0|driven off. There was no formal, 
20110127143317.903|20110127143319.733|TR0|you know, registration or 
20110127143319.733|20110127143321.562|TR0|compiling of lists. So the 
20110127143321.562|20110127143323.392|TR0|official figure stands at close 
20110127143323.392|20110127143325.222|TR0|to 900. I'm sure that that will 
20110127143325.222|20110127143327.052|TR0|increase as the day goes on. And 
20110127143327.052|20110127143328.881|TR0|several hundred of those will - 
20110127143328.881|20110127143330.711|TR0|are being taken to a 
20110127143330.711|20110127143332.541|TR0|prosecutor's office in Cairo 
20110127143332.541|20110127143334.370|TR0|today for the first stage of 
20110127143334.370|20110127143336.200|TR0|their interrogations. And 
20110127143336.200|20110127143338.030|TR0|there's a big push by activists 
20110127143338.030|20110127143339.859|TR0|today to get lawyers down to 
20110127143339.859|20110127143341.689|TR0|them to help them through that.
20110127143341.689|20110127143343.519|TR0|
20110127143343.519|20110127143345.349|TR0|But very much, security remains 
20110127143345.349|20110127143347.178|TR0|very high on the streets. There 
20110127143347.178|20110127143349.008|TR0|is an absolutely massive police 
20110127143349.008|20110127143350.838|TR0|presence on pretty much every 
20110127143350.838|20110127143352.667|TR0|street corner in downtown Cairo, 
20110127143352.667|20110127143354.497|TR0|both uniformed riot police and 
20110127143354.497|20110127143356.327|TR0|plain-clothed state security 
20110127143356.327|20110127143358.156|TR0|officers. And small groups of 
20110127143358.156|20110127143359.986|TR0|people, especially young men, 
20110127143359.986|20110127143401.816|TR0|are being targeted. People are 
20110127143401.816|20110127143403.645|TR0|being snatched off the streets. 
20110127143403.645|20110127143405.475|TR0|If it looks like they might be 
20110127143405.475|20110127143407.305|TR0|protesters, if it looks like 
20110127143407.305|20110127143409.135|TR0|they might be political 
20110127143409.135|20110127143410.964|TR0|activists, they are being 
20110127143410.964|20110127143412.794|TR0|targeted by the state security 
20110127143412.794|20110127143414.624|TR0|services to try and avoid 
20110127143414.624|20110127143416.453|TR0|anybody being in groups 
20110127143416.453|20110127143418.283|TR0|coalescing and rallies 
20110127143418.283|20110127143420.113|TR0|spontaneously breaking out. So, 
20110127143420.113|20110127143421.942|TR0|yeah, I imagine things will only 
20110127143421.942|20110127143423.772|TR0|intensify over the night. And 
20110127143423.772|20110127143425.602|TR0|certainly tomorrow afternoon, 
20110127143425.602|20110127143427.432|TR0|we're going to see a very, very 
20110127143427.432|20110127143429.261|TR0|big presence of both protesters 
20110127143429.261|20110127143431.091|TR0|and police on the streets.
20110127143431.091|20110127143432.921|TR0|
20110127143432.921|20110127143434.750|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And finally, 
20110127143434.750|20110127143436.580|TR0|Jack Shenker, where is the 
20110127143436.580|20110127143438.410|TR0|Muslim Brotherhood in all of 
20110127143438.410|20110127143440.239|TR0|this, the largest opposition 
20110127143440.239|20110127143442.069|TR0|group to President Mubarak?
20110127143442.069|20110127143443.899|TR0|
20110127143443.899|20110127143445.729|TR0|>> JACK SHENKER: Well, the 
20110127143445.729|20110127143447.558|TR0|Muslim Brotherhood has had quite 
20110127143447.558|20110127143449.388|TR0|a schizophrenic attitude toward 
20110127143449.388|20110127143451.218|TR0|these protests. They initially 
20110127143451.218|20110127143453.047|TR0|said they weren't going to 
20110127143453.047|20110127143454.877|TR0|participate in them. This was 
20110127143454.877|20110127143456.707|TR0|the previous week before they 
20110127143456.707|20110127143458.536|TR0|started. Their Guidance Council 
20110127143458.536|20110127143500.366|TR0|announced that they would be 
20110127143500.366|20110127143502.196|TR0|having nothing to do with them, 
20110127143502.196|20110127143504.026|TR0|which provoked the anger of some 
20110127143504.026|20110127143505.855|TR0|of their younger members. 
20110127143505.855|20110127143507.685|TR0|There's a real split within the 
20110127143507.685|20110127143509.515|TR0|Muslim Brotherhood between the 
20110127143509.515|20110127143511.344|TR0|older, more conservative members 
20110127143511.344|20110127143513.174|TR0|of the group, who believe that 
20110127143513.174|20110127143515.004|TR0|the Muslim Brotherhood is better 
20110127143515.004|20110127143516.833|TR0|off concentrating on social work 
20110127143516.833|20110127143518.663|TR0|and evangelism and strengthening 
20110127143518.663|20110127143520.493|TR0|the Islamic nature of Egyptian 
20110127143520.493|20110127143522.323|TR0|society and steering clear of 
20110127143522.323|20110127143524.152|TR0|politics, and they are very much 
20110127143524.152|20110127143525.982|TR0|at odds with a much younger 
20110127143525.982|20110127143527.812|TR0|generation of Muslim Brotherhood 
20110127143527.812|20110127143529.641|TR0|activists who want to confront 
20110127143529.641|20110127143531.471|TR0|the regime and who want to form 
20110127143531.471|20110127143533.301|TR0|alliances with liberals and 
20110127143533.301|20110127143535.130|TR0|secular activists and Coptic 
20110127143535.130|20110127143536.960|TR0|Christian groups, as well, to 
20110127143536.960|20110127143538.790|TR0|challenge the regime together. 
20110127143538.790|20110127143540.619|TR0|And after the Guidance Council 
20110127143540.619|20110127143542.449|TR0|said they wouldn't be 
20110127143542.449|20110127143544.279|TR0|participating in the protests, 
20110127143544.279|20110127143546.109|TR0|they then had to issue a U-turn 
20110127143546.109|20110127143547.938|TR0|of sorts, which said that 
20110127143547.938|20110127143549.768|TR0|younger members or all Muslim 
20110127143549.768|20110127143551.598|TR0|Brotherhood member were welcome 
20110127143551.598|20110127143553.427|TR0|to participate in a personal 
20110127143553.427|20110127143555.257|TR0|capacity and that they would be 
20110127143555.257|20110127143557.087|TR0|doing some - they would be 
20110127143557.087|20110127143558.916|TR0|symbolically supporting the 
20110127143558.916|20110127143600.746|TR0|protests.
20110127143600.746|20110127143602.576|TR0|
20110127143602.576|20110127143604.406|TR0|Now that things have really 
20110127143604.406|20110127143606.235|TR0|taken off, and, you know, we've 
20110127143606.235|20110127143608.065|TR0|seen this uprising in the 
20110127143608.065|20110127143609.895|TR0|streets, I think they're 
20110127143609.895|20110127143611.724|TR0|reassessing their strategy. And 
20110127143611.724|20110127143613.554|TR0|they remain - despite the fact 
20110127143613.554|20110127143615.384|TR0|that the Western media often 
20110127143615.384|20110127143617.213|TR0|exaggerates their influence, 
20110127143617.213|20110127143619.043|TR0|they do remain the largest 
20110127143619.043|20110127143620.873|TR0|organized opposition force in 
20110127143620.873|20110127143622.703|TR0|Egypt and certainly the most - 
20110127143622.703|20110127143624.532|TR0|the organization with the most 
20110127143624.532|20110127143626.362|TR0|capability to bring large 
20110127143626.362|20110127143628.192|TR0|numbers of people onto the 
20110127143628.192|20110127143630.021|TR0|street. So, their response in 
20110127143630.021|20110127143631.851|TR0|the next few days is definitely 
20110127143631.851|20110127143633.681|TR0|going to be crucial to all of 
20110127143633.681|20110127143635.510|TR0|this. But to be honest, even if 
20110127143635.510|20110127143637.340|TR0|they don't get involved on a 
20110127143637.340|20110127143639.170|TR0|formal level, I think there's 
20110127143639.170|20110127143641.000|TR0|now so much energy and so much 
20110127143641.000|20110127143642.829|TR0|momentum behind what's going on 
20110127143642.829|20110127143644.659|TR0|that I don't think it will make 
20110127143644.659|20110127143646.489|TR0|much difference. I think that 
20110127143646.489|20110127143648.318|TR0|we'll still see a lot of people 
20110127143648.318|20110127143650.148|TR0|on the streets tomorrow. And 
20110127143650.148|20110127143651.978|TR0|whatever happens over the next 
20110127143651.978|20110127143653.807|TR0|few days and the next few weeks, 
20110127143653.807|20110127143655.637|TR0|I think a really crucial fear 
20110127143655.637|20110127143657.467|TR0|barrier has been crossed in 
20110127143657.467|20110127143659.296|TR0|Egypt, and that's going to have 
20110127143659.296|20110127143701.126|TR0|major consequences further down 
20110127143701.126|20110127143702.956|TR0|the line.

20110127143706.615|20110127143708.445|TR0|want to thank you very much for 
20110127143708.445|20110127143710.275|TR0|joining us from Cairo, and I am

20110127143719.423|20110127143721.253|TR0|joined in our New York studio by 
20110127143721.253|20110127143723.083|TR0|Mostafa Omar, an Egyptian 
20110127143723.083|20110127143724.912|TR0|American activist and writer who 
20110127143724.912|20110127143726.742|TR0|lives in New York City.
20110127143726.742|20110127143728.572|TR0|
20110127143728.572|20110127143730.401|TR0|Mostafa, I wanted to ask you 
20110127143730.401|20110127143732.231|TR0|about the U.S. response. 
20110127143732.231|20110127143734.061|TR0|Clearly, the U.S. weighs in 
20110127143734.061|20110127143735.890|TR0|big-time here, makes an enormous 
20110127143735.890|20110127143737.720|TR0|difference. The second-largest 
20110127143737.720|20110127143739.550|TR0|recipient of U.S. aid, well over 
20110127143739.550|20110127143741.380|TR0|$2 billion the Egyptian 
20110127143741.380|20110127143743.209|TR0|government receives. What about 
20110127143743.209|20110127143745.039|TR0|what Hillary Clinton has said? 
20110127143745.039|20110127143746.869|TR0|Has President Obama weighed in?
20110127143746.869|20110127143748.698|TR0|
20110127143748.698|20110127143750.528|TR0|>> MOSTAFA OMAR: It's really 
20110127143750.528|20110127143752.358|TR0|interesting that Hillary Clinton 
20110127143752.358|20110127143754.187|TR0|said that she supports the 
20110127143754.187|20110127143756.017|TR0|universal rights of the Egyptian 
20110127143756.017|20110127143757.847|TR0|people, after the fact that the 
20110127143757.847|20110127143759.677|TR0|Egyptian people have begun to 
20110127143759.677|20110127143801.506|TR0|exercise those rights. The 
20110127143801.506|20110127143803.336|TR0|Secretary of State had no such 
20110127143803.336|20110127143805.166|TR0|words for the Egyptian regime 
20110127143805.166|20110127143806.995|TR0|over the last number of years.
20110127143806.995|20110127143808.825|TR0|
20110127143808.825|20110127143810.655|TR0|In fact, what she also forgot to 
20110127143810.655|20110127143812.484|TR0|mention is that the tear gas and 
20110127143812.484|20110127143814.314|TR0|the tanks that are driving into 
20110127143814.314|20110127143816.144|TR0|protesters, the concussion 
20110127143816.144|20110127143817.974|TR0|grenades, are all made in the 
20110127143817.974|20110127143819.803|TR0|United States. That is the 
20110127143819.803|20110127143821.633|TR0|meaning of $2 billion in 
20110127143821.633|20110127143823.463|TR0|military aid, military and 
20110127143823.463|20110127143825.292|TR0|economic aid.
20110127143825.292|20110127143827.122|TR0|
20110127143827.122|20110127143828.952|TR0|I think the other point to bring 
20110127143828.952|20110127143830.781|TR0|up is that the State Department, 
20110127143830.781|20110127143832.611|TR0|actually yesterday, mentioned 
20110127143832.611|20110127143834.441|TR0|that they would love to see the 
20110127143834.441|20110127143836.270|TR0|Mubarak regime bring about 
20110127143836.270|20110127143838.100|TR0|reform from above, because 
20110127143838.100|20110127143839.930|TR0|they're absolutely scared of a 
20110127143839.930|20110127143841.760|TR0|Tunisia-style uprising from 
20110127143841.760|20110127143843.589|TR0|below. And that's why I think 
20110127143843.589|20110127143845.419|TR0|they've changed their tone from 
20110127143845.419|20110127143847.249|TR0|"the Egyptian government is 
20110127143847.249|20110127143849.078|TR0|stable" to urging the Egyptian 
20110127143849.078|20110127143850.908|TR0|government to bring about reform 
20110127143850.908|20110127143852.738|TR0|before it's too late, before

20110127143911.035|20110127143912.864|TR0|have developed in the last few 
20110127143912.864|20110127143914.694|TR0|years. They have actually 
20110127143914.694|20110127143916.524|TR0|organized a number of 
20110127143916.524|20110127143918.354|TR0|demonstrations in the last two 
20110127143918.354|20110127143920.183|TR0|years. Most of those 
20110127143920.183|20110127143922.013|TR0|demonstrations were small, 
20110127143922.013|20110127143923.843|TR0|numbered in the hundreds, maybe 
20110127143923.843|20110127143925.672|TR0|500, 600 at most. However, in 
20110127143925.672|20110127143927.502|TR0|the last few weeks, after the 
20110127143927.502|20110127143929.332|TR0|Tunisian explosion, really, the 
20110127143929.332|20110127143931.161|TR0|organizing that has gone on for 
20110127143931.161|20110127143932.991|TR0|the last few years has begun to 
20110127143932.991|20110127143934.821|TR0|pay off, and a lot of young 
20110127143934.821|20110127143936.651|TR0|people, through Facebook and 
20110127143936.651|20110127143938.480|TR0|Twitter, and a lot of young 
20110127143938.480|20110127143940.310|TR0|people who have also been 
20110127143940.310|20110127143942.140|TR0|involved in strikes in the last 
20110127143942.140|20110127143943.969|TR0|few years have actually joined 
20110127143943.969|20110127143945.799|TR0|in this political movement with 
20110127143945.799|20110127143947.629|TR0|the April 6 and a number of 
20110127143947.629|20110127143949.458|TR0|other groups.
20110127143949.458|20110127143951.288|TR0|
20110127143951.288|20110127143953.118|TR0|I've just watched an amazing 
20110127143953.118|20110127143954.948|TR0|call from a young woman, a 
20110127143954.948|20110127143956.777|TR0|veiled young woman, one of the 
20110127143956.777|20110127143958.607|TR0|leaders actually of the movement 
20110127143958.607|20110127144000.437|TR0|in Tahrir Square, downtown 
20110127144000.437|20110127144002.266|TR0|Cairo. It's a six-minute video 
20110127144002.266|20110127144004.096|TR0|on Facebook calling for a 
20110127144004.096|20110127144005.926|TR0|massive national day of action 
20110127144005.926|20110127144007.755|TR0|after the Friday prayers. She 
20110127144007.755|20110127144009.585|TR0|was incredibly eloquent, 
20110127144009.585|20110127144011.415|TR0|passionate. And millions of 
20110127144011.415|20110127144013.244|TR0|people probably will watch that 
20110127144013.244|20110127144015.074|TR0|video. So, the young people - 
20110127144015.074|20110127144016.904|TR0|Egypt is a country of - 60 
20110127144016.904|20110127144018.734|TR0|percent of the population is 
20110127144018.734|20110127144020.563|TR0|under the age of 30, and 90 
20110127144020.563|20110127144022.393|TR0|percent of the unemployment is 
20110127144022.393|20110127144024.223|TR0|also for those young people. And 
20110127144024.223|20110127144026.052|TR0|I think they are playing a 
20110127144026.052|20110127144027.882|TR0|tremendous role, students and 
20110127144027.882|20110127144029.712|TR0|unemployed, along with workers 
20110127144029.712|20110127144031.541|TR0|in this movement.

20110127144046.179|20110127144048.009|TR0|will certainly cover events 
20110127144048.009|20110127144049.838|TR0|tomorrow, what's expected to be 
20110127144049.838|20110127144051.668|TR0|an even more massive 
20110127144051.668|20110127144053.498|TR0|demonstration, from the poorest 
20110127144053.498|20110127144055.328|TR0|in Egypt to the elite, taking to 
20110127144055.328|20110127144057.157|TR0|the streets of Cairo, 
20110127144057.157|20110127144058.987|TR0|Alexandria, Suez, all over 
20110127144058.987|20110127144100.817|TR0|Egypt, taking on the

20110127144111.795|20110127144113.625|TR0|broadcasting from Park City, 
20110127144113.625|20110127144115.454|TR0|Utah, from the Sundance Film 
20110127144115.454|20110127144117.284|TR0|Festival. I'm Amy Goodman, as we 
20110127144117.284|20110127144119.114|TR0|turn to the issue of guns. 
20110127144119.114|20110127144120.943|TR0|President Obama made no mention 
20110127144120.943|20110127144122.773|TR0|of the hot-button topic of gun 
20110127144122.773|20110127144124.603|TR0|control during his hour-long 
20110127144124.603|20110127144126.432|TR0|State of the Union address on 
20110127144126.432|20110127144128.262|TR0|Tuesday, even as he paid tribute

20110127144131.921|20110127144133.751|TR0|House advisers say the omission 
20110127144133.751|20110127144135.581|TR0|of gun control was intentional. 
20110127144135.581|20110127144137.411|TR0|They say he'll soon unveil new 
20110127144137.411|20110127144139.240|TR0|gun control efforts that aim to 
20110127144139.240|20110127144141.070|TR0|strengthen current laws. Some of 
20110127144141.070|20110127144142.900|TR0|those laws allow mentally 
20110127144142.900|20110127144144.729|TR0|unstable people, such as Jared 
20110127144144.729|20110127144146.559|TR0|Loughner, the alleged Arizona 
20110127144146.559|20110127144148.389|TR0|gunman, to purchase assault 
20110127144148.389|20110127144150.218|TR0|weapons without a background

20110127144153.878|20110127144155.708|TR0|Well, a new documentary here at

20110127144157.537|20110127144159.367|TR0|features a young activist who is 
20110127144159.367|20110127144201.197|TR0|already tackling the topic of 
20110127144201.197|20110127144203.026|TR0|gun control. It's called Living 
20110127144203.026|20110127144204.856|TR0|for 32. It features the story of 
20110127144204.856|20110127144206.686|TR0|Colin Goddard. He's a survivor 
20110127144206.686|20110127144208.515|TR0|of the shooting in 2007 on the 
20110127144208.515|20110127144210.345|TR0|Virginia Tech campus that left 
20110127144210.345|20110127144212.175|TR0|32 people dead. Here's an 
20110127144212.175|20110127144214.005|TR0|excerpt from the film.
20110127144214.005|20110127144215.834|TR0|
20110127144215.834|20110127144217.664|TR0|>> COLIN GODDARD: The teacher 
20110127144217.664|20110127144219.494|TR0|went to the door to look into 
20110127144219.494|20110127144221.323|TR0|the hallway to see what was 
20110127144221.323|20110127144223.153|TR0|going on and making all that 
20110127144223.153|20110127144224.983|TR0|noise. And as soon as she opened 
20110127144224.983|20110127144226.812|TR0|it, she shut it back again and 
20110127144226.812|20110127144228.642|TR0|said, "Everyone, get underneath 
20110127144228.642|20110127144230.472|TR0|your desks, and somebody call 
20110127144230.472|20110127144232.302|TR0|911." I pulled out my phone and 
20110127144232.302|20110127144234.131|TR0|dialed 911. And I said that 
20110127144234.131|20110127144235.961|TR0|"We're in Norris Hall. I think 
20110127144235.961|20110127144237.791|TR0|there's a shooting going on." 
20110127144237.791|20110127144239.620|TR0|And as soon as I basically got 
20110127144239.620|20110127144241.450|TR0|that out, we saw bullets coming 
20110127144241.450|20110127144243.280|TR0|through our door. Everyone 
20110127144243.280|20110127144245.109|TR0|jumped underneath their desks 
20110127144245.109|20110127144246.939|TR0|and went to the floor.
20110127144246.939|20110127144248.769|TR0|
20110127144248.769|20110127144250.599|TR0|>> REPORTER: You're seeing 
20110127144250.599|20110127144252.428|TR0|police out with their weapons 
20110127144252.428|20110127144254.258|TR0|drawn; students out, looking, 
20110127144254.258|20110127144256.088|TR0|trying to see what's going on, 
20110127144256.088|20110127144257.917|TR0|running out of buildings.
20110127144257.917|20110127144259.747|TR0|
20110127144259.747|20110127144301.577|TR0|>> COLIN GODDARD: All the major 
20110127144301.577|20110127144303.406|TR0|doors to our building were 
20110127144303.406|20110127144305.236|TR0|chained shut from the inside, 
20110127144305.236|20110127144307.066|TR0|and they had a sign on them, 
20110127144307.066|20110127144308.895|TR0|says, "If you open this door, it 
20110127144308.895|20110127144310.725|TR0|will explode."
20110127144310.725|20110127144312.555|TR0|
20110127144312.555|20110127144314.385|TR0|I came full circle with the 
20110127144314.385|20110127144316.214|TR0|situation when I was shot the 
20110127144316.214|20110127144318.044|TR0|first time in my left knee. Sure 
20110127144318.044|20110127144319.874|TR0|enough, you feel that sensation 
20110127144319.874|20110127144321.703|TR0|of a huge push and a sharp 
20110127144321.703|20110127144323.533|TR0|sting, and you feel the blood 
20110127144323.533|20110127144325.363|TR0|kind of trickle down your leg 
20110127144325.363|20110127144327.192|TR0|and you feel it kind of warm on 
20110127144327.192|20110127144329.022|TR0|your body.
20110127144329.022|20110127144330.852|TR0|
20110127144330.852|20110127144332.682|TR0|And then the bangs just got much 
20110127144332.682|20110127144334.511|TR0|louder again. You could tell he 
20110127144334.511|20110127144336.341|TR0|was back in our room. This time 
20110127144336.341|20110127144338.171|TR0|he more methodically came down 
20110127144338.171|20110127144340.000|TR0|each of the rows and was still 
20110127144340.000|20110127144341.830|TR0|firing. At one point he was 
20110127144341.830|20110127144343.660|TR0|standing at my feet. And that's 
20110127144343.660|20110127144345.489|TR0|when I was shot a second time in 
20110127144345.489|20110127144347.319|TR0|my left hip.
20110127144347.319|20110127144349.149|TR0|
20110127144349.149|20110127144350.979|TR0|>> EYEWITNESS: Some gunshots.

20110127144354.638|20110127144356.468|TR0|>> COLIN GODDARD: And he shot me 
20110127144356.468|20110127144358.297|TR0|a third time in my right 
20110127144358.297|20110127144400.127|TR0|shoulder. And then it flipped my 
20110127144400.127|20110127144401.957|TR0|whole body around, and that 
20110127144401.957|20110127144403.786|TR0|exposed my right side, and I was 
20110127144403.786|20110127144405.616|TR0|shot for a fourth time in my 
20110127144405.616|20110127144407.446|TR0|right hip. It seems that I only 
20110127144407.446|20110127144409.276|TR0|remember a couple more gunshots 
20110127144409.276|20110127144411.105|TR0|after that, and then everything 
20110127144411.105|20110127144412.935|TR0|got quiet. Just as it all 
20110127144412.935|20110127144414.765|TR0|started, it all just stopped.
20110127144414.765|20110127144416.594|TR0|
20110127144416.594|20110127144418.424|TR0|It just felt like an eternity 
20110127144418.424|20110127144420.254|TR0|before the police got to our 
20110127144420.254|20110127144422.083|TR0|door and tried to open it up and 
20110127144422.083|20110127144423.913|TR0|couldn't open the door. They had 
20110127144423.913|20110127144425.743|TR0|to ask for help from the inside 
20110127144425.743|20110127144427.573|TR0|to help them open the door, 
20110127144427.573|20110127144429.402|TR0|because there were bodies in the 
20110127144429.402|20110127144431.232|TR0|way. And as soon as the police 
20110127144431.232|20110127144433.062|TR0|came into the room, they said, 
20110127144433.062|20110127144434.891|TR0|"Shooter down." And that's when 
20110127144434.891|20110127144436.721|TR0|I was like, "Shooter down? 
20110127144436.721|20110127144438.551|TR0|What?" I didn't know that he had 
20110127144438.551|20110127144440.380|TR0|committed suicide in the front 
20110127144440.380|20110127144442.210|TR0|of our classroom.
20110127144442.210|20110127144444.040|TR0|
20110127144444.040|20110127144445.869|TR0|Soon after that, the police and 
20110127144445.869|20110127144447.699|TR0|the medic staff came in and 
20110127144447.699|20110127144449.529|TR0|began their triage of all the 
20110127144449.529|20110127144451.359|TR0|students lying on the floor. And 
20110127144451.359|20110127144453.188|TR0|I remember hearing them walk up 
20110127144453.188|20110127144455.018|TR0|to people, say, "This person is 
20110127144455.018|20110127144456.848|TR0|yellow. This person is red." And 
20110127144456.848|20110127144458.677|TR0|then I heard, "Black tag, black 
20110127144458.677|20110127144500.507|TR0|tag, black tag." And that's when 
20110127144500.507|20110127144502.337|TR0|I realized that there were other 
20110127144502.337|20110127144504.166|TR0|students in here who didn't make 
20110127144504.166|20110127144505.996|TR0|it.
20110127144505.996|20110127144507.826|TR0|
20110127144507.826|20110127144509.656|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was an 
20110127144509.656|20110127144511.485|TR0|excerpt from the new documentary 
20110127144511.485|20110127144513.315|TR0|called Living for 32. It 
20110127144513.315|20110127144515.145|TR0|features the story of Colin 
20110127144515.145|20110127144516.974|TR0|Goddard, a student who was shot 
20110127144516.974|20110127144518.804|TR0|during the Virginia Tech 
20110127144518.804|20110127144520.634|TR0|massacre. Colin joins us here in 
20110127144520.634|20110127144522.463|TR0|Park City, Utah, where the film 
20110127144522.463|20110127144524.293|TR0|is premiering.

20110127144529.782|20110127144531.612|TR0|>> COLIN GODDARD: Thank you. 
20110127144531.612|20110127144533.442|TR0|It's a pleasure to be here.

20110127144537.101|20110127144538.931|TR0|with you. Just meeting you, and 
20110127144538.931|20110127144540.760|TR0|you said this - Democracy Now! 
20110127144540.760|20110127144542.590|TR0|was assigned viewing in your 
20110127144542.590|20110127144544.420|TR0|class in Virginia Tech?
20110127144544.420|20110127144546.250|TR0|
20110127144546.250|20110127144548.079|TR0|>> COLIN GODDARD: Yeah. 
20110127144548.079|20110127144549.909|TR0|Actually, after the shooting, I 
20110127144549.909|20110127144551.739|TR0|took a class that was not even 
20110127144551.739|20110127144553.568|TR0|required for my major, but it 
20110127144553.568|20110127144555.398|TR0|was an interesting topic, and 
20110127144555.398|20110127144557.228|TR0|the teacher was amazing. And he, 
20110127144557.228|20110127144559.057|TR0|you know, showed me the program, 
20110127144559.057|20110127144600.887|TR0|and I've been watching it ever 
20110127144600.887|20110127144602.717|TR0|since.
20110127144602.717|20110127144604.547|TR0|
20110127144604.547|20110127144606.376|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, what 
20110127144606.376|20110127144608.206|TR0|happened on that fateful day 
20110127144608.206|20110127144610.036|TR0|that you've just described, on 
20110127144610.036|20110127144611.865|TR0|April 16, 2007? You were shot 
20110127144611.865|20110127144613.695|TR0|four times? The Tucson massacre 
20110127144613.695|20110127144615.525|TR0|takes place. What kind of 
20110127144615.525|20110127144617.354|TR0|reaction did you have when you 
20110127144617.354|20110127144619.184|TR0|heard that?
20110127144619.184|20110127144621.014|TR0|
20110127144621.014|20110127144622.843|TR0|>> COLIN GODDARD: I was actually 
20110127144622.843|20110127144624.673|TR0|stepping out of my apartment to 
20110127144624.673|20110127144626.503|TR0|go have brunch with some 
20110127144626.503|20110127144628.333|TR0|friends, and the director of the 
20110127144628.333|20110127144630.162|TR0|film called me up and told me, 
20110127144630.162|20110127144631.992|TR0|you know, "You've got to check 
20110127144631.992|20110127144633.822|TR0|the news. There's been a 
20110127144633.822|20110127144635.651|TR0|congresswoman shot. It's going 
20110127144635.651|20110127144637.481|TR0|to be all over. You've got to 
20110127144637.481|20110127144639.311|TR0|start talking about it." And I 
20110127144639.311|20110127144641.140|TR0|was like, Ah, you know - you 
20110127144641.140|20110127144642.970|TR0|know, from all this progress and 
20110127144642.970|20110127144644.800|TR0|all the hard work that we're 
20110127144644.800|20110127144646.630|TR0|trying to do, when you hear 
20110127144646.630|20110127144648.459|TR0|about another family is going 
20110127144648.459|20110127144650.289|TR0|through the same thing that I 
20110127144650.289|20110127144652.119|TR0|had went through, my whole 
20110127144652.119|20110127144653.948|TR0|family went through, and so many 
20110127144653.948|20110127144655.778|TR0|other families did, it just 
20110127144655.778|20110127144657.608|TR0|brings you right back to it. And 
20110127144657.608|20110127144659.437|TR0|it's like, you know, can we do 
20110127144659.437|20110127144701.267|TR0|nothing? Can we not do something 
20110127144701.267|20110127144703.097|TR0|to make this less likely to 
20110127144703.097|20110127144704.927|TR0|happen to other people? You 
20110127144704.927|20110127144706.756|TR0|know, it's tough. But, you know.
20110127144706.756|20110127144708.586|TR0|
20110127144708.586|20110127144710.416|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Your mom, in the 
20110127144710.416|20110127144712.245|TR0|film, Living for 32, says she 
20110127144712.245|20110127144714.075|TR0|does not want this to be the 
20110127144714.075|20110127144715.905|TR0|defining moment of your life, 
20110127144715.905|20110127144717.734|TR0|being shot, this horrendous 
20110127144717.734|20110127144719.564|TR0|massacre that took place. And 
20110127144719.564|20110127144721.394|TR0|yet it has become the defining

20110127144730.542|20110127144732.372|TR0|Andrew and little sister Emma. I 
20110127144732.372|20110127144734.202|TR0|know it's a hard morning, 
20110127144734.202|20110127144736.031|TR0|especially today for you, Colin, 
20110127144736.031|20110127144737.861|TR0|because I'm understanding that 
20110127144737.861|20110127144739.691|TR0|you're in some pain, so thank 
20110127144739.691|20110127144741.520|TR0|you for joining us to talk to 
20110127144741.520|20110127144743.350|TR0|us. I understand that you were 
20110127144743.350|20110127144745.180|TR0|hit three times - in the 
20110127144745.180|20110127144747.010|TR0|shoulder, in the buttocks and 
20110127144747.010|20110127144748.839|TR0|also in the leg - and that they 
20110127144748.839|20110127144750.669|TR0|put a steel rod to help you 
20110127144750.669|20110127144752.499|TR0|stand and walk, and that you 
20110127144752.499|20110127144754.328|TR0|actually stood on your own 
20110127144754.328|20110127144756.158|TR0|yesterday, and you want to run 
20110127144756.158|20110127144757.988|TR0|soon. Is that what I'm hearing?

20110127144805.307|20110127144807.136|TR0|that I can, so, you know, 
20110127144807.136|20110127144808.966|TR0|whatever I've got to do to do 
20110127144808.966|20110127144810.796|TR0|that, I'll do it.

20110127144821.774|20110127144823.604|TR0|I think, would be to just return 
20110127144823.604|20110127144825.433|TR0|to the community, return to my 
20110127144825.433|20110127144827.263|TR0|friends, return to my daily 
20110127144827.263|20110127144829.093|TR0|routine, and try to just grind 
20110127144829.093|20110127144830.922|TR0|it out through then, and then 
20110127144830.922|20110127144832.752|TR0|try to get it as much back to 
20110127144832.752|20110127144834.582|TR0|normal as I can.

20110127144840.071|20110127144841.901|TR0|cadet running around there with 
20110127144841.901|20110127144843.730|TR0|my uniform, getting yelled at by

20110127144847.390|20110127144849.219|TR0|I was one of seven students to 
20110127144849.219|20110127144851.049|TR0|survive out of a class of 17. My 
20110127144851.049|20110127144852.879|TR0|teacher was killed, and there 
20110127144852.879|20110127144854.708|TR0|were some students in my class 
20110127144854.708|20110127144856.538|TR0|who weren't there that day. I 
20110127144856.538|20110127144858.368|TR0|don't know why. I know that 
20110127144858.368|20110127144900.198|TR0|there were people who were 
20110127144900.198|20110127144902.027|TR0|killed all around me that did 
20110127144902.027|20110127144903.857|TR0|nothing different than I did, 
20110127144903.857|20110127144905.687|TR0|and I just got lucky. People 
20110127144905.687|20110127144907.516|TR0|tell me that God was looking out 
20110127144907.516|20110127144909.346|TR0|for me that day, that's why I'm 
20110127144909.346|20110127144911.176|TR0|here. I don't know how much of 
20110127144911.176|20110127144913.005|TR0|that I can take in. I mean, like 
20110127144913.005|20110127144914.835|TR0|I said, I did nothing different 
20110127144914.835|20110127144916.665|TR0|than people lying next to me. 
20110127144916.665|20110127144918.494|TR0|You know, God was looking out 
20110127144918.494|20110127144920.324|TR0|for them, too, I'm sure.

20110127144922.154|20110127144923.984|TR0|People were very surprised that 
20110127144923.984|20110127144925.813|TR0|I came back to this school, but 
20110127144925.813|20110127144927.643|TR0|in my mind there was no other 
20110127144927.643|20110127144929.473|TR0|choice. I had to finish it out 
20110127144929.473|20110127144931.302|TR0|here. This will always be a

20110127144940.451|20110127144942.281|TR0|were surprised you went back to

20110127144956.918|20110127144958.748|TR0|>> COLIN GODDARD: Well, I mean, 
20110127144958.748|20110127145000.578|TR0|you know, it took me about two 
20110127145000.578|20110127145002.407|TR0|years for me to get to the point 
20110127145002.407|20110127145004.237|TR0|where I could share my story and 
20110127145004.237|20110127145006.067|TR0|be involved in the gun violence 
20110127145006.067|20110127145007.896|TR0|prevention Movement. You know, 
20110127145007.896|20110127145009.726|TR0|any time something crazy like 
20110127145009.726|20110127145011.556|TR0|this happens to you, no matter 
20110127145011.556|20110127145013.385|TR0|what it is, you try to figure 
20110127145013.385|20110127145015.215|TR0|out why and how. And while we 
20110127145015.215|20110127145017.045|TR0|tried to find those answers, we 
20110127145017.045|20110127145018.875|TR0|learned about, you know, the 
20110127145018.875|20110127145020.704|TR0|loopholes in the laws that do 
20110127145020.704|20110127145022.534|TR0|and don't exist with firearms, 
20110127145022.534|20110127145024.364|TR0|as well as mental health and 
20110127145024.364|20110127145026.193|TR0|school policies. And I felt like 
20110127145026.193|20110127145028.023|TR0|there was progress in those 
20110127145028.023|20110127145029.853|TR0|other two areas, but not so much 
20110127145029.853|20110127145031.682|TR0|in firearms. That seems to - you 
20110127145031.682|20110127145033.512|TR0|know, any sort of legislation on 
20110127145033.512|20110127145035.342|TR0|Capitol Hill seems to be dead on 
20110127145035.342|20110127145037.172|TR0|arrival, which is - you know, I 
20110127145037.172|20110127145039.001|TR0|don't understand why. So, my 
20110127145039.001|20110127145040.831|TR0|quest is to understand kind of 
20110127145040.831|20110127145042.661|TR0|why things are the way they are 
20110127145042.661|20110127145044.490|TR0|on Capitol Hill.

20110127145048.150|20110127145049.979|TR0|about the gun show loophole?
20110127145049.979|20110127145051.809|TR0|
20110127145051.809|20110127145053.639|TR0|>> COLIN GODDARD: Right. The gun 
20110127145053.639|20110127145055.468|TR0|show loophole allows private 
20110127145055.468|20110127145057.298|TR0|sellers who frequent these gun 
20110127145057.298|20110127145059.128|TR0|shows on weekends to sell guns 
20110127145059.128|20110127145100.958|TR0|to the population, the general 
20110127145100.958|20110127145102.787|TR0|population of attendees who 
20110127145102.787|20110127145104.617|TR0|attend, without requiring 
20110127145104.617|20110127145106.447|TR0|background checks on anyone who 
20110127145106.447|20110127145108.276|TR0|buys from them. Legally, by law, 
20110127145108.276|20110127145110.106|TR0|they're required to know the age 
20110127145110.106|20110127145111.936|TR0|of the purchaser, as well as the 
20110127145111.936|20110127145113.765|TR0|state of residency, which is 
20110127145113.765|20110127145115.595|TR0|important, but not the ultimate 
20110127145115.595|20110127145117.425|TR0|information they'd like to know, 
20110127145117.425|20110127145119.255|TR0|which is, you know, any sort of 
20110127145119.255|20110127145121.084|TR0|felony records or history of 
20110127145121.084|20110127145122.914|TR0|mental illness, domestic

20110127145124.744|20110127145126.573|TR0|you can literally go to these 
20110127145126.573|20110127145128.403|TR0|gun shows and purchase the same 
20110127145128.403|20110127145130.233|TR0|weapons at the same place, two

20110127145442.351|20110127145444.181|TR0|instead of telling people to go

20110127145644.941|20110127145646.770|TR0|Utah, despite protests from

20110127145648.600|20110127145650.430|TR0|inappropriate because of the

20110127145701.408|20110127145703.238|TR0|being pushed is because it's a 
20110127145703.238|20110127145705.067|TR0|Browning gun, and the Browning 
20110127145705.067|20110127145706.897|TR0|family was from Ogden, Utah. So
