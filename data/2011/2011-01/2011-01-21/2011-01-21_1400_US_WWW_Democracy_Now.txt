20110121140036.231|20110121140038.034|TR0|she was critically wounded in 
20110121140038.034|20110121140039.838|TR0|the Tucson shooting rampage. On 
20110121140039.838|20110121140041.641|TR0|Thursday, the chief of neurology 
20110121140041.641|20110121140043.445|TR0|at University Medical Center, 
20110121140043.445|20110121140045.248|TR0|Dr. Michael Lemole, discussed 
20110121140045.248|20110121140047.052|TR0|Giffords' progress.

20110121140048.855|20110121140050.659|TR0|Dr. Michael Lemole: "Well, we 
20110121140050.659|20110121140052.462|TR0|can tell very simple things. I 
20110121140052.462|20110121140054.266|TR0|think you've already heard 
20110121140054.266|20110121140056.069|TR0|reports she'll scroll through 
20110121140056.069|20110121140057.873|TR0|her iPad and look at pictures. 
20110121140057.873|20110121140059.676|TR0|She'll pick out different 
20110121140059.676|20110121140101.480|TR0|stuffed animals. She'll interact 
20110121140101.480|20110121140103.283|TR0|with Mark in ways that were 
20110121140103.283|20110121140105.087|TR0|personal and intimate, even 
20110121140105.087|20110121140106.890|TR0|preceding this. So I think 
20110121140106.890|20110121140108.693|TR0|that's the best way we can tell. 
20110121140108.693|20110121140110.497|TR0|There is no quantifiable way we 
20110121140110.497|20110121140112.300|TR0|can say that she's registered 
20110121140112.300|20110121140114.104|TR0|the message as to what's 
20110121140114.104|20110121140115.907|TR0|happened to her, but we do think 
20110121140115.907|20110121140117.711|TR0|that a lot of that is getting 
20110121140117.711|20110121140119.514|TR0|through."

20110121140123.121|20110121140124.925|TR0|Giffords was brought outside to 
20110121140124.925|20110121140126.728|TR0|a hospital deck for a moment of 
20110121140126.728|20110121140128.532|TR0|fresh air. Ahead of the transfer 
20110121140128.532|20110121140130.335|TR0|to Houston, Giffords' husband,

20110121140133.942|20110121140135.746|TR0|
20110121140135.746|20110121140137.549|TR0|Mark Kelly: "So, I'm extremely 
20110121140137.549|20110121140139.353|TR0|hopeful that Gabby is going to 
20110121140139.353|20110121140141.156|TR0|make a full recovery. I've told 
20110121140141.156|20110121140142.960|TR0|her that. She recognizes it. 
20110121140142.960|20110121140144.763|TR0|She's a strong person, a 
20110121140144.763|20110121140146.567|TR0|fighter. I mean, she is a 
20110121140146.567|20110121140148.370|TR0|fighter like, you know, nobody 
20110121140148.370|20110121140150.174|TR0|else that I know, so I am 
20110121140150.174|20110121140151.977|TR0|extremely confident that she's 
20110121140151.977|20110121140153.780|TR0|going to be back here and back 
20110121140153.780|20110121140155.584|TR0|at work soon. I've been telling 
20110121140155.584|20110121140157.387|TR0|the hospital staff that they 
20110121140157.387|20110121140159.191|TR0|should expect to see her walking 
20110121140159.191|20110121140200.994|TR0|through these halls and into the 
20110121140200.994|20110121140202.798|TR0|ICU within a couple months. I'm 
20110121140202.798|20110121140204.601|TR0|sure of that. So she'll be back."

20110121140231.654|20110121140233.457|TR0|programs. According to the

20110121140235.261|20110121140237.064|TR0|demand would entail reducing 
20110121140237.064|20110121140238.867|TR0|funding for most federal 
20110121140238.867|20110121140240.671|TR0|agencies by one-third over the

20110121141454.687|20110121141456.491|TR0|is hypocritical for Obama to 
20110121141456.491|20110121141458.294|TR0|support abortion because he is

20110121141505.508|20110121141507.312|TR0|didn't want to answer - is that: 
20110121141507.312|20110121141509.115|TR0|is that human life a person

20110121141514.526|20110121141516.329|TR0|a person, then I find it almost 
20110121141516.329|20110121141518.133|TR0|remarkable for a black man to

20110121141858.157|20110121141859.961|TR0|went a very different route. You

20110121141921.602|20110121141923.406|TR0|differently than the Republicans 
20110121141923.406|20110121141925.209|TR0|in Congress. I was elected 
20110121141925.209|20110121141927.013|TR0|governor to create jobs and to 
20110121141927.013|20110121141928.816|TR0|ensure that Vermonters have a 
20110121141928.816|20110121141930.620|TR0|better and more hopeful economic 
20110121141930.620|20110121141932.423|TR0|future. The biggest challenge 
20110121141932.423|20110121141934.227|TR0|for business in Vermont, or one 
20110121141934.227|20110121141936.030|TR0|of them, is the rising cost of 
20110121141936.030|20110121141937.834|TR0|healthcare. And I think what we 
20110121141937.834|20110121141939.637|TR0|want to do here in Vermont is to 
20110121141939.637|20110121141941.441|TR0|create a single pool, much like 
20110121141941.441|20110121141943.244|TR0|General Motors, Ford, Oracle, 
20110121141943.244|20110121141945.048|TR0|ensure that healthcare is a 
20110121141945.048|20110121141946.851|TR0|right and not a privilege, and 
20110121141946.851|20110121141948.655|TR0|use technology and other methods 
20110121141948.655|20110121141950.458|TR0|to contain cost. We want to have 
20110121141950.458|20110121141952.262|TR0|universal access. We want to be 
20110121141952.262|20110121141954.065|TR0|the first state where health 
20110121141954.065|20110121141955.868|TR0|insurance follows the individual 
20110121141955.868|20110121141957.672|TR0|and is not a requirement of the 
20110121141957.672|20110121141959.475|TR0|employer - I think that will be 
20110121141959.475|20110121142001.279|TR0|a huge jobs creator. And most 
20110121142001.279|20110121142003.082|TR0|importantly, we have to contain 
20110121142003.082|20110121142004.886|TR0|cost.
20110121142004.886|20110121142006.689|TR0|
20110121142006.689|20110121142008.493|TR0|Here's our challenge. Our 
20110121142008.493|20110121142010.296|TR0|premiums go up 10, 15, 20 
20110121142010.296|20110121142012.100|TR0|percent a year. This is true in 
20110121142012.100|20110121142013.903|TR0|the rest of the country, as 
20110121142013.903|20110121142015.707|TR0|well. They are killing small 
20110121142015.707|20110121142017.510|TR0|business. They're killing 
20110121142017.510|20110121142019.314|TR0|middle-class Americans, who have 
20110121142019.314|20110121142021.117|TR0|been kicked in the teeth over 
20110121142021.117|20110121142022.921|TR0|the last several years. What our 
20110121142022.921|20110121142024.724|TR0|plan will do is create a single 
20110121142024.724|20110121142026.528|TR0|pool, get the insurance company 
20110121142026.528|20110121142028.331|TR0|profits, the pharmaceutical 
20110121142028.331|20110121142030.135|TR0|company profits, the other folks 
20110121142030.135|20110121142031.938|TR0|that are mining the system to 
20110121142031.938|20110121142033.742|TR0|make a lot of money on the backs 
20110121142033.742|20110121142035.545|TR0|of our illnesses, and ensure 
20110121142035.545|20110121142037.349|TR0|that we're using those dollars 
20110121142037.349|20110121142039.152|TR0|to make Vermonters healthy. So, 
20110121142039.152|20110121142040.955|TR0|a single pool that uses 
20110121142040.955|20110121142042.759|TR0|technology to ensure that we get 
20110121142042.759|20110121142044.562|TR0|rid of the waste and dedicate 
20110121142044.562|20110121142046.366|TR0|those dollars to making 
20110121142046.366|20110121142048.169|TR0|Vermonters healthy.
20110121142048.169|20110121142049.973|TR0|
20110121142049.973|20110121142051.776|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And how would 
20110121142051.776|20110121142053.580|TR0|the options that you are looking 
20110121142053.580|20110121142055.383|TR0|at differ on the issue that the 
20110121142055.383|20110121142057.187|TR0|Republicans have centered in on, 
20110121142057.187|20110121142058.990|TR0|the issue of individual 
20110121142058.990|20110121142100.794|TR0|mandates, that people must carry 
20110121142100.794|20110121142102.597|TR0|insurance?
20110121142102.597|20110121142104.401|TR0|
20110121142104.401|20110121142106.204|TR0|>> GOV. PETER SHUMLIN: Well, you 
20110121142106.204|20110121142108.008|TR0|know, the individual mandate is 
20110121142108.008|20110121142109.811|TR0|going to be important to any 
20110121142109.811|20110121142111.615|TR0|success of healthcare. I mean, 
20110121142111.615|20110121142113.418|TR0|let's look what we're doing in 
20110121142113.418|20110121142115.222|TR0|this country, that every other 
20110121142115.222|20110121142117.025|TR0|single country in the world 
20110121142117.025|20110121142118.829|TR0|seems to have figured out. You 
20110121142118.829|20110121142120.632|TR0|cannot just have a system that 
20110121142120.632|20110121142122.436|TR0|is designed to reward providers 
20110121142122.436|20110121142124.239|TR0|and others for waste and 
20110121142124.239|20110121142126.042|TR0|inefficiency. You can't have a 
20110121142126.042|20110121142127.846|TR0|system that is designed, 
20110121142127.846|20110121142129.649|TR0|frankly, to reward financially 
20110121142129.649|20110121142131.453|TR0|those that do the most to you 
20110121142131.453|20110121142133.256|TR0|and not necessarily keep you the 
20110121142133.256|20110121142135.060|TR0|healthiest.
20110121142135.060|20110121142136.863|TR0|
20110121142136.863|20110121142138.667|TR0|So there are three things that 
20110121142138.667|20110121142140.470|TR0|we want our system to do. The 
20110121142140.470|20110121142142.274|TR0|first is, we're wasting eight to 
20110121142142.274|20110121142144.077|TR0|10 cents on the dollar in 
20110121142144.077|20110121142145.881|TR0|Vermont - frankly, in the rest 
20110121142145.881|20110121142147.684|TR0|of the country - chasing money 
20110121142147.684|20110121142149.488|TR0|around. No sane person would do 
20110121142149.488|20110121142151.291|TR0|that. We all know what we do. If 
20110121142151.291|20110121142153.095|TR0|we have insurance, we get the 
20110121142153.095|20110121142154.898|TR0|bill from our provider. Then the 
20110121142154.898|20110121142156.702|TR0|next envelope comes from the 
20110121142156.702|20110121142158.505|TR0|insurer. You wait for four or 
20110121142158.505|20110121142200.309|TR0|five of them to build up before 
20110121142200.309|20110121142202.112|TR0|you figure out what share you're 
20110121142202.112|20110121142203.916|TR0|going to pay as an insured 
20110121142203.916|20110121142205.719|TR0|family and what share they're 
20110121142205.719|20110121142207.523|TR0|going to pay. That is 
20110121142207.523|20110121142209.326|TR0|extraordinarily inefficient. We 
20110121142209.326|20110121142211.129|TR0|want to be the first state in 
20110121142211.129|20110121142212.933|TR0|the country that has the Green 
20110121142212.933|20110121142214.736|TR0|Mountain healthcare card. When 
20110121142214.736|20110121142216.540|TR0|you come out of your provider's 
20110121142216.540|20110121142218.343|TR0|office, you pay your co-pay 
20110121142218.343|20110121142220.147|TR0|right there on the spot, just as 
20110121142220.147|20110121142221.950|TR0|you would never leave the 
20110121142221.950|20110121142223.754|TR0|grocery store without paying 
20110121142223.754|20110121142225.557|TR0|your bill there. That saves 
20110121142225.557|20110121142227.361|TR0|eight percent, we estimate, 
20110121142227.361|20110121142229.164|TR0|according to Dr. William Hsiao, 
20110121142229.164|20110121142230.968|TR0|right off the top. Then we want 
20110121142230.968|20110121142232.771|TR0|to use the same technology to 
20110121142232.771|20110121142234.575|TR0|have our health records on that 
20110121142234.575|20110121142236.378|TR0|card so that providers can 
20110121142236.378|20110121142238.182|TR0|actually know what the last 
20110121142238.182|20110121142239.985|TR0|provider did to you when you 
20110121142239.985|20110121142241.789|TR0|show up. That will get rid of 
20110121142241.789|20110121142243.592|TR0|the duplication and the waste in 
20110121142243.592|20110121142245.396|TR0|the system. And finally, we want 
20110121142245.396|20110121142247.199|TR0|to be the first state in the 
20110121142247.199|20110121142249.003|TR0|country that rewards providers 
20110121142249.003|20110121142250.806|TR0|for keeping you healthy as 
20110121142250.806|20110121142252.610|TR0|opposed the number of tests and 
20110121142252.610|20110121142254.413|TR0|procedures that they run you 
20110121142254.413|20110121142256.216|TR0|through, which happens to be the 
20110121142256.216|20110121142258.020|TR0|current system.
20110121142258.020|20110121142259.823|TR0|
20110121142259.823|20110121142301.627|TR0|The current system in America is 
20110121142301.627|20110121142303.430|TR0|unaffordable. I think Democrats 
20110121142303.430|20110121142305.234|TR0|and Republicans can agree on 
20110121142305.234|20110121142307.037|TR0|that. If we stay on the current 
20110121142307.037|20110121142308.841|TR0|course, we will be spending the 
20110121142308.841|20110121142310.644|TR0|lion's share of our income on 
20110121142310.644|20110121142312.448|TR0|healthcare. It will bankrupt our 
20110121142312.448|20110121142314.251|TR0|businesses. It puts us at a 
20110121142314.251|20110121142316.055|TR0|competitive disadvantage with 
20110121142316.055|20110121142317.858|TR0|all of the other countries who 
20110121142317.858|20110121142319.662|TR0|have figured this out.
20110121142319.662|20110121142321.465|TR0|
20110121142321.465|20110121142323.269|TR0|My vision is that if Vermont can 
20110121142323.269|20110121142325.072|TR0|get this right, the other states 
20110121142325.072|20110121142326.876|TR0|will follow. Now, I've spoken 
20110121142326.876|20110121142328.679|TR0|with the President. We work 
20110121142328.679|20110121142330.483|TR0|together with our congressional 
20110121142330.483|20110121142332.286|TR0|delegation, with Secretary 
20110121142332.286|20110121142334.090|TR0|Sebelius. We need some waivers 
20110121142334.090|20110121142335.893|TR0|to make this happen. And what 
20110121142335.893|20110121142337.697|TR0|they're saying is, "As long as 
20110121142337.697|20110121142339.500|TR0|you're not lowering standards," 
20110121142339.500|20110121142341.303|TR0|which we're not, "we want to 
20110121142341.303|20110121142343.107|TR0|work with you. We want the 
20110121142343.107|20110121142344.910|TR0|states to be laboratories for 
20110121142344.910|20110121142346.714|TR0|change." So, it's an ambitious 
20110121142346.714|20110121142348.517|TR0|goal. We understand the land 
20110121142348.517|20110121142350.321|TR0|mines that lie out there, the 
20110121142350.321|20110121142352.124|TR0|special interests and the folks 
20110121142352.124|20110121142353.928|TR0|who are profiteering from our 
20110121142353.928|20110121142355.731|TR0|healthcare system, but we're 
20110121142355.731|20110121142357.535|TR0|going to give it our best shot 
20110121142357.535|20110121142359.338|TR0|and try, lead the country.

20110121142401.142|20110121142402.945|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Governor 
20110121142402.945|20110121142404.749|TR0|Shumlin, why doesn't it conflict 
20110121142404.749|20110121142406.552|TR0|with Obama's healthcare 
20110121142406.552|20110121142408.356|TR0|proposal? What are the waivers 
20110121142408.356|20110121142410.159|TR0|you would need?
20110121142410.159|20110121142411.963|TR0|
20110121142411.963|20110121142413.766|TR0|>> GOV. PETER SHUMLIN: Well, the 
20110121142413.766|20110121142415.570|TR0|biggest waiver we need - and, 
20110121142415.570|20110121142417.373|TR0|you know, we have an incredible 
20110121142417.373|20110121142419.177|TR0|congressional delegation, 
20110121142419.177|20110121142420.980|TR0|Senator Leahy, Senator Sanders 
20110121142420.980|20110121142422.784|TR0|and Representative Welch - but 
20110121142422.784|20110121142424.587|TR0|the biggest waiver we need is to 
20110121142424.587|20110121142426.390|TR0|ensure that by 2014 we can get 
20110121142426.390|20110121142428.194|TR0|the waivers that we need to 
20110121142428.194|20110121142429.997|TR0|implement this plan. And really 
20110121142429.997|20110121142431.801|TR0|what we want to do is - we're 
20110121142431.801|20110121142433.604|TR0|not asking for one additional 
20110121142433.604|20110121142435.408|TR0|federal dollar. All we're asking 
20110121142435.408|20110121142437.211|TR0|is that we are able to pool our 
20110121142437.211|20110121142439.015|TR0|federal dollars into our 
20110121142439.015|20110121142440.818|TR0|existing system here in Vermont 
20110121142440.818|20110121142442.622|TR0|in a uniform system. And I think 
20110121142442.622|20110121142444.425|TR0|that will appeal, frankly, to 
20110121142444.425|20110121142446.229|TR0|more conservative members of the 
20110121142446.229|20110121142448.032|TR0|Republican Congress. What we're 
20110121142448.032|20110121142449.836|TR0|saying is, give us local 
20110121142449.836|20110121142451.639|TR0|control. Let us go our own way. 
20110121142451.639|20110121142453.443|TR0|We're not asking for more 
20110121142453.443|20110121142455.246|TR0|federal dollars than any other 
20110121142455.246|20110121142457.050|TR0|state. What we are asking is 
20110121142457.050|20110121142458.853|TR0|that you let state rights stand 
20110121142458.853|20110121142500.657|TR0|up and let us design our own 
20110121142500.657|20110121142502.460|TR0|system, using those federal 
20110121142502.460|20110121142504.264|TR0|dollars as we see fit. And I 
20110121142504.264|20110121142506.067|TR0|think that will appeal to, 
20110121142506.067|20110121142507.871|TR0|frankly, some of the Tea Party 
20110121142507.871|20110121142509.674|TR0|governors that I have just been 
20110121142509.674|20110121142511.477|TR0|elected with.
20110121142511.477|20110121142513.281|TR0|
20110121142513.281|20110121142515.084|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Talk about that. 
20110121142515.084|20110121142516.888|TR0|Talk about an alliance with 
20110121142516.888|20110121142518.691|TR0|governors who are saying that 
20110121142518.691|20110121142520.495|TR0|the federal government should 
20110121142520.495|20110121142522.298|TR0|not be involved with this, that 
20110121142522.298|20110121142524.102|TR0|this is breaking the backs of 
20110121142524.102|20110121142525.905|TR0|the budgets of states all over 
20110121142525.905|20110121142527.709|TR0|the country.
20110121142527.709|20110121142529.512|TR0|
20110121142529.512|20110121142531.316|TR0|>> GOV. PETER SHUMLIN: Well, you 
20110121142531.316|20110121142533.119|TR0|know, every governor has their 
20110121142533.119|20110121142534.923|TR0|own particular state to fight 
20110121142534.923|20110121142536.726|TR0|for. Vermont's challenge is 
20110121142536.726|20110121142538.530|TR0|different to some of the other 
20110121142538.530|20110121142540.333|TR0|states. We happen to be proud of 
20110121142540.333|20110121142542.137|TR0|the fact that, because of 
20110121142542.137|20110121142543.940|TR0|Governor Kunin and Dean's 
20110121142543.940|20110121142545.744|TR0|leadership, we're the first 
20110121142545.744|20110121142547.547|TR0|state in the country, through 
20110121142547.547|20110121142549.351|TR0|our program called Dr. Dynasaur, 
20110121142549.351|20110121142551.154|TR0|that insures all of our 
20110121142551.154|20110121142552.958|TR0|children. We're also a state 
20110121142552.958|20110121142554.761|TR0|that insures almost everybody at 
20110121142554.761|20110121142556.564|TR0|300 percent of poverty. So, as 
20110121142556.564|20110121142558.368|TR0|governor, healthcare is the 
20110121142558.368|20110121142600.171|TR0|biggest and least sustainable 
20110121142600.171|20110121142601.975|TR0|part of my state budget. We're 
20110121142601.975|20110121142603.778|TR0|the biggest healthcare provider 
20110121142603.778|20110121142605.582|TR0|in the state. So, you know, in 
20110121142605.582|20110121142607.385|TR0|some of the other states, they 
20110121142607.385|20110121142609.189|TR0|don't have as generous programs. 
20110121142609.189|20110121142610.992|TR0|They approach healthcare 
20110121142610.992|20110121142612.796|TR0|differently, and they should 
20110121142612.796|20110121142614.599|TR0|probably have some flexibility 
20110121142614.599|20110121142616.403|TR0|where they need it, as long as 
20110121142616.403|20110121142618.206|TR0|they don't reduce standards. I 
20110121142618.206|20110121142620.010|TR0|support them having flexibility, 
20110121142620.010|20110121142621.813|TR0|too.
20110121142621.813|20110121142623.617|TR0|
20110121142623.617|20110121142625.420|TR0|My challenge is this: it's about 
20110121142625.420|20110121142627.224|TR0|cost. And I have watched some of 
20110121142627.224|20110121142629.027|TR0|the most capable politicians in 
20110121142629.027|20110121142630.831|TR0|America, from President Obama, 
20110121142630.831|20110121142632.634|TR0|President Clinton, Hillary 
20110121142632.634|20110121142634.438|TR0|Clinton, Howard Dean here in 
20110121142634.438|20110121142636.241|TR0|Vermont, both on a state and 
20110121142636.241|20110121142638.045|TR0|federal level, fail in designing 
20110121142638.045|20110121142639.848|TR0|a system that contains cost. 
20110121142639.848|20110121142641.651|TR0|That is what drags us down. I 
20110121142641.651|20110121142643.455|TR0|believe Vermont can be the first 
20110121142643.455|20110121142645.258|TR0|state in the country that shows 
20110121142645.258|20110121142647.062|TR0|how to get cost containment 
20110121142647.062|20110121142648.865|TR0|right.
20110121142648.865|20110121142650.669|TR0|
20110121142650.669|20110121142652.472|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, and how 
20110121142652.472|20110121142654.276|TR0|would the options you're looking 
20110121142654.276|20110121142656.079|TR0|at affect employers directly, 
20110121142656.079|20110121142657.883|TR0|both the larger employers and 
20110121142657.883|20110121142659.686|TR0|the smaller ones, those who 
20110121142659.686|20110121142701.490|TR0|currently provide insurance or 
20110121142701.490|20110121142703.293|TR0|perhaps more generous insurance 
20110121142703.293|20110121142705.097|TR0|to their workers? How would it 
20110121142705.097|20110121142706.900|TR0|work with the employers?
20110121142706.900|20110121142708.704|TR0|
20110121142708.704|20110121142710.507|TR0|>> GOV. PETER SHUMLIN: Well, 
20110121142710.507|20110121142712.311|TR0|it's my belief that it's not an 
20110121142712.311|20110121142714.114|TR0|employer's responsibility - and 
20110121142714.114|20110121142715.918|TR0|this might surprise you as a 
20110121142715.918|20110121142717.721|TR0|Democrat - but not an employer's 
20110121142717.721|20110121142719.525|TR0|responsibility to provide health 
20110121142719.525|20110121142721.328|TR0|insurance to their employees, 
20110121142721.328|20110121142723.132|TR0|any more than we ask them to pay 
20110121142723.132|20110121142724.935|TR0|for their employees' car 
20110121142724.935|20110121142726.738|TR0|insurance, life insurance or 
20110121142726.738|20110121142728.542|TR0|fire insurance on their home. 
20110121142728.542|20110121142730.345|TR0|What I want to design is a 
20110121142730.345|20110121142732.149|TR0|system where healthcare is a 
20110121142732.149|20110121142733.952|TR0|right, and the healthcare 
20110121142733.952|20110121142735.756|TR0|follows the individual. If we 
20110121142735.756|20110121142737.559|TR0|can take that burden off of the 
20110121142737.559|20110121142739.363|TR0|backs of our employers by using 
20110121142739.363|20110121142741.166|TR0|a broad-based funding mechanism, 
20110121142741.166|20110121142742.970|TR0|as in a payroll tax, other 
20110121142742.970|20110121142744.773|TR0|broad-based revenue sources, to 
20110121142744.773|20110121142746.577|TR0|replace the current dollars, we 
20110121142746.577|20110121142748.380|TR0|will be doing our employers a 
20110121142748.380|20110121142750.184|TR0|huge favor. I believe that the 
20110121142750.184|20110121142751.987|TR0|states that we currently lose 
20110121142751.987|20110121142753.791|TR0|jobs to - frankly, like New 
20110121142753.791|20110121142755.594|TR0|Hampshire to our east, who has 
20110121142755.594|20110121142757.398|TR0|no income tax - those small 
20110121142757.398|20110121142759.201|TR0|businesses will say, "Hey, wait 
20110121142759.201|20110121142801.005|TR0|a minute. If I can get rid of my 
20110121142801.005|20110121142802.808|TR0|biggest rising cost, which is 
20110121142802.808|20110121142804.612|TR0|health insurance to my 
20110121142804.612|20110121142806.415|TR0|employees, by moving to Vermont, 
20110121142806.415|20110121142808.219|TR0|that looks attractive." So, I 
20110121142808.219|20110121142810.022|TR0|think it's a jobs creator. We 
20110121142810.022|20110121142811.825|TR0|have to do it.
20110121142811.825|20110121142813.629|TR0|
20110121142813.629|20110121142815.432|TR0|But the important part is not 
20110121142815.432|20110121142817.236|TR0|how we pay for it. The important 
20110121142817.236|20110121142819.039|TR0|part is, can Vermont be the 
20110121142819.039|20110121142820.843|TR0|state that figures how to 
20110121142820.843|20110121142822.646|TR0|contain cost, because, frankly, 
20110121142822.646|20110121142824.450|TR0|the rising cost of healthcare 
20110121142824.450|20110121142826.253|TR0|will bankrupt America. And 
20110121142826.253|20110121142828.057|TR0|that's what the Republican 
20110121142828.057|20110121142829.860|TR0|Congress, I believe, has all 
20110121142829.860|20110121142831.664|TR0|wrong. The jobs destroyer for us 
20110121142831.664|20110121142833.467|TR0|is the rising cost of 
20110121142833.467|20110121142835.271|TR0|healthcare. That's what's going 
20110121142835.271|20110121142837.074|TR0|to drive jobs out of their 
20110121142837.074|20110121142838.878|TR0|state. That's what's going to 
20110121142838.878|20110121142840.681|TR0|break the banks of the middle 
20110121142840.681|20110121142842.485|TR0|class. And we've got to get this 
20110121142842.485|20110121142844.288|TR0|right. If we keep seeing 
20110121142844.288|20110121142846.092|TR0|healthcare costs rise eight, 10, 
20110121142846.092|20110121142847.895|TR0|12 percent, 20 percent, higher, 
20110121142847.895|20110121142849.699|TR0|much higher than the level of 
20110121142849.699|20110121142851.502|TR0|incomes in America, you know, 
20110121142851.502|20110121142853.306|TR0|our goose is cooked. We will not 
20110121142853.306|20110121142855.109|TR0|compete.
20110121142855.109|20110121142856.912|TR0|
20110121142856.912|20110121142858.716|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, Governor 
20110121142858.716|20110121142900.519|TR0|Shumlin, you are a businessman 
20110121142900.519|20110121142902.323|TR0|yourself. You founded with your 
20110121142902.323|20110121142904.126|TR0|brother Putney Student Travel. I 
20110121142904.126|20110121142905.930|TR0|want to ask about another 
20110121142905.930|20110121142907.733|TR0|business, one of the most 
20110121142907.733|20110121142909.537|TR0|powerful businesses in the 
20110121142909.537|20110121142911.340|TR0|country - it's the insurance 
20110121142911.340|20110121142913.144|TR0|industry - and how they're 
20110121142913.144|20110121142914.947|TR0|responding. I was just reading a 
20110121142914.947|20110121142916.751|TR0|piece by Russell Mokhiber, who 
20110121142916.751|20110121142918.554|TR0|is head of the Corporate Crime 
20110121142918.554|20110121142920.358|TR0|Reporter. He says Vermont's 
20110121142920.358|20110121142922.161|TR0|biggest insurer, "Blue Cross 
20110121142922.161|20110121142923.965|TR0|Blue Shield - with 75 percent of 
20110121142923.965|20110121142925.768|TR0|the state's health insurance 
20110121142925.768|20110121142927.572|TR0|business - signaled [that] it 
20110121142927.572|20110121142929.375|TR0|might be interested in taking 
20110121142929.375|20110121142931.179|TR0|Hsiao at his word." He's the 
20110121142931.179|20110121142932.982|TR0|Harvard economist that Vermont 
20110121142932.982|20110121142934.786|TR0|hired who addressed that joint 
20110121142934.786|20110121142936.589|TR0|session of the legislature. The 
20110121142936.589|20110121142938.393|TR0|Blue Cross-Blue Shield lobbyist 
20110121142938.393|20110121142940.196|TR0|in Vermont said, "If there's a 
20110121142940.196|20110121142941.999|TR0|single payer system, we'd like 
20110121142941.999|20110121142943.803|TR0|to be the single payer." Your 
20110121142943.803|20110121142945.606|TR0|response, Governor Shumlin?
20110121142945.606|20110121142947.410|TR0|
20110121142947.410|20110121142949.213|TR0|>> GOV. PETER SHUMLIN: Well, 
20110121142949.213|20110121142951.017|TR0|he's a smart insurance 
20110121142951.017|20110121142952.820|TR0|executive, and he's got it 
20110121142952.820|20110121142954.624|TR0|right. Listen, here's why we can 
20110121142954.624|20110121142956.427|TR0|do this in Vermont, why we have 
20110121142956.427|20110121142958.231|TR0|a better shot than perhaps 
20110121142958.231|20110121143000.034|TR0|anywhere else in America. Today 
20110121143000.034|20110121143001.838|TR0|is the anniversary of the 
20110121143001.838|20110121143003.641|TR0|Supreme Court decision that 
20110121143003.641|20110121143005.445|TR0|allows corporations to spend 
20110121143005.445|20110121143007.248|TR0|unlimited cash to influence our 
20110121143007.248|20110121143009.052|TR0|elections. What is different 
20110121143009.052|20110121143010.855|TR0|about Vermont is that our 
20110121143010.855|20110121143012.659|TR0|legislators are not in the 
20110121143012.659|20110121143014.462|TR0|pockets of special interests; 
20110121143014.462|20110121143016.266|TR0|they're in the pockets of their 
20110121143016.266|20110121143018.069|TR0|constituents. Now, there's a 
20110121143018.069|20110121143019.873|TR0|very simple reason for that. I 
20110121143019.873|20110121143021.676|TR0|was president of the Senate. My 
20110121143021.676|20110121143023.480|TR0|last campaign cost $2,500. My 
20110121143023.480|20110121143025.283|TR0|counterpart in New York's 
20110121143025.283|20110121143027.086|TR0|campaign, the president of the 
20110121143027.086|20110121143028.890|TR0|Senate just across the lake, 
20110121143028.890|20110121143030.693|TR0|probably cost multiple millions 
20110121143030.693|20110121143032.497|TR0|of dollars. My point is, we have 
20110121143032.497|20110121143034.300|TR0|a citizen legislature in the 
20110121143034.300|20110121143036.104|TR0|state. We are not beholden to 
20110121143036.104|20110121143037.907|TR0|the special interests. We fight 
20110121143037.907|20110121143039.711|TR0|for our constituents in their 
20110121143039.711|20110121143041.514|TR0|best interest. And frankly, our 
20110121143041.514|20110121143043.318|TR0|insurance companies are smart 
20110121143043.318|20110121143045.121|TR0|enough to know that. So, I think 
20110121143045.121|20110121143046.925|TR0|that - you know, we all know 
20110121143046.925|20110121143048.728|TR0|that what's destroying democracy 
20110121143048.728|20110121143050.532|TR0|is the extraordinary influence 
20110121143050.532|20110121143052.335|TR0|of corporate money. The folks 
20110121143052.335|20110121143054.139|TR0|that are making money off the 
20110121143054.139|20110121143055.942|TR0|system then elect the 
20110121143055.942|20110121143057.746|TR0|politicians that make the 
20110121143057.746|20110121143059.549|TR0|decisions about their economic 
20110121143059.549|20110121143101.353|TR0|future. So we have a real 
20110121143101.353|20110121143103.156|TR0|opportunity here, and I think 
20110121143103.156|20110121143104.960|TR0|our insurance companies are 
20110121143104.960|20110121143106.763|TR0|smart enough to see that we're 
20110121143106.763|20110121143108.567|TR0|going to make progress, and they 
20110121143108.567|20110121143110.370|TR0|want to be the company that has 
20110121143110.370|20110121143112.173|TR0|the single payer.
20110121143112.173|20110121143113.977|TR0|
20110121143113.977|20110121143115.780|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, Governor 
20110121143115.780|20110121143117.584|TR0|Shumlin, it's a perfect lead in 
20110121143117.584|20110121143119.387|TR0|to our next segment, which is 
20110121143119.387|20110121143121.191|TR0|precisely about Citizens United. 
20110121143121.191|20110121143122.994|TR0|We'll be speaking with the head 
20110121143122.994|20110121143124.798|TR0|of Common Cause. But before we 
20110121143124.798|20110121143126.601|TR0|do that, Vermont certainly is 
20110121143126.601|20110121143128.405|TR0|not foreign to firsts  --  the 
20110121143128.405|20110121143130.208|TR0|first state whose legislature 
20110121143130.208|20110121143132.012|TR0|voted to legalize gay marriage.

20110121143206.278|20110121143208.081|TR0|you will - are pushing to shut 
20110121143208.081|20110121143209.885|TR0|down Vermont Yankee, which would 
20110121143209.885|20110121143211.688|TR0|make you, Vermont, one of the 
20110121143211.688|20110121143213.492|TR0|first states to shut down a 
20110121143213.492|20110121143215.295|TR0|nuclear power plant. And yet, 
20110121143215.295|20110121143217.099|TR0|you, Governor Shumlin, as a 
20110121143217.099|20110121143218.902|TR0|legislator, were known as the 
20110121143218.902|20110121143220.706|TR0|legislator of Vermont Yankee.

20110121143222.509|20110121143224.313|TR0|>> GOV. PETER SHUMLIN: You mean 
20110121143224.313|20110121143226.116|TR0|a while ago, yeah. Well, you 
20110121143226.116|20110121143227.920|TR0|know, let's talk about nuclear 
20110121143227.920|20110121143229.723|TR0|power, if you wish. You know, 
20110121143229.723|20110121143231.527|TR0|the aging - our biggest 
20110121143231.527|20110121143233.330|TR0|challenge, as we all know, is to 
20110121143233.330|20110121143235.134|TR0|ensure that we pass our planet 
20110121143235.134|20110121143236.937|TR0|on to our kids with a planet 
20110121143236.937|20110121143238.741|TR0|that's livable. And with climate 
20110121143238.741|20110121143240.544|TR0|change - and, you know, we see 
20110121143240.544|20110121143242.347|TR0|the climate change happening in 
20110121143242.347|20110121143244.151|TR0|Vermont, because we're close to 
20110121143244.151|20110121143245.954|TR0|the ground, we're farmers, we 
20110121143245.954|20110121143247.758|TR0|work the land - we understand 
20110121143247.758|20110121143249.561|TR0|the challenges that we have. Our 
20110121143249.561|20110121143251.365|TR0|challenge as a country is to 
20110121143251.365|20110121143253.168|TR0|acknowledge that our aging 
20110121143253.168|20110121143254.972|TR0|nuclear power plants will not 
20110121143254.972|20110121143256.775|TR0|perform beyond their designed 
20110121143256.775|20110121143258.579|TR0|life.
20110121143258.579|20110121143300.382|TR0|
20110121143300.382|20110121143302.186|TR0|We have one, only one, in 
20110121143302.186|20110121143303.989|TR0|Vermont. It was designed to be 
20110121143303.989|20110121143305.793|TR0|shut down in 2012. My feeling 
20110121143305.793|20110121143307.596|TR0|was, for the many years that I 
20110121143307.596|20110121143309.400|TR0|represented the district where 
20110121143309.400|20110121143311.203|TR0|the plant lives, that - and I 
20110121143311.203|20110121143313.007|TR0|was born and raised right in 
20110121143313.007|20110121143314.810|TR0|back of the plant - that we had 
20110121143314.810|20110121143316.614|TR0|a commitment to keep our promise 
20110121143316.614|20110121143318.417|TR0|and run it for 40 years. That 40 
20110121143318.417|20110121143320.221|TR0|years is up in 2012. It's old, 
20110121143320.221|20110121143322.024|TR0|it's tired, and it should be 
20110121143322.024|20110121143323.828|TR0|retired. And, you know, it's 
20110121143323.828|20110121143325.631|TR0|leaking tritium. We are the 
20110121143325.631|20110121143327.434|TR0|environmental state. It's a 
20110121143327.434|20110121143329.238|TR0|hazard in many ways. So, I did 
20110121143329.238|20110121143331.041|TR0|make the decision, as Senate 
20110121143331.041|20110121143332.845|TR0|president, to vote to have it 
20110121143332.845|20110121143334.648|TR0|shut down. We won that vote, and 
20110121143334.648|20110121143336.452|TR0|we expect we will retire it in 
20110121143336.452|20110121143338.255|TR0|2012. I think that more states, 
20110121143338.255|20110121143340.059|TR0|including New York, will find 
20110121143340.059|20110121143341.862|TR0|that this fantasy that we're 
20110121143341.862|20110121143343.666|TR0|living under, that we can run 
20110121143343.666|20110121143345.469|TR0|our aging nuclear power plants 
20110121143345.469|20110121143347.273|TR0|beyond their designed life 
20110121143347.273|20110121143349.076|TR0|without problems and without

20110121143352.683|20110121143354.487|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, and 
20110121143354.487|20110121143356.290|TR0|you're saying - you're 
20110121143356.290|20110121143358.094|TR0|specifically saying the old 
20110121143358.094|20110121143359.897|TR0|nuclear power plants.
20110121143359.897|20110121143401.701|TR0|
20110121143401.701|20110121143403.504|TR0|>> GOV. PETER SHUMLIN: That's 
20110121143403.504|20110121143405.308|TR0|right.
20110121143405.308|20110121143407.111|TR0|
20110121143407.111|20110121143408.915|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Do you have a 
20110121143408.915|20110121143410.718|TR0|position in terms - because, 
20110121143410.718|20110121143412.521|TR0|obviously, the Obama 
20110121143412.521|20110121143414.325|TR0|administration wants to expand 
20110121143414.325|20110121143416.128|TR0|the use of nuclear power, as do 
20110121143416.128|20110121143417.932|TR0|many in the Republican Party, as 
20110121143417.932|20110121143419.735|TR0|well. You're not opposed to the 
20110121143419.735|20110121143421.539|TR0|general expansion of nuclear 
20110121143421.539|20110121143423.342|TR0|power, just the need to shut 
20110121143423.342|20110121143425.146|TR0|down the old ones?
20110121143425.146|20110121143426.949|TR0|
20110121143426.949|20110121143428.753|TR0|>> GOV. PETER SHUMLIN: Well, you 
20110121143428.753|20110121143430.556|TR0|know, I am committed to helping, 
20110121143430.556|20110121143432.360|TR0|in every way we can, to get off 
20110121143432.360|20110121143434.163|TR0|of our addiction to oil as 
20110121143434.163|20110121143435.967|TR0|quickly as we can. And I 
20110121143435.967|20110121143437.770|TR0|actually think that, frankly, 
20110121143437.770|20110121143439.574|TR0|that's the jobs opportunities 
20110121143439.574|20110121143441.377|TR0|for us in America. As we make 
20110121143441.377|20110121143443.181|TR0|the transformation from an 
20110121143443.181|20110121143444.984|TR0|oil-based economy to other 
20110121143444.984|20110121143446.788|TR0|technologies, we have huge 
20110121143446.788|20110121143448.591|TR0|economic opportunities. I want 
20110121143448.591|20110121143450.395|TR0|Vermont to harvest some of 
20110121143450.395|20110121143452.198|TR0|those, in producing windmills 
20110121143452.198|20110121143454.002|TR0|and producing solar panels and 
20110121143454.002|20110121143455.805|TR0|other things that are going to 
20110121143455.805|20110121143457.608|TR0|power this next energy future.
20110121143457.608|20110121143459.412|TR0|
20110121143459.412|20110121143501.215|TR0|Having said that, this is not a 
20110121143501.215|20110121143503.019|TR0|debate in Vermont about nuclear 
20110121143503.019|20110121143504.822|TR0|power; it's about the aging 
20110121143504.822|20110121143506.626|TR0|nuclear power fleet that we're 
20110121143506.626|20110121143508.429|TR0|nurturing in this country. And, 
20110121143508.429|20110121143510.233|TR0|you know, it's really a 
20110121143510.233|20110121143512.036|TR0|different issue. So, I haven't 
20110121143512.036|20110121143513.840|TR0|weighed in on new plants. I have 
20110121143513.840|20110121143515.643|TR0|real concern about what we do 
20110121143515.643|20110121143517.447|TR0|with the waste and all the 
20110121143517.447|20110121143519.250|TR0|promises that have been made and 
20110121143519.250|20110121143521.054|TR0|all the promises that have been 
20110121143521.054|20110121143522.857|TR0|broken. You know, I'm a governor 
20110121143522.857|20110121143524.661|TR0|who has a high-level nuclear 
20110121143524.661|20110121143526.464|TR0|waste dump on the banks of the 
20110121143526.464|20110121143528.268|TR0|Connecticut River, when the 
20110121143528.268|20110121143530.071|TR0|federal government told us that 
20110121143530.071|20110121143531.875|TR0|all of that waste would be gone 
20110121143531.875|20110121143533.678|TR0|when their license was up in 
20110121143533.678|20110121143535.482|TR0|2012. So, I have concerns about 
20110121143535.482|20110121143537.285|TR0|the waste, but I also am very 
20110121143537.285|20110121143539.089|TR0|committed to ensuring that we 
20110121143539.089|20110121143540.892|TR0|get off of our oil-based energy 
20110121143540.892|20110121143542.695|TR0|sources. We must, or we won't 
20110121143542.695|20110121143544.499|TR0|have a planet that our kids can 
20110121143544.499|20110121143546.302|TR0|enjoy.

20110121143622.372|20110121143624.176|TR0|landmark Supreme Court decision,

20110121143625.979|20110121143627.782|TR0|Election Commission. The ruling 
20110121143627.782|20110121143629.586|TR0|lifted a 63-year-old ban 
20110121143629.586|20110121143631.389|TR0|prohibiting corporations, trade 
20110121143631.389|20110121143633.193|TR0|associations and unions from

20110121143645.817|20110121143647.621|TR0|On Thursday, the watchdog group 
20110121143647.621|20110121143649.424|TR0|Common Cause filed a petition 
20110121143649.424|20110121143651.228|TR0|with the Justice Department 
20110121143651.228|20110121143653.031|TR0|urging it to investigate whether

20110121143654.835|20110121143656.638|TR0|Clarence Thomas should have 
20110121143656.638|20110121143658.442|TR0|recused themselves from the case 
20110121143658.442|20110121143700.245|TR0|last year because of a conflict 
20110121143700.245|20110121143702.049|TR0|of interest. Common Cause 
20110121143702.049|20110121143703.852|TR0|alleges that both justices were 
20110121143703.852|20110121143705.656|TR0|paid guests at exclusive

20110121143712.869|20110121143714.673|TR0|around elections. The justices 
20110121143714.673|20110121143716.476|TR0|were among those who provided 
20110121143716.476|20110121143718.280|TR0|the critical votes in the 5-4 
20110121143718.280|20110121143720.083|TR0|ruling, a ruling that has 
20110121143720.083|20110121143721.887|TR0|prompted an unprecedented flood 
20110121143721.887|20110121143723.690|TR0|of corporate expenditures on 
20110121143723.690|20110121143725.494|TR0|electoral campaigns over the

20110121143741.725|20110121143743.529|TR0|are you doing today about 
20110121143743.529|20110121143745.332|TR0|Citizens United? I mean, it was 
20110121143745.332|20110121143747.136|TR0|handed down by the Supreme Court.
20110121143747.136|20110121143748.939|TR0|
20110121143748.939|20110121143750.743|TR0|>> BOB EDGAR: Well, as you know, 
20110121143750.743|20110121143752.546|TR0|Amy, we filed a petition with 
20110121143752.546|20110121143754.350|TR0|the Justice Department to have 
20110121143754.350|20110121143756.153|TR0|them investigate Justice Scalia 
20110121143756.153|20110121143757.956|TR0|and Justice Thomas in terms of 
20110121143757.956|20110121143759.760|TR0|conflict of interest. You'll 
20110121143759.760|20110121143801.563|TR0|recall that just one year ago, 
20110121143801.563|20110121143803.367|TR0|by a five-to-four vote, the 
20110121143803.367|20110121143805.170|TR0|Supreme Court, believing that 
20110121143805.170|20110121143806.974|TR0|corporations are people, voted 
20110121143806.974|20110121143808.777|TR0|to give them the ability to dip 
20110121143808.777|20110121143810.581|TR0|into their corporate treasuries 
20110121143810.581|20110121143812.384|TR0|and spend that on independent 
20110121143812.384|20110121143814.188|TR0|expenditures on campaigns. Over 
20110121143814.188|20110121143815.991|TR0|the course of this year, we've 
20110121143815.991|20110121143817.795|TR0|discovered that Justice Scalia, 
20110121143817.795|20110121143819.598|TR0|in 2007, and Justice Thomas, in 
20110121143819.598|20110121143821.402|TR0|2008, attended a special 
20110121143821.402|20110121143823.205|TR0|workshop seminar sponsored by 
20110121143823.205|20110121143825.009|TR0|the Koch brothers, who run the 
20110121143825.009|20110121143826.812|TR0|second-largest private industry 
20110121143826.812|20110121143828.616|TR0|in the United States, and it 
20110121143828.616|20110121143830.419|TR0|just seemed odd to us that these 
20110121143830.419|20110121143832.223|TR0|two justices would have their 
20110121143832.223|20110121143834.026|TR0|way paid to this special 
20110121143834.026|20110121143835.830|TR0|conference and then, on the 
20110121143835.830|20110121143837.633|TR0|Citizens United case, which 
20110121143837.633|20110121143839.437|TR0|could have been decided on just 
20110121143839.437|20110121143841.240|TR0|the very narrow grounds of the 
20110121143841.240|20110121143843.043|TR0|issues that were brought before 
20110121143843.043|20110121143844.847|TR0|the Court, decided to break that 
20110121143844.847|20110121143846.650|TR0|open and end a ruling that had 
20110121143846.650|20110121143848.454|TR0|been in place for over 60 years 
20110121143848.454|20110121143850.257|TR0|to prevent corporations from 
20110121143850.257|20110121143852.061|TR0|dipping in and playing politics.
20110121143852.061|20110121143853.864|TR0|
20110121143853.864|20110121143855.668|TR0|Our concern is that the Citizens 
20110121143855.668|20110121143857.471|TR0|United case has exponentially 
20110121143857.471|20110121143859.275|TR0|increased the amount of money 
20110121143859.275|20110121143901.078|TR0|that is being spent on 
20110121143901.078|20110121143902.882|TR0|campaigns. It, further, is 
20110121143902.882|20110121143904.685|TR0|putting corporate interests 
20110121143904.685|20110121143906.489|TR0|above the public's interest, and 
20110121143906.489|20110121143908.292|TR0|it needs to be reversed. We're 
20110121143908.292|20110121143910.096|TR0|working with groups who think 
20110121143910.096|20110121143911.899|TR0|that it's possible to get a 
20110121143911.899|20110121143913.703|TR0|constitutional amendment. We 
20110121143913.703|20110121143915.506|TR0|think that's in the long term. 
20110121143915.506|20110121143917.310|TR0|We're working with others who 
20110121143917.310|20110121143919.113|TR0|believe that changing the makeup 
20110121143919.113|20110121143920.917|TR0|of the Court would help to 
20110121143920.917|20110121143922.720|TR0|reverse this awful decision. If 
20110121143922.720|20110121143924.524|TR0|Sandra Day O'Connor had still 
20110121143924.524|20110121143926.327|TR0|been on the Court, this decision 
20110121143926.327|20110121143928.130|TR0|would have been five to four in 
20110121143928.130|20110121143929.934|TR0|the other direction. So it's a 
20110121143929.934|20110121143931.737|TR0|very narrow decision.
20110121143931.737|20110121143933.541|TR0|
20110121143933.541|20110121143935.344|TR0|We think the Justice Department 
20110121143935.344|20110121143937.148|TR0|ought to investigate the 
20110121143937.148|20110121143938.951|TR0|conflict of interest. Remember 
20110121143938.951|20110121143940.755|TR0|that the Justice Department was 
20110121143940.755|20110121143942.558|TR0|on the side of the people 
20110121143942.558|20110121143944.362|TR0|against the final decision that 
20110121143944.362|20110121143946.165|TR0|came down. And Eric Holder, as a 
20110121143946.165|20110121143947.969|TR0|lawyer, has a responsibility to 
20110121143947.969|20110121143949.772|TR0|investigate conflicts of 
20110121143949.772|20110121143951.576|TR0|interest. If they do find that 
20110121143951.576|20110121143953.379|TR0|there is fire where we see 
20110121143953.379|20110121143955.183|TR0|smoke, then he has the 
20110121143955.183|20110121143956.986|TR0|responsibility of asking the 
20110121143956.986|20110121143958.790|TR0|Solicitor General to go to 
20110121143958.790|20110121144000.593|TR0|Justice Roberts, the Chief 
20110121144000.593|20110121144002.397|TR0|Justice of the Supreme Court, 
20110121144002.397|20110121144004.200|TR0|and ask them to investigate and 
20110121144004.200|20110121144006.004|TR0|see whether there are any 
20110121144006.004|20110121144007.807|TR0|remedies. And what we're really 
20110121144007.807|20110121144009.611|TR0|asking is that they vacate the 
20110121144009.611|20110121144011.414|TR0|Citizens United decision and 
20110121144011.414|20110121144013.217|TR0|that Justice Scalia and Justice 
20110121144013.217|20110121144015.021|TR0|Thomas recuse themselves from 
20110121144015.021|20110121144016.824|TR0|working on that decision.
20110121144016.824|20110121144018.628|TR0|
20110121144018.628|20110121144020.431|TR0|One final thing, Justice Thomas 
20110121144020.431|20110121144022.235|TR0|is of particular concern to us. 
20110121144022.235|20110121144024.038|TR0|His wife, Virginia Thomas, was 
20110121144024.038|20110121144025.842|TR0|the leader of something called 
20110121144025.842|20110121144027.645|TR0|Liberty Central. That was an 
20110121144027.645|20110121144029.449|TR0|organization formed to work on 
20110121144029.449|20110121144031.252|TR0|behalf of ultra-conservative 
20110121144031.252|20110121144033.056|TR0|political leaders, mostly 
20110121144033.056|20110121144034.859|TR0|Republicans, and she appeared in 
20110121144034.859|20110121144036.663|TR0|the newspaper as saying that she 
20110121144036.663|20110121144038.466|TR0|believed that that group could 
20110121144038.466|20110121144040.270|TR0|make a difference, and they 
20110121144040.270|20110121144042.073|TR0|could take corporate money for 
20110121144042.073|20110121144043.877|TR0|the first time in recent memory. 
20110121144043.877|20110121144045.680|TR0|We think that particular 
20110121144045.680|20110121144047.484|TR0|conflict of interest should have 
20110121144047.484|20110121144049.287|TR0|been acknowledged by Justice 
20110121144049.287|20110121144051.091|TR0|Thomas and that there really is 
20110121144051.091|20110121144052.894|TR0|an interest there where she is 
20110121144052.894|20110121144054.698|TR0|benefiting from something that 
20110121144054.698|20110121144056.501|TR0|her husband was the deciding 
20110121144056.501|20110121144058.304|TR0|vote on.
20110121144058.304|20110121144100.108|TR0|
20110121144100.108|20110121144101.911|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, Bob 
20110121144101.911|20110121144103.715|TR0|Edgar, to a lot of people, this 
20110121144103.715|20110121144105.518|TR0|seems like a longshot complaint 
20110121144105.518|20110121144107.322|TR0|that you're filing here. What 
20110121144107.322|20110121144109.125|TR0|are the - currently, the 
20110121144109.125|20110121144110.929|TR0|regulations in terms of among 
20110121144110.929|20110121144112.732|TR0|federal judges, in terms of 
20110121144112.732|20110121144114.536|TR0|conflicts of interest and 
20110121144114.536|20110121144116.339|TR0|recusing themselves from 
20110121144116.339|20110121144118.143|TR0|particular cases, as far as you 
20110121144118.143|20110121144119.946|TR0|know? And who monitors that?
20110121144119.946|20110121144121.750|TR0|
20110121144121.750|20110121144123.553|TR0|>> BOB EDGAR: Well, 
20110121144123.553|20110121144125.357|TR0|unfortunately, the justices 
20110121144125.357|20110121144127.160|TR0|monitor their own behavior, and 
20110121144127.160|20110121144128.964|TR0|there are not clear procedures. 
20110121144128.964|20110121144130.767|TR0|If you're sitting on a regular 
20110121144130.767|20110121144132.571|TR0|federal bench, there are rules 
20110121144132.571|20110121144134.374|TR0|and regulations about recusing 
20110121144134.374|20110121144136.178|TR0|oneself. But at the Supreme 
20110121144136.178|20110121144137.981|TR0|Court level, they sometimes 
20110121144137.981|20110121144139.785|TR0|choose to ignore that. I'm very 
20110121144139.785|20110121144141.588|TR0|proud of Justice Kagan, who has 
20110121144141.588|20110121144143.391|TR0|recused herself on issues that 
20110121144143.391|20110121144145.195|TR0|she was only narrowly related to 
20110121144145.195|20110121144146.998|TR0|because she was the Solicitor 
20110121144146.998|20110121144148.802|TR0|General. And there are instances 
20110121144148.802|20110121144150.605|TR0|where the justices have stepped 
20110121144150.605|20110121144152.409|TR0|forward and have been courageous 
20110121144152.409|20110121144154.212|TR0|and voluntarily recused 
20110121144154.212|20110121144156.016|TR0|themselves.
20110121144156.016|20110121144157.819|TR0|
20110121144157.819|20110121144159.623|TR0|But we think that particularly 
20110121144159.623|20110121144201.426|TR0|Scalia and Thomas need to 
20110121144201.426|20110121144203.230|TR0|recognize the appearance of 
20110121144203.230|20110121144205.033|TR0|impropriety. Here is two of the 
20110121144205.033|20110121144206.837|TR0|justices going to a partisan, 
20110121144206.837|20110121144208.640|TR0|political, conservative seminar 
20110121144208.640|20110121144210.444|TR0|and then coming back to the 
20110121144210.444|20110121144212.247|TR0|Court and voting on something 
20110121144212.247|20110121144214.051|TR0|that was discussed at that 
20110121144214.051|20110121144215.854|TR0|seminar. So, we hope that as a 
20110121144215.854|20110121144217.658|TR0|result of our putting this 
20110121144217.658|20110121144219.461|TR0|before the Justice Department, 
20110121144219.461|20110121144221.265|TR0|putting it out in the media, 
20110121144221.265|20110121144223.068|TR0|that it will put enough pressure 
20110121144223.068|20110121144224.872|TR0|on the Court to clean up their 
20110121144224.872|20110121144226.675|TR0|procedures and make sure that as 
20110121144226.675|20110121144228.478|TR0|we move forward on some very 
20110121144228.478|20110121144230.282|TR0|difficult issues, that the 
20110121144230.282|20110121144232.085|TR0|justices will in fact act in the 
20110121144232.085|20110121144233.889|TR0|public's interest and not on the 
20110121144233.889|20110121144235.692|TR0|interest of narrow special 
20110121144235.692|20110121144237.496|TR0|interests, as we think happened 
20110121144237.496|20110121144239.299|TR0|in this case.

20110121144241.103|20110121144242.906|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Bob Edgar, can 
20110121144242.906|20110121144244.710|TR0|you explain more just who 
20110121144244.710|20110121144246.513|TR0|Charles and David Koch are and 
20110121144246.513|20110121144248.317|TR0|their significance in funding 
20110121144248.317|20110121144250.120|TR0|the Tea Party and in the massive 
20110121144250.120|20110121144251.924|TR0|amounts of money that have gone 
20110121144251.924|20110121144253.727|TR0|into elections?
20110121144253.727|20110121144255.531|TR0|
20110121144255.531|20110121144257.334|TR0|>> BOB EDGAR: Well, Charles and 
20110121144257.334|20110121144259.138|TR0|David Koch have, for 30 years, 
20110121144259.138|20110121144300.941|TR0|been at the heart of funding 
20110121144300.941|20110121144302.745|TR0|ultra-conservative operations 
20110121144302.745|20110121144304.548|TR0|across the country - think tanks 
20110121144304.548|20110121144306.352|TR0|and candidates - to try to get 
20110121144306.352|20110121144308.155|TR0|government controlled and 
20110121144308.155|20110121144309.959|TR0|operated for corporate interests 
20110121144309.959|20110121144311.762|TR0|as opposed to the public's 
20110121144311.762|20110121144313.565|TR0|interest. And there's a great 
20110121144313.565|20110121144315.369|TR0|deal of information out there 
20110121144315.369|20110121144317.172|TR0|about the Koch Industries. The 
20110121144317.172|20110121144318.976|TR0|New Yorker had an important 
20110121144318.976|20110121144320.779|TR0|review.
20110121144320.779|20110121144322.583|TR0|
20110121144322.583|20110121144324.386|TR0|Just next week, some of us are 
20110121144324.386|20110121144326.190|TR0|going out to Palm Springs, 
20110121144326.190|20110121144327.993|TR0|because they are having another 
20110121144327.993|20110121144329.797|TR0|one of their special seminars, 
20110121144329.797|20110121144331.600|TR0|and we're just going to have a 
20110121144331.600|20110121144333.404|TR0|silent witness that what they 
20110121144333.404|20110121144335.207|TR0|are doing is not in the best 
20110121144335.207|20110121144337.011|TR0|interest of the nation. They are 
20110121144337.011|20110121144338.814|TR0|funding and fueling an effort to 
20110121144338.814|20110121144340.618|TR0|take power even further away 
20110121144340.618|20110121144342.421|TR0|from average, ordinary citizens 
20110121144342.421|20110121144344.225|TR0|and place it in the hands of the 
20110121144344.225|20110121144346.028|TR0|wealthy, place it in the hands 
20110121144346.028|20110121144347.832|TR0|of corporate interest. And they 
20110121144347.832|20110121144349.635|TR0|have just been very destructive 
20110121144349.635|20110121144351.439|TR0|in our political process - along 
20110121144351.439|20110121144353.242|TR0|with others. There's a whole 
20110121144353.242|20110121144355.046|TR0|host of moneyed interests that 
20110121144355.046|20110121144356.849|TR0|are fueling our campaigns. You 
20110121144356.849|20110121144358.652|TR0|know, very few of your listeners 
20110121144358.652|20110121144400.456|TR0|believe that before the Citizens 
20110121144400.456|20110121144402.259|TR0|United case a year ago, that 
20110121144402.259|20110121144404.063|TR0|corporations didn't have power, 
20110121144404.063|20110121144405.866|TR0|that labor unions didn't have 
20110121144405.866|20110121144407.670|TR0|power in Washington. This simply 
20110121144407.670|20110121144409.473|TR0|opens up the possibility for 
20110121144409.473|20110121144411.277|TR0|excessive power, and it's all 
20110121144411.277|20110121144413.080|TR0|funded by these two brothers.

20110121144414.884|20110121144416.687|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And could you 
20110121144416.687|20110121144418.491|TR0|quantify some of the impact 
20110121144418.491|20110121144420.294|TR0|already of the Citizens United 
20110121144420.294|20110121144422.098|TR0|case, in terms of how it's 
20110121144422.098|20110121144423.901|TR0|already affected the most recent 
20110121144423.901|20110121144425.705|TR0|elections?
20110121144425.705|20110121144427.508|TR0|
20110121144427.508|20110121144429.312|TR0|>> BOB EDGAR: Well, in this most 
20110121144429.312|20110121144431.115|TR0|recent election, corporations 
20110121144431.115|20110121144432.919|TR0|were able to invest in targeted 
20110121144432.919|20110121144434.722|TR0|districts, and we saw the House 
20110121144434.722|20110121144436.526|TR0|go from Democrat to Republican. 
20110121144436.526|20110121144438.329|TR0|And in large measure, attack 
20110121144438.329|20110121144440.133|TR0|ads, TV commercials, that were 
20110121144440.133|20110121144441.936|TR0|for and against particular 
20110121144441.936|20110121144443.739|TR0|candidates, for the first time 
20110121144443.739|20110121144445.543|TR0|in history could be paid for by 
20110121144445.543|20110121144447.346|TR0|the Chamber of Commerce and by 
20110121144447.346|20110121144449.150|TR0|corporations. And because 
20110121144449.150|20110121144450.953|TR0|Congress didn't step in and 
20110121144450.953|20110121144452.757|TR0|successfully pass what was 
20110121144452.757|20110121144454.560|TR0|called the DISCLOSE Act - and 
20110121144454.560|20110121144456.364|TR0|that's another story - the 
20110121144456.364|20110121144458.167|TR0|DISCLOSE Act would have given 
20110121144458.167|20110121144459.971|TR0|all of us the opportunity, 
20110121144459.971|20110121144501.774|TR0|first, to know who was making 
20110121144501.774|20110121144503.578|TR0|those contributions, but 
20110121144503.578|20110121144505.381|TR0|secondly, would have prohibited 
20110121144505.381|20110121144507.185|TR0|foreign corporations from 
20110121144507.185|20110121144508.988|TR0|investing, which they now can 
20110121144508.988|20110121144510.792|TR0|do. Federal contractors, big 
20110121144510.792|20110121144512.595|TR0|Boeing Vertol, could get a large 
20110121144512.595|20110121144514.399|TR0|defense contract and now take 
20110121144514.399|20110121144516.202|TR0|some of that money and spend it 
20110121144516.202|20110121144518.006|TR0|on political campaigns. And we 
20110121144518.006|20110121144519.809|TR0|saw an exponential rise in how 
20110121144519.809|20110121144521.613|TR0|much money was spent in just 
20110121144521.613|20110121144523.416|TR0|this midterm.
20110121144523.416|20110121144525.220|TR0|
20110121144525.220|20110121144527.023|TR0|One of our big fears is, what's 
20110121144527.023|20110121144528.826|TR0|going to happen in the 2012 
20110121144528.826|20110121144530.630|TR0|election? Suppose a rogue 
20110121144530.630|20110121144532.433|TR0|corporation decides they want to 
20110121144532.433|20110121144534.237|TR0|get involved in politics, and 
20110121144534.237|20110121144536.040|TR0|they want to, on day one, put a 
20110121144536.040|20110121144537.844|TR0|billion dollars behind a 
20110121144537.844|20110121144539.647|TR0|particular candidate. There's 
20110121144539.647|20110121144541.451|TR0|nothing that anyone can do about 
20110121144541.451|20110121144543.254|TR0|that, because the Supreme Court 
20110121144543.254|20110121144545.058|TR0|has said corporations are 
20110121144545.058|20110121144546.861|TR0|people, they're covered under 
20110121144546.861|20110121144548.665|TR0|the freedom of speech provisions 
20110121144548.665|20110121144550.468|TR0|of the Constitution, they can do 
20110121144550.468|20110121144552.272|TR0|that. We think, at Common Cause, 
20110121144552.272|20110121144554.075|TR0|that that is a mistake, and 
20110121144554.075|20110121144555.879|TR0|we'll just see the exponential 
20110121144555.879|20110121144557.682|TR0|increase of this. There was a 
20110121144557.682|20110121144559.486|TR0|humorist who suggested that 
20110121144559.486|20110121144601.289|TR0|Congress people wear uniforms 
20110121144601.289|20110121144603.093|TR0|like race car drivers and have 
20110121144603.093|20110121144604.896|TR0|patches on it that show BP and 
20110121144604.896|20110121144606.700|TR0|Exxon and healthcare industry 
20110121144606.700|20110121144608.503|TR0|and insurance companies, so that 
20110121144608.503|20110121144610.307|TR0|you could actually see how much 
20110121144610.307|20110121144612.110|TR0|money is flowing into the 
20110121144612.110|20110121144613.913|TR0|system. While that is a humorous 
20110121144613.913|20110121144615.717|TR0|thought, it has some reality in 
20110121144615.717|20110121144617.520|TR0|it.

20110121144619.324|20110121144621.127|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, hasn't it 
20110121144621.127|20110121144622.931|TR0|already been said that President 
20110121144622.931|20110121144624.734|TR0|Obama hopes to raise over a 
20110121144624.734|20110121144626.538|TR0|billion dollars for the 2012 
20110121144626.538|20110121144628.341|TR0|presidential election?
20110121144628.341|20110121144630.145|TR0|
20110121144630.145|20110121144631.948|TR0|>> BOB EDGAR: Well, I'm glad you 
20110121144631.948|20110121144633.752|TR0|raise that. Common Cause, 
20110121144633.752|20110121144635.555|TR0|working with a whole bunch of 
20110121144635.555|20110121144637.359|TR0|other groups, are interested in 
20110121144637.359|20110121144639.162|TR0|public financing. We installed 
20110121144639.162|20110121144640.966|TR0|that in Arizona, Maine and 
20110121144640.966|20110121144642.769|TR0|Connecticut. We worked very hard 
20110121144642.769|20110121144644.573|TR0|in the last Congress to try to 
20110121144644.573|20110121144646.376|TR0|get it passed for the House and 
20110121144646.376|20110121144648.180|TR0|Senate, to allow for small 
20110121144648.180|20110121144649.983|TR0|contributions to be made, but 
20110121144649.983|20110121144651.787|TR0|for elected officials to 
20110121144651.787|20110121144653.590|TR0|voluntarily not take any special 
20110121144653.590|20110121144655.394|TR0|interest money.
20110121144655.394|20110121144657.197|TR0|
20110121144657.197|20110121144659.000|TR0|There is a presidential public 
20110121144659.000|20110121144700.804|TR0|financing system, which is 
20110121144700.804|20110121144702.607|TR0|broken. It was broken in the '08 
20110121144702.607|20110121144704.411|TR0|election. And we're rather 
20110121144704.411|20110121144706.214|TR0|disappointed that the White 
20110121144706.214|20110121144708.018|TR0|House has not earlier come out 
20110121144708.018|20110121144709.821|TR0|with a reform of the 
20110121144709.821|20110121144711.625|TR0|presidential public financing 
20110121144711.625|20110121144713.428|TR0|system. And now we're caught in 
20110121144713.428|20110121144715.232|TR0|a situation where it's rumored 
20110121144715.232|20110121144717.035|TR0|that next week the House of 
20110121144717.035|20110121144718.839|TR0|Representatives, as its second 
20110121144718.839|20110121144720.642|TR0|act, will bring up the repeal of 
20110121144720.642|20110121144722.446|TR0|the presidential public 
20110121144722.446|20110121144724.249|TR0|financing system. We think that 
20110121144724.249|20110121144726.053|TR0|system has to be repaired. We 
20110121144726.053|20110121144727.856|TR0|think it was broken in '08 and 
20110121144727.856|20110121144729.660|TR0|needs to be fixed for the 2012 
20110121144729.660|20110121144731.463|TR0|election. But we would like to 
20110121144731.463|20110121144733.267|TR0|see some leadership out of the 
20110121144733.267|20110121144735.070|TR0|White House and leadership out 
20110121144735.070|20110121144736.874|TR0|of the Congress to renovate and 
20110121144736.874|20110121144738.677|TR0|reform and improve the 
20110121144738.677|20110121144740.481|TR0|presidential public financing 
20110121144740.481|20110121144742.284|TR0|system that has been in place 
20110121144742.284|20110121144744.087|TR0|for a long time, make the money 
20110121144744.087|20110121144745.891|TR0|adequate, make the timing of 
20110121144745.891|20110121144747.694|TR0|giving the public financing out 
20110121144747.694|20110121144749.498|TR0|to those candidates who 
20110121144749.498|20110121144751.301|TR0|voluntarily accept the system. 
20110121144751.301|20110121144753.105|TR0|Let's get on with making it 
20110121144753.105|20110121144754.908|TR0|happen, so that we don't have a 
20110121144754.908|20110121144756.712|TR0|rush to raising these billions 
20110121144756.712|20110121144758.515|TR0|of dollars for political

20110121144818.354|20110121144820.157|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: This week 
20110121144820.157|20110121144821.961|TR0|marks the 50th anniversary of 
20110121144821.961|20110121144823.764|TR0|the assassination of Patrice 
20110121144823.764|20110121144825.568|TR0|Lumumba. He was the first 
20110121144825.568|20110121144827.371|TR0|democratically elected leader of 
20110121144827.371|20110121144829.174|TR0|what is now known as the 
20110121144829.174|20110121144830.978|TR0|Democratic Republic of the 
20110121144830.978|20110121144832.781|TR0|Congo. The Congo had been a 
20110121144832.781|20110121144834.585|TR0|colony of Belgium since the late 
20110121144834.585|20110121144836.388|TR0|1800s, which ruled over it with 
20110121144836.388|20110121144838.192|TR0|brutality while plundering its 
20110121144838.192|20110121144839.995|TR0|rich natural resources. Patrice 
20110121144839.995|20110121144841.799|TR0|Lumumba rose as a leader of the 
20110121144841.799|20110121144843.602|TR0|Congo's independence movement 
20110121144843.602|20110121144845.406|TR0|and, in 1960, was elected as the 
20110121144845.406|20110121144847.209|TR0|first prime minister of the 
20110121144847.209|20110121144849.013|TR0|country.

20110121144850.816|20110121144852.620|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Lumumba's 
20110121144852.620|20110121144854.423|TR0|pan-Africanism and his vision of 
20110121144854.423|20110121144856.227|TR0|a united Congo gained him many 
20110121144856.227|20110121144858.030|TR0|enemies. Both Belgium and the 
20110121144858.030|20110121144859.834|TR0|United States actively sought to 
20110121144859.834|20110121144901.637|TR0|have Lumumba overthrown or 
20110121144901.637|20110121144903.441|TR0|killed. The CIA ordered his 
20110121144903.441|20110121144905.244|TR0|assassination but could not 
20110121144905.244|20110121144907.048|TR0|complete the job. Instead, the 
20110121144907.048|20110121144908.851|TR0|United States and Belgium 
20110121144908.851|20110121144910.655|TR0|covertly funneled cash and aid 
20110121144910.655|20110121144912.458|TR0|to rival politicians who seized 
20110121144912.458|20110121144914.261|TR0|power and arrested President 
20110121144914.261|20110121144916.065|TR0|Lumumba. This is how it was 
20110121144916.065|20110121144917.868|TR0|reported in a Universal Studios

20110121144928.689|20110121144930.493|TR0|of deposed premier Lumumba, 
20110121144930.493|20110121144932.296|TR0|following his capture by crack

20110121144939.510|20110121144941.314|TR0|Lumumba, but promised the 
20110121144941.314|20110121144943.117|TR0|pro-red Lumumba a fair trial on 
20110121144943.117|20110121144944.921|TR0|charges of inciting the army to 
20110121144944.921|20110121144946.724|TR0|rebellion. Lumumba was removed 
20110121144946.724|20110121144948.528|TR0|to an army prison outside the 
20110121144948.528|20110121144950.331|TR0|capital, as his supporters in 
20110121144950.331|20110121144952.135|TR0|Stanleyville seized control of 
20110121144952.135|20110121144953.938|TR0|Orientale province and 
20110121144953.938|20110121144955.742|TR0|threatened a return of disorder. 
20110121144955.742|20110121144957.545|TR0|Before that, Lumumba suffered 
20110121144957.545|20110121144959.348|TR0|more indignities, including 
20110121144959.348|20110121145001.152|TR0|being forced to eat a speech, 
20110121145001.152|20110121145002.955|TR0|which he restated his claim to 
20110121145002.955|20110121145004.759|TR0|be the Congo's rightful premier. 
20110121145004.759|20110121145006.562|TR0|Even in bonds, Lumumba remains a 
20110121145006.562|20110121145008.366|TR0|dangerous prisoner, storm center 
20110121145008.366|20110121145010.169|TR0|of savage loyalties and equally

20110121145015.580|20110121145017.383|TR0|1961, after being beaten and 
20110121145017.383|20110121145019.187|TR0|tortured, the Congolese prime 
20110121145019.187|20110121145020.990|TR0|minister, Patrice Lumumba, was

20110121145057.060|20110121145058.863|TR0|>> ADAM HOCHSCHILD: Well, Amy, I 
20110121145058.863|20110121145100.667|TR0|think the assassination of 
20110121145100.667|20110121145102.470|TR0|Lumumba was something that was 
20110121145102.470|20110121145104.274|TR0|felt by many people to be a sort 
20110121145104.274|20110121145106.077|TR0|of pivotal turning point in the 
20110121145106.077|20110121145107.881|TR0|saga of Africa gaining its 
20110121145107.881|20110121145109.684|TR0|independence. In the 1950s, 
20110121145109.684|20110121145111.488|TR0|there were movements for 
20110121145111.488|20110121145113.291|TR0|independence all over Africa. 
20110121145113.291|20110121145115.095|TR0|There was a great deal of 
20110121145115.095|20110121145116.898|TR0|idealism in the air. There was a 
20110121145116.898|20110121145118.702|TR0|great deal of hope in the air, 
20110121145118.702|20110121145120.505|TR0|both among Africans and among 
20110121145120.505|20110121145122.309|TR0|their supporters in the United 
20110121145122.309|20110121145124.112|TR0|States and Europe, that at last 
20110121145124.112|20110121145125.916|TR0|these colonies would become 
20110121145125.916|20110121145127.719|TR0|independent. And I think people 
20110121145127.719|20110121145129.522|TR0|imagined real independence - 
20110121145129.522|20110121145131.326|TR0|that is, that these countries 
20110121145131.326|20110121145133.129|TR0|would be able to set off on 
20110121145133.129|20110121145134.933|TR0|their own and control their own 
20110121145134.933|20110121145136.736|TR0|destiny economically as well as 
20110121145136.736|20110121145138.540|TR0|politically. And the 
20110121145138.540|20110121145140.343|TR0|assassination of Lumumba really 
20110121145140.343|20110121145142.147|TR0|signaled that that was not to 
20110121145142.147|20110121145143.950|TR0|be, because, for Belgium, as for 
20110121145143.950|20110121145145.754|TR0|the other major European 
20110121145145.754|20110121145147.557|TR0|colonial powers, like Britain 
20110121145147.557|20110121145149.361|TR0|and France, giving independence 
20110121145149.361|20110121145151.164|TR0|to an African colony was OK for 
20110121145151.164|20110121145152.968|TR0|them as long as it didn't 
20110121145152.968|20110121145154.771|TR0|disturb existing business 
20110121145154.771|20110121145156.575|TR0|arrangements. As long as the 
20110121145156.575|20110121145158.378|TR0|European country could continue 
20110121145158.378|20110121145200.182|TR0|to own the mines, the factories, 
20110121145200.182|20110121145201.985|TR0|the plantations, well, OK, let 
20110121145201.985|20110121145203.789|TR0|them have their politics.
20110121145203.789|20110121145205.592|TR0|
20110121145205.592|20110121145207.396|TR0|But Lumumba spoke very loudly, 
20110121145207.396|20110121145209.199|TR0|very dramatically, saying Africa 
20110121145209.199|20110121145211.003|TR0|needs to be economically 
20110121145211.003|20110121145212.806|TR0|independent, as well. And it was 
20110121145212.806|20110121145214.609|TR0|a fiery speech on this subject 
20110121145214.609|20110121145216.413|TR0|that he gave at the actual 
20110121145216.413|20110121145218.216|TR0|independence ceremonies, June 
20110121145218.216|20110121145220.020|TR0|30th, 1960, where he was 
20110121145220.020|20110121145221.823|TR0|replying to an extremely 
20110121145221.823|20110121145223.627|TR0|arrogant speech by King Baudouin 
20110121145223.627|20110121145225.430|TR0|of Belgium. It was a speech he 
20110121145225.430|20110121145227.234|TR0|gave on this subject that I 
20110121145227.234|20110121145229.037|TR0|think really began the process 
20110121145229.037|20110121145230.841|TR0|that ended two months later with 
20110121145230.841|20110121145232.644|TR0|the CIA, with White House 
20110121145232.644|20110121145234.448|TR0|approval, decreeing that he 
20110121145234.448|20110121145236.251|TR0|should be assassinated.
20110121145236.251|20110121145238.055|TR0|
20110121145238.055|20110121145239.858|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And, of 
20110121145239.858|20110121145241.662|TR0|course, for most Americans, who 
20110121145241.662|20110121145243.465|TR0|- we're not, perhaps, as 
20110121145243.465|20110121145245.269|TR0|familiar with African 
20110121145245.269|20110121145247.072|TR0|colonialism, since that was 
20110121145247.072|20110121145248.876|TR0|basically a European project 
20110121145248.876|20110121145250.679|TR0|throughout the 19th century - 
20110121145250.679|20110121145252.483|TR0|the role of Belgium and the 
20110121145252.483|20110121145254.286|TR0|importance of the Congo as 
20110121145254.286|20110121145256.090|TR0|really the jewel of Africa in 
20110121145256.090|20110121145257.893|TR0|terms of its wealth and 
20110121145257.893|20110121145259.696|TR0|resources - how did the Congo 
20110121145259.696|20110121145301.500|TR0|suffer before Lumumba came to 
20110121145301.500|20110121145303.303|TR0|power?

20110121145305.107|20110121145306.910|TR0|>> ADAM HOCHSCHILD: Well, the 
20110121145306.910|20110121145308.714|TR0|story really begins, in the 
20110121145308.714|20110121145310.517|TR0|modern era, in 1885, when - or 
20110121145310.517|20110121145312.321|TR0|1884 to '85, when all the major 
20110121145312.321|20110121145314.124|TR0|countries of Europe led - 
20110121145314.124|20110121145315.928|TR0|preceded by the United States, 
20110121145315.928|20110121145317.731|TR0|actually; we were the very first 
20110121145317.731|20110121145319.535|TR0|- recognized the Congo not as a 
20110121145319.535|20110121145321.338|TR0|Belgian colony, but as the 
20110121145321.338|20110121145323.142|TR0|private, personally owned colony 
20110121145323.142|20110121145324.945|TR0|of King Leopold II of Belgium, a 
20110121145324.945|20110121145326.749|TR0|very greedy, ambitious man who 
20110121145326.749|20110121145328.552|TR0|wanted a colony of his own. At 
20110121145328.552|20110121145330.356|TR0|that point, Belgium was not sure 
20110121145330.356|20110121145332.159|TR0|that it wanted a colony. Leopold 
20110121145332.159|20110121145333.963|TR0|ruled this place for 23 years, 
20110121145333.963|20110121145335.766|TR0|made an enormous fortune, 
20110121145335.766|20110121145337.570|TR0|estimated at over a billion in 
20110121145337.570|20110121145339.373|TR0|today's American dollars. 
20110121145339.373|20110121145341.177|TR0|Finally, in 1908, he was forced 
20110121145341.177|20110121145342.980|TR0|to give it up to become a 
20110121145342.980|20110121145344.783|TR0|Belgian colony, and then he died 
20110121145344.783|20110121145346.587|TR0|the following year. And the 
20110121145346.587|20110121145348.390|TR0|Belgians ran it for the next 
20110121145348.390|20110121145350.194|TR0|half-century, extracting an 
20110121145350.194|20110121145351.997|TR0|enormous amount of wealth, 
20110121145351.997|20110121145353.801|TR0|initially in ivory and rubber, 
20110121145353.801|20110121145355.604|TR0|then in diamonds, gold, copper, 
20110121145355.604|20110121145357.408|TR0|timber, palm oil, all sorts of 
20110121145357.408|20110121145359.211|TR0|other minerals. And as with 
20110121145359.211|20110121145401.015|TR0|almost all European colonies in 
20110121145401.015|20110121145402.818|TR0|Africa, this wealth flowed back 
20110121145402.818|20110121145404.622|TR0|to Europe. It benefited the 
20110121145404.622|20110121145406.425|TR0|Europeans much more than the 
20110121145406.425|20110121145408.229|TR0|Africans.
20110121145408.229|20110121145410.032|TR0|
20110121145410.032|20110121145411.836|TR0|And the hope that many people 
20110121145411.836|20110121145413.639|TR0|had when independence came all 
20110121145413.639|20110121145415.443|TR0|over Africa, for the most part, 
20110121145415.443|20110121145417.246|TR0|you know, within a few years on 
20110121145417.246|20110121145419.050|TR0|either side of 1960, people had 
20110121145419.050|20110121145420.853|TR0|the hope that at last African 
20110121145420.853|20110121145422.657|TR0|countries would begin to control 
20110121145422.657|20110121145424.460|TR0|their own destiny and that they 
20110121145424.460|20110121145426.264|TR0|would be the ones who would reap 
20110121145426.264|20110121145428.067|TR0|the profits from the mines and 
20110121145428.067|20110121145429.870|TR0|the plantations and so on. 
20110121145429.870|20110121145431.674|TR0|Lumumba put that hope into 
20110121145431.674|20110121145433.477|TR0|words. And for that reason, he 
20110121145433.477|20110121145435.281|TR0|was immediately considered a 
20110121145435.281|20110121145437.084|TR0|very dangerous figure by the 
20110121145437.084|20110121145438.888|TR0|United States and Belgium. The 
20110121145438.888|20110121145440.691|TR0|CIA issued this assassination 
20110121145440.691|20110121145442.495|TR0|order with White House approval. 
20110121145442.495|20110121145444.298|TR0|And as was said at the 
20110121145444.298|20110121145446.102|TR0|beginning, they couldn't get 
20110121145446.102|20110121145447.905|TR0|close enough to him to actually 
20110121145447.905|20110121145449.709|TR0|poison him, but they got money 
20110121145449.709|20110121145451.512|TR0|under the table to Congolese 
20110121145451.512|20110121145453.316|TR0|politicians who did see that he 
20110121145453.316|20110121145455.119|TR0|was assassinated, with Belgian 
20110121145455.119|20110121145456.923|TR0|help. It was a Belgian pilot who 
20110121145456.923|20110121145458.726|TR0|flew the plane to where he was 
20110121145458.726|20110121145500.530|TR0|killed, a Belgian officer who 
20110121145500.530|20110121145502.333|TR0|commanded the firing squad.
20110121145502.333|20110121145504.137|TR0|
20110121145504.137|20110121145505.940|TR0|And then, the really disastrous 
20110121145505.940|20110121145507.744|TR0|thing that followed was this 
20110121145507.744|20110121145509.547|TR0|enthusiastic United States 
20110121145509.547|20110121145511.351|TR0|backing for the dictatorial 
20110121145511.351|20110121145513.154|TR0|regime of Mobutu, who seized 
20110121145513.154|20110121145514.957|TR0|total power a couple years later 
20110121145514.957|20110121145516.761|TR0|and ran a 32-year dictatorship, 
20110121145516.761|20110121145518.564|TR0|enriched himself by about $4 
20110121145518.564|20110121145520.368|TR0|billion, and really ran his 
20110121145520.368|20110121145522.171|TR0|country into the ground, was 
20110121145522.171|20110121145523.975|TR0|greeted by every American 
20110121145523.975|20110121145525.778|TR0|president, with the sole 
20110121145525.778|20110121145527.582|TR0|exception of Jimmy Carter, who 
20110121145527.582|20110121145529.385|TR0|was in office during those 32 
20110121145529.385|20110121145531.189|TR0|years. And he left the country a 
20110121145531.189|20110121145532.992|TR0|wreck, from which it has still 
20110121145532.992|20110121145534.796|TR0|not recovered.
20110121145534.796|20110121145536.599|TR0|
20110121145536.599|20110121145538.403|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Adam Hochschild, 
20110121145538.403|20110121145540.206|TR0|I want to play a clip of the 
20110121145540.206|20110121145542.010|TR0|former CIA agent John Stockwell 
20110121145542.010|20110121145543.813|TR0|talking about the CIA's plans to 
20110121145543.813|20110121145545.617|TR0|assassinate the prime minister 
20110121145545.617|20110121145547.420|TR0|of the Congo, Patrice Lumumba.
20110121145547.420|20110121145549.224|TR0|
20110121145549.224|20110121145551.027|TR0|>> JOHN STOCKWELL: The CIA had 
20110121145551.027|20110121145552.831|TR0|developed a program to 
20110121145552.831|20110121145554.634|TR0|assassinate Lumumba, under 
20110121145554.634|20110121145556.438|TR0|Devlin's encouragement and 
20110121145556.438|20110121145558.241|TR0|management. The program they 
20110121145558.241|20110121145600.044|TR0|developed, the operation, didn't 
20110121145600.044|20110121145601.848|TR0|work. They didn't follow through 
20110121145601.848|20110121145603.651|TR0|on it. It was to give poison to 
20110121145603.651|20110121145605.455|TR0|Lumumba. And they couldn't find 
20110121145605.455|20110121145607.258|TR0|a setting in which to get the 
20110121145607.258|20110121145609.062|TR0|poison to him successfully in a 
20110121145609.062|20110121145610.865|TR0|way that it wouldn't appear to 
20110121145610.865|20110121145612.669|TR0|be a CIA operation. I mean, you 
20110121145612.669|20110121145614.472|TR0|couldn't invite him to a 
20110121145614.472|20110121145616.276|TR0|cocktail party and give him a 
20110121145616.276|20110121145618.079|TR0|drink and have him die a short 
20110121145618.079|20110121145619.883|TR0|time later, obviously. And so, 
20110121145619.883|20110121145621.686|TR0|they gave up on it. They got 
20110121145621.686|20110121145623.490|TR0|cold feet. And instead, they 
20110121145623.490|20110121145625.293|TR0|handled it by the chief of 
20110121145625.293|20110121145627.097|TR0|station talking to Mobutu about 
20110121145627.097|20110121145628.900|TR0|the threat that Lumumba posed, 
20110121145628.900|20110121145630.704|TR0|and Mobutu going out and killing 
20110121145630.704|20110121145632.507|TR0|Lumumba, having his men kill 
20110121145632.507|20110121145634.311|TR0|Lumumba.
20110121145634.311|20110121145636.114|TR0|
20110121145636.114|20110121145637.918|TR0|>> INTERVIEWER: What about the 
20110121145637.918|20110121145639.721|TR0|CIA's relationship with Mobutu? 
20110121145639.721|20110121145641.525|TR0|Were they paying him money?
20110121145641.525|20110121145643.328|TR0|
20110121145643.328|20110121145645.131|TR0|>> JOHN STOCKWELL: Yes, indeed. 
20110121145645.131|20110121145646.935|TR0|I was there in 1968 when the 
20110121145646.935|20110121145648.738|TR0|chief of station told the story 
20110121145648.738|20110121145650.542|TR0|about having been, the day 
20110121145650.542|20110121145652.345|TR0|before that day, having gone to 
20110121145652.345|20110121145654.149|TR0|make payment to Mobutu of cash - 
20110121145654.149|20110121145655.952|TR0|$25,000 - and Mobutu saying, 
20110121145655.952|20110121145657.756|TR0|"Keep the money. I don't need 
20110121145657.756|20110121145659.559|TR0|it." And by then, of course, 
20110121145659.559|20110121145701.363|TR0|Mobutu's European bank account 
20110121145701.363|20110121145703.166|TR0|was so huge that $25,000 was 
20110121145703.166|20110121145704.970|TR0|nothing to him.
20110121145704.970|20110121145706.773|TR0|
20110121145706.773|20110121145708.577|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was former 
20110121145708.577|20110121145710.380|TR0|CIA agent John Stockwell talking 
20110121145710.380|20110121145712.184|TR0|about the CIA's plans to 
20110121145712.184|20110121145713.987|TR0|assassinate Lumumba. Juan?
20110121145713.987|20110121145715.791|TR0|
20110121145715.791|20110121145717.594|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, Adam, 
20110121145717.594|20110121145719.398|TR0|I'd like to ask you - you were 
20110121145719.398|20110121145721.201|TR0|in the Congo shortly after 
20110121145721.201|20110121145723.005|TR0|Lumumba's death. Could you talk 
20110121145723.005|20110121145724.808|TR0|about - we have about a minute - 
20110121145724.808|20110121145726.612|TR0|could you talk about your 
20110121145726.612|20110121145728.415|TR0|personal experiences there and 
20110121145728.415|20110121145730.218|TR0|what you saw?
20110121145730.218|20110121145732.022|TR0|
20110121145732.022|20110121145733.825|TR0|>> ADAM HOCHSCHILD: Yes, I was 
20110121145733.825|20110121145735.629|TR0|there. I was just a college 
20110121145735.629|20110121145737.432|TR0|student at the time. And I wish 
20110121145737.432|20110121145739.236|TR0|I could say that I was smart and 
20110121145739.236|20110121145741.039|TR0|politically knowledgeable enough 
20110121145741.039|20110121145742.843|TR0|to realize the full significance 
20110121145742.843|20110121145744.646|TR0|of everything I was seeing. I 
20110121145744.646|20110121145746.450|TR0|was not, and it was really only 
20110121145746.450|20110121145748.253|TR0|in later years that I began to 
20110121145748.253|20110121145750.057|TR0|understand it. But what I do 
20110121145750.057|20110121145751.860|TR0|remember - and this was, as I 
20110121145751.860|20110121145753.664|TR0|say, six months or so after he 
20110121145753.664|20110121145755.467|TR0|was killed - was the sort of 
20110121145755.467|20110121145757.271|TR0|ominous atmosphere in 
20110121145757.271|20110121145759.074|TR0|Leopoldville, as the capital was 
20110121145759.074|20110121145800.878|TR0|called then, these jeeps full of 
20110121145800.878|20110121145802.681|TR0|soldiers who were patrolling the 
20110121145802.681|20110121145804.485|TR0|streets, the way the streets 
20110121145804.485|20110121145806.288|TR0|quickly emptied at dusk, and 
20110121145806.288|20110121145808.092|TR0|then two very, very arrogant 
20110121145808.092|20110121145809.895|TR0|guys at the American embassy who 
20110121145809.895|20110121145811.699|TR0|were proudly talking over drinks 
20110121145811.699|20110121145813.502|TR0|one evening about how this 
20110121145813.502|20110121145815.305|TR0|person, Lumumba, had been 
20110121145815.305|20110121145817.109|TR0|killed, whom they regarded, you 
20110121145817.109|20110121145818.912|TR0|know, not as a democratically 
20110121145818.912|20110121145820.716|TR0|elected African leader, but as 
20110121145820.716|20110121145822.519|TR0|an enemy of the United States. 
20110121145822.519|20110121145824.323|TR0|And so, of course, I, as a 
20110121145824.323|20110121145826.126|TR0|fellow American, they expected 
20110121145826.126|20110121145827.930|TR0|to be happy that he had been 
20110121145827.930|20110121145829.733|TR0|done away with. There was 
20110121145829.733|20110121145831.537|TR0|something quite chilling about 
20110121145831.537|20110121145833.340|TR0|that, and it stuck with me. But 
20110121145833.340|20110121145835.144|TR0|I think it's only in much later 
20110121145835.144|20110121145836.947|TR0|years that I fully realized the 
20110121145836.947|20110121145838.751|TR0|significance.
