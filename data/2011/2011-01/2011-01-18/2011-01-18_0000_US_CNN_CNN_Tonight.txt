20110118000007.000|20110118000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, HOST:  Thanks Wolf and good 
20110118000009.000|20110118000011.000|TR0|evening everyone.  On this Martin Luther 
20110118000011.000|20110118000014.000|TR0|King, Jr. holiday consider this statistic. 
20110118000014.000|20110118000016.000|TR0| Less than half of Americans today were 
20110118000016.000|20110118000019.000|TR0|alive when the civil rights leader was 
20110118000019.000|20110118000021.000|TR0|slain.  So how do you teach the lessons of 
20110118000021.000|20110118000023.000|TR0|the man and the movement to those growing 
20110118000023.000|20110118000026.000|TR0|up in an America with an African-American 
20110118000026.000|20110118000028.000|TR0|president? We'll ask a Pulitzer

20110118000033.000|20110118000035.000|TR0|And is Michael Reagan right when he says 
20110118000035.000|20110118000038.000|TR0|his father, Ronald Reagan, was a better 
20110118000038.000|20110118000040.000|TR0|president for black Americans than Bill 
20110118000040.000|20110118000043.000|TR0|Clinton or Barack Obama?  We'll ask one of 
20110118000043.000|20110118000045.000|TR0|the country's leading young African

20110118000102.000|20110118000104.000|TR0|a time when we could actually afford

20110118000143.000|20110118000145.000|TR0|the assassin's prime target, Congresswoman 
20110118000145.000|20110118000148.000|TR0|Gabrielle Giffords, including word she 
20110118000148.000|20110118000150.000|TR0|could be moved from the hospital to a

20110118000205.000|20110118000207.000|TR0|at all their resources.  They have the 
20110118000207.000|20110118000210.000|TR0|entire country available.  It has to be in 
20110118000210.000|20110118000212.000|TR0|a place that is not only top-notch in 
20110118000212.000|20110118000214.000|TR0|terms of the ability to render care and 
20110118000214.000|20110118000217.000|TR0|rehabilitation, but also proximity to 
20110118000217.000|20110118000219.000|TR0|family is very important.

20110118000231.000|20110118000234.000|TR0|eye socket that was damaged in the 
20110118000234.000|20110118000236.000|TR0|shooting. That surgery went well the 
20110118000236.000|20110118000239.000|TR0|doctors said and they also relayed 
20110118000239.000|20110118000241.000|TR0|positive word from the congresswoman's

20110118000253.000|20110118000255.000|TR0|he may have seen a smile.  We're all very 
20110118000255.000|20110118000258.000|TR0|optimistic.  So we could be wrong, but we 
20110118000258.000|20110118000300.000|TR0|all want to see the best and sometimes we 
20110118000300.000|20110118000303.000|TR0|see what we want to see.  But if he says 
20110118000303.000|20110118000305.000|TR0|she's smiling, I buy it.

20110118000315.000|20110118000317.000|TR0|Lee Loughner's defense team is all but 
20110118000317.000|20110118000320.000|TR0|certain to try to move his trial out of 
20110118000320.000|20110118000322.000|TR0|Arizona, most likely to California.  But 
20110118000322.000|20110118000324.000|TR0|the Justice Department says it would fight 
20110118000324.000|20110118000327.000|TR0|such an attempt and try to keep the trial 
20110118000327.000|20110118000329.000|TR0|in the federal courts in Phoenix.

20110118000430.000|20110118000432.000|TR0|KING:  The man who shouted "you're dead" 
20110118000432.000|20110118000434.000|TR0|was 63-year-old James Eric Fuller.  He was 
20110118000434.000|20110118000437.000|TR0|among those shot at the Giffords event 10 
20110118000437.000|20110118000439.000|TR0|days ago.  Fuller was taken from that 
20110118000439.000|20110118000442.000|TR0|event in order to undergo a psychiatric 
20110118000442.000|20110118000444.000|TR0|examination.  Tonight Fuller's girlfriend 
20110118000444.000|20110118000446.000|TR0|tells CNN he asked her to convey that he 
20110118000446.000|20110118000449.000|TR0|is quote, "apologetic and very sad."  And 
20110118000449.000|20110118000451.000|TR0|she says Fuller quote, "wishes he could go 
20110118000451.000|20110118000454.000|TR0|back and do things differently."
20110118000454.000|20110118000456.000|TR0|
20110118000456.000|20110118000459.000|TR0|The man at the receiving of that outburst, 
20110118000459.000|20110118000501.000|TR0|the Tucson Tea Party leader, Trent 
20110118000501.000|20110118000503.000|TR0|Humphries, is with us now.  And Mr. 
20110118000503.000|20110118000506.000|TR0|Humphries, let me just start with a very 
20110118000506.000|20110118000508.000|TR0|simple question.  Has that apology been 
20110118000508.000|20110118000511.000|TR0|relayed to you personally, and whether it 
20110118000511.000|20110118000513.000|TR0|has or has not, do you accept it?
20110118000513.000|20110118000515.000|TR0|
20110118000515.000|20110118000518.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  No, I mean, I haven't heard 
20110118000518.000|20110118000520.000|TR0|from them.  I mean, it's something that 
20110118000520.000|20110118000523.000|TR0|hasn't been told to me personally.  I've 
20110118000523.000|20110118000525.000|TR0|heard it through the news stories just 
20110118000525.000|20110118000528.000|TR0|like everybody else, but you know 
20110118000528.000|20110118000530.000|TR0|apologies don't really have anything to do 
20110118000530.000|20110118000532.000|TR0|with what's going on right now.  And so, I 
20110118000532.000|20110118000535.000|TR0|mean, if he does feel remorse, and he does 
20110118000535.000|20110118000537.000|TR0|you know regret what happened, and he's 
20110118000537.000|20110118000540.000|TR0|coming to his senses, that's positive, 
20110118000540.000|20110118000542.000|TR0|happy news and I hope that continues.

20110118000544.000|20110118000547.000|TR0|KING:  Take us back inside that room.  As 
20110118000547.000|20110118000549.000|TR0|we just replayed it for our viewers we can 
20110118000549.000|20110118000552.000|TR0|hear you speaking because you have a 
20110118000552.000|20110118000554.000|TR0|microphone. Mr. Fuller gets up and says 
20110118000554.000|20110118000556.000|TR0|"you're dead."  And you can just barely 
20110118000556.000|20110118000559.000|TR0|hear him if you listen closely on the 
20110118000559.000|20110118000601.000|TR0|tape.  Could you hear him?  You went on as 
20110118000601.000|20110118000604.000|TR0|if either you didn't quite hear it or you 
20110118000604.000|20110118000606.000|TR0|just decided you were going to keep going. 
20110118000606.000|20110118000609.000|TR0| What went through your head as it 
20110118000609.000|20110118000611.000|TR0|happened? Did you hear him clearly?
20110118000611.000|20110118000613.000|TR0|
20110118000613.000|20110118000616.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  Well I thought I misheard him 
20110118000616.000|20110118000618.000|TR0|obviously.  I said well he just didn't say 
20110118000618.000|20110118000621.000|TR0|that, so I tended to hope that he didn't 
20110118000621.000|20110118000623.000|TR0|say it and as I continued saying what I 
20110118000623.000|20110118000625.000|TR0|was saying I -- you know and then after I 
20110118000625.000|20110118000628.000|TR0|sat down, everybody else just looked at me 
20110118000628.000|20110118000630.000|TR0|like -- you know horrified looks about 
20110118000630.000|20110118000633.000|TR0|what had just happened.  So I said you 
20110118000633.000|20110118000635.000|TR0|know he must have really said that and I 
20110118000635.000|20110118000638.000|TR0|was just -- I was hoping not.
20110118000638.000|20110118000640.000|TR0|
20110118000640.000|20110118000642.000|TR0|I was hoping that wasn't the case.  
20110118000642.000|20110118000645.000|TR0|Obviously nobody wants to see that.  I 
20110118000645.000|20110118000647.000|TR0|mean I can deal with the catcalls and 
20110118000647.000|20110118000650.000|TR0|boos.  You know that's something that 
20110118000650.000|20110118000652.000|TR0|happens, I guess, in today's politics.  
20110118000652.000|20110118000654.000|TR0|But yes, threats, threats are a little 
20110118000654.000|20110118000657.000|TR0|beyond the pale, I think.
20110118000657.000|20110118000659.000|TR0|
20110118000659.000|20110118000702.000|TR0|KING:  Well when you realized that that is 
20110118000702.000|20110118000704.000|TR0|what he had said, "you're dead", what went 
20110118000704.000|20110118000706.000|TR0|through your mind and did you think at 
20110118000706.000|20110118000709.000|TR0|all, where's this coming from?
20110118000709.000|20110118000711.000|TR0|
20110118000711.000|20110118000714.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  Well, yes.  I mean obviously 
20110118000714.000|20110118000716.000|TR0|it went really fast.  I mean as soon as I 
20110118000716.000|20110118000719.000|TR0|sat down they closed the program and the 
20110118000719.000|20110118000721.000|TR0|sheriff's deputies had me out of there 
20110118000721.000|20110118000723.000|TR0|within just moments.  It wasn't something 
20110118000723.000|20110118000726.000|TR0|where we got to sit down and think about 
20110118000726.000|20110118000728.000|TR0|what happened or I got to even draw eye 
20110118000728.000|20110118000731.000|TR0|contact with Mr. Fuller or, you know, kind 
20110118000731.000|20110118000733.000|TR0|of engage him at all.  The sheriff's 
20110118000733.000|20110118000735.000|TR0|deputies you know separated me out of the 
20110118000735.000|20110118000738.000|TR0|crowd pretty quickly.
20110118000738.000|20110118000740.000|TR0|
20110118000740.000|20110118000743.000|TR0|KING:  I want to just continue this 
20110118000743.000|20110118000745.000|TR0|conversation, but first I want to go back. 
20110118000745.000|20110118000748.000|TR0| I sat down with you when I was in Tucson 
20110118000748.000|20110118000750.000|TR0|last week. We had a remarkable lunch.  It 
20110118000750.000|20110118000752.000|TR0|was yourself, the head of the Tea Party, 
20110118000752.000|20110118000755.000|TR0|the head of the Republican Party -- you 
20110118000755.000|20110118000757.000|TR0|don't always get along with politically 
20110118000757.000|20110118000800.000|TR0|anyway, and the head of the Democratic 
20110118000800.000|20110118000802.000|TR0|Party and we were talking about yes, you 
20110118000802.000|20110118000804.000|TR0|guys are divided politically, but at that 
20110118000804.000|20110118000807.000|TR0|moment right after the shooting how 
20110118000807.000|20110118000809.000|TR0|perhaps you could work together on several 
20110118000809.000|20110118000812.000|TR0|things in the community.  I want our 
20110118000812.000|20110118000814.000|TR0|viewers to listen and for you to listen 
20110118000814.000|20110118000816.000|TR0|again to something you said during that 
20110118000816.000|20110118000819.000|TR0|conversation.
20110118000819.000|20110118000821.000|TR0|

20110118000826.000|20110118000829.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  There has to be responsibility 
20110118000829.000|20110118000831.000|TR0|taken on both sides. All that mail in my 
20110118000831.000|20110118000833.000|TR0|inbox came almost directly from the 
20110118000833.000|20110118000836.000|TR0|comments the sheriff made and people 
20110118000836.000|20110118000838.000|TR0|blaming my organization for what happened. 
20110118000838.000|20110118000841.000|TR0|And nobody in inn this city, nobody in 
20110118000841.000|20110118000843.000|TR0|this town that knows me and my 
20110118000843.000|20110118000845.000|TR0|organization believed that to be the case.
20110118000845.000|20110118000848.000|TR0|

20110118000853.000|20110118000855.000|TR0|KING:  You were saying there back -- this 
20110118000855.000|20110118000858.000|TR0|is back then.  This is just a couple of 
20110118000858.000|20110118000900.000|TR0|days after the shooting that already you 
20110118000900.000|20110118000902.000|TR0|were getting hate mail.  Has that 
20110118000902.000|20110118000905.000|TR0|continued, sir?  Have you received other 
20110118000905.000|20110118000907.000|TR0|threats, other hate mail, other death 
20110118000907.000|20110118000910.000|TR0|threats?
20110118000910.000|20110118000912.000|TR0|
20110118000912.000|20110118000914.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  Well I think people are being 
20110118000914.000|20110118000917.000|TR0|very circumspect on the threats now.  I'm 
20110118000917.000|20110118000919.000|TR0|still getting a lot of hate mail.  You 
20110118000919.000|20110118000922.000|TR0|know that people are being very careful, 
20110118000922.000|20110118000924.000|TR0|obviously knowing there's an ongoing 
20110118000924.000|20110118000926.000|TR0|investigation, they're not going to put 
20110118000926.000|20110118000929.000|TR0|themselves in danger in that particular 
20110118000929.000|20110118000931.000|TR0|way.  People -- I guess people are 
20110118000931.000|20110118000934.000|TR0|probably paying a little more attention to 
20110118000934.000|20110118000936.000|TR0|what might be construed as a threat, as 
20110118000936.000|20110118000939.000|TR0|compared to just run of the mill nastiness.
20110118000939.000|20110118000941.000|TR0|
20110118000941.000|20110118000943.000|TR0|But I guess that's an upgrade.  But, yes 
20110118000943.000|20110118000946.000|TR0|-- we're still getting people saying that 
20110118000946.000|20110118000948.000|TR0|you know how could you do this to this 
20110118000948.000|20110118000951.000|TR0|poor man? And you know, again, it's not 
20110118000951.000|20110118000953.000|TR0|something I wanted to have happen.  It's 
20110118000953.000|20110118000955.000|TR0|not something I sought out, you know and 
20110118000955.000|20110118000958.000|TR0|if we could go back and not have this 
20110118000958.000|20110118001000.000|TR0|happen, by all means we'd do that.  But 
20110118001000.000|20110118001003.000|TR0|that's not where we're at.
20110118001003.000|20110118001005.000|TR0|
20110118001005.000|20110118001008.000|TR0|KING:  So what is then your own thinking?  
20110118001008.000|20110118001010.000|TR0|We are now 10 days removed from this and 
20110118001010.000|20110118001012.000|TR0|when I was in Tucson for several days last 
20110118001012.000|20110118001015.000|TR0|week, and you have heard it in your 
20110118001015.000|20110118001017.000|TR0|community, you have heard it here in 
20110118001017.000|20110118001020.000|TR0|Washington, D.C. that no, you can't 
20110118001020.000|20110118001022.000|TR0|connect the dots between any vitriolic 
20110118001022.000|20110118001024.000|TR0|rhetoric, any politician's speech and what 
20110118001024.000|20110118001027.000|TR0|happened.  But maybe if we could all learn 
20110118001027.000|20110118001029.000|TR0|a lesson we could learn to be more polite, 
20110118001029.000|20110118001032.000|TR0|be more civil, be more about the issues 
20110118001032.000|20110118001034.000|TR0|and less about the personalities in our 
20110118001034.000|20110118001036.000|TR0|political discourse.  Where is Trent 
20110118001036.000|20110118001039.000|TR0|Humphries on that question?
20110118001039.000|20110118001041.000|TR0|
20110118001041.000|20110118001044.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  You know again, I've seen -- 
20110118001044.000|20110118001046.000|TR0|I've seen things that, you know -- you 
20110118001046.000|20110118001049.000|TR0|know, we're still trying to come to grips 
20110118001049.000|20110118001051.000|TR0|with the tragedy in the neighborhood.  You 
20110118001051.000|20110118001053.000|TR0|know that's still part of this.  You know, 
20110118001053.000|20110118001056.000|TR0|and we're happy to hear about the news you 
20110118001056.000|20110118001058.000|TR0|just reported about Representative 
20110118001058.000|20110118001101.000|TR0|Giffords and hope that her -- you know she 
20110118001101.000|20110118001103.000|TR0|continues to get better because that's a 
20110118001103.000|20110118001105.000|TR0|happy thing we can focus on.
20110118001105.000|20110118001108.000|TR0|
20110118001108.000|20110118001110.000|TR0|You know, but as far as the rhetoric goes, 
20110118001110.000|20110118001113.000|TR0|you know again we've tried and we've done 
20110118001113.000|20110118001115.000|TR0|our best to you know to be as civil as 
20110118001115.000|20110118001118.000|TR0|possible, but disagree.  You know as Barry 
20110118001118.000|20110118001120.000|TR0|Goldwater said, you know you can disagree 
20110118001120.000|20110118001122.000|TR0|without being disagreeable.  And we've 
20110118001122.000|20110118001125.000|TR0|done our best to try to do that.  And I 
20110118001125.000|20110118001127.000|TR0|just -- it pains me to see that there are 
20110118001127.000|20110118001130.000|TR0|just so many people, you know, and so many 
20110118001130.000|20110118001132.000|TR0|things that push this.
20110118001132.000|20110118001134.000|TR0|
20110118001134.000|20110118001137.000|TR0|You know again, if you want to say it 
20110118001137.000|20110118001139.000|TR0|happens on the right, that's fair.  But 
20110118001139.000|20110118001142.000|TR0|you know there's things that pushed Mr. 
20110118001142.000|20110118001144.000|TR0|Fuller to act the way he did too.  You 
20110118001144.000|20110118001146.000|TR0|know if you look at his previous activism 
20110118001146.000|20110118001149.000|TR0|and the things that he was talking about, 
20110118001149.000|20110118001151.000|TR0|you know, that wasn't helpful either and a 
20110118001151.000|20110118001154.000|TR0|lot of that was perpetrated, not just by 
20110118001154.000|20110118001156.000|TR0|you know whispers in the shadows, but "The 
20110118001156.000|20110118001159.000|TR0|New York Times", you know Paul Krugman.  
20110118001159.000|20110118001201.000|TR0|Our own sheriff you know perpetrated those 
20110118001201.000|20110118001203.000|TR0|things.  And it's just been unfortunate to 
20110118001203.000|20110118001206.000|TR0|see it, you know -- that it's come to 
20110118001206.000|20110118001208.000|TR0|this, you know.
20110118001208.000|20110118001211.000|TR0|

20110118001220.000|20110118001223.000|TR0|KING:  Well, we're in this political 
20110118001223.000|20110118001225.000|TR0|environment.  You just made those points 
20110118001225.000|20110118001228.000|TR0|about some on the left and I know there 
20110118001228.000|20110118001230.000|TR0|are people watching who will immediately 
20110118001230.000|20110118001232.000|TR0|say, no way, and they will get involved. 
20110118001232.000|20110118001235.000|TR0|And some of that's healthy political give 
20110118001235.000|20110118001237.000|TR0|and take.  Some of it I'm not so sure is 
20110118001237.000|20110118001240.000|TR0|quite so healthy at this particular 
20110118001240.000|20110118001242.000|TR0|moment.  But if you're going to criticize 
20110118001242.000|20110118001244.000|TR0|those on the left and you just did and 
20110118001244.000|20110118001247.000|TR0|that is fully your right, sir, I want to 
20110118001247.000|20110118001249.000|TR0|read you something that a fellow Tea Party 
20110118001249.000|20110118001252.000|TR0|leader wrote just yesterday.
20110118001252.000|20110118001254.000|TR0|
20110118001254.000|20110118001256.000|TR0|I want to ask you just straight up is this 
20110118001256.000|20110118001259.000|TR0|over the line?  This is from Judson 
20110118001259.000|20110118001301.000|TR0|Philips (ph) from the Tea Party Nation.  
20110118001301.000|20110118001304.000|TR0|He puts this on their forum yesterday, 
20110118001304.000|20110118001306.000|TR0|responding to an op-ed piece that Senator 
20110118001306.000|20110118001309.000|TR0|John McCain, a Republican, wrote in "The 
20110118001309.000|20110118001311.000|TR0|Washington Post".
20110118001311.000|20110118001313.000|TR0|
20110118001313.000|20110118001316.000|TR0|"What we've seen from Obama is not an 
20110118001316.000|20110118001318.000|TR0|incompetent fool.  He knows exactly what 
20110118001318.000|20110118001321.000|TR0|he is doing.  From being raised by a 
20110118001321.000|20110118001323.000|TR0|mother who hated America, to associating 
20110118001323.000|20110118001325.000|TR0|with America-hating communists in his 
20110118001325.000|20110118001328.000|TR0|youth, he gravitated to 
20110118001328.000|20110118001330.000|TR0|communist-America-hating professors in 
20110118001330.000|20110118001333.000|TR0|college and associated with America-hating 
20110118001333.000|20110118001335.000|TR0|political groups until it looked like he 
20110118001335.000|20110118001338.000|TR0|might actually go somewhere in his 
20110118001338.000|20110118001340.000|TR0|political career.  Obama is no patriot and 
20110118001340.000|20110118001342.000|TR0|neither is McCain."
20110118001342.000|20110118001345.000|TR0|
20110118001345.000|20110118001347.000|TR0|Do you think the president is an 
20110118001347.000|20110118001350.000|TR0|America-hater or associated with 
20110118001350.000|20110118001352.000|TR0|America-haters until he realized he was 
20110118001352.000|20110118001354.000|TR0|going to run for political office?  Is 
20110118001354.000|20110118001357.000|TR0|John McCain not a patriot?
20110118001357.000|20110118001359.000|TR0|
20110118001359.000|20110118001402.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  No, I mean, look, I spoke with 
20110118001402.000|20110118001404.000|TR0|John McCain, I've had John McCain call me 
20110118001404.000|20110118001406.000|TR0|on the phone a couple of times about 
20110118001406.000|20110118001409.000|TR0|things that are pending.  You know I mean 
20110118001409.000|20110118001411.000|TR0|we've not always agreed with John McCain, 
20110118001411.000|20110118001414.000|TR0|but I would never say he was not a 
20110118001414.000|20110118001416.000|TR0|patriot.  And as far as Barack Obama goes, 
20110118001416.000|20110118001419.000|TR0|you know again, it's possible to disagree 
20110118001419.000|20110118001421.000|TR0|with people without them being your enemy. 
20110118001421.000|20110118001423.000|TR0| I'd hope that we could get to that where 
20110118001423.000|20110118001426.000|TR0|we should be as a country.  You know I 
20110118001426.000|20110118001428.000|TR0|don't subscribe to any of those.  We're 
20110118001428.000|20110118001431.000|TR0|not followers or even affiliated with the 
20110118001431.000|20110118001433.000|TR0|gentleman you just spoke about.  You know 
20110118001433.000|20110118001435.000|TR0|and yes, there are --
20110118001435.000|20110118001438.000|TR0|
20110118001438.000|20110118001440.000|TR0|KING:  Yet people -- yet people will say 
20110118001440.000|20110118001443.000|TR0|he has a -- I understand, and you're 
20110118001443.000|20110118001445.000|TR0|right, there's many loosely knit Tea Party 
20110118001445.000|20110118001448.000|TR0|groups all across the country.  Some work 
20110118001448.000|20110118001450.000|TR0|with others, some don't. But they just 
20110118001450.000|20110118001452.000|TR0|have the Tea Party label.  But as someone 
20110118001452.000|20110118001455.000|TR0|who is trying to establish and grow a 
20110118001455.000|20110118001457.000|TR0|movement in American politics that you 
20110118001457.000|20110118001500.000|TR0|call the Tea Party, would you say to Mr. 
20110118001500.000|20110118001502.000|TR0|Philips (ph), sir, in my view, if you're 
20110118001502.000|20110118001504.000|TR0|going to use the Tea Party name that is 
20110118001504.000|20110118001507.000|TR0|across the line?
20110118001507.000|20110118001509.000|TR0|
20110118001509.000|20110118001512.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  Well I just -- I would hope 
20110118001512.000|20110118001514.000|TR0|that he wouldn't speak for the Tea Party 
20110118001514.000|20110118001516.000|TR0|in general.  That's what hurts me is that 
20110118001516.000|20110118001519.000|TR0|look, Tea Party groups should be local in 
20110118001519.000|20110118001521.000|TR0|nature.  They shouldn't -- there shouldn't 
20110118001521.000|20110118001524.000|TR0|be -- I don't believe there should be 
20110118001524.000|20110118001526.000|TR0|national Tea Party movements.  Now they 
20110118001526.000|20110118001529.000|TR0|should -- national issues but the Tea 
20110118001529.000|20110118001531.000|TR0|Party works is more effective when it's 
20110118001531.000|20110118001533.000|TR0|local.  You know again, where you're part 
20110118001533.000|20110118001536.000|TR0|of the community, where you have friends 
20110118001536.000|20110118001538.000|TR0|on both sides, where you're so close to 
20110118001538.000|20110118001541.000|TR0|the action that your brother's a Democrat 
20110118001541.000|20110118001543.000|TR0|or doesn't believe the same way you do.
20110118001543.000|20110118001545.000|TR0|
20110118001545.000|20110118001548.000|TR0|You know and again that's how -- that's 
20110118001548.000|20110118001550.000|TR0|where the conversation's helpful.  And, 
20110118001550.000|20110118001553.000|TR0|you know some of these people in different 
20110118001553.000|20110118001555.000|TR0|groups -- I mean they -- I'll be honest 
20110118001555.000|20110118001558.000|TR0|with you, some of the so-called national 
20110118001558.000|20110118001600.000|TR0|Tea Party groups, they make statements all 
20110118001600.000|20110118001602.000|TR0|the time that make me cringe.  But I'm not 
20110118001602.000|20110118001605.000|TR0|affiliated with them, I can't control 
20110118001605.000|20110118001607.000|TR0|them. There's nothing I can do, no, but we 
20110118001607.000|20110118001610.000|TR0|don't -- we don't -- we don't subscribe to 
20110118001610.000|20110118001612.000|TR0|what they say because we're our own group. 
20110118001612.000|20110118001614.000|TR0| We do what we're supposed to do in our 
20110118001614.000|20110118001617.000|TR0|own local community.  And I think by and 
20110118001617.000|20110118001619.000|TR0|large that's what the Tea Party is.
20110118001619.000|20110118001622.000|TR0|
20110118001622.000|20110118001624.000|TR0|KING:  Trent Humphries is the Tucson Tea 
20110118001624.000|20110118001626.000|TR0|Party leader.  Sir, we appreciate your 
20110118001626.000|20110118001629.000|TR0|time tonight.  We'll keep in touch.
20110118001629.000|20110118001631.000|TR0|
20110118001631.000|20110118001634.000|TR0|HUMPHRIES:  No problem.
20110118001634.000|20110118001636.000|TR0|
20110118001636.000|20110118001639.000|TR0|KING:  Thank you.  Still ahead tonight, 
20110118001639.000|20110118001641.000|TR0|Apple CEO Steve Jobs takes a medical 
20110118001641.000|20110118001643.000|TR0|leave.  Will that impact the next 
20110118001643.000|20110118001646.000|TR0|generation iPad or the company's stock 
20110118001646.000|20110118001648.000|TR0|price?

20110118001651.000|20110118001653.000|TR0|And up next, it is still officially called 
20110118001653.000|20110118001655.000|TR0|quote, "repealing the job-killing health 
20110118001655.000|20110118001658.000|TR0|care law act", but when House Republicans 
20110118001658.000|20110118001700.000|TR0|bring it to a vote this week will the 
20110118001700.000|20110118001703.000|TR0|rhetoric take a kinder, gentler, post- 
20110118001703.000|20110118001705.000|TR0|Tucson turn?

20110118001712.000|20110118001715.000|TR0|KING:  The new Republican House majority 
20110118001715.000|20110118001717.000|TR0|this week moves on its promise to repeal 
20110118001717.000|20110118001720.000|TR0|the Obama health care law.  And the 
20110118001720.000|20110118001722.000|TR0|president holds a critical U.S./China 
20110118001722.000|20110118001724.000|TR0|summit looking to press his Chinese 
20110118001724.000|20110118001727.000|TR0|counterpart on major economics, security, 
20110118001727.000|20110118001729.000|TR0|and human rights differences.  Let's 
20110118001729.000|20110118001732.000|TR0|discuss the big week ahead with our 
20110118001732.000|20110118001734.000|TR0|contributors James Carville, John Avlon 
20110118001734.000|20110118001736.000|TR0|and Ed Rollins.
20110118001736.000|20110118001739.000|TR0|
20110118001739.000|20110118001741.000|TR0|Mr. Rollins, to you first as the 
20110118001741.000|20110118001744.000|TR0|Republican in the group.  What is the 
20110118001744.000|20110118001746.000|TR0|burden on the new Republican majority when 
20110118001746.000|20110118001749.000|TR0|they bring health care to the floor?  I 
20110118001749.000|20110118001751.000|TR0|want to go back through this.  Officially, 
20110118001751.000|20110118001753.000|TR0|officially the legislation is called "the 
20110118001753.000|20110118001756.000|TR0|health -- the job-killing health care law 
20110118001756.000|20110118001758.000|TR0|act."  So when Leader Cantor put out the 
20110118001758.000|20110118001801.000|TR0|schedule today, that was on the posting.  
20110118001801.000|20110118001803.000|TR0|He -- I have the e-mail here somewhere.  
20110118001803.000|20110118001805.000|TR0|He put out the posting and that's what he 
20110118001805.000|20110118001808.000|TR0|calls it in this posting.  Should 
20110118001808.000|20110118001810.000|TR0|Republicans -- should Republicans just 
20110118001810.000|20110118001813.000|TR0|back away from that language post-Tucson 
20110118001813.000|20110118001815.000|TR0|or is that silly to ask them to do that?
20110118001815.000|20110118001818.000|TR0|
20110118001818.000|20110118001820.000|TR0|ED ROLLINS, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  
20110118001820.000|20110118001822.000|TR0|Well, it's the name on the bill at this 
20110118001822.000|20110118001825.000|TR0|point in time.  What they need to do is to 
20110118001825.000|20110118001827.000|TR0|make the arguments and many Republicans do 
20110118001827.000|20110118001830.000|TR0|feel that this health care will basically 
20110118001830.000|20110118001832.000|TR0|cost Americans jobs.  It will certainly 
20110118001832.000|20110118001834.000|TR0|cost them a lot more money.  I think at 
20110118001834.000|20110118001837.000|TR0|the end of the day the arguments have to 
20110118001837.000|20110118001839.000|TR0|be put forth in a way that the American 
20110118001839.000|20110118001842.000|TR0|public understands it.  Do it in a quiet 
20110118001842.000|20110118001844.000|TR0|effective way.  At the end of the day if 
20110118001844.000|20110118001846.000|TR0|you get the 218 votes, which I think they 
20110118001846.000|20110118001849.000|TR0|do, repeal it.  Don't make a lot of noise 
20110118001849.000|20110118001851.000|TR0|about it. Do it.  This is the beginning of 
20110118001851.000|20110118001854.000|TR0|a long process to change this law and make 
20110118001854.000|20110118001856.000|TR0|it more effective.
20110118001856.000|20110118001859.000|TR0|
20110118001859.000|20110118001901.000|TR0|KING:  John Avlon, Ed says do it in a 
20110118001901.000|20110118001903.000|TR0|quiet, effective way, if you have the 
20110118001903.000|20110118001906.000|TR0|votes just do it.  I want you to listen to 
20110118001906.000|20110118001908.000|TR0|some of the language before Tucson about 
20110118001908.000|20110118001911.000|TR0|this.  Let's listen to the language first.

20110118001920.000|20110118001923.000|TR0|That's why we're taking these first steps 
20110118001923.000|20110118001925.000|TR0|to repeal the job-killing health care law 
20110118001925.000|20110118001928.000|TR0|that was passed last year, over the 
20110118001928.000|20110118001930.000|TR0|objections of the American people.

20110118001932.000|20110118001935.000|TR0|REP. JOE WALSH (R), ILLINOIS:  This bill 
20110118001935.000|20110118001937.000|TR0|is a job-killer.
20110118001937.000|20110118001940.000|TR0|
20110118001940.000|20110118001942.000|TR0|REP. DARRELL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA:  As we 
20110118001942.000|20110118001944.000|TR0|go forward though we're going to be 
20110118001944.000|20110118001947.000|TR0|looking for job killers in regulatory 
20110118001947.000|20110118001949.000|TR0|excesses.

20110118001956.000|20110118001959.000|TR0|KING:  Is asking the question, can you get 
20110118001959.000|20110118002001.000|TR0|word of the word killers or killing, John 
20110118002001.000|20110118002004.000|TR0|Avlon, after Tucson, is that the right 
20110118002004.000|20110118002006.000|TR0|question to ask or are we overreacting?
20110118002006.000|20110118002009.000|TR0|
20110118002009.000|20110118002011.000|TR0|JOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  No, it's 
20110118002011.000|20110118002013.000|TR0|absolutely the right question to ask and 
20110118002013.000|20110118002016.000|TR0|they're stuck with that bumper sticker 
20110118002016.000|20110118002018.000|TR0|that was printed before Tucson.  But it's 
20110118002018.000|20110118002021.000|TR0|a fundamental evidence of the problem in 
20110118002021.000|20110118002023.000|TR0|American politics.  That kind of language 
20110118002023.000|20110118002025.000|TR0|should be on the ash heap along with the 
20110118002025.000|20110118002028.000|TR0|talk of Second Amendment remedies.  Our -- 
20110118002028.000|20110118002030.000|TR0|we should have principled political 
20110118002030.000|20110118002033.000|TR0|differences, principled political debates 
20110118002033.000|20110118002035.000|TR0|but this is not a war.  The rhetoric of 
20110118002035.000|20110118002038.000|TR0|violence is totally inappropriate.  And it 
20110118002038.000|20110118002040.000|TR0|looks stupid now but it was stupid then 
20110118002040.000|20110118002042.000|TR0|too, so we've got to stop this stuff.
20110118002042.000|20110118002045.000|TR0|
20110118002045.000|20110118002047.000|TR0|KING:  James Carville, you want to give 
20110118002047.000|20110118002050.000|TR0|the Republicans your advice?  What should 
20110118002050.000|20110118002052.000|TR0|they call it instead?
20110118002052.000|20110118002054.000|TR0|
20110118002054.000|20110118002057.000|TR0|JAMES CARVILLE, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: 
20110118002057.000|20110118002059.000|TR0| They've got a name for it and I think to 
20110118002059.000|20110118002102.000|TR0|try to go from job-killing to job-crushing 
20110118002102.000|20110118002104.000|TR0|just looks silly.  It just -- you know 
20110118002104.000|20110118002106.000|TR0|have the name and just don't use it 
20110118002106.000|20110118002109.000|TR0|anymore is probably the best thing to do.  
20110118002109.000|20110118002111.000|TR0|I would point out that the CBO says this 
20110118002111.000|20110118002114.000|TR0|will actually cut the deficit by $230 
20110118002114.000|20110118002116.000|TR0|billion.  And there was a bunch of 
20110118002116.000|20110118002119.000|TR0|articles today illustrating how Republican 
20110118002119.000|20110118002121.000|TR0|math on this is faulty.
20110118002121.000|20110118002123.000|TR0|
20110118002123.000|20110118002126.000|TR0|But that's a fair thing for the political 
20110118002126.000|20110118002128.000|TR0|discourse here.  But if they try to change 
20110118002128.000|20110118002131.000|TR0|it they'll just promote more discussion.  
20110118002131.000|20110118002133.000|TR0|Just leave the name of the bill the same 
20110118002133.000|20110118002135.000|TR0|and talk about it in a different manner is 
20110118002135.000|20110118002138.000|TR0|probably the best thing they can do.
20110118002138.000|20110118002140.000|TR0|
20110118002140.000|20110118002143.000|TR0|KING:  I want to change.  It's not just 
20110118002143.000|20110118002145.000|TR0|the House Republicans who have a huge and 
20110118002145.000|20110118002148.000|TR0|delicate challenge this week.  The 
20110118002148.000|20110118002150.000|TR0|president of the United States will be 
20110118002150.000|20110118002152.000|TR0|sitting for several days across the table 
20110118002152.000|20110118002155.000|TR0|from President Hu Jintao of China.  And 
20110118002155.000|20110118002157.000|TR0|this is -- this is the relationship that 
20110118002157.000|20110118002200.000|TR0|matters most.  Whether we're talking about 
20110118002200.000|20110118002202.000|TR0|the growth of China's military and 
20110118002202.000|20110118002204.000|TR0|security matters, when Secretary Gates was 
20110118002204.000|20110118002207.000|TR0|there, they tested a new stealth fighter.
20110118002207.000|20110118002209.000|TR0|
20110118002209.000|20110118002212.000|TR0|Whether we're talking about economic 
20110118002212.000|20110118002214.000|TR0|concerns and the fact that China has 
20110118002214.000|20110118002216.000|TR0|promised to deal with its currency but has 
20110118002216.000|20110118002219.000|TR0|not done that in a way that's satisfactory 
20110118002219.000|20110118002221.000|TR0|to the United States.  Other questions 
20110118002221.000|20110118002224.000|TR0|about American jobs and cheap Chinese 
20110118002224.000|20110118002226.000|TR0|goods and on the human rights issue. 
20110118002226.000|20110118002229.000|TR0|You'll have a president of the United 
20110118002229.000|20110118002231.000|TR0|States, himself a Nobel Prize winner, 
20110118002231.000|20110118002233.000|TR0|sitting across the table from a Chinese 
20110118002233.000|20110118002236.000|TR0|president who has a Nobel Laureate locked 
20110118002236.000|20110118002238.000|TR0|up in prison.  John Avlon, what does the 
20110118002238.000|20110118002241.000|TR0|president of the United States have to do 
20110118002241.000|20110118002243.000|TR0|here?  I assume part of the question here 
20110118002243.000|20110118002245.000|TR0|is proving he's being tough.
20110118002245.000|20110118002248.000|TR0|
20110118002248.000|20110118002250.000|TR0|AVLON:  Yes, and I think you've seen 
20110118002250.000|20110118002253.000|TR0|actually a shift in the administration's 
20110118002253.000|20110118002255.000|TR0|approach to China over the last several 
20110118002255.000|20110118002258.000|TR0|weeks. Secretary Gates' trip to China, 
20110118002258.000|20110118002300.000|TR0|speeches by Secretary of State Clinton and 
20110118002300.000|20110118002302.000|TR0|Timothy Geithner.  I think this 
20110118002302.000|20110118002305.000|TR0|administration has woken up to the fact 
20110118002305.000|20110118002307.000|TR0|that they need to view China as a 
20110118002307.000|20110118002310.000|TR0|strategic competitor and that simply 
20110118002310.000|20110118002312.000|TR0|trying to get along is not going to work.  
20110118002312.000|20110118002314.000|TR0|That they need to find a way to grow with 
20110118002314.000|20110118002317.000|TR0|China but they need to take a stronger 
20110118002317.000|20110118002319.000|TR0|line, whether it's on the economy or human 
20110118002319.000|20110118002322.000|TR0|rights in particular, that that's going to 
20110118002322.000|20110118002324.000|TR0|get the best results in the long run for 
20110118002324.000|20110118002326.000|TR0|the values that we care about around the 
20110118002326.000|20110118002329.000|TR0|world.
20110118002329.000|20110118002331.000|TR0|
20110118002331.000|20110118002334.000|TR0|KING:  But James, we need the trade 
20110118002334.000|20110118002336.000|TR0|relationship, do we not?  And there's also 
20110118002336.000|20110118002339.000|TR0|the fact that the Chinese happen to hold 
20110118002339.000|20110118002341.000|TR0|most of our debt.
20110118002341.000|20110118002343.000|TR0|
20110118002343.000|20110118002346.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  Right.  If anybody's ever had a 
20110118002346.000|20110118002348.000|TR0|discussion with that banker, you're not in 
20110118002348.000|20110118002351.000|TR0|the strongest possible position, I agree 
20110118002351.000|20110118002353.000|TR0|with what John said.  But we made a 
20110118002353.000|20110118002355.000|TR0|decision some -- you know seven, eight 
20110118002355.000|20110118002358.000|TR0|years ago that we were going to let them 
20110118002358.000|20110118002400.000|TR0|become our banker.  And that is coming 
20110118002400.000|20110118002403.000|TR0|back to haunt us.
20110118002403.000|20110118002405.000|TR0|
20110118002405.000|20110118002408.000|TR0|And for the foreseeable future, the 
20110118002408.000|20110118002410.000|TR0|relationship on a financial basis is not 
20110118002410.000|20110118002412.000|TR0|an even relationship.  And I think that 
20110118002412.000|20110118002415.000|TR0|was a bad choice we made when we decided 
20110118002415.000|20110118002417.000|TR0|to spend as much as we could and, you 
20110118002417.000|20110118002420.000|TR0|know, fund wars with tax cuts and you make 
20110118002420.000|20110118002422.000|TR0|somebody your banker and the Chinese 
20110118002422.000|20110118002424.000|TR0|stepped in and we're paying for the 
20110118002424.000|20110118002427.000|TR0|consequences of that.
20110118002427.000|20110118002429.000|TR0|
20110118002429.000|20110118002432.000|TR0|KING:  Ed Rollins, you were at Ronald

20110118002434.000|20110118002436.000|TR0|negotiations that led to the end of the 
20110118002436.000|20110118002439.000|TR0|Cold War. There are some who say it's not 
20110118002439.000|20110118002441.000|TR0|from a military standpoint obviously, at 
20110118002441.000|20110118002444.000|TR0|least yet, but right now that that's 
20110118002444.000|20110118002446.000|TR0|essentially where we could be headed, to a 
20110118002446.000|20110118002449.000|TR0|Cold War between these two giant economic 
20110118002449.000|20110118002451.000|TR0|and security powers.
20110118002451.000|20110118002453.000|TR0|
20110118002453.000|20110118002456.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  The critical thing here is 20 
20110118002456.000|20110118002458.000|TR0|years from now if China does nothing but 
20110118002458.000|20110118002501.000|TR0|continue to grow at the rate it is, it is 
20110118002501.000|20110118002503.000|TR0|the super power economically and what have 
20110118002503.000|20110118002505.000|TR0|you.  And it may be on its way to becoming 
20110118002505.000|20110118002508.000|TR0|a military.  I would argue very 
20110118002508.000|20110118002510.000|TR0|strenuously that there is potentially a 
20110118002510.000|20110118002513.000|TR0|strategic partner that's very important.
20110118002513.000|20110118002515.000|TR0|
20110118002515.000|20110118002518.000|TR0|And as important as language may be 
20110118002518.000|20110118002520.000|TR0|everywhere else, particularly with the 
20110118002520.000|20110118002522.000|TR0|Chinese, where face is so, so very 
20110118002522.000|20110118002525.000|TR0|important, that the words matter.  And if 
20110118002525.000|20110118002527.000|TR0|you want to jawbone them about certain 
20110118002527.000|20110118002530.000|TR0|things that are going on inside their 
20110118002530.000|20110118002532.000|TR0|country, when we have many things inside 
20110118002532.000|20110118002534.000|TR0|our country that are not perfect, it could 
20110118002534.000|20110118002537.000|TR0|have an impact.  And I think at the end of 
20110118002537.000|20110118002539.000|TR0|the day we want them to be -- you know 
20110118002539.000|20110118002542.000|TR0|with the Cold War you can say all you 
20110118002542.000|20110118002544.000|TR0|wanted to the Soviets, because they've 
20110118002544.000|20110118002546.000|TR0|said everything they wanted to, and we've 
20110118002546.000|20110118002549.000|TR0|been against each other for 40 years.  In 
20110118002549.000|20110118002551.000|TR0|this particular case there's some delicacy 
20110118002551.000|20110118002554.000|TR0|that needs to be for the reasons laid out 
20110118002554.000|20110118002556.000|TR0|by my two partners here, and I think it's 
20110118002556.000|20110118002559.000|TR0|just probably as important a meeting as 
20110118002559.000|20110118002601.000|TR0|we've had in a long, long time in this

20110118002615.000|20110118002618.000|TR0|KING:  I want to squeeze one more issue in 
20110118002618.000|20110118002620.000|TR0|before we go.  Often we talk politics here 
20110118002620.000|20110118002623.000|TR0|but the former Vice President Dick Cheney 
20110118002623.000|20110118002625.000|TR0|has just given a television interview to 
20110118002625.000|20110118002628.000|TR0|NBC News.  We haven't heard from him much. 
20110118002628.000|20110118002630.000|TR0| He's been at a few public events.  We 
20110118002630.000|20110118002632.000|TR0|haven't seen an interview with the former 
20110118002632.000|20110118002635.000|TR0|vice president.  In this interview with 
20110118002635.000|20110118002637.000|TR0|Jamie Gangel, he explains the device he 
20110118002637.000|20110118002640.000|TR0|now has essentially attached to his heart 
20110118002640.000|20110118002642.000|TR0|to keep him alive.  Let's listen.

20110118002649.000|20110118002652.000|TR0|DICK CHENEY, FORMER V.P. OF THE UNITED 
20110118002652.000|20110118002654.000|TR0|STATES:  I wear it on a vest and there's a 
20110118002654.000|20110118002656.000|TR0|control element here and then two 
20110118002656.000|20110118002659.000|TR0|batteries, one on each side.  Good for 
20110118002659.000|20110118002701.000|TR0|about 12 hours each.  And then there's a 
20110118002701.000|20110118002704.000|TR0|cord that runs inside my chest to the pump 
20110118002704.000|20110118002706.000|TR0|on the inside.  And that's what powers it 
20110118002706.000|20110118002709.000|TR0|and keeps it functioning.  Initially, 
20110118002709.000|20110118002711.000|TR0|obviously, it's kind of awkward to walk 
20110118002711.000|20110118002713.000|TR0|around with all this gear on.  But you 
20110118002713.000|20110118002716.000|TR0|quickly get to the point where you've 
20110118002716.000|20110118002718.000|TR0|adapted, where it's second nature to you.

20110118002730.000|20110118002733.000|TR0|tomorrow.  But what a delight -- Ed to you 
20110118002733.000|20110118002735.000|TR0|first, to see he's just sitting there 
20110118002735.000|20110118002738.000|TR0|whether matter of factorially (ph) well I 
20110118002738.000|20110118002740.000|TR0|got this thing plugged in here and the 
20110118002740.000|20110118002742.000|TR0|batteries go here.  Well that's what's 
20110118002742.000|20110118002745.000|TR0|keeping Dick Cheney alive.

20110118002747.000|20110118002750.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  Well it's the wonders of modern 
20110118002750.000|20110118002752.000|TR0|technology and health care.  And as all 
20110118002752.000|20110118002754.000|TR0|the debates we're having about cost and 
20110118002754.000|20110118002757.000|TR0|who should have what, I mean here's a man 
20110118002757.000|20110118002759.000|TR0|who obviously wouldn't still be alive if 
20110118002759.000|20110118002802.000|TR0|it wasn't for the technology and the 
20110118002802.000|20110118002804.000|TR0|advances and I think it's wonderful.  I 
20110118002804.000|20110118002806.000|TR0|still think he has contributions to make.  
20110118002806.000|20110118002809.000|TR0|Obviously different points of view than a 
20110118002809.000|20110118002811.000|TR0|lot of people.  But at the same time, he's 
20110118002811.000|20110118002814.000|TR0|there.  He's got a strong voice, a weak 
20110118002814.000|20110118002816.000|TR0|heart but a strong voice. And I'm all -- 
20110118002816.000|20110118002819.000|TR0|all the more power to him.

20110118002953.000|20110118002955.000|TR0|about the demographic challenge.  About 
20110118002955.000|20110118002957.000|TR0|half of Americans weren't alive when Dr. 
20110118002957.000|20110118003000.000|TR0|King was assassinated.  So how do we teach 
20110118003000.000|20110118003002.000|TR0|the lessons of the man and the movement to 
20110118003002.000|20110118003005.000|TR0|younger Americans who look up now and see

20110118003017.000|20110118003019.000|TR0|BIOGRAPHER:  I think that it's very hard 
20110118003019.000|20110118003022.000|TR0|to teach the reality and the great 
20110118003022.000|20110118003024.000|TR0|upheaval and progress from that era, 
20110118003024.000|20110118003026.000|TR0|especially because there are so many myths 
20110118003026.000|20110118003029.000|TR0|about it. People think it was only for 
20110118003029.000|20110118003031.000|TR0|black people or by or about black people, 
20110118003031.000|20110118003034.000|TR0|and in fact Dr. King himself defined it as 
20110118003034.000|20110118003036.000|TR0|a mission to redeem the soul of democracy. 
20110118003036.000|20110118003039.000|TR0| To establish freedom in a much broader 
20110118003039.000|20110118003041.000|TR0|sense.  And it was a great drama and it 
20110118003041.000|20110118003043.000|TR0|takes a lot of effort to try to get the 
20110118003043.000|20110118003046.000|TR0|reality of that to penetrate all the myths 
20110118003046.000|20110118003048.000|TR0|that we have now.
20110118003048.000|20110118003051.000|TR0|
20110118003051.000|20110118003053.000|TR0|KING:  And for you, before you were a 
20110118003053.000|20110118003055.000|TR0|historian, just as a young man, what 
20110118003055.000|20110118003058.000|TR0|captivated Taylor Branch about this drama? 
20110118003058.000|20110118003100.000|TR0| You were nine when the Montgomery boycott 
20110118003100.000|20110118003103.000|TR0|started, 13 when the sit-in protests, 14 
20110118003103.000|20110118003105.000|TR0|when the freedom riders staged their 
20110118003105.000|20110118003107.000|TR0|protests.  Why did Taylor Branch as a 
20110118003107.000|20110118003110.000|TR0|young man say, this is fascinating, I need 
20110118003110.000|20110118003112.000|TR0|to know more.
20110118003112.000|20110118003115.000|TR0|
20110118003115.000|20110118003117.000|TR0|BRANCH:  I did my best to avoid it because 
20110118003117.000|20110118003120.000|TR0|it was scary but finally it just wore me 
20110118003120.000|20110118003122.000|TR0|down.  Particularly to see small children, 
20110118003122.000|20110118003124.000|TR0|much younger than I was, marching to jail 
20110118003124.000|20110118003127.000|TR0|singing freedom songs, little girls in 
20110118003127.000|20110118003129.000|TR0|Birmingham.  And it finally broke down my 
20110118003129.000|20110118003132.000|TR0|resistance to know where this was coming 
20110118003132.000|20110118003134.000|TR0|from, because it was both scary and 
20110118003134.000|20110118003136.000|TR0|stirring.  And what I later -- the longer 
20110118003136.000|20110118003139.000|TR0|I studied it the more I realized it was 
20110118003139.000|20110118003141.000|TR0|fundamentally American, fundamentally 
20110118003141.000|20110118003144.000|TR0|patriotic, and that people were really 
20110118003144.000|20110118003146.000|TR0|wrestling with the essence of what it 
20110118003146.000|20110118003149.000|TR0|means to be an American.
20110118003149.000|20110118003151.000|TR0|
20110118003151.000|20110118003153.000|TR0|KING:  You talk in your books and your 
20110118003153.000|20110118003156.000|TR0|interviews about the myths, the great 
20110118003156.000|20110118003158.000|TR0|myths about not only about the movement 
20110118003158.000|20110118003201.000|TR0|but specifically about Dr. King.  What's 
20110118003201.000|20110118003203.000|TR0|the greatest myth about Martin Luther King?
20110118003203.000|20110118003205.000|TR0|
20110118003205.000|20110118003208.000|TR0|BRANCH:  That he was just a simple 
20110118003208.000|20110118003210.000|TR0|preacher who got carried away with turn 
20110118003210.000|20110118003213.000|TR0|the other cheek.  He was -- instead, he 
20110118003213.000|20110118003215.000|TR0|was a man of great ecumenical vision, who 
20110118003215.000|20110118003217.000|TR0|understood and gave his life for what it 
20110118003217.000|20110118003220.000|TR0|really means to be an American, which is 
20110118003220.000|20110118003222.000|TR0|to be -- to build public trust and be 
20110118003222.000|20110118003225.000|TR0|involved as a citizen and believe that 
20110118003225.000|20110118003227.000|TR0|your country can accomplish impossible 
20110118003227.000|20110118003230.000|TR0|things.  And we really need that again 
20110118003230.000|20110118003232.000|TR0|today.
20110118003232.000|20110118003234.000|TR0|
20110118003234.000|20110118003237.000|TR0|KING:  We ask often somewhat silly 
20110118003237.000|20110118003239.000|TR0|hypothetical questions.  What would Dr.  
20110118003239.000|20110118003242.000|TR0|King think if he saw this?  What would Dr. 
20110118003242.000|20110118003244.000|TR0|King think if he saw that?  I want to ask 
20110118003244.000|20110118003246.000|TR0|you one based on the history you know 
20110118003246.000|20110118003249.000|TR0|quite well.  It was then young Marion 
20110118003249.000|20110118003251.000|TR0|Wright who talked to Dr. King back in the 
20110118003251.000|20110118003254.000|TR0|day about the poverty project, the 
20110118003254.000|20110118003256.000|TR0|people's project, and Marion Wright 
20110118003256.000|20110118003259.000|TR0|Edelman's children defense fund has a new 
20110118003259.000|20110118003301.000|TR0|study out this just week on the state of 
20110118003301.000|20110118003303.000|TR0|black America.
20110118003303.000|20110118003306.000|TR0|
20110118003306.000|20110118003308.000|TR0|Black children are three times as likely 
20110118003308.000|20110118003311.000|TR0|to be poor as white children.  Fewer than 
20110118003311.000|20110118003313.000|TR0|40 percent of all black children live with 
20110118003313.000|20110118003315.000|TR0|two parents.  Four times as likely as 
20110118003315.000|20110118003318.000|TR0|whites to be in foster care.  Seven times 
20110118003318.000|20110118003320.000|TR0|as likely as white children to have a 
20110118003320.000|20110118003323.000|TR0|parent in prison.  What would Dr. King 
20110118003323.000|20110118003325.000|TR0|think if he saw the state of black America 
20110118003325.000|20110118003327.000|TR0|today?
20110118003327.000|20110118003330.000|TR0|
20110118003330.000|20110118003332.000|TR0|BRANCH:  Well I think there are many 
20110118003332.000|20110118003335.000|TR0|things that he would be dismayed by.  That 
20110118003335.000|20110118003337.000|TR0|and the state of violence.  He would 
20110118003337.000|20110118003340.000|TR0|probably say just what he did then, which 
20110118003340.000|20110118003342.000|TR0|is that the condition of black Americans 
20110118003342.000|20110118003344.000|TR0|is not a taillight but a headlight for 
20110118003344.000|20110118003347.000|TR0|where all of America is going in 
20110118003347.000|20110118003349.000|TR0|educational systems and the erosion of a 
20110118003349.000|20110118003352.000|TR0|lot of primary industries that causes this 
20110118003352.000|20110118003354.000|TR0|poverty.  And that we should all take an 
20110118003354.000|20110118003356.000|TR0|alarm from it and try to get engaged in 
20110118003356.000|20110118003359.000|TR0|what to do about it.
20110118003359.000|20110118003401.000|TR0|
20110118003401.000|20110118003404.000|TR0|KING:  We also conduct polling this week.  
20110118003404.000|20110118003406.000|TR0|Has the United States fulfilled Martin 
20110118003406.000|20110118003409.000|TR0|Luther King's vision?  Americans are 
20110118003409.000|20110118003411.000|TR0|denied -- divided on it, 48 percent say 
20110118003411.000|20110118003413.000|TR0|yes, 49 percent say no.  What's 
20110118003413.000|20110118003416.000|TR0|interesting is 23 percent say no and never 
20110118003416.000|20110118003418.000|TR0|will.  Why the skepticism or maybe it's 
20110118003418.000|20110118003421.000|TR0|opposition?
20110118003421.000|20110118003423.000|TR0|
20110118003423.000|20110118003425.000|TR0|BRANCH:  Well I -- we live in a pretty 
20110118003425.000|20110118003428.000|TR0|cynical time when a lot of people don't 
20110118003428.000|20110118003430.000|TR0|believe that anything is possible in 
20110118003430.000|20110118003433.000|TR0|public affairs.  And that the government 
20110118003433.000|20110118003435.000|TR0|is surely an object of entertainment.  
20110118003435.000|20110118003437.000|TR0|We'd be better off if it folded.  So 
20110118003437.000|20110118003440.000|TR0|that's not surprising.  Nor is it 
20110118003440.000|20110118003442.000|TR0|surprising I think that a lot of people 
20110118003442.000|20110118003445.000|TR0|are divided, because we have made enormous 
20110118003445.000|20110118003447.000|TR0|progress that would amaze Dr. King.
20110118003447.000|20110118003450.000|TR0|
20110118003450.000|20110118003452.000|TR0|The conditions of the middle class -- I 
20110118003452.000|20110118003454.000|TR0|mean after all, a year after he died, the 
20110118003454.000|20110118003457.000|TR0|University of Texas won the national 
20110118003457.000|20110118003459.000|TR0|football championship with a team that 
20110118003459.000|20110118003502.000|TR0|didn't have a single black player. These 
20110118003502.000|20110118003504.000|TR0|things are unimaginable today.  We've made 
20110118003504.000|20110118003506.000|TR0|great progress for women, for black 
20110118003506.000|20110118003509.000|TR0|people, and everything else.  But we've 
20110118003509.000|20110118003511.000|TR0|gone backwards on a lot of poverty.  We've 
20110118003511.000|20110118003514.000|TR0|gone backwards in violence.  And we've 
20110118003514.000|20110118003516.000|TR0|gone backwards, above all, in an erosion 
20110118003516.000|20110118003519.000|TR0|of public optimism about what America can 
20110118003519.000|20110118003521.000|TR0|accomplish.

20110118003523.000|20110118003526.000|TR0|KING:  Later this year, assuming all goes 
20110118003526.000|20110118003528.000|TR0|according to the current schedule, we will 
20110118003528.000|20110118003531.000|TR0|dedicate the MLK Memorial more than 40 
20110118003531.000|20110118003533.000|TR0|years after he was killed.  Why did it 
20110118003533.000|20110118003535.000|TR0|take so long and what do you think of that 
20110118003535.000|20110118003538.000|TR0|project?
20110118003538.000|20110118003540.000|TR0|
20110118003540.000|20110118003543.000|TR0|BRANCH:  Well, all these projects tend to 
20110118003543.000|20110118003545.000|TR0|take a long time.  I mean, goodness 
20110118003545.000|20110118003547.000|TR0|gracious, the Washington Monument didn't 
20110118003547.000|20110118003550.000|TR0|get up until 1880; got interrupted by the 
20110118003550.000|20110118003552.000|TR0|civil war.  Many decades after Washington, 
20110118003552.000|20110118003555.000|TR0|so these things take awhile.  And I think 
20110118003555.000|20110118003557.000|TR0|it's good to try to commemorate him.  
20110118003557.000|20110118003600.000|TR0|We're also in the midst of creating a

20110118003602.000|20110118003604.000|TR0|History and Culture on The Mall.  Right

20110118003619.000|20110118003621.000|TR0|part and parcel of the essence of what it

20110118003657.000|20110118003700.000|TR0|Doctor Martin Luther King's assassination, 
20110118003700.000|20110118003702.000|TR0|today is the 25th year King's birthday has 
20110118003702.000|20110118003705.000|TR0|been a federal holiday.  But has his dream 
20110118003705.000|20110118003707.000|TR0|been fulfilled?
20110118003707.000|20110118003710.000|TR0|
20110118003710.000|20110118003712.000|TR0|For perspective I'm joined by the Atlanta 
20110118003712.000|20110118003714.000|TR0|Mayor Kasim Reed.
20110118003714.000|20110118003717.000|TR0|
20110118003717.000|20110118003719.000|TR0|Mr. Mayor, I want to start with this 
20110118003719.000|20110118003722.000|TR0|generational question.  I also asked the 
20110118003722.000|20110118003724.000|TR0|King biographer Taylor Branch.  How do you 
20110118003724.000|20110118003726.000|TR0|teach young Americans -- I'm going to 
20110118003726.000|20110118003729.000|TR0|include you in this group-those not alive, 
20110118003729.000|20110118003731.000|TR0|or just born, when Doctor King was 
20110118003731.000|20110118003734.000|TR0|assassinated.  They're growing up in a 
20110118003734.000|20110118003736.000|TR0|country with an African-American 
20110118003736.000|20110118003739.000|TR0|president.  How do you teach them about 
20110118003739.000|20110118003741.000|TR0|the man and the movement and the struggle?
20110118003741.000|20110118003743.000|TR0|
20110118003743.000|20110118003746.000|TR0|MAYOR KASIM REED, (D) ATLANTA:  Well, you 
20110118003746.000|20110118003748.000|TR0|do it like taking advantage of moments 
20110118003748.000|20110118003751.000|TR0|like today.  The 25th anniversary is a 
20110118003751.000|20110118003753.000|TR0|part of it.  You've really got to do it 
20110118003753.000|20110118003755.000|TR0|every day and make it a story that is a 
20110118003755.000|20110118003758.000|TR0|part of the American character.  I 
20110118003758.000|20110118003800.000|TR0|actually believe that, as I talked about 
20110118003800.000|20110118003803.000|TR0|in the speech today, that we have to use 
20110118003803.000|20110118003805.000|TR0|all of the technology available so that 
20110118003805.000|20110118003807.000|TR0|young people are comfortable getting it in 
20110118003807.000|20110118003810.000|TR0|whatever form that's comfortable for them. 
20110118003810.000|20110118003812.000|TR0| So whether that's on their iPad, on their 
20110118003812.000|20110118003815.000|TR0|iPhone, through Google or e-mail, we have 
20110118003815.000|20110118003817.000|TR0|to make it available in the formats that 
20110118003817.000|20110118003820.000|TR0|young people are used to dealing with 
20110118003820.000|20110118003822.000|TR0|right now.
20110118003822.000|20110118003824.000|TR0|
20110118003824.000|20110118003827.000|TR0|KING:  And Doctor King's church is in your 
20110118003827.000|20110118003829.000|TR0|city.  The King Center is in your city.  
20110118003829.000|20110118003832.000|TR0|What would Doctor King think today if he 
20110118003832.000|20110118003834.000|TR0|were walking the streets of Atlanta and 
20110118003834.000|20110118003836.000|TR0|seeing the city of paradox? There's 
20110118003836.000|20110118003839.000|TR0|African-American political power but you 
20110118003839.000|20110118003841.000|TR0|have the largest concentration of black 
20110118003841.000|20110118003844.000|TR0|millionaires, yet one of the largest rates 
20110118003844.000|20110118003846.000|TR0|of African-American poverty.
20110118003846.000|20110118003849.000|TR0|
20110118003849.000|20110118003851.000|TR0|REED:  Well, I think that he would know 
20110118003851.000|20110118003853.000|TR0|that we have work to do. We're actually 
20110118003853.000|20110118003856.000|TR0|very fortunate in Atlanta because we have 
20110118003856.000|20110118003858.000|TR0|so many of the heroes and she-roes from 
20110118003858.000|20110118003901.000|TR0|the movement.  He'd say we have work to 
20110118003901.000|20110118003903.000|TR0|do.  Now is the time to take maximum 
20110118003903.000|20110118003905.000|TR0|advantage of Kingian values.  He would be 
20110118003905.000|20110118003908.000|TR0|talking about improving access to health 
20110118003908.000|20110118003910.000|TR0|care.  I think he would want us to take 
20110118003910.000|20110118003913.000|TR0|much more radical approaches as it relates 
20110118003913.000|20110118003915.000|TR0|to preparing young people in the 
20110118003915.000|20110118003917.000|TR0|educational system.  I don't think he 
20110118003917.000|20110118003920.000|TR0|would be satisfied, we're not satisfied.  
20110118003920.000|20110118003922.000|TR0|I think he would want us to reach out to 
20110118003922.000|20110118003925.000|TR0|rural America, and not just be confined to 
20110118003925.000|20110118003927.000|TR0|urban America.
20110118003927.000|20110118003930.000|TR0|
20110118003930.000|20110118003932.000|TR0|Right now, I think the country and the 
20110118003932.000|20110118003934.000|TR0|city and states are in a position where 
20110118003934.000|20110118003937.000|TR0|there can be no weak links in the chain.  
20110118003937.000|20110118003939.000|TR0|So we've really got to be exploiting all 
20110118003939.000|20110118003942.000|TR0|of the human potential that's available 
20110118003942.000|20110118003944.000|TR0|right now.  In terms of Latinos and 
20110118003944.000|20110118003946.000|TR0|African-Americans and rural folks; and 
20110118003946.000|20110118003949.000|TR0|making sure that they become full 
20110118003949.000|20110118003951.000|TR0|contributors to the American dream.  And I 
20110118003951.000|20110118003954.000|TR0|think they would take advantage of the 
20110118003954.000|20110118003956.000|TR0|challenges we have right now and force us 
20110118003956.000|20110118003959.000|TR0|to push much harder than we're doing.
20110118003959.000|20110118004001.000|TR0|
20110118004001.000|20110118004003.000|TR0|We're also not talking about poor people 
20110118004003.000|20110118004006.000|TR0|enough.  If you listen to the national 
20110118004006.000|20110118004008.000|TR0|conversation right now, it's generally a 
20110118004008.000|20110118004011.000|TR0|conversation among the super wealthy, the 
20110118004011.000|20110118004013.000|TR0|wealthy, and the middle class.  And poor 
20110118004013.000|20110118004015.000|TR0|people are being left out, in my judgment, 
20110118004015.000|20110118004018.000|TR0|to the challenge and -- to the challenge 
20110118004018.000|20110118004020.000|TR0|of the nation.  I think we've got to focus 
20110118004020.000|20110118004023.000|TR0|on poor people more.  And acknowledge the 
20110118004023.000|20110118004025.000|TR0|fact that we have to provide the 
20110118004025.000|20110118004027.000|TR0|opportunities and focus in the areas of 
20110118004027.000|20110118004030.000|TR0|education and housing and investment in 
20110118004030.000|20110118004032.000|TR0|that community to bring them along as well.
20110118004032.000|20110118004035.000|TR0|
20110118004035.000|20110118004037.000|TR0|KING:  And to what degree, Sir, then does 
20110118004037.000|20110118004040.000|TR0|our first African- American president 
20110118004040.000|20110118004042.000|TR0|share in the responsibility, in your view, 
20110118004042.000|20110118004044.000|TR0|for focusing more attention on the poor, 
20110118004044.000|20110118004047.000|TR0|more attention to the problems of the 
20110118004047.000|20110118004049.000|TR0|inner city?  You know this better than I 
20110118004049.000|20110118004052.000|TR0|do.  There's no question President Obama's 
20110118004052.000|20110118004054.000|TR0|popularity in the African-American 
20110118004054.000|20110118004056.000|TR0|community is still significant.  But when 
20110118004056.000|20110118004059.000|TR0|you go into some urban pockets where you 
20110118004059.000|20110118004101.000|TR0|have the education problems and the jobs 
20110118004101.000|20110118004104.000|TR0|problem, in some cases crime problems, you 
20110118004104.000|20110118004106.000|TR0|do pick up a bit of-resentment's not the 
20110118004106.000|20110118004109.000|TR0|right word-but a little bit of, why 
20110118004109.000|20110118004111.000|TR0|doesn't he spend more time talking about 
20110118004111.000|20110118004113.000|TR0|us?  Is that fair?
20110118004113.000|20110118004116.000|TR0|
20110118004116.000|20110118004118.000|TR0|REED:  I think that's fair, but I think 
20110118004118.000|20110118004121.000|TR0|that in the African- American community, 
20110118004121.000|20110118004123.000|TR0|and in other communities, we understand 
20110118004123.000|20110118004125.000|TR0|that the most important thing that 
20110118004125.000|20110118004128.000|TR0|President Obama can do for us is to be 
20110118004128.000|20110118004130.000|TR0|successful as president of all of the 
20110118004130.000|20110118004133.000|TR0|United States of America.  I actually take 
20110118004133.000|20110118004135.000|TR0|it up as my obligation to do a better job 
20110118004135.000|20110118004137.000|TR0|of explaining and focusing on the 
20110118004137.000|20110118004140.000|TR0|challenges that we have in cities and in 
20110118004140.000|20110118004142.000|TR0|towns. That's why in Atlanta, we're doing 
20110118004142.000|20110118004145.000|TR0|things like moving forward with a Mayor's 
20110118004145.000|20110118004147.000|TR0|Youth Program.  To make sure when our kids 
20110118004147.000|20110118004150.000|TR0|graduate from high school they're able to 
20110118004150.000|20110118004152.000|TR0|go on to college.  We are helping fund 
20110118004152.000|20110118004154.000|TR0|that in this city.
20110118004154.000|20110118004157.000|TR0|
20110118004157.000|20110118004159.000|TR0|We just reopened every single recreation 
20110118004159.000|20110118004202.000|TR0|in the city of Atlanta. They've been 
20110118004202.000|20110118004204.000|TR0|closed for two years.  It was creating a 
20110118004204.000|20110118004206.000|TR0|massive gap between the time that our 
20110118004206.000|20110118004209.000|TR0|young people got out of high school at the 
20110118004209.000|20110118004211.000|TR0|end of the day, and that critical three to 
20110118004211.000|20110118004214.000|TR0|four hours when their parents and folks 
20110118004214.000|20110118004216.000|TR0|weren't home.  We opened our rec centers 
20110118004216.000|20110118004219.000|TR0|till 8:00 at night.
20110118004219.000|20110118004221.000|TR0|
20110118004221.000|20110118004223.000|TR0|Rather than criticizing the president, 
20110118004223.000|20110118004226.000|TR0|we've got to take responsibility in 
20110118004226.000|20110118004228.000|TR0|offices where we are, and that's what I 
20110118004228.000|20110118004231.000|TR0|intend to do.  Not to pass the buck, but 
20110118004231.000|20110118004233.000|TR0|listen to the challenges that you present 
20110118004233.000|20110118004235.000|TR0|in your questions, and do something about 
20110118004235.000|20110118004238.000|TR0|them.  We have African-Americans in 
20110118004238.000|20110118004240.000|TR0|offices across the United States of 
20110118004240.000|20110118004243.000|TR0|America. It's really time for my 
20110118004243.000|20110118004245.000|TR0|generation to be accountable for the 
20110118004245.000|20110118004247.000|TR0|problems that we have.  Working in 
20110118004247.000|20110118004250.000|TR0|partnership with the federal government, 
20110118004250.000|20110118004252.000|TR0|this needs to be a no-excuses time.
20110118004252.000|20110118004255.000|TR0|
20110118004255.000|20110118004257.000|TR0|KING:  I want to get your observation then 
20110118004257.000|20110118004300.000|TR0|on this.  You mentioned a no-excuses time. 
20110118004300.000|20110118004302.000|TR0| On this day I was searching around, what 
20110118004302.000|20110118004304.000|TR0|is the commentary, what are people saying, 
20110118004304.000|20110118004307.000|TR0|how are they reflecting on Doctor  King, 
20110118004307.000|20110118004309.000|TR0|on his legacy, on the civil rights 
20110118004309.000|20110118004312.000|TR0|movement, on the state of black America 
20110118004312.000|20110118004314.000|TR0|today.
20110118004314.000|20110118004316.000|TR0|
20110118004316.000|20110118004319.000|TR0|Michael Reagan, son of former president 
20110118004319.000|20110118004321.000|TR0|Reagan, wrote this on FOXNews.com today.  
20110118004321.000|20110118004324.000|TR0|I'd love your reaction.  He says, quote, 
20110118004324.000|20110118004326.000|TR0|"Ronald Reagan was a far better friend to 
20110118004326.000|20110118004329.000|TR0|black Americans than Barack Obama has 
20110118004329.000|20110118004331.000|TR0|been.  Just compare the Reagan and Obama 
20110118004331.000|20110118004333.000|TR0|records.  Under Obama, black unemployment 
20110118004333.000|20110118004336.000|TR0|rose from 12.6 percent in January 2009 to 
20110118004336.000|20110118004338.000|TR0|16 percent today.  This means the black 
20110118004338.000|20110118004341.000|TR0|unemployment has increased by more than 
20110118004341.000|20110118004343.000|TR0|one-fourth since Obama took office."
20110118004343.000|20110118004345.000|TR0|
20110118004345.000|20110118004348.000|TR0|Ronald Reagan, a better friend to black 
20110118004348.000|20110118004350.000|TR0|America than Barack Obama, Sir?
20110118004350.000|20110118004353.000|TR0|
20110118004353.000|20110118004355.000|TR0|REED:  I wouldn't say that that's the case 
20110118004355.000|20110118004357.000|TR0|at all, because it ignores the previous 
20110118004357.000|20110118004400.000|TR0|eight to 10 years that we have had our 
20110118004400.000|20110118004402.000|TR0|Republican leadership that candidly was 
20110118004402.000|20110118004405.000|TR0|not focused on the African-American or 
20110118004405.000|20110118004407.000|TR0|minority communities.  So you had eight to 
20110118004407.000|20110118004410.000|TR0|10 years where you had massive deficits 
20110118004410.000|20110118004412.000|TR0|and the president had a Herculean task.  
20110118004412.000|20110118004414.000|TR0|He had to save the automobile industry.  
20110118004414.000|20110118004417.000|TR0|He had to pass health care so more people 
20110118004417.000|20110118004419.000|TR0|of color and all working people could have 
20110118004419.000|20110118004422.000|TR0|greater access to health care.  He had to 
20110118004422.000|20110118004424.000|TR0|deal with the financial crisis that was 
20110118004424.000|20110118004426.000|TR0|unprecedented.
20110118004426.000|20110118004429.000|TR0|
20110118004429.000|20110118004431.000|TR0|So if you look at the challenges that 
20110118004431.000|20110118004434.000|TR0|Barack Obama had, the notion that he has 
20110118004434.000|20110118004436.000|TR0|somehow not paid attention to the 
20110118004436.000|20110118004439.000|TR0|African-American community, after eight to 
20110118004439.000|20110118004441.000|TR0|10 years of neglect, I think is wrong- 
20110118004441.000|20110118004443.000|TR0|minded.
20110118004443.000|20110118004446.000|TR0|
20110118004446.000|20110118004448.000|TR0|But I also think we need to have a new 
20110118004448.000|20110118004451.000|TR0|conversation.  The success of the 
20110118004451.000|20110118004453.000|TR0|African-American community, the success of 
20110118004453.000|20110118004455.000|TR0|the Latino community, and the success of 
20110118004455.000|20110118004458.000|TR0|rural America, needs to be framed in a 
20110118004458.000|20110118004500.000|TR0|different way instead of the same old 
20110118004500.000|20110118004503.000|TR0|paradigm.  It needs to be framed from the 
20110118004503.000|20110118004505.000|TR0|standpoint of what we have to do to make 
20110118004505.000|20110118004507.000|TR0|sure the United States of America is 
20110118004507.000|20110118004510.000|TR0|strong.  There was a time where we could 
20110118004510.000|20110118004512.000|TR0|actually afford racism in America.  Those 
20110118004512.000|20110118004515.000|TR0|days are past.  Because of the rise of 
20110118004515.000|20110118004517.000|TR0|China and the rise of India, we can no 
20110118004517.000|20110118004520.000|TR0|longer afford to be racist, or to exclude 
20110118004520.000|20110118004522.000|TR0|large cadres of our population from being 
20110118004522.000|20110118004524.000|TR0|well-trained and prepared to compete.  So 
20110118004524.000|20110118004527.000|TR0|rather than to get bogged down in talking 
20110118004527.000|20110118004529.000|TR0|about the old gripes and petty concerns, 
20110118004529.000|20110118004532.000|TR0|we need to acknowledge the fact that you 
20110118004532.000|20110118004534.000|TR0|can't have large populations of black 
20110118004534.000|20110118004536.000|TR0|people and Latino people and rural people 
20110118004536.000|20110118004539.000|TR0|who are not equipped to compete on the 
20110118004539.000|20110118004541.000|TR0|world stage.  The United States can't 
20110118004541.000|20110118004544.000|TR0|carry that burden anymore.
20110118004544.000|20110118004546.000|TR0|
20110118004546.000|20110118004549.000|TR0|So if you love America and are committed 
20110118004549.000|20110118004551.000|TR0|to making sure that America is as strong 
20110118004551.000|20110118004553.000|TR0|as it can be, we've got to have a new 
20110118004553.000|20110118004556.000|TR0|conversation about excellence among all 
20110118004556.000|20110118004558.000|TR0|our people and about making the critical 
20110118004558.000|20110118004601.000|TR0|investments among the working poor and 
20110118004601.000|20110118004603.000|TR0|people of color. And I think that is the 
20110118004603.000|20110118004605.000|TR0|conversation that's going to move the 
20110118004605.000|20110118004608.000|TR0|country in a more progressive direction 
20110118004608.000|20110118004610.000|TR0|instead of playing the old games.

20110118004646.000|20110118004649.000|TR0|KING:  Welcome back.  Lisa Sylvester's 
20110118004649.000|20110118004651.000|TR0|with us with the latest news you need to 
20110118004651.000|20110118004654.000|TR0|know right now.

20110118004656.000|20110118004659.000|TR0|(NEWSBREAK)      LISA SYLVESTER, CNN NEWS 
20110118004659.000|20110118004701.000|TR0|ANCHOR:  Finally, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs 
20110118004701.000|20110118004703.000|TR0|is taking a leave of absence to deal with 
20110118004703.000|20110118004706.000|TR0|an undisclosed medical issue.
20110118004706.000|20110118004708.000|TR0|
20110118004708.000|20110118004711.000|TR0|KING:  One of the big questions about that 
20110118004711.000|20110118004713.000|TR0|is, will it somehow slow product 
20110118004713.000|20110118004715.000|TR0|development?  Or will it cause any ripple 
20110118004715.000|20110118004718.000|TR0|in the company's value?
20110118004718.000|20110118004720.000|TR0|
20110118004720.000|20110118004723.000|TR0|Lisa, hang tight a second, I want to show, 
20110118004723.000|20110118004725.000|TR0|the past when Steve Jobs has taken medical 
20110118004725.000|20110118004727.000|TR0|leave or whether he looked like he lost a 
20110118004727.000|20110118004730.000|TR0|lot of weight it has had an impact.  Let's 
20110118004730.000|20110118004732.000|TR0|take a peak at this.  As we this out right 
20110118004732.000|20110118004735.000|TR0|now.  Apple and Microsoft stock values, 
20110118004735.000|20110118004737.000|TR0|2001 to 2011, essentially over the last 10 
20110118004737.000|20110118004740.000|TR0|years.  Look they are sort of roughly the 
20110118004740.000|20110118004742.000|TR0|same.  Microsoft is the blue line.  This 
20110118004742.000|20110118004744.000|TR0|is Apple up here.  So why these spikes?  
20110118004744.000|20110118004747.000|TR0|If you look at the spikes, way back here, 
20110118004747.000|20110118004749.000|TR0|2004 is when Steve Jobs first said he had 
20110118004749.000|20110118004752.000|TR0|pancreatic cancer.  You see the stock 
20110118004752.000|20110118004754.000|TR0|comes up.  He demonstrates the iPhone for 
20110118004754.000|20110118004756.000|TR0|the first time in 2007, up we go.
20110118004756.000|20110118004759.000|TR0|
20110118004759.000|20110118004801.000|TR0|Look at the dip here, 2008, he appeared 
20110118004801.000|20110118004804.000|TR0|dramatically thinner. There was a lot of 
20110118004804.000|20110118004806.000|TR0|speculation about, that the stock value 
20110118004806.000|20110118004809.000|TR0|dropped a little bit, came back up.  He 
20110118004809.000|20110118004811.000|TR0|did take a medical leave in 2009, from 
20110118004811.000|20110118004813.000|TR0|January to June, stock went back down a 
20110118004813.000|20110118004816.000|TR0|little bit.  Then, you've seen Apple since 
20110118004816.000|20110118004818.000|TR0|then, wow, going up, going up, 
20110118004818.000|20110118004821.000|TR0|demonstrating the iPad. The question is 
20110118004821.000|20110118004823.000|TR0|what happens now?
20110118004823.000|20110118004825.000|TR0|
20110118004825.000|20110118004828.000|TR0|Again, Steve Jobs is still the CEO.  He 
20110118004828.000|20110118004830.000|TR0|says he hopes to be back soon.  But we 
20110118004830.000|20110118004833.000|TR0|need to keep an eye on that.  That's one 
20110118004833.000|20110118004835.000|TR0|thing to watch here.  Here's another big 
20110118004835.000|20110118004837.000|TR0|thing to watch here.  This has been the 
20110118004837.000|20110118004840.000|TR0|prediction, essentially the analysts' 
20110118004840.000|20110118004842.000|TR0|projection.  Here is Apple stock now, just 
20110118004842.000|20110118004845.000|TR0|under $350.  The median projection it will 
20110118004845.000|20110118004847.000|TR0|get around $400 a share.  Some people 
20110118004847.000|20110118004850.000|TR0|think it could go as high as $450, others 
20110118004850.000|20110118004852.000|TR0|think it might drop to $349.
20110118004852.000|20110118004854.000|TR0|
20110118004854.000|20110118004857.000|TR0|So, Lisa, one of the big questions you ask 
20110118004857.000|20110118004859.000|TR0|now is with Steve Jobs out for a little 
20110118004859.000|20110118004902.000|TR0|bit does it cause a little anxiety, jump 
20110118004902.000|20110118004904.000|TR0|in the market?
20110118004904.000|20110118004906.000|TR0|
20110118004906.000|20110118004909.000|TR0|SYLVESTER:  Yes, and you know, this is 
20110118004909.000|20110118004911.000|TR0|such a crucial time right now.  You've got 
20110118004911.000|20110118004914.000|TR0|the iPad 2 they're supposed to be 
20110118004914.000|20110118004916.000|TR0|unveiling.  They just had the announcement 
20110118004916.000|20110118004919.000|TR0|Verizon's going to be a carrier with the 
20110118004919.000|20110118004921.000|TR0|iPhone.  So much going on right now and 
20110118004921.000|20110118004923.000|TR0|just the timing is really lousy for the 
20110118004923.000|20110118004926.000|TR0|company.
20110118004926.000|20110118004928.000|TR0|
20110118004928.000|20110118004931.000|TR0|KING:  Which is why they announced it I'm 
20110118004931.000|20110118004933.000|TR0|sure on a day the markets are closed so we 
20110118004933.000|20110118004935.000|TR0|could all digest.
20110118004935.000|20110118004938.000|TR0|
20110118004938.000|20110118004940.000|TR0|Lisa, thanks for being here.
20110118004940.000|20110118004943.000|TR0|
20110118004943.000|20110118004945.000|TR0|When we come back, who's got a question 
20110118004945.000|20110118004947.000|TR0|for Piers Morgan?  I've got a few.  He'll 
20110118004947.000|20110118004950.000|TR0|be with us on the other side.

20110118004957.000|20110118005000.000|TR0|KING:  This guy is pretty lucky.  He's had 
20110118005000.000|20110118005002.000|TR0|weeks of promos. There has even been a 
20110118005002.000|20110118005004.000|TR0|countdown clock on CNN today.  We're just 
20110118005004.000|20110118005007.000|TR0|a little more than hour away from the 
20110118005007.000|20110118005009.000|TR0|debut of "PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT"
20110118005009.000|20110118005012.000|TR0|
20110118005012.000|20110118005014.000|TR0|Piers is lucky, we're lucky to have you 
20110118005014.000|20110118005016.000|TR0|with us.  You're lucky to be here but 
20110118005016.000|20110118005019.000|TR0|we're lucky to have you with us tonight.

20110118005021.000|20110118005024.000|TR0|I just want to ask you, there's been a 
20110118005024.000|20110118005026.000|TR0|great buildup about this. Are you a bit 
20110118005026.000|20110118005029.000|TR0|nervous?  You are launching this new 
20110118005029.000|20110118005031.000|TR0|program.  And you've been a talent judge.  
20110118005031.000|20110118005033.000|TR0|What will the first line of the review be 
20110118005033.000|20110118005036.000|TR0|tomorrow morning?
20110118005036.000|20110118005038.000|TR0|
20110118005038.000|20110118005041.000|TR0|PIERS MORGAN, CNN ANCHOR, PIERS MORGAN 
20110118005041.000|20110118005043.000|TR0|TONIGHT:  I think it will be brilliant.  
20110118005043.000|20110118005045.000|TR0|John, it will be the first word.  At 
20110118005045.000|20110118005048.000|TR0|least, I hope it will.  It will be if I 
20110118005048.000|20110118005050.000|TR0|write it.
20110118005050.000|20110118005053.000|TR0|
20110118005053.000|20110118005055.000|TR0|No, I think it's been a hell of a buildup. 
20110118005055.000|20110118005057.000|TR0| Yeah, I'm a little bit tense.  It would 
20110118005057.000|20110118005100.000|TR0|be inhuman not to be.  We're one hour away 
20110118005100.000|20110118005102.000|TR0|from the end of a kind of iconic reign of 
20110118005102.000|20110118005105.000|TR0|Larry King.  I suppose you must be quite 
20110118005105.000|20110118005107.000|TR0|happy because you're the only King left on 
20110118005107.000|20110118005110.000|TR0|CNN in prime time.
20110118005110.000|20110118005112.000|TR0|
20110118005112.000|20110118005114.000|TR0|KING:  There can only be one monarch.
20110118005114.000|20110118005117.000|TR0|
20110118005117.000|20110118005119.000|TR0|MORGAN:  It has worked quite well for you. 
20110118005119.000|20110118005122.000|TR0| I think I'm cautiously optimistic and 
20110118005122.000|20110118005124.000|TR0|excited above all else.
20110118005124.000|20110118005126.000|TR0|
20110118005126.000|20110118005129.000|TR0|KING:  You had these promos.  The one I'm 
20110118005129.000|20110118005131.000|TR0|struck by as you pull on your cufflinks, 
20110118005131.000|20110118005134.000|TR0|you say you'll be a little dangerous.  
20110118005134.000|20110118005136.000|TR0|Isn't that sort of like, sort of pregnant?
20110118005136.000|20110118005139.000|TR0|
20110118005139.000|20110118005141.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I meant that I'm unpredictable.  
20110118005141.000|20110118005143.000|TR0|You're not quite sure what's going to 
20110118005143.000|20110118005146.000|TR0|happen.  You'll see flashes of that 
20110118005146.000|20110118005148.000|TR0|tonight with Oprah.  You'll definitely see 
20110118005148.000|20110118005151.000|TR0|it tomorrow night with Howard Stern and 
20110118005151.000|20110118005153.000|TR0|even more significantly you'll guaranteed 
20110118005153.000|20110118005155.000|TR0|see it on Thursday when my guest is Ricky 
20110118005155.000|20110118005158.000|TR0|Gervais, with the first interview since 
20110118005158.000|20110118005200.000|TR0|the Golden Globes.  So, that is what I 
20110118005200.000|20110118005203.000|TR0|mean by dangerous.  I think when you get 
20110118005203.000|20110118005205.000|TR0|guests like that on, anything can happen.
20110118005205.000|20110118005207.000|TR0|
20110118005207.000|20110118005210.000|TR0|KING:  Let's get to that.  I want to get 
20110118005210.000|20110118005212.000|TR0|to Oprah, but let's do Ricky Gervais 
20110118005212.000|20110118005215.000|TR0|first.  I want you to listen first to a 
20110118005215.000|20110118005217.000|TR0|little bit of his commentary last night 
20110118005217.000|20110118005220.000|TR0|that left people in Hollywood a tad upset.

20110118005227.000|20110118005229.000|TR0|RICKY GERVAIS, HOST, GOLDEN GLOBES:  It's 
20110118005229.000|20110118005232.000|TR0|going to be a night of partying and heavy 
20110118005232.000|20110118005234.000|TR0|drinking.  Or as Charlie Sheen calls it, 
20110118005234.000|20110118005236.000|TR0|breakfast.

20110118005241.000|20110118005244.000|TR0|talented, and Jewish, apparently.  Mel 
20110118005244.000|20110118005246.000|TR0|Gibson told me that.  He's obsessed.  
20110118005246.000|20110118005249.000|TR0|Please welcome Ashton Kutcher's dad, Bruce 
20110118005249.000|20110118005251.000|TR0|Willis.
20110118005251.000|20110118005253.000|TR0|
20110118005253.000|20110118005256.000|TR0|Many of you this room probably know him 
20110118005256.000|20110118005258.000|TR0|best from such facilities at the Betty

20110118005310.000|20110118005313.000|TR0|KING:  And so this is a great get.  You 
20110118005313.000|20110118005315.000|TR0|get the first interview. Hollywood is 
20110118005315.000|20110118005317.000|TR0|saying how dare this guy come into our 
20110118005317.000|20110118005320.000|TR0|backyard and say such rude things.  What 
20110118005320.000|20110118005322.000|TR0|are you going to do in that interview?
20110118005322.000|20110118005325.000|TR0|
20110118005325.000|20110118005327.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Probably just going to 
20110118005327.000|20110118005330.000|TR0|congratulate him.  I sort of point out 
20110118005330.000|20110118005332.000|TR0|that if you invite a hammerhead shark to 
20110118005332.000|20110118005334.000|TR0|dinner then you can hardly complain when 
20110118005334.000|20110118005337.000|TR0|he starts to eat all the other guests.
20110118005337.000|20110118005339.000|TR0|
20110118005339.000|20110118005342.000|TR0|KING:  Now, are you worried you'll be 
20110118005342.000|20110118005344.000|TR0|sitting across -- you're a Brit.  He's a 
20110118005344.000|20110118005346.000|TR0|Brit.  That the Americans will think, oh, 
20110118005346.000|20110118005349.000|TR0|sure, who are you to cast judgment on us?  
20110118005349.000|20110118005351.000|TR0|Especially those Hollywood people?
20110118005351.000|20110118005354.000|TR0|
20110118005354.000|20110118005356.000|TR0|MORGAN:  I can bring an interesting 
20110118005356.000|20110118005359.000|TR0|perspective.  Ricky Gervais to a British 
20110118005359.000|20110118005401.000|TR0|ear last night was howling funny.  But our 
20110118005401.000|20110118005403.000|TR0|humor is bent toward sarcasm and talking 
20110118005403.000|20110118005406.000|TR0|each other down.  The American celebrity 
20110118005406.000|20110118005408.000|TR0|world, as I have encountered in the last 
20110118005408.000|20110118005411.000|TR0|few years, isn't quite like that.  They 
20110118005411.000|20110118005413.000|TR0|like to go to award ceremonies and slap 
20110118005413.000|20110118005415.000|TR0|each other's backs and tell each other how 
20110118005415.000|20110118005418.000|TR0|wonderful they are.  Well, I don't really 
20110118005418.000|20110118005420.000|TR0|subscribe to that.  I prefer the rather 
20110118005420.000|20110118005423.000|TR0|more brutal roasting that someone like 
20110118005423.000|20110118005425.000|TR0|Ricky gives them.
20110118005425.000|20110118005427.000|TR0|
20110118005427.000|20110118005430.000|TR0|Some who realize, he's kidding.  He 
20110118005430.000|20110118005432.000|TR0|doesn't really think half of this stuff.  
20110118005432.000|20110118005435.000|TR0|He just finds it funny.  And I love the 
20110118005435.000|20110118005437.000|TR0|fact that it's dangerous.  I watched it 
20110118005437.000|20110118005440.000|TR0|with tears rolling down my cheeks knowing 
20110118005440.000|20110118005442.000|TR0|that half the room would find it very 
20110118005442.000|20110118005444.000|TR0|funny and the other half would have a 
20110118005444.000|20110118005447.000|TR0|terrible sense of humor failures.

20110118005449.000|20110118005452.000|TR0|KING:  Your first guest is that woman, 
20110118005452.000|20110118005454.000|TR0|Oprah.  We all know her. She's known 
20110118005454.000|20110118005456.000|TR0|around the world.  I want to play one 
20110118005456.000|20110118005459.000|TR0|little a segment here, where you talking

20110118005509.000|20110118005511.000|TR0|OPRAH WINFREY, OPRAH WINFREY NETWORK:  I 
20110118005511.000|20110118005513.000|TR0|had been betrayed by someone in my family 
20110118005513.000|20110118005516.000|TR0|who had gone to the tabloids and for 
20110118005516.000|20110118005518.000|TR0|$20,000 had sold me out.  And Steadman

20110118005521.000|20110118005523.000|TR0|We knew it was coming out.  He came into

20110118005525.000|20110118005528.000|TR0|said the story is out.  I have a copy of 
20110118005528.000|20110118005530.000|TR0|it if you want to see it.  I'm really 
20110118005530.000|20110118005533.000|TR0|sorry.  You don't deserve this.  It was 
20110118005533.000|20110118005535.000|TR0|that moment.
20110118005535.000|20110118005537.000|TR0|
20110118005537.000|20110118005540.000|TR0|MORGAN:  You looked at him and thought you 
20110118005540.000|20110118005542.000|TR0|love this man?
20110118005542.000|20110118005545.000|TR0|
20110118005545.000|20110118005547.000|TR0|WINFREY:  No, I looked at him and thought 
20110118005547.000|20110118005550.000|TR0|here's something who is willing to stand 
20110118005550.000|20110118005552.000|TR0|in and stand up for you.  And that's what 
20110118005552.000|20110118005554.000|TR0|love is.
20110118005554.000|20110118005557.000|TR0|
20110118005557.000|20110118005559.000|TR0|(END VIDEO CLIP)
20110118005559.000|20110118005602.000|TR0|
20110118005602.000|20110118005604.000|TR0|KING:  Interesting answer because you 
20110118005604.000|20110118005606.000|TR0|asked you looked at him and you thought I 
20110118005606.000|20110118005609.000|TR0|love this man.  No.  There's a twist on 
20110118005609.000|20110118005611.000|TR0|her definition there.
20110118005611.000|20110118005614.000|TR0|
20110118005614.000|20110118005616.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Oprah is always careful about how 
20110118005616.000|20110118005619.000|TR0|she answers the questions in the 
20110118005619.000|20110118005621.000|TR0|interview.  At the same time she's very 
20110118005621.000|20110118005623.000|TR0|revealing. The question that prompted that 
20110118005623.000|20110118005626.000|TR0|whole exchange was when did you first 
20110118005626.000|20110118005628.000|TR0|realize you loved Steadman, and that was 
20110118005628.000|20110118005631.000|TR0|her way of answering.  You know, it is an 
20110118005631.000|20110118005633.000|TR0|interesting insight.  There's been so much 
20110118005633.000|20110118005635.000|TR0|speculation about the relationship she has 
20110118005635.000|20110118005638.000|TR0|with Steadman.  But certainly she went out 
20110118005638.000|20110118005640.000|TR0|of her way in the interview tonight, I 
20110118005640.000|20110118005643.000|TR0|think, to really make it very clear that 
20110118005643.000|20110118005645.000|TR0|it's a real relationship.  He's been there 
20110118005645.000|20110118005647.000|TR0|for nearly 20 years, in her life.  
20110118005647.000|20110118005650.000|TR0|Although they don't want to get married, 
20110118005650.000|20110118005652.000|TR0|they are (AUDIO GAP) a real sense that it 
20110118005652.000|20110118005655.000|TR0|was important to her, in this interview, 
20110118005655.000|20110118005657.000|TR0|to make that clear.
20110118005657.000|20110118005700.000|TR0|
20110118005700.000|20110118005702.000|TR0|KING:  Piers Morgan, we appreciate your

20110118005712.000|20110118005714.000|TR0|MORGAN:  John, thank you so much.  You'll 
20110118005714.000|20110118005716.000|TR0|always be the King to me, you know that.
20110118005716.000|20110118005719.000|TR0|
20110118005719.000|20110118005721.000|TR0|KING:  I like that.  I like that quite a 
20110118005721.000|20110118005724.000|TR0|bit.  Piers, have a great night and great 
20110118005724.000|20110118005726.000|TR0|week.  Welcome aboard, my friend.
20110118005726.000|20110118005729.000|TR0|
20110118005729.000|20110118005731.000|TR0|MORGAN:  Thank you.
20110118005731.000|20110118005733.000|TR0|
20110118005733.000|20110118005736.000|TR0|KING:  There is much more to say on this 
20110118005736.000|20110118005738.000|TR0|Ricky Gervais controversy and who better 
20110118005738.000|20110118005741.000|TR0|to ask than our own resident comic?  Pete 
20110118005741.000|20110118005743.000|TR0|Dominick, he's got a few thoughts.  He's 
20110118005743.000|20110118005745.000|TR0|next.
20110118005745.000|20110118005748.000|TR0|
20110118005748.000|20110118005750.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20110118005750.000|20110118005753.000|TR0|
20110118005753.000|20110118005755.000|TR0|KING:  What do comedians think of the 
20110118005755.000|20110118005757.000|TR0|controversy over Ricky Gervais' comments 
20110118005757.000|20110118005800.000|TR0|on last night's Golden Globes?  Well, we 
20110118005800.000|20110118005802.000|TR0|have one of the best in the business.  Our 
20110118005802.000|20110118005805.000|TR0|funny man, Pete Dominick-Pete.
20110118005805.000|20110118005807.000|TR0|
20110118005807.000|20110118005810.000|TR0|PETE DOMINICK, CNN OFFBEAT REPORTER:  
20110118005810.000|20110118005812.000|TR0|Thank you very much, John King.
20110118005812.000|20110118005814.000|TR0|
20110118005814.000|20110118005817.000|TR0|Of course, we think Ricky Gervais, and I 
20110118005817.000|20110118005819.000|TR0|speak for all comedians who take risks, 
20110118005819.000|20110118005822.000|TR0|who push the envelope, who write and write 
20110118005822.000|20110118005824.000|TR0|originally, we all think he did a 
20110118005824.000|20110118005826.000|TR0|phenomenal job.  Some how in America we 
20110118005826.000|20110118005829.000|TR0|worship actors and actresses and athletes 
20110118005829.000|20110118005831.000|TR0|and somehow they are a sacred cow that we 
20110118005831.000|20110118005834.000|TR0|can't make fun of it.  Forget about it.
20110118005834.000|20110118005836.000|TR0|
20110118005836.000|20110118005839.000|TR0|I don't feel bad for anybody who got a 
20110118005839.000|20110118005841.000|TR0|little bit of a roast last at an award 
20110118005841.000|20110118005843.000|TR0|show.  I congratulate and applaud Ricky 
20110118005843.000|20110118005846.000|TR0|Gervais.  I look forward to seeing Piers' 
20110118005846.000|20110118005848.000|TR0|new show.  I liking Piers all the more for 
20110118005848.000|20110118005851.000|TR0|his opinion and looking forward to seeing 
20110118005851.000|20110118005853.000|TR0|that interview later this week.
20110118005853.000|20110118005855.000|TR0|

20110118005903.000|20110118005905.000|TR0|open it up.  Open it up.
20110118005905.000|20110118005907.000|TR0|
20110118005907.000|20110118005910.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Go ahead and say it.
20110118005910.000|20110118005912.000|TR0|

20110118005927.000|20110118005929.000|TR0|KING:  I still believe my guys are the 
20110118005929.000|20110118005932.000|TR0|better team, but on Sunday your guys were 
20110118005932.000|20110118005934.000|TR0|the better team.  They deserve that win.
20110118005934.000|20110118005936.000|TR0|
20110118005936.000|20110118005939.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  You are a class act.
20110118005939.000|20110118005941.000|TR0|
