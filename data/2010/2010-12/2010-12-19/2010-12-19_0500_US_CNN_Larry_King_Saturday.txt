20101219051202.889|20101219051204.057|CC1|HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.
20101219051204.190|20101219051206.559|CC1|IN MOST ANCIENT SOCIETIES,
20101219051206.693|20101219051207.527|CC1|PEOPLE DIDN'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH
20101219051207.660|20101219051208.695|CC1|TO GET CANCER.
20101219051208.828|20101219051211.965|CC1|IF CANCER EXISTED, IT REMAINED
20101219051212.098|20101219051214.534|CC1|SUBMERGED UNDER THE SEA OF OTHER
20101219051214.667|20101219051215.602|CC1|ILLNESSES.
20101219051215.735|20101219051217.871|CC1|CANCER'S EMERGENCE OF THE WORLD
20101219051218.004|20101219051219.172|CC1|BECOMES COMMON ONLY WHEN ALL
20101219051219.305|20101219051222.976|CC1|OTHER KILLERS THEMSELVES HAVE
20101219051223.109|20101219051223.810|CC1|BEEN KILLED.

20101219051229.015|20101219051230.884|CC1|CANCER, CAUSED BY MODERN LIFE,
20101219051231.017|20101219051233.019|CC1|WHICH SOMEHOW INCITED
20101219051233.153|20101219051234.521|CC1|PATHOLOGICAL GROWTH IN THE BODY.
20101219051234.654|20101219051235.655|CC1|THE LINK WAS CORRECT.
20101219051235.789|20101219051237.991|CC1|THE CASUALTY WAS NOT.
20101219051238.124|20101219051239.993|CC1|CIVILIZATION DIDN'T CAUSE
20101219051240.126|20101219051240.326|CC1|CANCER.
20101219051240.460|20101219051243.196|CC1|BUT BY EXTENDING HUMAN LIFE
20101219051243.329|20101219051246.900|CC1|SPANS, CIVILIZATION UNVEILED IT.
20101219051247.033|20101219051250.937|CC1|WHY, DR. MUKHERJEE, DID WE HIDE
20101219051251.070|20101219051251.704|CC1|IT SO LONG?
20101219051251.838|20101219051253.306|CC1|WHY DIDN'T WE SAY THE WORD?
20101219051253.440|20101219051255.442|CC1|>> PART OF THE ANSWER IS CANCER
20101219051255.575|20101219051257.210|CC1|IS AN AGE RELATED DISEASE.
20101219051257.343|20101219051259.579|CC1|MANY CANCERS ARE AGE RELATED,
20101219051259.712|20101219051301.214|CC1|BREAST CANCER IMPORTANTLY.
20101219051301.347|20101219051302.182|CC1|PROSTATE CANCER.
20101219051302.315|20101219051305.251|CC1|AND SO AS THE POPULATION AGES,
20101219051305.385|20101219051309.255|CC1|IN GENERAL, THE RATES OF CANCER
20101219051309.389|20101219051310.557|CC1|INCIDENCE WILL INCREASE.
20101219051310.690|20101219051312.258|CC1|THAT SAID, FOR A LONG TIME, THE
20101219051312.392|20101219051314.894|CC1|WORD CANCER WAS NOT EVEN UTTERED
20101219051315.028|20101219051316.563|CC1|IN THE PUBLIC REALM.
20101219051316.696|20101219051317.230|CC1|THERE WAS THE BIG C, IT WAS
20101219051317.363|20101219051320.166|CC1|HIDDEN.
20101219051320.300|20101219051322.135|CC1|A WOMAN CALLED UP "THE NEW YORK
20101219051322.268|20101219051324.637|CC1|TIMES" AND WANTED TO PLACE AN
20101219051324.771|20101219051326.106|CC1|ADVERTISEMENT FOR BREAST CANCER.
20101219051326.239|20101219051329.275|CC1|AND THEY SAID WHAT IF YOU PLACE
20101219051329.409|20101219051330.243|CC1|AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR DISEASE OF
20101219051330.377|20101219051334.013|CC1|THE CHEST WALL.
20101219051334.147|20101219051335.081|CC1|WE'RE JUST NOW TALKING ABOUT
20101219051335.215|20101219051337.250|CC1|THIS IN A PUBLIC WAY.
20101219051337.384|20101219051338.418|CC1|>> Larry: RICHARD NIXON DECLARED
20101219051338.551|20101219051339.285|CC1|WAR ON IT.
20101219051339.419|20101219051340.253|CC1|WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE WAR?
20101219051340.387|20101219051341.988|CC1|>> WE'VE HAD A WAR, LARRY.
20101219051342.122|20101219051342.856|CC1|>> Larry: BUT IT WAS LATE,
20101219051342.989|20101219051343.957|CC1|WASN'T IT?
20101219051344.090|20101219051346.593|CC1|>> WELL, WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS
20101219051346.726|20101219051346.960|CC1|PROGRESS.
20101219051347.093|20101219051348.695|CC1|YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS
20101219051348.828|20101219051351.564|CC1|VERY OPTIMISTICALLY.
20101219051351.698|20101219051353.400|CC1|NOT -- MORE THAN 12 MILLION
20101219051353.533|20101219051354.667|CC1|PEOPLE IN AMERICA, TENS OF
20101219051354.801|20101219051355.802|CC1|MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD ARE
20101219051355.935|20101219051356.736|CC1|LIVING NORMAL LIVES.
20101219051356.870|20101219051359.239|CC1|I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER TO BE WITH
20101219051359.372|20101219051401.941|CC1|YOU HERE TODAY, LARRY, 17 YEARS
20101219051402.075|20101219051403.877|CC1|AFTER I WAS DIAGNOSED WHEN THEY
20101219051404.010|20101219051404.978|CC1|GAVE ME 12 MONTHS TO LIVE.
20101219051405.111|20101219051407.480|CC1|I THINK WE UNDERESTIMATE, AS
20101219051407.614|20101219051408.982|CC1|PEOPLE SEE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
20101219051409.115|20101219051411.418|CC1|LIVING NORMAL, SUCCESSFUL LIVES,
20101219051411.551|20101219051413.687|CC1|CANCER NO LONGER IS A WORD THAT
20101219051413.820|20101219051416.122|CC1|IS NOT SPOKEN FROM THAT
20101219051416.256|20101219051416.723|CC1|STANDPOINT.
20101219051416.856|20101219051419.859|CC1|AND WE SOMETIMES FORGET THAT THE
20101219051419.993|20101219051421.461|CC1|GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT, THE
20101219051421.594|20101219051423.029|CC1|GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF THE 20th
20101219051423.163|20101219051424.631|CC1|CENTURY WAS A DOUBLING, A
20101219051424.764|20101219051426.366|CC1|DOUBLING OF LE EXPECTANCY ON
20101219051426.499|20101219051429.469|CC1|THIS PLANET IN 100 YEARS.
20101219051429.602|20101219051432.972|CC1|ONE OUT OF FIVE AMERICANS LOST
20101219051433.106|20101219051434.474|CC1|THEIR LIFE BEFORE 5 YEARS OLD.
20101219051434.607|20101219051435.642|CC1|SO 20% OF THE POPULATION DIDN'T
20101219051435.775|20101219051437.677|CC1|MAKE IT TO 5.
20101219051437.811|20101219051440.880|CC1|TODAY YOU GO TO 62 BEFORE 20% OF
20101219051441.014|20101219051442.749|CC1|THE POPULATION PASSES AWAY.
20101219051442.882|20101219051444.951|CC1|AND SO YES, WE'RE LIVING LONGER.
20101219051445.085|20101219051446.586|CC1|CANCER IS MORE COMMON.
20101219051446.720|20101219051448.588|CC1|ONE IN TWO MEN, ONE IN THREE
20101219051448.722|20101219051448.888|CC1|WOMEN.
20101219051449.022|20101219051452.525|CC1|BUT AS WE FOCUSED OUR ATTENTION
20101219051452.659|20101219051454.160|CC1|AND MODERN TECHNOLOGY ON CANCER,
20101219051454.294|20101219051455.996|CC1|THE DEATH RATE FROM PROSTATE
20101219051456.129|20101219051457.797|CC1|CANCER FROM PROJECTED LEVELS HAS
20101219051457.931|20101219051459.966|CC1|NOW DROPPED ALMOST 50%.
20101219051500.100|20101219051502.969|CC1|>> Larry: HOW MUCH DO THE
20101219051503.103|20101219051503.436|CC1|PHARMACEUTICALS?
20101219051503.570|20101219051506.406|CC1|>> IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE
20101219051506.539|20101219051508.308|CC1|DEATH RATE FROM CANCER IN THE
20101219051508.441|20101219051510.810|CC1|LAST 50 YEARS, IT HASN'T CHANGED
20101219051510.944|20101219051511.711|CC1|A LOT.
20101219051511.845|20101219051514.080|CC1|BUT I THINK MIKE IS A PERFECT
20101219051514.214|20101219051515.382|CC1|EXAMPLE OF HOW DIET AND
20101219051515.515|20101219051517.183|CC1|LIFESTYLE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
20101219051517.317|20101219051518.652|CC1|17 YEARS AGO WHEN WE TALKED
20101219051518.785|20101219051520.620|CC1|ABOUT THESE THINGS, HE HAS BEEN
20101219051520.754|20101219051521.755|CC1|MAKING --
20101219051521.888|20101219051523.056|CC1|>> Larry: NO MEDICATIONS HELPED
20101219051523.189|20101219051523.556|CC1|HIM?
20101219051523.690|20101219051526.092|CC1|>> I THINK MEDICATIONS -- IT'S
20101219051526.226|20101219051527.494|CC1|NOT ONE OR THE OTHER, IT'S A
20101219051527.627|20101219051528.295|CC1|COMBINATION OF THE TWO.
20101219051528.428|20101219051533.199|CC1|WE DID A STUDY WITH THE CHAIR OF
20101219051533.333|20101219051534.267|CC1|AT THE CANCER CENTER.
20101219051534.401|20101219051537.337|CC1|WE WORKED WITH MEN WHO HAD
20101219051537.470|20101219051539.673|CC1|BIOPSY DRIVEN PROSTATE CANCER
20101219051539.806|20101219051543.777|CC1|WHO SELECTED NOT TO HAVE
20101219051543.910|20101219051545.345|CC1|TRADITIONAL TREATMENT.
20101219051545.478|20101219051547.013|CC1|THE SIMPLE LIFESTYLE CHANGES
20101219051547.147|20101219051549.416|CC1|COULD STOP OR REVERSE THE
20101219051549.549|20101219051550.283|CC1|PROGRESSION IN MANY MEN.
20101219051550.417|20101219051551.985|CC1|>> IT'S THE SAME LIFESTYLE THAT
20101219051552.118|20101219051553.920|CC1|CAN ALSO REVERSE HEART DISEASE,
20101219051554.054|20101219051555.689|CC1|MANY OF THE SAME UNDERLYING
20101219051555.822|20101219051556.756|CC1|MECHANISMS, LIKE INFLAMMATION
20101219051556.890|20101219051559.726|CC1|ARE THE SAME IN BOTH CONDITIONS.
20101219051559.859|20101219051603.396|CC1|>> Larry: DR. RAGHAVAN, IS
20101219051603.530|20101219051606.633|CC1|CANCER A CIVIL WAR IN THE BODY,
20101219051606.766|20101219051609.536|CC1|IN WHICH CELLS GO TO WAR WITH
20101219051609.669|20101219051610.904|CC1|OTHER CELLS?
20101219051611.037|20101219051613.139|CC1|>> YOU KNOW, I GUESS THAT'S ONE
20101219051613.273|20101219051614.207|CC1|WAY OF EXPRESSING IT.
20101219051614.341|20101219051616.676|CC1|I THINK OF IT A LITTLE BIT
20101219051616.810|20101219051617.644|CC1|DIFFERENTLY.
20101219051617.777|20101219051618.979|CC1|IT'S CERTAINLY A BATTLE WHERE
20101219051619.112|20101219051620.714|CC1|THE BODY IS TRYING TO DEFEND
20101219051620.847|20101219051621.047|CC1|ITSELF.
20101219051621.181|20101219051624.217|CC1|IF YOU THINK OF THE GREAT
20101219051624.351|20101219051626.353|CC1|AUSTRALIAN IMMUNOLOGIST MANY
20101219051626.486|20101219051630.524|CC1|YEARS AGO WHO WAS INTERESTED IN
20101219051630.657|20101219051631.424|CC1|TRANSPLANTATION, HE SAID WHEN
20101219051631.558|20101219051633.627|CC1|YOU SUP PRELS THE IMMUNITY OF
20101219051633.760|20101219051636.663|CC1|THE BODY BY DOING A TRANSPLANT,
20101219051636.796|20101219051638.064|CC1|CANCER CELLS COULD GET TOTALLY
20101219051638.198|20101219051638.765|CC1|OUT OF CONTROL.
20101219051638.899|20101219051640.667|CC1|I KIND OF THINK OF CANCER MORE
20101219051640.800|20101219051642.903|CC1|AS AN INVADER THAT'S IN THE
20101219051643.036|20101219051645.272|CC1|BODY, SO THAT AS I THINK MANY
20101219051645.405|20101219051647.607|CC1|PEOPLE KNOW, WE'VE COME TO
20101219051647.741|20101219051648.742|CC1|UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE
20101219051648.875|20101219051650.610|CC1|DIFFERENT GENES THAT CONTROL THE
20101219051650.744|20101219051652.078|CC1|WAY CANCER CELLS GROW.
20101219051652.212|20101219051654.414|CC1|AND SOME OF THOSE GENES MUTATE,
20101219051654.548|20101219051657.517|CC1|SO THAT THE CELLS BECOME ALMOST
20101219051657.651|20101219051657.984|CC1|UNRECOGNIZABLE.
20101219051658.118|20101219051659.152|CC1|SO ESSENTIALLY YOU'VE KIND OF
20101219051659.286|20101219051700.787|CC1|GOT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE GOOD
20101219051700.921|20101219051702.389|CC1|GUYS, THE CAVALRY, WHICH IS THE
20101219051702.522|20101219051704.291|CC1|BODY'S DEFENSE SYSTEM FIGHTING
20101219051704.424|20101219051706.560|CC1|THE INVADERS.
20101219051706.693|20101219051708.662|CC1|AND AS DEAN ORNISH SAID A MINUTE

20101219052849.764|20101219052851.600|CC1|THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF
20101219052851.733|20101219052853.401|CC1|EDUCATED GUESSWORK, USING GOOD
20101219052853.535|20101219052855.837|CC1|CLINICAL SKILL AND A BIT OF
20101219052855.971|20101219052856.204|CC1|GUESSING.
20101219052856.338|20101219052858.073|CC1|NOW AS WE'VE DISCUSSED, WE'RE
20101219052858.206|20101219052900.509|CC1|STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THE GENES
20101219052900.642|20101219052905.413|CC1|THAT CONTROL CANCER, SOME
20101219052905.547|20101219052906.114|CC1|COLLEAGUES OF MINE FINISHED A
20101219052906.248|20101219052908.316|CC1|TRIAL USING CHEMOTHERAPY WAS
20101219052908.450|20101219052909.384|CC1|COMPLETELY PREDICATED ON A
20101219052909.518|20101219052911.887|CC1|MUTATION IN A GENE CALLED P-53,
20101219052912.020|20101219052915.557|CC1|WHICH IS ONE OF THE GENES THAT
20101219052915.690|20101219052917.292|CC1|SUPPRESSES ONE OF THE TYPES OF
20101219052917.425|20101219052917.626|CC1|CANCER.
20101219052917.759|20101219052919.995|CC1|I WILL MAKE THE COMMENT, BECAUSE
20101219052920.128|20101219052921.596|CC1|I, LIKE SEVERAL OF THE OTHERS,
20101219052921.730|20101219052922.931|CC1|AM VERY UP ON THE FACT THAT
20101219052923.064|20101219052925.600|CC1|WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS, THAT IT'S
20101219052925.734|20101219052927.803|CC1|A SLOW STEADY SLOG.
20101219052927.936|20101219052929.271|CC1|BUT I STILL THERE'S A PROBLEM.
20101219052929.404|20101219052931.873|CC1|THAT IS, WE HAVE AN IMMENSE
20101219052932.007|20101219052933.575|CC1|DISPARITY IN THE UNITED STATES,
20101219052933.708|20101219052935.410|CC1|AND IN NORTH AMERICA GENERALLY,
20101219052935.544|20101219052937.112|CC1|WHERE THERE ARE POPULATIONS OF
20101219052937.245|20101219052938.814|CC1|PATIENTS THAT JUST DON'T GET AN
20101219052938.947|20101219052939.347|CC1|EVEN BREAK.
20101219052939.481|20101219052941.550|CC1|PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY, THE
20101219052941.683|20101219052943.752|CC1|POOR, PEOPLE WHO ARE

20101219052947.589|20101219052950.258|CC1|AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME, IF I
20101219052950.392|20101219052952.461|CC1|WERE THE EMPEROR IN CONTROL OF
20101219052952.594|20101219052954.429|CC1|THINGS AND COULD DO ONE THING
20101219052954.563|20101219052956.465|CC1|THAT MIGHT REDUCE DEATH FROM
20101219052956.598|20101219052958.934|CC1|CANCER, IF I COULD MAGICALLY
20101219052959.067|20101219053000.235|CC1|CREATE A SITUATION WHERE THE
20101219053000.369|20101219053002.771|CC1|DEATH RATE FROM CANCER ACROSS
20101219053002.904|20101219053005.774|CC1|AMERICA WAS THE DEATH RATE FOR

20101219053007.709|20101219053009.044|CC1|WE'D DROP THE NATIONAL DEATH

20101219053013.015|20101219053014.583|CC1|>> YEAH, THAT'S A FASCINATING
20101219053014.716|20101219053015.717|CC1|WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.
20101219053015.851|20101219053017.986|CC1|YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING, WE
20101219053018.120|20101219053020.122|CC1|JUST DID A STORY SPECIFICALLY
20101219053020.255|20101219053022.491|CC1|LOOKING AT THE ELDERLY.
20101219053022.624|20101219053024.159|CC1|AND WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT
20101219053024.293|20101219053026.361|CC1|SO MANY TIMES HOSPITALS, HEALTH
20101219053026.495|20101219053027.996|CC1|CARE PROFESSIONALS, I THINK WITH

20101219053035.003|20101219053036.705|CC1|TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE THOUGHT
20101219053036.838|20101219053037.739|CC1|TOO BE TOO OLD.
20101219053037.873|20101219053039.408|CC1|EVEN IF THEIR BODIES CAN BE
20101219053039.541|20101219053040.008|CC1|ACTUALLY QUITE YOUNG.
20101219053040.142|20101219053042.978|CC1|IF YOU GO BACK AND ASK THOSE
20101219053043.111|20101219053045.013|CC1|ELDERLY PATIENTS, MORE THAN 3/4
20101219053045.147|20101219053046.381|CC1|OF THE TIME THEY ACTUALLY WANTED

20101219053047.382|20101219053048.083|CC1|OFFERED TO THEM.
20101219053048.217|20101219053052.054|CC1|I THINK MAKING SURE WHAT WE KNOW

20101219053054.456|20101219053056.992|CC1|TO THOSE WHO NEED IT IS A VERY
20101219053057.126|20101219053057.860|CC1|IMPORTANT STEP.

20101219053112.274|20101219053113.709|CC1|HAVE DONE THIS, IT TURNED OUT
20101219053113.842|20101219053116.178|CC1|THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS LEVEL OF
20101219053116.311|20101219053116.545|CC1|DIVERSITY.
