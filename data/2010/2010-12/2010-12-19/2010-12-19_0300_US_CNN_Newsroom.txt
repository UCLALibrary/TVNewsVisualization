20101219031230.437|20101219031232.539|CC1|>> AUGUST 29th, 1996.
20101219031232.672|20101219031234.541|CC1|AFTER JUST TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE
20101219031234.674|20101219031237.711|CC1|AT STANFORD, TIGER WOODS STOOD
20101219031237.844|20101219031239.612|CC1|IN A MILWAUKEE BANQUET HALL AND
20101219031239.746|20101219031241.014|CC1|ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION TO TURN
20101219031241.147|20101219031241.281|CC1|PRO.
20101219031241.414|20101219031242.115|CC1|AND WHY NOT?
20101219031242.248|20101219031243.616|CC1|HE HAD JUST CAPTURED HIS THIRD
20101219031243.750|20101219031244.250|CC1|CONSECUTIVE U.S. AMATEUR
20101219031244.384|20101219031250.723|CC1|CHAMPIONSHIP.
20101219031250.857|20101219031252.292|CC1|>> HE HAD A PRESENCE ABOUT HIM
20101219031252.425|20101219031253.660|CC1|THAT CLEARLY SHOWED HE WAS NOT
20101219031253.793|20101219031255.061|CC1|GOING TO JUST AN PROFESSIONAL
20101219031255.194|20101219031256.729|CC1|PLAYER BUT HE HAD THE POTENTIAL
20101219031256.863|20101219031300.233|CC1|TO BE A GREAT ONE.
20101219031300.366|20101219031302.435|CC1|>> IN JUST HIS FIRST YEAR AS A
20101219031302.568|20101219031304.971|CC1|PRO HE EARNED $790,000 ON THE

20101219031305.404|20101219031306.472|CC1|AND THAT WAS POCKET CHANGE
20101219031306.606|20101219031309.075|CC1|COMPARED TO ENDORSEMENT DEALS
20101219031309.208|20101219031312.311|CC1|REPORTEDLY WORTH $43 MILLION.
20101219031312.445|20101219031315.047|CC1|BUT JUST AS TIGER'S CAREER BEGAN
20101219031315.181|20101219031317.016|CC1|TO SKYROCKET, HIS OLDER BROTHER
20101219031317.149|20101219031318.150|CC1|NOTICED A CHANGE.
20101219031318.284|20101219031321.320|CC1|>> WHEN HE TURNED PRO, IT BECAME
20101219031321.454|20101219031322.822|CC1|MORE DIFFICULT TO HAVE TIME WITH
20101219031322.955|20101219031323.255|CC1|HIM.
20101219031323.389|20101219031327.927|CC1|AND SINCE THEN, IT IS LIKE, IT
20101219031328.060|20101219031329.862|CC1|IS ALMOST AS THOUGH WE DON'T
20101219031329.995|20101219031330.896|CC1|MEASURE UP.
20101219031331.030|20101219031332.298|CC1|>> TIGER WOODS WAS IN DEMAND AND
20101219031332.431|20101219031336.568|CC1|IT WASN'T ALL JUST BUSINESS.
20101219031336.702|20101219031339.638|CC1|IN 2004, TIGER MARRIED LONG TIME
20101219031339.772|20101219031342.040|CC1|GIRLFRIEND SWEDE YISH NATIVE
20101219031342.174|20101219031342.941|CC1|ELIN NORDEGREN.
20101219031343.075|20101219031345.177|CC1|>> SHE RESISTED HIM AT FIRST.
20101219031345.310|20101219031346.078|CC1|SHE WASN'T INTO GOLF.
20101219031346.211|20101219031347.713|CC1|SHE CERTAINLY WASN'T INTO
20101219031347.846|20101219031349.114|CC1|CELEBRITIES AND SHE SAYS WHEN
20101219031349.248|20101219031350.682|CC1|SHE FIRST CAME OVER HERE, SHE
20101219031350.816|20101219031353.852|CC1|HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A LANGUAGE
20101219031353.986|20101219031354.186|CC1|BARRIER.
20101219031354.319|20101219031355.620|CC1|BUT THAT HE WAS FUN AND THEY
20101219031355.754|20101219031355.954|CC1|LAUGHED.
20101219031356.088|20101219031357.556|CC1|THEY HAD A GREAT TIME TOGETHER.
20101219031357.689|20101219031359.257|CC1|HE MADE HER BELIEVE IN LOVE.
20101219031359.391|20101219031400.258|CC1|>> THEY HAD TWO CHILDREN.
20101219031400.392|20101219031402.227|CC1|A DAUGHTER, SAM, AND CHARLIE,
20101219031402.360|20101219031403.028|CC1|THEIR SON.
20101219031403.161|20101219031404.529|CC1|THEY WERE A FAMILY.
20101219031404.663|20101219031406.464|CC1|MANY THOUGHT THE PERFECT FAMILY.
20101219031406.598|20101219031408.967|CC1|BUT SOON, HIS SIBLINGS LOST
20101219031409.100|20101219031412.070|CC1|CONTACT WITH HIM.
20101219031412.203|20101219031414.906|CC1|>> I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO TIGER
20101219031415.040|20101219031416.241|CC1|SINCE 2006.
20101219031416.374|20101219031418.209|CC1|WE'VE SENT HIM A COUPLE OF
20101219031418.343|20101219031420.111|CC1|LETTERS AND I'VE TRIED TO CALL A
20101219031420.245|20101219031421.846|CC1|COUPLE OF TIMES TO UPDATE HIM ON
20101219031421.980|20101219031423.448|CC1|WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FAMILY.
20101219031423.581|20101219031425.316|CC1|WE ARE A FAMILY.
20101219031425.450|20101219031427.018|CC1|AND I'VE GOTTEN NO RESPONSE.
20101219031427.152|20101219031428.920|CC1|>> YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOUR
20101219031429.053|20101219031432.223|CC1|BROTHER, YOUR BLOOD SINCE 2006.
20101219031432.357|20101219031434.158|CC1|NOW THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
20101219031434.292|20101219031435.727|CC1|ELSE GOING ON.
20101219031435.860|20101219031437.695|CC1|WAS THERE SOME TENSION OF SOME
20101219031437.829|20101219031437.996|CC1|KIND?
20101219031438.129|20101219031440.031|CC1|WHY HE WOULD JUST CUT THE FAMILY
20101219031440.164|20101219031440.298|CC1|OFF?
20101219031440.431|20101219031441.632|CC1|>> THERE WERE REPORTS THAT I HAD
20101219031441.766|20101219031443.101|CC1|BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM AND NOT
20101219031443.234|20101219031443.901|CC1|PAID HIM BACK.
20101219031444.035|20101219031445.570|CC1|THERE WAS A FAMILY ARGUMENT THAT
20101219031445.703|20101219031446.804|CC1|SPLIT THE FAMILY UP.
20101219031446.938|20101219031448.206|CC1|AND NONE OF THAT IS TRUE.
20101219031448.339|20101219031449.907|CC1|>> IN FACT, THE LAST TIME HE
20101219031450.041|20101219031451.275|CC1|SAYS HE SAW HIS LITTLE BROTHER
20101219031451.409|20101219031453.344|CC1|WAS AT THEIR FATHER'S FUNERAL.
20101219031453.477|20101219031454.612|CC1|>> HE WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO
20101219031454.745|20101219031456.647|CC1|ALLOW US TO JOIN HIM ON THE JET
20101219031456.781|20101219031501.252|CC1|TO TAKE MY DAD TO KANSAS TO BURY
20101219031501.385|20101219031502.653|CC1|HIS REMAINS.
20101219031502.787|20101219031504.789|CC1|AND I REMEMBER WE CAME OFF THE
20101219031504.922|20101219031507.091|CC1|JET, WALKED DOWN THE RUNWAY,
20101219031507.224|20101219031507.558|CC1|HUGGED.
20101219031507.691|20101219031508.459|CC1|HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
20101219031508.592|20101219031510.227|CC1|HE WENT THAT WAY WITH THE
20101219031510.361|20101219031511.528|CC1|ENTOURAGE AND WE WENT THIS WAY.
20101219031511.662|20101219031515.566|CC1|THAT WAS THE LAST I EVER SAW OF
20101219031515.699|20101219031515.833|CC1|HIM.
20101219031515.966|20101219031517.735|CC1|>> EARL WOODS JR. SAYS THEIR
20101219031517.868|20101219031518.936|CC1|FATHER'S DEATH HAD A MAJOR
20101219031519.069|20101219031520.404|CC1|IMPACT ON TIGER.
20101219031520.537|20101219031524.174|CC1|>> WHAT I SAW WAS THAT HE LOST A
20101219031524.308|20101219031525.309|CC1|PART OF HIMSELF.
20101219031525.442|20101219031527.211|CC1|I THINK THAT OUR FATHER WAS A
20101219031527.344|20101219031528.612|CC1|PART OF TIGER SO MUCH THAT WHEN
20101219031528.745|20101219031531.481|CC1|HE PASSED, TIGER BECAME LOST.
20101219031531.615|20101219031535.285|CC1|THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FILL
20101219031535.419|20101219031536.086|CC1|THAT VOID.
20101219031536.219|20101219031538.221|CC1|>> A FEW MONTHS BEFORE TIGER'S
20101219031538.355|20101219031539.956|CC1|FATHER LOST HIS BATTLE TO

20101219031552.168|20101219031553.036|CC1|THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

20101219034605.022|20101219034606.424|CC1|>> THAT'S TRUE.
20101219034606.557|20101219034608.893|CC1|THAT WAS REALLY THE CONUNDRUM
20101219034609.026|20101219034610.328|CC1|THAT THE DETECTIVES WERE FACING
20101219034610.461|20101219034612.363|CC1|WHEN THEY WENT INTO THIS MAN'S

20101219034621.105|20101219034622.473|CC1|THEY TRIED TO DO IT PRIVATELY
20101219034622.607|20101219034624.675|CC1|AND GOT TO THE END OF ALL THEIR
20101219034624.809|20101219034626.143|CC1|ROUTES ON THAT FRONT AND SAID,
20101219034626.277|20101219034627.745|CC1|WE FEEL WE HAVE NO OTHER OPTION
20101219034627.878|20101219034629.480|CC1|BUT TO GO TO THE PUBLIC AND SAY,

20101219034641.158|20101219034641.492|CC1|>> RIGHT.
20101219034641.625|20101219034643.861|CC1|SO THE IMAGES THAT WERE RELEASED
20101219034643.994|20101219034645.696|CC1|ARE VERY TIGHTLY CROPPED JUST TO
20101219034645.829|20101219034647.097|CC1|SHOW THE FACES OF THE WOMEN.
20101219034647.231|20101219034648.866|CC1|BUT THE PHOTOS THEMSELVES, AND

20101219035604.916|20101219035606.617|CC1|>> WELL, HERE IS WHERE I COME

20101219035607.718|20101219035609.187|CC1|I LISTENED TO THE PRESIDENT'S
20101219035609.320|20101219035610.021|CC1|MESSAGE THAT WEDNESDAY.
20101219035610.154|20101219035611.088|CC1|I BELIEVE IT WAS A WEDNESDAY.
20101219035611.222|20101219035612.957|CC1|WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT WHY HE
20101219035613.090|20101219035614.158|CC1|THOUGHT THIS WAS THE RIGHT
20101219035614.292|20101219035615.526|CC1|DIRECTION FOR THE COUNTRY TO GO
20101219035615.660|20101219035615.860|CC1|IN.
20101219035615.993|20101219035617.094|CC1|AND I BELIEVED WHAT HE SAID.
20101219035617.228|20101219035618.563|CC1|I BOUGHT OFF ON IT.
20101219035618.696|20101219035624.602|CC1|BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DARING
20101219035624.735|20101219035625.403|CC1|HIS DRIVING AGENDA WAS A COULD
20101219035625.536|20101219035625.936|CC1|N
20101219035626.070|20101219035628.939|CC1|NOT, A CONSTITUENT BASE.
20101219035629.073|20101219035630.608|CC1|HE WANTED TO BE SUPPORTIVE IN
20101219035630.741|20101219035631.175|CC1|ECONOMIC CHALLENGES.
20101219035631.308|20101219035632.410|CC1|I THINK HIS RIGHT WAS IN THE
20101219035632.543|20101219035633.744|CC1|RIGHT PLACE AND THE AGENDA WAS
20101219035633.878|20101219035634.612|CC1|IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
20101219035634.745|20101219035635.446|CC1|THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THE
20101219035635.579|20101219035637.248|CC1|CONCERN HE SHARES AND MANY IN

20101219035638.048|20101219035639.016|CC1|THAT'S THE ADDED DEBT.
20101219035639.150|20101219035641.252|CC1|BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS
20101219035641.385|20101219035644.755|CC1|THE FST INLE DECISIONS THAT
20101219035644.889|20101219035645.990|CC1|WILL HAVE TO BE MADE.

20101219035647.791|20101219035649.994|CC1|I'M THINKING FURTHER EFFECT ON

20101219035650.895|20101219035651.362|CC1|DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS
