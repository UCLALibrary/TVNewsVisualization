20101219172143.283|20101219172143.516|CC1|PROGRESS.
20101219172143.650|20101219172145.452|CC1|>> BUT ISN'T THE PROBLEM THAT,
20101219172145.585|20101219172147.120|CC1|YES, WE CAN MAKE -- THE TROOPS
20101219172147.253|20101219172148.989|CC1|ALWAYS DO THEIR JOB, IT SEEMS TO
20101219172149.122|20101219172149.255|CC1|ME.
20101219172149.389|20101219172150.924|CC1|THEY CAN DO IT, THAT'S NOT THE
20101219172151.057|20101219172151.257|CC1|PROBLEM.
20101219172151.391|20101219172153.059|CC1|THE PROBLEM IS, THEY DO IT HERE,
20101219172153.193|20101219172154.327|CC1|THEN THEY HAVE TO MOVE HERE, AND
20101219172154.461|20101219172156.062|CC1|EVERYBODY MOVES BACK IN.
20101219172156.196|20101219172158.731|CC1|AND REALLY AT THE BASE OF IT IS
20101219172158.865|20101219172159.098|CC1|PAKISTAN.
20101219172159.232|20101219172200.767|CC1|>> CANDY, I THINK IT'S WISE TO
20101219172200.900|20101219172202.635|CC1|KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'VE GONE
20101219172202.769|20101219172205.004|CC1|THROUGH SEVERAL PHASES OF OUR
20101219172205.138|20101219172205.772|CC1|ACTIVITY IN AFGHANISTAN.
20101219172205.905|20101219172207.340|CC1|AND IN THE LAST YEAR, YEAR AND A
20101219172207.473|20101219172209.876|CC1|HALF, THERE'S NOW A CONCERTED
20101219172210.009|20101219172212.278|CC1|EFFORT TO TRY TO GET A BETTER
20101219172212.412|20101219172213.746|CC1|HANDLE ON SECURITY IN THE SOUTH
20101219172213.880|20101219172216.115|CC1|WHERE THINGS HAVE BEEN MOST
20101219172216.249|20101219172216.516|CC1|PROBLEMATIC.
20101219172216.649|20101219172217.617|CC1|AT THE SAME TIME, THINGS IN
20101219172217.750|20101219172218.751|CC1|PAKISTAN HAVE CHANGED TOO.
20101219172218.885|20101219172220.319|CC1|AND IT SEEMS ONE OF THE THINGS
20101219172220.453|20101219172222.488|CC1|THAT I NOTED IS THAT IN
20101219172222.622|20101219172223.623|CC1|PAKISTAN, JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME
20101219172223.756|20101219172226.158|CC1|IT LOOKS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE
20101219172226.292|20101219172228.728|CC1|THINGS GETTING READY TO MAKE
20101219172228.861|20101219172229.762|CC1|SOME PROGRESS, SOMETHING ELSE
20101219172229.895|20101219172230.796|CC1|HAPPENS THAT'S DISTRACTING.
20101219172230.930|20101219172233.265|CC1|FOR EXAMPLE, THE FLOODS AND THE
20101219172233.399|20101219172234.600|CC1|NATURAL DISASTER THIS YEAR, I
20101219172234.733|20101219172235.868|CC1|THINK, HAD A BIG AFFECT ON
20101219172236.001|20101219172236.969|CC1|PULLING RESOURCES AWAY.
20101219172237.102|20101219172237.870|CC1|IT'S A CHALLENGE.
20101219172238.003|20101219172239.004|CC1|I THINK PROGRESS IS BEING MADE
20101219172239.138|20101219172239.572|CC1|RIGHT NOW.
20101219172239.705|20101219172241.373|CC1|>> LET ME ASK YOU, MR.
20101219172241.507|20101219172242.274|CC1|AMBASSADOR, BECAUSE I WANT TO
20101219172242.408|20101219172243.008|CC1|READ YOU SOMETHING.
20101219172243.142|20101219172245.678|CC1|A MAN YOU KNOW WELL, HAMID
20101219172245.811|20101219172247.379|CC1|KARZAI, IN A MID-NOVEMBER
20101219172247.513|20101219172248.580|CC1|INTERVIEW IN "THE WASHINGTON
20101219172248.714|20101219172249.848|CC1|POST," WHICH I'M SURE YOU READ,
20101219172249.982|20101219172252.851|CC1|PART OF WHAT HE SAID WAS, "THE
20101219172252.985|20101219172257.489|CC1|WAR ON TERROR," WHICH IS WHY WE
20101219172257.623|20101219172300.192|CC1|WENT TO AFGHANISTAN, "CANNOT BE
20101219172300.325|20101219172300.826|CC1|CONDUCTED IN AFGHANISTAN,
20101219172300.959|20101219172301.426|CC1|BECAUSE THAT ISN'T HERE.
20101219172301.560|20101219172302.794|CC1|IT IS SOMEWHERE ELSE.
20101219172302.928|20101219172303.395|CC1|WE ARE ONLY REAPING THE
20101219172303.528|20101219172306.531|CC1|CONSEQUENCES OF IT HERE."
20101219172306.665|20101219172308.133|CC1|AGAIN, WE HAVE WHAT HAVE BEEN
20101219172308.266|20101219172309.167|CC1|CONTINUING COMPLAINTS OF
20101219172309.301|20101219172310.335|CC1|CORRUPTION WITH THE KARZAI
20101219172310.469|20101219172310.836|CC1|GOVERNMENT.
20101219172310.969|20101219172314.639|CC1|WORSE, WE HAVE A POPULOUS THAT
20101219172314.773|20101219172315.674|CC1|DOESN'T TRUST THE CENTRAL
20101219172315.807|20101219172317.509|CC1|GOVERNMENT IN KABUL.
20101219172317.642|20101219172319.344|CC1|AND IT HASN'T SEEMED TO CHANGE.
20101219172319.477|20101219172320.512|CC1|WHAT MOVES THAT DIME?
20101219172320.645|20101219172322.214|CC1|>> I THINK WHAT KARZAI WAS
20101219172322.347|20101219172324.783|CC1|SAYING REFLECTS A BIG PROBLEM,
20101219172324.916|20101219172326.718|CC1|WHICH IS, FIRST, OUR
20101219172326.851|20101219172328.386|CC1|RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.
20101219172328.520|20101219172329.554|CC1|S THERE A TRUST DEFICIT.
20101219172329.688|20101219172331.956|CC1|AND A TRUST DEFICIT IS BECAUSE
20101219172332.090|20101219172335.160|CC1|OF NOT ONLY THE WAY WE HAVE
20101219172335.293|20101219172336.561|CC1|HANDLED THEM IN RECENT
20101219172336.694|20101219172336.961|CC1|PERIODS --
20101219172337.095|20101219173639.029|SEG|Type=Story
20101219172337.095|20101219172338.997|CC1|>>> BY CRITICIZING HIM OPENLY,
20101219172339.130|20101219172339.764|CC1|THAT KIND OF THING.
20101219172339.898|20101219172341.633|CC1|>> AND THE PERCEPTION THAT WE
20101219172341.766|20101219172342.600|CC1|OPPOSED HIM DURING THE
20101219172342.734|20101219172343.835|CC1|PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WE
20101219172343.968|20101219172345.503|CC1|SUPPORTED HIS OPPONENT.
20101219172345.637|20101219172349.640|CC1|AND BEING TOO PUBLIC IN OUR
20101219172349.774|20101219172350.007|CC1|CRITICISM.
20101219172350.141|20101219172352.910|CC1|BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE
20101219172353.044|20101219172355.680|CC1|COMPLAINTS WITH REGARD TO
20101219172355.813|20101219172359.250|CC1|GOVERNANCE, HIS GOVERNMENT NOT
20101219172359.383|20101219172400.051|CC1|PERFORMING, BECAUSE SUCCESS
20101219172400.184|20101219172401.819|CC1|REQUIRES THAT HE DOES HIS PART.
20101219172401.953|20101219172403.588|CC1|AND THE SECOND, THIS
20101219172403.721|20101219172404.956|CC1|DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN US, A
20101219172405.089|20101219172406.123|CC1|SIGNIFICANT -- A AGREEMENT THAT
20101219172406.257|20101219172408.259|CC1|HAS NARROWED NOW OVER PAKISTAN.
20101219172408.392|20101219172410.227|CC1|HE HAS COMPLAINED FOR YEARS THAT
20101219172410.361|20101219172412.863|CC1|THE SANCTUARY IS -- NEEDS TO BE
20101219172412.997|20101219172414.198|CC1|ADDRESSED.
20101219172414.331|20101219172417.201|CC1|IT HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED.
20101219172417.334|20101219172419.270|CC1|THERE IS SOME PROGRESS.
20101219172419.403|20101219172420.537|CC1|BUT I THINK WHY OUR MILITARY IS
20101219172420.671|20101219172422.539|CC1|DOING ITS PART, NO DOUBT, WE
20101219172422.673|20101219172426.076|CC1|FEED A BIG DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO
20101219172426.210|20101219172428.612|CC1|MAKE PAKISTAN FROM BEING BOTH
20101219172428.746|20101219172430.848|CC1|ADVERSARY AND FRIEND TO BEING
20101219172430.981|20101219172433.350|CC1|LESS ADVERSARY AND MORE FRIEND.
20101219172433.484|20101219172434.918|CC1|AND THIS HASN'T HAPPENED YET.
20101219172435.052|20101219172437.487|CC1|>> AND ISN'T IT KEY -- I FEEL AS
20101219172437.621|20101219172439.189|CC1|THOUGH, YOU KNOW, ARE WE PUSHING
20101219172439.323|20101219172439.923|CC1|PAKISTAN TOO HARD?
20101219172440.057|20101219172443.427|CC1|ARE WE NOT PUSHING THEM ENOUGH?
20101219172443.560|20101219172445.262|CC1|BECAUSE EVERY YEAR, IT'S LIKE,
20101219172445.395|20101219172446.797|CC1|WELL, WHAT WE REALLY NEED HERE
20101219172446.930|20101219172448.465|CC1|IS FOR THESE SAFE HAVENS IN
20101219172448.598|20101219172450.000|CC1|PAKISTAN TO BE DESTROYED.
20101219172450.133|20101219172451.368|CC1|ONCE AGAIN, PAKISTAN IS NOW
20101219172451.501|20101219172453.670|CC1|SAYING TO US, YES, THIS NEXT
20101219172453.804|20101219172454.738|CC1|YEAR IS GOING TO BE THE YEAR
20101219172454.871|20101219172456.139|CC1|THAT WE MOVE THE TROOPS IN.
20101219172456.273|20101219172457.908|CC1|IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S ALL ABOUT
20101219172458.041|20101219172458.808|CC1|PAKISTAN AT THIS POINT, AND WE
20101219172458.942|20101219172500.644|CC1|HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MOVE THEM.
20101219172500.777|20101219172503.313|CC1|>> WELL, GO AHEAD -- GO AHEAD,
20101219172503.446|20101219172503.613|CC1|BILL.
20101219172503.747|20101219172507.751|CC1|>> THERE'S BEEN LONG-STANDING
20101219172507.884|20101219172508.885|CC1|FINGER-POINTING ACROSS THE DURAN
20101219172509.018|20101219172511.654|CC1|LINE, BOTH FROM ISLAMABAD AND
20101219172511.788|20101219172511.955|CC1|KABUL.
20101219172512.088|20101219172513.423|CC1|IF ONLY THEY'D FIX THIS, THEN WE
20101219172513.556|20101219172515.458|CC1|WOULD HAVEN'T A PROBLEM AND VICE
20101219172515.592|20101219172515.758|CC1|VERSA.
20101219172515.892|20101219172517.026|CC1|THE REALITY IS, THEY BOTH HAVE
20101219172517.160|20101219172517.760|CC1|TO MOVE FORWARD.
20101219172517.894|20101219172518.861|CC1|THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTALS HERE
20101219172518.995|20101219172520.229|CC1|IN MY OPINION THAT NEED TO BE
20101219172520.363|20101219172521.798|CC1|ADDRESSED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
20101219172521.931|20101219172522.131|CC1|BORDER.
20101219172522.265|20101219172523.299|CC1|AND THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH
20101219172523.433|20101219172523.933|CC1|ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT.
20101219172524.067|20101219172526.002|CC1|AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE,
20101219172526.135|20101219172527.703|CC1|BOTH IF AFGHANISTAN AND
20101219172527.837|20101219172529.038|CC1|PAKISTAN, THEY NEED A LOT OF
20101219172529.172|20101219172529.338|CC1|HELP.
20101219172529.472|20101219172531.874|CC1|AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING IT,
20101219172532.008|20101219172533.142|CC1|FRANKLY, FROM EITHER GOVERNMENT.
20101219172533.276|20101219172534.377|CC1|AND FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL
20101219172534.510|20101219172535.945|CC1|THERE IN THE LONG-TERM, IT SEEMS
20101219172536.078|20101219172537.380|CC1|TO ME THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
20101219172537.513|20101219172538.648|CC1|TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO
20101219172538.781|20101219172540.616|CC1|DO -- MAKE A MAJOR EFFORT IN
20101219172540.750|20101219172541.384|CC1|DEVELOPMENT.
20101219172541.517|20101219172542.685|CC1|AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN

20101219172543.219|20101219172545.154|CC1|>> MY GOODNESS, HAVEN'T WE GIVEN
20101219172545.287|20101219172547.289|CC1|MILLIONS TO PAKISTAN --
20101219172547.423|20101219172548.824|CC1|>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
20101219172548.958|20101219172549.625|CC1|GOVERNMENT, I'M TALKING ABOUT
20101219172549.759|20101219172550.025|CC1|INVESTMENT.
20101219172550.159|20101219172551.360|CC1|I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
20101219172551.494|20101219172553.395|CC1|POTENTIAL FOR PRIVATE
20101219172553.529|20101219172554.296|CC1|INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY IN

20101219172556.232|20101219172558.033|CC1|AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
20101219172558.167|20101219172559.201|CC1|TRYING TO ESTABLISH IN THE SOUTH
20101219172559.335|20101219172601.036|CC1|AND USE THIS AS A FOUNDATION TO

20101219172601.837|20101219172606.008|CC1|>> I DON'T THINK THE PROBLEM OF
20101219172606.141|20101219172606.742|CC1|WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN PAKISTAN IS
20101219172606.875|20101219172608.343|CC1|AN ISSUE OF DEVELOPMENT, WITH

20101219172610.045|20101219172611.046|CC1|IT'S THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN,

20101219172612.815|20101219172614.349|CC1|IT'S THE PAKISTANI INTELLIGENCE
20101219172614.483|20101219172616.151|CC1|AGENCY THAT'S TOLERATING,
20101219172616.285|20101219172617.920|CC1|SUPPORTING, ALLOWING THESE
20101219172618.053|20101219172618.320|CC1|SANCTUARIES.
20101219172618.453|20101219172620.656|CC1|SO IT REQUIRES A HUGE DIPLOMATIC
20101219172620.789|20101219172621.123|CC1|EFFORT.
20101219172621.256|20101219172622.991|CC1|WE HAVE TO WORK WITH NOT ONLY

20101219172634.569|20101219172636.338|CC1|WE SHOULD PUT, IN MY VIEW, BOTH

20101219172651.319|20101219172652.720|CC1|FOR WITHOUT THAT, IT WILL TAKE A
20101219172652.854|20101219172654.656|CC1|LONG TIME FOR US TO SUCCEED, AND
20101219172654.789|20101219172656.357|CC1|I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE HAVE THE
20101219172656.491|20101219172657.225|CC1|POLITICAL TIMETABLE AVAILABLE --
20101219172657.358|20101219172658.493|CC1|>> ENOUGH TIME LEFT TO ACTUALLY
20101219172658.626|20101219172659.694|CC1|DO THAT.
20101219172659.827|20101219172701.629|CC1|THIS IS A LONG-TERM PROJECT,
20101219172701.763|20101219172702.530|CC1|RE-DOING THAT RELATIONSHIP.
20101219172702.663|20101219172703.731|CC1|GENERAL, I WANT TO BRING YOU IN,
20101219172703.865|20101219172705.099|CC1|BUT I WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING
20101219172705.233|20101219172706.033|CC1|FIRST AND HAVE WHAT YOU WANT TO
20101219172706.167|20101219172706.868|CC1|SAY HERE.
20101219172707.001|20101219172709.070|CC1|THIS IS FROM A DAVID SANGER

20101219172720.348|20101219172721.682|CC1|I THINK THE SITUATION OVER

20101219172724.618|20101219172725.986|CC1|A STABLE AFGHANISTAN WITHOUT

20101219172730.724|20101219172731.892|CC1|I THINK THEY GO TOGETHER.
20101219172732.026|20101219172733.027|CC1|THERE ARE DIFFERENT CONCERNS IN
20101219172733.160|20101219172734.094|CC1|BOTH PLACES.
20101219172734.228|20101219172735.429|CC1|ONE HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, OF

20101219172735.896|20101219172736.430|CC1|BUT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH
20101219172736.563|20101219172737.631|CC1|ANYTHING THE AMBASSADOR SAID,
20101219172737.765|20101219172740.000|CC1|BUT I WOULD ALIGN MYSELF WITH

20101219172746.106|20101219172746.840|CC1|SUFFERING RIGHT NOW.
20101219172746.974|20101219172748.342|CC1|IF WE WOULD JUST OPEN UP OUR

20101219172749.576|20101219172751.445|CC1|SOMETHING THEY'VE TALKED TO ME

20101219172753.880|20101219172755.349|CC1|WOULD REALLY HELP THEM.
20101219172755.482|20101219172756.450|CC1|>> WHY HAVEN'T WE?

20101219172812.766|20101219172814.000|CC1|WHILE THE PAKISTANIS MAYBE HAVE
20101219172814.134|20101219172815.268|CC1|NOT BEEN AS AGGRESSIVE IN THE

20101219172817.270|20101219172819.305|CC1|LIKED, WE'RE AGGRESSIVE IN
20101219172819.439|20101219172823.743|CC1|THERE, AND HAVE HAD QUITE AN

20101219172831.818|20101219172833.586|CC1|BUT THE UPSIDE IS, THE

20101219172835.421|20101219172837.023|CC1|QAEDA, HAVE BEEN SLOWLY ERODED
20101219172837.156|20101219172838.858|CC1|IN THE TRIBAL AREAS.
20101219172838.991|20101219172840.927|CC1|>> OUR MOVEMENT AND PAKISTANI'S
20101219172841.060|20101219172842.195|CC1|HAVE BEEN FOCUSED MORE ON AL
20101219172842.328|20101219172843.062|CC1|QAEDA, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT.
20101219172843.196|20101219172845.898|CC1|BUT NEITHER OF US, NOT US NOR
20101219172846.032|20101219172847.300|CC1|THE PAKISTANIS HAVE MOVED
20101219172847.433|20101219172848.601|CC1|AGAINST THE TALIBAN LEADERS WHO
20101219172848.734|20101219172850.403|CC1|ARE FIGHTING US IN AFGHANISTAN.
20101219172850.536|20101219172850.836|CC1|>> RIGHT.
20101219172850.970|20101219172852.738|CC1|>> AND I BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT
20101219172852.872|20101219172854.206|CC1|TO BE CONSIDERING TO DO MORE FOR
20101219172854.340|20101219172855.341|CC1|PAKISTAN, INCLUDING ON THE
20101219172855.474|20101219172856.742|CC1|ECONOMIC FRONT.
20101219172856.876|20101219172858.444|CC1|BUT IT HAS TO BE VERY MUCH
20101219172858.577|20101219172859.845|CC1|CONTINGENT WITH TIMELINES IN
20101219172859.979|20101219172902.581|CC1|TERMS OF WHAT THEY WILL DO.
20101219172902.715|20101219172904.450|CC1|BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY
20101219172904.583|20101219172905.885|CC1|ENGAGING IN THE HOPE THAT THEY
20101219172906.018|20101219172906.318|CC1|WOULD CHANGE.
20101219172906.452|20101219172908.621|CC1|THAT HAS NOT WORKED.
20101219172908.754|20101219172911.824|CC1|WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE LINKING

20101219172915.928|20101219172917.229|CC1|FOR, OTHERWISE, I THINK WE'VE

20101219172921.934|20101219172922.801|CC1|THEY UNDERSTAND IT.
20101219172922.935|20101219172923.835|CC1|THAT'S WHY I THINK THEY'D BE
20101219172923.969|20101219172925.237|CC1|RELUCTANT TO CHANGE, UNLESS WE
20101219172925.370|20101219172927.239|CC1|CHANGE OUR CALCULUS BY PUTTING

20101219172939.551|20101219172942.153|CC1|THAT THIS IS JUST PART OF THE

20101219172943.955|20101219172945.023|CC1|THIS WAS, TO ME, JUSTIFICATION.
20101219172945.156|20101219172945.824|CC1|YOU SAY IT'S REAL.

20101219173006.978|20101219173007.478|CC1|WHAT DO YOU THINK?
20101219173007.612|20101219173009.647|CC1|>> CANDY, FIRST, WHO KNOWS, THE

20101219173010.114|20101219173011.249|CC1|BUT THE REALITY IS THAT
20101219173011.382|20101219173011.949|CC1|DIFFERENT PEOPLE FOCUS ON
20101219173012.083|20101219173012.683|CC1|DIFFERENT THINGS.
20101219173012.817|20101219173014.752|CC1|AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE MOST
20101219173014.886|20101219173016.087|CC1|IMPORTANT THING IS, WHAT'S GOING
20101219173016.220|20101219173018.489|CC1|ON OVER THERE, IN THE REGION.
20101219173018.623|20101219173019.523|CC1|ON THE GROUND IN AFGHANISTAN.
20101219173019.657|20101219173021.525|CC1|IT APPEARS THAT PROGRESS IS
20101219173021.659|20101219173022.159|CC1|BEING MADE.
20101219173022.293|20101219173024.261|CC1|AND THAT WE'RE MAKING A VERY
20101219173024.395|20101219173025.796|CC1|CONCERTED EVERY TO WORK,
20101219173025.930|20101219173029.467|CC1|PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHERN
20101219173029.600|20101219173029.767|CC1|AREAS.
20101219173029.900|20101219173031.836|CC1|BUT AS HAS COME OUT HERE, THERE
20101219173031.969|20101219173033.871|CC1|ARE MANY ASPECTS THAT NEED TO BE
20101219173034.004|20101219173034.839|CC1|ADDRESSED SIMULTANEOUSLY.
20101219173034.972|20101219173036.540|CC1|THE GOVERNMENT ISSUE, VERY, VERY
20101219173036.674|20101219173036.974|CC1|IMPORTANT.
20101219173037.107|20101219173037.942|CC1|YOU CAN'T DEAL JUST WITH
20101219173038.075|20101219173038.342|CC1|AFGHANISTAN.
20101219173038.475|20101219173039.343|CC1|YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE
20101219173039.476|20101219173039.677|CC1|REGION.
20101219173039.810|20101219173040.611|CC1|AND THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN
20101219173040.744|20101219173041.512|CC1|PLAY A ROLE.
20101219173041.645|20101219173042.913|CC1|I AGREE WITH THE AMBASSADOR THAT
20101219173043.047|20101219173045.549|CC1|WE HAVE GOT TO CONTINUE TO KEEP
20101219173045.683|20101219173048.352|CC1|PRESSURE OF A SORT ON THE
20101219173048.485|20101219173049.453|CC1|PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT, TO DO
20101219173049.586|20101219173050.854|CC1|THINGS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO
20101219173050.988|20101219173052.623|CC1|OURSELVES AND TO THEM AND TO THE
20101219173052.756|20101219173053.857|CC1|AFGHANS IN THAT REGION, AND
20101219173053.991|20101219173055.392|CC1|MAYBE WE CAN PLAY A ROLE -- A
20101219173055.526|20101219173056.393|CC1|LARGER ROLE IN THE REGION.
20101219173056.526|20101219173057.794|CC1|ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN PAKISTAN
20101219173057.928|20101219173100.364|CC1|IS THE LONG-STANDING FOCUS ON
20101219173100.497|20101219173101.832|CC1|INDIA AND THE SECURITY BETWEEN
20101219173101.965|20101219173102.799|CC1|THE TWO.
20101219173102.933|20101219173104.868|CC1|AND I THINK THAT IS A HUGE
20101219173105.001|20101219173105.802|CC1|DETRACTOR FROM THE THINGS WE
20101219173105.936|20101219173108.605|CC1|WOULD LIKE TO SEE GOING ON IN
20101219173108.738|20101219173109.639|CC1|WESTERN AFGHANISTAN, BECAUSE IT
20101219173109.773|20101219173111.107|CC1|JUST REALLY SEEMS DIFFICULT TO
20101219173111.241|20101219173113.143|CC1|GET THEM TO GET THEIR FOCUS OFF
20101219173113.276|20101219173113.643|CC1|OF INDIA.
20101219173113.777|20101219173115.178|CC1|IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE PAST
20101219173115.312|20101219173115.645|CC1|THAT TIME.
20101219173115.779|20101219173117.213|CC1|WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET OVER
20101219173117.347|20101219173117.614|CC1|IT.
20101219173117.747|20101219173119.582|CC1|BUT THAT'S A THING THAT WE MIGHT
20101219173119.716|20101219173121.451|CC1|BE ABLE TO HELP IN THE LARGER
20101219173121.584|20101219173122.352|CC1|DIPLOMATIC AREA TO BUILD

20101219173124.554|20101219173125.855|CC1|>> I HAVE TO QUICKLY MOVE YOU ON
20101219173125.989|20101219173127.223|CC1|TO SOMETHING ELSE, BECAUSE IT'S
20101219173127.357|20101219173129.159|CC1|JUST ON THE FRONT PAGES, AND
20101219173129.292|20101219173130.293|CC1|THAT IS KOREA.
20101219173130.426|20101219173132.629|CC1|THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL ABOUT

20101219173135.732|20101219173138.801|CC1|TELL NORTH KOREA TO BACK OFF.
20101219173138.935|20101219173140.002|CC1|NORTH KOREA'S PRETTY MUCH IMMUNE
20101219173140.136|20101219173142.338|CC1|TO THAT SORT OF THING, ARE THEY
20101219173142.472|20101219173142.605|CC1|NOT?
20101219173142.739|20101219173144.006|CC1|>> YEAH, THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT
20101219173144.140|20101219173145.341|CC1|TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MOTIVATES
20101219173145.475|20101219173145.641|CC1|THEM.
20101219173145.775|20101219173148.177|CC1|IT SEEMS LIKE REGIME SURVIVAL IS
20101219173148.311|20101219173154.350|CC1|THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY
20101219173154.483|20101219173155.751|CC1|FOCUSES THEIR ATTENTION.
20101219173155.885|20101219173158.054|CC1|AND THE DIPLOMATIC EFFORT AT THE

20101219173200.890|20101219173201.724|CC1|CAN INFLUENCE THEM WOULD BE
20101219173201.857|20101219173204.627|CC1|WHERE CHINA COMES DOWN ON THIS.
20101219173204.760|20101219173208.364|CC1|AND THE CHINESE NEED TO DO MORE,
20101219173208.497|20101219173210.032|CC1|BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE NECESSARY
20101219173210.165|20101219173211.533|CC1|LEVERAGE TO SHAPE THE BEHAVIOR
20101219173211.667|20101219173212.301|CC1|OF NORTH KOREA.
20101219173212.434|20101219173213.702|CC1|>> AND I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR
20101219173213.836|20101219173215.337|CC1|BOTH OF YOU, IF I COULD GET

20101219173219.074|20101219173220.242|CC1|>> I THINK THIS IS A LOT OF

20101219173222.111|20101219173227.282|CC1|SO, I MEAN, IT DEPENDS IN PART
20101219173227.416|20101219173228.150|CC1|ON KOREA'S REACTION, BUT GIVEN
20101219173228.283|20101219173231.320|CC1|THE STAKES AND HOW TRAGIC ANY
20101219173231.453|20101219173232.954|CC1|INCIDENT COULD BE OR ANY FURTHER

20101219173235.490|20101219173236.258|CC1|SPOT, BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S
20101219173236.391|20101219173240.061|CC1|A REAL WORRY ABOUT BREAKING ANY
20101219173240.195|20101219173240.395|CC1|FURTHER.
20101219173240.529|20101219173242.364|CC1|>> THE FOCUS, I BELIEVE, OF THE

20101219173244.199|20101219173245.834|CC1|REGIME SURVIVAL.

20101219173727.677|20101219173729.812|CC1|>> WELL, I THINK IT WAS AMAZING
20101219173729.946|20101219173732.015|CC1|TO SEE THESE TWO DAYS BACK TO

20101219173737.153|20101219173737.820|CC1|GREAT CONSEQUENCE.
20101219173737.954|20101219173739.756|CC1|AND THEN THE FOLLOWING DAY, A
20101219173739.889|20101219173742.291|CC1|BIPARTISAN VOTE ON THE REPEAL OF
20101219173742.425|20101219173742.859|CC1|DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL.
20101219173742.992|20101219173745.228|CC1|I DO LOOK AT THE TAX CUT
20101219173745.361|20101219173746.028|CC1|COMPROMISE AS BIPARTISANSHIP
20101219173746.162|20101219173747.196|CC1|THAT MIGHT EVAPORATE.
20101219173747.330|20101219173748.831|CC1|THERE WAS A LOOMING DEADLINE,
20101219173748.965|20101219173749.966|CC1|NEITHER PARTY WANTED TO BE
20101219173750.099|20101219173752.301|CC1|RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOWING THOSE

20101219173754.804|20101219173756.705|CC1|AND THEN YOU LOOK AT DASK DEL,
20101219173756.839|20101219173758.040|CC1|AND THAT WAS GENUINE.
20101219173758.174|20101219173800.409|CC1|I MEAN, WHEN IT WAS ATTACHED TO
20101219173800.543|20101219173802.144|CC1|OTHER VEHICLES, YOU COULD HIDE
20101219173802.278|20101219173804.079|CC1|BEHIND PROCEDURAL VOTES.
20101219173804.213|20101219173806.715|CC1|ONCE IT WAS A CLEAN UP OR DOWN
20101219173806.849|20101219173807.883|CC1|VOTE, THERE WERE SOME SURPRISES.
20101219173808.017|20101219173809.051|CC1|EIGHT REPUBLICANS CROSSING THE

20101219173810.819|20101219173812.254|CC1|AN ISSUE THAT THE TOP BRASS AND
20101219173812.388|20101219173815.491|CC1|THE PENTAGON HAD ASKED THEM TO
20101219173815.624|20101219173820.095|CC1|WEIGH NIN ON AND URGE THEM FOR
20101219173820.229|20101219173820.996|CC1|THE REPEAL.
20101219173821.129|20101219173822.364|CC1|I JUST DON'T KNOW THE ISSUES OF

20101219173823.799|20101219173824.900|CC1|TERRIBLE FISCAL MATTERS THEY'RE

20101219173831.973|20101219173832.574|CC1|OF THING.
20101219173832.707|20101219173834.042|CC1|>> MATT, I THINK THAT THE
20101219173834.176|20101219173835.710|CC1|PRESIDENT HAS DONE SURPRISINGLY
20101219173835.844|20101219173837.779|CC1|WELL IN DECEMBER.
20101219173837.913|20101219173838.813|CC1|AND WE'RE NOW BEGINNING TO SEE A
20101219173838.947|20101219173840.248|CC1|NUMBER OF COLUMNISTS, NOT ALWAYS
20101219173840.382|20101219173841.683|CC1|HAPPILY SAYING, THE PRESIDENT
20101219173841.816|20101219173842.851|CC1|HAS REALLY BOUNCED BACK.
20101219173842.984|20101219173844.386|CC1|DO YOU BUY INTO IT THAT?
20101219173844.519|20101219173845.687|CC1|>> I THINK HE'S AT THE BEGINNING
20101219173845.820|20101219173846.287|CC1|OF SOMETHING.
20101219173846.421|20101219173847.422|CC1|I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S POSSIBLE.
20101219173847.555|20101219173849.691|CC1|AND I'M GOING TO BE MORE OF AN
20101219173849.824|20101219173850.525|CC1|OPTIMIST ON THE BIPARTISANSHIP
20101219173850.658|20101219173850.825|CC1|THING.
20101219173850.959|20101219173852.360|CC1|I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE.
20101219173852.494|20101219173853.862|CC1|LOOK, HE'S BEEN GIVEN A PRETTY
20101219173853.995|20101219173856.431|CC1|DIFFICULT MANDATE HERE BY THE
20101219173856.564|20101219173856.864|CC1|VOTERS, RIGHT?
20101219173856.998|20101219173859.000|CC1|THEY WANT HIM TO CUT SPENDING,
20101219173859.133|20101219173900.735|CC1|CREATE JOBS, WORK WITH
20101219173900.868|20101219173903.137|CC1|REPUBLICANS, BUT DON'T WORK WITH
20101219173903.271|20101219173904.172|CC1|REPUBLICANS TOO MUCH, BECAUSE
20101219173904.305|20101219173906.841|CC1|THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY ENDORSED
20101219173906.974|20101219173907.942|CC1|THE AGENDA TOO MUCH.
20101219173908.075|20101219173910.111|CC1|SO HE HAS A DIFFICULT PATH TO
20101219173910.244|20101219173911.712|CC1|NAVIGATE, BUT THERE'S A BETTER
20101219173911.846|20101219173913.981|CC1|CLIMATE FOR BIPARTISANSHIP IN

20101219173914.982|20101219173916.150|CC1|HAD UNDER A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE.
20101219173916.284|20101219173917.985|CC1|NOW THERE'S ROOM TO BUILD
20101219173918.119|20101219173918.386|CC1|COALITIONS.
20101219173918.519|20101219173920.454|CC1|THAT IS WHERE HE TEMPERAMENTALLY

20101219173920.888|20101219173922.289|CC1|AND I THINK YOU SAW SOME OF THAT
20101219173922.423|20101219173923.424|CC1|COMFORT WHEN HE CAME OUT AND

20101219173927.328|20101219173929.163|CC1|>> AND, IN FACT, THERE'S NO
20101219173929.296|20101219173930.965|CC1|CHOICE, REALLY, ON EITHER SIDE,
20101219173931.098|20101219173932.132|CC1|IS THERE?
20101219173932.266|20101219173933.334|CC1|BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS GOING
20101219173933.467|20101219173935.002|CC1|TO HAVE TO MOVE A LITTLE AWAY
20101219173935.135|20101219173938.405|CC1|FROM HIS LEFT, BECAUSE HE CAN'T
20101219173938.539|20101219173939.573|CC1|GOVERN THERE, BECAUSE THERE JUST
20101219173939.706|20101219173940.407|CC1|AREN'T THE NUMBERS.
20101219173940.541|20101219173941.809|CC1|AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO

20101219173947.881|20101219173949.149|CC1|SO THERE KIND OF IS ROOM IN THE

20101219173950.484|20101219173951.952|CC1|>> I DON'T KNOW ON THE

20101219173952.653|20101219173953.420|CC1|I THINK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA

20101219173956.923|20101219173958.492|CC1|MESSAGE WAS THAT THE VOTERS WANT

20101219174012.272|20101219174013.306|CC1|>> BUT YOU HEARD MITCH McCONNELL

20101219174019.012|20101219174020.680|CC1|LEADERSHIP WILL RESIST THAT, BUT
20101219174020.813|20101219174021.948|CC1|THERE WILL BE OTHER TIMES
20101219174022.081|20101219174024.284|CC1|THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO YEARS

20101219174030.790|20101219174032.458|CC1|ALLUDED TO IT EARLIER, IS
20101219174032.592|20101219174032.892|CC1|SELF-INTEREST.
20101219174033.025|20101219174033.860|CC1|BIPARTISANSHIP HAPPENS WHEN BOTH

20101219174038.631|20101219174039.765|CC1|THE COST OF DOING SOMETHING THAT
20101219174039.899|20101219174040.967|CC1|PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DISAGREE

20101219174041.500|20101219174042.101|CC1|I THINK WE PROBABLY HAVE AT

20101219174043.602|20101219174044.637|CC1|THEY CAN DO MORE OF THAT.
20101219174044.770|20101219174047.073|CC1|ONCE YOU GET INTO THE
