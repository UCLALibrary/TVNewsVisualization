20101219180433.033|20101219180434.167|CC1|>>> WE CAN ALL REMEMBER THE

20101219180441.641|20101219180442.576|CC1|ABOUT MONEY.
20101219180442.709|20101219180443.410|CC1|THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS
20101219180443.543|20101219180444.544|CC1|RAISING FEES AND SLASHING ITS

20101219180453.153|20101219180456.656|CC1|THE MAN AT THE CENTER OF THIS
20101219180456.790|20101219180458.391|CC1|AUSTERITY IS GEORGE OSBORN.

20101219180459.359|20101219180501.027|CC1|BRITAIN.
20101219180501.161|20101219180501.761|CC1|HE'S GOING TO EXPLAIN TO US WHY.
20101219180501.895|20101219180502.495|CC1|WELCOME, GEORGE OSBORNE.
20101219180502.629|20101219180504.464|CC1|>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
20101219180504.597|20101219180506.499|CC1|>> WHAT TO MAKE OF THESE
20101219180506.633|20101219180507.900|CC1|PROTESTS, AND THE LAST I
20101219180508.034|20101219180508.735|CC1|REMEMBER THESE PROTESTS THEY

20101219180509.736|20101219180511.304|CC1|THE MINERS.
20101219180511.437|20101219180512.438|CC1|IS THIS AS SERIOUS A MOMENT IN
20101219180512.572|20101219180513.906|CC1|BRITAIN'S HISTORY?
20101219180514.040|20101219180516.142|CC1|>> I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME.
20101219180516.275|20101219180517.610|CC1|THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS, THERE
20101219180517.743|20101219180518.678|CC1|WERE PROTESTS ABOUT THE IRAQ
20101219180518.811|20101219180522.948|CC1|WAR, VERY BIG PROTESTS UNDER

20101219180524.517|20101219180525.551|CC1|OBVIOUSLY SOME STUDENTS DON'T
20101219180525.684|20101219180526.952|CC1|WANT TO PAY HIGHER FEES, THAT'S
20101219180527.086|20101219180527.787|CC1|WHAT THE ISSUE WAS WITH THIS
20101219180527.920|20101219180529.221|CC1|PARTICULAR DISTURBANCE.
20101219180529.355|20101219180533.892|CC1|WE WERE SEEKING A HIGHER

20101219180537.196|20101219180538.664|CC1|BUT WE BELIEVE NOT ONLY DOES IT
20101219180538.797|20101219180540.566|CC1|HELP DEAL WITH THAT BUDGET
20101219180540.699|20101219180541.867|CC1|DEFICIT THAT YOU ENTERED THE
20101219180542.000|20101219180543.368|CC1|PROGRAM, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT
20101219180543.502|20101219180544.303|CC1|MAKING SURE THAT BRITISH
20101219180544.436|20101219180545.237|CC1|UNIVERSITIES HAVE STABLE SOURCES
20101219180545.370|20101219180547.739|CC1|OF FUNDING AND ARE UP THERE,
20101219180547.873|20101219180550.842|CC1|COMPETING WITH THE BEST AMERICAN
20101219180550.976|20101219180552.544|CC1|UNIVERSITIES AND CHINESE AND

20101219180554.413|20101219180558.783|CC1|LEADER IN HIGHER EDUCATION.
20101219180558.917|20101219180559.885|CC1|THE POINT IS IT'S JUST ONE OF
20101219180600.018|20101219180601.820|CC1|THE EXAMPLES OF THE REFORMS THAT
20101219180601.953|20101219180602.621|CC1|WE'RE DOING, WHICH ARE BOTH
20101219180602.754|20101219180603.922|CC1|ABOUT REDUCING THE GOVERNMENT
20101219180604.055|20101219180604.255|CC1|BUDGET.
20101219180604.389|20101219180605.590|CC1|WE'VE GOT A VERY BIG BUDGET
20101219180605.724|20101219180606.658|CC1|DEFICIT IN BRITAIN, BUT ALSO
20101219180606.791|20101219180607.792|CC1|ABOUT MAKING THE LONG-TERM
20101219180607.926|20101219180611.996|CC1|REFORMS THAT KEEP THE UK A
20101219180612.130|20101219180612.730|CC1|COMPETITIVE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS
20101219180612.864|20101219180613.531|CC1|FOR YEARS AHEAD.
20101219180613.665|20101219180614.666|CC1|>> SO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS
20101219180614.799|20101219180616.935|CC1|PEOPLE SAY AND YOU HAVE CRITICS
20101219180617.068|20101219180619.504|CC1|IN BRITAIN FROM THE LABOR PARTY,
20101219180619.637|20101219180621.205|CC1|ECONOMISTS AND SCHOLARS LIKE
20101219180621.339|20101219180622.907|CC1|LORD SKIDELSKE, WHO SAYS HOW CAN
20101219180623.041|20101219180624.342|CC1|YOU AT A MOMENT OF FRAGILITY IN
20101219180624.475|20101219180626.878|CC1|THE RECOVERY TAKE ALL THIS MONEY
20101219180627.011|20101219180628.613|CC1|OUT OF THE ECONOMY?
20101219180628.746|20101219180630.314|CC1|IF THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO
20101219180630.448|20101219180632.283|CC1|WITHDRAW MONEY FROM THE ECONOMY,
20101219180632.416|20101219180633.718|CC1|IT MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE BUYING
20101219180633.851|20101219180634.852|CC1|FEWER THINGS, AND IF IT'S BUYING
20101219180634.986|20101219180636.020|CC1|FEWER THINGS, THERE WILL BE
20101219180636.153|20101219180637.988|CC1|FEWER PEOPLE PRODUCING THEM.
20101219180638.122|20101219180639.123|CC1|SO WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THAT?
20101219180639.256|20101219180640.558|CC1|YOU WILL BE WITHDRAWING A LOT OF
20101219180640.691|20101219180642.526|CC1|MONEY FROM THE ECONOMY.
20101219180642.660|20101219180643.961|CC1|>> WELL, WHAT I WOULD SAY IS,
20101219180644.094|20101219180645.396|CC1|FIRST OF ALL, IT'S ABOUT
20101219180645.529|20101219180646.797|CC1|CONFIDENCE.
20101219180646.931|20101219180648.532|CC1|IT'S ABOUT CONFIDENCE THAT THE
20101219180648.666|20101219180649.933|CC1|GOVERNMENT HAS A PLAN TO DEAL
20101219180650.067|20101219180651.068|CC1|WITH WHAT IS A VERY LARGE BUDGET
20101219180651.201|20101219180652.202|CC1|DEFICIT.
20101219180652.336|20101219180656.473|CC1|THE HIGHEST BUDGET DEFICIT IN
20101219180656.607|20101219180657.708|CC1|THE G-20.
20101219180657.841|20101219180658.575|CC1|AND I THINK WE HAVE SHOWN OVER
20101219180658.709|20101219180701.912|CC1|THE LAST SIX MONTHS BECAUSE
20101219180702.045|20101219180703.113|CC1|WE'RE A RELATIVELY NEW
20101219180703.246|20101219180704.981|CC1|GOVERNMENT, THAT WE CAN INSTILL
20101219180705.115|20101219180705.682|CC1|THAT CONFIDENCE, WE'VE EARNED
20101219180705.816|20101219180706.817|CC1|THAT MARKET CONFIDENTABILITY.
20101219180706.950|20101219180707.651|CC1|THERE IS AT THE MOMENT CONCERNS
20101219180707.784|20101219180708.351|CC1|ABOUT EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNS AND
20101219180708.485|20101219180709.086|CC1|THEIR DEBTS.
20101219180709.219|20101219180709.953|CC1|THERE ARE NOT CONCERNS ABOUT THE
20101219180710.086|20101219180710.787|CC1|U.K.
20101219180710.921|20101219180711.655|CC1|IF ANYTHING, OUR CREDIT RATING
20101219180711.788|20101219180716.092|CC1|HAS BEEN AFFIRMED.
20101219180716.226|20101219180719.596|CC1|AND YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THE
20101219180719.729|20101219180720.196|CC1|COUNTERFACTUAL QUESTION.
20101219180720.330|20101219180722.966|CC1|IF WE WERE NOT TAKING THESE
20101219180723.099|20101219180724.167|CC1|MEASURES, IF WE WERE NOT BEING
20101219180724.300|20101219180725.001|CC1|DECISIVE IN DEALING WITH OUR
20101219180725.135|20101219180726.603|CC1|DEFICIT, WHERE WOULD BRITAIN BE?
20101219180726.736|20101219180727.337|CC1|AND I THINK BRITAIN WILL BE IN
20101219180727.470|20101219180728.304|CC1|THE FIRING LINE AT THE MOMENT OF
20101219180728.438|20101219180729.439|CC1|A SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS.
20101219180729.572|20101219180730.573|CC1|>> YOU HAD SOME EXTRAORDINARY
20101219180730.707|20101219180731.441|CC1|PITHY QUOTE TO THE "SPECTATOR"
20101219180731.574|20101219180732.308|CC1|MAGAZINE, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS
20101219180732.442|20101219180733.710|CC1|JUST WONDERFUL.
20101219180733.843|20101219180734.844|CC1|YOU SAY, YOU'RE EXPLAINING WHY
20101219180734.977|20101219180736.846|CC1|-- MOST AMERICAN CONSERVATIVES
20101219180736.979|20101219180738.815|CC1|DON'T REALIZE THIS -- YOU RAISED
20101219180738.948|20101219180742.418|CC1|THE VALUE ADDED TAX, NATIONAL
20101219180742.552|20101219180743.920|CC1|SALES TAX IN BRITAIN FROM 17.5%
20101219180744.053|20101219180745.488|CC1|TO 20%, AND THEN ANNOUNCED THIS
20101219180745.621|20101219180746.222|CC1|WAS NOT A TEMPORARY RISE, THIS
20101219180746.355|20101219180750.659|CC1|WAS GOING TO BE PERMANENT.
20101219180750.793|20101219180752.161|CC1|THEN YOU SAID, "ONCE WE CAN
20101219180752.294|20101219180752.895|CC1|BRING SOME STABILITY TO THE

20101219180757.399|20101219180758.434|CC1|BUT IT IS A COMPLETELY MIRAGE TO
20101219180758.567|20101219180759.935|CC1|CUT TAXES ONE YEAR, THEN TO HAVE
20101219180800.069|20101219180801.337|CC1|TO BORROW THE MONEY AND PUT UP
20101219180801.470|20101219180803.238|CC1|THE TAXES LATER TO PAY FOR THAT

20101219180805.808|20101219180806.508|CC1|THAT STRIKES ME AS EXACTLY WHAT
20101219180806.642|20101219180807.376|CC1|THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED

20101219180808.644|20101219180809.344|CC1|>> FIRST OF ALL, I AM A FISCAL
20101219180809.478|20101219180811.346|CC1|CONSERVATIVE.
20101219180811.480|20101219180814.883|CC1|I WANT TO SEE LOWER TAXES, I
20101219180815.017|20101219180815.584|CC1|WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE THE TAX
20101219180815.717|20101219180816.118|CC1|BURDEN.
20101219180816.251|20101219180816.985|CC1|BUT I THINK IN A COUNTRY LIKE
20101219180817.119|20101219180817.853|CC1|THE U.K., THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN
20101219180817.986|20101219180818.987|CC1|DO THAT IS ONCE YOU'VE GOT
20101219180819.121|20101219180819.821|CC1|STABLE PUBLIC FINANCES AND YOU
20101219180819.955|20101219180821.256|CC1|ARE NOT RUNNING A HIGHER

20101219180825.794|20101219180828.163|CC1|THE U.S. IS A DIFFERENT PLACE

20101219180829.931|20101219180830.665|CC1|BUT I MAKE THIS OBSERVATION THAT
20101219180830.799|20101219180833.635|CC1|EVEN IN THE U.S. THERE IS A

20101219180846.848|20101219180847.882|CC1|PROGRESSING AT THE MOMENT
20101219180848.015|20101219180849.083|CC1|THROUGH THE CONGRESS,BUT I
20101219180849.217|20101219180850.318|CC1|THINK IT'S CREATED AN
20101219180850.451|20101219180851.252|CC1|INTERESTING DEBATE IN AMERICA,
20101219180851.385|20101219180852.753|CC1|AND I CERTAINLY FIND IT
20101219180852.887|20101219180853.354|CC1|INTERESTING THAT THIS
20101219180853.487|20101219180854.322|CC1|INDEPENDENT COMMISSION CAME TO
20101219180854.455|20101219180855.189|CC1|MANY OF THE SAME CONCLUSIONS
20101219180855.323|20101219180857.725|CC1|THAT WE CAME TO, WHICH IS, MAKE
20101219180857.858|20101219180859.327|CC1|SURE IT'S MAINLY DONE THROUGH
20101219180859.460|20101219180900.895|CC1|EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT, LOOK AT
20101219180901.028|20101219180901.962|CC1|THE RETIREMENT AGE, AND ACTUALLY
20101219180902.096|20101219180902.696|CC1|TRY TO REDUCE YOUR CORPORATE TAX

20101219180905.199|20101219180906.200|CC1|>> BUT AFTER THOSE WONDERFUL
20101219180906.333|20101219180907.067|CC1|RECOMMENDATIONS CAME OUT AND I
20101219180907.201|20101219180909.603|CC1|WROTE COLUMNS IN FAVOR OF THEM,
20101219180909.737|20101219180911.438|CC1|VERY QUICKLY WE DECIDED, OH,
20101219180911.572|20101219180912.606|CC1|THIS IS TOO TEDIOUS.
20101219180912.740|20101219180916.443|CC1|LET'S GIVE OURSELVES A BIG TAX

20101219180918.212|20101219180918.645|CC1|>> TO BE FAIR TO THE

20101219180923.050|20101219180924.318|CC1|EXPIRING, AND I CAN SEE WHY THEY
20101219180924.451|20101219180925.452|CC1|TOOK THE DECISIONS THEY'VE
20101219180925.586|20101219180928.021|CC1|TAKEN.
20101219180928.155|20101219180929.156|CC1|ACTUALLY IN THE U.K. AS WELL AS
20101219180929.289|20101219180930.290|CC1|THE INCREASE IN THE SALES TAX
20101219180930.424|20101219180932.592|CC1|YOU REFERRED TO, I AM ACTUALLY

20101219180939.266|20101219180940.267|CC1|BUT YOU PAY -- YOU GET TAX FREE
20101219180940.400|20101219180943.536|CC1|BEFORE YOU PAY ANYTHING.
20101219180943.670|20101219180944.838|CC1|>> WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE
20101219180944.971|20101219180945.939|CC1|YOU'RE TAXING CONSUMPTION AND
20101219180946.072|20101219180947.307|CC1|NOT TAXING INCOME, WHICH IS WHAT
20101219180947.440|20101219180948.007|CC1|WE SHOULD BE DOING.
20101219180948.141|20101219180949.909|CC1|BUT WE'RE DOING THE OPPOSITE.
20101219180950.043|20101219180952.045|CC1|>> I -- YOU ARE MORE OF AN
20101219180952.178|20101219180952.779|CC1|EXPERT ON AMERICAN POLITICS THAN

20101219180954.747|20101219180956.849|CC1|BUT I MADE THE OBSERVATION THAT
20101219180956.983|20101219180958.351|CC1|YOU DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL SALES
20101219180958.484|20101219181000.887|CC1|TAX, AND I SUSPECT WITH YOUR
20101219181001.020|20101219181003.689|CC1|VERY GOOD CHECK AND BALANCES AND
20101219181003.823|20101219181004.457|CC1|THE CONSTITUTION, IT MIGHT BE
20101219181004.590|20101219181006.392|CC1|VERY DIFFICULT TO INTRODUCE ONE.
20101219181006.526|20101219181007.260|CC1|>> LET'S TALK ABOUT EUROPE.
20101219181007.393|20101219181007.994|CC1|HOW SERIOUS IS THE CRISIS RIGHT
20101219181008.127|20101219181008.661|CC1|NOW?
20101219181008.794|20101219181009.795|CC1|CAN EUROPE HANDLE A CONTINUING
20101219181009.929|20101219181011.530|CC1|LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE
20101219181011.664|20101219181012.665|CC1|ABILITY OF THESE COUNTRIES, NOW
20101219181012.798|20101219181014.633|CC1|SUBSTANTIAL COUNTRIES, TO PAY
20101219181014.767|20101219181015.468|CC1|THEIR DEBTS?
20101219181015.601|20101219181016.635|CC1|>> WELL, EUROPE SHOULDN'T HAVE
20101219181016.769|20101219181017.470|CC1|TO HANDLE THAT.
20101219181017.603|20101219181018.604|CC1|EUROPE NEEDS TO DEAL DECISIVELY
20101219181018.737|20101219181022.308|CC1|WITH IT, AND I'VE SPENT MUCH OF
20101219181022.441|20101219181023.742|CC1|MY LAST SIX WEEKS DISCUSSING
20101219181023.876|20101219181024.576|CC1|THIS ISSUE WITH FELLOW EUROPEAN
20101219181024.710|20101219181025.978|CC1|FINANCE MINISTERS.
20101219181026.111|20101219181026.845|CC1|AND I THINK THERE ARE TWO
20101219181026.979|20101219181029.748|CC1|COMPONENTS TO THE SOLUTION.
20101219181029.882|20101219181031.717|CC1|ONE IS THE EURO ZONE, THE
20101219181031.850|20101219181033.685|CC1|COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THE EURO AS
20101219181033.819|20101219181035.487|CC1|THEIR CURRENCY, NEED TO COME UP
20101219181035.621|20101219181036.822|CC1|WITH A DECISIVE PLAN TO DEAL
20101219181036.955|20101219181037.956|CC1|WITH THE IMBALANCES IN A SINGLE
20101219181038.090|20101219181041.360|CC1|CURRENCY AREA WHEN YOU DON'T
20101219181041.493|20101219181046.231|CC1|ALSO HAVE A SINGLE POLITICAL
20101219181046.364|20101219181048.300|CC1|AREA OR A SINGLE FISCAL AREA.
20101219181048.433|20101219181049.067|CC1|THE SECOND ELEMENT TO THE
20101219181049.201|20101219181049.968|CC1|SOLUTION IS THAT COUNTRIES NEED
20101219181050.102|20101219181051.303|CC1|TO RESOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS.
20101219181051.436|20101219181052.170|CC1|IRELAND'S GOT A MAJOR BANKING
20101219181052.304|20101219181054.773|CC1|PROBLEM, AND IS NOW WITH
20101219181054.906|20101219181055.507|CC1|INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, DEALING
20101219181055.640|20101219181055.874|CC1|WITH IT.
20101219181056.007|20101219181057.008|CC1|PORTUGAL'S GOT A LONG-TERM
20101219181057.142|20101219181057.843|CC1|PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEM AND NEEDS
20101219181057.976|20101219181102.214|CC1|TO ADDRESS THAT.
20101219181102.347|20101219181103.448|CC1|SPAIN HAS GOT PROBLEMS IN ITS
20101219181103.582|20101219181104.182|CC1|REGIONAL BANKS AND IS ADDRESSING
20101219181104.316|20101219181108.119|CC1|THAT.
20101219181108.253|20101219181110.722|CC1|SO, YES, THE EURO'S GOT TO ACT,
20101219181110.855|20101219181111.423|CC1|BUT THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES
20101219181111.556|20101219181112.524|CC1|HAVE GOT TO ACT.
20101219181112.657|20101219181113.692|CC1|>> WHEN YOU WATCH THE CHINESE,
20101219181113.825|20101219181114.559|CC1|THE SOUTH KOREANS, THE SINGAPORE
20101219181114.693|20101219181116.227|CC1|GOVERNMENT PUT MASSIVE AMOUNTS

20101219181121.666|20101219181124.035|CC1|ARE FUNDING, AND I LOOK AT THE
20101219181124.169|20101219181125.336|CC1|WESTERN GOVERNMENTS, YOU KNOW,
20101219181125.470|20101219181126.604|CC1|HOBBLED BY BUDGET DEFICITS,
20101219181126.738|20101219181128.439|CC1|STARVED FOR CASH, ARE WE GOING
20101219181128.573|20101219181130.541|CC1|TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN A NEW
20101219181130.675|20101219181131.576|CC1|WORLD IN WHICH THERE ARE THESE
20101219181131.709|20101219181133.444|CC1|MASSIVE INVESTMENTS TAKING PLACE
20101219181133.578|20101219181134.979|CC1|IN THE EAST AND ESSENTIALLY

20101219181137.682|20101219181138.950|CC1|>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WESTERN
20101219181139.083|20101219181144.088|CC1|GOVERNMENTS NEED TO PROTECT THE
20101219181144.221|20101219181144.689|CC1|MOST IMPORTANT CAPITAL

20101219181145.222|20101219181146.957|CC1|SO SPEAKING FOR THE UK, WE'RE

20101219181158.435|20101219181159.170|CC1|I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THE
20101219181159.303|20101219181159.837|CC1|INVESTMENT COMING INTO THE
20101219181159.970|20101219181200.571|CC1|ECONOMICALLY MOST SIGNIFICANT

20101219181203.841|20101219181205.409|CC1|SUM GAME WITH THE EAST.
20101219181205.543|20101219181207.678|CC1|AND WE SHOULD BE PLEASED IN THE

20101219181208.979|20101219181209.680|CC1|THAT MANY MILLIONS OF FAMILIES

20101219181747.444|20101219181748.445|CC1|>> I THINK AT THE MOMENT IT
20101219181748.579|20101219181749.580|CC1|LOOKS LIKE A DECADE OF LOW
20101219181749.713|20101219181750.447|CC1|GROWTH AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT FOR
20101219181750.581|20101219181753.851|CC1|EUROPE AND FOR AMERICA.
20101219181753.984|20101219181755.286|CC1|AND WE'RE BOTH EXPERIENCING THE
20101219181755.419|20101219181756.720|CC1|SAME PROBLEM, THAT PRODUCTION
20101219181756.854|20101219181757.855|CC1|HAS MOVED TO A LARGE EXTENT TO
20101219181757.988|20101219181759.556|CC1|ASIA.
20101219181759.690|20101219181800.691|CC1|CONSUMER DEMAND IN AMERICA AND
20101219181800.824|20101219181804.094|CC1|EUROPE HAS GOT TO BE HELD BACK.
20101219181804.228|20101219181805.529|CC1|THE BANKS ARE DELEVERAGING,
20101219181805.662|20101219181806.930|CC1|THEY'RE NOT REALLY LENDING
20101219181807.064|20101219181808.098|CC1|ENOUGH TO SMALL BUSINESSES.
20101219181808.232|20101219181809.766|CC1|IF THAT WAS THE ONLY STORY IN
20101219181809.900|20101219181811.201|CC1|TOWN, I WOULD SEE THIS DECADE AS
20101219181811.335|20101219181813.170|CC1|BEING ONE THAT YOU MIGHT WRITE
20101219181813.303|20101219181816.306|CC1|UP LATER AS ONE OF NATIONAL
20101219181816.440|20101219181818.308|CC1|DECLINE OR DECLINE FOR THE WEST.
20101219181818.442|20101219181820.010|CC1|BUT I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER
20101219181820.143|20101219181821.411|CC1|FORCE AT WORK, AND THAT IS THE
20101219181821.545|20101219181822.579|CC1|MASSIVE EXPANSION OF ASIAN
20101219181822.713|20101219181824.281|CC1|CONSUMER DEMAND.
20101219181824.414|20101219181825.716|CC1|NOW THAT IS THE HOPE FOR THE
20101219181825.849|20101219181826.850|CC1|BRITISH, THE EUROPEAN, AND THE
20101219181826.983|20101219181830.287|CC1|AMERICAN ECONOMIES.
20101219181830.420|20101219181831.121|CC1|YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILLION
20101219181831.254|20101219181831.955|CC1|CONSUMERS.
20101219181832.088|20101219181833.123|CC1|YOU'VE GOING TO HAVE A CONSUMER
20101219181833.256|20101219181834.558|CC1|MARKET TWICE THE SIZE OF TODAY'S
20101219181834.691|20101219181835.959|CC1|AMERICAN MARKET, AT SOME POINT
20101219181836.092|20101219181838.261|CC1|QUITE SOON IN THE EAST.
20101219181838.395|20101219181839.663|CC1|AND THAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A
20101219181839.796|20101219181841.064|CC1|BRITISH, AMERICAN, EUROPEAN
20101219181841.197|20101219181842.499|CC1|EXPORTS, BRITISH TECHNOLOGY,
20101219181842.632|20101219181847.771|CC1|EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULAR
20101219181847.904|20101219181850.039|CC1|AMERICAN INNOVATIVE GENIUS.
20101219181850.173|20101219181852.742|CC1|SO I'M LOOKING AT THE FUTURE
20101219181852.876|20101219181854.143|CC1|TRENDS, AND IT'S A VERY
20101219181854.277|20101219181855.311|CC1|DIFFICULT PICTURE TO PRESENT,
20101219181855.445|20101219181856.045|CC1|BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE PESSIMISTIC
20101219181856.179|20101219181857.747|CC1|AND LOOKING AT THINGS AND
20101219181857.880|20101219181858.448|CC1|RETREATING INTO INTERNATIONAL
20101219181858.581|20101219181900.616|CC1|SHELLS AT THE MOMENT.
20101219181900.750|20101219181904.854|CC1|BUT IF WE SEE THE BIGGER
20101219181904.987|20101219181906.255|CC1|PICTURE, THE REAL STRATEGY HERE
20101219181906.389|20101219181910.393|CC1|WILL BE THE EXPANSION OF
20101219181910.526|20101219181912.361|CC1|ASIAN/EUROPEAN DEMAND.
20101219181912.495|20101219181913.229|CC1|>> PEOPLE LOOK AND SAY YOU'VE
20101219181913.362|20101219181914.096|CC1|PRESIDED OVER A GOLDEN DECADE.
20101219181914.230|20101219181914.930|CC1|IN RETROSPECT, THERE WERE MANY
20101219181915.064|20101219181916.065|CC1|OF THE PROBLEMS THAT MORPHED
20101219181916.198|20101219181917.500|CC1|INTO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, WERE
20101219181917.633|20101219181918.634|CC1|BEING BUILT UP DURING YOUR
20101219181918.768|20101219181919.802|CC1|DECADE.
20101219181919.935|20101219181922.905|CC1|WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO --
20101219181923.038|20101219181924.039|CC1|THE PARALLEL CRITICISM IS MADE
20101219181924.173|20101219181930.379|CC1|ABOUT ALAN GREENSPAN AND LARRY
20101219181930.512|20101219181932.114|CC1|SUMMERS, THAT YOU ALLOWED THE
20101219181932.247|20101219181938.086|CC1|LAX REGULATION, THE DEREGULATION
20101219181938.220|20101219181938.821|CC1|OF THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY THAT
20101219181938.954|20101219181939.788|CC1|CAUSED THE PROBLEM.
20101219181939.922|20101219181941.190|CC1|>> WELL, I HOLD MY HANDS UP FOR
20101219181941.323|20101219181942.057|CC1|SAYING, LOOK, WE DID NOT
20101219181942.191|20101219181942.791|CC1|UNDERSTAND THAT THESE FINANCIAL
20101219181942.925|20101219181943.358|CC1|INSTITUTIONS WERE NOT
20101219181943.492|20101219181944.092|CC1|DIVERSIFYING THE RISK ACROSS THE
20101219181944.226|20101219181944.893|CC1|SYSTEM.
20101219181945.027|20101219181946.595|CC1|AND YET ALL THESE NEW
20101219181946.728|20101219181947.729|CC1|INSTRUMENTS AND ALL THESE NEW
20101219181947.863|20101219181948.597|CC1|INSTITUTIONS AND TO BE HONEST,
20101219181948.730|20101219181949.431|CC1|THE RISK WAS BEING CONCENTRATED
20101219181949.564|20101219181950.565|CC1|RATHER THAN BEING DIVERSIFIED,
20101219181950.699|20101219181951.700|CC1|BUT WE HAD NO MEANS OF
20101219181951.833|20101219181952.868|CC1|DISCOVERING WHAT WAS GOING ON IN
20101219181953.001|20101219181957.606|CC1|THIS SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM.
20101219181957.739|20101219181959.408|CC1|BUT I MYSELF WAS SAYING FROM
20101219181959.541|20101219182001.710|CC1|1997 ONWARDS, THAT WE REALLY HAD
20101219182001.843|20101219182002.310|CC1|TO HAVE A PROPER GLOBAL
20101219182002.444|20101219182003.411|CC1|REGULATORY SYSTEM.
20101219182003.545|20101219182004.045|CC1|TO BE HONEST, I COULDN'T
20101219182004.179|20101219182005.680|CC1|PERSUADE OTHER COUNTRIES.
20101219182005.814|20101219182006.815|CC1|AND THAT IS REALLY -- WE KNEW
20101219182006.948|20101219182008.550|CC1|FROM THE ASIAN CRISIS THAT A
20101219182008.683|20101219182010.519|CC1|GLOBAL SYSTEM HAD TO EMERGE,
20101219182010.652|20101219182013.054|CC1|THAT WAS AN EARLY WARNING
20101219182013.188|20101219182014.055|CC1|SYSTEM, THAT WAS TRANSPARENT,
20101219182014.189|20101219182015.056|CC1|THAT GAVE US MORE INFORMATION
20101219182015.190|20101219182016.658|CC1|ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
20101219182016.791|20101219182018.126|CC1|NOW, WE'VE LEARNED A LESSON,
20101219182018.259|20101219182019.728|CC1|I'VE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS,
20101219182019.861|20101219182021.029|CC1|BUT I THINK WE ACTED VERY
20101219182021.162|20101219182022.831|CC1|QUICKLY ONCE WE SAW WHAT THE
20101219182022.964|20101219182023.798|CC1|PROBLEM WAS.
20101219182023.932|20101219182025.533|CC1|>> YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE
20101219182025.667|20101219182027.068|CC1|IN THAT YOU HAVE DEALT WITH BOTH
20101219182027.202|20101219182029.037|CC1|THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND THE
20101219182029.170|20101219182029.704|CC1|OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AT THE
20101219182029.837|20101219182030.338|CC1|HIGHEST LEVELS.
20101219182030.471|20101219182030.972|CC1|WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE
20101219182031.105|20101219182034.175|CC1|DIFFERENCE?
20101219182034.309|20101219182034.942|CC1|>> I THINK THE OBAMA
20101219182035.076|20101219182036.644|CC1|ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DEAL
20101219182036.778|20101219182038.112|CC1|WITH WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL
20101219182038.246|20101219182041.082|CC1|PROBLEM THAT FACES AMERICA.
20101219182041.215|20101219182043.818|CC1|I THINK YOU THAT IT'S BEEN
20101219182043.951|20101219182044.952|CC1|DIAGNOSED, THAT YOU'VE REALLY
20101219182045.086|20101219182046.554|CC1|GOT TO REBALANCE YOUR
20101219182046.687|20101219182048.122|CC1|CONSUMPTION AND YOUR PRODUCTION.
20101219182048.255|20101219182051.425|CC1|THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS
20101219182051.559|20101219182052.760|CC1|SEEKING TO DEAL WITH THAT
20101219182052.893|20101219182053.094|CC1|PROBLEM.
20101219182053.227|20101219182054.228|CC1|I THINK THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS
20101219182054.361|20101219182055.362|CC1|BEFORE WAS THAT THESE PROBLEMS
20101219182055.496|20101219182056.730|CC1|TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.
20101219182056.864|20101219182058.165|CC1|NOW YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT TO
20101219182058.299|20101219182058.499|CC1|ACT.
20101219182058.632|20101219182100.434|CC1|NOW, THE QUESTION IS, CAN THE
20101219182100.568|20101219182101.335|CC1|AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION FORM
20101219182101.468|20101219182103.237|CC1|LATE WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF
20101219182103.370|20101219182106.006|CC1|OUR MODERN MARSHALL PLAN, WHERE
20101219182106.140|20101219182107.408|CC1|YOU CAN PERSUADE THE REST OF THE
20101219182107.541|20101219182108.442|CC1|WORLD THAT IT'S IN THEIR
20101219182108.575|20101219182109.810|CC1|INTEREST TO WORK TOGETHER WITH
20101219182109.943|20101219182112.913|CC1|AMERICA AND WITH EUROPE, TO
20101219182113.046|20101219182114.681|CC1|FORMULATE A GROWTH PLAN FOR THE
20101219182114.815|20101219182115.516|CC1|WORLD ECONOMY.
20101219182115.649|20101219182118.118|CC1|SEE, I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE.
20101219182118.252|20101219182119.319|CC1|I THINK YOU COULD PERSUADE.
20101219182119.453|20101219182121.021|CC1|I DON'T SEE THE MERIT IN
20101219182121.154|20101219182122.656|CC1|ATTACKING CHINA ON CURRENCY.
20101219182122.789|20101219182124.625|CC1|BUT I THINK YOU CAN PERSUADE THE
20101219182124.758|20101219182125.559|CC1|CHINESE THAT THEY CAN RAISE
20101219182125.692|20101219182126.593|CC1|THEIR CONSUMPTION.
20101219182126.727|20101219182129.930|CC1|THEIR OWN CITIZENS, 35% OF THEIR
20101219182130.063|20101219182132.099|CC1|NATIONAL INCOME IS CONSUMPTION.
20101219182132.232|20101219182136.069|CC1|IN AMERICA, IT'S 25%.
20101219182136.203|20101219182137.270|CC1|THEIR OWN NEED TO RAISE
20101219182137.404|20101219182138.038|CC1|THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY.
20101219182138.171|20101219182139.906|CC1|A BIGGER MIDDLE CLASS IN CHINA.
20101219182140.040|20101219182144.177|CC1|AND I THINK THE OBAMA
20101219182144.311|20101219182145.312|CC1|ADMINISTRATION SEE THAT THE
20101219182145.445|20101219182146.012|CC1|ROUTE TO AMERICAN PROSPERITY
20101219182146.146|20101219182146.713|CC1|LIES NOT ONLY IN WHAT HAPPENS
20101219182146.846|20101219182148.014|CC1|WITH AMERICA, BUT IN EXPORTING
20101219182148.148|20101219182149.349|CC1|TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.
20101219182149.482|20101219182150.650|CC1|BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD GO A BIT
20101219182150.784|20101219182152.352|CC1|FURTHER AND SEE THIS AS A MODERN
20101219182152.485|20101219182153.687|CC1|MARSHALL PLAN, WHERE YOU BRING
20101219182153.820|20101219182155.188|CC1|IN THE REST OF THE WORLD TO
20101219182155.321|20101219182156.689|CC1|AVOID WHAT I STILL THINK COULD
20101219182156.823|20101219182158.958|CC1|BE IF WE DON'T ACT, A LOW GROWTH
20101219182159.092|20101219182200.293|CC1|AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT DECADE.
20101219182200.426|20101219182203.062|CC1|>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE
20101219182203.196|20101219182204.163|CC1|OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S DEAL WITH
20101219182204.297|20101219182206.232|CC1|CONGRESS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY A
20101219182206.366|20101219182210.069|CC1|SECOND STIMULUS, USING TAX CUTS
20101219182210.203|20101219182211.004|CC1|RATHER THAN A GOVERNMENT

20101219183523.216|20101219183524.985|CC1|>> JUST UTTERLY DEVASTATED.

20101219183526.419|20101219183527.954|CC1|HOLBROOKE WOULD EVER DIE.
20101219183528.088|20101219183528.855|CC1|THOUGHT HE'D BURY US ALL.
20101219183528.989|20101219183530.557|CC1|HE HAD A LIFE FORCE THE LIKES OF
20101219183530.690|20101219183533.093|CC1|WHICH I'VE NEVER SEEN.
20101219183533.226|20101219183535.662|CC1|TO ACCOMPLISH THINGS.
20101219183535.795|20101219183537.931|CC1|DICK REALLY WANTED TO DO GREAT
20101219183538.064|20101219183542.168|CC1|THINGS, TO BE IN HISTORY.
20101219183542.302|20101219183545.338|CC1|AND IT WAS THE AMBITION I THINK
20101219183545.472|20101219183547.607|CC1|ALL OF US HAVE BUT ALWAYS
20101219183547.740|20101219183549.042|CC1|HARNESSED TO SOME GREAT CAUSE.
20101219183549.175|20101219183552.145|CC1|>> LET ME ASK YOU, THOUGH, THERE
20101219183552.278|20101219183554.147|CC1|WAS ONE ASPECTS OF HIM THAT
20101219183554.280|20101219183554.981|CC1|EVERYBODY AGREES ABOUT AND THAT
20101219183555.114|20101219183555.848|CC1|WE WOULD, I THINK, ALL AGREE
20101219183555.982|20101219183556.449|CC1|WITH, HAVING KNOWN HIM
20101219183556.582|20101219183559.519|CC1|PERSONALLY.
20101219183559.652|20101219183601.821|CC1|HE WAS NOT DIPLOMATIC.
20101219183601.954|20101219183604.090|CC1|IT'S ODD THAT THIS IS SOMEBODY
20101219183604.223|20101219183605.224|CC1|WE REGARD AS THE GREATEST
20101219183605.358|20101219183606.392|CC1|DIPLOMAT OF HIS GENERATION, AS I
20101219183606.526|20101219183608.661|CC1|DO.
20101219183608.794|20101219183610.062|CC1|DOES THAT TELL US THAT ACTUALLY
20101219183610.196|20101219183610.696|CC1|IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR
20101219183610.830|20101219183612.632|CC1|DIPLOMATS TO BE DIPLOMATIC?
20101219183612.765|20101219183613.766|CC1|>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF HENRY
20101219183613.900|20101219183615.468|CC1|KISSINGER WAS DIPLOMATIC, AND HE
20101219183615.601|20101219183617.470|CC1|WAS A GREAT DIPLOMAT.
20101219183617.603|20101219183619.472|CC1|DICK HOLBROOKE WAS RELENTLESS
20101219183619.605|20101219183622.041|CC1|AND CHARMING AND MANIPULATIVE
20101219183622.174|20101219183625.144|CC1|AND BRILLIANT AND STRATEGIC.
20101219183625.277|20101219183625.878|CC1|I THINK THOSE ARE THE QUALITIES
20101219183626.011|20101219183629.381|CC1|OF A GREAT DIPLOMAT.
20101219183629.515|20101219183631.116|CC1|>> YOU WATCHED HIM -- I MEAN,
20101219183631.250|20101219183631.850|CC1|IT'S FAIR TO SAY HE COULD BE A
20101219183631.984|20101219183633.385|CC1|BULLDOZER.
20101219183633.519|20101219183635.087|CC1|>> HE COULD BE A BULLDOZER, BUT
20101219183635.220|20101219183637.056|CC1|WHAT WAS VERY CLEAR WAS THE
20101219183637.189|20101219183639.658|CC1|CANDOR OF HIS IDEAS AND VALUES.
20101219183639.792|20101219183642.194|CC1|SO WHEN HE WAS PUSHING PEOPLE,
20101219183642.327|20101219183642.895|CC1|THEY KNEW THAT IT IS ABOUT AN
20101219183643.028|20101219183644.763|CC1|ISSUE.
20101219183644.897|20101219183647.900|CC1|HE CARED ABOUT CORRUPTION OR HE
20101219183648.033|20101219183649.301|CC1|CARED ABOUT DYING OF INNOCENT
20101219183649.434|20101219183651.870|CC1|PEOPLE, OR HE WAS EXTREMELY

20101219183657.142|20101219183700.112|CC1|AND HE WAS UNFORGIVING IN

20101219183702.280|20101219183702.981|CC1|>> HE'D THROW A FIT IN A GOOD
20101219183703.115|20101219183704.683|CC1|CAUSE?
20101219183704.816|20101219183705.517|CC1|>> HE'D THROW A FIT OR BE
20101219183705.650|20101219183706.418|CC1|RELENTLESS.
20101219183706.551|20101219183708.353|CC1|HE WAS ALWAYS POLITE.
20101219183708.487|20101219183710.922|CC1|I NEVER ONCE SAW HIM RAISE HIS
20101219183711.056|20101219183712.357|CC1|VOICE AT ANYONE, WHETHER IT WAS
20101219183712.491|20101219183712.624|CC1|--
20101219183712.757|20101219183718.296|CC1|>> OH, I DID.
20101219183718.430|20101219183719.397|CC1|>> MAYBE HE MELLOWED BY THE TIME
20101219183719.531|20101219183721.066|CC1|I SAW HIM.
20101219183721.199|20101219183721.800|CC1|BUT HE WAS NEVER INTEMPERATE IN
20101219183721.933|20101219183722.534|CC1|MY PRESENCE WITH ANY LEADER HE
20101219183722.667|20101219183725.370|CC1|DEALT WITH.
20101219183725.503|20101219183726.805|CC1|BUT THEY KNEW HE WAS UNMOVEABLE
20101219183726.938|20101219183728.773|CC1|IN WHAT HE BELIEVED IN AND WHAT
20101219183728.907|20101219183729.908|CC1|HE BELIEVED TO BE IN THE
20101219183730.041|20101219183731.609|CC1|INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES.
20101219183731.743|20101219183732.777|CC1|>> I SAW HIM LOSE HIS TEMPER IN
20101219183732.911|20101219183733.912|CC1|SARAJEVO ONCE.
20101219183734.045|20101219183735.880|CC1|HE HAD JUST NEGOTIATED THE
20101219183736.014|20101219183737.048|CC1|CEASE-FIRE, AND HE MET WITH
20101219183737.182|20101219183738.149|CC1|THESE TWO EUROPEAN GENERALS.
20101219183738.283|20101219183741.019|CC1|THEY WERE GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS
20101219183741.152|20101219183743.288|CC1|LOOKING GENERALS.
20101219183743.421|20101219183744.122|CC1|STRAIGHT OUT OF HOLLYWOOD
20101219183744.255|20101219183745.556|CC1|CENTRAL CASTING.
20101219183745.690|20101219183746.724|CC1|AND FOR THE CEASE-FIRE TO
20101219183746.858|20101219183748.426|CC1|ACTUALLY BE REAL, THEY HAD TO
20101219183748.559|20101219183750.094|CC1|HAVE OPENED THE ONE ROAD INTO
20101219183750.228|20101219183750.962|CC1|SARAJEVO THAT HAD BEEN
20101219183751.095|20101219183752.363|CC1|NEGOTIATED.
20101219183752.497|20101219183754.665|CC1|AND HE BRACED THEM AND SAID, "IS
20101219183754.799|20101219183756.067|CC1|THE ROAD OPEN," AND THEY STARTED
20101219183756.200|20101219183757.768|CC1|TO HEM AND HAW, AND HE SAID,
20101219183757.902|20101219183759.203|CC1|"YOU HAVEN'T OPENED THE ROAD,
20101219183759.337|20101219183800.905|CC1|HAVE YOU?"
20101219183801.038|20101219183804.008|CC1|AND THEY SAID, "WELL," --
20101219183804.141|20101219183807.211|CC1|AND HE LET LOOSE WITH A FULL NEW
20101219183807.345|20101219183809.580|CC1|YORK ON THEM.
20101219183809.714|20101219183813.851|CC1|ONE THING YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
20101219183813.984|20101219183815.953|CC1|WAS RIPD RICHARD WAS AN
20101219183816.086|20101219183817.321|CC1|INVETERATE NEW YORKER.
20101219183817.454|20101219183818.022|CC1|HE UNLOADED ON THEM AND THEY
20101219183818.155|20101219183818.756|CC1|OPENED THE ROAD.
20101219183818.889|20101219183819.924|CC1|>> HE WAS A REAL NEW YORKER, BUT
20101219183820.057|20101219183820.791|CC1|THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING ABOUT
20101219183820.925|20101219183821.592|CC1|HIM THAT I THINK IS SOMETIMES
20101219183821.725|20101219183822.760|CC1|LOST IN FOREIGN POLICY WHICH IS
20101219183822.893|20101219183823.894|CC1|WE HAVE IN WASHINGTON TODAY AT
20101219183824.028|20101219183825.062|CC1|THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT
20101219183825.195|20101219183826.163|CC1|LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY
20101219183826.297|20101219183827.598|CC1|SKILLED IN WASHINGTON, IN THE
20101219183827.731|20101219183829.033|CC1|POLICY DEBATES, THE CORRIDORS OF
20101219183829.166|20101219183829.867|CC1|POWER.
20101219183830.000|20101219183831.568|CC1|BUT RICHARD WAS ROOTED IN
20101219183831.702|20101219183832.970|CC1|KNOWING THE WORLD.
20101219183833.103|20101219183834.104|CC1|HE'D SPENT TIME IN VIETNAM, HE'D
20101219183834.238|20101219183835.272|CC1|SPENT TIME IN MOROCCO.
20101219183835.406|20101219183837.241|CC1|HE LIVED IN GERMANY.
20101219183837.374|20101219183838.375|CC1|AND THAT KIND OF ORGANIC
20101219183838.509|20101219183839.510|CC1|INDUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE
20101219183839.643|20101219183842.079|CC1|WORLD, HE ALWAYS --
20101219183842.212|20101219183843.213|CC1|>> HE WAS IN AFGHANISTAN AS A
20101219183843.347|20101219183844.381|CC1|PRIVATE CITIZEN FOR YEARS BEFORE
20101219183844.515|20101219183845.482|CC1|HE GOT THIS LAST JOB.
20101219183845.616|20101219183848.051|CC1|>> RIGHT.
20101219183848.185|20101219183848.919|CC1|>> I THINK THAT'S THE KEY TO
20101219183849.052|20101219183850.921|CC1|UNDERSTANDING HIS INCREDIBLE
20101219183851.054|20101219183851.755|CC1|SUCCESS.
20101219183851.888|20101219183853.490|CC1|HE ACTUALLY KNEW ABOUT THE
20101219183853.624|20101219183855.759|CC1|COUNTRIES HE WAS DEALING WITH,
20101219183855.892|20101219183858.028|CC1|IT'S VERY RARE FOR AMERICAN
20101219183858.161|20101219183859.730|CC1|FOREIGN POLICYMAKERS TO KNOW
20101219183859.863|20101219183901.164|CC1|ANYTHING ABOUT THE COUNTRIES
20101219183901.298|20101219183902.866|CC1|THEY'RE DEALING WITH.
20101219183902.999|20101219183904.000|CC1|HE KNEW FOREIGN POLICY AND
20101219183904.134|20101219183905.702|CC1|DIPLOMACY.
20101219183905.836|20101219183906.837|CC1|HE KNEW BUREAUCRATIC POLITICS
20101219183906.970|20101219183909.105|CC1|BACK HOME.
20101219183909.239|20101219183910.807|CC1|HE COULD MANEUVER WITH THE BEST
20101219183910.941|20101219183912.809|CC1|OF THEM TO GET THE KIND OF
20101219183912.943|20101219183913.944|CC1|POLICY HE WANTED, AND CRITICALLY
20101219183914.077|20101219183916.479|CC1|HE UNDERSTOOD AMERICAN POLITICS
20101219183916.613|20101219183918.481|CC1|PER SE.
20101219183918.615|20101219183919.916|CC1|AND THAT'S THE SORT OF GROUND
20101219183920.050|20101219183921.051|CC1|BASIS FOR BEING ABLE TO DO
20101219183921.184|20101219183922.185|CC1|THINGS.
20101219183922.318|20101219183923.353|CC1|>> FOURTH DIMENSION, THOUGH, HE
20101219183923.486|20101219183924.187|CC1|ALSO UNDERSTOOD HISTORY.
20101219183924.320|20101219183925.021|CC1|I MEAN, THIS IS A GUY WHO LIVED
20101219183925.155|20101219183926.756|CC1|IN HISTORY.
20101219183926.890|20101219183927.590|CC1|WHICH IS WHY HE WAS SUCH A GREAT
20101219183927.724|20101219183928.758|CC1|SOURCE.
20101219183928.892|20101219183929.859|CC1|HE WOULD ALWAYS GIVE YOU A
20101219183929.993|20101219183931.027|CC1|HISTORIC ANALOGY OR GIVE YOU THE
20101219183931.160|20101219183932.128|CC1|HISTORY OF THE SITUATION.
20101219183932.262|20101219183933.596|CC1|THAT WAS PART OF IT.
20101219183933.730|20101219183937.300|CC1|BUT WHEN YOU ASKED BEFORE ABOUT
20101219183937.433|20101219183938.701|CC1|WHAT MADE HIM A GREAT DIPLOMAT,
20101219183938.835|20101219183940.136|CC1|I HAD THE INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE
20101219183940.269|20101219183942.105|CC1|THAT HE GAVE ME OF TRAVELING
20101219183942.238|20101219183943.506|CC1|WITH HIM ON THE SHUTTLE
20101219183943.639|20101219183944.373|CC1|DIPLOMACY.
20101219183944.507|20101219183945.508|CC1|ON A VERY SMALL PLANE WHERE THEY
20101219183945.641|20101219183946.375|CC1|-- YOU KNOW, I HAD TO BE PART OF
20101219183946.509|20101219183947.477|CC1|EVERY CONVERSATION.
20101219183947.610|20101219183951.214|CC1|>> THIS IS WHEN?
20101219183951.347|20101219183952.348|CC1|>> THIS WAS DURING BOSNIA.
20101219183952.481|20101219183953.482|CC1|AND EACH DAY WE WOULD EITHER
20101219183953.616|20101219183954.917|CC1|START IN CROATIA OR IN SERBIA
20101219183955.051|20101219183955.585|CC1|AND HIT ALL THREE COUNTRIES
20101219183955.718|20101219184000.723|CC1|EVERY DAY.
20101219184000.856|20101219184003.526|CC1|AND THE REMARKABLE THING, TO ME,
20101219184003.659|20101219184006.095|CC1|ABOUT THAT WAS THAT THERE WAS NO
20101219184006.228|20101219184007.897|CC1|FORMAL PREP FOR HIM GOING INTO
20101219184008.030|20101219184009.398|CC1|ANY GIVEN SESSION.
20101219184009.532|20101219184010.266|CC1|HE WAS -- HE DID MOST OF THIS
20101219184010.399|20101219184011.967|CC1|JUST OUT OF HIS HEAD.
20101219184012.101|20101219184013.669|CC1|HIS MILITARY AIDE AT THE TIME,
20101219184013.802|20101219184015.104|CC1|GENERAL WES CLARK, SAID TO ME,
20101219184015.237|20101219184016.238|CC1|"HE'S A JAZZ MUSICIAN, HE
20101219184016.372|20101219184018.240|CC1|IMPROVISES, I DON'T THINK HOW
20101219184018.374|20101219184019.141|CC1|THIS HAPPENS, BUT HE MAKES IT
20101219184019.275|20101219184020.476|CC1|WORK."
20101219184020.609|20101219184022.211|CC1|AND THE REASON HE COULD MAKE IT
20101219184022.344|20101219184023.612|CC1|WORK IS BECAUSE HE HAD ALL OF
20101219184023.746|20101219184025.614|CC1|THE DIMENSIONS THAT LES JUST
20101219184025.748|20101219184027.349|CC1|MENTIONED, AND THE HISTORIC
20101219184027.483|20101219184029.585|CC1|DIMENSION VERY MUCH IN HIS MIND
20101219184029.718|20101219184030.719|CC1|AND IN HIS GRASP.
20101219184030.853|20101219184032.421|CC1|>> WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
20101219184032.554|20101219184034.123|CC1|THE BOSNIAN PEACE, OF THE DAYTON
20101219184034.256|20101219184039.628|CC1|ACCORDS WHEN PEOPLE LISTENING,
20101219184039.761|20101219184041.964|CC1|WHO DIDN'T LIVE THROUGH IT, WHY
20101219184042.097|20101219184042.898|CC1|WAS IT IMPORTANT?
20101219184043.031|20101219184043.732|CC1|>> IT REALLY WAS IMPORTANT.
20101219184043.865|20101219184044.600|CC1|COLD WAR WAS OVER, AND TO A LOT
20101219184044.733|20101219184045.434|CC1|OF AMERICANS, THAT MEANT FOREIGN
20101219184045.567|20101219184046.868|CC1|POLICY WAS OVER.
20101219184047.002|20101219184047.703|CC1|WE DIDN'T HAVE TO BOTHER WITH
20101219184047.836|20101219184051.139|CC1|THE WORLD ANYMORE.
20101219184051.273|20101219184052.240|CC1|AND THEN VERY QUICKLY THE WORLD
20101219184052.374|20101219184053.141|CC1|FIGURED OUT A NEW WAY OF KILLING
20101219184053.275|20101219184055.110|CC1|PEOPLE.
20101219184055.243|20101219184101.883|CC1|THE CLEANSING BUSINESS.
20101219184102.017|20101219184102.617|CC1|AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BECOME
20101219184102.751|20101219184103.285|CC1|AN EPIDEMIC.
20101219184103.418|20101219184103.985|CC1|AT FIRST THE EUROPEANS TURNED
20101219184104.119|20101219184105.020|CC1|AWAY FROM IT COMPLETELY, THEY
20101219184105.153|20101219184106.121|CC1|DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY PART OF
20101219184106.254|20101219184106.988|CC1|IT.
20101219184107.122|20101219184109.524|CC1|AND THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION

20101219184801.497|20101219184803.299|CC1|SO HE SAID, I'M NOT SEEING THIS
20101219184803.432|20101219184804.133|CC1|GUY ANYMORE.
20101219184804.266|20101219184805.401|CC1|HERE WAS THE CRITICAL DECISION.
20101219184805.534|20101219184806.569|CC1|AND BASICALLY THE WHITE HOUSE
20101219184806.702|20101219184808.070|CC1|SAID, WELL, HAVE AMBASSADOR
20101219184808.204|20101219184809.371|CC1|HOLBROOKE STAY AWAY FROM HIM,
20101219184809.505|20101219184810.439|CC1|FOR A WHILE.
20101219184810.573|20101219184812.107|CC1|WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE SAID TO
20101219184812.241|20101219184813.375|CC1|KARZAI, IF YOU DON'T SEE HIM,
20101219184813.509|20101219184815.511|CC1|YOU DON'T SEE ANYBODY.
20101219184815.644|20101219184817.579|CC1|AND IT WAS, I THINK, A TURNING
20101219184817.713|20101219184820.716|CC1|POINT IN KARZAI'S MIND, AS TO
20101219184820.849|20101219184821.450|CC1|WHETHER OR NOT HE COULD CONTROL
20101219184821.583|20101219184822.184|CC1|THE RELATIONSHIP OR WASHINGTON
20101219184822.317|20101219184824.019|CC1|WOULD.
20101219184824.153|20101219184825.154|CC1|>> DO YOU THINK THAT THE WHITE
20101219184825.287|20101219184828.357|CC1|HOUSE SHOWED ITSELF TO BE WEAK
20101219184828.490|20101219184828.824|CC1|AT THAT MOMENT?
20101219184828.957|20101219184830.459|CC1|>> I THINK IT SHOWED ITSELF TO
20101219184830.592|20101219184831.894|CC1|BE VERY INEXPERIENCED.
20101219184832.027|20101219184834.429|CC1|>> VALI, WHEN HOLBROOKE FRAMED
20101219184834.563|20101219184836.198|CC1|THE PROBLEM IN AFGHANISTAN AND
20101219184836.331|20101219184838.033|CC1|PAKISTAN, WHAT DID HE SEE AS THE
20101219184838.166|20101219184840.435|CC1|CENTRAL CHALLENGE?
20101219184840.569|20101219184841.970|CC1|>> WELL, HE SAW THE SECURITY
20101219184842.104|20101219184846.375|CC1|CHALLENGE, THE TALIBAN, THE SAFE
20101219184846.508|20101219184848.210|CC1|HAVENS, THE THREAT TO THE UNITED
20101219184848.343|20101219184849.244|CC1|STATES HOMELAND THAT COULD
20101219184849.377|20101219184850.479|CC1|POTENTIALLY COME FROM THERE, BUT
20101219184850.612|20101219184854.416|CC1|HE SAW THIS AS A VERY COMPLEX
20101219184854.549|20101219184856.284|CC1|PICTURE IN WHICH THE MILITARY
20101219184856.418|20101219184857.619|CC1|PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE, BUT
20101219184857.752|20101219184859.721|CC1|THAT YOU HAD TO GET ALL THE
20101219184859.854|20101219184901.389|CC1|PIECES RIGHT AND ALL THE PIECES
20101219184901.523|20101219184903.224|CC1|HAD TO WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER
20101219184903.358|20101219184905.193|CC1|FOR THIS PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED.
20101219184905.327|20101219184906.127|CC1|SO AFGHANISTAN WOULD HAVE TO
20101219184906.261|20101219184907.395|CC1|HAVE A VIABLE GOVERNMENT.
20101219184907.529|20101219184910.265|CC1|IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A VIABLE
20101219184910.398|20101219184910.699|CC1|ECONOMY.
20101219184910.832|20101219184911.700|CC1|PAKISTAN WOULD HAVE TO BE A
20101219184911.833|20101219184912.801|CC1|STABLE COUNTRY AND RELATIONS
20101219184912.934|20101219184915.570|CC1|BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND THE UNITED

20101219184917.205|20101219184918.907|CC1|AND HE WAS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO
20101219184919.040|20101219184920.408|CC1|MAKE ALL OF THESE HAPPEN AT THE
20101219184920.542|20101219184923.278|CC1|SAME TIME, TO PUT THE PIECES
20101219184923.411|20101219184924.679|CC1|TOGETHER AND USE AMERICAN POWER
20101219184924.812|20101219184926.214|CC1|AND INFLUENCE TO CHANGE,
20101219184926.347|20101219184928.683|CC1|ESSENTIALLY, THE DYNAMIC, AND AS
20101219184928.816|20101219184930.285|CC1|JOE SAID, HE DELVED INTO THE
20101219184930.418|20101219184931.853|CC1|HISTORY OF THIS REGION.
20101219184931.986|20101219184935.390|CC1|HE READ ABOUT THE CREATION OF
20101219184935.523|20101219184938.426|CC1|PAKISTAN, HE READ EXTENSIVELY ON
20101219184938.559|20101219184940.294|CC1|U.S./PAKISTAN RELATIONS, ON
20101219184940.428|20101219184943.064|CC1|AFGHANISTAN' HISTORY, HE
20101219184943.197|20101219184944.098|CC1|CONSULTED EXPERTS, THERE WAS NOT
20101219184944.232|20101219184946.000|CC1|A SCHOLAR OF AFGHANISTAN AND
20101219184946.133|20101219184947.001|CC1|PAKISTAN THAT PASSED THROUGH
20101219184947.134|20101219184948.402|CC1|WASHINGTON THAT DID NOT COME TO
20101219184948.536|20101219184949.704|CC1|HIS OFFICE FOR AN HOUR OF
20101219184949.837|20101219184950.104|CC1|DISCUSSION.
20101219184950.238|20101219184952.907|CC1|AND HE BROUGHT ALL OF THESE
20101219184953.040|20101219184954.041|CC1|ELEMENTS IN ORDER TO TRY TO
20101219184954.175|20101219184955.142|CC1|FIGURE OUT, WHAT IS THE SEQUENCE
20101219184955.276|20101219184956.711|CC1|AND THE WAY TO SOLVE THIS.
20101219184956.844|20101219184959.213|CC1|>> I THINK DICK WAS VERY
20101219184959.347|20101219185000.648|CC1|PESSIMISTIC ABOUT AFGHANISTAN
20101219185000.781|20101219185002.283|CC1|AND OUR ABILITY TO DO ANYTHING
20101219185002.416|20101219185002.783|CC1|IN AFGHANISTAN.
20101219185002.917|20101219185003.517|CC1|HE WAS BEFORE HE TOOK THE JOB,
20101219185003.651|20101219185008.556|CC1|HE WAS IN THE JOB.
20101219185008.689|20101219185011.225|CC1|BUT WHAT HE HAD IN HIM WAS THE
20101219185011.358|20101219185013.360|CC1|NOTION THAT HE STILL HAD TO BANG
20101219185013.494|20101219185014.261|CC1|AWAY AT IT.
20101219185014.395|20101219185016.063|CC1|HE STILL HAD TO TRY TO SOLVE THE
20101219185016.196|20101219185017.631|CC1|PROBLEM.
20101219185017.765|20101219185018.065|CC1|WE WERE THERE.
20101219185018.198|20101219185020.067|CC1|WE WEREN'T GOING TO DISAPPEAR.
20101219185020.200|20101219185021.201|CC1|WE WEREN'T GOING TO GET OUT THE
20101219185021.335|20101219185021.969|CC1|NEXT DAY.
20101219185022.102|20101219185025.606|CC1|SO HIS JOB, AS HE SAW IT, WAS TO
20101219185025.739|20101219185027.274|CC1|TRY TO DO -- HATE TO PUT IT THIS
20101219185027.408|20101219185028.776|CC1|WAY -- THE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.
20101219185028.909|20101219185030.444|CC1|>> THAT WAS WHY THE KERFUFFLE
20101219185030.577|20101219185034.615|CC1|THIS WEEK ABOUT HIS LAST WORDS
20101219185034.748|20101219185043.590|CC1|"STOP THE WAR IN
20101219185043.724|20101219185044.291|CC1|YOU KNOW, HE WANTED TO SEE IT
20101219185044.424|20101219185048.595|CC1|DRAWN DOWN.
20101219185048.729|20101219185050.564|CC1|HE UNDERSTOOD IT HAD TO HAVE A
20101219185050.697|20101219185052.265|CC1|DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION AND A
20101219185052.399|20101219185052.999|CC1|REGIONAL SOLUTION RATHER THAN A
20101219185053.133|20101219185054.301|CC1|MILITARY SOLUTION.
20101219185054.434|20101219185055.402|CC1|>> WHAT WAS YOUR SENSE, THOUGH,
20101219185055.535|20101219185056.136|CC1|OF HIS GENERAL FEELING ABOUT THE
20101219185056.269|20101219185056.870|CC1|AFGHANISTAN WAR AND OF PETRAEUS'
20101219185057.003|20101219185057.471|CC1|COUNTERINSURGENCY?
20101219185057.604|20101219185058.171|CC1|YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH
20101219185058.305|20101219185059.039|CC1|BOTH HOLBROOKE AND PETRAEUS.
20101219185059.172|20101219185101.107|CC1|>> HE WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT
20101219185101.241|20101219185101.808|CC1|-- ABOUT THE MILITARY PART OF
20101219185101.942|20101219185104.244|CC1|IT.
20101219185104.377|20101219185105.779|CC1|HE BACKED THE ADDITIONAL 30,000
20101219185105.912|20101219185108.915|CC1|TROOPS BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO
20101219185109.049|20101219185109.916|CC1|STICK WITH HIS BOSS, HILLARY
20101219185110.050|20101219185113.053|CC1|CLINTON.
20101219185113.186|20101219185115.155|CC1|BUT HE WAS -- HE DIDN'T THINK
20101219185115.288|20101219185116.189|CC1|THAT THE MILITARY SOLUTION COULD
20101219185116.322|20101219185118.324|CC1|PROVIDE A LONG-TERM SOLUTION.
20101219185118.458|20101219185121.394|CC1|YOU KNOW, I HAD JUST COME BACK
20101219185121.528|20101219185122.462|CC1|FROM AFGHANISTAN THE DAY THAT
20101219185122.595|20101219185125.064|CC1|RICHARD COLLAPSED.
20101219185125.198|20101219185127.634|CC1|IN FACT, MY FIRST PHONE CALL AS
20101219185127.767|20101219185129.702|CC1|IT OFTEN WAS WAS TO HIM BECAUSE
20101219185129.836|20101219185131.271|CC1|HE WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT I HAD
20101219185131.404|20101219185132.839|CC1|SEEN DOWN IN THE SOUTH WHERE A
20101219185132.972|20101219185133.873|CC1|LOT OF THE MOST INTENSE FIGHTING
20101219185134.007|20101219185134.907|CC1|WAS.
20101219185135.041|20101219185137.010|CC1|AND WHAT I HAD SEEN WAS THIS --
20101219185137.143|20101219185138.044|CC1|THAT PETRAEUS' MILITARY STRATEGY
20101219185138.177|20101219185139.612|CC1|HAD SUCCEEDED.
20101219185139.746|20101219185141.180|CC1|THE TALIBAN HAD BEEN REMOVED
20101219185141.314|20101219185143.783|CC1|FROM THEIR HEARTLAND.
20101219185143.916|20101219185145.351|CC1|BUT THE BIG TEST NOW, RIGHT NOW
20101219185145.485|20101219185147.420|CC1|AND FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, IS
20101219185147.553|20101219185148.988|CC1|TO SEE WHETHER LOCAL AFGHAN
20101219185149.122|20101219185150.556|CC1|GOVERNANCE CAN WIN OVER THE
20101219185150.690|20101219185152.091|CC1|PEOPLE THERE.
20101219185152.225|20101219185153.659|CC1|>> DID YOU THINK THEY COULD?
20101219185153.793|20101219185155.761|CC1|>> I DON'T KNOW.
20101219185155.895|20101219185156.796|CC1|>> NOBODY DOES.
20101219185156.929|20101219185158.331|CC1|THE AFGHAN ARMY IS BETTER TODAY
20101219185158.464|20101219185159.398|CC1|THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO.
20101219185159.532|20101219185200.132|CC1|BUT LET ME ASK YOU -- WE HAVE TO
20101219185200.266|20101219185202.501|CC1|CLOSE.
20101219185202.635|20101219185204.070|CC1|DO YOU THINK ULTIMATELY THE
20101219185204.203|20101219185205.638|CC1|PESSIMISM THAT HOLBROOKE HAD
20101219185205.771|20101219185207.740|CC1|ABOUT AFGHANISTAN WAS ROOTED IN
20101219185207.873|20101219185209.308|CC1|AFGHANISTAN, OR IS IT STILL THE
20101219185209.442|20101219185211.911|CC1|GHOSTS OF VIETNAM?
20101219185212.044|20101219185213.445|CC1|>> WELL, SURE IT'S THE GHOSTS OF
20101219185213.579|20101219185217.082|CC1|VIETNAM BECAUSE HERE WE PUT
20101219185217.216|20101219185220.753|CC1|EVERYTHING WE HAD INTO VIETNAM,
20101219185220.886|20101219185221.854|CC1|THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE HAD EVERY
20101219185221.987|20101219185224.390|CC1|INCENTIVE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN
20101219185224.523|20101219185225.958|CC1|FREEDOM, TO FIX THEMSELVES UP
20101219185226.091|20101219185226.692|CC1|BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE
20101219185226.825|20101219185228.027|CC1|TAKEN OVER BY THE NORTH.
20101219185228.160|20101219185232.197|CC1|BUT THEY DIDN'T DO IT.
20101219185232.331|20101219185233.232|CC1|AND I THINK WHAT DICK UNDERSTOOD
20101219185233.365|20101219185234.800|CC1|FROM THAT WAR, WHAT OUR
20101219185234.933|20101219185236.869|CC1|GENERATION UNDERSTOOD FROM IT,
20101219185237.002|20101219185238.437|CC1|WAS THAT AS SOON AS YOU START
20101219185238.570|20101219185240.539|CC1|EXPLAINING EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT
20101219185240.672|20101219185242.608|CC1|COUNTRY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE
20101219185242.741|20101219185244.676|CC1|GOING TO DO, WE, WE, WE, IT
