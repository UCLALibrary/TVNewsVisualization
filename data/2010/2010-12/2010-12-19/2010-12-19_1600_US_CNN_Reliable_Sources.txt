20101219160931.868|20101219160933.269|CC1|BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT GENERATIONAL

20101219160934.104|20101219160936.539|CC1|AND IT'S LESS LEFT-RIGHT AGAIN,
20101219160936.673|20101219160938.308|CC1|IT'S ABOUT TOLERANCE, DIGNITY,

20101219161020.583|20101219161021.684|CC1|I USED TO GO TO SCHOOLS.
20101219161021.818|20101219161024.620|CC1|I USED TO SEE ALL THESE LITTLE

20101219161033.062|20101219161035.131|CC1|>> MAKING SURE THAT THESE KIDS

20101219161037.500|20101219161040.870|CC1|DREAM, LIKE I DID.

20101219161104.460|20101219161106.429|CC1|>> I THINK THE CDC NEEDS TO LOOK
20101219161106.562|20101219161107.797|CC1|INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME
20101219161107.930|20101219161108.164|CC1|INFECTION.

20101219161116.238|20101219161117.707|CC1|>> I AM, I'M A SOFT TOUCH.
20101219161117.840|20101219161119.275|CC1|I THINK FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
20101219161119.408|20101219161123.212|CC1|AND SOMEBODY LIKE JOHN BOEHNER
20101219161123.345|20101219161125.948|CC1|WHO'S BEEN ACUSED OF BEING IN
20101219161126.082|20101219161127.616|CC1|BED WITH LOBBYISTS AND
20101219161127.750|20101219161128.617|CC1|OBSTRUCTIONIST AND THEY'RE NOT
20101219161128.751|20101219161129.151|CC1|HUMAN BEINGS.
20101219161129.285|20101219161130.052|CC1|HERE IS THE SPEAKER OF THE
20101219161130.186|20101219161130.886|CC1|HOUSE, A WEEPER.
20101219161131.020|20101219161131.954|CC1|HE'S IN TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN
20101219161132.087|20101219161132.254|CC1|DREAM.
20101219161132.388|20101219161133.189|CC1|HE'S VERY EMOTIONAL.
20101219161133.322|20101219161135.491|CC1|I THINK IT HUMANIZES HIM.
20101219161135.624|20101219161135.858|CC1|HOWARD --
20101219161135.991|20101219161137.426|CC1|>> HOWARD, COULD I SAY --
20101219161137.560|20101219161138.060|CC1|>> GO AHEAD.
20101219161138.194|20101219161139.795|CC1|>> I THINK -- I'M ALL FOR BIG
20101219161139.929|20101219161143.299|CC1|MEN CRYING.
20101219161143.432|20101219161148.270|CC1|BUT I THINK IT'S A DISTRACTION
20101219161148.404|20101219161150.306|CC1|FROM JOHN BOEHNER'S POLICIES
20101219161150.439|20101219161151.640|CC1|THAT MAKE ME WANT TO CRY.
20101219161151.774|20101219161153.842|CC1|IN THIS MAN'S 20 YEARS IN
20101219161153.976|20101219161154.877|CC1|CONGRESS IS HARD-HEARTED WHEN HE
20101219161155.010|20101219161156.478|CC1|THINKS WHAT HE DOES FOR THOSE
20101219161156.612|20101219161157.713|CC1|KIDS HE WEEPS ABOUT.
20101219161157.846|20101219161159.448|CC1|I THINK WE KEEP FOCUSED ON HIS
20101219161159.581|20101219161200.482|CC1|POLITICS AND WHERE HE TAKES THE
20101219161200.616|20101219161201.917|CC1|COUNTRY AND I WILL RESTRAIN
20101219161202.051|20101219161202.885|CC1|MYSELF FROM WEEPING ON YOUR SHOW
20101219161203.018|20101219161203.352|CC1|THIS MORNING.
20101219161203.485|20101219161204.586|CC1|>> I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.
20101219161204.720|20101219161205.988|CC1|WE ARE GETTING TO KNOW THE NEW
20101219161206.121|20101219161206.555|CC1|SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.
20101219161206.689|20101219161207.322|CC1|I DON'T THINK HE WAS COVERED
20101219161207.456|20101219161208.557|CC1|ENOUGH WHEN HE WAS THE HOUSE
20101219161208.690|20101219161209.358|CC1|MINORITY LEADER.
20101219161209.491|20101219161210.759|CC1|BRIEFLY, ALEX, THERE'S BEEN A
20101219161210.893|20101219161212.795|CC1|LOT OF CHATTER ABOUT IF NANCY
20101219161212.928|20101219161215.164|CC1|PELOSI HAD CRIED AND WHEN WOMEN
20101219161215.297|20101219161216.498|CC1|CRY, THEY GET A MUCH HARDER TIME
20101219161216.632|20101219161217.299|CC1|FROM THE PRESS.
20101219161217.433|20101219161217.933|CC1|DO YOU BUY THAT?
20101219161218.066|20101219161218.434|CC1|>> YEAH.
20101219161218.567|20101219161218.801|CC1|OF COURSE.
20101219161218.934|20101219161220.736|CC1|I THINK THAT THERE IS A DOUBLE
20101219161220.869|20101219161221.103|CC1|STANDARD.
20101219161221.236|20101219161221.937|CC1|BUT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT
20101219161222.070|20101219161224.640|CC1|WOMEN ARE GOING TO LET THEIR
20101219161224.773|20101219161228.644|CC1|EMOTIONS RULE THEIR REHEADS.
20101219161228.777|20101219161230.779|CC1|WHEN THAT'S GLEEFULLY OVERTURNED
20101219161230.913|20101219161232.047|CC1|BY A MAN CRYING AND HAVING HIS
20101219161232.180|20101219161233.215|CC1|HEART AT THE FOREFRONT, I THINK

20101219164919.600|20101219164920.634|CC1|AND THE INDIVIDUAL USER OF

20101219164923.304|20101219164925.105|CC1|I MEAN, THE MOST AMAZING STORY
20101219164925.239|20101219164927.308|CC1|FROM MY POINT OF VIEW WAS WHEN
20101219164927.441|20101219164928.776|CC1|THE U.K. LAST YEAR APPOINTED A
20101219164928.909|20101219164931.245|CC1|NEW HEAD OF ITS SECRET

20101219164937.952|20101219164938.552|CC1|MADE THEM PUBLIC.

20101219164950.264|20101219164950.564|CC1|THEY'RE DOING.
20101219164950.697|20101219164951.498|CC1|FACEBOOK IS A NEW MEDIUM AND
20101219164951.632|20101219164953.367|CC1|PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT.
20101219164953.500|20101219164956.003|CC1|BUT IF IT'S PUBLIC DATA, I THINK
20101219164956.136|20101219164957.037|CC1|JOURNALISTS DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO
20101219164957.171|20101219164958.105|CC1|USE IT WITHOUT PERMISSION
20101219164958.238|20101219164958.939|CC1|BECAUSE IT IS PUBLIC.
20101219164959.072|20101219164959.706|CC1|THAT'S WHAT PUBLIC MEANS.
20101219164959.840|20101219165001.408|CC1|BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CASES THAT
20101219165001.541|20101219165003.243|CC1|WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

20101219165008.715|20101219165010.384|CC1|BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS, THEY
