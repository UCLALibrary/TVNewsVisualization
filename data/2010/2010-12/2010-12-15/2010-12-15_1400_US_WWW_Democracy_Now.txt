20101215140039.437|20101215140041.381|TR0|been detained since last week, 
20101215140041.381|20101215140043.324|TR0|when he was arrested in London 
20101215140043.324|20101215140045.268|TR0|on an international warrant to 
20101215140045.268|20101215140047.212|TR0|face sexual crime allegations in 
20101215140047.212|20101215140049.156|TR0|Sweden. His arrest came amidst 
20101215140049.156|20101215140051.099|TR0|an international uproar over 
20101215140051.099|20101215140053.043|TR0|WikiLeaks' most recent 
20101215140053.043|20101215140054.987|TR0|publication of a massive trove

20101215140058.874|20101215140100.818|TR0|Stephens, said Assange could 
20101215140100.818|20101215140102.762|TR0|remain behind bars until a

20101215140124.143|20101215140126.087|TR0|Mr. Assange in jail. This is

20101215141045.883|20101215141047.827|TR0|In Puerto Rico, armed police 
20101215141047.827|20101215141049.771|TR0|have occupied the main campus of 
20101215141049.771|20101215141051.715|TR0|the University of Puerto Rico in 
20101215141051.715|20101215141053.658|TR0|San Juan following the end of a 
20101215141053.658|20101215141055.602|TR0|two-day student strike. Puerto 
20101215141055.602|20101215141057.546|TR0|Rican officials say the officers 
20101215141057.546|20101215141059.490|TR0|will remain indefinitely to

20101215141101.433|20101215141103.377|TR0|attend classes. The strike was 
20101215141103.377|20101215141105.321|TR0|called in protest of a tuition

20101215141111.152|20101215141113.096|TR0|a militarization of campus and a

20101215141122.814|20101215141124.758|TR0|founder Julian Assange is still 
20101215141124.758|20101215141126.702|TR0|in jail in London. On Tuesday, a 
20101215141126.702|20101215141128.646|TR0|British court granted Assange 
20101215141128.646|20101215141130.589|TR0|bail but then forced him to 
20101215141130.589|20101215141132.533|TR0|remain in prison after Swedish 
20101215141132.533|20101215141134.477|TR0|authorities decided to challenge 
20101215141134.477|20101215141136.421|TR0|the decision. Assange has been 
20101215141136.421|20101215141138.364|TR0|detained since last week, when 
20101215141138.364|20101215141140.308|TR0|he was arrested in London on an 
20101215141140.308|20101215141142.252|TR0|international warrant to face 
20101215141142.252|20101215141144.196|TR0|sex crimes allegations in 
20101215141144.196|20101215141146.139|TR0|Sweden. His arrest came amidst 
20101215141146.139|20101215141148.083|TR0|an international uproar over 
20101215141148.083|20101215141150.027|TR0|WikiLeaks' most recent 
20101215141150.027|20101215141151.971|TR0|publication of a massive trove 
20101215141151.971|20101215141153.914|TR0|of secret U.S. diplomatic cables.

20101215141157.802|20101215141159.746|TR0|Tuesday, Assange's supporters 
20101215141159.746|20101215141201.689|TR0|broke out in cheers when the 
20101215141201.689|20101215141203.633|TR0|London judge granted Assange 
20101215141203.633|20101215141205.577|TR0|bail. But when the counsel for 
20101215141205.577|20101215141207.520|TR0|the prosecution indicated it 
20101215141207.520|20101215141209.464|TR0|would appeal, the judge told 
20101215141209.464|20101215141211.408|TR0|Assange he would remain in jail 
20101215141211.408|20101215141213.352|TR0|until a hearing at a higher 
20101215141213.352|20101215141215.295|TR0|court within 48 hours. If he 
20101215141215.295|20101215141217.239|TR0|wins that appeal, Assange will 
20101215141217.239|20101215141219.183|TR0|still have to raise 200,000 
20101215141219.183|20101215141221.127|TR0|pounds sterling - more than 
20101215141221.127|20101215141223.070|TR0|$300,000 - in bail money. He 
20101215141223.070|20101215141225.014|TR0|would also be subject to a 
20101215141225.014|20101215141226.958|TR0|curfew, be forced to wear an 
20101215141226.958|20101215141228.902|TR0|electronic tag, and report to a 
20101215141228.902|20101215141230.845|TR0|nearby police station every 
20101215141230.845|20101215141232.789|TR0|evening until his next court

20101215141236.677|20101215141238.620|TR0|Before Tuesday's hearing, 
20101215141238.620|20101215141240.564|TR0|Assange remained defiant, 
20101215141240.564|20101215141242.508|TR0|telling his mother, Christine, 
20101215141242.508|20101215141244.452|TR0|from his cell he was committed 
20101215141244.452|20101215141246.395|TR0|to publishing more secret U.S. 
20101215141246.395|20101215141248.339|TR0|cables. In a written statement 
20101215141248.339|20101215141250.283|TR0|of his comments supplied to 
20101215141250.283|20101215141252.226|TR0|Australia's Network Seven by his 
20101215141252.226|20101215141254.170|TR0|mother, Assange said, quote, "My 
20101215141254.170|20101215141256.114|TR0|convictions are unfaltering. I 
20101215141256.114|20101215141258.058|TR0|remain true to the ideals I have 
20101215141258.058|20101215141300.001|TR0|expressed. This circumstance 
20101215141300.001|20101215141301.945|TR0|shall not shake them."

20101215141303.889|20101215141305.833|TR0|Several of Julian Assange's

20101215141402.201|20101215141404.145|TR0|

20101215141421.638|20101215141423.582|TR0|represented how people feel 
20101215141423.582|20101215141425.526|TR0|about this. People are 
20101215141425.526|20101215141427.470|TR0|overwhelmingly angry and 
20101215141427.470|20101215141429.413|TR0|overwhelmingly supportive of 
20101215141429.413|20101215141431.357|TR0|Julian Assange and of WikiLeaks. 
20101215141431.357|20101215141433.301|TR0|They have no difficulty seeing 
20101215141433.301|20101215141435.245|TR0|the injustice, the injustice 
20101215141435.245|20101215141437.188|TR0|that has been perpetrated in 
20101215141437.188|20101215141439.132|TR0|this rather absurd case in 
20101215141439.132|20101215141441.076|TR0|Sweden, but also the importance 
20101215141441.076|20101215141443.020|TR0|of Julian Assange's WikiLeaks 
20101215141443.020|20101215141444.963|TR0|organization in allowing us to 
20101215141444.963|20101215141446.907|TR0|get a glimpse of how the world 
20101215141446.907|20101215141448.851|TR0|is really run, how and why 
20101215141448.851|20101215141450.795|TR0|politicians lie to us. I think 
20101215141450.795|20101215141452.738|TR0|it's - in all my career as a 
20101215141452.738|20101215141454.682|TR0|journalist, I've never known 
20101215141454.682|20101215141456.626|TR0|anything like it. I think we're 
20101215141456.626|20101215141458.570|TR0|seeing a great awakening, and 
20101215141458.570|20101215141500.513|TR0|WikiLeaks has been the catalyst 
20101215141500.513|20101215141502.457|TR0|for that. And that was very much 
20101215141502.457|20101215141504.401|TR0|demonstrated outside the court 
20101215141504.401|20101215141506.344|TR0|yesterday.
20101215141506.344|20101215141508.288|TR0|

20101215141510.232|20101215141512.176|TR0|maybe for people around the 
20101215141512.176|20101215141514.119|TR0|world who are watching and 
20101215141514.119|20101215141516.063|TR0|listening to this right now, you 
20101215141516.063|20101215141518.007|TR0|can explain what exactly 
20101215141518.007|20101215141519.951|TR0|happened in the courtroom, the 
20101215141519.951|20101215141521.894|TR0|fact that Julian Assange has 
20101215141521.894|20101215141523.838|TR0|been held for more than a week 
20101215141523.838|20101215141525.782|TR0|in prison and has not been 
20101215141525.782|20101215141527.726|TR0|charged with a crime. Explain 
20101215141527.726|20101215141529.669|TR0|how we have come to this point.
20101215141529.669|20101215141531.613|TR0|
20101215141531.613|20101215141533.557|TR0|>> MARK STEPHENS: Well, it's a 
20101215141533.557|20101215141535.501|TR0|slightly bizarre situation. He's 
20101215141535.501|20101215141537.444|TR0|wanted for questioning in 
20101215141537.444|20101215141539.388|TR0|Sweden. He's already had one 
20101215141539.388|20101215141541.332|TR0|interview with the Swedish 
20101215141541.332|20101215141543.276|TR0|prosecutor. He's wanted for 
20101215141543.276|20101215141545.219|TR0|another interview. The Swedish 
20101215141545.219|20101215141547.163|TR0|prosecutor has refused to tell 
20101215141547.163|20101215141549.107|TR0|him what she wants to interview

20101215141551.050|20101215141552.994|TR0|nature of the allegations. So, 
20101215141552.994|20101215141554.938|TR0|really, what we're talking about 
20101215141554.938|20101215141556.882|TR0|now is an extradition warrant, 
20101215141556.882|20101215141558.825|TR0|which they've now issued. And 
20101215141558.825|20101215141600.769|TR0|so, the question on the 
20101215141600.769|20101215141602.713|TR0|extradition warrant is, should 
20101215141602.713|20101215141604.657|TR0|he serve his time in prison 
20101215141604.657|20101215141606.600|TR0|while the decision about 
20101215141606.600|20101215141608.544|TR0|extradition is being made, or 
20101215141608.544|20101215141610.488|TR0|should - as the Swedes would 
20101215141610.488|20101215141612.432|TR0|have it, should he be sitting in 
20101215141612.432|20101215141614.375|TR0|jail, Scrooge-like, over 
20101215141614.375|20101215141616.319|TR0|Christmas? Now, the problem 
20101215141616.319|20101215141618.263|TR0|we've got is that the Swedes 
20101215141618.263|20101215141620.207|TR0|seem dead set to try and keep 
20101215141620.207|20101215141622.150|TR0|him in jail.

20101215141624.094|20101215141626.038|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Explain what the 
20101215141626.038|20101215141627.982|TR0|Interpol red - what red flag is, 
20101215141627.982|20101215141629.925|TR0|what exactly the Swedes are 
20101215141629.925|20101215141631.869|TR0|saying he has done and they want 
20101215141631.869|20101215141633.813|TR0|him for, and what it means for 
20101215141633.813|20101215141635.756|TR0|him to be extradited to Sweden, 
20101215141635.756|20101215141637.700|TR0|if that's what's going to happen.
20101215141637.700|20101215141639.644|TR0|
20101215141639.644|20101215141641.588|TR0|>> MARK STEPHENS: OK. An 
20101215141641.588|20101215141643.531|TR0|Interpol red notice is a notice 
20101215141643.531|20101215141645.475|TR0|sent out, usually secretly, but 
20101215141645.475|20101215141647.419|TR0|very bizarrely in this case it's 
20101215141647.419|20101215141649.363|TR0|been made public, which allows 
20101215141649.363|20101215141651.306|TR0|the authorities of each state to 
20101215141651.306|20101215141653.250|TR0|notify Sweden every time he 
20101215141653.250|20101215141655.194|TR0|crosses a port or enters or 
20101215141655.194|20101215141657.138|TR0|leaves a country. The matter 
20101215141657.138|20101215141659.081|TR0|that he's wanted for is a sexual 
20101215141659.081|20101215141701.025|TR0|misdemeanor, a series of 
20101215141701.025|20101215141702.969|TR0|offenses in Sweden. He isn't 
20101215141702.969|20101215141704.913|TR0|charged with that. And the 
20101215141704.913|20101215141706.856|TR0|Swedish lawyers tell me that 
20101215141706.856|20101215141708.800|TR0|even if he were convicted, he 
20101215141708.800|20101215141710.744|TR0|wouldn't go to jail. So we're in 
20101215141710.744|20101215141712.688|TR0|this rather bonkers position 
20101215141712.688|20101215141714.631|TR0|where the Swedish lawyers tell 
20101215141714.631|20101215141716.575|TR0|us he wouldn't go to jail, yet 
20101215141716.575|20101215141718.519|TR0|on an extradition warrant, he's 
20101215141718.519|20101215141720.462|TR0|being held in custody. And as 
20101215141720.462|20101215141722.406|TR0|you said at the top, Amy, they 
20101215141722.406|20101215141724.350|TR0|are some onerous conditions. 
20101215141724.350|20101215141726.294|TR0|He's effectively under house 
20101215141726.294|20101215141728.237|TR0|arrest - or, as we said in court 
20101215141728.237|20101215141730.181|TR0|yesterday, mansion arrest - 
20101215141730.181|20101215141732.125|TR0|because he will be put up in a 
20101215141732.125|20101215141734.069|TR0|600-acre estate, a 10-bedroom 
20101215141734.069|20101215141736.012|TR0|mansion near London.
20101215141736.012|20101215141737.956|TR0|
20101215141737.956|20101215141739.900|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you explain 
20101215141739.900|20101215141741.844|TR0|what is happening, that you 
20101215141741.844|20101215141743.787|TR0|understand is happening, here in 
20101215141743.787|20101215141745.731|TR0|the United States in Virginia? 
20101215141745.731|20101215141747.675|TR0|So he is being wanted for 
20101215141747.675|20101215141749.619|TR0|questioning about sex crimes in 
20101215141749.619|20101215141751.562|TR0|Sweden, but then the United 
20101215141751.562|20101215141753.506|TR0|States, the Attorney General 
20101215141753.506|20101215141755.450|TR0|Eric Holder, has said something 
20101215141755.450|20101215141757.394|TR0|else.
20101215141757.394|20101215141759.337|TR0|
20101215141759.337|20101215141801.281|TR0|>> MARK STEPHENS: Excuse me, 
20101215141801.281|20101215141803.225|TR0|yes. A bit of a cough.
20101215141803.225|20101215141805.168|TR0|
20101215141805.168|20101215141807.112|TR0|The position is that - the word 
20101215141807.112|20101215141809.056|TR0|swirling around the elites in 
20101215141809.056|20101215141811.000|TR0|Stockholm is that the Americans 
20101215141811.000|20101215141812.943|TR0|are effectively using this as a 
20101215141812.943|20101215141814.887|TR0|holding charge. A holding 
20101215141814.887|20101215141816.831|TR0|charge, as you'll know, is a 
20101215141816.831|20101215141818.775|TR0|charge that people have no 
20101215141818.775|20101215141820.718|TR0|intention of prosecuting, 
20101215141820.718|20101215141822.662|TR0|because it's meritless, or that 
20101215141822.662|20101215141824.606|TR0|it's such a minor offense that 
20101215141824.606|20101215141826.550|TR0|actually the big sucker punch is 
20101215141826.550|20101215141828.493|TR0|coming, and we haven't yet seen 
20101215141828.493|20101215141830.437|TR0|that. And the word in Stockholm 
20101215141830.437|20101215141832.381|TR0|is that there is a secret grand 
20101215141832.381|20101215141834.325|TR0|jury empaneled in Alexandria 
20101215141834.325|20101215141836.268|TR0|just near the Pentagon and that 
20101215141836.268|20101215141838.212|TR0|they are considering how they 
20101215141838.212|20101215141840.156|TR0|might get Julian Assange on 
20101215141840.156|20101215141842.100|TR0|criminal charges in the United 
20101215141842.100|20101215141844.043|TR0|States. Now, the United States 
20101215141844.043|20101215141845.987|TR0|authorities have flatly denied 
20101215141845.987|20101215141847.931|TR0|that. Now, if that's true, then 
20101215141847.931|20101215141849.874|TR0|it would be difficult to see how 
20101215141849.874|20101215141851.818|TR0|he could be extradited. And, of 
20101215141851.818|20101215141853.762|TR0|course, as a lawyer, I can't see 
20101215141853.762|20101215141855.706|TR0|that he's committed any offense. 
20101215141855.706|20101215141857.649|TR0|And indeed a congressional 
20101215141857.649|20101215141859.593|TR0|report that came out on the 6th 
20101215141859.593|20101215141901.537|TR0|of December said very much the 
20101215141901.537|20101215141903.481|TR0|same thing. But I'm sure you'll 
20101215141903.481|20101215141905.424|TR0|appreciate, as will viewers, 
20101215141905.424|20101215141907.368|TR0|that he has made some big and 
20101215141907.368|20101215141909.312|TR0|powerful enemies.
20101215141909.312|20101215141911.256|TR0|
20101215141911.256|20101215141913.199|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: A friend of 
20101215141913.199|20101215141915.143|TR0|Julian Assange has told Sky News 
20101215141915.143|20101215141917.087|TR0|he believes that if he is 
20101215141917.087|20101215141919.031|TR0|extradited to Sweden, that he 
20101215141919.031|20101215141920.974|TR0|could be sent to the United 
20101215141920.974|20101215141922.918|TR0|States. Why would it be easier 
20101215141922.918|20101215141924.862|TR0|for him to be sent to the United 
20101215141924.862|20101215141926.806|TR0|States from Sweden than from 
20101215141926.806|20101215141928.749|TR0|Britain, Mark Stephens?
20101215141928.749|20101215141930.693|TR0|
20101215141930.693|20101215141932.637|TR0|>> MARK STEPHENS: That's a very 
20101215141932.637|20101215141934.580|TR0|good question, Amy. And the 
20101215141934.580|20101215141936.524|TR0|answer really is that we do have 
20101215141936.524|20101215141938.468|TR0|extradition arrangements between 
20101215141938.468|20101215141940.412|TR0|the U.K. and the U.S., but the 
20101215141940.412|20101215141942.355|TR0|British judges have a long 
20101215141942.355|20101215141944.299|TR0|history of looking at them 
20101215141944.299|20101215141946.243|TR0|pretty carefully. You'll be 
20101215141946.243|20101215141948.187|TR0|familiar with the case of Gary 
20101215141948.187|20101215141950.130|TR0|McKinnon, the young child that 
20101215141950.130|20101215141952.074|TR0|hacked into the Pentagon 
20101215141952.074|20101215141954.018|TR0|computers, comprehensively 
20101215141954.018|20101215141955.962|TR0|embarrassed them, and he's 
20101215141955.962|20101215141957.905|TR0|wanted on an extradition warrant 
20101215141957.905|20101215141959.849|TR0|to the United States. That's 
20101215141959.849|20101215142001.793|TR0|been being fought for about 
20101215142001.793|20101215142003.737|TR0|three or four years now. And so, 
20101215142003.737|20101215142005.680|TR0|the possibility is that the 
20101215142005.680|20101215142007.624|TR0|British courts would look at 
20101215142007.624|20101215142009.568|TR0|this and scrutinize it in a 
20101215142009.568|20101215142011.512|TR0|thorough and independent way. 
20101215142011.512|20101215142013.455|TR0|That's what British judges are; 
20101215142013.455|20101215142015.399|TR0|they're not politically 
20101215142015.399|20101215142017.343|TR0|influenced. Whereas I think that 
20101215142017.343|20101215142019.286|TR0|it's felt that the Swedes have 
20101215142019.286|20101215142021.230|TR0|perhaps a little more of a soft 
20101215142021.230|20101215142023.174|TR0|touch and perhaps, more fairly, 
20101215142023.174|20101215142025.118|TR0|are less experienced, the 
20101215142025.118|20101215142027.061|TR0|judiciary in Sweden, in dealing 
20101215142027.061|20101215142029.005|TR0|with these extradition warrants, 
20101215142029.005|20101215142030.949|TR0|and perhaps would - it would go 
20101215142030.949|20101215142032.893|TR0|more on the nod from Sweden.

20101215142046.499|20101215142048.443|TR0|That's about $300,000. And, of 
20101215142048.443|20101215142050.386|TR0|course, the problem with that is 
20101215142050.386|20101215142052.330|TR0|that we finished court after

20101215142054.274|20101215142056.218|TR0|so - and getting that kind of 
20101215142056.218|20101215142058.161|TR0|money out of a bank, you'll 
20101215142058.161|20101215142100.105|TR0|realize that most banks don't 
20101215142100.105|20101215142102.049|TR0|carry that kind of money. It's 
20101215142102.049|20101215142103.992|TR0|very modest amounts that they 
20101215142103.992|20101215142105.936|TR0|carry these days, because we 
20101215142105.936|20101215142107.880|TR0|spend most of our money 
20101215142107.880|20101215142109.824|TR0|electronically. And, of course, 
20101215142109.824|20101215142111.767|TR0|he's being electronically 
20101215142111.767|20101215142113.711|TR0|hobbled by Visa and MasterCard, 
20101215142113.711|20101215142115.655|TR0|who have stopped the accounts 
20101215142115.655|20101215142117.599|TR0|being - paying money to 
20101215142117.599|20101215142119.542|TR0|WikiLeaks. And so, actually 
20101215142119.542|20101215142121.486|TR0|gathering that money has meant 
20101215142121.486|20101215142123.430|TR0|that he's had to call on - and 
20101215142123.430|20101215142125.374|TR0|we've had, on his behalf - to 
20101215142125.374|20101215142127.317|TR0|call upon the very generous 
20101215142127.317|20101215142129.261|TR0|friends that he has, very 
20101215142129.261|20101215142131.205|TR0|high-profile individuals. But 
20101215142131.205|20101215142133.149|TR0|even they can't make money move 
20101215142133.149|20101215142135.092|TR0|after banking hours. And, of 
20101215142135.092|20101215142137.036|TR0|course, that's why he was sent 
20101215142137.036|20101215142138.980|TR0|back to Wandsworth Prison, the 
20101215142138.980|20101215142140.924|TR0|very prison that indeed Oscar

20101215142142.867|20101215142144.811|TR0|was held in when he was up for 
20101215142144.811|20101215142146.755|TR0|crimes of a very different 
20101215142146.755|20101215142148.698|TR0|nature.

20101215142152.586|20101215142154.530|TR0|in solitary in prison, Mark

20101215142158.417|20101215142200.361|TR0|>> MARK STEPHENS: Yes, very 
20101215142200.361|20101215142202.305|TR0|unusually. Men who are accused 
20101215142202.305|20101215142204.248|TR0|of rape are usually released on 
20101215142204.248|20101215142206.192|TR0|bail, and they are given bail on 
20101215142206.192|20101215142208.136|TR0|condition they don't contact the 
20101215142208.136|20101215142210.080|TR0|alleged victim. So, to find 
20101215142210.080|20101215142212.023|TR0|someone in prison is unusual 
20101215142212.023|20101215142213.967|TR0|enough. To find conditions as 
20101215142213.967|20101215142215.911|TR0|sort of onerous as these put on 
20101215142215.911|20101215142217.855|TR0|your bail is incredibly unusual. 
20101215142217.855|20101215142219.798|TR0|And to then find that you're put 
20101215142219.798|20101215142221.742|TR0|in prison is even more unusual 
20101215142221.742|20101215142223.686|TR0|still. Yet further in the 
20101215142223.686|20101215142225.629|TR0|unusual stakes is the fact the 
20101215142225.629|20101215142227.573|TR0|he's on a 23-and-a-half-hour 
20101215142227.573|20101215142229.517|TR0|lockdown, although he's a model 
20101215142229.517|20101215142231.461|TR0|prisoner, deprived of access to 
20101215142231.461|20101215142233.404|TR0|television, to current affairs 
20101215142233.404|20101215142235.348|TR0|information, news, newspapers, 
20101215142235.348|20101215142237.292|TR0|magazines and such like. So, he 
20101215142237.292|20101215142239.236|TR0|really is on almost a punishment 
20101215142239.236|20101215142241.179|TR0|regime.

20101215142245.067|20101215142247.011|TR0|interesting. There's a letter 
20101215142247.011|20101215142248.954|TR0|from Women Against Rape, a 
20101215142248.954|20101215142250.898|TR0|British organization, in The 
20101215142250.898|20101215142252.842|TR0|Guardian newspaper in London. 
20101215142252.842|20101215142254.786|TR0|It's written by Katrin Axelsson 
20101215142254.786|20101215142256.729|TR0|in support of Julian Assange. 
20101215142256.729|20101215142258.673|TR0|And it says, "Many women in both 
20101215142258.673|20101215142300.617|TR0|Sweden and Britain will wonder 
20101215142300.617|20101215142302.561|TR0|at the unusual zeal with which 
20101215142302.561|20101215142304.504|TR0|Julian Assange is being pursued 
20101215142304.504|20101215142306.448|TR0|for rape allegations. [...] 
20101215142306.448|20101215142308.392|TR0|Women don't take kindly to our 
20101215142308.392|20101215142310.335|TR0|demand for safety being misused, 
20101215142310.335|20101215142312.279|TR0|while rape continues to be 
20101215142312.279|20101215142314.223|TR0|neglected at best or protected 
20101215142314.223|20101215142316.167|TR0|at worst." This is a feminist 
20101215142316.167|20101215142318.110|TR0|organization in London. Mark 
20101215142318.110|20101215142320.054|TR0|Stephens?

20101215142321.998|20101215142323.942|TR0|>> MARK STEPHENS: I think that 
20101215142323.942|20101215142325.885|TR0|most of us are extremely 
20101215142325.885|20101215142327.829|TR0|troubled about this. And I think 
20101215142327.829|20101215142329.773|TR0|the reason that we're troubled 
20101215142329.773|20101215142331.717|TR0|is that false allegations of sex 
20101215142331.717|20101215142333.660|TR0|crimes are incredibly rare. When 
20101215142333.660|20101215142335.604|TR0|they come along, they stink. 
20101215142335.604|20101215142337.548|TR0|This one utterly reeks. And, of 
20101215142337.548|20101215142339.492|TR0|course, the problem for that, 
20101215142339.492|20101215142341.435|TR0|more widely, is that it 
20101215142341.435|20101215142343.379|TR0|discourages genuine complaints 
20101215142343.379|20101215142345.323|TR0|about rape and sexual 
20101215142345.323|20101215142347.267|TR0|misbehaviors. And, of course, it 
20101215142347.267|20101215142349.210|TR0|demeans the complaints that are 
20101215142349.210|20101215142351.154|TR0|made by women who have genuinely 
20101215142351.154|20101215142353.098|TR0|been abused. And so, any of 
20101215142353.098|20101215142355.041|TR0|those kind of false allegations 
20101215142355.041|20101215142356.985|TR0|really do devalue this. And I'm 
20101215142356.985|20101215142358.929|TR0|not surprised that people like 
20101215142358.929|20101215142400.873|TR0|Naomi Wolf and - in the 
20101215142400.873|20101215142402.816|TR0|Huffington Post and also that 
20101215142402.816|20101215142404.760|TR0|letter in The Guardian are 
20101215142404.760|20101215142406.704|TR0|really concerned about this, 
20101215142406.704|20101215142408.648|TR0|because it is an unusual zeal, 
20101215142408.648|20101215142410.591|TR0|as she says. I would say it's a 
20101215142410.591|20101215142412.535|TR0|vindictive campaign, and one has 
20101215142412.535|20101215142414.479|TR0|to understand why that 
20101215142414.479|20101215142416.423|TR0|vindictive campaign is going on.

20101215142422.254|20101215142424.198|TR0|about in the first questioning 
20101215142424.198|20101215142426.141|TR0|of him? And how is it that he

20101215142428.085|20101215142430.029|TR0|
20101215142430.029|20101215142431.973|TR0|>> MARK STEPHENS: Well, he was 
20101215142431.973|20101215142433.916|TR0|granted bail yesterday by the 
20101215142433.916|20101215142435.860|TR0|judge, albeit on conditions, and 
20101215142435.860|20101215142437.804|TR0|we're now waiting for the 
20101215142437.804|20101215142439.747|TR0|further appeal. The Swedes 
20101215142439.747|20101215142441.691|TR0|really clearly didn't want to 
20101215142441.691|20101215142443.635|TR0|abide by the umpire's decision. 
20101215142443.635|20101215142445.579|TR0|And, of course, we're having 
20101215142445.579|20101215142447.522|TR0|every time to have people who 
20101215142447.522|20101215142449.466|TR0|have been incredibly generous 
20101215142449.466|20101215142451.410|TR0|with their time, people like 
20101215142451.410|20101215142453.354|TR0|John Pilger who have come along, 
20101215142453.354|20101215142455.297|TR0|other high-profile figures like 
20101215142455.297|20101215142457.241|TR0|Bianca Jagger and Jemima Khan, 
20101215142457.241|20101215142459.185|TR0|film director Ken Loach, Hanif 
20101215142459.185|20101215142501.129|TR0|Kureishi, the author. All sorts 
20101215142501.129|20101215142503.072|TR0|of people have come forward, 
20101215142503.072|20101215142505.016|TR0|stepped forward. Some of these 
20101215142505.016|20101215142506.960|TR0|people don't even know him and 
20101215142506.960|20101215142508.904|TR0|have said, "I believe that there 
20101215142508.904|20101215142510.847|TR0|is something really wrong here." 
20101215142510.847|20101215142512.791|TR0|And they've come to right an 
20101215142512.791|20101215142514.735|TR0|injustice. They see an injustice 
20101215142514.735|20101215142516.679|TR0|taking place before their eyes, 
20101215142516.679|20101215142518.622|TR0|and they are stepping up to the 
20101215142518.622|20101215142520.566|TR0|plate to do something about it. 
20101215142520.566|20101215142522.510|TR0|And I have to say, I am in awe 
20101215142522.510|20101215142524.453|TR0|of those people who have behaved 
20101215142524.453|20101215142526.397|TR0|so honorably and so decently.

20101215142624.709|20101215142626.653|TR0|revealed on WikiLeaks about 
20101215142626.653|20101215142628.597|TR0|these so-called endless wars,

20101215142632.484|20101215142634.428|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Looking at 
20101215142634.428|20101215142636.372|TR0|the enormous quantity and 
20101215142636.372|20101215142638.316|TR0|diversity of these military or

20101215142640.259|20101215142642.203|TR0|documents, what I see is a vast, 
20101215142642.203|20101215142644.147|TR0|sprawling estate, what we would 
20101215142644.147|20101215142646.091|TR0|traditionally call the 
20101215142646.091|20101215142648.034|TR0|military-intelligence complex or 
20101215142648.034|20101215142649.978|TR0|military-industrial complex, and 
20101215142649.978|20101215142651.922|TR0|that this sprawling industrial 
20101215142651.922|20101215142653.865|TR0|estate is growing, becoming more 
20101215142653.865|20101215142655.809|TR0|and more secretive, becoming 
20101215142655.809|20101215142657.753|TR0|more and more uncontrolled. This 
20101215142657.753|20101215142659.697|TR0|is not a sophisticated 
20101215142659.697|20101215142701.640|TR0|conspiracy controlled at the 
20101215142701.640|20101215142703.584|TR0|top. This is a vast movement of 
20101215142703.584|20101215142705.528|TR0|self-interest by thousands and 
20101215142705.528|20101215142707.472|TR0|thousands of players, all 
20101215142707.472|20101215142709.415|TR0|working together and against

20101215142715.247|20101215142717.190|TR0|excerpt of the new film that 
20101215142717.190|20101215142719.134|TR0|premiered last night in Britain, 
20101215142719.134|20101215142721.078|TR0|The War You Don't See. John 
20101215142721.078|20101215142723.022|TR0|Pilger, you know Julian Assange. 
20101215142723.022|20101215142724.965|TR0|Talk more about what he's saying 
20101215142724.965|20101215142726.909|TR0|and about the media's coverage 
20101215142726.909|20101215142728.853|TR0|of what WikiLeaks has done, from 
20101215142728.853|20101215142730.797|TR0|the release of the Iraq war logs 
20101215142730.797|20101215142732.740|TR0|to those in Afghanistan to now 
20101215142732.740|20101215142734.684|TR0|this largest trove of U.S. 
20101215142734.684|20101215142736.628|TR0|diplomatic cables ever released 
20101215142736.628|20101215142738.571|TR0|in history, John.
20101215142738.571|20101215142740.515|TR0|
20101215142740.515|20101215142742.459|TR0|>> JOHN PILGER: Well, what 
20101215142742.459|20101215142744.403|TR0|Julian Assange and WikiLeaks is 
20101215142744.403|20101215142746.346|TR0|doing is what journalists should 
20101215142746.346|20101215142748.290|TR0|have been doing. I mean, I think 
20101215142748.290|20101215142750.234|TR0|you mention the reaction to him. 
20101215142750.234|20101215142752.178|TR0|Some of the hostility, 
20101215142752.178|20101215142754.121|TR0|especially in the United States, 
20101215142754.121|20101215142756.065|TR0|from some of those very highly 
20101215142756.065|20101215142758.009|TR0|paid journalists at the top has 
20101215142758.009|20101215142759.953|TR0|been quite instructive, because 
20101215142759.953|20101215142801.896|TR0|I think that they are shamed by 
20101215142801.896|20101215142803.840|TR0|WikiLeaks. They are shamed by 
20101215142803.840|20101215142805.784|TR0|the founder of WikiLeaks, who is 
20101215142805.784|20101215142807.728|TR0|prepared to say that the public 
20101215142807.728|20101215142809.671|TR0|has a right to know the secrets 
20101215142809.671|20101215142811.615|TR0|of governments that impinge on 
20101215142811.615|20101215142813.559|TR0|our democratic rights. WikiLeaks 
20101215142813.559|20101215142815.503|TR0|is doing something very 
20101215142815.503|20101215142817.446|TR0|Jeffersonian. It was Jefferson 
20101215142817.446|20101215142819.390|TR0|who said that information is the 
20101215142819.390|20101215142821.334|TR0|currency of democracy. And here 
20101215142821.334|20101215142823.277|TR0|you have a lot of these famous 
20101215142823.277|20101215142825.221|TR0|journalists in America are 
20101215142825.221|20101215142827.165|TR0|rather looking down their noses, 
20101215142827.165|20101215142829.109|TR0|at best, and saying some quite 
20101215142829.109|20101215142831.052|TR0|defamatory things about Assange 
20101215142831.052|20101215142832.996|TR0|and WikiLeaks, when in fact they 
20101215142832.996|20101215142834.940|TR0|should have been exploiting 
20101215142834.940|20101215142836.884|TR0|their First Amendment privilege 
20101215142836.884|20101215142838.827|TR0|and letting people know just how 
20101215142838.827|20101215142840.771|TR0|government has lied to us, lied 
20101215142840.771|20101215142842.715|TR0|to us in the run-up to the Iraq 
20101215142842.715|20101215142844.659|TR0|war and lied to us in so many 
20101215142844.659|20101215142846.602|TR0|other circumstances. And I think 
20101215142846.602|20101215142848.546|TR0|that's really been the value of 
20101215142848.546|20101215142850.490|TR0|all this. People have been given 
20101215142850.490|20101215142852.434|TR0|a glimpse of how big power 
20101215142852.434|20101215142854.377|TR0|operates. And they're - it's 
20101215142854.377|20101215142856.321|TR0|coming from a facilitator, it's 
20101215142856.321|20101215142858.265|TR0|coming from these very brave 
20101215142858.265|20101215142900.209|TR0|whistleblowers. And in my film, 
20101215142900.209|20101215142902.152|TR0|Julian Assange goes out of his 
20101215142902.152|20101215142904.096|TR0|way to celebrate the people 
20101215142904.096|20101215142906.040|TR0|within the system who he 
20101215142906.040|20101215142907.983|TR0|describes as the equivalent of 
20101215142907.983|20101215142909.927|TR0|conscientious objectors during 
20101215142909.927|20101215142911.871|TR0|the First World War, these 
20101215142911.871|20101215142913.815|TR0|extraordinarily courageous 
20101215142913.815|20101215142915.758|TR0|people who were prepared to 
20101215142915.758|20101215142917.702|TR0|speak out against that 
20101215142917.702|20101215142919.646|TR0|slaughter. All the Bradley 
20101215142919.646|20101215142921.590|TR0|Mannings and others are 
20101215142921.590|20101215142923.533|TR0|absolutely heroic figures. 
20101215142923.533|20101215142925.477|TR0|There's no question about that.
20101215142925.477|20101215142927.421|TR0|
20101215142927.421|20101215142929.365|TR0|In my film, I also went to 
20101215142929.365|20101215142931.308|TR0|Washington, and I interviewed 
20101215142931.308|20101215142933.252|TR0|the Assistant Secretary of 
20101215142933.252|20101215142935.196|TR0|Defense, Bryan Whitman, the man 
20101215142935.196|20101215142937.140|TR0|who's been in charge of media 
20101215142937.140|20101215142939.083|TR0|operations, as they call it, 
20101215142939.083|20101215142941.027|TR0|through a number of 
20101215142941.027|20101215142942.971|TR0|administrations. And I asked him 
20101215142942.971|20101215142944.915|TR0|to give a guarantee that Julian 
20101215142944.915|20101215142946.858|TR0|Assange would not be hunted 
20101215142946.858|20101215142948.802|TR0|down, as the media was 
20101215142948.802|20101215142950.746|TR0|describing it. And he said he 
20101215142950.746|20101215142952.689|TR0|wasn't in a position to give 
20101215142952.689|20101215142954.633|TR0|that guarantee. So, I think 
20101215142954.633|20101215142956.577|TR0|we're in a situation here, Amy, 
20101215142956.577|20101215142958.521|TR0|where people have to speak out. 
20101215142958.521|20101215143000.464|TR0|This is a very fundamental 
20101215143000.464|20101215143002.408|TR0|issue, and the people we need to 
20101215143002.408|20101215143004.352|TR0|speak out most of all are those 
20101215143004.352|20101215143006.296|TR0|with the privilege of the media, 
20101215143006.296|20101215143008.239|TR0|with the privilege of 
20101215143008.239|20101215143010.183|TR0|journalism, because this is 
20101215143010.183|20101215143012.127|TR0|about free information. This is 
20101215143012.127|20101215143014.071|TR0|about letting us know truths 
20101215143014.071|20101215143016.014|TR0|that we have to know about if we 
20101215143016.014|20101215143017.958|TR0|are to live in any form of 
20101215143017.958|20101215143019.902|TR0|democracy.

20101215143129.876|20101215143131.820|TR0|It's gone out to agencies all 
20101215143131.820|20101215143133.764|TR0|over the government. State 
20101215143133.764|20101215143135.708|TR0|Department employees have been 
20101215143135.708|20101215143137.651|TR0|warned, again, not only on their 
20101215143137.651|20101215143139.595|TR0|computers where they're blocked 
20101215143139.595|20101215143141.539|TR0|at work, but at home. People who 
20101215143141.539|20101215143143.483|TR0|have written cables are not 
20101215143143.483|20101215143145.426|TR0|allowed to put in their names to 
20101215143145.426|20101215143147.370|TR0|see if those cables come up. 
20101215143147.370|20101215143149.314|TR0|Graduate schools, like SIPA at 
20101215143149.314|20101215143151.258|TR0|Columbia University, an email 
20101215143151.258|20101215143153.201|TR0|was sent out from the 
20101215143153.201|20101215143155.145|TR0|administration saying the State 
20101215143155.145|20101215143157.089|TR0|Department had contacted them 
20101215143157.089|20101215143159.033|TR0|and that if they care about 
20101215143159.033|20101215143200.976|TR0|their futures in government, 
20101215143200.976|20101215143202.920|TR0|they should not post anything to 
20101215143202.920|20101215143204.864|TR0|Facebook or talk about these

20101215143208.751|20101215143210.695|TR0|And then you have Allen West, 
20101215143210.695|20101215143212.639|TR0|one of the new Republican 
20101215143212.639|20101215143214.582|TR0|Congress members-elect, who 
20101215143214.582|20101215143216.526|TR0|called for targeted news outlets 
20101215143216.526|20101215143218.470|TR0|that publish the cables. In a 
20101215143218.470|20101215143220.414|TR0|radio interview, Congressmember 
20101215143220.414|20101215143222.357|TR0|West - well, 
20101215143222.357|20101215143224.301|TR0|Congressmember-elect West, 
20101215143224.301|20101215143226.245|TR0|called for censoring any news 
20101215143226.245|20101215143228.189|TR0|outlets that run stories based 
20101215143228.189|20101215143230.132|TR0|on the cables' release. This is 
20101215143230.132|20101215143232.076|TR0|what he said.
20101215143232.076|20101215143234.020|TR0|
20101215143234.020|20101215143235.964|TR0|>> ALLEN WEST: Here is an 
20101215143235.964|20101215143237.907|TR0|individual that is not an 
20101215143237.907|20101215143239.851|TR0|American citizen, first and 
20101215143239.851|20101215143241.795|TR0|foremost, for whatever reason, 
20101215143241.795|20101215143243.739|TR0|you know, gotten his hands on 
20101215143243.739|20101215143245.682|TR0|classified American material and 
20101215143245.682|20101215143247.626|TR0|has put it out there in the 
20101215143247.626|20101215143249.570|TR0|public domain. And I think that 
20101215143249.570|20101215143251.513|TR0|we also should be censoring the 
20101215143251.513|20101215143253.457|TR0|American news agencies which 
20101215143253.457|20101215143255.401|TR0|enabled him to be able to do 
20101215143255.401|20101215143257.345|TR0|this and then also supported him 
20101215143257.345|20101215143259.288|TR0|and applauded him for the 
20101215143259.288|20101215143301.232|TR0|efforts. So, that's kind of 
20101215143301.232|20101215143303.176|TR0|aiding and abetting of a serious 
20101215143303.176|20101215143305.120|TR0|crime.

20101215143307.063|20101215143309.007|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And speaking of 
20101215143309.007|20101215143310.951|TR0|crimes, another Congress member, 
20101215143310.951|20101215143312.895|TR0|longtime Congressmember Peter 
20101215143312.895|20101215143314.838|TR0|King from here in New York, has 
20101215143314.838|20101215143316.782|TR0|called for the classifying of 
20101215143316.782|20101215143318.726|TR0|WikiLeaks as a foreign terrorist 
20101215143318.726|20101215143320.670|TR0|organization. I did my column 
20101215143320.670|20101215143322.613|TR0|this week talking about 
20101215143322.613|20101215143324.557|TR0|"'Assangination': From Character 
20101215143324.557|20101215143326.501|TR0|Assassination to the Real Thing" 
20101215143326.501|20101215143328.444|TR0|and the calls of Democratic 
20101215143328.444|20101215143330.388|TR0|consultants like Bob Beckel on 
20101215143330.388|20101215143332.332|TR0|Fox Business News for Julian 
20101215143332.332|20101215143334.276|TR0|Assange to be killed. He said he 
20101215143334.276|20101215143336.219|TR0|doesn't agree with the death 
20101215143336.219|20101215143338.163|TR0|penalty, so he should be 
20101215143338.163|20101215143340.107|TR0|"illegally" killed, maybe taken 
20101215143340.107|20101215143342.051|TR0|out by U.S. special forces. John 
20101215143342.051|20101215143343.994|TR0|Pilger?
20101215143343.994|20101215143345.938|TR0|
20101215143345.938|20101215143347.882|TR0|>> JOHN PILGER: Look, Amy, I 
20101215143347.882|20101215143349.826|TR0|thought you were reading out 
20101215143349.826|20101215143351.769|TR0|there several passages from 
20101215143351.769|20101215143353.713|TR0|1984. I don't think Orwell could 
20101215143353.713|20101215143355.657|TR0|have put it even better than 
20101215143355.657|20101215143357.601|TR0|that. Surely, we mustn't think 
20101215143357.601|20101215143359.544|TR0|these things. I'm thinking it at 
20101215143359.544|20101215143401.488|TR0|the moment. So if I was over 
20101215143401.488|20101215143403.432|TR0|there, I must be guilty of 
20101215143403.432|20101215143405.376|TR0|something, and therefore I 
20101215143405.376|20101215143407.319|TR0|should be illegally taken out.
20101215143407.319|20101215143409.263|TR0|
20101215143409.263|20101215143411.207|TR0|Look, there's always been - as 
20101215143411.207|20101215143413.150|TR0|you know better than I, there's 
20101215143413.150|20101215143415.094|TR0|always been a tension among the 
20101215143415.094|20101215143417.038|TR0|elites in the United States 
20101215143417.038|20101215143418.982|TR0|between those who pay some sort 
20101215143418.982|20101215143420.925|TR0|of homage, lip service, to all 
20101215143420.925|20101215143422.869|TR0|those Georgian gentleman who 
20101215143422.869|20101215143424.813|TR0|passed down those tablets of 
20101215143424.813|20101215143426.757|TR0|good intentions all that long 
20101215143426.757|20101215143428.700|TR0|time ago and a bunch of 
20101215143428.700|20101215143430.644|TR0|lunatics. But they're powerful 
20101215143430.644|20101215143432.588|TR0|lunatics. They're - perhaps 
20101215143432.588|20101215143434.532|TR0|"lunatics" is not quite right. 
20101215143434.532|20101215143436.475|TR0|They're simply totalitarian 
20101215143436.475|20101215143438.419|TR0|people. And up they come in 
20101215143438.419|20101215143440.363|TR0|anything like this. I see - I 
20101215143440.363|20101215143442.307|TR0|read this morning that the U.S. 
20101215143442.307|20101215143444.250|TR0|Air Force has banned anybody 
20101215143444.250|20101215143446.194|TR0|connecting with it from reading 
20101215143446.194|20101215143448.138|TR0|The Guardian. So, everyone is 
20101215143448.138|20101215143450.082|TR0|banned from doing things and 
20101215143450.082|20101215143452.025|TR0|banned from thinking and so on.
20101215143452.025|20101215143453.969|TR0|
20101215143453.969|20101215143455.913|TR0|They won't get away with it. 
20101215143455.913|20101215143457.856|TR0|That's the good news. They are 
20101215143457.856|20101215143459.800|TR0|hyperventilating, and they're 
20101215143459.800|20101215143501.744|TR0|hysterical, and so be it, but 
20101215143501.744|20101215143503.688|TR0|they won't get away with it. 
20101215143503.688|20101215143505.631|TR0|There are now two genuine powers 
20101215143505.631|20101215143507.575|TR0|in the world. We know about U.S. 
20101215143507.575|20101215143509.519|TR0|power. But that great sleeper, 
20101215143509.519|20101215143511.463|TR0|world public opinion, world 
20101215143511.463|20101215143513.406|TR0|decency, if you like, if I'm not 
20101215143513.406|20101215143515.350|TR0|being too romantic about it, is 
20101215143515.350|20101215143517.294|TR0|waking up. And the scenes 
20101215143517.294|20101215143519.238|TR0|outside the court yesterday went 
20101215143519.238|20101215143521.181|TR0|well beyond, I think, just the 
20101215143521.181|20101215143523.125|TR0|WikiLeaks issue. It is something 
20101215143523.125|20101215143525.069|TR0|else. WikiLeaks has triggered 
20101215143525.069|20101215143527.013|TR0|something. And I don't think it 
20101215143527.013|20101215143528.956|TR0|will be the proverbial genie 
20101215143528.956|20101215143530.900|TR0|being stuffed back in the 
20101215143530.900|20101215143532.844|TR0|bottle, either. So, you know, 
20101215143532.844|20101215143534.788|TR0|world opinion is - when it 
20101215143534.788|20101215143536.731|TR0|stirs, when it moves, when it 
20101215143536.731|20101215143538.675|TR0|starts to come together 
20101215143538.675|20101215143540.619|TR0|collectively to do things that 
20101215143540.619|20101215143542.562|TR0|are important to us all, it's a 
20101215143542.562|20101215143544.506|TR0|very formidable opponent to 
20101215143544.506|20101215143546.450|TR0|those totalitarian people who 
20101215143546.450|20101215143548.394|TR0|you've just quoted. So I'm 
20101215143548.394|20101215143550.337|TR0|rather more optimistic.
20101215143550.337|20101215143552.281|TR0|
20101215143552.281|20101215143554.225|TR0|The immediate thing is to free 
20101215143554.225|20101215143556.169|TR0|Julian Assange. And I'm hoping 
20101215143556.169|20101215143558.112|TR0|that will happen tomorrow at the 
20101215143558.112|20101215143600.056|TR0|High Court. I should just add, 
20101215143600.056|20101215143602.000|TR0|you know, Mark Stephens was very 
20101215143602.000|20101215143603.944|TR0|eloquently describing the case. 
20101215143603.944|20101215143605.887|TR0|But, you know, the absurdity of 
20101215143605.887|20101215143607.831|TR0|this case is that a senior 
20101215143607.831|20101215143609.775|TR0|prosecutor in Sweden threw this 
20101215143609.775|20101215143611.719|TR0|thing out. And I've seen her 
20101215143611.719|20101215143613.662|TR0|papers. And she was left - she 
20101215143613.662|20101215143615.606|TR0|leaves us in no doubt there was 
20101215143615.606|20101215143617.550|TR0|absolutely no evidence to 
20101215143617.550|20101215143619.494|TR0|support any of these 
20101215143619.494|20101215143621.437|TR0|misdemeanors or crimes, or 
20101215143621.437|20101215143623.381|TR0|whatever they're meant to be, at 
20101215143623.381|20101215143625.325|TR0|all. It was only the 
20101215143625.325|20101215143627.268|TR0|intervention of this right-wing 
20101215143627.268|20101215143629.212|TR0|politician in Sweden that 
20101215143629.212|20101215143631.156|TR0|reactivated this whole charade. 
20101215143631.156|20101215143633.100|TR0|So, in a way, it is perhaps 
20101215143633.100|20101215143635.043|TR0|symbolic of the kind of 
20101215143635.043|20101215143636.987|TR0|charades, rather lethal 
20101215143636.987|20101215143638.931|TR0|charades, that we've seen on a 
20101215143638.931|20101215143640.875|TR0|much wider scale in relation to 
20101215143640.875|20101215143642.818|TR0|the invasions of Iraq and 
20101215143642.818|20101215143644.762|TR0|Afghanistan and other issues 
20101215143644.762|20101215143646.706|TR0|that have involved the deaths of 
20101215143646.706|20101215143648.650|TR0|literally hundreds of thousands 
20101215143648.650|20101215143650.593|TR0|of people around the world. So, 
20101215143650.593|20101215143652.537|TR0|what we're seeing is a 
20101215143652.537|20101215143654.481|TR0|rebellion. Where it will go, I'm 
20101215143654.481|20101215143656.425|TR0|not quite sure. But it's 
20101215143656.425|20101215143658.368|TR0|certainly started, I can tell 
20101215143658.368|20101215143700.312|TR0|you.

20101215143704.200|20101215143706.143|TR0|like to ask you to stay with us 
20101215143706.143|20101215143708.087|TR0|as we talk about the wars in 
20101215143708.087|20101215143710.031|TR0|Iraq and Afghanistan, as we talk 
20101215143710.031|20101215143711.974|TR0|about the power of the U.S. 
20101215143711.974|20101215143713.918|TR0|government. This week we 
20101215143713.918|20101215143715.862|TR0|reported on the sudden death of 
20101215143715.862|20101215143717.806|TR0|Richard Holbrooke, who has 
20101215143717.806|20101215143719.749|TR0|played such a key role through 
20101215143719.749|20101215143721.693|TR0|four Democratic administrations, 
20101215143721.693|20101215143723.637|TR0|from Vietnam to Yugoslavia, from 
20101215143723.637|20101215143725.581|TR0|Timor to Afghanistan, Pakistan 
20101215143725.581|20101215143727.524|TR0|and Iraq. And we'd like to talk 
20101215143727.524|20101215143729.468|TR0|about his legacy and about U.S. 
20101215143729.468|20101215143731.412|TR0|foreign policy. You have done a 
20101215143731.412|20101215143733.356|TR0|number of documentaries related 
20101215143733.356|20101215143735.299|TR0|to the areas where he worked, 
20101215143735.299|20101215143737.243|TR0|and we're also going to be 
20101215143737.243|20101215143739.187|TR0|joined by Jeremy Scahill.

20101215143741.131|20101215143743.074|TR0|I also want to say, when you 
20101215143743.074|20101215143745.018|TR0|talk about a wave of reaction 
20101215143745.018|20101215143746.962|TR0|against what has happened to 
20101215143746.962|20101215143748.906|TR0|Julian Assange, I mentioned

20101215143756.680|20101215143758.624|TR0|by WikiLeaks, but there has been 
20101215143758.624|20101215143800.568|TR0|a reversal. Clearly, the 
20101215143800.568|20101215143802.512|TR0|administration at Columbia has 
20101215143802.512|20101215143804.455|TR0|been seriously embarrassed, and 
20101215143804.455|20101215143806.399|TR0|the dean there has now issued a 
20101215143806.399|20101215143808.343|TR0|new statement saying that he 
20101215143808.343|20101215143810.287|TR0|encourages the discussion of 
20101215143810.287|20101215143812.230|TR0|issues, wherever those issues

20101215143831.668|20101215143833.612|TR0|died Monday night at the age of

20101215144134.379|20101215144136.323|TR0|about the legacy of Richard 
20101215144136.323|20101215144138.267|TR0|Holbrooke, we're joined by

20101215144215.198|20101215144217.142|TR0|Jeremy, as we're coming out of 
20101215144217.142|20101215144219.085|TR0|this clip of Richard Holbrooke 
20101215144219.085|20101215144221.029|TR0|supporting the Bush 
20101215144221.029|20101215144222.973|TR0|administration's war on Iraq.
20101215144222.973|20101215144224.916|TR0|
20101215144224.916|20101215144226.860|TR0|>> JEREMY SCAHILL: Right. Well, 
20101215144226.860|20101215144228.804|TR0|first of all, I mean, Richard 
20101215144228.804|20101215144230.748|TR0|Holbrooke, probably more than 
20101215144230.748|20101215144232.691|TR0|any U.S. diplomat since Henry 
20101215144232.691|20101215144234.635|TR0|Kissinger - and he cut his 
20101215144234.635|20101215144236.579|TR0|teeth, of course, during the 
20101215144236.579|20101215144238.523|TR0|Vietnam War working under Henry 
20101215144238.523|20101215144240.466|TR0|Kissinger - Richard Holbrooke 
20101215144240.466|20101215144242.410|TR0|has represented the utter 
20101215144242.410|20101215144244.354|TR0|militarization of what is called 
20101215144244.354|20101215144246.298|TR0|U.S. diplomacy. He was also at 
20101215144246.298|20101215144248.241|TR0|the center of the nexus of U.S. 
20101215144248.241|20101215144250.185|TR0|militarists, of aggressive, 
20101215144250.185|20101215144252.129|TR0|hawkish, quote-unquote, 
20101215144252.129|20101215144254.073|TR0|"diplomats," and the elite, 
20101215144254.073|20101215144256.016|TR0|white-shoe media culture. And 
20101215144256.016|20101215144257.960|TR0|that's why you see people like 
20101215144257.960|20101215144259.904|TR0|Joe Klein and others falling 
20101215144259.904|20101215144301.848|TR0|over themselves to engage in 
20101215144301.848|20101215144303.791|TR0|revisionist history about 
20101215144303.791|20101215144305.735|TR0|Richard Holbrooke. They only 
20101215144305.735|20101215144307.679|TR0|tell one part of the story. And 
20101215144307.679|20101215144309.622|TR0|often, in the case of Iraq or 
20101215144309.622|20101215144311.566|TR0|Yugoslavia, they're telling a 
20101215144311.566|20101215144313.510|TR0|very one-sided version of 
20101215144313.510|20101215144315.454|TR0|history that makes Richard 
20101215144315.454|20101215144317.397|TR0|Holbrooke look like something 
20101215144317.397|20101215144319.341|TR0|that he wasn't, and that was a 
20101215144319.341|20101215144321.285|TR0|peacemaker. He was a war maker 
20101215144321.285|20101215144323.229|TR0|and was someone who extended the 
20101215144323.229|20101215144325.172|TR0|tentacles of U.S. foreign policy.
20101215144325.172|20101215144327.116|TR0|
20101215144327.116|20101215144329.060|TR0|Under the Clinton 
20101215144329.060|20101215144331.004|TR0|administration, Holbrooke was 
20101215144331.004|20101215144332.947|TR0|sort of the hammer when it came 
20101215144332.947|20101215144334.891|TR0|to diplomacy, as he's been, in a 
20101215144334.891|20101215144336.835|TR0|way, under President Obama, 
20101215144336.835|20101215144338.779|TR0|though we'll get to that later 
20101215144338.779|20101215144340.722|TR0|with Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
20101215144340.722|20101215144342.666|TR0|Let's remember, when we're 
20101215144342.666|20101215144344.610|TR0|talking about Iraq, Richard 
20101215144344.610|20101215144346.553|TR0|Holbrooke wasn't just speaking 
20101215144346.553|20101215144348.497|TR0|as some pundit when he was 
20101215144348.497|20101215144350.441|TR0|supporting the Bush 
20101215144350.441|20101215144352.385|TR0|administration's lie-laden case 
20101215144352.385|20101215144354.328|TR0|for war in Iraq. He also 
20101215144354.328|20101215144356.272|TR0|promoted the idea that Saddam 
20101215144356.272|20101215144358.216|TR0|posed a threat with weapons of 
20101215144358.216|20101215144400.160|TR0|mass destruction, Richard 
20101215144400.160|20101215144402.103|TR0|Holbrooke. But during the 
20101215144402.103|20101215144404.047|TR0|Clinton administration, there 
20101215144404.047|20101215144405.991|TR0|were the most ruthless economic 
20101215144405.991|20101215144407.935|TR0|sanctions in history imposed by 
20101215144407.935|20101215144409.878|TR0|the Democrats on the government 
20101215144409.878|20101215144411.822|TR0|- or rather, the people - of 
20101215144411.822|20101215144413.766|TR0|Iraq, that just targeted the 
20101215144413.766|20101215144415.710|TR0|civilian population, denied food 
20101215144415.710|20101215144417.653|TR0|and medicine, turned the 
20101215144417.653|20101215144419.597|TR0|hospitals of Iraq - and John 
20101215144419.597|20101215144421.541|TR0|Pilger knows about this better 
20101215144421.541|20101215144423.485|TR0|than anyone, because he did the 
20101215144423.485|20101215144425.428|TR0|definitive film on it - turned 
20101215144425.428|20101215144427.372|TR0|the hospitals of Iraq into death 
20101215144427.372|20101215144429.316|TR0|rows for infants. So, you know, 
20101215144429.316|20101215144431.259|TR0|Richard Holbrooke was part of an 
20101215144431.259|20101215144433.203|TR0|administration that also bombed 
20101215144433.203|20101215144435.147|TR0|Baghdad on multiple occasions in 
20101215144435.147|20101215144437.091|TR0|the north and the south of the 
20101215144437.091|20101215144439.034|TR0|country, as well, under the 
20101215144439.034|20101215144440.978|TR0|guise of the no-fly zones.
20101215144440.978|20101215144442.922|TR0|
20101215144442.922|20101215144444.866|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: This was during 
20101215144444.866|20101215144446.809|TR0|Clinton's years.
20101215144446.809|20101215144448.753|TR0|
20101215144448.753|20101215144450.697|TR0|>> JEREMY SCAHILL: And this was 
20101215144450.697|20101215144452.641|TR0|during the Clinton 
20101215144452.641|20101215144454.584|TR0|administration. So then, when 
20101215144454.584|20101215144456.528|TR0|you fast-forward to the Bush 
20101215144456.528|20101215144458.472|TR0|fraudulent case for war, having 
20101215144458.472|20101215144500.416|TR0|someone like Richard Holbrooke 
20101215144500.416|20101215144502.359|TR0|support it is the embodiment of 
20101215144502.359|20101215144504.303|TR0|the continuity of U.S. foreign 
20101215144504.303|20101215144506.247|TR0|policy in Iraq. Clinton started 
20101215144506.247|20101215144508.191|TR0|the war on Iraq in full after 
20101215144508.191|20101215144510.134|TR0|George H.W. Bush invaded and 
20101215144510.134|20101215144512.078|TR0|attacked Iraq during the 1991 
20101215144512.078|20101215144514.022|TR0|Gulf War, and it's been 
20101215144514.022|20101215144515.965|TR0|consistent U.S. policy. And 
20101215144515.965|20101215144517.909|TR0|Richard Holbrooke has been a 
20101215144517.909|20101215144519.853|TR0|staple of that policy - was a 
20101215144519.853|20101215144521.797|TR0|staple of that policy.
20101215144521.797|20101215144523.740|TR0|
20101215144523.740|20101215144525.684|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go 
20101215144525.684|20101215144527.628|TR0|back in time. I've been to East 
20101215144527.628|20101215144529.572|TR0|Timor a number of times during 
20101215144529.572|20101215144531.515|TR0|the Indonesian occupation, one 
20101215144531.515|20101215144533.459|TR0|of the worst genocides of the 
20101215144533.459|20101215144535.403|TR0|20th century. John Pilger also 
20101215144535.403|20101215144537.347|TR0|did a remarkable documentary 
20101215144537.347|20101215144539.290|TR0|about it called Death of a 
20101215144539.290|20101215144541.234|TR0|Nation. East Timor is a place 
20101215144541.234|20101215144543.178|TR0|that was occupied by the 
20101215144543.178|20101215144545.122|TR0|fourth-largest military in the 
20101215144545.122|20101215144547.065|TR0|world, Indonesia. And it started 
20101215144547.065|20101215144549.009|TR0|under Ford and Kissinger and 
20101215144549.009|20101215144550.953|TR0|went on to Carter, and Holbrooke 
20101215144550.953|20101215144552.897|TR0|was in that administration. A 
20101215144552.897|20101215144554.840|TR0|third of the population was 
20101215144554.840|20101215144556.784|TR0|killed. In 1997, investigative 
20101215144556.784|20101215144558.728|TR0|journalist Allan Nairn went to 
20101215144558.728|20101215144600.671|TR0|Brown University, where Richard 
20101215144600.671|20101215144602.615|TR0|Holbrooke was speaking, and he 
20101215144602.615|20101215144604.559|TR0|questioned him about East Timor.
20101215144604.559|20101215144606.503|TR0|
20101215144606.503|20101215144608.446|TR0|>> ALLAN NAIRN: You were the 
20101215144608.446|20101215144610.390|TR0|Assistant Secretary of State in 
20101215144610.390|20101215144612.334|TR0|the Carter administration at the 
20101215144612.334|20101215144614.278|TR0|height of the genocide in Timor, 
20101215144614.278|20101215144616.221|TR0|the years of '76, '77, '78, '79, 
20101215144616.221|20101215144618.165|TR0|when the killing rose to a peak. 
20101215144618.165|20101215144620.109|TR0|And you were the Carter 
20101215144620.109|20101215144622.053|TR0|administration's point man on 
20101215144622.053|20101215144623.996|TR0|Timor policy. You handled the 
20101215144623.996|20101215144625.940|TR0|testimony before Congress and so 
20101215144625.940|20101215144627.884|TR0|on. And it was under your watch 
20101215144627.884|20101215144629.828|TR0|that the U.S. sent in the OV-10 
20101215144629.828|20101215144631.771|TR0|Bronco planes, the low-flying 
20101215144631.771|20101215144633.715|TR0|planes, which were used to bomb 
20101215144633.715|20101215144635.659|TR0|and strafe the Timorese out of 
20101215144635.659|20101215144637.603|TR0|the hills. Testimony from 
20101215144637.603|20101215144639.546|TR0|Catholic Church sources, reports 
20101215144639.546|20101215144641.490|TR0|from Amnesty International and 
20101215144641.490|20101215144643.434|TR0|others indicated that hundreds 
20101215144643.434|20101215144645.377|TR0|of thousands of East Timorese 
20101215144645.377|20101215144647.321|TR0|were killed during this period. 
20101215144647.321|20101215144649.265|TR0|And during this period, not only 
20101215144649.265|20101215144651.209|TR0|was the U.S. sending in these 
20101215144651.209|20101215144653.152|TR0|weapons which were used to kill 
20101215144653.152|20101215144655.096|TR0|the Timorese, but it was also 
20101215144655.096|20101215144657.040|TR0|blocking the U.N. Security 
20101215144657.040|20101215144658.984|TR0|Council from taking enforcement 
20101215144658.984|20101215144700.927|TR0|action on the two resolutions 
20101215144700.927|20101215144702.871|TR0|which called on Indonesia to 
20101215144702.871|20101215144704.815|TR0|withdraw its troops without 
20101215144704.815|20101215144706.759|TR0|delay. We know this because 
20101215144706.759|20101215144708.702|TR0|Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the 
20101215144708.702|20101215144710.646|TR0|former U.S. ambassador to the 
20101215144710.646|20101215144712.590|TR0|U.N., wrote about it in his 
20101215144712.590|20101215144714.534|TR0|memoirs. That was the policy 
20101215144714.534|20101215144716.477|TR0|that started under Ford and 
20101215144716.477|20101215144718.421|TR0|Kissinger, OK, and you continued 
20101215144718.421|20101215144720.365|TR0|that policy.
20101215144720.365|20101215144722.309|TR0|
20101215144722.309|20101215144724.252|TR0|So, I have two questions. The 
20101215144724.252|20101215144726.196|TR0|first is, would you be willing 
20101215144726.196|20101215144728.140|TR0|to facilitate the full 
20101215144728.140|20101215144730.083|TR0|declassification of documents 
20101215144730.083|20101215144732.027|TR0|regarding what the Carter 
20101215144732.027|20101215144733.971|TR0|administration, your 
20101215144733.971|20101215144735.915|TR0|administration, did in East 
20101215144735.915|20101215144737.858|TR0|Timor by granting a waiver under 
20101215144737.858|20101215144739.802|TR0|the Privacy Act? And secondly, 
20101215144739.802|20101215144741.746|TR0|would you favor the convening, 
20101215144741.746|20101215144743.690|TR0|for the case of East Timor, an 
20101215144743.690|20101215144745.633|TR0|international war crimes 
20101215144745.633|20101215144747.577|TR0|tribunal along the lines of what 
20101215144747.577|20101215144749.521|TR0|has been done in Bosnia and 
20101215144749.521|20101215144751.465|TR0|Rwanda, along the lines of what 
20101215144751.465|20101215144753.408|TR0|President Bush called for in the 
20101215144753.408|20101215144755.352|TR0|case of Saddam Hussein in Iraq? 
20101215144755.352|20101215144757.296|TR0|And would you be willing to 
20101215144757.296|20101215144759.240|TR0|abide by its verdict in regard 
20101215144759.240|20101215144801.183|TR0|to your own conduct?
20101215144801.183|20101215144803.127|TR0|
20101215144803.127|20101215144805.071|TR0|>> RICHARD HOLBROOKE: You know, 
20101215144805.071|20101215144807.015|TR0|first of all, we're not going to 
20101215144807.015|20101215144808.958|TR0|have time to deconstruct your 
20101215144808.958|20101215144810.902|TR0|question and take it on point by 
20101215144810.902|20101215144812.846|TR0|point here. We've got other 
20101215144812.846|20101215144814.789|TR0|questions, and we need to get to 
20101215144814.789|20101215144816.733|TR0|them. But let me say very 
20101215144816.733|20101215144818.677|TR0|clearly, first of all, I don't 
20101215144818.677|20101215144820.621|TR0|accept every statement you have 
20101215144820.621|20101215144822.564|TR0|just made as fact. Far from it. 
20101215144822.564|20101215144824.508|TR0|Moynihan, for example, was not 
20101215144824.508|20101215144826.452|TR0|the ambassador during the Carter 
20101215144826.452|20101215144828.396|TR0|administration; he was the 
20101215144828.396|20101215144830.339|TR0|ambassador during the previous 
20101215144830.339|20101215144832.283|TR0|administration.

20101215144836.171|20101215144838.114|TR0|under Ford, and you continued 
20101215144838.114|20101215144840.058|TR0|that policy.

20101215144843.946|20101215144845.889|TR0|- I don't think we're going to 
20101215144845.889|20101215144847.833|TR0|have time to deconstruct this 
20101215144847.833|20101215144849.777|TR0|here. I do not accept most of 
20101215144849.777|20101215144851.721|TR0|your statements. However, in 
20101215144851.721|20101215144853.664|TR0|regard to the last questions, of 
20101215144853.664|20101215144855.608|TR0|course I favor declassification. 
20101215144855.608|20101215144857.552|TR0|I have no - I have nothing to 
20101215144857.552|20101215144859.495|TR0|hide about my own role. If I 
20101215144859.495|20101215144901.439|TR0|made a mistake or two along the 
20101215144901.439|20101215144903.383|TR0|way, I'll confront it when that 
20101215144903.383|20101215144905.327|TR0|goes  --  when that comes up. No 
20101215144905.327|20101215144907.270|TR0|one is error-free here. But just 
20101215144907.270|20101215144909.214|TR0|for the purpose of everyone else 
20101215144909.214|20101215144911.158|TR0|in the room, this is not an 
20101215144911.158|20101215144913.102|TR0|accurate description of the 
20101215144913.102|20101215144915.045|TR0|administration's policy or my 
20101215144915.045|20101215144916.989|TR0|own role in it. As I said in my 
20101215144916.989|20101215144918.933|TR0|opening remarks, Indonesia was 
20101215144918.933|20101215144920.877|TR0|an important country and remains 
20101215144920.877|20101215144922.820|TR0|an important country. And the 
20101215144922.820|20101215144924.764|TR0|solution to the problem, as I 
20101215144924.764|20101215144926.708|TR0|said to an earlier question, 
20101215144926.708|20101215144928.652|TR0|does not, in my view, involve a 
20101215144928.652|20101215144930.595|TR0|complete arms cut off. You're 
20101215144930.595|20101215144932.539|TR0|welcome to disagree. But I am 
20101215144932.539|20101215144934.483|TR0|interested in consequences of 
20101215144934.483|20101215144936.427|TR0|policy. I'm interested in

20101215144942.258|20101215144944.201|TR0|in this case were genocide: a

20101215144953.920|20101215144955.864|TR0|you're welcome to do so. And if 
20101215144955.864|20101215144957.808|TR0|- as far as extending the war 
20101215144957.808|20101215144959.751|TR0|crimes tribunal to Timor, or for 
20101215144959.751|20101215145001.695|TR0|that matter, Cambodia, where 
20101215145001.695|20101215145003.639|TR0|it's incomprehensibly not of a

20101215145005.583|20101215145007.526|TR0|fact, I have recently written a

20101215145015.301|20101215145017.245|TR0|incomprehensible to me why

20101215145025.020|20101215145026.964|TR0|here, for the benefit of 
20101215145026.964|20101215145028.907|TR0|everyone else, that the Timor

20101215145030.851|20101215145032.795|TR0|described just now. It just 
20101215145032.795|20101215145034.739|TR0|isn't. This is not what

20101215145136.938|20101215145138.882|TR0|air raid carried out by the 
20101215145138.882|20101215145140.826|TR0|Indonesian air force using a 
20101215145140.826|20101215145142.770|TR0|Bronco aircraft. Two 
20101215145142.770|20101215145144.713|TR0|American-supplied Bronco 
20101215145144.713|20101215145146.657|TR0|aircraft nose-dived to a village 
20101215145146.657|20101215145148.601|TR0|somewhere in the remote 
20101215145148.601|20101215145150.545|TR0|countryside and opened fire on 
20101215145150.545|20101215145152.488|TR0|the village. At that particular 
20101215145152.488|20101215145154.432|TR0|moment, there were no guerrilla 
20101215145154.432|20101215145156.376|TR0|troops there, only civilian 
20101215145156.376|20101215145158.319|TR0|population. My sister was there. 
20101215145158.319|20101215145200.263|TR0|She was running the local 
20101215145200.263|20101215145202.207|TR0|school. She and 20 kids, at 
20101215145202.207|20101215145204.151|TR0|least, were killed.
20101215145204.151|20101215145206.094|TR0|
20101215145206.094|20101215145208.038|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was Jose 
20101215145208.038|20101215145209.982|TR0|Ramos-Horta, who became a close 
20101215145209.982|20101215145211.926|TR0|friend, by the way, of Richard 
20101215145211.926|20101215145213.869|TR0|Holbrooke. John Pilger, your 
20101215145213.869|20101215145215.813|TR0|response?
20101215145215.813|20101215145217.757|TR0|
20101215145217.757|20101215145219.701|TR0|>> JOHN PILGER: Well, look, 
20101215145219.701|20101215145221.644|TR0|Richard Holbrooke is the 
20101215145221.644|20101215145223.588|TR0|embodiment of rapacious U.S. 
20101215145223.588|20101215145225.532|TR0|policy. And I think there's 
20101215145225.532|20101215145227.476|TR0|something interesting here in 
20101215145227.476|20101215145229.419|TR0|the - all the commemoration of 
20101215145229.419|20101215145231.363|TR0|his career that has gone on, 
20101215145231.363|20101215145233.307|TR0|interesting in regard to the 
20101215145233.307|20101215145235.251|TR0|WikiLeaks issue, because here we 
20101215145235.251|20101215145237.194|TR0|have - and it's not only in the 
20101215145237.194|20101215145239.138|TR0|United States, it's here, as 
20101215145239.138|20101215145241.082|TR0|well: "This great peacemaker, 
20101215145241.082|20101215145243.025|TR0|this great statesman, has passed 
20101215145243.025|20101215145244.969|TR0|on." Well, that's just not true. 
20101215145244.969|20101215145246.913|TR0|And if we'd had a kind of 
20101215145246.913|20101215145248.857|TR0|WikiLeaks glimpse of the truth 
20101215145248.857|20101215145250.800|TR0|of Holbrooke's career, we might 
20101215145250.800|20101215145252.744|TR0|not be getting all these 
20101215145252.744|20101215145254.688|TR0|effusions at the moment.
20101215145254.688|20101215145256.632|TR0|
20101215145256.632|20101215145258.575|TR0|Just going back a little bit 
20101215145258.575|20101215145300.519|TR0|earlier in my experience, Amy, 
20101215145300.519|20101215145302.463|TR0|then I would bring it up to East 
20101215145302.463|20101215145304.407|TR0|Timor, but my first knowledge of 
20101215145304.407|20101215145306.350|TR0|Richard Holbrooke's involvement 
20101215145306.350|20101215145308.294|TR0|was when the foreign minister of 
20101215145308.294|20101215145310.238|TR0|Vietnam, Nguyen Co Thach, in 
20101215145310.238|20101215145312.182|TR0|1978 told me in confidence - 
20101215145312.182|20101215145314.125|TR0|Thach is now dead, so I'm sure I 
20101215145314.125|20101215145316.069|TR0|can speak about this - he told 
20101215145316.069|20101215145318.013|TR0|me that Holbrooke, in 1978, had 
20101215145318.013|20101215145319.957|TR0|given him assurances that the 
20101215145319.957|20101215145321.900|TR0|administration, of which he was 
20101215145321.900|20101215145323.844|TR0|a leading member, of course, at 
20101215145323.844|20101215145325.788|TR0|the time, the Carter 
20101215145325.788|20101215145327.731|TR0|administration, would, if not 
20101215145327.731|20101215145329.675|TR0|normalize with Vietnam, then it 
20101215145329.675|20101215145331.619|TR0|would lift the siege. And it was 
20101215145331.619|20101215145333.563|TR0|an economic siege, an embargo. A 
20101215145333.563|20101215145335.506|TR0|Trading with the Enemy Act was 
20101215145335.506|20101215145337.450|TR0|the being imposed on the 
20101215145337.450|20101215145339.394|TR0|Vietnamese. There was terrible 
20101215145339.394|20101215145341.338|TR0|hardship and starvation in 
20101215145341.338|20101215145343.281|TR0|Vietnam, all of it a policy of 
20101215145343.281|20101215145345.225|TR0|revenge for expelling the 
20101215145345.225|20101215145347.169|TR0|Americans, three years later. 
20101215145347.169|20101215145349.113|TR0|Holbrooke had said to Thach, who 
20101215145349.113|20101215145351.056|TR0|was - they met together in New 
20101215145351.056|20101215145353.000|TR0|York in 1978, and Holbrooke had 
20101215145353.000|20101215145354.944|TR0|told him to wait for a call. And 
20101215145354.944|20101215145356.888|TR0|Thach said, "I waited in the 
20101215145356.888|20101215145358.831|TR0|Holiday Inn on, I think, West 
20101215145358.831|20101215145400.775|TR0|42nd Street for four days, 
20101215145400.775|20101215145402.719|TR0|waiting for a call from 
20101215145402.719|20101215145404.663|TR0|Holbrooke, which he had promised 
20101215145404.663|20101215145406.606|TR0|to let me have and to describe 
20101215145406.606|20101215145408.550|TR0|the new policy towards Vietnam. 
20101215145408.550|20101215145410.494|TR0|And it never came. He refused to 
20101215145410.494|20101215145412.437|TR0|answer my messages." And the 
20101215145412.437|20101215145414.381|TR0|imposition of extreme austerity 
20101215145414.381|20101215145416.325|TR0|as a policy of revenge 
20101215145416.325|20101215145418.269|TR0|continued. That always seemed to 
20101215145418.269|20101215145420.212|TR0|me to sum up the kind of 
20101215145420.212|20101215145422.156|TR0|duplicitous nature of 
20101215145422.156|20101215145424.100|TR0|Holbrooke's role.
20101215145424.100|20101215145426.044|TR0|
20101215145426.044|20101215145427.987|TR0|Certainly, as you rightly 
20101215145427.987|20101215145429.931|TR0|described - and it's very 
20101215145429.931|20101215145431.875|TR0|interesting listening to Allan 
20101215145431.875|20101215145433.819|TR0|Nairn's excellent questioning of 
20101215145433.819|20101215145435.762|TR0|Holbrooke there. I mean, I was 
20101215145435.762|20101215145437.706|TR0|told by the senior CIA official 
20101215145437.706|20101215145439.650|TR0|in the embassy in Jakarta at the 
20101215145439.650|20101215145441.594|TR0|time - Philip Liechty appears in 
20101215145441.594|20101215145443.537|TR0|my film - of the kind of support 
20101215145443.537|20101215145445.481|TR0|that the regime in Jakarta was 
20101215145445.481|20101215145447.425|TR0|getting of aircraft, logistics, 
20101215145447.425|20101215145449.368|TR0|Broncos, logistics, armaments, 
20101215145449.368|20101215145451.312|TR0|all kinds of support, that were 
20101215145451.312|20101215145453.256|TR0|going directly - directly into 
20101215145453.256|20101215145455.200|TR0|East Timor, in spite of public 
20101215145455.200|20101215145457.143|TR0|declarations by the likes of 
20101215145457.143|20101215145459.087|TR0|Holbrooke that this was not 
20101215145459.087|20101215145501.031|TR0|happening.

20101215145508.806|20101215145510.750|TR0|>> JOHN PILGER: So, as Liechty 
20101215145510.750|20101215145512.693|TR0|made clear -
20101215145512.693|20101215145514.637|TR0|
20101215145514.637|20101215145516.581|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: John, because we 
20101215145516.581|20101215145518.525|TR0|just have two minutes and we 
20101215145518.525|20101215145520.468|TR0|have so many areas to cover, I 
20101215145520.468|20101215145522.412|TR0|wanted to fast-forward to 
20101215145522.412|20101215145524.356|TR0|Yugoslavia -

20101215145532.131|20101215145534.074|TR0|you lived and covered for years. 
20101215145534.074|20101215145536.018|TR0|Talk about your experience.
20101215145536.018|20101215145537.962|TR0|
20101215145537.962|20101215145539.906|TR0|>> JEREMY SCAHILL: Well, you 
20101215145539.906|20101215145541.849|TR0|know, Richard Holbrooke was a 
20101215145541.849|20101215145543.793|TR0|central player in the 
20101215145543.793|20101215145545.737|TR0|disintegration of Yugoslavia in 
20101215145545.737|20101215145547.681|TR0|the 1990s. Everyone knows. The 
20101215145547.681|20101215145549.624|TR0|whole world knows. Slobodan 
20101215145549.624|20101215145551.568|TR0|Milosevic was a mass murderer 
20101215145551.568|20101215145553.512|TR0|and a thug. Radovan Karadzic, 
20101215145553.512|20101215145555.456|TR0|Ratko Mladic, all of these 
20101215145555.456|20101215145557.399|TR0|Bosnian Serb leaders, they were 
20101215145557.399|20101215145559.343|TR0|thugs. What never gets talked 
20101215145559.343|20101215145601.287|TR0|about is that what Richard 
20101215145601.287|20101215145603.231|TR0|Holbrooke and other U.S. 
20101215145603.231|20101215145605.174|TR0|officials were doing was 
20101215145605.174|20101215145607.118|TR0|supporting Croatian ethnic 
20101215145607.118|20101215145609.062|TR0|cleansers that were trained by 
20101215145609.062|20101215145611.006|TR0|U.S. private military company 
20101215145611.006|20101215145612.949|TR0|MPRI to engage in the 
20101215145612.949|20101215145614.893|TR0|single-greatest ethnic cleansing 
20101215145614.893|20101215145616.837|TR0|of the war against the Serbs in

20101215145620.724|20101215145622.668|TR0|Then you fast-forward to later 
20101215145622.668|20101215145624.612|TR0|in the Clinton administration, 
20101215145624.612|20101215145626.555|TR0|Richard Holbrooke was a key 
20101215145626.555|20101215145628.499|TR0|player in essentially providing 
20101215145628.499|20101215145630.443|TR0|a false pretext for war over 
20101215145630.443|20101215145632.387|TR0|Kosovo against Slobodan 
20101215145632.387|20101215145634.330|TR0|Milosevic, known as the 
20101215145634.330|20101215145636.274|TR0|Rambouillet Accord. The U.S. 
20101215145636.274|20101215145638.218|TR0|essentially said to Slobodan 
20101215145638.218|20101215145640.162|TR0|Milosevic, "If you don't sign an 
20101215145640.162|20101215145642.105|TR0|agreement that would allow us to 
20101215145642.105|20101215145644.049|TR0|occupy your country, allow you 
20101215145644.049|20101215145645.993|TR0|to take control of your media 
20101215145645.993|20101215145647.937|TR0|outlets, allow our forces to be 
20101215145647.937|20101215145649.880|TR0|immunized from prosecution in 
20101215145649.880|20101215145651.824|TR0|your country, we are going to 
20101215145651.824|20101215145653.768|TR0|bomb you." Richard Holbrooke 
20101215145653.768|20101215145655.712|TR0|delivered that ultimatum to 
20101215145655.712|20101215145657.655|TR0|Slobodan Milosevic following the 
20101215145657.655|20101215145659.599|TR0|Rambouillet discussion. 
20101215145659.599|20101215145701.543|TR0|Milosevic, like any leader in 
20101215145701.543|20101215145703.486|TR0|the world, rejected an 
20101215145703.486|20101215145705.430|TR0|occupation agreement, and so the 
20101215145705.430|20101215145707.374|TR0|United States bombed. Holbrooke, 
20101215145707.374|20101215145709.318|TR0|when you and I questioned him 
20101215145709.318|20101215145711.261|TR0|later at the Overseas Press Club 
20101215145711.261|20101215145713.205|TR0|in April of 1999, denied that he 
20101215145713.205|20101215145715.149|TR0|had ever said that that was 
20101215145715.149|20101215145717.093|TR0|[not] an occupation agreement, 
20101215145717.093|20101215145719.036|TR0|when in fact he had said it on 
20101215145719.036|20101215145720.980|TR0|Charlie Rose's show.
20101215145720.980|20101215145722.924|TR0|
20101215145722.924|20101215145724.868|TR0|At that same event where you and 
20101215145724.868|20101215145726.811|TR0|I confronted Richard Holbrooke, 
20101215145726.811|20101215145728.755|TR0|the Overseas Press Club Award, 
20101215145728.755|20101215145730.699|TR0|he celebrated the bombing of 
20101215145730.699|20101215145732.643|TR0|Radio Television Serbia, after 
20101215145732.643|20101215145734.586|TR0|Eason Jordan, the president of 
20101215145734.586|20101215145736.530|TR0|CNN International, told him it 
20101215145736.530|20101215145738.474|TR0|had been bombed. And he said 
20101215145738.474|20101215145740.418|TR0|that it was a positive 
20101215145740.418|20101215145742.361|TR0|development. On a night when 
20101215145742.361|20101215145744.305|TR0|they were honoring foreign 
20101215145744.305|20101215145746.249|TR0|correspondents, Richard 
20101215145746.249|20101215145748.192|TR0|Holbrooke was praising the 
20101215145748.192|20101215145750.136|TR0|outright murder of media workers 
20101215145750.136|20101215145752.080|TR0|- 16 media workers, including 
20101215145752.080|20101215145754.024|TR0|make-up artists and engineers - 
20101215145754.024|20101215145755.967|TR0|none of Milosevic's 
20101215145755.967|20101215145757.911|TR0|propagandists killed. RTS was 
20101215145757.911|20101215145759.855|TR0|not taken off the air. It was a 
20101215145759.855|20101215145801.799|TR0|war crime according to Amnesty 
20101215145801.799|20101215145803.742|TR0|International, and praised by 
20101215145803.742|20101215145805.686|TR0|Richard Holbrooke. To me, that's 
20101215145805.686|20101215145807.630|TR0|the embodiment of what his 
20101215145807.630|20101215145809.574|TR0|career has meant in terms of its 
20101215145809.574|20101215145811.517|TR0|projection of U.S. power around 
20101215145811.517|20101215145813.461|TR0|the world. There are good 
20101215145813.461|20101215145815.405|TR0|victims and bad victims; the 
20101215145815.405|20101215145817.349|TR0|media workers of Radio 
20101215145817.349|20101215145819.292|TR0|Television Serbia, they deserved 
20101215145819.292|20101215145821.236|TR0|to die that day, but the 
20101215145821.236|20101215145823.180|TR0|journalists of the United States 
20101215145823.180|20101215145825.124|TR0|or China or North Korea who get 
20101215145825.124|20101215145827.067|TR0|imprisoned in foreign countries, 
20101215145827.067|20101215145829.011|TR0|those are worthy victims. The 
20101215145829.011|20101215145830.955|TR0|same can be said about the way 
20101215145830.955|20101215145832.898|TR0|the U.S. prosecuted its war in 
20101215145832.898|20101215145834.842|TR0|Yugoslavia and in Iraq, Turkey 
20101215145834.842|20101215145836.786|TR0|with the Kurds, Richard 
20101215145836.786|20101215145838.730|TR0|Holbrooke at the center of it 
20101215145838.730|20101215145840.673|TR0|for his whole career.
20101215145840.673|20101215145842.617|TR0|
20101215145842.617|20101215145844.561|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, a very 
20101215145844.561|20101215145846.505|TR0|critical analysis, Jeremy 
20101215145846.505|20101215145848.448|TR0|Scahill, John Pilger. I want to
