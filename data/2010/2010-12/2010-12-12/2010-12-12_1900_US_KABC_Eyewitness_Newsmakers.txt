20101212190519.000|20101212190521.000|CCO|GET PASSED THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
20101212190521.000|20101212190522.667|CCO|WEEKS BUT I THINK THE MAJORITY 
20101212190522.667|20101212190524.333|CCO|OF WORK WILL BE IN JANUARY WHEN 
20101212190524.333|20101212190526.000|CCO|WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR.
20101212190526.000|20101212190527.667|CCO|>> WILL TAX INCREASES BE THE 
20101212190527.667|20101212190529.333|CCO|WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM?
20101212190529.333|20101212190531.000|CCO|>> I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE ON 
20101212190531.000|20101212190532.250|CCO|THE TABLE.
20101212190532.250|20101212190533.500|CCO|YOU CAN'T SAY THAT EVERYTHING 
20101212190533.500|20101212190534.750|CCO|IS OFF THE TABLE.
20101212190534.750|20101212190536.000|CCO|WE HAVE TO HAVE AN HONEST 
20101212190536.000|20101212190537.250|CCO|CONVERSATION ABOUT TAXES.
20101212190537.250|20101212190538.500|CCO|I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE 
20101212190538.500|20101212190539.750|CCO|PASSING ANY BROAD BASE THE TAX 
20101212190539.750|20101212190541.000|CCO|INCREASES BUT I THINK WE HAVE 
20101212190541.000|20101212190543.000|CCO|TO LOOK AT SOME TAXES.
20101212190543.000|20101212190545.000|CCO|THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT 
20101212190545.000|20101212190547.000|CCO|DECREASING SALES TAX AND 
20101212190547.000|20101212190549.000|CCO|INCREASING INCOME TAX NOMINALLY 
20101212190549.000|20101212190551.000|CCO|AND THE REASON TO DO THAT IS WE 
20101212190551.000|20101212190552.111|CCO|WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
20101212190552.111|20101212190553.222|CCO|FEDERAL DEDUCTABILITY OF INCOME 
20101212190553.222|20101212190554.333|CCO|TAX.
20101212190554.333|20101212190555.444|CCO|THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT IN 
20101212190555.444|20101212190556.556|CCO|SUCH A WAY THAT YOU BRING IN 
20101212190556.556|20101212190557.667|CCO|EXTRA MONEY TO THE STATE 
20101212190557.667|20101212190558.778|CCO|GOVERNMENT BUT YOU DECREASE THE

20101212190559.889|20101212190601.000|CCO|TAXPAYER.
20101212190601.000|20101212190602.429|CCO|THAT'S SOMETHING WORTHY OF 
20101212190602.429|20101212190603.857|CCO|CONSIDERATION.
20101212190603.857|20101212190605.286|CCO|THERE ARE OTHER AREAS OF TAX 
20101212190605.286|20101212190606.714|CCO|REASSIGNMENT THAT ARE ALSO 
20101212190606.714|20101212190608.143|CCO|WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION.
20101212190608.143|20101212190609.571|CCO|I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT 
20101212190609.571|20101212190611.000|CCO|HUGE BROAD BASED TAX INCREASES.
20101212190611.000|20101212190612.250|CCO|THERE IS VALUE IN TALKING ABOUT 
20101212190612.250|20101212190613.500|CCO|WHETHER WE EXTEND SOME 
20101212190613.500|20101212190614.750|CCO|TEMPORARY TAXS THAT HAVE BEEN 
20101212190614.750|20101212190616.000|CCO|PUT IN PLACE AND THAT PEOPLE

20101212190617.250|20101212190618.500|CCO|>> WOULD EITHER THE EXTENSION 
20101212190618.500|20101212190619.750|CCO|OR ANY INCREASES CONSTITUTIONAL 
20101212190619.750|20101212190621.000|CCO|REQUIRE THE VOTE OF THE 
20101212190621.000|20101212190622.250|CCO|ELECTORATE?
20101212190622.250|20101212190623.500|CCO|>> BOTH WOULD REQUIRE A 2/3 
20101212190623.500|20101212190624.750|CCO|VOTE AND QUITE FRANKLY, 
20101212190624.750|20101212190626.000|CCO|GOVERNOR-ELECT BROWN HAS SAID 
20101212190626.000|20101212190627.250|CCO|HE WON'T SIGN ANY TAX INCREASES 
20101212190627.250|20101212190628.500|CCO|AND I THINK HE ALSO MEANS 
20101212190628.500|20101212190629.750|CCO|EXTENSIONS, WITHOUT A DIRECT 
20101212190629.750|20101212190631.000|CCO|VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.
20101212190631.000|20101212190633.000|CCO|SO ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD DO 
20101212190633.000|20101212190635.000|CCO|WOULD REQUIRE A 2/3 VOTE AND 
20101212190635.000|20101212190637.000|CCO|LIKELY REQUIRE A VOTE OF THE 
20101212190637.000|20101212190639.000|CCO|PEOPLE TO RATIFY.
20101212190639.000|20101212190641.000|CCO|>> SO THE CONVERSATION IS, AND 
20101212190641.000|20101212190644.333|CCO|I'M SURE YOU READ AS WELL BUT 
20101212190644.333|20101212190647.667|CCO|THE STRATEGY MAY BE THAT THE 
20101212190647.667|20101212190651.000|CCO|LEGISLATURE COMES BACK AND THAT 
20101212190651.000|20101212190652.429|CCO|PASSES BY MARCH A VERY AUSTERE

20101212190703.500|20101212190706.000|CCO|HAVE TO ACT IN THE SPIRIT.

20101212190708.500|20101212190711.000|CCO|THINGS THAT TRADITIONALLY WE'VE 
20101212190711.000|20101212190712.667|CCO|HAD MONEY TO DO.
20101212190712.667|20101212190714.333|CCO|WE HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS 
20101212190714.333|20101212190716.000|CCO|AND IF THERE ARE ANY REVENUE

20101212190719.333|20101212190721.000|CCO|>> FINALLY IN THE LAST ELECTION 
20101212190721.000|20101212190723.000|CCO|WE SAW THAT ONCE AGAIN, 
20101212190723.000|20101212190725.000|CCO|CALIFORNIA VOTERS WANT THEIR

20101212190736.000|20101212190738.500|CCO|>> IT IS BUT THEN THE VOTERS 
20101212190738.500|20101212190741.000|CCO|NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE 
20101212190741.000|20101212190743.000|CCO|IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR DECISIONS.
20101212190743.000|20101212190745.000|CCO|IF THE VOTERS SAY NO TO ANY

20101212190752.250|20101212190753.500|CCO|I THINK THAT'S THE WRONG WAY TO 
20101212190753.500|20101212190754.750|CCO|GO.
20101212190754.750|20101212190756.000|CCO|THERE ARE ALSO LEGAL QUESTIONS

20101212190757.250|20101212190758.500|CCO|TAXES BEFORE THE PEOPLE BECAUSE 
20101212190758.500|20101212190759.750|CCO|OF THE WAY THAT OUR

20101212190819.750|20101212190821.000|CCO|THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF THE 
20101212190821.000|20101212190822.250|CCO|CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS THAT THE 
20101212190822.250|20101212190823.500|CCO|LEGISLATURE CAN'T PUNT TO THE

20101212190827.250|20101212190828.500|CCO|IT WOULD HAVE TO PASS BY 2/3
