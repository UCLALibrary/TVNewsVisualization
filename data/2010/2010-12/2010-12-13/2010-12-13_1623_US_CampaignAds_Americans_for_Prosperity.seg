aids are prone products ob gyn recalled in of across the globe actually because of foreign materials found in them including metal and would particles so for those in washington many democrats are otherwise it would be told having caucusing in cursing at each other and working up a tantrum all out sab yoga thanks dope anyway mister khud nor the vast how nelson the man who's questions at the state from the old care plans calls the medicaid provisions in what became known as the prosser kickback welly back again not to prevent a build over all the old individual mandate thing so pretty amazing thing about our two guests fred stevens of the conservative group americans for prosperity right now this country says is we're friends and on remake it or what i think that this is i think they're nelson and thank you for having me no i believe ben nelson is running for re-election in two thousand twelve then allison is doing this because the health care bill the cornhuskers kickback these are so controversial and oppose in nebraska usa ben nelson going from having one of the highest approval ratings in united states senate above seventy seventy two percent he's now below fifty ben nelson is doing this because the simply it's for political reasons is doing this because the brass concert chain of the coin esther kickback ishameed of this new entitlement spending that we cannot afford in their shame that ben nelson and a decisive role in making this happen which is a lot of people who we're not caught up in the drama when it wasn't selling as a discordant circuit park wasn't attempt on his part two exams are nebraska from some of the owners medicaid provision our special allowance that other states are not afforded other states where i'm working very she's at the same thing but it let's assume he did that uh... you know meetings but i guess on issues he has also been a record for extending that the bush tax cuts for everybody so he's generally tried to be a more moderate voice only some of democrats in the senate where's he going to go on in this might be a part of the book attempts at moderate his positions or is it too late you know i was going to say milieu where you've been talking about your marks in in your show today and previously the connecticut back for us the easiest way to describe it is one giant your mark because that's exactly what it was it was a sweetheart deal done behind closed doors two-tenths hi senator nelson the vote for the health care bill that nebraskans in the country did not want to the classic kickback isn't your mark and frankly i think uh... senator alston miscalculated politically why he thought he was going to be rewarded for bringing home the bacon back to the state of nebraska and instead by he he he he saw a lot of controversy we saw a lot of nebraska feels very badly in ipl would be dead i'm sorry but it's pretty because not only is he revisiting with one of the lease popular measures the so-called meza forced people to buy health care towards the became the stuff of lawsuits across the country but now you're seeing the president rivers of the so-called ten ninety nine provision where i was businesses after file a form for for benefits that are doled out to workers so it is that some of the big things that were warned about are now being sort of real legislative absolutely in and i i think you have perhaps that you know after the then the tidal wave that we've seen in the november elections that you see moderates democrats who what's in it and also needs entire career as governor of the statement of resting now united state senator you know he's positioned himself really silly rhetorically as as a moderator of for centuries and i and i believe absolutely right now he's trying to reposition himself that way and all make a confession here on national t_v_ in two thousand six i'd vote in for ben nelson needing a conservative free-market registered republican pie and i'm not the only one obviously these are elected united state senator so i'm in the majority but we bought into the rhetoric we bought into this idea that you had a conservative democrat ben nelson but you know if looking at how he was the decisive vote for one of them spending bills in our nation's history that is absolutely unfunded and it produces unfunded mandates into the state you know one of the big issues that we have to drive home is that this your mark this corner skirt kickback that entices then nelson's vote for this it's gonna cost not just america trillions of dollars that's going to cost states states like nebraska itu arf state budgets money we do not have a lot a lot of my sister gave your forecasts were edited jersey and tired of a bread stephens thank you for months thank you know will relax as the president while role has got your back koro no one alignments has been going nuts
