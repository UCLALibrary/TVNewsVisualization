HED|You might be confusing me with someone who thinks we should use the tax code as a tool of economic redistribution, social engineering. I don't see it that way. We should have a tax code that maximizes competitiveness, job creation, economic growth and raises the proper amount of revenue for the government.<br /><br /><a href="http://paulryan.house.gov/" target="_blank" title="http://paulryan.house.gov/">http://paulryan.house.gov/</a><br /><a href="http://www.house.gov/budget_republicans/" target="_blank" title="http://www.house.gov/budget_republicans/">http://www.house.gov/budget_republicans/</a> <br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/reppaulryan" target="_blank" title="http://www.facebook.com/reppaulryan">http://www.facebook.com/reppaulryan</a> <br /><a href="http://www.twitter.com/reppaulryan" target="_blank" title="http://www.twitter.com/reppaulryan">http://www.twitter.com/reppaulryan</a>

20101213211501.339|20101213212250.849|TR1|we began the show was filled with the chairman of the house budget committee congressman paul ryan wisconsin he joins us now from his office in janesville are welcome congressman uh... let me start auditor meow by asking you are supporting the tax cut deal it as it does add about two aaron for debating the deficit next two years will it be enacted the apparent and will it be changed at all i don't think it will be changed i think more often than not yes it will be enacted we'll see what they're supposed to dust look they're throwing a fit uh... a lot of that number that you sited is just simply results from keeping taxes where the are right we are opposed to raising taxes though there's a lot of this deal i don't like it out there's lots of i don't like but at what i don't like the most is a huge tax increase in generate has been a put a lot of volatility in the economy to damage the economy job creation so i_d_'s for this deal lies the best for me to get i think my deal is a deal we have an agreement bomb and that ought to be honored and it should pass soon so we don't create this volatility in the economy what they are really freighter fussed over as you say is the biz the provision that lower the estate tax uh... and what they're fourteen billion dollars over two years affects very very few wealthy airs the democrats claim that while working-class americans are struggling why give is trying to break to the very wealthy what they carry conservative congress erlin as dell circles affirmative action for the rich well first of all this is my if you've already paid taxes on wielding a knife and i thought that would raise taxes on this so cell twelve arsenal it with these heroes take that you have a step up and basis carryover than you do pay capital gains when you saw the acid as an air so that you do have sienna paying capital gains but that point aside for a moment this is the biggest killer of intergenerational transfer of businesses we're not talking about you know bill gates here we're talking about successful family businesses and farms that are big employers heading to be cut in half or liquidated in order to pay a tax when the owner died this is not right let's turn to the deficit bloomberg national poll this week shows americans by big numbers they oppose cutting domestic spending they oppose cutting defense there against any entitlement reductions they want to keep tax breaks like the mortgage deduction and farm subsidies can send a gasoline tax wallace in the favors higher taxes on the regiments test and social security given a lack of public service not enough yeah i know do you think you really can get anything significantly done in the next congress i hope so i really sincerely do hope we can get something significant in this country we had divided government health care is the biggest source of our budget fiscal problems and my guess is we're not gonna get agreement on the president that you know a story about that but hopefully on these other issues social security perhaps discretionary spending budget control spending caps things like that we can get something done we've got to get a dent in this problem we cannot accept that for just two years when i could do anything to improve our fiscal situation so we got to put a dent on this problem and that's why i'm hoping in a gets something with the president under this divided government scenario in the right direction or early n that next session as you know congress he's going to be facing the prospect of raising the debt ceiling how much in a way of spending cuts do you think you have to be chief or do they have to be achieved before you can address that issue will quite a bit to beat a candid with you we intends to do a lot to spending cuts not sustaining spending reforms is weak takeover in january leading up until that moment which will be anywhere from our step too many and so hopefully by then we all got a lot of of good things to cut spending to put controls on spending and then hopefully accompanying a debt ceiling increase will get some kind of real fiscal controls they can get this thing from around the debt ceiling obviously is going to have to be increased if we're not going to default so the question is what we didn't exchange for that and what kind of fiscal controls look we don't think we have a revenue problem eating keeping taxes where they are ready to go back to the historic levels what we have is a massive spending problem as a source of our problems if we chase higher spending with higher revenues we're going to shut down the economy and hurt job creation they give us an idea of the scope of that germany cut you're talking about size and scope well so wheat the budget itself doesn't occur till spring so before the budget you can do is current fiscal year spending sweet intent on doing summer session bills and we wanted responding back to something like three binge pre bump spending levels of two thousand eight so that means we want to go after it on a good hundred billion dollar down payment on discretionary spending for the spring occurs because the budget doesn't occur until april so that's why we have to go out for discretionary spending now in current levels of the scriptures betting how about tax reform that could be on the rebound again in their sheer is it a good idea and put it raise revenues it is good idea it catch affords a good idea that the question what kind of tax reform it i was on the whole simpson commission and they did some great things and tax reform our dumb things a few a few things differently but they acknowledge that high tax rates kills growth in jobs we need to lower tax rates so the idea of a broader tax base and lower tax rates which is good for economic competitiveness international benefits and job creation is something that that people from the center left in the right or acknowledging together so i would like to think that there's a becoming a centrist solution here more internationally competitive corporate tax rates more air nationally competitive small-business tax rates lower tax rates an all-american the broader tax base seeded ready you need to fund the government where we might have disagreement is what is the proper level of revenues because again we just have a different view on the size of government we think it ought to be limited we have it ought to be back with historic levels and as we want to do capacity you have said that barack obama practices class warfare will all lead yet your roadmap some critics say involves a massive transfer of wealth a would argue to the rich eliminates taxes on capital gains dividends as states lorraine raids and offsetting some of this with the new consumption tax no tax policy center says that which is one tenth of one percent would get average tax cut of one point seven million eight-year is in this class warfare for the rich and there are no i don't see it that way look you might be confusing you with someone who thinks we should use the tax code as a tool of economic redistribution a rough social engineering i don't see it that way we should have a tax code that maximizes competitiveness job creation economic growth and raise the proper amount of revenue for the government and i do maintain a progressive tax code for individuals what is don't do is much of what we have right now because i think it's hurting growth and we have a very internationally non-competitive ac system what i also do though fail that you're not get any credit for it is a means test our entitlement programs i say the people who are wealthy you're not going to get as much of a subsidy offer for medicare or personal security as everybody else in america gets using rigid agar dying people as much as we do everybody and i would point out that's one of the few things that get support from the from the public in our poll me ask you find a question one of your bosses and your manners and i think when your political heroes was delayed jack kemp and you certainly picked up his mantle enchanting tax cuts and economic growth campbell also stood against his party establishment sometimes and publicly identifying with specific efforts to help african-americans latinos are you going to take up those causes tilen here you know i do believe in that of course love jack nobody match jack's passion and zeal for bringing the ideas of economic growth liberty and freedom pro-growth economics to people who have not seen it before i do believe that we need to have a pro-growth opportunity message that goes to those people who've never seen it before we need to lower the wrongs of the economic ladder so people who've never seen it before can climb up and make the most of our lives so i really do believe that this is a message that we've got to take and yes i a i'm just happy to be mention the same sentences jack on this moment on this issue welcome chairman today ryan graduation wisconsin thank you very much
