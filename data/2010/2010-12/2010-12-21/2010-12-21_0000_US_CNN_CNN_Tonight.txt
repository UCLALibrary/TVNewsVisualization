20101221000011.000|20101221000013.000|TR0|Good evening everyone.
20101221000013.000|20101221000015.000|TR0|
20101221000015.000|20101221000018.000|TR0|Are Senate Republicans jeopardizing 
20101221000018.000|20101221000020.000|TR0|national security just to flex their 
20101221000020.000|20101221000022.000|TR0|political muscle or because they are still 
20101221000022.000|20101221000024.000|TR0|mad Congress voted to repeal the ban on 
20101221000024.000|20101221000026.000|TR0|gays serving openly in the military? 
20101221000026.000|20101221000029.000|TR0|That's what Obama White House and its 
20101221000029.000|20101221000031.000|TR0|allies believe tonight as the Senate 
20101221000031.000|20101221000033.000|TR0|stages a Christmas week showdown over a 
20101221000033.000|20101221000035.000|TR0|nuclear arms treaty. The Republicans say 
20101221000035.000|20101221000038.000|TR0|the president negotiated a deal which 
20101221000038.000|20101221000040.000|TR0|gives Russia giant advantages.

20101221000046.000|20101221000049.000|TR0|SEN. RICHARD SHELBY, (R) ALABAMA:  I will 
20101221000049.000|20101221000051.000|TR0|not support subordinating U.S. national 
20101221000051.000|20101221000053.000|TR0|security to an untrustworthy partner and 
20101221000053.000|20101221000055.000|TR0|neither should the United States Senate.

20101221000102.000|20101221000104.000|TR0|KING:  Also in Senate limbo, legislation 
20101221000104.000|20101221000106.000|TR0|to provide care to 9/11 first responders 
20101221000106.000|20101221000109.000|TR0|who were exposed toxins, but have 
20101221000109.000|20101221000111.000|TR0|exhausted their normal health benefits.  
20101221000111.000|20101221000113.000|TR0|New York Democratic senators say they can 
20101221000113.000|20101221000115.000|TR0|not under why the Republican leadership 
20101221000115.000|20101221000118.000|TR0|doesn't want to pass this plan this year.

20101221000124.000|20101221000126.000|TR0|SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, (D) NEW YORK:  
20101221000126.000|20101221000129.000|TR0|This is not an entitlement.  It's is not 
20101221000129.000|20101221000131.000|TR0|an un-ended promise, it is about 100,000 
20101221000131.000|20101221000133.000|TR0|people that are eligible.  We know every 
20101221000133.000|20101221000135.000|TR0|single person who is eligible, we know who 
20101221000135.000|20101221000138.000|TR0|worked on the pile, who was there.  This 
20101221000138.000|20101221000140.000|TR0|is the health care for them and the costs 
20101221000140.000|20101221000142.000|TR0|that they need if they die.

20101221000149.000|20101221000151.000|TR0|KING:  When you stack up the approval 
20101221000151.000|20101221000153.000|TR0|ratings of our six most recent presidents, 
20101221000153.000|20101221000155.000|TR0|at the two year mark, President Obama 
20101221000155.000|20101221000158.000|TR0|ranks fifth. We'll tell you why being at 
20101221000158.000|20101221000200.000|TR0|the bottom might mean being in good 
20101221000200.000|20101221000202.000|TR0|company.  What a clue?  Think 49 out of 50.
20101221000202.000|20101221000204.000|TR0|
20101221000204.000|20101221000206.000|TR0|Let's begin though with the collision of 
20101221000206.000|20101221000209.000|TR0|politics and national security, as the 
20101221000209.000|20101221000211.000|TR0|Senate careens towards Christmas not with 
20101221000211.000|20101221000213.000|TR0|holiday cheer but with partisan sniping.  
20101221000213.000|20101221000215.000|TR0|One big subtext, a debate over whether a 
20101221000215.000|20101221000218.000|TR0|rather productive lame-duck congressional 
20101221000218.000|20101221000220.000|TR0|session is helping President Obama stage a 
20101221000220.000|20101221000222.000|TR0|year-end rally.  New CNN polling is among 
20101221000222.000|20101221000224.000|TR0|the items to debate tonight with CNN 
20101221000224.000|20101221000226.000|TR0|contributors Paul Begala, Alex Castellanos 
20101221000226.000|20101221000229.000|TR0|and John Avlon.
20101221000229.000|20101221000231.000|TR0|
20101221000231.000|20101221000233.000|TR0|But first let's ask Senior Congressional 
20101221000233.000|20101221000235.000|TR0|Correspondent Dana Bash if the Republican 
20101221000235.000|20101221000238.000|TR0|objections to the START Treaty with Russia 
20101221000238.000|20101221000240.000|TR0|are on policy or political grounds?
20101221000240.000|20101221000242.000|TR0|
20101221000242.000|20101221000244.000|TR0|Dana.
20101221000244.000|20101221000246.000|TR0|
20101221000246.000|20101221000249.000|TR0|DANA BASH, CNN SR. CONGRESSIONAL 
20101221000249.000|20101221000251.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  The answer to that is 
20101221000251.000|20101221000253.000|TR0|both.  Many Republicans have substantive 
20101221000253.000|20101221000255.000|TR0|issues with the START Treaty.  If you look 
20101221000255.000|20101221000257.000|TR0|live, right now, as we speak, on the 
20101221000257.000|20101221000300.000|TR0|Senate floor the Senate is voting tonight 
20101221000300.000|20101221000302.000|TR0|on GOP amendments, attempts to change it. 
20101221000302.000|20101221000304.000|TR0|For example, some argue it doesn't go far 
20101221000304.000|20101221000306.000|TR0|enough to putting verification systems in 
20101221000306.000|20101221000309.000|TR0|place so that Russia will live up to its 
20101221000309.000|20101221000311.000|TR0|commitments in this treaty to reduce its 
20101221000311.000|20101221000313.000|TR0|arsenal of nuclear warheads and launchers.
20101221000313.000|20101221000315.000|TR0|
20101221000315.000|20101221000317.000|TR0|But there's no question in talking to 
20101221000317.000|20101221000320.000|TR0|several Republican senators in the 
20101221000320.000|20101221000322.000|TR0|hallways today opposition is also highly 
20101221000322.000|20101221000324.000|TR0|political.  And about the atmosphere in 
20101221000324.000|20101221000326.000|TR0|these closing days of Congress where, 
20101221000326.000|20101221000329.000|TR0|John, patience is running out and tempers 
20101221000329.000|20101221000331.000|TR0|are flaring, several Republicans are 
20101221000331.000|20101221000333.000|TR0|openly angry at Democrats for using these 
20101221000333.000|20101221000335.000|TR0|last days before the Democrats lose the 
20101221000335.000|20101221000337.000|TR0|House and lose seats in the Senate to cram 
20101221000337.000|20101221000340.000|TR0|a lot of what's left on their agenda.  
20101221000340.000|20101221000342.000|TR0|Republicans also are especially angry that 
20101221000342.000|20101221000344.000|TR0|Democrats passed the "don't ask, don't 
20101221000344.000|20101221000346.000|TR0|tell" repeal this weekend.  Some are 
20101221000346.000|20101221000349.000|TR0|making it pretty clear that that is 
20101221000349.000|20101221000351.000|TR0|coloring their view of this unrelated 
20101221000351.000|20101221000353.000|TR0|START Treaty.
20101221000353.000|20101221000355.000|TR0|
20101221000355.000|20101221000357.000|TR0|KING:  Well, to try to get the votes they 
20101221000357.000|20101221000400.000|TR0|need, two-thirds of the Senate, one 
20101221000400.000|20101221000402.000|TR0|strategy the strategy today was to have 
20101221000402.000|20101221000404.000|TR0|this classified session, a closed session, 
20101221000404.000|20101221000406.000|TR0|where they could talk about the treaty in 
20101221000406.000|20101221000409.000|TR0|ways the public is no supposed to hear.  
20101221000409.000|20101221000411.000|TR0|Coming out of that session, John Kerry, 
20101221000411.000|20101221000413.000|TR0|the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
20101221000413.000|20101221000415.000|TR0|Relations Committee, said he thought it 
20101221000415.000|20101221000417.000|TR0|was helpful in building support.  Let's 
20101221000417.000|20101221000420.000|TR0|listen.

20101221000431.000|20101221000433.000|TR0|it was instructive to everybody and 
20101221000433.000|20101221000435.000|TR0|hopefully provided some facts and some 
20101221000435.000|20101221000437.000|TR0|insights that people needed that may be 
20101221000437.000|20101221000440.000|TR0|able to help them on the treaty.

20101221000451.000|20101221000453.000|TR0|Dana, Scott Brown, said he would vote for 
20101221000453.000|20101221000455.000|TR0|START.  Did they make enough progress 
20101221000455.000|20101221000457.000|TR0|among Republicans?

20101221000500.000|20101221000502.000|TR0|BASH:  It's pretty fluid now.  Democrats I 
20101221000502.000|20101221000504.000|TR0|talked to, many of them say that they 
20101221000504.000|20101221000506.000|TR0|agree with Senator Kerry they will be OK.  
20101221000506.000|20101221000509.000|TR0|The president and Secretary of State 
20101221000509.000|20101221000511.000|TR0|Hillary Clinton worked the phones all day 
20101221000511.000|20101221000513.000|TR0|today calling senators, but there are a 
20101221000513.000|20101221000515.000|TR0|lot of undecided Republicans and the 
20101221000515.000|20101221000517.000|TR0|president is now up against the GOP 
20101221000517.000|20101221000520.000|TR0|leadership in the Senate and including Jon 
20101221000520.000|20101221000522.000|TR0|Kyl of Arizona.  I'm told by GOP sources 
20101221000522.000|20101221000524.000|TR0|he is actually aggressively lobbying his 
20101221000524.000|20101221000526.000|TR0|colleagues to vote no.

20101221000546.000|20101221000548.000|TR0|To the Republican in the room first.  This 
20101221000548.000|20101221000551.000|TR0|treaty has been around for months.  You 
20101221000551.000|20101221000553.000|TR0|hear we need more time, we need more time, 
20101221000553.000|20101221000555.000|TR0|we need more time.  Is that not a fraud?
20101221000555.000|20101221000557.000|TR0|
20101221000557.000|20101221000600.000|TR0|ALEX CASTELLANOS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  
20101221000600.000|20101221000602.000|TR0|I don't know that it is a fraud.  I think 
20101221000602.000|20101221000604.000|TR0|Republicans have real substantive 
20101221000604.000|20101221000606.000|TR0|objections to this.  To understand it they 
20101221000606.000|20101221000608.000|TR0|are calling it the "Trust Putin and Let 
20101221000608.000|20101221000611.000|TR0|the Soviets Catch Up Treaty".  Because 
20101221000611.000|20101221000613.000|TR0|this basically lets the Soviets modernize 
20101221000613.000|20101221000615.000|TR0|their nuclear weapons while ours, very 
20101221000615.000|20101221000617.000|TR0|rusty, we-President Obama has already 
20101221000617.000|20101221000620.000|TR0|taken that off the table.  Said he won't, 
20101221000620.000|20101221000622.000|TR0|President Obama has already taken up the 
20101221000622.000|20101221000624.000|TR0|peace shield, defending ourselves from 
20101221000624.000|20101221000626.000|TR0|nuclear weapons off the table.
20101221000626.000|20101221000628.000|TR0|
20101221000628.000|20101221000631.000|TR0|So the Russians get to modernize their 
20101221000631.000|20101221000633.000|TR0|cruise missiles on ships and on 
20101221000633.000|20101221000635.000|TR0|submarines, don't count.  Some people, 
20101221000635.000|20101221000637.000|TR0|yes, think that a balanced world where the 
20101221000637.000|20101221000640.000|TR0|Soviets do catch up is better.
20101221000640.000|20101221000642.000|TR0|
20101221000642.000|20101221000644.000|TR0|KING:  They are the Russians now.
20101221000644.000|20101221000646.000|TR0|
20101221000646.000|20101221000648.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  The Russians.
20101221000648.000|20101221000651.000|TR0|
20101221000651.000|20101221000653.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20101221000653.000|20101221000655.000|TR0|
20101221000655.000|20101221000657.000|TR0|With Putin back you never know.
20101221000657.000|20101221000700.000|TR0|
20101221000700.000|20101221000702.000|TR0|PAUL BEGALA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I 
20101221000702.000|20101221000704.000|TR0|hate to like say history, but it's been 20 
20101221000704.000|20101221000706.000|TR0|years since they stopped being the Soviet 
20101221000706.000|20101221000708.000|TR0|Union. They are the Russians now.  That's 
20101221000708.000|20101221000711.000|TR0|a misstatement of some pretty important 
20101221000711.000|20101221000713.000|TR0|things in the treaty.
20101221000713.000|20101221000715.000|TR0|
20101221000715.000|20101221000717.000|TR0|President Obama has committed-responding 
20101221000717.000|20101221000720.000|TR0|to Senate Republicans criticisms, much of 
20101221000720.000|20101221000722.000|TR0|which is founded in substance.  I don't 
20101221000722.000|20101221000724.000|TR0|want to- maybe it is just Christmas-I 
20101221000724.000|20101221000726.000|TR0|don't want to just say they are only 
20101221000726.000|20101221000728.000|TR0|playing politics.  He's respond by saying 
20101221000728.000|20101221000731.000|TR0|we'll beef up modernization of our nuclear 
20101221000731.000|20101221000733.000|TR0|forces.  He hasn't said we won't.  He said 
20101221000733.000|20101221000735.000|TR0|we will. And he has put a huge pile of 
20101221000735.000|20101221000737.000|TR0|money on the table.
20101221000737.000|20101221000740.000|TR0|
20101221000740.000|20101221000742.000|TR0|John Kerry-this may prove to be John 
20101221000742.000|20101221000744.000|TR0|Kerry's finest hour.  The chairman of the 
20101221000744.000|20101221000746.000|TR0|Senate Foreign Relations Committee, when 
20101221000746.000|20101221000748.000|TR0|given every opportunity to take a partisan 
20101221000748.000|20101221000751.000|TR0|shot at the Republicans, some of which are 
20101221000751.000|20101221000753.000|TR0|playing politics and some of whom have 
20101221000753.000|20101221000755.000|TR0|not, he has always refused. And in today's 
20101221000755.000|20101221000757.000|TR0|session, I'm told, he did an 
20101221000757.000|20101221000800.000|TR0|extraordinarily good job of laying out the 
20101221000800.000|20101221000802.000|TR0|national security case, leaving politics 
20101221000802.000|20101221000804.000|TR0|aside.  I think this thing will get done 
20101221000804.000|20101221000806.000|TR0|and I think John Kerry-in addition to the 
20101221000806.000|20101221000808.000|TR0|president and secretary of State.
20101221000808.000|20101221000811.000|TR0|
20101221000811.000|20101221000813.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  It's not much of a political 
20101221000813.000|20101221000815.000|TR0|issue when it doesn't have that much 
20101221000815.000|20101221000817.000|TR0|political fire power.  Right now, security 
20101221000817.000|20101221000819.000|TR0|is not on the agenda.  It's all the 
20101221000819.000|20101221000822.000|TR0|economy and jobs.  So when you see a 
20101221000822.000|20101221000824.000|TR0|Republican standing up against this, with 
20101221000824.000|20101221000826.000|TR0|little political gain, it's because they 
20101221000826.000|20101221000828.000|TR0|think it's right.  Not because they are 
20101221000828.000|20101221000831.000|TR0|playing politics.
20101221000831.000|20101221000833.000|TR0|
20101221000833.000|20101221000835.000|TR0|(CROSS TALK)
20101221000835.000|20101221000837.000|TR0|
20101221000837.000|20101221000839.000|TR0|KING:  John Avlon, is that safe territory 
20101221000839.000|20101221000842.000|TR0|for them to stand up, or this is tone 
20101221000842.000|20101221000844.000|TR0|setting not just for the end of this year, 
20101221000844.000|20101221000846.000|TR0|but to carry over to the new?
20101221000846.000|20101221000848.000|TR0|
20101221000848.000|20101221000851.000|TR0|JOHN AVLON, SR. POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR, 
20101221000851.000|20101221000853.000|TR0|DAILYBEAST.COM:  No, that's right.  The 
20101221000853.000|20101221000855.000|TR0|story of this lame duck, the lame duck has 
20101221000855.000|20101221000857.000|TR0|shown it can fly.  And it has shown us 
20101221000857.000|20101221000859.000|TR0|that  divided government looking forward 
20101221000859.000|20101221000902.000|TR0|doesn't need to be gridlock.
20101221000902.000|20101221000904.000|TR0|
20101221000904.000|20101221000906.000|TR0|But this issue is important.  And to what 
20101221000906.000|20101221000908.000|TR0|Alex was just saying, the flipside is also 
20101221000908.000|20101221000911.000|TR0|true. There's no political gain in this 
20101221000911.000|20101221000913.000|TR0|and yet the president and administration 
20101221000913.000|20101221000915.000|TR0|have front loaded it because they think 
20101221000915.000|20101221000917.000|TR0|it's important.  That's why every living 
20101221000917.000|20101221000919.000|TR0|Republican secretary of State has support 
20101221000919.000|20101221000922.000|TR0|it.  Clearly they are not naive or playing 
20101221000922.000|20101221000924.000|TR0|politics. Most leaders of the military 
20101221000924.000|20101221000926.000|TR0|have supported it.  By my count I think we 
20101221000926.000|20101221000928.000|TR0|are at least four Republican senators.  
20101221000928.000|20101221000931.000|TR0|This thing has a broad base of support 
20101221000931.000|20101221000933.000|TR0|because people don't and they should not 
20101221000933.000|20101221000935.000|TR0|play partisan politics with nuclear arms 
20101221000935.000|20101221000937.000|TR0|treaties.  This is the right thing to do, 
20101221000937.000|20101221000939.000|TR0|it would be a good way to go out in the 
20101221000939.000|20101221000942.000|TR0|lame duck.  This should move forward.
20101221000942.000|20101221000944.000|TR0|
20101221000944.000|20101221000946.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  Well, Putin is supporting it 
20101221000946.000|20101221000948.000|TR0|because he thinks it's in his interest, 
20101221000948.000|20101221000951.000|TR0|too.  That makes me-if we had looked in 
20101221000951.000|20101221000953.000|TR0|his eyes, too.
20101221000953.000|20101221000955.000|TR0|
20101221000955.000|20101221000957.000|TR0|KING:  For anybody at home saying, what's 
20101221000957.000|20101221000959.000|TR0|in this treaty?  Let me just break it 
20101221000959.000|20101221001002.000|TR0|down.  Maybe you don't follow nuclear arms 
20101221001002.000|20101221001004.000|TR0|agreements. Or 20 years after the decline, 
20101221001004.000|20101221001006.000|TR0|but if you look here, red are your known 
20101221001006.000|20101221001008.000|TR0|nuclear powers, orange are nuclear 
20101221001008.000|20101221001011.000|TR0|nations, as well, yellow are suspected 
20101221001011.000|20101221001013.000|TR0|nuclear nations.  Let's take a quick look 
20101221001013.000|20101221001015.000|TR0|at this START Treaty.
20101221001015.000|20101221001017.000|TR0|
20101221001017.000|20101221001019.000|TR0|These are what these countries have around 
20101221001019.000|20101221001022.000|TR0|the world.  You see the United States and 
20101221001022.000|20101221001024.000|TR0|Russia are the big nuclear powers around 
20101221001024.000|20101221001026.000|TR0|the world.  Now, let's take a look what 
20101221001026.000|20101221001028.000|TR0|this treaty would do.  This is the old 
20101221001028.000|20101221001031.000|TR0|START Treaty.  We started out up here.  We 
20101221001031.000|20101221001033.000|TR0|got down to 6,000. This is where the two 
20101221001033.000|20101221001035.000|TR0|countries are today, the United States has 
20101221001035.000|20101221001037.000|TR0|a little lower number than Russia.  The 
20101221001037.000|20101221001039.000|TR0|goal of this treaty is to get down to 1550 
20101221001039.000|20101221001042.000|TR0|on each country side.  And as Paul said, 
20101221001042.000|20101221001044.000|TR0|the president I think has put up about $4 
20101221001044.000|20101221001046.000|TR0|billion for the modernization.
20101221001046.000|20101221001048.000|TR0|
20101221001048.000|20101221001051.000|TR0|There's one of the concerns that Senator 
20101221001051.000|20101221001053.000|TR0|Corker, of Tennessee, is writing a 
20101221001053.000|20101221001055.000|TR0|nonbinding, essentially they want to put 
20101221001055.000|20101221001057.000|TR0|record that the Senate is worried about 
20101221001057.000|20101221001059.000|TR0|missile defense, they are worried about 
20101221001059.000|20101221001102.000|TR0|some language in the preamble, because 
20101221001102.000|20101221001104.000|TR0|they have heard some things said by 
20101221001104.000|20101221001106.000|TR0|Russian officials they don't like.  So 
20101221001106.000|20101221001108.000|TR0|they are essentially saying, well, here's 
20101221001108.000|20101221001110.000|TR0|what we don't like.  And we will work it 
20101221001110.000|20101221001113.000|TR0|all out.  Will this be done?
20101221001113.000|20101221001115.000|TR0|
20101221001115.000|20101221001117.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  It is moving in that 
20101221001117.000|20101221001119.000|TR0|direction.  They are probably going to get 
20101221001119.000|20101221001122.000|TR0|enough Republicans to get this over the 
20101221001122.000|20101221001124.000|TR0|top, like they have gotten a few other 
20101221001124.000|20101221001126.000|TR0|issues, "don't ask, don't tell", in the 
20101221001126.000|20101221001128.000|TR0|past week.  But, again, these are 
20101221001128.000|20101221001130.000|TR0|substantive objections.  The Russians do 
20101221001130.000|20101221001133.000|TR0|mod-their assembly is saying we see this 
20101221001133.000|20101221001135.000|TR0|treaty a little differently than you do.  
20101221001135.000|20101221001137.000|TR0|These things don't apply to cruise 
20101221001137.000|20101221001139.000|TR0|missiles on subs, on ships, and rail. 
20101221001139.000|20101221001142.000|TR0|which is where the Soviet arsenal is 
20101221001142.000|20101221001144.000|TR0|growing-Russian.
20101221001144.000|20101221001146.000|TR0|
20101221001146.000|20101221001148.000|TR0|KING:  If they violate the treaty, I 
20101221001148.000|20101221001150.000|TR0|assume we could come back.
20101221001150.000|20101221001153.000|TR0|
20101221001153.000|20101221001155.000|TR0|All right.  So let's put this in the 
20101221001155.000|20101221001157.000|TR0|year-end political context. I want to 
20101221001157.000|20101221001159.000|TR0|show, right here.  We did some new 
20101221001159.000|20101221001202.000|TR0|polling.  CNN/Opinion Research Corporation 
20101221001202.000|20101221001204.000|TR0|polling and it shows the president's 
20101221001204.000|20101221001206.000|TR0|approval rating at 48 percent.  That's not 
20101221001206.000|20101221001208.000|TR0|great.  But it is up a little bit from 
20101221001208.000|20101221001210.000|TR0|where he was a couple of months ago, as we 
20101221001210.000|20101221001213.000|TR0|get to the end of the year.
20101221001213.000|20101221001215.000|TR0|
20101221001215.000|20101221001217.000|TR0|But let's break it down among groups on 
20101221001217.000|20101221001219.000|TR0|the political spectrum. Among liberals 72 
20101221001219.000|20101221001222.000|TR0|percent approve, 27 percent disapprove.  
20101221001222.000|20101221001224.000|TR0|The president's number among liberals are 
20101221001224.000|20101221001226.000|TR0|down a little bit from last month.  You 
20101221001226.000|20101221001228.000|TR0|can say, tax deal, they don't like right 
20101221001228.000|20101221001230.000|TR0|there, maybe. We'll watch if they go up.  
20101221001230.000|20101221001233.000|TR0|Moderates 60 percent approve, 36 percent 
20101221001233.000|20101221001235.000|TR0|disapprove.  Conservatives 22 percent 
20101221001235.000|20101221001237.000|TR0|approve, 72 percent disapprove. That 
20101221001237.000|20101221001239.000|TR0|number has been pretty constant for a very 
20101221001239.000|20101221001242.000|TR0|long time.
20101221001242.000|20101221001244.000|TR0|
20101221001244.000|20101221001246.000|TR0|John Avlon, is the president at least 
20101221001246.000|20101221001248.000|TR0|trying and do you see some evidence that 
20101221001248.000|20101221001250.000|TR0|he's recapturing a bit of the middle?
20101221001250.000|20101221001253.000|TR0|
20101221001253.000|20101221001255.000|TR0|AVLON:  This poll provides that evidence.  
20101221001255.000|20101221001257.000|TR0|He's up at least 5 points among 
20101221001257.000|20101221001259.000|TR0|self-identified centrists, which gets to 
20101221001259.000|20101221001302.000|TR0|the plateau, actually to the percentage of 
20101221001302.000|20101221001304.000|TR0|centrists that voted for him in 2008. It 
20101221001304.000|20101221001306.000|TR0|shows that his leadership on tax cuts 
20101221001306.000|20101221001308.000|TR0|trying to form that compromise, even 
20101221001308.000|20101221001310.000|TR0|though folks on the far left and far right 
20101221001310.000|20101221001313.000|TR0|didn't support him, he has increased his 
20101221001313.000|20101221001315.000|TR0|support with the center.  And that is 
20101221001315.000|20101221001317.000|TR0|essential going into this next election 
20101221001317.000|20101221001319.000|TR0|year.
20101221001319.000|20101221001322.000|TR0|
20101221001322.000|20101221001324.000|TR0|KING:  Yes, among independents it's still 
20101221001324.000|20101221001326.000|TR0|41 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove, 
20101221001326.000|20101221001328.000|TR0|Paul.  So, he's getting moderate 
20101221001328.000|20101221001330.000|TR0|Democrats, but the people who just helped 
20101221001330.000|20101221001333.000|TR0|the Republicans get from 40 to 63 seats in 
20101221001333.000|20101221001335.000|TR0|the House, the independent voters, they 
20101221001335.000|20101221001337.000|TR0|are not so sure still.
20101221001337.000|20101221001339.000|TR0|
20101221001339.000|20101221001341.000|TR0|BEGALA:  That's right.  I think the 
20101221001341.000|20101221001344.000|TR0|president won't get them back just by 
20101221001344.000|20101221001346.000|TR0|cutting deals with the Republicans.  So, 
20101221001346.000|20101221001348.000|TR0|the Democrats cutting are compromising.  
20101221001348.000|20101221001350.000|TR0|He has to move the needle on jobs.  That's 
20101221001350.000|20101221001353.000|TR0|what I've been saying for two years, since 
20101221001353.000|20101221001355.000|TR0|the day the man took office.  We have not 
20101221001355.000|20101221001357.000|TR0|moved the needle on jobs, sufficiently.  
20101221001357.000|20101221001359.000|TR0|He has to do that.
20101221001359.000|20101221001401.000|TR0|
20101221001401.000|20101221001404.000|TR0|By the administration's calculations the 
20101221001404.000|20101221001406.000|TR0|deal he just cut will create 2.2 million 
20101221001406.000|20101221001408.000|TR0|jobs, OK?  By the Congressional Budget 
20101221001408.000|20101221001410.000|TR0|Office calculation $858 billion, by my 
20101221001410.000|20101221001413.000|TR0|seventh grader's Charlie's calculations, 
20101221001413.000|20101221001415.000|TR0|that's $390,000 per job.  You can pass 
20101221001415.000|20101221001417.000|TR0|something pretty easily through Congress 
20101221001417.000|20101221001419.000|TR0|if you cut taxes and raise spending.  I 
20101221001419.000|20101221001421.000|TR0|mean, a monkey could do that.  George W. 
20101221001421.000|20101221001424.000|TR0|Bush even could do that.  But Barack 
20101221001424.000|20101221001426.000|TR0|Obama?  He needs to do better.
20101221001426.000|20101221001428.000|TR0|

20101221001437.000|20101221001439.000|TR0|KING:  Go ahead, John.
20101221001439.000|20101221001441.000|TR0|
20101221001441.000|20101221001444.000|TR0|AVLON:  Barack Obama will actually have to 
20101221001444.000|20101221001446.000|TR0|lead in cutting the deficit and the debt 
20101221001446.000|20101221001448.000|TR0|to win those independents back.
20101221001448.000|20101221001450.000|TR0|
20101221001450.000|20101221001453.000|TR0|BEGALA:  He has to generate jobs.

20101221001455.000|20101221001457.000|TR0|KING:  Next year is going to be the tough 
20101221001457.000|20101221001459.000|TR0|choices.  You're being very, very polite 
20101221001459.000|20101221001501.000|TR0|there, it kind of scares me a little bit.  
20101221001501.000|20101221001504.000|TR0|You are just standing there?
20101221001504.000|20101221001506.000|TR0|

20101221001510.000|20101221001513.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  Interestingly enough the 
20101221001513.000|20101221001515.000|TR0|other bad numbers in these polls are for 
20101221001515.000|20101221001517.000|TR0|Republicans.  When you look at the rest of 
20101221001517.000|20101221001519.000|TR0|that survey, what the survey says is that 
20101221001519.000|20101221001521.000|TR0|we trust Republicans, the country trusts 
20101221001521.000|20101221001524.000|TR0|Republicans to stop Barack Obama, to hit 
20101221001524.000|20101221001526.000|TR0|the brake pedal.  Take away his car keys 
20101221001526.000|20101221001528.000|TR0|periodically, when he is spending too 
20101221001528.000|20101221001530.000|TR0|much.  But they don't trust Republicans to 
20101221001530.000|20101221001533.000|TR0|lead.

20101221001535.000|20101221001537.000|TR0|KING:  We'll look more closely at those 
20101221001537.000|20101221001539.000|TR0|when we come back.  These guys are going 
20101221001539.000|20101221001541.000|TR0|to stay with us, but when we come back 
20101221001541.000|20101221001544.000|TR0|we'll have New York Senator Kristen 
20101221001544.000|20101221001546.000|TR0|Gillibrand, the Democrat of New York, who 
20101221001546.000|20101221001548.000|TR0|says she cannot understand, cannot 
20101221001548.000|20101221001550.000|TR0|understand, why the Republican leadership 
20101221001550.000|20101221001553.000|TR0|won't approve legislation to take care of 
20101221001553.000|20101221001555.000|TR0|9/11 first responders.

20101221001601.000|20101221001604.000|TR0|KING:  One of the final question marks for 
20101221001604.000|20101221001606.000|TR0|this year-end session of Congress is 
20101221001606.000|20101221001608.000|TR0|whether a multi-billion dollar plan to 
20101221001608.000|20101221001610.000|TR0|help 9/11 responders will pass.  Hoping to 
20101221001610.000|20101221001613.000|TR0|break the stalemate the measure's two main 
20101221001613.000|20101221001615.000|TR0|sponsors in the Senate have made some 
20101221001615.000|20101221001617.000|TR0|changes.  The 10-year price tag now $6.2 
20101221001617.000|20101221001619.000|TR0|billion, down from $7.4 billion, in the 
20101221001619.000|20101221001621.000|TR0|earlier version. And it has now paid for 
20101221001621.000|20101221001624.000|TR0|differently with a mix of excise and visa 
20101221001624.000|20101221001626.000|TR0|fees the sponsors believe are less 
20101221001626.000|20101221001628.000|TR0|controversial than the earlier plan to 
20101221001628.000|20101221001630.000|TR0|close to some corporate tax loopholes.  
20101221001630.000|20101221001632.000|TR0|But will it pass before the Senate goes 
20101221001632.000|20101221001635.000|TR0|home for the holidays?

20101221001641.000|20101221001644.000|TR0|
20101221001644.000|20101221001646.000|TR0|Senator, you have made these changes.  You 
20101221001646.000|20101221001648.000|TR0|think it is more palatable, you think it 
20101221001648.000|20101221001650.000|TR0|should answer at least some of the 
20101221001650.000|20101221001652.000|TR0|Republican criticism.  The question is, 
20101221001652.000|20101221001655.000|TR0|with the clock ticking, can you get this 
20101221001655.000|20101221001657.000|TR0|done before Senate goes home?
20101221001657.000|20101221001659.000|TR0|
20101221001659.000|20101221001701.000|TR0|KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, (D) NEW YORK:  I think 
20101221001701.000|20101221001704.000|TR0|we can.  We obviously need people of 
20101221001704.000|20101221001706.000|TR0|goodwill to come together to vote for this 
20101221001706.000|20101221001708.000|TR0|bill and do it in a timely way.  But I 
20101221001708.000|20101221001710.000|TR0|think it can be done.  Because, John, just 
20101221001710.000|20101221001712.000|TR0|remember, this bill is about the first 
20101221001712.000|20101221001715.000|TR0|responders.  This bill is about the people 
20101221001715.000|20101221001717.000|TR0|who literally ran up the Towers when 
20101221001717.000|20101221001719.000|TR0|people were rushing down.  It's about the 
20101221001719.000|20101221001721.000|TR0|men and the women who worked at that pile, 
20101221001721.000|20101221001724.000|TR0|first looking for survivors, then looking 
20101221001724.000|20101221001726.000|TR0|for remains and doing the cleanup. They 
20101221001726.000|20101221001728.000|TR0|answered the call to duty when we asked 
20101221001728.000|20101221001730.000|TR0|them to come.  So now literally some of 
20101221001730.000|20101221001732.000|TR0|these men and women are dying.  We need to 
20101221001732.000|20101221001735.000|TR0|stand by them and give them the health 
20101221001735.000|20101221001737.000|TR0|care they need to literally survive.
20101221001737.000|20101221001739.000|TR0|
20101221001739.000|20101221001741.000|TR0|KING:  Help people understand the 
20101221001741.000|20101221001744.000|TR0|specifics of this and then the substance.  
20101221001744.000|20101221001746.000|TR0|Then we'll talk about the politics, in the 
20101221001746.000|20101221001748.000|TR0|sense, many would think-and if they are 
20101221001748.000|20101221001750.000|TR0|not paying very close attention, they 
20101221001750.000|20101221001752.000|TR0|might think, of course, we want to give 
20101221001752.000|20101221001755.000|TR0|them health care, of course, we want to 
20101221001755.000|20101221001757.000|TR0|help them, but weren't they policemen and 
20101221001757.000|20101221001759.000|TR0|firemen?  Didn't they have a generous 
20101221001759.000|20101221001801.000|TR0|benefits package?  Why is this necessary?
20101221001801.000|20101221001804.000|TR0|
20101221001804.000|20101221001806.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  Well, they do have benefit 
20101221001806.000|20101221001808.000|TR0|plans and their benefit plans, their 
20101221001808.000|20101221001810.000|TR0|health care pays out first.  Their 
20101221001810.000|20101221001812.000|TR0|workmen's comp is second.  Any relief they 
20101221001812.000|20101221001815.000|TR0|get from any settlement, court settlement, 
20101221001815.000|20101221001817.000|TR0|comes in third.  And then this fund is 
20101221001817.000|20101221001819.000|TR0|here because for a lot of these men and 
20101221001819.000|20101221001821.000|TR0|women they are at their lifetime maximums 
20101221001821.000|20101221001824.000|TR0|for health care. And some of these 
20101221001824.000|20101221001826.000|TR0|families are literally being forced into 
20101221001826.000|20101221001828.000|TR0|bankruptcy because they can't afford all 
20101221001828.000|20101221001830.000|TR0|the health care costs.
20101221001830.000|20101221001832.000|TR0|
20101221001832.000|20101221001835.000|TR0|So this bill would cover those first 
20101221001835.000|20101221001837.000|TR0|responders who have coverage and are now 
20101221001837.000|20101221001839.000|TR0|over the limit.  It covers first 
20101221001839.000|20101221001841.000|TR0|responders who were perhaps retired, and 
20101221001841.000|20101221001844.000|TR0|were volunteering.  It covers the 
20101221001844.000|20101221001846.000|TR0|construction workers, and all the people 
20101221001846.000|20101221001848.000|TR0|that were on the pile, and the volunteers. 
20101221001848.000|20101221001850.000|TR0|It also helps some of the families who 
20101221001850.000|20101221001852.000|TR0|live just at ground zero, because some of 
20101221001852.000|20101221001855.000|TR0|the kids, in particularly the children, 
20101221001855.000|20101221001857.000|TR0|they are particularly vulnerable to the 
20101221001857.000|20101221001859.000|TR0|toxins that were released.  And a lot of 
20101221001859.000|20101221001901.000|TR0|them are now are suffering from asthma and 
20101221001901.000|20101221001903.000|TR0|other grave health effects.
20101221001903.000|20101221001906.000|TR0|
20101221001906.000|20101221001908.000|TR0|So what this does is makes sure they all 
20101221001908.000|20101221001910.000|TR0|have access to the health care they need.  
20101221001910.000|20101221001912.000|TR0|This is a capped fund, John.  This is not 
20101221001912.000|20101221001915.000|TR0|an entitlement.  It's not an un-ended 
20101221001915.000|20101221001917.000|TR0|promise.  It is about 100,000 people that 
20101221001917.000|20101221001919.000|TR0|are eligible.  We know every single person 
20101221001919.000|20101221001921.000|TR0|who is eligible.  We know who worked on 
20101221001921.000|20101221001923.000|TR0|the pile, who was there.  This is the 
20101221001923.000|20101221001926.000|TR0|health care for them and the costs that 
20101221001926.000|20101221001928.000|TR0|they need if they die.
20101221001928.000|20101221001930.000|TR0|
20101221001930.000|20101221001932.000|TR0|KING:  And so why, then, I want to you 
20101221001932.000|20101221001935.000|TR0|listen to Senator Jon Kyl. He is the 
20101221001935.000|20101221001937.000|TR0|number two in the Republicans leadership.  
20101221001937.000|20101221001939.000|TR0|Why do Republicans have so many questions? 
20101221001939.000|20101221001941.000|TR0| Let's listen to Senator Kyl.
20101221001941.000|20101221001943.000|TR0|

20101221001948.000|20101221001950.000|TR0|SEN. JON KYL, (R) ARIZONA:  First question 
20101221001950.000|20101221001952.000|TR0|is, is it amendable, or is it a take it or 
20101221001952.000|20101221001955.000|TR0|leave it proposition.  The bill has not 
20101221001955.000|20101221001957.000|TR0|been through committee.  There are 
20101221001957.000|20101221001959.000|TR0|problems with it.  And I think the first 
20101221001959.000|20101221002001.000|TR0|thing Republicans will ask is, do we have 
20101221002001.000|20101221002003.000|TR0|a chance to fix any problems that may 
20101221002003.000|20101221002006.000|TR0|exist with it?  It's a lot of money and so 
20101221002006.000|20101221002008.000|TR0|my early response is that I'm skeptical 
20101221002008.000|20101221002010.000|TR0|about that bill.
20101221002010.000|20101221002012.000|TR0|

20101221002017.000|20101221002019.000|TR0|KING:  Would they have a chance.
20101221002019.000|20101221002021.000|TR0|
20101221002021.000|20101221002023.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  Well, we have been working on 
20101221002023.000|20101221002026.000|TR0|this bill for years now and this 
20101221002026.000|20101221002028.000|TR0|particular bill has been through 22 
20101221002028.000|20101221002030.000|TR0|hearings, one in the Senate, 21 in the 
20101221002030.000|20101221002032.000|TR0|House.  It's been through every committee 
20101221002032.000|20101221002035.000|TR0|of jurisdiction on the House side.  And 
20101221002035.000|20101221002037.000|TR0|what we are looking at right now is a 
20101221002037.000|20101221002039.000|TR0|House bill that was amended by 
20101221002039.000|20101221002041.000|TR0|Republicans.  All the Republican ideas 
20101221002041.000|20101221002043.000|TR0|that needed to go in that bill got in that 
20101221002043.000|20101221002046.000|TR0|bill.  What we're looking at is a bill 
20101221002046.000|20101221002048.000|TR0|that's very bipartisan.
20101221002048.000|20101221002050.000|TR0|
20101221002050.000|20101221002052.000|TR0|When I put this bill in last year I've 
20101221002052.000|20101221002055.000|TR0|been working over the last year to get the 
20101221002055.000|20101221002057.000|TR0|support on the Senate side.  And we had a 
20101221002057.000|20101221002059.000|TR0|hearing in the Health Committee that was 
20101221002059.000|20101221002101.000|TR0|open for people to try to work on the 
20101221002101.000|20101221002103.000|TR0|bill, to change the bill, to make any 
20101221002103.000|20101221002106.000|TR0|additions.  There were no request for 
20101221002106.000|20101221002108.000|TR0|changes.
20101221002108.000|20101221002110.000|TR0|
20101221002110.000|20101221002112.000|TR0|KING:  So, then why would Senator Kyl say, 
20101221002112.000|20101221002115.000|TR0|I'm still skeptical. It is that just pure 
20101221002115.000|20101221002117.000|TR0|politics?  Does he have legitimate 
20101221002117.000|20101221002119.000|TR0|questions?
20101221002119.000|20101221002121.000|TR0|
20101221002121.000|20101221002123.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  I don't know if he has 
20101221002123.000|20101221002126.000|TR0|legitimate questions because we have been 
20101221002126.000|20101221002128.000|TR0|engaging Republicans now for several 
20101221002128.000|20101221002130.000|TR0|months.  His concerns have never come up.  
20101221002130.000|20101221002132.000|TR0|He hasn't articulated anything he wants 
20101221002132.000|20101221002135.000|TR0|changed in the bill.
20101221002135.000|20101221002137.000|TR0|
20101221002137.000|20101221002139.000|TR0|But what we can know about this bill is it 
20101221002139.000|20101221002141.000|TR0|has been through all these committees.  It 
20101221002141.000|20101221002143.000|TR0|has had the time and effort where 
20101221002143.000|20101221002146.000|TR0|amendments went into it.  Because this is 
20101221002146.000|20101221002148.000|TR0|a House bill that has been worked on, 
20101221002148.000|20101221002150.000|TR0|literally, for years.  And on the Senate 
20101221002150.000|20101221002152.000|TR0|side, Secretary Clinton worked with 
20101221002152.000|20101221002154.000|TR0|Senator Enzi for years on these issues.  
20101221002154.000|20101221002157.000|TR0|And they really had a chance to talk 
20101221002157.000|20101221002159.000|TR0|through what they want to see in a bill.  
20101221002159.000|20101221002201.000|TR0|When I talk to Senator Enzi he really 
20101221002201.000|20101221002203.000|TR0|wants accountability.  What this bill does 
20101221002203.000|20101221002206.000|TR0|is takes the past programs, we had about 
20101221002206.000|20101221002208.000|TR0|six programs in place, that were put 
20101221002208.000|20101221002210.000|TR0|together very hastily after 9/11, that we 
20101221002210.000|20101221002212.000|TR0|are literally going to remove and replace 
20101221002212.000|20101221002214.000|TR0|it with one program that is 100 percent 
20101221002214.000|20101221002217.000|TR0|transparent and 100 percent accountable.
20101221002217.000|20101221002219.000|TR0|
20101221002219.000|20101221002221.000|TR0|So it addresses some of the underlying 
20101221002221.000|20101221002223.000|TR0|issues that I have heard from colleagues 
20101221002223.000|20101221002226.000|TR0|in the past.  I think it's a strong bill.  
20101221002226.000|20101221002228.000|TR0|And at the end of the day, John, this is 
20101221002228.000|20101221002230.000|TR0|about our first responders.  It's about 
20101221002230.000|20101221002232.000|TR0|the people who literally answered the call 
20101221002232.000|20101221002234.000|TR0|to duty.  And they came and they helped 
20101221002234.000|20101221002237.000|TR0|and did what was asked.  And the least we 
20101221002237.000|20101221002239.000|TR0|can do right now is to give them the 
20101221002239.000|20101221002241.000|TR0|health care they need.
20101221002241.000|20101221002243.000|TR0|
20101221002243.000|20101221002246.000|TR0|KING:  Let me ask you a couple of other 
20101221002246.000|20101221002248.000|TR0|questions.  Some of them related, in an 
20101221002248.000|20101221002250.000|TR0|indirect way to 9/11.  As you know for 
20101221002250.000|20101221002252.000|TR0|months there's been this controversy about 
20101221002252.000|20101221002254.000|TR0|this mosque and cultural center that the 
20101221002254.000|20101221002257.000|TR0|supporters wan to build right near ground 
20101221002257.000|20101221002259.000|TR0|zero.  There have been reports in the last 
20101221002259.000|20101221002301.000|TR0|72 hours or so that the King of Saudi 
20101221002301.000|20101221002303.000|TR0|Arabia has some compromise plan.  That he 
20101221002303.000|20101221002306.000|TR0|would buy a different building, a bit 
20101221002306.000|20101221002308.000|TR0|further away, and we haven't been able to 
20101221002308.000|20101221002310.000|TR0|get any official confirmation that such a 
20101221002310.000|20101221002312.000|TR0|plan actually exists.  Have you heard 
20101221002312.000|20101221002314.000|TR0|anything about this?
20101221002314.000|20101221002317.000|TR0|
20101221002317.000|20101221002319.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  I've not heard about it.  But 
20101221002319.000|20101221002321.000|TR0|I know that our governor, Governor 
20101221002321.000|20101221002323.000|TR0|Paterson, was been working on alternative 
20101221002323.000|20101221002326.000|TR0|solutions.  And that this may be something 
20101221002326.000|20101221002328.000|TR0|that has come of those efforts.
20101221002328.000|20101221002330.000|TR0|
20101221002330.000|20101221002332.000|TR0|KING:  One much your colleagues in the New 
20101221002332.000|20101221002334.000|TR0|York delegation, Republican Pete King, on 
20101221002334.000|20101221002337.000|TR0|the House side, will be the chairman of 
20101221002337.000|20101221002339.000|TR0|the Homeland Security Committee when the 
20101221002339.000|20101221002341.000|TR0|new Congress comes back in January.  He 
20101221002341.000|20101221002343.000|TR0|says he wants to have hearings on 
20101221002343.000|20101221002346.000|TR0|radicalization of the American-Muslim 
20101221002346.000|20101221002348.000|TR0|community.  Is that necessary in your view?
20101221002348.000|20101221002350.000|TR0|
20101221002350.000|20101221002352.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  Well, he's the chairman of 
20101221002352.000|20101221002354.000|TR0|the Homeland Security Committee and he'll 
20101221002354.000|20101221002357.000|TR0|move forward on his agenda about what he 
20101221002357.000|20101221002359.000|TR0|wants to learn about.  Let me say a word 
20101221002359.000|20101221002401.000|TR0|about Congressman King.  I can tell you 
20101221002401.000|20101221002403.000|TR0|he's been the best supporter, the greatest 
20101221002403.000|20101221002406.000|TR0|advocate on this issue and he has helped 
20101221002406.000|20101221002408.000|TR0|me immeasurably in the Senate.       He 
20101221002408.000|20101221002410.000|TR0|has not only called my Senate Republican 
20101221002410.000|20101221002412.000|TR0|colleagues, he's called Mitch McConnell, 
20101221002412.000|20101221002414.000|TR0|he has called the leadership.  And he's 
20101221002414.000|20101221002417.000|TR0|really beseeching them to come together 
20101221002417.000|20101221002419.000|TR0|and leave partisan politics aside to 
20101221002419.000|20101221002421.000|TR0|support this 9/11 bill.  I can really show 
20101221002421.000|20101221002423.000|TR0|extraordinary gratitude for his courage 
20101221002423.000|20101221002425.000|TR0|and his advocacy.
20101221002425.000|20101221002428.000|TR0|
20101221002428.000|20101221002430.000|TR0|At the end of the day, Peter King and I 
20101221002430.000|20101221002432.000|TR0|agree on one thing.  We want to protect 
20101221002432.000|20101221002434.000|TR0|this country.  We want to protect New 
20101221002434.000|20101221002437.000|TR0|York.  And he has shown how much he cares 
20101221002437.000|20101221002439.000|TR0|about this country and New York, in all of 
20101221002439.000|20101221002441.000|TR0|his efforts.
20101221002441.000|20101221002443.000|TR0|
20101221002443.000|20101221002445.000|TR0|KING:  Do you think that's a necessary 
20101221002445.000|20101221002448.000|TR0|review or could inflame tension?
20101221002448.000|20101221002450.000|TR0|
20101221002450.000|20101221002452.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  Well, I need to speak to 
20101221002452.000|20101221002454.000|TR0|Peter about it.  I want to hear what he is 
20101221002454.000|20101221002457.000|TR0|hoping achieve, through his hearings.  
20101221002457.000|20101221002459.000|TR0|What kind of testimony he hopes to have.  
20101221002459.000|20101221002501.000|TR0|I do know that Peter King is very focused 
20101221002501.000|20101221002503.000|TR0|on not only keeping New York safe, but 
20101221002503.000|20101221002505.000|TR0|really fighting terrorism across the board.
20101221002505.000|20101221002508.000|TR0|
20101221002508.000|20101221002510.000|TR0|KING:  Help me under a little bit of the 
20101221002510.000|20101221002512.000|TR0|post-election tug-of-war and discussion 
20101221002512.000|20101221002514.000|TR0|within the Democratic Party.  As you know 
20101221002514.000|20101221002517.000|TR0|there are many liberals who think the 
20101221002517.000|20101221002519.000|TR0|president just sold them out by cutting 
20101221002519.000|20101221002521.000|TR0|this tax compromise.  They think he should 
20101221002521.000|20101221002523.000|TR0|have fought for a better deal.  They think 
20101221002523.000|20101221002525.000|TR0|he should have never extended the tax cuts 
20101221002525.000|20101221002528.000|TR0|for the wealthy.  They think the estate 
20101221002528.000|20101221002530.000|TR0|tax plan component of this plan is a give 
20101221002530.000|20101221002532.000|TR0|away to the rich.  How feisty and how 
20101221002532.000|20101221002534.000|TR0|bitter-I guess-is the debate especially 
20101221002534.000|20101221002537.000|TR0|among liberals, about the president right 
20101221002537.000|20101221002539.000|TR0|now?
20101221002539.000|20101221002541.000|TR0|
20101221002541.000|20101221002543.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  Well, one thing is clear.  
20101221002543.000|20101221002545.000|TR0|The president cares deeply about this 
20101221002545.000|20101221002548.000|TR0|economy.  He's so committed to making sure 
20101221002548.000|20101221002550.000|TR0|we grow this economy.  We focus on middle 
20101221002550.000|20101221002552.000|TR0|class tax cuts, tax cuts for small 
20101221002552.000|20101221002554.000|TR0|businesses, because small businesses 
20101221002554.000|20101221002557.000|TR0|create two-thirds of all new jobs.  That's 
20101221002557.000|20101221002559.000|TR0|the is going to be the secret to actually 
20101221002559.000|20101221002601.000|TR0|unleashing America's potential and making 
20101221002601.000|20101221002603.000|TR0|sure this economy can grow again.
20101221002603.000|20101221002605.000|TR0|
20101221002605.000|20101221002608.000|TR0|That being said, I voted against the 
20101221002608.000|20101221002610.000|TR0|compromise because I believed that there 
20101221002610.000|20101221002612.000|TR0|was too much money being spent, too much 
20101221002612.000|20101221002614.000|TR0|wasteful spending in areas that don't 
20101221002614.000|20101221002617.000|TR0|create jobs.  I was most worried about tax 
20101221002617.000|20101221002619.000|TR0|breaks for a million plus.  That was about 
20101221002619.000|20101221002621.000|TR0|$60 billion.  I was also concerned about 
20101221002621.000|20101221002623.000|TR0|changing the cutoff for the estate tax 
20101221002623.000|20101221002625.000|TR0|from $3.5 million per individual to $5 
20101221002625.000|20101221002628.000|TR0|million per individual.  That cost about 
20101221002628.000|20101221002630.000|TR0|$70 billion.  And so that $130 billion to 
20101221002630.000|20101221002632.000|TR0|me is money that's being invested in the 
20101221002632.000|20101221002634.000|TR0|wrong way.  It is not being invested in 
20101221002634.000|20101221002637.000|TR0|job creation. It is not being invested in 
20101221002637.000|20101221002639.000|TR0|economic growth.  That's why I chose not 
20101221002639.000|20101221002641.000|TR0|support package.  But I know the president 
20101221002641.000|20101221002643.000|TR0|is dedicated to fixing this economy.  That 
20101221002643.000|20101221002645.000|TR0|was the deal that he reached.
20101221002645.000|20101221002648.000|TR0|
20101221002648.000|20101221002650.000|TR0|KING:  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, 
20101221002650.000|20101221002652.000|TR0|Democrat of New York, I appreciate your 
20101221002652.000|20101221002654.000|TR0|time today.
20101221002654.000|20101221002657.000|TR0|
20101221002657.000|20101221002659.000|TR0|GILLIBRAND:  Thank you.
20101221002659.000|20101221002701.000|TR0|
20101221002701.000|20101221002703.000|TR0|KING:  Thank you.

20101221002705.000|20101221002708.000|TR0|When we come back, the politics of the 
20101221002708.000|20101221002710.000|TR0|9/11 responders bill.  And later now that 
20101221002710.000|20101221002712.000|TR0|Congress has voted to repeal the 
20101221002712.000|20101221002714.000|TR0|military's "don't ask, don't tell policy" 
20101221002714.000|20101221002716.000|TR0|how long should it be before gays are 
20101221002716.000|20101221002719.000|TR0|allowed to serve openly?
20101221002719.000|20101221002721.000|TR0|
20101221002721.000|20101221002723.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20101221002723.000|20101221002725.000|TR0|
20101221002725.000|20101221002728.000|TR0|KING:  Can Republicans sustain opposition 
20101221002728.000|20101221002730.000|TR0|to that 9/11 first responders bill?  And 
20101221002730.000|20101221002732.000|TR0|is the president having a little bit of a 
20101221002732.000|20101221002734.000|TR0|year- end come back?  Let's get back to 
20101221002734.000|20101221002736.000|TR0|our conversation with John Avlon, Paul 
20101221002736.000|20101221002739.000|TR0|Begala, and Alex Castellanos.
20101221002739.000|20101221002741.000|TR0|
20101221002741.000|20101221002743.000|TR0|John, to you first, in New York, on this 
20101221002743.000|20101221002745.000|TR0|question of this 9/11 bill:  Can the 
20101221002745.000|20101221002748.000|TR0|Republicans hold this and make it kick 
20101221002748.000|20101221002750.000|TR0|over to next year?  And as I ask the 
20101221002750.000|20101221002752.000|TR0|question what struck me in the last 24 to 
20101221002752.000|20101221002754.000|TR0|48 hours, or so, is watching one of the 
20101221002754.000|20101221002756.000|TR0|most influential voices in this country, 
20101221002756.000|20101221002759.000|TR0|when it comes to swaying the Republicans 
20101221002759.000|20101221002801.000|TR0|and that would be the FOX News Channel.  
20101221002801.000|20101221002803.000|TR0|They have gone show after show saying why 
20101221002803.000|20101221002805.000|TR0|won't you pass this?
20101221002805.000|20101221002808.000|TR0|
20101221002808.000|20101221002810.000|TR0|AVLON:  Yes, and they should pass this.  
20101221002810.000|20101221002812.000|TR0|My former boss, Rudy Giuliani strongly 
20101221002812.000|20101221002814.000|TR0|supports the passage of this bill.  Mayor 
20101221002814.000|20101221002816.000|TR0|Mike Bloomberg, of New York, strongly 
20101221002816.000|20101221002819.000|TR0|supports the passage of this bill.  I 
20101221002819.000|20101221002821.000|TR0|think since its input from Republicans in 
20101221002821.000|20101221002823.000|TR0|the House, particularly Congressman Pete 
20101221002823.000|20101221002825.000|TR0|King, this is a better bill.  Simply, it's 
20101221002825.000|20101221002828.000|TR0|the right thing to do.  You should not 
20101221002828.000|20101221002830.000|TR0|play partisan politics with 9/11.  We need 
20101221002830.000|20101221002832.000|TR0|to be bigger than that.  We need to be 
20101221002832.000|20101221002834.000|TR0|smarter than that.  This should go forward.
20101221002834.000|20101221002836.000|TR0|
20101221002836.000|20101221002839.000|TR0|KING:  Will it go forward?
20101221002839.000|20101221002841.000|TR0|
20101221002841.000|20101221002843.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  Absolutely.  Republicans are 
20101221002843.000|20101221002845.000|TR0|looking like Mr. Potter, here, the cranky 
20101221002845.000|20101221002848.000|TR0|banker in the "It's not such a wonderful 
20101221002848.000|20101221002850.000|TR0|life" movie on this.  They are defending 
20101221002850.000|20101221002852.000|TR0|indefensible ground.  It's like -- they 
20101221002852.000|20101221002854.000|TR0|are telling cancer patients they can't get 
20101221002854.000|20101221002856.000|TR0|what the medicine they need until they 
20101221002856.000|20101221002859.000|TR0|fill out more forms.  So, Republicans have 
20101221002859.000|20101221002901.000|TR0|been snookered on these kind of deals 
20101221002901.000|20101221002903.000|TR0|before though.  That's why they are so 
20101221002903.000|20101221002905.000|TR0|reluctant.
20101221002905.000|20101221002908.000|TR0|
20101221002908.000|20101221002910.000|TR0|Remember, that your talented, President 
20101221002910.000|20101221002912.000|TR0|Clinton, promised all kinds of help to 
20101221002912.000|20101221002914.000|TR0|policemen and firefighters, and it ended 
20101221002914.000|20101221002916.000|TR0|up going to Democratic unions.  
20101221002916.000|20101221002919.000|TR0|Republicans have tried to look at every 
20101221002919.000|20101221002921.000|TR0|detail in this bill to make sure it 
20101221002921.000|20101221002923.000|TR0|actually would go help those that are in 
20101221002923.000|20101221002925.000|TR0|need.  And I think it's gotten better, but 
20101221002925.000|20101221002928.000|TR0|we're just a few moments away from this 
20101221002928.000|20101221002930.000|TR0|becoming law.
20101221002930.000|20101221002932.000|TR0|
20101221002932.000|20101221002934.000|TR0|BEGALA:  I'd say before we give too much 
20101221002934.000|20101221002936.000|TR0|credit to the FOX News Channel, the guy in 
20101221002936.000|20101221002939.000|TR0|the media who was ahead of even the 
20101221002939.000|20101221002941.000|TR0|Democrats was Jon Stewart.  He's going to 
20101221002941.000|20101221002943.000|TR0|throw his shoe at the set if he's 
20101221002943.000|20101221002945.000|TR0|watching, because he hates my guts.  But 
20101221002945.000|20101221002947.000|TR0|he has been a hero on this for those 9/11 
20101221002947.000|20101221002950.000|TR0|responders.  It took a comedy show to take 
20101221002950.000|20101221002952.000|TR0|the political class in Washington and 
20101221002952.000|20101221002954.000|TR0|focus their attention on this.  He should 
20101221002954.000|20101221002956.000|TR0|get a lot of credit.  I think they will 
20101221002956.000|20101221002959.000|TR0|prevail.  I'm glad to see Senator 
20101221002959.000|20101221003001.000|TR0|Gillibrand out there.  I'm thrilled that 
20101221003001.000|20101221003003.000|TR0|Congressman King, a Republican, is taking 
20101221003003.000|20101221003005.000|TR0|a point as well.  But it is indefensible 
20101221003005.000|20101221003007.000|TR0|what Senator Kyl was saying on our air, 
20101221003007.000|20101221003010.000|TR0|earlier.  It is just indefensible.
20101221003010.000|20101221003012.000|TR0|
20101221003012.000|20101221003014.000|TR0|KING:  Let's look at-we thought this-we 
20101221003014.000|20101221003016.000|TR0|weren't sure after the election how 
20101221003016.000|20101221003019.000|TR0|productive the, quote/unquote, lame-duck 
20101221003019.000|20101221003021.000|TR0|session of Congress would be.  We'll had 
20101221003021.000|20101221003023.000|TR0|to do the tax deal.  They wanted to do a 
20101221003023.000|20101221003025.000|TR0|lot more.  They have done "don't ask, 
20101221003025.000|20101221003027.000|TR0|don't tell", the DREAM ACT failed.  We'll 
20101221003027.000|20101221003030.000|TR0|see what happens to 9/11 bill, the START 
20101221003030.000|20101221003032.000|TR0|Treaty, too, we'll see that.  Some other 
20101221003032.000|20101221003034.000|TR0|things have been done.
20101221003034.000|20101221003036.000|TR0|
20101221003036.000|20101221003039.000|TR0|Here's what you look at.  You raised this 
20101221003039.000|20101221003041.000|TR0|point a little bit earlier.  The 
20101221003041.000|20101221003043.000|TR0|president's standing in the polls has 
20101221003043.000|20101221003045.000|TR0|improved a little bit.  He was in a rut 
20101221003045.000|20101221003047.000|TR0|heading in to election.  Here right now, 
20101221003047.000|20101221003050.000|TR0|will Obama's policies move the country in 
20101221003050.000|20101221003052.000|TR0|the right direction?  55 percent say yes; 
20101221003052.000|20101221003054.000|TR0|42 percent say no.  That's a majority.  
20101221003054.000|20101221003056.000|TR0|That's not so bad. Here's the key 
20101221003056.000|20101221003059.000|TR0|question.  The Republicans just won this 
20101221003059.000|20101221003101.000|TR0|huge election. They are going to take over 
20101221003101.000|20101221003103.000|TR0|the House in January; 63 seats they picked 
20101221003103.000|20101221003105.000|TR0|up.  Will Republican policies move the 
20101221003105.000|20101221003107.000|TR0|country in the right direction? 44 percent 
20101221003107.000|20101221003110.000|TR0|of Americans say yes.  51 percent say no.
20101221003110.000|20101221003112.000|TR0|
20101221003112.000|20101221003114.000|TR0|Buyer's remorse already, Alex?
20101221003114.000|20101221003116.000|TR0|
20101221003116.000|20101221003119.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  No, not buyers remorse.  We 
20101221003119.000|20101221003121.000|TR0|didn't compete for leadership.  We just 
20101221003121.000|20101221003123.000|TR0|competed to keep the country safe from 
20101221003123.000|20101221003125.000|TR0|Democratic spending and expansion of 
20101221003125.000|20101221003127.000|TR0|government.  So, again, we're very happy 
20101221003127.000|20101221003130.000|TR0|to just kind of tapping the brakes now and 
20101221003130.000|20101221003132.000|TR0|then, but not leading.  That means the 
20101221003132.000|20101221003134.000|TR0|next year, 2011, both parties will be 
20101221003134.000|20101221003136.000|TR0|searching for the political G-spot.  By G, 
20101221003136.000|20101221003139.000|TR0|of course, I mean growth.
20101221003139.000|20101221003141.000|TR0|
20101221003141.000|20101221003143.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20101221003143.000|20101221003145.000|TR0|
20101221003145.000|20101221003147.000|TR0|Who has the agenda-
20101221003147.000|20101221003150.000|TR0|
20101221003150.000|20101221003152.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20101221003152.000|20101221003154.000|TR0|
20101221003154.000|20101221003156.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's what I thought 
20101221003156.000|20101221003159.000|TR0|you meant.
20101221003159.000|20101221003201.000|TR0|
20101221003201.000|20101221003203.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  Yes, absolutely.  Who has 
20101221003203.000|20101221003205.000|TR0|the agenda to actually take the country to 
20101221003205.000|20101221003207.000|TR0|future and create jobs?  Can you tell me 
20101221003207.000|20101221003210.000|TR0|what the Republican, or Democratic, agenda 
20101221003210.000|20101221003212.000|TR0|strategy for growth is?  Neither side has 
20101221003212.000|20101221003214.000|TR0|made a compelling case.
20101221003214.000|20101221003216.000|TR0|
20101221003216.000|20101221003219.000|TR0|KING:  Can either side, John Avlon, make a 
20101221003219.000|20101221003221.000|TR0|compelling case for growth when the 
20101221003221.000|20101221003223.000|TR0|argument is we can't touch taxes 
20101221003223.000|20101221003225.000|TR0|now-unless the president forces them into 
20101221003225.000|20101221003227.000|TR0|a tax reform debate.  But he has agreed to 
20101221003227.000|20101221003230.000|TR0|keep the Bush tax cuts in place for two 
20101221003230.000|20101221003232.000|TR0|more years.  And what Republicans are 
20101221003232.000|20101221003234.000|TR0|going to say, especially on the House 
20101221003234.000|20101221003236.000|TR0|side, now we're looking for cuts, we are 
20101221003236.000|20101221003238.000|TR0|looking for spending cuts.
20101221003238.000|20101221003241.000|TR0|
20101221003241.000|20101221003243.000|TR0|AVLON:  Yes, and I think that is where a 
20101221003243.000|20101221003245.000|TR0|lot of the debate will be.  It will be 
20101221003245.000|20101221003247.000|TR0|interesting to see if there is a tax 
20101221003247.000|20101221003250.000|TR0|reform debate. That could be pretty 
20101221003250.000|20101221003252.000|TR0|profitable.  But clearly on the tax cut 
20101221003252.000|20101221003254.000|TR0|side that's been a key to the stimulus 
20101221003254.000|20101221003256.000|TR0|growth.  There will be some serious 
20101221003256.000|20101221003258.000|TR0|spending debates that may go under 
20101221003258.000|20101221003301.000|TR0|entitlement reform.  That's necessary to 
20101221003301.000|20101221003303.000|TR0|bring down long term deficit and the debt.
20101221003303.000|20101221003305.000|TR0|
20101221003305.000|20101221003307.000|TR0|But I think those poll numbers show you 
20101221003307.000|20101221003310.000|TR0|something profound about this election and 
20101221003310.000|20101221003312.000|TR0|about the electorate, which is that we 
20101221003312.000|20101221003314.000|TR0|like divided government.  We like the 
20101221003314.000|20101221003316.000|TR0|checks and balances of divided government 
20101221003316.000|20101221003318.000|TR0|and President Obama does very well with 
20101221003318.000|20101221003321.000|TR0|the check and balance of Republican 
20101221003321.000|20101221003323.000|TR0|Congress in place.  It's actually going to 
20101221003323.000|20101221003325.000|TR0|increase confidence in him and his 
20101221003325.000|20101221003327.000|TR0|leadership over the long run.  It's a win- 
20101221003327.000|20101221003330.000|TR0|win, because everybody has to be 
20101221003330.000|20101221003332.000|TR0|responsible here.  You can't just 
20101221003332.000|20101221003334.000|TR0|demagogue stuff and walk away.
20101221003334.000|20101221003336.000|TR0|
20101221003336.000|20101221003338.000|TR0|KING:  Have you seen, Paul, any evidence, 
20101221003338.000|20101221003341.000|TR0|everybody in town is buzzing will he be 
20101221003341.000|20101221003343.000|TR0|Bill Clinton and move to the middle, and 
20101221003343.000|20101221003345.000|TR0|sometimes anger the left, sometimes anger 
20101221003345.000|20101221003347.000|TR0|the right.  Or some people said, no, 
20101221003347.000|20101221003350.000|TR0|please, please, be Harry Truman and raise 
20101221003350.000|20101221003352.000|TR0|holy hell, and fight the Republicans 
20101221003352.000|20101221003354.000|TR0|everyday.  You were right there at Bill 
20101221003354.000|20101221003356.000|TR0|Clinton's side, do you see any signs yet 
20101221003356.000|20101221003358.000|TR0|that tell you, with certainty, which way 
20101221003358.000|20101221003401.000|TR0|he's going?

20101221003403.000|20101221003405.000|TR0|BEGALA:  What he needs to be is FDR.  He 
20101221003405.000|20101221003407.000|TR0|needs be about growth. The word Alex uses 
20101221003407.000|20101221003410.000|TR0|a hilarious metaphor for it, but yes.  We 
20101221003410.000|20101221003412.000|TR0|want to feel good.  We want to feel good 
20101221003412.000|20101221003414.000|TR0|with jobs.  That's the point.  This is why 
20101221003414.000|20101221003416.000|TR0|so many Democrats are so skeptical about 
20101221003416.000|20101221003418.000|TR0|this deal, so few jobs.
20101221003418.000|20101221003421.000|TR0|
20101221003421.000|20101221003423.000|TR0|(CROSS TALK)
20101221003423.000|20101221003425.000|TR0|
20101221003425.000|20101221003427.000|TR0|KING:  Well, how can he do a big growth 
20101221003427.000|20101221003430.000|TR0|plan when it has such tough tight fiscal 
20101221003430.000|20101221003432.000|TR0|situation.
20101221003432.000|20101221003434.000|TR0|
20101221003434.000|20101221003436.000|TR0|BEGALA:  This is the problem.  When you 
20101221003436.000|20101221003438.000|TR0|just spent more money this week than the 
20101221003438.000|20101221003441.000|TR0|bank bailout, more money this week than 
20101221003441.000|20101221003443.000|TR0|the Obama stimulus package, not a lot of 
20101221003443.000|20101221003445.000|TR0|bullets left in the gun.  This is long 
20101221003445.000|20101221003447.000|TR0|term, I think, the big fear that all 
20101221003447.000|20101221003450.000|TR0|Americans should have.  We may not have 
20101221003450.000|20101221003452.000|TR0|enough tools.  We'll are going to have to 
20101221003452.000|20101221003454.000|TR0|need another jobs bill, and I don't know 
20101221003454.000|20101221003456.000|TR0|if we have the political will for it.
20101221003456.000|20101221003458.000|TR0|
20101221003458.000|20101221003501.000|TR0|KING:  I want you guys to look at this.  
20101221003501.000|20101221003503.000|TR0|Normally, especially in politics, it's 
20101221003503.000|20101221003505.000|TR0|like a sport, you want to win.  You don't 
20101221003505.000|20101221003507.000|TR0|want to be fifth out of sixth.  Look at 
20101221003507.000|20101221003510.000|TR0|this list.  This is presidents at the two 
20101221003510.000|20101221003512.000|TR0|year mark.  Our last six president, 
20101221003512.000|20101221003514.000|TR0|George. W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, Bill 
20101221003514.000|20101221003516.000|TR0|Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama, 
20101221003516.000|20101221003518.000|TR0|Ronald Reagan.  Barack Obama is near the 
20101221003518.000|20101221003521.000|TR0|bottom there.  48 percent two years into 
20101221003521.000|20101221003523.000|TR0|his term.  The only guy who did worse, 
20101221003523.000|20101221003525.000|TR0|Ronald Reagan, at 41 percent.  So, you 
20101221003525.000|20101221003527.000|TR0|say, oh, god, that is horrible news for 
20101221003527.000|20101221003529.000|TR0|Barack Obama.  Except, the guy with the 41 
20101221003529.000|20101221003532.000|TR0|went on to win 49 out of 50 states.  So 
20101221003532.000|20101221003534.000|TR0|you look at these numbers, they are 
20101221003534.000|20101221003536.000|TR0|interesting but don't tell you much about 
20101221003536.000|20101221003538.000|TR0|2012, do they?
20101221003538.000|20101221003541.000|TR0|
20101221003541.000|20101221003543.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  Not that much.  But you 
20101221003543.000|20101221003545.000|TR0|can't fall off the floor. That's good news 
20101221003545.000|20101221003547.000|TR0|for Barack Obama.  He's about as low as he 
20101221003547.000|20101221003549.000|TR0|needs to get on this thing.
20101221003549.000|20101221003552.000|TR0|
20101221003552.000|20101221003554.000|TR0|Reagan had an advantage.  He didn't have 
20101221003554.000|20101221003556.000|TR0|to change his narrative. He came in as the 
20101221003556.000|20101221003558.000|TR0|America can do anything you want.  He 
20101221003558.000|20101221003601.000|TR0|stuck with that all through his term.  
20101221003601.000|20101221003603.000|TR0|Barack Obama has gone left.  He has to 
20101221003603.000|20101221003605.000|TR0|pivot back towards the middle.  He has 
20101221003605.000|20101221003607.000|TR0|demonstrated he is more than capable and 
20101221003607.000|20101221003609.000|TR0|willing to do that in the past week.  I 
20101221003609.000|20101221003612.000|TR0|think we'll see a whole lot more of that.
20101221003612.000|20101221003614.000|TR0|
20101221003614.000|20101221003616.000|TR0|KING:  It raises other issues.
20101221003616.000|20101221003618.000|TR0|
20101221003618.000|20101221003621.000|TR0|BEGALA:  Ronald Reagan agreed the largest 
20101221003621.000|20101221003623.000|TR0|tax increase in American history.  That 
20101221003623.000|20101221003625.000|TR0|changed his narrative mightily.  He was 
20101221003625.000|20101221003627.000|TR0|remarkably flexible and he would not 
20101221003627.000|20101221003629.000|TR0|recognize the Republicans today setting 
20101221003629.000|20101221003632.000|TR0|their feet in stone against every single 
20101221003632.000|20101221003634.000|TR0|idea just because a Democrat proposed it.  
20101221003634.000|20101221003636.000|TR0|Reagan was much more flexible than these 
20101221003636.000|20101221003638.000|TR0|guys.
20101221003638.000|20101221003641.000|TR0|
20101221003641.000|20101221003643.000|TR0|But, again, it's not a left-right thing.  
20101221003643.000|20101221003645.000|TR0|It's an up-down thing. Americans are mad 
20101221003645.000|20101221003647.000|TR0|at the elites, and that includes corporate 
20101221003647.000|20101221003649.000|TR0|elites and Wall Street, and of course it 
20101221003649.000|20101221003652.000|TR0|includes government elites like the 
20101221003652.000|20101221003654.000|TR0|president as well.
20101221003654.000|20101221003656.000|TR0|
20101221003656.000|20101221003658.000|TR0|But I think if he can, you know, start to 
20101221003658.000|20101221003701.000|TR0|channel some of our righteous indignation 
20101221003701.000|20101221003703.000|TR0|towards the Wall Street bandits that 
20101221003703.000|20101221003705.000|TR0|ripped this country off and are taking 
20101221003705.000|20101221003707.000|TR0|billions of dollars in bonuses this 
20101221003707.000|20101221003709.000|TR0|holiday season --
20101221003709.000|20101221003712.000|TR0|
20101221003712.000|20101221003714.000|TR0|CASTELLANOS:  Especially the ones running 
20101221003714.000|20101221003716.000|TR0|the Obama administration.
20101221003716.000|20101221003718.000|TR0|
20101221003718.000|20101221003721.000|TR0|KING:  John Paul, Alex, thanks for coming 
20101221003721.000|20101221003723.000|TR0|in.  We'll continue the conversation.
20101221003723.000|20101221003725.000|TR0|
20101221003725.000|20101221003727.000|TR0|When we come back, we'll explore a 
20101221003727.000|20101221003729.000|TR0|pressing question.  The president on 
20101221003729.000|20101221003732.000|TR0|Wednesday morning will sign the repeal of 
20101221003732.000|20101221003734.000|TR0|don't-ask, don't-tell.  What we don't know 
20101221003734.000|20101221003736.000|TR0|yet is how long the Pentagon will take to 
20101221003736.000|20101221003738.000|TR0|say it's OK to serve openly.  We'll debate 
20101221003738.000|20101221003741.000|TR0|that, just ahead.
20101221003741.000|20101221003743.000|TR0|
20101221003743.000|20101221003745.000|TR0|And also we'll take a closer look at this 
20101221003745.000|20101221003747.000|TR0|tax cut debate.  Now what?  Will it cause 
20101221003747.000|20101221003749.000|TR0|growth?  Will it help the president 
20101221003749.000|20101221003752.000|TR0|politically? Will it run up the deficit?  
20101221003752.000|20101221003754.000|TR0|We have a great debate segment on that.
20101221003754.000|20101221003756.000|TR0|
20101221003756.000|20101221003758.000|TR0|And beat on the street tonight, he says he 
20101221003758.000|20101221003800.000|TR0|wants to ask some questions of me.  I call 
20101221003800.000|20101221003803.000|TR0|it "Stump the Anchor."
20101221003803.000|20101221003805.000|TR0|
20101221003805.000|20101221003807.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20101221003807.000|20101221003809.000|TR0|
20101221003809.000|20101221003812.000|TR0|KING:  The White House tonight says the 
20101221003812.000|20101221003814.000|TR0|signing ceremony for the legislation 
20101221003814.000|20101221003816.000|TR0|repealing the "don't ask, don't tell" 
20101221003816.000|20101221003818.000|TR0|policy prohibiting gays from serving 
20101221003818.000|20101221003820.000|TR0|opening in the military will be this 
20101221003820.000|20101221003823.000|TR0|Wednesday, but it could be months before 
20101221003823.000|20101221003825.000|TR0|the historic change takes effect.  Defense 
20101221003825.000|20101221003827.000|TR0|Secretary Robert Gates say he will, quote, 
20101221003827.000|20101221003829.000|TR0|"approach this process deliberately."
20101221003829.000|20101221003832.000|TR0|
20101221003832.000|20101221003834.000|TR0|So how long should it take?  Alex 
20101221003834.000|20101221003836.000|TR0|Nicholson served in the army intelligence 
20101221003836.000|20101221003838.000|TR0|against until he was discharged in 2002 
20101221003838.000|20101221003840.000|TR0|under the "don't ask, don't tell" rule.  
20101221003840.000|20101221003843.000|TR0|And Peter Sprigg is the senior fellow for 
20101221003843.000|20101221003845.000|TR0|policy studies at the Conservative Family 
20101221003845.000|20101221003847.000|TR0|Research Council which opposed the repeal.
20101221003847.000|20101221003849.000|TR0|
20101221003849.000|20101221003852.000|TR0|Alex, as you talk about how long do you 
20101221003852.000|20101221003854.000|TR0|think the Pentagon deserves to implement 
20101221003854.000|20101221003856.000|TR0|the transition, also factor in these 
20101221003856.000|20101221003858.000|TR0|numbers. The Pentagon did this big survey. 
20101221003858.000|20101221003900.000|TR0| It's the reason they swayed some votes in 
20101221003900.000|20101221003903.000|TR0|the end.  Overall, 30 percent of people in 
20101221003903.000|20101221003905.000|TR0|the military said there would be a 
20101221003905.000|20101221003907.000|TR0|negative or very negative reaction.  You 
20101221003907.000|20101221003909.000|TR0|ask combat unit, 48 percent said it would 
20101221003909.000|20101221003912.000|TR0|be negative or very negative, 58 percent 
20101221003912.000|20101221003914.000|TR0|of marine combat units negative or very 
20101221003914.000|20101221003916.000|TR0|negative.
20101221003916.000|20101221003918.000|TR0|
20101221003918.000|20101221003920.000|TR0|Should there be some distinction when you 
20101221003920.000|20101221003923.000|TR0|repeal the policy and gays can serve 
20101221003923.000|20101221003925.000|TR0|openly?  Should it be different or does it 
20101221003925.000|20101221003927.000|TR0|have to be across the board the same?
20101221003927.000|20101221003929.000|TR0|
20101221003929.000|20101221003932.000|TR0|ALEX NICHOLSON, FORMER ARMY INTELLIGENCE 
20101221003932.000|20101221003934.000|TR0|COLLECTOR:  I think that's a really good 
20101221003934.000|20101221003936.000|TR0|question.  The Pentagon has been studying 
20101221003936.000|20101221003938.000|TR0|this issue for more than 50 years and this 
20101221003938.000|20101221003940.000|TR0|latest iteration they had over nine months 
20101221003940.000|20101221003943.000|TR0|to do a very thorough and comprehensive 
20101221003943.000|20101221003945.000|TR0|report on how to go about implementing the 
20101221003945.000|20101221003947.000|TR0|repeal of "don't-ask, don't-tell."  They 
20101221003947.000|20101221003949.000|TR0|may take a couple of months.  We don't 
20101221003949.000|20101221003952.000|TR0|know.
20101221003952.000|20101221003954.000|TR0|
20101221003954.000|20101221003956.000|TR0|KING:  How long do you think is the bottom 
20101221003956.000|20101221003958.000|TR0|line for you?  If it's three months it's 
20101221003958.000|20101221004000.000|TR0|OK, but six months do you start to 
20101221004000.000|20101221004003.000|TR0|question?
20101221004003.000|20101221004005.000|TR0|
20101221004005.000|20101221004007.000|TR0|NICHOLSON:  I think about the first 
20101221004007.000|20101221004009.000|TR0|quarter of 2011 is about as long as I 
20101221004009.000|20101221004012.000|TR0|think they reasonably need.  They have 
20101221004012.000|20101221004014.000|TR0|already done studies on this thing for 50 
20101221004014.000|20101221004016.000|TR0|years.  They had nine months to prepare.  
20101221004016.000|20101221004018.000|TR0|We already have gays serving openly right 
20101221004018.000|20101221004020.000|TR0|now, defying the law.  About three months 
20101221004020.000|20101221004023.000|TR0|is all they really need, realistically.
20101221004023.000|20101221004025.000|TR0|
20101221004025.000|20101221004027.000|TR0|KING:  And Peter, Tony Perkins, who runs 
20101221004027.000|20101221004029.000|TR0|your organization, issued a statement 
20101221004029.000|20101221004032.000|TR0|tonight, and I want to ask you about it.  
20101221004032.000|20101221004034.000|TR0|We have disagreements in this town, and 
20101221004034.000|20101221004036.000|TR0|some are legitimate policy conversations, 
20101221004036.000|20101221004038.000|TR0|some of them are more political arguments.
20101221004038.000|20101221004040.000|TR0|
20101221004040.000|20101221004043.000|TR0|But Tony Perkins makes this statement.  
20101221004043.000|20101221004045.000|TR0|"The Senate repealed "don't-ask, 
20101221004045.000|20101221004047.000|TR0|don't-tell" because it endears them to the 
20101221004047.000|20101221004049.000|TR0|greatest sources of campaign dollars in 
20101221004049.000|20101221004051.000|TR0|America, the homosexual lobby.  As that 
20101221004051.000|20101221004054.000|TR0|lobby stands triumphantly on the rubble of 
20101221004054.000|20101221004056.000|TR0|"don't ask don't tell," they will tell you 
20101221004056.000|20101221004058.000|TR0|that they can already see marriage in the 
20101221004058.000|20101221004100.000|TR0|distance."
20101221004100.000|20101221004103.000|TR0|
20101221004103.000|20101221004105.000|TR0|PETER SPRIGG, OPPOSES REPEAL OF "DON'T 
20101221004105.000|20101221004107.000|TR0|ASK, DON'T TELL":  I think that that's a 
20101221004107.000|20101221004109.000|TR0|part of the reason why Nancy Pelosi and 
20101221004109.000|20101221004111.000|TR0|Harry Reid made this a top priority during 
20101221004111.000|20101221004114.000|TR0|the lame duck session.  It's astonishing 
20101221004114.000|20101221004116.000|TR0|to me that with so many other things they 
20101221004116.000|20101221004118.000|TR0|had to deal with, with funding the 
20101221004118.000|20101221004120.000|TR0|government, with preventing a massive tax 
20101221004120.000|20101221004123.000|TR0|increase on January 1st, dealing with a 
20101221004123.000|20101221004125.000|TR0|major arms limitation treaty, that they 
20101221004125.000|20101221004127.000|TR0|would even give any attention in a lame 
20101221004127.000|20101221004129.000|TR0|duck session.
20101221004129.000|20101221004131.000|TR0|
20101221004131.000|20101221004134.000|TR0|KING:  They managed to do all that and 
20101221004134.000|20101221004136.000|TR0|still address this issue.
20101221004136.000|20101221004138.000|TR0|
20101221004138.000|20101221004140.000|TR0|SPRIGG:  They have.  It's sort of 
20101221004140.000|20101221004143.000|TR0|shameless to push through a large liberal 
20101221004143.000|20101221004145.000|TR0|agenda before they lose the reins of power.
20101221004145.000|20101221004147.000|TR0|
20101221004147.000|20101221004149.000|TR0|KING:  Do you honestly see the same sex 
20101221004149.000|20101221004151.000|TR0|marriage debate now coming next, or I 
20101221004151.000|20101221004154.000|TR0|could cynically ask, is your organization 
20101221004154.000|20101221004156.000|TR0|raising the prospect of that so it can 
20101221004156.000|20101221004158.000|TR0|raise money?
20101221004158.000|20101221004200.000|TR0|
20101221004200.000|20101221004203.000|TR0|SPRIGG:  I've seen quotations already in 
20101221004203.000|20101221004205.000|TR0|the media and have been asked about it by 
20101221004205.000|20101221004207.000|TR0|other reporters about the homosexual 
20101221004207.000|20101221004209.000|TR0|movement seeing marriage as the next 
20101221004209.000|20101221004211.000|TR0|frontier and this as giving momentum to 
20101221004211.000|20101221004214.000|TR0|the legalization of same sex marriage.
20101221004214.000|20101221004216.000|TR0|
20101221004216.000|20101221004218.000|TR0|I think the same sex marriage issue is 
20101221004218.000|20101221004220.000|TR0|very different from this issue.  This was 
20101221004220.000|20101221004223.000|TR0|an issue in which you had homosexuals as 
20101221004223.000|20101221004225.000|TR0|individuals being excluded from 
20101221004225.000|20101221004227.000|TR0|participating in the military for, we 
20101221004227.000|20101221004229.000|TR0|believe, valid reasons.  But nevertheless 
20101221004229.000|20101221004231.000|TR0|it was directed at individuals.       The 
20101221004231.000|20101221004234.000|TR0|marriage issue is about granting special 
20101221004234.000|20101221004236.000|TR0|benefits, special affirmation to same sex 
20101221004236.000|20101221004238.000|TR0|couples, to homosexual relationships.  I 
20101221004238.000|20101221004240.000|TR0|think that's a very different kind of 
20101221004240.000|20101221004243.000|TR0|issue.
20101221004243.000|20101221004245.000|TR0|
20101221004245.000|20101221004247.000|TR0|KING:  Alex, are there any factors from 
20101221004247.000|20101221004249.000|TR0|your servers, if the Pentagon does this, I 
20101221004249.000|20101221004251.000|TR0|may not like it but I understand.  If 
20101221004251.000|20101221004254.000|TR0|there's any kind of segregation or 
20101221004254.000|20101221004256.000|TR0|opt-out, or does it have to be for it to 
20101221004256.000|20101221004258.000|TR0|work universally across the board, like 
20101221004258.000|20101221004300.000|TR0|when racial integration happened in the 
20101221004300.000|20101221004303.000|TR0|army?
20101221004303.000|20101221004305.000|TR0|
20101221004305.000|20101221004307.000|TR0|NICHOLSON:  I think the best thing the 
20101221004307.000|20101221004309.000|TR0|Pentagon could do is to do it across the 
20101221004309.000|20101221004311.000|TR0|board and do it swiftly and quickly.  I 
20101221004311.000|20101221004314.000|TR0|think the senior military leadership, the 
20101221004314.000|20101221004316.000|TR0|commandant of the Marine Corps said if 
20101221004316.000|20101221004318.000|TR0|you're going to do it, do it quickly and 
20101221004318.000|20101221004320.000|TR0|swiftly.  They certainly would be shooting 
20101221004320.000|20101221004322.000|TR0|themselves in the foot the more they drag 
20101221004322.000|20101221004325.000|TR0|it out.
20101221004325.000|20101221004327.000|TR0|
20101221004327.000|20101221004329.000|TR0|KING:  And again back to Tony Perkins 
20101221004329.000|20101221004331.000|TR0|statement.  He goes on the list "12 
20101221004331.000|20101221004334.000|TR0|percent of the military surveyed 
20101221004334.000|20101221004336.000|TR0|threatened to leave the service."  Then he 
20101221004336.000|20101221004338.000|TR0|lists all the Republicans that voted for 
20101221004338.000|20101221004340.000|TR0|this.
20101221004340.000|20101221004342.000|TR0|
20101221004342.000|20101221004345.000|TR0|Then he says at the end, "Are they 
20101221004345.000|20101221004347.000|TR0|prepared to accept to accept the 
20101221004347.000|20101221004349.000|TR0|responsibility for losing those 264,600 
20101221004349.000|20101221004351.000|TR0|soldiers," meaning if they leave the 
20101221004351.000|20101221004354.000|TR0|military.  He goes on the say this, "and 
20101221004354.000|20101221004356.000|TR0|others who may be injured or killed 
20101221004356.000|20101221004358.000|TR0|because of their votes?"  Injured or 
20101221004358.000|20101221004400.000|TR0|killed because gays will be allowed to 
20101221004400.000|20101221004402.000|TR0|serve openly in the military?  It's 
20101221004402.000|20101221004405.000|TR0|controversial.  It will be tough for some 
20101221004405.000|20101221004407.000|TR0|people.  All social change is.  You thinks 
20101221004407.000|20101221004409.000|TR0|it's wrong, he think it's right.  But 
20101221004409.000|20101221004411.000|TR0|injured or killed?
20101221004411.000|20101221004414.000|TR0|
20101221004414.000|20101221004416.000|TR0|SPRIGG:  That was an issue not raised 
20101221004416.000|20101221004418.000|TR0|first by us, but raised by General Amos, 
20101221004418.000|20101221004420.000|TR0|the commandant of the Marine Corps who 
20101221004420.000|20101221004422.000|TR0|just last week said that he believed that 
20101221004422.000|20101221004425.000|TR0|with this distraction it could result in 
20101221004425.000|20101221004427.000|TR0|increased casualties.
20101221004427.000|20101221004429.000|TR0|
20101221004429.000|20101221004431.000|TR0|A specific example of that was raised in 
20101221004431.000|20101221004434.000|TR0|Congressional testimony earlier in the 
20101221004434.000|20101221004436.000|TR0|year by General John Sheehan, who 
20101221004436.000|20101221004438.000|TR0|testified to a specific incident when he 
20101221004438.000|20101221004440.000|TR0|was in Vietnam when some soldiers on the 
20101221004440.000|20101221004442.000|TR0|frontline, there was one who attempted to 
20101221004442.000|20101221004445.000|TR0|molest the other.
20101221004445.000|20101221004447.000|TR0|
20101221004447.000|20101221004449.000|TR0|KING:  That was 40 some years ago.  I hope 
20101221004449.000|20101221004451.000|TR0|people understood -- I don't mean to take 
20101221004451.000|20101221004454.000|TR0|side in debates.  I hope people understand 
20101221004454.000|20101221004456.000|TR0|this --
20101221004456.000|20101221004458.000|TR0|
20101221004458.000|20101221004500.000|TR0|SPRIGG:  This is sexual assault.
20101221004500.000|20101221004502.000|TR0|
20101221004502.000|20101221004505.000|TR0|KING:  You think it's possible anybody 
20101221004505.000|20101221004507.000|TR0|would be injured or killed because of this?
20101221004507.000|20101221004509.000|TR0|
20101221004509.000|20101221004511.000|TR0|NICHOLSON:  I really don't think so.  I 
20101221004511.000|20101221004514.000|TR0|think that's proven by the fact that you 
20101221004514.000|20101221004516.000|TR0|already have gay women and men serving 
20101221004516.000|20101221004518.000|TR0|openly in the military today.  You have 
20101221004518.000|20101221004520.000|TR0|many, many hundreds defying the law,

20101221004525.000|20101221004527.000|TR0|discharges for 40, 45, 50 days.  Nobody

20101221004736.000|20101221004738.000|TR0|economists and political strategists are 
20101221004738.000|20101221004740.000|TR0|asking now that the president has signed 
20101221004740.000|20101221004742.000|TR0|the big tax compromise.  There's a big 
20101221004742.000|20101221004745.000|TR0|debate about both whether it will help the 
20101221004745.000|20101221004747.000|TR0|economy and whether it will help the 
20101221004747.000|20101221004749.000|TR0|president's reelection prospects.

20101221004751.000|20101221004753.000|TR0|Let's talk it over with Robert Kuttner, 
20101221004753.000|20101221004756.000|TR0|the cofounder and co- editor of the 
20101221004756.000|20101221004758.000|TR0|liberal "American Prospect" and Grover

20101221004800.000|20101221004802.000|TR0|Americans for Tax Reform.  Bob Kuttner, 
20101221004802.000|20101221004805.000|TR0|you don't like this deal.  I want to read 
20101221004805.000|20101221004807.000|TR0|something you wrote about it.  You say 
20101221004807.000|20101221004809.000|TR0|this, "This tax deal rebranded as a 
20101221004809.000|20101221004811.000|TR0|stimulus program is paltry and ineffective 
20101221004811.000|20101221004813.000|TR0|as an economic tonic.
20101221004813.000|20101221004816.000|TR0|
20101221004816.000|20101221004818.000|TR0|What anyone hardly seems to have grasped 
20101221004818.000|20101221004820.000|TR0|is that the deal basically continues the 
20101221004820.000|20101221004822.000|TR0|status quo with almost no stimulus.  If 
20101221004822.000|20101221004825.000|TR0|the tax rates on the books in 2010 did not 
20101221004825.000|20101221004827.000|TR0|produce recovery why should we expect the 
20101221004827.000|20101221004829.000|TR0|very same will change the economy in 2011?"
20101221004829.000|20101221004831.000|TR0|
20101221004831.000|20101221004833.000|TR0|So you think the president sold out for 
20101221004833.000|20101221004836.000|TR0|nothing?
20101221004836.000|20101221004838.000|TR0|

20101221004840.000|20101221004842.000|TR0|PROSPECT":  Leave out the politics for a 
20101221004842.000|20101221004844.000|TR0|minute.  Let's just talk about the 
20101221004844.000|20101221004847.000|TR0|economics. You're taking the tax rates 
20101221004847.000|20101221004849.000|TR0|that were in effect in 2010, which was a 
20101221004849.000|20101221004851.000|TR0|terrible year economically. and saying 
20101221004851.000|20101221004853.000|TR0|we'll continue them in 2011, 2012.  That's 
20101221004853.000|20101221004856.000|TR0|not a stimulus.
20101221004856.000|20101221004858.000|TR0|
20101221004858.000|20101221004900.000|TR0|You're taking the unemployment 
20101221004900.000|20101221004902.000|TR0|compensation system that was in effect 
20101221004902.000|20101221004904.000|TR0|last year and the Republicans are going to 
20101221004904.000|20101221004907.000|TR0|say, well, we'll compromise we'll continue 
20101221004907.000|20101221004909.000|TR0|them next year.  Same status quo -- no 
20101221004909.000|20101221004911.000|TR0|stimulus.
20101221004911.000|20101221004913.000|TR0|
20101221004913.000|20101221004916.000|TR0|You're taking a slight cut in the payroll 
20101221004916.000|20101221004918.000|TR0|tax which substitutes for a different tax. 
20101221004918.000|20101221004920.000|TR0| The only stimulus in the bill is about 
20101221004920.000|20101221004922.000|TR0|$50 billion or $60 billion worth of 
20101221004922.000|20101221004924.000|TR0|business tax cuts in a $15 trillion 
20101221004924.000|20101221004927.000|TR0|economy, so I don't think it works as 
20101221004927.000|20101221004929.000|TR0|economics.

20101221004931.000|20101221004933.000|TR0|KING:  Are you as down beat about the 
20101221004933.000|20101221004936.000|TR0|economic prospects or do you subscribe 
20101221004936.000|20101221004938.000|TR0|there's not complete certainty because 
20101221004938.000|20101221004940.000|TR0|it's only a two year extension, but 
20101221004940.000|20101221004942.000|TR0|there's a bit more certainty, therefore 
20101221004942.000|20101221004944.000|TR0|there will be more investment?
20101221004944.000|20101221004947.000|TR0|
20101221004947.000|20101221004949.000|TR0|GROVER NORQUIST, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: 
20101221004949.000|20101221004951.000|TR0| Go back two years, investors were looking 
20101221004951.000|20101221004953.000|TR0|at a significant increase in the capital 
20101221004953.000|20101221004956.000|TR0|gains tax, the dividend tax, top rate 
20101221004956.000|20101221004958.000|TR0|marginal tax rate, now, in January, if it 
20101221004958.000|20101221005000.000|TR0|wasn't continued.  So one of the reasons 
20101221005000.000|20101221005002.000|TR0|why the economy has been slower than it 
20101221005002.000|20101221005004.000|TR0|should have been was this threatened tax 
20101221005004.000|20101221005007.000|TR0|increase.
20101221005007.000|20101221005009.000|TR0|
20101221005009.000|20101221005011.000|TR0|The problem for Obama is he didn't want to 
20101221005011.000|20101221005013.000|TR0|make it permanent.  He only wanted to 
20101221005013.000|20101221005016.000|TR0|extend it for two years.  Some won't get 
20101221005016.000|20101221005018.000|TR0|all the economic benefits of permanently 
20101221005018.000|20101221005020.000|TR0|reducing the capital gains tax, 
20101221005020.000|20101221005022.000|TR0|permanently reducing marginal tax rates.
20101221005022.000|20101221005024.000|TR0|
20101221005024.000|20101221005027.000|TR0|He gave us the lower rates so when we 
20101221005027.000|20101221005029.000|TR0|replace him as president we'll have lower 
20101221005029.000|20101221005031.000|TR0|rates to start from.  But he didn't do it 
20101221005031.000|20101221005033.000|TR0|in a way that's going to help him with the 
20101221005033.000|20101221005036.000|TR0|economy.
20101221005036.000|20101221005038.000|TR0|
20101221005038.000|20101221005040.000|TR0|KING:  And you make the point when you 
20101221005040.000|20101221005042.000|TR0|replace him as president. There are a lot 
20101221005042.000|20101221005044.000|TR0|of people on your side who think this tax 
20101221005044.000|20101221005047.000|TR0|deal helps the president.  I want to show 
20101221005047.000|20101221005049.000|TR0|some statistics and go to an economist at 
20101221005049.000|20101221005051.000|TR0|Yale University who does these things by 
20101221005051.000|20101221005053.000|TR0|the numbers.
20101221005053.000|20101221005056.000|TR0|
20101221005056.000|20101221005058.000|TR0|Let me first set up the economy.  Here's 
20101221005058.000|20101221005100.000|TR0|where we are -- 9.8 percent unemployment.  
20101221005100.000|20101221005102.000|TR0|Here is where the election is in 2012.  Of 
20101221005102.000|20101221005104.000|TR0|course the president of the United States 
20101221005104.000|20101221005107.000|TR0|is hoping this number goes down somewhere 
20101221005107.000|20101221005109.000|TR0|like that.  A lot of people think it's 
20101221005109.000|20101221005111.000|TR0|going to essentially do something like 
20101221005111.000|20101221005113.000|TR0|that over the next couple years.  That's 
20101221005113.000|20101221005116.000|TR0|the big political economic question over 
20101221005116.000|20101221005118.000|TR0|the next two years.
20101221005118.000|20101221005120.000|TR0|
20101221005120.000|20101221005122.000|TR0|Let's turn that one off and look at GDP.  
20101221005122.000|20101221005124.000|TR0|Take the unemployment away and look at 
20101221005124.000|20101221005127.000|TR0|GDP.  This is where we are.  We started to 
20101221005127.000|20101221005129.000|TR0|come out of the recession here, got up 
20101221005129.000|20101221005131.000|TR0|here and it's relatively anemic growth 
20101221005131.000|20101221005133.000|TR0|down in here since.  Again, the question 
20101221005133.000|20101221005135.000|TR0|is what happens between now and the 
20101221005135.000|20101221005138.000|TR0|election?  If the president can get above 
20101221005138.000|20101221005140.000|TR0|this line above three percent most people 
20101221005140.000|20101221005142.000|TR0|think he'll be in pretty good shape.
20101221005142.000|20101221005144.000|TR0|
20101221005144.000|20101221005147.000|TR0|Why?  Let's look at this model.  This is 
20101221005147.000|20101221005149.000|TR0|again from Ray Fare at Yale University.  
20101221005149.000|20101221005151.000|TR0|Essentially, how many good quarters do you 
20101221005151.000|20101221005153.000|TR0|have? What is the rate of growth?  Right 
20101221005153.000|20101221005155.000|TR0|now if we stay somewhere like this 
20101221005155.000|20101221005158.000|TR0|bouncing along at an anemic rate of 
20101221005158.000|20101221005200.000|TR0|growth, then you don't have very many 
20101221005200.000|20101221005202.000|TR0|strong quarters.  And you calculate what 
20101221005202.000|20101221005204.000|TR0|happens to the president?  51 percent, 
20101221005204.000|20101221005207.000|TR0|which means there is a margin of error, a 
20101221005207.000|20101221005209.000|TR0|very competitive presidential election in 
20101221005209.000|20101221005211.000|TR0|a two way race somewhere around 50/50.
20101221005211.000|20101221005213.000|TR0|
20101221005213.000|20101221005215.000|TR0|If you had a double dip recession, which 
20101221005215.000|20101221005218.000|TR0|some warn might happen, the White House 
20101221005218.000|20101221005220.000|TR0|used that argument, then you're in 
20101221005220.000|20101221005222.000|TR0|negative territory for growth.  You don't 
20101221005222.000|20101221005224.000|TR0|have that many strong quarters and then 
20101221005224.000|20101221005227.000|TR0|you calculate that one out. and the 
20101221005227.000|20101221005229.000|TR0|president falls below 50 percent then you 
20101221005229.000|20101221005231.000|TR0|would look for the Republicans.
20101221005231.000|20101221005233.000|TR0|
20101221005233.000|20101221005235.000|TR0|Here's what a lot of people think when 
20101221005235.000|20101221005238.000|TR0|they look at this. Charles Krauthammer, 
20101221005238.000|20101221005240.000|TR0|for example, Grover, he thinks this will 
20101221005240.000|20101221005242.000|TR0|gin up growth a little bit.  If the 
20101221005242.000|20101221005244.000|TR0|president gets above three percent growth 
20101221005244.000|20101221005247.000|TR0|heading into 2012 you've had more strong 
20101221005247.000|20101221005249.000|TR0|quarters, and if you calculate that you 
20101221005249.000|20101221005251.000|TR0|see a president up above 55 percent.
20101221005251.000|20101221005253.000|TR0|
20101221005253.000|20101221005255.000|TR0|Now, this model has worked.  It's based on 
20101221005255.000|20101221005258.000|TR0|economic numbers and not so much political 
20101221005258.000|20101221005300.000|TR0|factors but it has worked pretty well over 
20101221005300.000|20101221005302.000|TR0|the last 30 years or so.  Do you worry 
20101221005302.000|20101221005304.000|TR0|that the best you can get right now, that 
20101221005304.000|20101221005307.000|TR0|you help a Democratic president?
20101221005307.000|20101221005309.000|TR0|
20101221005309.000|20101221005311.000|TR0|NORQUIST:  The goal of reducing tax rates 
20101221005311.000|20101221005313.000|TR0|and reining in spending is not to win the 
20101221005313.000|20101221005315.000|TR0|next election but to have a better economy 
20101221005315.000|20101221005318.000|TR0|and create more jobs for the American 
20101221005318.000|20101221005320.000|TR0|people.  I tend to think given that Obama 
20101221005320.000|20101221005322.000|TR0|was taking us off a cliff on spending, a 
20101221005322.000|20101221005324.000|TR0|Republican house and more Republican 
20101221005324.000|20101221005327.000|TR0|Senate are going to pull him back, that 
20101221005327.000|20101221005329.000|TR0|the American people will realize that's 
20101221005329.000|20101221005331.000|TR0|why the economy will be getting stronger, 
20101221005331.000|20101221005333.000|TR0|not because of what Obama is doing.
20101221005333.000|20101221005335.000|TR0|
20101221005335.000|20101221005338.000|TR0|KING:  But that is the question.  What did 
20101221005338.000|20101221005340.000|TR0|we learn about Obama here?  Did we learn 
20101221005340.000|20101221005342.000|TR0|anything lasting here?  I know you're 
20101221005342.000|20101221005344.000|TR0|worried to a degree.  I want to read you a 
20101221005344.000|20101221005347.000|TR0|little bit from the "Wall Street Journal" 
20101221005347.000|20101221005349.000|TR0|editorial over the weekend.  "A Democratic 
20101221005349.000|20101221005351.000|TR0|Congress extended the Bush era tax rates, 
20101221005351.000|20101221005353.000|TR0|Republican senators disavowed earmarks to 
20101221005353.000|20101221005355.000|TR0|kill a spending as usual bill, and a 
20101221005355.000|20101221005358.000|TR0|federal court declared Obama care to be 
20101221005358.000|20101221005400.000|TR0|unconstitutional.
20101221005400.000|20101221005402.000|TR0|
20101221005402.000|20101221005404.000|TR0|The arc of these events reveals a break 
20101221005404.000|20101221005406.000|TR0|from the helter-skelter government 
20101221005406.000|20101221005409.000|TR0|expansion of the past four years."  Do you 
20101221005409.000|20101221005411.000|TR0|see that, a dramatic shift in our politics?
20101221005411.000|20101221005413.000|TR0|
20101221005413.000|20101221005415.000|TR0|KUTTNER:  Well, I see spending cuts 
20101221005415.000|20101221005418.000|TR0|because what the Republicans have done 
20101221005418.000|20101221005420.000|TR0|with this tax deal is they've teed up the 
20101221005420.000|20101221005422.000|TR0|next round of spending cuts.
20101221005422.000|20101221005424.000|TR0|
20101221005424.000|20101221005426.000|TR0|Where Grover and I disagree is I think if 
20101221005426.000|20101221005429.000|TR0|you cut spending in the teeth of a 
20101221005429.000|20101221005431.000|TR0|recession you're only going to slow down 
20101221005431.000|20101221005433.000|TR0|growth.  So I think Professor Fare has a 
20101221005433.000|20101221005435.000|TR0|very good model, but the problem with the 
20101221005435.000|20101221005438.000|TR0|model is when you have very high 
20101221005438.000|20101221005440.000|TR0|unemployment, even if you have a couple of 
20101221005440.000|20101221005442.000|TR0|quarters of good growth, in places like 
20101221005442.000|20101221005444.000|TR0|Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, 
20101221005444.000|20101221005446.000|TR0|Minnesota that Obama has to win, even if 
20101221005446.000|20101221005449.000|TR0|the national rate comes down a little bit, 
20101221005449.000|20101221005451.000|TR0|if unemployment is high in those states, 
20101221005451.000|20101221005453.000|TR0|those are the states where the Democrats 
20101221005453.000|20101221005455.000|TR0|got wiped out this summer.
20101221005455.000|20101221005458.000|TR0|
20101221005458.000|20101221005500.000|TR0|KING:  What should he have done?
20101221005500.000|20101221005502.000|TR0|
20101221005502.000|20101221005504.000|TR0|KUTTNER:  He should have held out for a 
20101221005504.000|20101221005506.000|TR0|better deal.  He should have done jobs, 
20101221005506.000|20101221005509.000|TR0|jobs, jobs, rebuild the middle class in 
20101221005509.000|20101221005511.000|TR0|this country, make things in America 
20101221005511.000|20101221005513.000|TR0|again.  And he should have been more of a 
20101221005513.000|20101221005515.000|TR0|fighter, and then even if the Republicans 
20101221005515.000|20101221005518.000|TR0|blocked it they would have taken the blame 
20101221005518.000|20101221005520.000|TR0|for blocking it.
20101221005520.000|20101221005522.000|TR0|
20101221005522.000|20101221005524.000|TR0|NORQUIST:  Look, Obama is a left of center 
20101221005524.000|20101221005526.000|TR0|democrat.  He spends money when he has the 
20101221005526.000|20101221005529.000|TR0|opportunity.  The modern Republican Party 
20101221005529.000|20101221005531.000|TR0|under Bush spent less than Obama but more 
20101221005531.000|20101221005533.000|TR0|than it should have.
20101221005533.000|20101221005535.000|TR0|
20101221005535.000|20101221005538.000|TR0|And with the Tea Party movement coming in 
20101221005538.000|20101221005540.000|TR0|over the last two years they infused a 
20101221005540.000|20101221005542.000|TR0|back bone in the Republican Party which is 
20101221005542.000|20101221005544.000|TR0|continued after the election.  It wasn't 
20101221005544.000|20101221005546.000|TR0|just something that was helpful in 2010.
20101221005546.000|20101221005549.000|TR0|
20101221005549.000|20101221005551.000|TR0|And what we're seeing is the Republicans 
20101221005551.000|20101221005553.000|TR0|swearing off earmarks, defeating the $1 
20101221005553.000|20101221005555.000|TR0|trillion spending spree that the Democrats 
20101221005555.000|20101221005558.000|TR0|wanted as their Parthian shot out of town.
20101221005558.000|20101221005600.000|TR0|
20101221005600.000|20101221005602.000|TR0|KING:  You'll still have a Democratic 
20101221005602.000|20101221005604.000|TR0|president and a narrowly Democratic 
20101221005604.000|20101221005606.000|TR0|senate.  Can you get real deficit 
20101221005606.000|20101221005609.000|TR0|reduction if that's your goal now that 
20101221005609.000|20101221005611.000|TR0|you've extended these tax cuts, less money 
20101221005611.000|20101221005613.000|TR0|coming in to Washington, can you get real 
20101221005613.000|20101221005615.000|TR0|deficit reduction if that's your goal, and 
20101221005615.000|20101221005618.000|TR0|maybe it's not, without at least saying as 
20101221005618.000|20101221005620.000|TR0|long as you have a Democratic president 
20101221005620.000|20101221005622.000|TR0|and a Democratic Senate maybe you have to 
20101221005622.000|20101221005624.000|TR0|agree to some revenue increase as part of 
20101221005624.000|20101221005626.000|TR0|the equation.
20101221005626.000|20101221005629.000|TR0|
20101221005629.000|20101221005631.000|TR0|NORQUIST:  No, the Republicans will not 
20101221005631.000|20101221005633.000|TR0|agree to a tax increase. What they will do 
20101221005633.000|20101221005635.000|TR0|is take the domestic discretionary 
20101221005635.000|20101221005638.000|TR0|spending and some of the military 
20101221005638.000|20101221005640.000|TR0|discretionary spending that's been jumped 
20101221005640.000|20101221005642.000|TR0|up under Obama.  We need to take that back 
20101221005642.000|20101221005644.000|TR0|down to 2007-2008 levels.  And that can be 
20101221005644.000|20101221005646.000|TR0|done without a super majority in the House 
20101221005646.000|20101221005649.000|TR0|or the Senate, just with the U.S. House of 
20101221005649.000|20101221005651.000|TR0|Representatives saying no to higher tax 
20101221005651.000|20101221005653.000|TR0|increases.
20101221005653.000|20101221005655.000|TR0|
20101221005655.000|20101221005657.000|TR0|KING:  And if that's the choice what 
20101221005657.000|20101221005700.000|TR0|should the Democratic president do?
20101221005700.000|20101221005702.000|TR0|
20101221005702.000|20101221005704.000|TR0|KUTTNER:  Well, he should resist it and he 
20101221005704.000|20101221005706.000|TR0|should make clear what he's for the way 
20101221005706.000|20101221005709.000|TR0|Truman did in 1948 when the Republicans 
20101221005709.000|20101221005711.000|TR0|blocked his whole program.  Truman made 
20101221005711.000|20101221005713.000|TR0|clear what he was for and the Democrats 
20101221005713.000|20101221005715.000|TR0|not only reelected Truman but they picked 
20101221005715.000|20101221005717.000|TR0|up 75 seats in the House in the election 
20101221005717.000|20101221005720.000|TR0|of '48.
20101221005720.000|20101221005722.000|TR0|
20101221005722.000|20101221005724.000|TR0|Where I think Grover is sort of arguing 
20101221005724.000|20101221005726.000|TR0|against himself is this. This program will 
20101221005726.000|20101221005729.000|TR0|slow down economic growth by cutting the 
20101221005729.000|20101221005731.000|TR0|deficit in the teeth of a recession, and 
20101221005731.000|20101221005733.000|TR0|that will defeat Obama.  So if he succeeds 
20101221005733.000|20101221005735.000|TR0|he may win politically by sacrificing the 
20101221005735.000|20101221005737.000|TR0|economy.
20101221005737.000|20101221005740.000|TR0|
20101221005740.000|20101221005742.000|TR0|KING:  Grover Norquist, Robert Kuttner, we 
20101221005742.000|20101221005744.000|TR0|appreciate your time. This is teeing up 
20101221005744.000|20101221005746.000|TR0|what will be the pivotal economical and 
20101221005746.000|20101221005749.000|TR0|spending debates of the next two years.  
20101221005749.000|20101221005751.000|TR0|Thanks.
20101221005751.000|20101221005753.000|TR0|
20101221005753.000|20101221005755.000|TR0|Up next, our reporter Pete Dominick, well, 
20101221005755.000|20101221005757.000|TR0|he wants to play "Stump the Anchor."

20101221005802.000|20101221005804.000|TR0|
20101221005804.000|20101221005806.000|TR0|KING:  Let's go straight to Offbeat Pete 
20101221005806.000|20101221005809.000|TR0|Dominick, who came to work today with some 
20101221005809.000|20101221005811.000|TR0|questions.  Pete?
20101221005811.000|20101221005813.000|TR0|
20101221005813.000|20101221005815.000|TR0|PETE DOMINICK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's 
20101221005815.000|20101221005817.000|TR0|right, John King.  I had a couple of other 
20101221005817.000|20101221005820.000|TR0|questions, but now what's tearing up the 
20101221005820.000|20101221005822.000|TR0|Internets, the blogs, is the governor of 
20101221005822.000|20101221005824.000|TR0|Mississippi in an interview with the 
20101221005824.000|20101221005826.000|TR0|"Weekly Standard" apparently praised the 
20101221005826.000|20101221005829.000|TR0|pro-segregationist Citizens Councils of 
20101221005829.000|20101221005831.000|TR0|the '60s.  Is Governor Haley Barbour, does 
20101221005831.000|20101221005833.000|TR0|this, John King, does this hurt his 
20101221005833.000|20101221005835.000|TR0|elections prospects?  You talked to him 
20101221005835.000|20101221005837.000|TR0|about running in 2012.  Is this going to 
20101221005837.000|20101221005840.000|TR0|hurt him?  What do you think?
20101221005840.000|20101221005842.000|TR0|
20101221005842.000|20101221005844.000|TR0|KING:  I've known Governor Barbour a long 
20101221005844.000|20101221005846.000|TR0|time and I don't believe him to be a 
20101221005846.000|20101221005849.000|TR0|racist.  He's a good man.  But we're going 
20101221005849.000|20101221005851.000|TR0|to try to get him right here to answer 
20101221005851.000|20101221005853.000|TR0|those questions, Pete.  So I'll let him 
20101221005853.000|20101221005855.000|TR0|speak for himself and we can book him 
20101221005855.000|20101221005857.000|TR0|right here.  You've got one more?
20101221005857.000|20101221005900.000|TR0|
20101221005900.000|20101221005902.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Yes.  Ed Henry, cushiest 
20101221005902.000|20101221005904.000|TR0|assignment, being in Hawaii without the 
20101221005904.000|20101221005906.000|TR0|president?  You worked in this job.

20101221005909.000|20101221005911.000|TR0|KING:  Being the senior White House 
20101221005911.000|20101221005913.000|TR0|correspondent has its advantages, my 
20101221005913.000|20101221005915.000|TR0|friends.  Ed is playing the senior card 
20101221005915.000|20101221005917.000|TR0|right now and he should enjoy it.  Pete,
