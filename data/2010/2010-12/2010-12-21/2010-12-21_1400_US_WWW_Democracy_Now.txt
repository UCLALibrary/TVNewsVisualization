20101221140432.788|20101221140434.293|TR0|to collect information about

20101221141228.272|20101221141229.777|TR0|to work, which aren't, and which 
20101221141229.777|20101221141231.282|TR0|are going to be able to get 
20101221141231.282|20101221141232.786|TR0|special treatment. Of course, 
20101221141232.786|20101221141234.291|TR0|that's going to be their own 
20101221141234.291|20101221141235.796|TR0|websites and services, a few 
20101221141235.796|20101221141237.301|TR0|select giant corporate partners, 
20101221141237.301|20101221141238.805|TR0|with the effect of slowing down 
20101221141238.805|20101221141240.310|TR0|everybody else and creating that 
20101221141240.310|20101221141241.815|TR0|divided highway that we've been 
20101221141241.815|20101221141243.319|TR0|fighting against for years.
20101221141243.319|20101221141244.824|TR0|
20101221141244.824|20101221141246.329|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Let's go back to 
20101221141246.329|20101221141247.833|TR0|this issue of wireless versus 
20101221141247.833|20101221141249.338|TR0|when you're wired in at home or 
20101221141249.338|20101221141250.843|TR0|at work - "wireless" meaning 
20101221141250.843|20101221141252.348|TR0|when your computer - you can go 
20101221141252.348|20101221141253.852|TR0|just anywhere. And explain how - 
20101221141253.852|20101221141255.357|TR0|the differences between the two 
20101221141255.357|20101221141256.862|TR0|and what will happen.
20101221141256.862|20101221141258.366|TR0|
20101221141258.366|20101221141259.871|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: Well, so, what 
20101221141259.871|20101221141301.376|TR0|we're talking about in terms of 
20101221141301.376|20101221141302.880|TR0|wireless or wireless devices, 
20101221141302.880|20101221141304.385|TR0|like mobile phones and iPads 
20101221141304.385|20101221141305.890|TR0|and, you know, many things that 
20101221141305.890|20101221141307.394|TR0|are being developed now, of 
20101221141307.394|20101221141308.899|TR0|course, this is the future of 
20101221141308.899|20101221141310.404|TR0|the internet, you know, not 
20101221141310.404|20101221141311.909|TR0|using a cable connection or a 
20101221141311.909|20101221141313.413|TR0|fiber connection directly into 
20101221141313.413|20101221141314.918|TR0|your living room or office, but, 
20101221141314.918|20101221141316.423|TR0|of course, being out there using 
20101221141316.423|20101221141317.927|TR0|mobile technology, cellular 
20101221141317.927|20101221141319.432|TR0|technology. That's the future of 
20101221141319.432|20101221141320.937|TR0|the wireless internet. Many 
20101221141320.937|20101221141322.441|TR0|people, that's becoming their 
20101221141322.441|20101221141323.946|TR0|primary connection, especially 
20101221141323.946|20101221141325.451|TR0|in low-income communities, 
20101221141325.451|20101221141326.956|TR0|especially in minority 
20101221141326.956|20101221141328.460|TR0|communities. And this rule -
20101221141328.460|20101221141329.965|TR0|
20101221141329.965|20101221141331.470|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And explain how 
20101221141331.470|20101221141332.974|TR0|they'll be treated differently.
20101221141332.974|20101221141334.479|TR0|
20101221141334.479|20101221141335.984|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: - unfortunately, 
20101221141335.984|20101221141337.488|TR0|doesn't extend those protections.
20101221141337.488|20101221141338.993|TR0|
20101221141338.993|20101221141340.498|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Explain how then 
20101221141340.498|20101221141342.002|TR0|they will be treated differently.
20101221141342.002|20101221141343.507|TR0|
20101221141343.507|20101221141345.012|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: Well, there's 
20101221141345.012|20101221141346.517|TR0|simply the rules - sure. The 
20101221141346.517|20101221141348.021|TR0|rules simply will not apply to 
20101221141348.021|20101221141349.526|TR0|wireless connections, so there 
20101221141349.526|20101221141351.031|TR0|won't be any net neutrality 
20101221141351.031|20101221141352.535|TR0|protections in the wireless 
20101221141352.535|20101221141354.040|TR0|space. And that means that these 
20101221141354.040|20101221141355.545|TR0|wireless providers will be free 
20101221141355.545|20101221141357.049|TR0|to discriminate. They can decide 
20101221141357.049|20101221141358.554|TR0|to favor certain services over 
20101221141358.554|20101221141400.059|TR0|others. For example, if AT&T 
20101221141400.059|20101221141401.564|TR0|wants to develop a video 
20101221141401.564|20101221141403.068|TR0|service, they can give that 
20101221141403.068|20101221141404.573|TR0|priority treatment while slowing 
20101221141404.573|20101221141406.078|TR0|down or blocking Netflix. They 
20101221141406.078|20101221141407.582|TR0|could do that with any different 
20101221141407.582|20101221141409.087|TR0|kind of service that you would 
20101221141409.087|20101221141410.592|TR0|be able to access on the 
20101221141410.592|20101221141412.096|TR0|internet. And so, the effect is, 
20101221141412.096|20101221141413.601|TR0|essentially, creating two 
20101221141413.601|20101221141415.106|TR0|internets - one for wired users, 
20101221141415.106|20101221141416.610|TR0|one for wireless users - and 
20101221141416.610|20101221141418.115|TR0|basically condoning 
20101221141418.115|20101221141419.620|TR0|discrimination in the wireless 
20101221141419.620|20101221141421.125|TR0|space, which is the future of 
20101221141421.125|20101221141422.629|TR0|the internet. And that's really 
20101221141422.629|20101221141424.134|TR0|the biggest flaw with what the 
20101221141424.134|20101221141425.639|TR0|FCC chairman is proposing today 
20101221141425.639|20101221141427.143|TR0|and what apparently is going to 
20101221141427.143|20101221141428.648|TR0|be voted out.
20101221141428.648|20101221141430.153|TR0|
20101221141430.153|20101221141431.657|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, we're 
20101221141431.657|20101221141433.162|TR0|talking today about President 
20101221141433.162|20101221141434.667|TR0|Obama's appointee, right, the 
20101221141434.667|20101221141436.172|TR0|FCC commissioner, and -
20101221141436.172|20101221141437.676|TR0|
20101221141437.676|20101221141439.181|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: That's right.
20101221141439.181|20101221141440.686|TR0|
20101221141440.686|20101221141442.190|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: - the person who 
20101221141442.190|20101221141443.695|TR0|many consider the champion of 
20101221141443.695|20101221141445.200|TR0|media democracy, and that is 
20101221141445.200|20101221141446.704|TR0|Commissioner Copps, along with 
20101221141446.704|20101221141448.209|TR0|the other Democratic appointee, 
20101221141448.209|20101221141449.714|TR0|Clyburn. Explain how this is the 
20101221141449.714|20101221141451.218|TR0|bloc that is voting for this.
20101221141451.218|20101221141452.723|TR0|
20101221141452.723|20101221141454.228|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: Well, I wish I 
20101221141454.228|20101221141455.733|TR0|had a good explanation. It's 
20101221141455.733|20101221141457.237|TR0|very disappointing that they 
20101221141457.237|20101221141458.742|TR0|have decided to go forward with 
20101221141458.742|20101221141500.247|TR0|this. I think this is party 
20101221141500.247|20101221141501.751|TR0|loyalty, unfortunately, trumping 
20101221141501.751|20101221141503.256|TR0|the public interest in this 
20101221141503.256|20101221141504.761|TR0|case. And they have decided - 
20101221141504.761|20101221141506.265|TR0|it's our understanding that 
20101221141506.265|20101221141507.770|TR0|Commissioner Copps, Commissioner 
20101221141507.770|20101221141509.275|TR0|Clyburn tried to improve these 
20101221141509.275|20101221141510.780|TR0|rules, that the chairman refused 
20101221141510.780|20101221141512.284|TR0|to budge, apparently because he 
20101221141512.284|20101221141513.789|TR0|had already reached an agreement 
20101221141513.789|20101221141515.294|TR0|with AT&T and the cable 
20101221141515.294|20101221141516.798|TR0|lobbyists about how far these 
20101221141516.798|20101221141518.303|TR0|rules were going to go. And in 
20101221141518.303|20101221141519.808|TR0|their calculation, they decided 
20101221141519.808|20101221141521.312|TR0|to support these rules to put in 
20101221141521.312|20101221141522.817|TR0|the half measures or the partial 
20101221141522.817|20101221141524.322|TR0|net neutrality, and they have 
20101221141524.322|20101221141525.826|TR0|decided to vote for it. I think 
20101221141525.826|20101221141527.331|TR0|that's very disappointing. And 
20101221141527.331|20101221141528.836|TR0|unfortunately, this is just 
20101221141528.836|20101221141530.341|TR0|another example of a major 
20101221141530.341|20101221141531.845|TR0|squandered opportunity.
20101221141531.845|20101221141533.350|TR0|
20101221141533.350|20101221141534.855|TR0|There are millions and millions 
20101221141534.855|20101221141536.359|TR0|of Americans who have contacted 
20101221141536.359|20101221141537.864|TR0|the FCC. Ninety percent of the 
20101221141537.864|20101221141539.369|TR0|comments they received were 
20101221141539.369|20101221141540.873|TR0|supporting strong net 
20101221141540.873|20101221141542.378|TR0|neutrality. Commissioners Copps 
20101221141542.378|20101221141543.883|TR0|and Clyburn went across the 
20101221141543.883|20101221141545.388|TR0|country, heard from people all 
20101221141545.388|20101221141546.892|TR0|across the country about how 
20101221141546.892|20101221141548.397|TR0|important net neutrality is. But 
20101221141548.397|20101221141549.902|TR0|unfortunately, this is another 
20101221141549.902|20101221141551.406|TR0|example where the Obama 
20101221141551.406|20101221141552.911|TR0|administration has, you know, 
20101221141552.911|20101221141554.416|TR0|put forward a compromise on a 
20101221141554.416|20101221141555.920|TR0|compromise on a compromise and 
20101221141555.920|20101221141557.425|TR0|asked the American public to 
20101221141557.425|20101221141558.930|TR0|swallow it, while the companies 
20101221141558.930|20101221141600.435|TR0|really haven't had to give up 
20101221141600.435|20101221141601.939|TR0|very much at all. And that's 
20101221141601.939|20101221141603.444|TR0|where we are today.

20101221141606.453|20101221141607.958|TR0|Clyburn is the daughter of the

20101221141609.463|20101221141610.967|TR0|Clyburn of South Carolina. And 
20101221141610.967|20101221141612.472|TR0|the Republicans are opposed to 
20101221141612.472|20101221141613.977|TR0|this, the two Republican

20101221141616.986|20101221141618.491|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: Well, that's 
20101221141618.491|20101221141619.996|TR0|right. And in the strange 
20101221141619.996|20101221141621.500|TR0|politics of Washington these 
20101221141621.500|20101221141623.005|TR0|days, the Republicans oppose any 
20101221141623.005|20101221141624.510|TR0|kind of regulation whatsoever, 
20101221141624.510|20101221141626.014|TR0|so they're making all sorts of 
20101221141626.014|20101221141627.519|TR0|noise that this is some kind of 
20101221141627.519|20101221141629.024|TR0|massive overreach, when it 
20101221141629.024|20101221141630.528|TR0|couldn't be further from the 
20101221141630.528|20101221141632.033|TR0|truth. But this is the game that 
20101221141632.033|20101221141633.538|TR0|the big phone and cable 
20101221141633.538|20101221141635.043|TR0|companies are playing. They've 
20101221141635.043|20101221141636.547|TR0|asked their Republican allies to 
20101221141636.547|20101221141638.052|TR0|make a lot of noise, talk about 
20101221141638.052|20101221141639.557|TR0|how any kind of regulation is 
20101221141639.557|20101221141641.061|TR0|bad, trying to force the FCC 
20101221141641.061|20101221141642.566|TR0|chairman and the Democrats on 
20101221141642.566|20101221141644.071|TR0|the Commission into this really 
20101221141644.071|20101221141645.575|TR0|false middle and trying to 
20101221141645.575|20101221141647.080|TR0|portray champions of net 
20101221141647.080|20101221141648.585|TR0|neutrality, public interest 
20101221141648.585|20101221141650.089|TR0|advocates, as some kind of 
20101221141650.089|20101221141651.594|TR0|extremists.
20101221141651.594|20101221141653.099|TR0|
20101221141653.099|20101221141654.604|TR0|Unfortunately, the only thing 
20101221141654.604|20101221141656.108|TR0|we're left with here is an 
20101221141656.108|20101221141657.613|TR0|extremely disappointing order 
20101221141657.613|20101221141659.118|TR0|that won't give the American 
20101221141659.118|20101221141700.622|TR0|public the protections they 
20101221141700.622|20101221141702.127|TR0|need, that won't give internet 
20101221141702.127|20101221141703.632|TR0|users the protections that they 
20101221141703.632|20101221141705.136|TR0|need and, I think, really 
20101221141705.136|20101221141706.641|TR0|jeopardizes the internet's 
20101221141706.641|20101221141708.146|TR0|continued growth as an unrivaled 
20101221141708.146|20101221141709.651|TR0|source of economic innovation, 
20101221141709.651|20101221141711.155|TR0|of democratic participation, of 
20101221141711.155|20101221141712.660|TR0|free speech. This is a very big 
20101221141712.660|20101221141714.165|TR0|step in the wrong direction by 
20101221141714.165|20101221141715.669|TR0|the FCC today and, I think, a 
20101221141715.669|20101221141717.174|TR0|very big disappointment to 
20101221141717.174|20101221141718.679|TR0|everybody who believed not just 
20101221141718.679|20101221141720.183|TR0|President Obama, but Chairman 
20101221141720.183|20101221141721.688|TR0|Genachowski, when he, you know, 
20101221141721.688|20101221141723.193|TR0|spoke up and said he was going 
20101221141723.193|20101221141724.697|TR0|to protect the free and open 
20101221141724.697|20101221141726.202|TR0|internet no matter what.

20101221141729.212|20101221141730.716|TR0|this vote could be changed 
20101221141730.716|20101221141732.221|TR0|today? Do you think powerful 
20101221141732.221|20101221141733.726|TR0|pressure could make a difference?
20101221141733.726|20101221141735.230|TR0|
20101221141735.230|20101221141736.735|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: Well, I 
20101221141736.735|20101221141738.240|TR0|certainly don't think - the 
20101221141738.240|20101221141739.744|TR0|fight is far from over. And, you 
20101221141739.744|20101221141741.249|TR0|know, we'll see what happens on 
20101221141741.249|20101221141742.754|TR0|the vote today. All indications 
20101221141742.754|20101221141744.259|TR0|are they're going to move 
20101221141744.259|20101221141745.763|TR0|forward with these rules, and 
20101221141745.763|20101221141747.268|TR0|there's no question the devil 
20101221141747.268|20101221141748.773|TR0|will be in the details. So we'll 
20101221141748.773|20101221141750.277|TR0|have to look very carefully at 
20101221141750.277|20101221141751.782|TR0|what exactly is in these rules, 
20101221141751.782|20101221141753.287|TR0|how big are the loopholes, what 
20101221141753.287|20101221141754.791|TR0|are perhaps some of the good 
20101221141754.791|20101221141756.296|TR0|things, like increased 
20101221141756.296|20101221141757.801|TR0|transparency that will allow us 
20101221141757.801|20101221141759.305|TR0|to expose the bad actions of the 
20101221141759.305|20101221141800.810|TR0|phone and cable companies going 
20101221141800.810|20101221141802.315|TR0|forward. We'll be exploring and 
20101221141802.315|20101221141803.820|TR0|pursuing any legal options that 
20101221141803.820|20101221141805.324|TR0|are out there to improve these 
20101221141805.324|20101221141806.829|TR0|rules or, if necessary, 
20101221141806.829|20101221141808.334|TR0|challenge them. And then we'll 
20101221141808.334|20101221141809.838|TR0|begin, starting tomorrow, 
20101221141809.838|20101221141811.343|TR0|campaigning to fix these rules, 
20101221141811.343|20101221141812.848|TR0|to improve them, to bolster our 
20101221141812.848|20101221141814.352|TR0|champions on the Hill, like 
20101221141814.352|20101221141815.857|TR0|Senator Al Franken, who have 
20101221141815.857|20101221141817.362|TR0|spoken out strongly against what 
20101221141817.362|20101221141818.867|TR0|the FCC is doing. And we'll 
20101221141818.867|20101221141820.371|TR0|begin that fight to make sure 
20101221141820.371|20101221141821.876|TR0|the free and open internet stays 
20101221141821.876|20101221141823.381|TR0|that way.

20101221141826.390|20101221141827.895|TR0|
20101221141827.895|20101221141829.399|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: This is 
20101221141829.399|20101221141830.904|TR0|certainly not the end of that 
20101221141830.904|20101221141832.409|TR0|fight. It's a setback.
20101221141832.409|20101221141833.913|TR0|
20101221141833.913|20101221141835.418|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I can't help - I 
20101221141835.418|20101221141836.923|TR0|can't help but think back three 
20101221141836.923|20101221141838.428|TR0|years ago - two-and-a-half years 
20101221141838.428|20101221141839.932|TR0|ago. It was the first - the 
20101221141839.932|20101221141841.437|TR0|night before the opening night 
20101221141841.437|20101221141842.942|TR0|of the Democratic convention in 
20101221141842.942|20101221141844.446|TR0|Denver. One of the first parties 
20101221141844.446|20101221141845.951|TR0|held was thrown by AT&T. Us - 
20101221141845.951|20101221141847.456|TR0|the reporters could not get in. 
20101221141847.456|20101221141848.960|TR0|Delegates were streaming in. And 
20101221141848.960|20101221141850.465|TR0|they were holding it for the 
20101221141850.465|20101221141851.970|TR0|Democrats, because they had 
20101221141851.970|20101221141853.475|TR0|turned around, particularly 
20101221141853.475|20101221141854.979|TR0|Senator Obama at the time, who 
20101221141854.979|20101221141856.484|TR0|said he would never grant 
20101221141856.484|20101221141857.989|TR0|retroactive immunity to the 
20101221141857.989|20101221141859.493|TR0|telecoms, but then turned around 
20101221141859.493|20101221141900.998|TR0|- they granted retroactive 
20101221141900.998|20101221141902.503|TR0|immunity for spying on the 
20101221141902.503|20101221141904.007|TR0|American people, and this big 
20101221141904.007|20101221141905.512|TR0|party was held. And I remember 
20101221141905.512|20101221141907.017|TR0|on Democracy Now! at the time 
20101221141907.017|20101221141908.522|TR0|holding up the DNC bag that all 
20101221141908.522|20101221141910.026|TR0|the delegates were getting, and 
20101221141910.026|20101221141911.531|TR0|there was the logo emblazoned on 
20101221141911.531|20101221141913.036|TR0|it that said "AT&T" on that bag. 
20101221141913.036|20101221141914.540|TR0|Craig Aaron, talk about who 
20101221141914.540|20101221141916.045|TR0|profits here and the amount of 
20101221141916.045|20101221141917.550|TR0|contributions that are flooding 
20101221141917.550|20101221141919.054|TR0|Congress now from the telecom 
20101221141919.054|20101221141920.559|TR0|companies.
20101221141920.559|20101221141922.064|TR0|
20101221141922.064|20101221141923.568|TR0|>> CRAIG AARON: Well, as you may 
20101221141923.568|20101221141925.073|TR0|know, the phone and cable 
20101221141925.073|20101221141926.578|TR0|company lobby is one of the 
20101221141926.578|20101221141928.083|TR0|biggest in Washington. In recent 
20101221141928.083|20101221141929.587|TR0|years, they've deployed 500 
20101221141929.587|20101221141931.092|TR0|lobbyists, basically one for 
20101221141931.092|20101221141932.597|TR0|every member of Congress, and 
20101221141932.597|20101221141934.101|TR0|that's just what they report. 
20101221141934.101|20101221141935.606|TR0|AT&T is the biggest campaign 
20101221141935.606|20101221141937.111|TR0|giver in the history of campaign 
20101221141937.111|20101221141938.615|TR0|giving, as long as we have been 
20101221141938.615|20101221141940.120|TR0|tracking it. So they have really 
20101221141940.120|20101221141941.625|TR0|entrenched themselves. And 
20101221141941.625|20101221141943.130|TR0|Comcast, Verizon, the other big 
20101221141943.130|20101221141944.634|TR0|companies, are not far behind. 
20101221141944.634|20101221141946.139|TR0|And we're really seeing that 
20101221141946.139|20101221141947.644|TR0|play out here, you know, once 
20101221141947.644|20101221141949.148|TR0|again, the big powerful 
20101221141949.148|20101221141950.653|TR0|corporate interests using their 
20101221141950.653|20101221141952.158|TR0|lobbying clout, using their 
20101221141952.158|20101221141953.662|TR0|campaign contributions, to undo 
20101221141953.662|20101221141955.167|TR0|any threat to their power, to 
20101221141955.167|20101221141956.672|TR0|their plans for what they want 
20101221141956.672|20101221141958.176|TR0|to do for the future of the 
20101221141958.176|20101221141959.681|TR0|internet.
20101221141959.681|20101221142001.186|TR0|
20101221142001.186|20101221142002.691|TR0|And there's no question that 
20101221142002.691|20101221142004.195|TR0|AT&T's fingerprints are all over 
20101221142004.195|20101221142005.700|TR0|the FCC's order today, and it 
20101221142005.700|20101221142007.205|TR0|seems that the FCC chairman was 
20101221142007.205|20101221142008.709|TR0|unwilling to [improve] this 
20101221142008.709|20101221142010.214|TR0|rule, because he was afraid that 
20101221142010.214|20101221142011.719|TR0|AT&T would walk away. And I 
20101221142011.719|20101221142013.223|TR0|guess that tells you everything 
20101221142013.223|20101221142014.728|TR0|you need to know. When you read 
20101221142014.728|20101221142016.233|TR0|AT&T's positive statement today 
20101221142016.233|20101221142017.738|TR0|about what the FCC is doing, 
20101221142017.738|20101221142019.242|TR0|that's a very telling statement 
20101221142019.242|20101221142020.747|TR0|and a very far cry from what 
20101221142020.747|20101221142022.252|TR0|President Obama and Julius 
20101221142022.252|20101221142023.756|TR0|Genachowski had promised to do 
20101221142023.756|20101221142025.261|TR0|once they get into office.
20101221142025.261|20101221142026.766|TR0|
20101221142026.766|20101221142028.270|TR0|But unfortunately - and this is 
20101221142028.270|20101221142029.775|TR0|something we need to change in 
20101221142029.775|20101221142031.280|TR0|Washington - that's how it 
20101221142031.280|20101221142032.784|TR0|works. You know, when AT&T wants 
20101221142032.784|20101221142034.289|TR0|to get together all of their 
20101221142034.289|20101221142035.794|TR0|lobbyists, there's no room big 
20101221142035.794|20101221142037.299|TR0|enough. They had to rent out a 
20101221142037.299|20101221142038.803|TR0|movie theater. People from the 
20101221142038.803|20101221142040.308|TR0|public interest who are fighting 
20101221142040.308|20101221142041.813|TR0|for the free and open internet, 
20101221142041.813|20101221142043.317|TR0|you know, here in D.C., they can 
20101221142043.317|20101221142044.822|TR0|still share a cab. So we have a 
20101221142044.822|20101221142046.327|TR0|lot of work to do to undo the 
20101221142046.327|20101221142047.831|TR0|power of these big companies and 
20101221142047.831|20101221142049.336|TR0|challenge them. We had been very 
20101221142049.336|20101221142050.841|TR0|hopeful that the Obama 
20101221142050.841|20101221142052.346|TR0|administration was going to take 
20101221142052.346|20101221142053.850|TR0|steps in that direction, but 
20101221142053.850|20101221142055.355|TR0|it's very clear that we're going 
20101221142055.355|20101221142056.860|TR0|have to go back to the drawing 
20101221142056.860|20101221142058.364|TR0|board and really challenge this 
20101221142058.364|20101221142059.869|TR0|corporate power at every turn, 
20101221142059.869|20101221142101.374|TR0|because we've seen time and time 
20101221142101.374|20101221142102.878|TR0|again how damaging it can be to 
20101221142102.878|20101221142104.383|TR0|free speech and innovation.

20101221142105.888|20101221142107.392|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Craig Aaron, I 
20101221142107.392|20101221142108.897|TR0|want to thank you very much for 
20101221142108.897|20101221142110.402|TR0|being with us, managing director 
20101221142110.402|20101221142111.907|TR0|of the media reform group Free 
20101221142111.907|20101221142113.411|TR0|Press, and end with a quote of 
20101221142113.411|20101221142114.916|TR0|Senator Al Franken, who said, 
20101221142114.916|20101221142116.421|TR0|"Mobile networks like AT&T and 
20101221142116.421|20101221142117.925|TR0|Verizon Wireless would be able 
20101221142117.925|20101221142119.430|TR0|to shut off your access to 
20101221142119.430|20101221142120.935|TR0|content or applications for any 
20101221142120.935|20101221142122.439|TR0|reason. For instance, Verizon 
20101221142122.439|20101221142123.944|TR0|could prevent you from accessing 
20101221142123.944|20101221142125.449|TR0|Google Maps on your phone, 
20101221142125.449|20101221142126.954|TR0|forcing you to use [their] own 
20101221142126.954|20101221142128.458|TR0|mapping program, Verizon 
20101221142128.458|20101221142129.963|TR0|Navigator, even if it costs 
20101221142129.963|20101221142131.468|TR0|money to use and isn't nearly as 
20101221142131.468|20101221142132.972|TR0|good." Those were the words of 
20101221142132.972|20101221142134.477|TR0|Senator Al Franken.

20101221142138.991|20101221142140.496|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Today's FCC vote 
20101221142140.496|20101221142142.000|TR0|on net neutrality comes just as 
20101221142142.000|20101221142143.505|TR0|community radio advocates are 
20101221142143.505|20101221142145.010|TR0|actually celebrating a major 
20101221142145.010|20101221142146.515|TR0|victory on Capitol Hill. On 
20101221142146.515|20101221142148.019|TR0|Saturday, the Senate approved 
20101221142148.019|20101221142149.524|TR0|the Local Community Radio Act, 
20101221142149.524|20101221142151.029|TR0|one day after its passage in the 
20101221142151.029|20101221142152.533|TR0|House. The bill will open up 
20101221142152.533|20101221142154.038|TR0|more of the radio dial for Low 
20101221142154.038|20101221142155.543|TR0|Power FM, with the FCC now 
20101221142155.543|20101221142157.047|TR0|mandated to license thousands of 
20101221142157.047|20101221142158.552|TR0|new stations. The measure 
20101221142158.552|20101221142200.057|TR0|repeals legislation that limited 
20101221142200.057|20101221142201.562|TR0|most Low Power FM stations to 
20101221142201.562|20101221142203.066|TR0|rural areas because large 
20101221142203.066|20101221142204.571|TR0|broadcasters claimed 
20101221142204.571|20101221142206.076|TR0|interference with their signals.

20101221142237.674|20101221142239.179|TR0|advocates -

20101221142248.207|20101221142249.712|TR0|>> HANNAH SASSAMAN: Yeah, it's 
20101221142249.712|20101221142251.217|TR0|really exciting, Amy, that at 
20101221142251.217|20101221142252.721|TR0|the 11th hour of the 111th 
20101221142252.721|20101221142254.226|TR0|Congress, that a bipartisan team 
20101221142254.226|20101221142255.731|TR0|of senators, of Congress 
20101221142255.731|20101221142257.235|TR0|members, realized that community 
20101221142257.235|20101221142258.740|TR0|radio was something that was 
20101221142258.740|20101221142300.245|TR0|long in coming, that so many 
20101221142300.245|20101221142301.749|TR0|people were fighting to get 
20101221142301.749|20101221142303.254|TR0|these stations in their cities 
20101221142303.254|20101221142304.759|TR0|in an era of media 
20101221142304.759|20101221142306.263|TR0|consolidation, when companies - 
20101221142306.263|20101221142307.768|TR0|frankly, like AT&T, like big 
20101221142307.768|20101221142309.273|TR0|broadcasters like Clear Channel 
20101221142309.273|20101221142310.778|TR0|- take so many of our voices off 
20101221142310.778|20101221142312.282|TR0|the air and just promote 
20101221142312.282|20101221142313.787|TR0|commercialism and just promote 
20101221142313.787|20101221142315.292|TR0|whatever their agendas are. This 
20101221142315.292|20101221142316.796|TR0|is an opportunity to truly put 
20101221142316.796|20101221142318.301|TR0|local people on the FM dial.
20101221142318.301|20101221142319.806|TR0|
20101221142319.806|20101221142321.310|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So, explain what 
20101221142321.310|20101221142322.815|TR0|happened. You've been fighting 
20101221142322.815|20101221142324.320|TR0|for this for 10 years. 
20101221142324.320|20101221142325.825|TR0|Prometheus Radio Project has

20101221142328.834|20101221142330.339|TR0|>> HANNAH SASSAMAN: Sure.
20101221142330.339|20101221142331.843|TR0|
20101221142331.843|20101221142333.348|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Explain who was 
20101221142333.348|20101221142334.853|TR0|holding it back and how you 
20101221142334.853|20101221142336.357|TR0|trumped the National Association 
20101221142336.357|20101221142337.862|TR0|of Broadcasters.
20101221142337.862|20101221142339.367|TR0|
20101221142339.367|20101221142340.871|TR0|>> HANNAH SASSAMAN: So, for 10 
20101221142340.871|20101221142342.376|TR0|years, community groups have 
20101221142342.376|20101221142343.881|TR0|tried to get on the FM dial all 
20101221142343.881|20101221142345.386|TR0|over the country, but in 2000, 
20101221142345.386|20101221142346.890|TR0|when the FCC established the Low 
20101221142346.890|20101221142348.395|TR0|Power FM radio service - 
20101221142348.395|20101221142349.900|TR0|noncommercial 100-watt stations 
20101221142349.900|20101221142351.404|TR0|meant to put true community 
20101221142351.404|20101221142352.909|TR0|voices on the air - the NAB and 
20101221142352.909|20101221142354.414|TR0|other big broadcasters convinced 
20101221142354.414|20101221142355.918|TR0|Congress to limit Low Power FM 
20101221142355.918|20101221142357.423|TR0|to only very rural areas. So 
20101221142357.423|20101221142358.928|TR0|there wouldn't be a Low Power FM 
20101221142358.928|20101221142400.433|TR0|in a city like Philadelphia, 
20101221142400.433|20101221142401.937|TR0|where the school district 
20101221142401.937|20101221142403.442|TR0|applied. The closest one would 
20101221142403.442|20101221142404.947|TR0|be in a city like Altoona, many 
20101221142404.947|20101221142406.451|TR0|hundreds of miles away. New 
20101221142406.451|20101221142407.956|TR0|Orleans didn't get any stations. 
20101221142407.956|20101221142409.461|TR0|The closest LPFM is in 
20101221142409.461|20101221142410.965|TR0|Opelousas, Louisiana, licensed 
20101221142410.965|20101221142412.470|TR0|to a civil rights organization.

20101221142413.975|20101221142415.479|TR0|So, for 10 years, after a $2.2 
20101221142415.479|20101221142416.984|TR0|million congressionally mandated 
20101221142416.984|20101221142418.489|TR0|Federal Communications 
20101221142418.489|20101221142419.994|TR0|Commission study proving that 
20101221142419.994|20101221142421.498|TR0|there was no interference from 
20101221142421.498|20101221142423.003|TR0|these 100-watt voices on the FM 
20101221142423.003|20101221142424.508|TR0|dial, we fought, we built a 
20101221142424.508|20101221142426.012|TR0|coalition as diverse as the 
20101221142426.012|20101221142427.517|TR0|Christian Coalition and the 
20101221142427.517|20101221142429.022|TR0|Leadership Conference on Civil 
20101221142429.022|20101221142430.526|TR0|and Human Rights, we got 
20101221142430.526|20101221142432.031|TR0|bipartisan senators and Congress 
20101221142432.031|20101221142433.536|TR0|members to support it. And by 
20101221142433.536|20101221142435.041|TR0|getting thousands of calls in 
20101221142435.041|20101221142436.545|TR0|from truly grassroots people 
20101221142436.545|20101221142438.050|TR0|into these senators' offices, 
20101221142438.050|20101221142439.555|TR0|the NAB would try to get a 
20101221142439.555|20101221142441.059|TR0|senator to organize a secret 
20101221142441.059|20101221142442.564|TR0|hold blocking the bill. So time 
20101221142442.564|20101221142444.069|TR0|kept on running. We kept on 
20101221142444.069|20101221142445.573|TR0|worrying that we would lose. But 
20101221142445.573|20101221142447.078|TR0|then we would get everyone, from 
20101221142447.078|20101221142448.583|TR0|local Catholic leaders in 
20101221142448.583|20101221142450.087|TR0|Alabama to high schools in 
20101221142450.087|20101221142451.592|TR0|Wyoming, to call those senators, 
20101221142451.592|20101221142453.097|TR0|and they said people really want 
20101221142453.097|20101221142454.602|TR0|this service. There is no 
20101221142454.602|20101221142456.106|TR0|technical problem. The senators 
20101221142456.106|20101221142457.611|TR0|dropped their holds. The NAB was 
20101221142457.611|20101221142459.116|TR0|forced to negotiate. And now 
20101221142459.116|20101221142500.620|TR0|there'll be thousands of 
20101221142500.620|20101221142502.125|TR0|stations around the country.
20101221142502.125|20101221142503.630|TR0|
20101221142503.630|20101221142505.134|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, explain 
20101221142505.134|20101221142506.639|TR0|exactly what LPFM is, Low Power 
20101221142506.639|20101221142508.144|TR0|FM.
20101221142508.144|20101221142509.649|TR0|
20101221142509.649|20101221142511.153|TR0|>> HANNAH SASSAMAN: Sure. So, 
20101221142511.153|20101221142512.658|TR0|across the United States, there 
20101221142512.658|20101221142514.163|TR0|are full-power stations, you 
20101221142514.163|20101221142515.667|TR0|know, commercial stations, 
20101221142515.667|20101221142517.172|TR0|there's public radio, and 
20101221142517.172|20101221142518.677|TR0|there's something called Low 
20101221142518.677|20101221142520.181|TR0|Power FM. These are stations 
20101221142520.181|20101221142521.686|TR0|that broadcast about three to 
20101221142521.686|20101221142523.191|TR0|five miles, power of a light 
20101221142523.191|20101221142524.696|TR0|bulb, 100 watts. They are always 
20101221142524.696|20101221142526.200|TR0|local. You can't really own one 
20101221142526.200|20101221142527.705|TR0|5,000 miles away; you have to 
20101221142527.705|20101221142529.210|TR0|own one in your community. 
20101221142529.210|20101221142530.714|TR0|They're always licensed to 
20101221142530.714|20101221142532.219|TR0|nonprofit community 
20101221142532.219|20101221142533.724|TR0|organizations. And you have to 
20101221142533.724|20101221142535.228|TR0|put some local content on the 
20101221142535.228|20101221142536.733|TR0|air.
20101221142536.733|20101221142538.238|TR0|
20101221142538.238|20101221142539.742|TR0|They're truly meant to 
20101221142539.742|20101221142541.247|TR0|ameliorate what happened in 
20101221142541.247|20101221142542.752|TR0|Minot, North Dakota in 2001, 
20101221142542.752|20101221142544.257|TR0|when a train went through town 
20101221142544.257|20101221142545.761|TR0|in the middle of the night, it 
20101221142545.761|20101221142547.266|TR0|derailed, it poured a poison gas 
20101221142547.266|20101221142548.771|TR0|cloud over the town. When the 
20101221142548.771|20101221142550.275|TR0|police tried to alert the 
20101221142550.275|20101221142551.780|TR0|emergency alert system, it 
20101221142551.780|20101221142553.285|TR0|didn't work, because all six 
20101221142553.285|20101221142554.789|TR0|stations in town were owned by 
20101221142554.789|20101221142556.294|TR0|Clear Channel. They were being 
20101221142556.294|20101221142557.799|TR0|run on autopilot. And a huge 
20101221142557.799|20101221142559.304|TR0|amount of damage was done. So, 
20101221142559.304|20101221142600.808|TR0|Low Power FM is meant to put 
20101221142600.808|20101221142602.313|TR0|truly community voices on the FM 
20101221142602.313|20101221142603.818|TR0|dial. And now people around the 
20101221142603.818|20101221142605.322|TR0|country should get very excited, 
20101221142605.322|20101221142606.827|TR0|because we can now get ready to 
20101221142606.827|20101221142608.332|TR0|apply for these stations in our 
20101221142608.332|20101221142609.836|TR0|own communities, for civil 
20101221142609.836|20101221142611.341|TR0|rights groups, environmental 
20101221142611.341|20101221142612.846|TR0|organizations, immigrants 
20101221142612.846|20101221142614.350|TR0|groups. It's a very exciting 
20101221142614.350|20101221142615.855|TR0|time.
20101221142615.855|20101221142617.360|TR0|
20101221142617.360|20101221142618.865|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: How do people 
20101221142618.865|20101221142620.369|TR0|apply for these stations?
20101221142620.369|20101221142621.874|TR0|
20101221142621.874|20101221142623.379|TR0|>> HANNAH SASSAMAN: So the FCC 
20101221142623.379|20101221142624.883|TR0|will open up what's called a 
20101221142624.883|20101221142626.388|TR0|licensing window. We're not sure 
20101221142626.388|20101221142627.893|TR0|exactly when. We at Prometheus 
20101221142627.893|20101221142629.397|TR0|are very excited to be working 
20101221142629.397|20101221142630.902|TR0|at the FCC to make a window 
20101221142630.902|20101221142632.407|TR0|happen as soon as possible. But 
20101221142632.407|20101221142633.912|TR0|now is the time to organize your 
20101221142633.912|20101221142635.416|TR0|group to think about what a 
20101221142635.416|20101221142636.921|TR0|community station can truly do 
20101221142636.921|20101221142638.426|TR0|in your town.
20101221142638.426|20101221142639.930|TR0|
20101221142639.930|20101221142641.435|TR0|I love thinking about the 
20101221142641.435|20101221142642.940|TR0|Esperanza Peace and Justice 
20101221142642.940|20101221142644.444|TR0|Center in San Antonio. They 
20101221142644.444|20101221142645.949|TR0|fought to make sure that the 
20101221142645.949|20101221142647.454|TR0|golf association doesn't build a 
20101221142647.454|20101221142648.958|TR0|course over their pure aquifer. 
20101221142648.958|20101221142650.463|TR0|They fought to protect the right 
20101221142650.463|20101221142651.968|TR0|to protest in the streets of San 
20101221142651.968|20101221142653.473|TR0|Antonio, and people are working 
20101221142653.473|20101221142654.977|TR0|across color lines, across 
20101221142654.977|20101221142656.482|TR0|gender lines, across class lines 
20101221142656.482|20101221142657.987|TR0|in that city. A local community 
20101221142657.987|20101221142659.491|TR0|radio station right there at the 
20101221142659.491|20101221142700.996|TR0|Esperanza Center will 
20101221142700.996|20101221142702.501|TR0|revolutionize their ability to 
20101221142702.501|20101221142704.005|TR0|make change. That's what I'm 
20101221142704.005|20101221142705.510|TR0|hoping that the people of this 
20101221142705.510|20101221142707.015|TR0|country are ready to do.
20101221142707.015|20101221142708.520|TR0|
20101221142708.520|20101221142710.024|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: NAB is run by

20101221142716.043|20101221142717.548|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Who were this 
20101221142717.548|20101221142719.052|TR0|senators who were secretly 
20101221142719.052|20101221142720.557|TR0|putting holds on this?
20101221142720.557|20101221142722.062|TR0|
20101221142722.062|20101221142723.566|TR0|>> HANNAH SASSAMAN: It was 
20101221142723.566|20101221142725.071|TR0|pretty interesting. Senator 
20101221142725.071|20101221142726.576|TR0|Smith and his friends at the NAB 
20101221142726.576|20101221142728.081|TR0|talked to Senator DeMint, 
20101221142728.081|20101221142729.585|TR0|Senator Coburn, Sessions of 
20101221142729.585|20101221142731.090|TR0|Alabama, both senators from 
20101221142731.090|20101221142732.595|TR0|Wyoming, Cornyn of Texas. But 
20101221142732.595|20101221142734.099|TR0|every single time those senators 
20101221142734.099|20101221142735.604|TR0|heard from local people, from, 
20101221142735.604|20101221142737.109|TR0|you know, local community 
20101221142737.109|20101221142738.613|TR0|leaders to the Red Cross, they 
20101221142738.613|20101221142740.118|TR0|would say, "Wait, people want 
20101221142740.118|20101221142741.623|TR0|this," and they'd call up the 
20101221142741.623|20101221142743.128|TR0|NAB and say, "We're dropping 
20101221142743.128|20101221142744.632|TR0|that hold." This is a grassroots 
20101221142744.632|20101221142746.137|TR0|victory for media reform and for 
20101221142746.137|20101221142747.642|TR0|community organizing everywhere.

20101221142752.156|20101221142753.660|TR0|with us. Apparently NAB now says 
20101221142753.660|20101221142755.165|TR0|they're going to throw a party 
20101221142755.165|20101221142756.670|TR0|for the low community radio 
20101221142756.670|20101221142758.174|TR0|activists?

20101221142801.184|20101221142802.689|TR0|want to gather us all together. 
20101221142802.689|20101221142804.193|TR0|It was - the thing is, Amy, is 
20101221142804.193|20101221142805.698|TR0|that when you look at radio, I 
20101221142805.698|20101221142807.203|TR0|think that the NAB thinks about 
20101221142807.203|20101221142808.707|TR0|everything from iPods to, you 
20101221142808.707|20101221142810.212|TR0|know, a Bluetooth, and they're 
20101221142810.212|20101221142811.717|TR0|like, "Wait, free and local 
20101221142811.717|20101221142813.221|TR0|broadcasting - are we going to 
20101221142813.221|20101221142814.726|TR0|die? Are we on the outs?" When, 
20101221142814.726|20101221142816.231|TR0|if they sat down and thought 
20101221142816.231|20101221142817.736|TR0|about it, they could look at new 
20101221142817.736|20101221142819.240|TR0|Low Power radio stations and

20101221142905.886|20101221142907.391|TR0|Treaty, or New START, calls for

20101221142908.895|20101221142910.400|TR0|cut their deployed arsenals to

20101221142913.409|20101221142914.914|TR0|Republicans have stalled the 
20101221142914.914|20101221142916.419|TR0|proposal since it was reached 
20101221142916.419|20101221142917.923|TR0|earlier this year, in a bid to 
20101221142917.923|20101221142919.428|TR0|seek more nuclear funding and 
20101221142919.428|20101221142920.933|TR0|maintain support for the

20101221142922.437|20101221142923.942|TR0|program. But with Congress

20101221142925.447|20101221142926.952|TR0|year, Democrats say they've 
20101221142926.952|20101221142928.456|TR0|earned enough Republican support 
20101221142928.456|20101221142929.961|TR0|to ensure Senate passage.

20101221142941.999|20101221142943.503|TR0|this is a treaty that has - that 
20101221142943.503|20101221142945.008|TR0|was negotiated over the course 
20101221142945.008|20101221142946.513|TR0|of many months, signed in April

20101221142952.531|20101221142954.036|TR0|floor exceeds the time of debate

20101221143013.597|20101221143015.102|TR0|should not be decided under the 
20101221143015.102|20101221143016.607|TR0|pressure of a deadline. The 
20101221143016.607|20101221143018.111|TR0|American people don't want us to 
20101221143018.111|20101221143019.616|TR0|squeeze our most important work 
20101221143019.616|20101221143021.121|TR0|into the final days of a 
20101221143021.121|20101221143022.625|TR0|session; they want us to take

20101221143030.149|20101221143031.653|TR0|led calls to delay the vote

20101221143043.691|20101221143045.196|TR0|people voted for us to stop the 
20101221143045.196|20101221143046.700|TR0|politics. They voted for us to 
20101221143046.700|20101221143048.205|TR0|act like adults and do the 
20101221143048.205|20101221143049.710|TR0|business of this country. And I 
20101221143049.710|20101221143051.215|TR0|believe voting on this treaty in 
20101221143051.215|20101221143052.719|TR0|these next hours and days is our 
20101221143052.719|20101221143054.224|TR0|opportunity to live up to the

20101221143118.299|20101221143119.804|TR0|Jonathan Schell. Explain what 
20101221143119.804|20101221143121.308|TR0|this New START treaty is.
20101221143121.308|20101221143122.813|TR0|
20101221143122.813|20101221143124.318|TR0|>> JONATHAN SCHELL: Well, it's 
20101221143124.318|20101221143125.823|TR0|sort of garden-variety, 
20101221143125.823|20101221143127.327|TR0|moderate, sensible, minimal arms 
20101221143127.327|20101221143128.832|TR0|control. I think of it as arms 
20101221143128.832|20101221143130.337|TR0|control maintenance. It does 
20101221143130.337|20101221143131.841|TR0|basically two things that have 
20101221143131.841|20101221143133.346|TR0|been going on for the last 30 
20101221143133.346|20101221143134.851|TR0|years or 40 years, really since 
20101221143134.851|20101221143136.355|TR0|Richard Nixon inaugurated arms 
20101221143136.355|20101221143137.860|TR0|control in 1972. And that is, it 
20101221143137.860|20101221143139.365|TR0|shaves the arsenals a little 
20101221143139.365|20101221143140.870|TR0|bit, a couple of hundred 
20101221143140.870|20101221143142.374|TR0|warheads, also reduces the 
20101221143142.374|20101221143143.879|TR0|number of delivery vehicles that 
20101221143143.879|20101221143145.384|TR0|are allowed. And maybe more 
20101221143145.384|20101221143146.888|TR0|important than that, it 
20101221143146.888|20101221143148.393|TR0|reintroduces inspections, which 
20101221143148.393|20101221143149.898|TR0|have lapsed with the lapse of 
20101221143149.898|20101221143151.402|TR0|the START treaty, the old START 
20101221143151.402|20101221143152.907|TR0|treaty. So this is what's been 
20101221143152.907|20101221143154.412|TR0|going on for 40 years in arms 
20101221143154.412|20101221143155.916|TR0|control, and it pushes it along 
20101221143155.916|20101221143157.421|TR0|in a kind of minimal way. It's a 
20101221143157.421|20101221143158.926|TR0|little bit like paying the 
20101221143158.926|20101221143200.431|TR0|mortgage on your house. You 
20101221143200.431|20101221143201.935|TR0|know, if you pay your mortgage, 
20101221143201.935|20101221143203.440|TR0|it's not a big deal. But if you 
20101221143203.440|20101221143204.945|TR0|don't, the consequences could be 
20101221143204.945|20101221143206.449|TR0|pretty dire. And that's pretty 
20101221143206.449|20101221143207.954|TR0|much the way I look at this.

20101221143213.973|20101221143215.478|TR0|>> JONATHAN SCHELL: Well, the 
20101221143215.478|20101221143216.982|TR0|consequences of not passing the 
20101221143216.982|20101221143218.487|TR0|treaty really would reverberate 
20101221143218.487|20101221143219.992|TR0|throughout the entire nuclear 
20101221143219.992|20101221143221.496|TR0|regime. And by "nuclear regime," 
20101221143221.496|20101221143223.001|TR0|I mean the Nuclear 
20101221143223.001|20101221143224.506|TR0|Non-Proliferation Treaty, I mean 
20101221143224.506|20101221143226.010|TR0|various disarmament efforts 
20101221143226.010|20101221143227.515|TR0|around the world, because those 
20101221143227.515|20101221143229.020|TR0|things are really intimately 
20101221143229.020|20101221143230.524|TR0|linked. It's like one net. It's 
20101221143230.524|20101221143232.029|TR0|like one web. And you pull one 
20101221143232.029|20101221143233.534|TR0|strand, and it has an effect 
20101221143233.534|20101221143235.039|TR0|over on the other side. And in 
20101221143235.039|20101221143236.543|TR0|this case, it would really pull 
20101221143236.543|20101221143238.048|TR0|the linchpin out of that system, 
20101221143238.048|20101221143239.553|TR0|because if the U.S. and Russia 
20101221143239.553|20101221143241.057|TR0|renege on their obligations 
20101221143241.057|20101221143242.562|TR0|under the Nuclear 
20101221143242.562|20101221143244.067|TR0|Non-Proliferation Treaty to 
20101221143244.067|20101221143245.571|TR0|proceed with disarmament, it 
20101221143245.571|20101221143247.076|TR0|sends a signal out to the rest 
20101221143247.076|20101221143248.581|TR0|of the world that we're going to 
20101221143248.581|20101221143250.086|TR0|be living in a nuclear-armed 
20101221143250.086|20101221143251.590|TR0|world, and proliferation begins 
20101221143251.590|20101221143253.095|TR0|to step up. It really undercuts 
20101221143253.095|20101221143254.600|TR0|nonproliferation efforts across 
20101221143254.600|20101221143256.104|TR0|the world.

20101221143257.609|20101221143259.114|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Explain why the 
20101221143259.114|20101221143300.618|TR0|Republicans are opposed to this.
20101221143300.618|20101221143302.123|TR0|
20101221143302.123|20101221143303.628|TR0|>> JONATHAN SCHELL: You know, 
20101221143303.628|20101221143305.132|TR0|one reason obviously is 
20101221143305.132|20101221143306.637|TR0|politics. We've heard from Mitch 
20101221143306.637|20101221143308.142|TR0|McConnell that the most 
20101221143308.142|20101221143309.647|TR0|important thing for him is 
20101221143309.647|20101221143311.151|TR0|defeating Obama in the next 
20101221143311.151|20101221143312.656|TR0|presidential election. So that's 
20101221143312.656|20101221143314.161|TR0|from his own mouth. But I think 
20101221143314.161|20101221143315.665|TR0|that they - traditionally, 
20101221143315.665|20101221143317.170|TR0|they're sort of - stock and 
20101221143317.170|20101221143318.675|TR0|trade, has been accusing 
20101221143318.675|20101221143320.179|TR0|Democrats of weakness on this or 
20101221143320.179|20101221143321.684|TR0|that. And I think that they hope 
20101221143321.684|20101221143323.189|TR0|to make political hay in that 
20101221143323.189|20101221143324.694|TR0|way. And also, very simply and 
20101221143324.694|20101221143326.198|TR0|tactically, they will have more 
20101221143326.198|20101221143327.703|TR0|Republican senators when the new 
20101221143327.703|20101221143329.208|TR0|Senate convenes next year. And I 
20101221143329.208|20101221143330.712|TR0|think they might hope to 
20101221143330.712|20101221143332.217|TR0|actually stop the - have a 
20101221143332.217|20101221143333.722|TR0|better chance of stopping the 
20101221143333.722|20101221143335.226|TR0|treaty altogether for those 
20101221143335.226|20101221143336.731|TR0|reasons, or else to demand a 
20101221143336.731|20101221143338.236|TR0|higher price for passing it. 
20101221143338.236|20101221143339.740|TR0|Already, the price for passing 
20101221143339.740|20101221143341.245|TR0|that they've exacted has been 
20101221143341.245|20101221143342.750|TR0|very high.
20101221143342.750|20101221143344.255|TR0|
20101221143344.255|20101221143345.759|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you step 
20101221143345.759|20101221143347.264|TR0|back and explain why we have the 
20101221143347.264|20101221143348.769|TR0|same relationship with Russia 
20101221143348.769|20101221143350.273|TR0|that we've had for decades? 
20101221143350.273|20101221143351.778|TR0|Explain what it is and what 
20101221143351.778|20101221143353.283|TR0|you'd like to see.
20101221143353.283|20101221143354.787|TR0|
20101221143354.787|20101221143356.292|TR0|>> JONATHAN SCHELL: Well, this 
20101221143356.292|20101221143357.797|TR0|is really the deeper question, 
20101221143357.797|20101221143359.302|TR0|because here we are - you know, 
20101221143359.302|20101221143400.806|TR0|it's 1989, 1991, the Cold War 
20101221143400.806|20101221143402.311|TR0|ends. Let's remember why these 
20101221143402.311|20101221143403.816|TR0|arsenals were built. They were 
20101221143403.816|20101221143405.320|TR0|built for Cold War purposes. And 
20101221143405.320|20101221143406.825|TR0|when the Cold War ended, their 
20101221143406.825|20101221143408.330|TR0|raison d'etre, their political 
20101221143408.330|20101221143409.834|TR0|raison d'etre, really 
20101221143409.834|20101221143411.339|TR0|disappeared. And so, in a 
20101221143411.339|20101221143412.844|TR0|certain sense, it's really 
20101221143412.844|20101221143414.348|TR0|fantastical that the United 
20101221143414.348|20101221143415.853|TR0|States and Russia are still 
20101221143415.853|20101221143417.358|TR0|aiming 1,550 or 2,000 strategic 
20101221143417.358|20101221143418.863|TR0|warheads at one another. What is 
20101221143418.863|20101221143420.367|TR0|that all about politically? It 
20101221143420.367|20101221143421.872|TR0|really defies rational 
20101221143421.872|20101221143423.377|TR0|explanation. And so, what you 
20101221143423.377|20101221143424.881|TR0|really have to ask yourself is 
20101221143424.881|20101221143426.386|TR0|why is it, so long after the end 
20101221143426.386|20101221143427.891|TR0|of the Cold War, that the 
20101221143427.891|20101221143429.395|TR0|momentum or inertia, or whatever 
20101221143429.395|20101221143430.900|TR0|you want to call it, of this 
20101221143430.900|20101221143432.405|TR0|nuclear standoff, this mutual 
20101221143432.405|20101221143433.910|TR0|assured destruction 
20101221143433.910|20101221143435.414|TR0|relationship, persists and we 
20101221143435.414|20101221143436.919|TR0|can't really unravel it in a 
20101221143436.919|20101221143438.424|TR0|more radical way?
20101221143438.424|20101221143439.928|TR0|
20101221143439.928|20101221143441.433|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What do weapons 
20101221143441.433|20101221143442.938|TR0|manufacturers have to do with 
20101221143442.938|20101221143444.442|TR0|this?
20101221143444.442|20101221143445.947|TR0|
20101221143445.947|20101221143447.452|TR0|>> JONATHAN SCHELL: Well, 
20101221143447.452|20101221143448.957|TR0|obviously, their interests are 
20101221143448.957|20101221143450.461|TR0|very, very great. And when you - 
20101221143450.461|20101221143451.966|TR0|when their money is threatened, 
20101221143451.966|20101221143453.471|TR0|they push back. And so, it's an 
20101221143453.471|20101221143454.975|TR0|important factor. But I think it 
20101221143454.975|20101221143456.480|TR0|maybe not be the most important 
20101221143456.480|20101221143457.985|TR0|factor here.
20101221143457.985|20101221143459.489|TR0|
20101221143459.489|20101221143500.994|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you 
20101221143500.994|20101221143502.499|TR0|this. One of the releases in 
20101221143502.499|20101221143504.003|TR0|WikiLeaks, a senior government 
20101221143504.003|20101221143505.508|TR0|official in Yemen warned U.S. 
20101221143505.508|20101221143507.013|TR0|diplomats that poor security at 
20101221143507.013|20101221143508.518|TR0|the country's main store of 
20101221143508.518|20101221143510.022|TR0|radioactive products could allow 
20101221143510.022|20101221143511.527|TR0|dangerous material to fall into 
20101221143511.527|20101221143513.032|TR0|the hands of terrorists, 
20101221143513.032|20101221143514.536|TR0|according to a leaked U.S. 
20101221143514.536|20101221143516.041|TR0|embassy cable. The official told 
20101221143516.041|20101221143517.546|TR0|the Americans that the lone 
20101221143517.546|20101221143519.050|TR0|guard standing watch at Yemen's

20101221143526.574|20101221143528.079|TR0|down six months previously and 
20101221143528.079|20101221143529.583|TR0|was never fixed.

20101221143531.088|20101221143532.593|TR0|>> JONATHAN SCHELL: Well, what 
20101221143532.593|20101221143534.097|TR0|this shows you is that we're 
20101221143534.097|20101221143535.602|TR0|approaching really a new point 
20101221143535.602|20101221143537.107|TR0|in the whole evolution of the 
20101221143537.107|20101221143538.611|TR0|nuclear age, and that is the 
20101221143538.611|20101221143540.116|TR0|point at which nuclear weapon 
20101221143540.116|20101221143541.621|TR0|materials escape from the 
20101221143541.621|20101221143543.126|TR0|control merely of states and get 
20101221143543.126|20101221143544.630|TR0|down to sub-state groups, 
20101221143544.630|20101221143546.135|TR0|including, of course, 
20101221143546.135|20101221143547.640|TR0|conceivably terrorist groups. 
20101221143547.640|20101221143549.144|TR0|It's impossible to know when 
20101221143549.144|20101221143550.649|TR0|that line will be crossed, 
20101221143550.649|20101221143552.154|TR0|because almost by definition, 
20101221143552.154|20101221143553.658|TR0|that's going to happen in 
20101221143553.658|20101221143555.163|TR0|secrecy somewhere. Some deal is 
20101221143555.163|20101221143556.668|TR0|going to go down in Azerbaijan 
20101221143556.668|20101221143558.173|TR0|or somewhere else, and that line 
20101221143558.173|20101221143559.677|TR0|will be crossed. We've been 
20101221143559.677|20101221143601.182|TR0|approaching it really for 60 
20101221143601.182|20101221143602.687|TR0|years, because it's just in the 
20101221143602.687|20101221143604.191|TR0|very nature of this technology 
20101221143604.191|20101221143605.696|TR0|that it spreads.

20101221143611.715|20101221143613.219|TR0|>> JONATHAN SCHELL: The best way 
20101221143613.219|20101221143614.724|TR0|to deal with that is to roll 
20101221143614.724|20101221143616.229|TR0|back the technology as a whole. 
20101221143616.229|20101221143617.734|TR0|And that's really where Obama's 
20101221143617.734|20101221143619.238|TR0|commitment to move to a world 
20101221143619.238|20101221143620.743|TR0|free of nuclear weapons comes 
20101221143620.743|20101221143622.248|TR0|in, because the very same steps 
20101221143622.248|20101221143623.752|TR0|that you would take to actually 
20101221143623.752|20101221143625.257|TR0|eliminate nuclear weapons are 
20101221143625.257|20101221143626.762|TR0|the very ones that you would 
20101221143626.762|20101221143628.266|TR0|take to keep that technology 
20101221143628.266|20101221143629.771|TR0|from spreading into other hands. 
20101221143629.771|20101221143631.276|TR0|In other words, you'd get it 
20101221143631.276|20101221143632.781|TR0|under control, you would 
20101221143632.781|20101221143634.285|TR0|actually liquidate it so it 
20101221143634.285|20101221143635.790|TR0|didn't exist. That would be an 
20101221143635.790|20101221143637.295|TR0|important step. And then you - 
20101221143637.295|20101221143638.799|TR0|so you'd solve really the two 
20101221143638.799|20101221143640.304|TR0|problems with one stroke.

20101221143643.313|20101221143644.818|TR0|I want to thank you very much 
20101221143644.818|20101221143646.323|TR0|for being with us, leading

20101221143658.360|20101221143659.865|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to 
20101221143659.865|20101221143701.370|TR0|part two of the debate over the 
20101221143701.370|20101221143702.874|TR0|sex crime allegations against 
20101221143702.874|20101221143704.379|TR0|WikiLeaks founder Julian 
20101221143704.379|20101221143705.884|TR0|Assange. Freed on bail in 
20101221143705.884|20101221143707.389|TR0|London, Assange hasn't been 
20101221143707.389|20101221143708.893|TR0|charged, but he is wanted in 
20101221143708.893|20101221143710.398|TR0|Sweden for questioning on sex 
20101221143710.398|20101221143711.903|TR0|crimes allegations.
20101221143711.903|20101221143713.407|TR0|
20101221143713.407|20101221143714.912|TR0|Assange and his supporters have 
20101221143714.912|20101221143716.417|TR0|said the case is part of a wider 
20101221143716.417|20101221143717.921|TR0|conspiracy to discredit him 
20101221143717.921|20101221143719.426|TR0|because of his work with 
20101221143719.426|20101221143720.931|TR0|WikiLeaks. But that argument has 
20101221143720.931|20101221143722.435|TR0|been criticized by some in the 
20101221143722.435|20101221143723.940|TR0|feminist community who have 
20101221143723.940|20101221143725.445|TR0|accused WikiLeaks supporters of 
20101221143725.445|20101221143726.950|TR0|minimizing violence against 
20101221143726.950|20101221143728.454|TR0|women.

20101221143729.959|20101221143731.464|TR0|Well, yesterday on Democracy 
20101221143731.464|20101221143732.968|TR0|Now!, we were joined by two 
20101221143732.968|20101221143734.473|TR0|guests: Jaclyn Friedman, 
20101221143734.473|20101221143735.978|TR0|executive director of Women, 
20101221143735.978|20101221143737.482|TR0|Action, & the Media and editor 
20101221143737.482|20101221143738.987|TR0|of the anthology Yes Means Yes:

20101221143741.997|20101221143743.501|TR0|Naomi Wolf, a social critic, 
20101221143743.501|20101221143745.006|TR0|author of seven books, including 
20101221143745.006|20101221143746.511|TR0|The Beauty Myth and The End of

20101221143749.520|20101221143751.025|TR0|Today, we go to part two of 
20101221143751.025|20101221143752.529|TR0|their debate. After we ended the 
20101221143752.529|20101221143754.034|TR0|live broadcast, Jaclyn Friedman 
20101221143754.034|20101221143755.539|TR0|talked about her definition of 
20101221143755.539|20101221143757.044|TR0|"consent."
20101221143757.044|20101221143758.548|TR0|
20101221143758.548|20101221143800.053|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: My book, Yes 
20101221143800.053|20101221143801.558|TR0|Means Yes, proposes a new model 
20101221143801.558|20101221143803.062|TR0|of consent, and it works like 
20101221143803.062|20101221143804.567|TR0|this. It is the responsibility 
20101221143804.567|20101221143806.072|TR0|of every party to a sexual 
20101221143806.072|20101221143807.576|TR0|encounter to not just make sure 
20101221143807.576|20101221143809.081|TR0|that someone is not lying there 
20101221143809.081|20101221143810.586|TR0|terrified of them, not 
20101221143810.586|20101221143812.090|TR0|objecting, but to actively make 
20101221143812.090|20101221143813.595|TR0|sure they're consenting. And 
20101221143813.595|20101221143815.100|TR0|this is a model that's being 
20101221143815.100|20101221143816.605|TR0|increasingly adopted, because it 
20101221143816.605|20101221143818.109|TR0|puts everybody in the driver's 
20101221143818.109|20101221143819.614|TR0|seat. Everybody who's 
20101221143819.614|20101221143821.119|TR0|participating with somebody else 
20101221143821.119|20101221143822.623|TR0|sexually has a responsibility to 
20101221143822.623|20101221143824.128|TR0|make sure that their partner is 
20101221143824.128|20101221143825.633|TR0|enthusiastic with what's 
20101221143825.633|20101221143827.137|TR0|happening. I mean, really, in a 
20101221143827.137|20101221143828.642|TR0|practical sense, would you want 
20101221143828.642|20101221143830.147|TR0|to have sex with someone who is 
20101221143830.147|20101221143831.652|TR0|not enthusiastic? None of us 
20101221143831.652|20101221143833.156|TR0|would, I think, if we're not 
20101221143833.156|20101221143834.661|TR0|sexual predators.
20101221143834.661|20101221143836.166|TR0|
20101221143836.166|20101221143837.670|TR0|And so, when we talk about 
20101221143837.670|20101221143839.175|TR0|consent and we talk about 
20101221143839.175|20101221143840.680|TR0|whether or not she literally 
20101221143840.680|20101221143842.184|TR0|said the word "no," we have to 
20101221143842.184|20101221143843.689|TR0|talk about the context. He had 
20101221143843.689|20101221143845.194|TR0|ripped her necklace. He had held 
20101221143845.194|20101221143846.698|TR0|her down. She was afraid. A lot 
20101221143846.698|20101221143848.203|TR0|of women have been taught that 
20101221143848.203|20101221143849.708|TR0|they can do nothing against 
20101221143849.708|20101221143851.213|TR0|someone who wants to rape them, 
20101221143851.213|20101221143852.717|TR0|and the best thing to do is to 
20101221143852.717|20101221143854.222|TR0|go along so they don't get 
20101221143854.222|20101221143855.727|TR0|further hurt. And a lot of women 
20101221143855.727|20101221143857.231|TR0|operate with that fear. Further, 
20101221143857.231|20101221143858.736|TR0|if we look at the second case, 
20101221143858.736|20101221143900.241|TR0|she was asleep. A woman who is 
20101221143900.241|20101221143901.745|TR0|asleep, a person who is 
20101221143901.745|20101221143903.250|TR0|unconscious, is unable to 
20101221143903.250|20101221143904.755|TR0|consent. They're also unable to 
20101221143904.755|20101221143906.260|TR0|object. So if you initiate sex 
20101221143906.260|20101221143907.764|TR0|with a sleeping person, you are 
20101221143907.764|20101221143909.269|TR0|sexually assaulting them, and 
20101221143909.269|20101221143910.774|TR0|that is perfectly clear.
20101221143910.774|20101221143912.278|TR0|
20101221143912.278|20101221143913.783|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: I, too, worry 
20101221143913.783|20101221143915.288|TR0|about the fact that rape is so 
20101221143915.288|20101221143916.792|TR0|rarely taken seriously and that 
20101221143916.792|20101221143918.297|TR0|victims of very cut-and-dry 
20101221143918.297|20101221143919.802|TR0|crimes have very little chance 
20101221143919.802|20101221143921.306|TR0|of any kind of legal hearing 
20101221143921.306|20101221143922.811|TR0|around the world, including in 
20101221143922.811|20101221143924.316|TR0|the West, including in 
20101221143924.316|20101221143925.821|TR0|Scandinavia. But I would say 
20101221143925.821|20101221143927.325|TR0|that it's exactly this kind of 
20101221143927.325|20101221143928.830|TR0|treatment of this kind of 
20101221143928.830|20101221143930.335|TR0|situation that undermines the 
20101221143930.335|20101221143931.839|TR0|seriousness with which rape 
20101221143931.839|20101221143933.344|TR0|victims are likely to get a 
20101221143933.344|20101221143934.849|TR0|response. If you look  --  
20101221143934.849|20101221143936.353|TR0|again, Jaclyn, I urge you to 
20101221143936.353|20101221143937.858|TR0|look at this report from the 
20101221143937.858|20101221143939.363|TR0|police. Again and again and 
20101221143939.363|20101221143940.868|TR0|again  --
20101221143940.868|20101221143942.372|TR0|
20101221143942.372|20101221143943.877|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: I fully have.
20101221143943.877|20101221143945.382|TR0|
20101221143945.382|20101221143946.886|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: Can I just 
20101221143946.886|20101221143948.391|TR0|finish? Thank you.
20101221143948.391|20101221143949.896|TR0|
20101221143949.896|20101221143951.400|TR0|Again and again and again, 
20101221143951.400|20101221143952.905|TR0|Assange did what Jaclyn and 
20101221143952.905|20101221143954.410|TR0|everyone who cares about rape 
20101221143954.410|20101221143955.914|TR0|and I say you should do: he 
20101221143955.914|20101221143957.419|TR0|consulted with the women. Now, 
20101221143957.419|20101221143958.924|TR0|if you're going to say that, you 
20101221143958.924|20101221144000.429|TR0|know, anyone who takes someone's 
20101221144000.429|20101221144001.933|TR0|clothes off, you know, in an 
20101221144001.933|20101221144003.438|TR0|assertive way is engaging in a 
20101221144003.438|20101221144004.943|TR0|sex crime, then a lot of people 
20101221144004.943|20101221144006.447|TR0|who are having consensual sex 
20101221144006.447|20101221144007.952|TR0|are going to be criminalized. 
20101221144007.952|20101221144009.457|TR0|But the point is, he stopped 
20101221144009.457|20101221144010.961|TR0|when the women said, "Let's talk 
20101221144010.961|20101221144012.466|TR0|about the condom." He discussed 
20101221144012.466|20101221144013.971|TR0|it. They reached an agreement, 
20101221144013.971|20101221144015.476|TR0|and they went ahead. He didn't 
20101221144015.476|20101221144016.980|TR0|have sex with that woman when 
20101221144016.980|20101221144018.485|TR0|she was asleep. I agree that you 
20101221144018.485|20101221144019.990|TR0|need to be awake and conscious 
20101221144019.990|20101221144021.494|TR0|and not drunk to consent. We 
20101221144021.494|20101221144022.999|TR0|agree about that.
20101221144022.999|20101221144024.504|TR0|
20101221144024.504|20101221144026.008|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: He did have 
20101221144026.008|20101221144027.513|TR0|- that's the allegation, is that 
20101221144027.513|20101221144029.018|TR0|he started when she was asleep.
20101221144029.018|20101221144030.522|TR0|
20101221144030.522|20101221144032.027|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: Can you just bear 
20101221144032.027|20101221144033.532|TR0|with me?
20101221144033.532|20101221144035.037|TR0|
20101221144035.037|20101221144036.541|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: That is the 
20101221144036.541|20101221144038.046|TR0|allegation.
20101221144038.046|20101221144039.551|TR0|
20101221144039.551|20101221144041.055|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: Well, you know, 
20101221144041.055|20101221144042.560|TR0|he started to have sex with her 
20101221144042.560|20101221144044.065|TR0|when she was asleep, correct. 
20101221144044.065|20101221144045.569|TR0|And she said in her -
20101221144045.569|20101221144047.074|TR0|
20101221144047.074|20101221144048.579|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: And that's 
20101221144048.579|20101221144050.084|TR0|rape.
20101221144050.084|20101221144051.588|TR0|
20101221144051.588|20101221144053.093|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: Just bear with me 
20101221144053.093|20101221144054.598|TR0| --  that she was half asleep. 
20101221144054.598|20101221144056.102|TR0|Then she woke up. Then they 
20101221144056.102|20101221144057.607|TR0|discussed how they would have 
20101221144057.607|20101221144059.112|TR0|sex, under what conditions, 
20101221144059.112|20101221144100.616|TR0|which is, to me, negotiating 
20101221144100.616|20101221144102.121|TR0|consent. Your model is not a new 
20101221144102.121|20101221144103.626|TR0|one, with all due respect. I 
20101221144103.626|20101221144105.131|TR0|agree that people need to be 
20101221144105.131|20101221144106.635|TR0|clear about consent, be clear 
20101221144106.635|20101221144108.140|TR0|about the circumstances. Then 
20101221144108.140|20101221144109.645|TR0|they had a negotiation in which 
20101221144109.645|20101221144111.149|TR0|they both agreed not to use a 
20101221144111.149|20101221144112.654|TR0|condom. And then he went ahead, 
20101221144112.654|20101221144114.159|TR0|and they made love. And what I'm 
20101221144114.159|20101221144115.663|TR0|trying to say  --
20101221144115.663|20101221144117.168|TR0|
20101221144117.168|20101221144118.673|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: She 
20101221144118.673|20101221144120.177|TR0|negotiated - they did not make 
20101221144120.177|20101221144121.682|TR0|love.
20101221144121.682|20101221144123.187|TR0|
20101221144123.187|20101221144124.692|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: Well, I guess you 
20101221144124.692|20101221144126.196|TR0|- neither you nor I were there. 
20101221144126.196|20101221144127.701|TR0|And it seems to me that when you 
20101221144127.701|20101221144129.206|TR0|say, "OK, you better not have 
20101221144129.206|20101221144130.710|TR0|HIV," he said, "Of course not." 
20101221144130.710|20101221144132.215|TR0|Quote, "She couldn't be bothered 
20101221144132.215|20101221144133.720|TR0|to tell him one more time 
20101221144133.720|20101221144135.224|TR0|because she had been going on 
20101221144135.224|20101221144136.729|TR0|about the condom all night." To 
20101221144136.729|20101221144138.234|TR0|me, that - I mean, if I was 
20101221144138.234|20101221144139.739|TR0|making love with a woman, if I 
20101221144139.739|20101221144141.243|TR0|was - you know, if I was a 
20101221144141.243|20101221144142.748|TR0|lesbian making love with a woman 
20101221144142.748|20101221144144.253|TR0|and we had that conversation, I 
20101221144144.253|20101221144145.757|TR0|would keep making love with her, 
20101221144145.757|20101221144147.262|TR0|because we had had a discussion 
20101221144147.262|20101221144148.767|TR0|about it and reached a 
20101221144148.767|20101221144150.271|TR0|conclusion.
20101221144150.271|20101221144151.776|TR0|
20101221144151.776|20101221144153.281|TR0|All I'm saying is I think that 
20101221144153.281|20101221144154.785|TR0|this - again, never in 23 years 
20101221144154.785|20101221144156.290|TR0|of supporting rape victims - 
20101221144156.290|20101221144157.795|TR0|rape victims, people who had no 
20101221144157.795|20101221144159.300|TR0|ambiguity, who didn't throw 
20101221144159.300|20101221144200.804|TR0|parties for their rapist four 
20101221144200.804|20101221144202.309|TR0|days later, who didn't continue 
20101221144202.309|20101221144203.814|TR0|to host - I mean, women who have 
20101221144203.814|20101221144205.318|TR0|been raped, in my experience, 
20101221144205.318|20101221144206.823|TR0|don't want to be around their 
20101221144206.823|20101221144208.328|TR0|rapist. They don't host them in 
20101221144208.328|20101221144209.832|TR0|their home. They can barely go 
20101221144209.832|20101221144211.337|TR0|home if there's been an assault 
20101221144211.337|20101221144212.842|TR0|in their home.

20101221144214.347|20101221144215.851|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: I find it 
20101221144215.851|20101221144217.356|TR0|surprising, then, that you've 
20101221144217.356|20101221144218.861|TR0|been around many women who have 
20101221144218.861|20101221144220.365|TR0|been raped, because the women I 
20101221144220.365|20101221144221.870|TR0|talk to who have been raped - 70 
20101221144221.870|20101221144223.375|TR0|to 80 percent of all sexual 
20101221144223.375|20101221144224.879|TR0|assaults are committed by people 
20101221144224.879|20101221144226.384|TR0|who know their assailant.
20101221144226.384|20101221144227.889|TR0|
20101221144227.889|20101221144229.393|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: Of course that's

20101221144233.908|20101221144235.412|TR0|a lot of - OK, I'm talking now. 
20101221144235.412|20101221144236.917|TR0|That creates a lot of difficulty 
20101221144236.917|20101221144238.422|TR0|in terms of complex feelings 
20101221144238.422|20101221144239.926|TR0|afterwards, the ability for the 
20101221144239.926|20101221144241.431|TR0|rapist to emotionally manipulate 
20101221144241.431|20101221144242.936|TR0|them, and people - like you are 
20101221144242.936|20101221144244.440|TR0|doing - minimizing their 
20101221144244.440|20101221144245.945|TR0|experiences.

20101221144307.011|20101221144308.516|TR0|I go to a lot of Take Back the 
20101221144308.516|20101221144310.020|TR0|Night talks on college campuses, 
20101221144310.020|20101221144311.525|TR0|because I'm invited to speak 
20101221144311.525|20101221144313.030|TR0|there. And I hear the same story 
20101221144313.030|20101221144314.534|TR0|over and over again. I hear the 
20101221144314.534|20101221144316.039|TR0|story from women who were 
20101221144316.039|20101221144317.544|TR0|sexually assaulted by someone 
20101221144317.544|20101221144319.048|TR0|they knew, sometimes continued 
20101221144319.048|20101221144320.553|TR0|to date them, sometimes 
20101221144320.553|20101221144322.058|TR0|continued to live with them, 
20101221144322.058|20101221144323.563|TR0|because they didn't know that 
20101221144323.563|20101221144325.067|TR0|they had rights. They didn't 
20101221144325.067|20101221144326.572|TR0|know that what was being done to 
20101221144326.572|20101221144328.077|TR0|them was something that was not 
20101221144328.077|20101221144329.581|TR0|OK and that they could speak up 
20101221144329.581|20101221144331.086|TR0|about. They were afraid. They 
20101221144331.086|20101221144332.591|TR0|were confused. And they don't 
20101221144332.591|20101221144334.095|TR0|tell anybody. And then they get 
20101221144334.095|20101221144335.600|TR0|up at these talks, and they say, 
20101221144335.600|20101221144337.105|TR0|"I didn't tell anybody for three 
20101221144337.105|20101221144338.609|TR0|years. I let this keep going on, 
20101221144338.609|20101221144340.114|TR0|because I didn't know that I had 
20101221144340.114|20101221144341.619|TR0|any better choices. And it's 
20101221144341.619|20101221144343.124|TR0|been making me suffer in silence 
20101221144343.124|20101221144344.628|TR0|for three years, because I 
20101221144344.628|20101221144346.133|TR0|haven't had access to any

20101221144347.638|20101221144349.142|TR0|the story I hear from trauma

20101221144359.675|20101221144401.180|TR0|real rape victims, too, right? 
20101221144401.180|20101221144402.685|TR0|Like, real rape doesn't 
20101221144402.685|20101221144404.189|TR0|necessarily involve  --

20101221144428.264|20101221144429.769|TR0|giving women a home court 
20101221144429.769|20101221144431.274|TR0|advantage; it's about justice.

20101221144816.978|20101221144818.483|TR0|assault - and by the way, these 
20101221144818.483|20101221144819.988|TR0|women did not make charges 
20101221144819.988|20101221144821.492|TR0|against him. They went to the 
20101221144821.492|20101221144822.997|TR0|police to see if they could get 
20101221144822.997|20101221144824.502|TR0|him to take an STD test. The 
20101221144824.502|20101221144826.006|TR0|police, the state brought 
20101221144826.006|20101221144827.511|TR0|charges.

20101221144830.521|20101221144832.025|TR0|for a second. Explain that. We 
20101221144832.025|20101221144833.530|TR0|have talked about that, but -

20101221144835.035|20101221144836.539|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: OK, it is a very 
20101221144836.539|20101221144838.044|TR0|important distinction. And, you 
20101221144838.044|20101221144839.549|TR0|know, when I worked with rape 
20101221144839.549|20101221144841.053|TR0|survivors in the United Kingdom 
20101221144841.053|20101221144842.558|TR0|in the '80s, there was a same 
20101221144842.558|20101221144844.063|TR0|situation where it was the state 
20101221144844.063|20101221144845.567|TR0|and not the women who pursued 
20101221144845.567|20101221144847.072|TR0|the case. And this very much 
20101221144847.072|20101221144848.577|TR0|marginalized what the women 
20101221144848.577|20101221144850.082|TR0|wanted. So, let us remember, the 
20101221144850.082|20101221144851.586|TR0|women didn't go to the police 
20101221144851.586|20101221144853.091|TR0|and say, "This guy assaulted 
20101221144853.091|20101221144854.596|TR0|me," or "This guy violated me," 
20101221144854.596|20101221144856.100|TR0|or "This guy molested me." 
20101221144856.100|20101221144857.605|TR0|That's not what happened. They 
20101221144857.605|20101221144859.110|TR0|went to the police, much 
20101221144859.110|20101221144900.614|TR0|subsequent, and said, "Can we 
20101221144900.614|20101221144902.119|TR0|get him to take an STD test?" 
20101221144902.119|20101221144903.624|TR0|And the police walked them 
20101221144903.624|20101221144905.129|TR0|through what had happened, and 
20101221144905.129|20101221144906.633|TR0|the police said, "That's against 
20101221144906.633|20101221144908.138|TR0|the law."

20101221144914.157|20101221144915.661|TR0|in her sleep. It's not at all 
20101221144915.661|20101221144917.166|TR0|about the condom.

20101221144921.680|20101221144923.185|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: The condom 
20101221144923.185|20101221144924.690|TR0|is an issue, but to make it 
20101221144924.690|20101221144926.194|TR0|about the condom - the issue 
20101221144926.194|20101221144927.699|TR0|here is that we are minimizing 
20101221144927.699|20101221144929.204|TR0|the attempt for two women in

20101221144933.718|20101221144935.222|TR0|correct. Jaclyn, I strongly 
20101221144935.222|20101221144936.727|TR0|object.

20101221144942.746|20101221144944.251|TR0|are not going to have a chance 
20101221144944.251|20101221144945.755|TR0|either.

20101221145100.990|20101221145102.495|TR0|not been cut and dry, because 
20101221145102.495|20101221145104.000|TR0|you know what most women hear 
20101221145104.000|20101221145105.504|TR0|when they allege rape? They 
20101221145105.504|20101221145107.009|TR0|hear, "Oh, well, it's ambiguous.

20101221145111.523|20101221145113.028|TR0|reason rape is not reported and

20101221145217.730|20101221145219.234|TR0|ambiguous like she was drinking 
20101221145219.234|20101221145220.739|TR0|too much. I mean ambiguous like 
20101221145220.739|20101221145222.244|TR0|she consented and consented and 
20101221145222.244|20101221145223.748|TR0|consented. That is a big 
20101221145223.748|20101221145225.253|TR0|difference. I, too, support

20101221145229.767|20101221145231.272|TR0|what happened here!

20101221145237.291|20101221145238.795|TR0|Naomi, let me interrupt for one 
20101221145238.795|20101221145240.300|TR0|second and say, what would you 
20101221145240.300|20101221145241.805|TR0|like to see happen at this point 
20101221145241.805|20101221145243.309|TR0|in this case? So, you have 
20101221145243.309|20101221145244.814|TR0|Julian Assange who was held for 
20101221145244.814|20101221145246.319|TR0|a week in jail on allegations of 
20101221145246.319|20101221145247.824|TR0|sexual assault. He has been 
20101221145247.824|20101221145249.328|TR0|released. What do you want to 
20101221145249.328|20101221145250.833|TR0|see happen right now? What do 
20101221145250.833|20101221145252.338|TR0|you each think would be fair? He 
20101221145252.338|20101221145253.842|TR0|faces an extradition hearing on 
20101221145253.842|20101221145255.347|TR0|December 11th, extradition - on 
20101221145255.347|20101221145256.852|TR0|January 11th, extradition to 
20101221145256.852|20101221145258.356|TR0|Sweden. Jaclyn, let's begin with 
20101221145258.356|20101221145259.861|TR0|you. What do you want to see 
20101221145259.861|20101221145301.366|TR0|happen now?
20101221145301.366|20101221145302.870|TR0|
20101221145302.870|20101221145304.375|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: I am mostly 
20101221145304.375|20101221145305.880|TR0|concerned that he faces the 
20101221145305.880|20101221145307.385|TR0|allegations. It does not concern 
20101221145307.385|20101221145308.889|TR0|me. I agree that extradition is 
20101221145308.889|20101221145310.394|TR0|extreme in a case like this. It 
20101221145310.394|20101221145311.899|TR0|certainly is not typical. On the 
20101221145311.899|20101221145313.403|TR0|other hand, he agreed to come 
20101221145313.403|20101221145314.908|TR0|back and volunteer for 
20101221145314.908|20101221145316.413|TR0|questioning in October and did 
20101221145316.413|20101221145317.917|TR0|not do so. But if the British 
20101221145317.917|20101221145319.422|TR0|wanted to insist that the Swedes 
20101221145319.422|20101221145320.927|TR0|go to Britain and interview him 
20101221145320.927|20101221145322.432|TR0|there and have him proceed with 
20101221145322.432|20101221145323.936|TR0|a prosecution there until they 
20101221145323.936|20101221145325.441|TR0|decide whether or not they want 
20101221145325.441|20101221145326.946|TR0|to bring formal charges, I think 
20101221145326.946|20101221145328.450|TR0|that would be perfectly 
20101221145328.450|20101221145329.955|TR0|reasonable. My concern is that 
20101221145329.955|20101221145331.460|TR0|these allegations are taken 
20101221145331.460|20101221145332.964|TR0|seriously, not minimized, 
20101221145332.964|20101221145334.469|TR0|treated as real, because they 
20101221145334.469|20101221145335.974|TR0|represent the real experiences 
20101221145335.974|20101221145337.479|TR0|of real rape victims everywhere, 
20101221145337.479|20101221145338.983|TR0|and that he is made to answer to 
20101221145338.983|20101221145340.488|TR0|them to the satisfaction of the 
20101221145340.488|20101221145341.993|TR0|justice system, at the very 
20101221145341.993|20101221145343.497|TR0|least.

20101221145345.002|20101221145346.507|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Naomi Wolf, what 
20101221145346.507|20101221145348.011|TR0|would you like to see?
20101221145348.011|20101221145349.516|TR0|
20101221145349.516|20101221145351.021|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: Well, I mean, 
20101221145351.021|20101221145352.525|TR0|what I'm interested in is equal 
20101221145352.525|20101221145354.030|TR0|justice and the rule of law. And 
20101221145354.030|20101221145355.535|TR0|so, I do believe that everyone 
20101221145355.535|20101221145357.040|TR0|who's accused of a serious crime 
20101221145357.040|20101221145358.544|TR0|needs to know that they are 
20101221145358.544|20101221145400.049|TR0|acting without someone's 
20101221145400.049|20101221145401.554|TR0|consent. So I'd like, going 
20101221145401.554|20101221145403.058|TR0|forward, for - you know, I think 
20101221145403.058|20101221145404.563|TR0|it's incumbent upon people to 
20101221145404.563|20101221145406.068|TR0|express to each other if they 
20101221145406.068|20101221145407.572|TR0|are consenting or not. And so, 
20101221145407.572|20101221145409.077|TR0|to me, I agree that there should 
20101221145409.077|20101221145410.582|TR0|be a hearing, obviously. But I 
20101221145410.582|20101221145412.087|TR0|think it should weigh very 
20101221145412.087|20101221145413.591|TR0|seriously, as it does for me, 
20101221145413.591|20101221145415.096|TR0|reading these, as a supporter of 
20101221145415.096|20101221145416.601|TR0|rape victims, as a crusader on 
20101221145416.601|20101221145418.105|TR0|the issue of rape - it is 
20101221145418.105|20101221145419.610|TR0|important that I don't see 
20101221145419.610|20101221145421.115|TR0|anywhere these women expressing 
20101221145421.115|20101221145422.619|TR0|a lack of consent. In fact, I 
20101221145422.619|20101221145424.124|TR0|see them indicating consensual 
20101221145424.124|20101221145425.629|TR0|willingness to engage in sex, 
20101221145425.629|20101221145427.133|TR0|consensual willingness to engage 
20101221145427.133|20101221145428.638|TR0|in sex without a condom. I see 
20101221145428.638|20101221145430.143|TR0|that from the record. So, to me, 
20101221145430.143|20101221145431.648|TR0|an impartial hearing would be 
20101221145431.648|20101221145433.152|TR0|ideal, if improbable.
20101221145433.152|20101221145434.657|TR0|
20101221145434.657|20101221145436.162|TR0|And I have to say, I think we 
20101221145436.162|20101221145437.666|TR0|are being naive. And I am kind 
20101221145437.666|20101221145439.171|TR0|of reluctant to be drawn into 
20101221145439.171|20101221145440.676|TR0|this side of the debate, because 
20101221145440.676|20101221145442.180|TR0|the larger picture is, why is 
20101221145442.180|20101221145443.685|TR0|the guy resisting coming back to 
20101221145443.685|20101221145445.190|TR0|Sweden? He's resisting coming 
20101221145445.190|20101221145446.695|TR0|back to Sweden the way any 
20101221145446.695|20101221145448.199|TR0|journalist would, because in 
20101221145448.199|20101221145449.704|TR0|Sweden they will extradite him 
20101221145449.704|20101221145451.209|TR0|to the United States, where he 
20101221145451.209|20101221145452.713|TR0|is facing, you know, prolonged 
20101221145452.713|20101221145454.218|TR0|isolation, like Bradley Manning, 
20101221145454.218|20101221145455.723|TR0|which drives people insane, 
20101221145455.723|20101221145457.227|TR0|according to human rights 
20101221145457.227|20101221145458.732|TR0|activists. He's facing being 
20101221145458.732|20101221145500.237|TR0|called an "enemy combatant" by 
20101221145500.237|20101221145501.741|TR0|some of our most senior 
20101221145501.741|20101221145503.246|TR0|political leaders, which would 
20101221145503.246|20101221145504.751|TR0|mean that they could ship him to 
20101221145504.751|20101221145506.256|TR0|Guantanamo, you know, where 
20101221145506.256|20101221145507.760|TR0|they're still torturing people, 
20101221145507.760|20101221145509.265|TR0|where they're still holding 
20101221145509.265|20101221145510.770|TR0|people in kangaroo court 
20101221145510.770|20101221145512.274|TR0|conditions, where there's still 
20101221145512.274|20101221145513.779|TR0|- you know, people are dying 
20101221145513.779|20101221145515.284|TR0|mysterious deaths in Guantanamo, 
20101221145515.284|20101221145516.788|TR0|even in Obama's Guantanamo, 
20101221145516.788|20101221145518.293|TR0|where he's facing abuse or 
20101221145518.293|20101221145519.798|TR0|mistreatment of hideous kinds 
20101221145519.798|20101221145521.303|TR0|and the possibility of never 
20101221145521.303|20101221145522.807|TR0|having due process, because we 
20101221145522.807|20101221145524.312|TR0|now have, you know, a banana 
20101221145524.312|20101221145525.817|TR0|republic situation off the coast 
20101221145525.817|20101221145527.321|TR0|of Cuba, where people can get 
20101221145527.321|20101221145528.826|TR0|lost in a black hole, where 
20101221145528.826|20101221145530.331|TR0|their innocence or guilt doesn't 
20101221145530.331|20101221145531.835|TR0|matter. And so, to be talking 
20101221145531.835|20101221145533.340|TR0|about, you know, these 
20101221145533.340|20101221145534.845|TR0|discussions about these 
20101221145534.845|20101221145536.349|TR0|complaints - you're right that 
20101221145536.349|20101221145537.854|TR0|they're not charges - without 
20101221145537.854|20101221145539.359|TR0|putting it in the larger picture 
20101221145539.359|20101221145540.864|TR0|of he's not every guy who 
20101221145540.864|20101221145542.368|TR0|doesn't want to go back to where 
20101221145542.368|20101221145543.873|TR0|women have accused him of sexual 
20101221145543.873|20101221145545.378|TR0|impropriety. He's a guy who, if 
20101221145545.378|20101221145546.882|TR0|he goes back, is going to lose 
20101221145546.882|20101221145548.387|TR0|his freedom and his life, 
20101221145548.387|20101221145549.892|TR0|because he's being made a 
20101221145549.892|20101221145551.396|TR0|scapegoat and a martyr, you 
20101221145551.396|20101221145552.901|TR0|know, on behalf of journalists 
20101221145552.901|20101221145554.406|TR0|everywhere by the most powerful 
20101221145554.406|20101221145555.911|TR0|government on earth, that 
20101221145555.911|20101221145557.415|TR0|doesn't want whistleblowers 
20101221145557.415|20101221145558.920|TR0|shining any kind of light on 
20101221145558.920|20101221145600.425|TR0|their wrongdoing, even as they 
20101221145600.425|20101221145601.929|TR0|continue to surveil us, wiretap 
20101221145601.929|20101221145603.434|TR0|us, break the Fourth Amendment 
20101221145603.434|20101221145604.939|TR0|every single day. So, I think we 
20101221145604.939|20101221145606.443|TR0|have to keep that larger picture 
20101221145606.443|20101221145607.948|TR0|in mind.
20101221145607.948|20101221145609.453|TR0|
20101221145609.453|20101221145610.957|TR0|I would like justice to be done. 
20101221145610.957|20101221145612.462|TR0|I would like a hearing. But I 
20101221145612.462|20101221145613.967|TR0|would also like my country to 
20101221145613.967|20101221145615.472|TR0|behave according to the rule of 
20101221145615.472|20101221145616.976|TR0|law and my country to stop 
20101221145616.976|20101221145618.481|TR0|acting like a global bully, you 
20101221145618.481|20101221145619.986|TR0|know, intimidating other nations 
20101221145619.986|20101221145621.490|TR0|and other judicial systems, 
20101221145621.490|20101221145622.995|TR0|which is clearly what happened 
20101221145622.995|20101221145624.500|TR0|here, into bullying and 
20101221145624.500|20101221145626.004|TR0|intimidating journalists, 
20101221145626.004|20101221145627.509|TR0|because, believe me, Amy, if he 
20101221145627.509|20101221145629.014|TR0|is taken into custody, if he is 
20101221145629.014|20101221145630.519|TR0|prosecuted under the Espionage 
20101221145630.519|20101221145632.023|TR0|Act, which closed down dissent 
20101221145632.023|20101221145633.528|TR0|in this country for a decade, 
20101221145633.528|20101221145635.033|TR0|and he's made an example of in 
20101221145635.033|20101221145636.537|TR0|this way - wrongly, because he's 
20101221145636.537|20101221145638.042|TR0|the New York Times, not the 
20101221145638.042|20101221145639.547|TR0|Daniel Ellsberg in the case; he 
20101221145639.547|20101221145641.051|TR0|is just the publisher - then you 
20101221145641.051|20101221145642.556|TR0|and I are not going to be safe 
20101221145642.556|20101221145644.061|TR0|doing our jobs as journalists 
20101221145644.061|20101221145645.566|TR0|any longer.

20101221145647.070|20101221145648.575|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Jaclyn Friedman, 
20101221145648.575|20101221145650.080|TR0|do you find any common ground 
20101221145650.080|20101221145651.584|TR0|here?
20101221145651.584|20101221145653.089|TR0|
20101221145653.089|20101221145654.594|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: Naomi, I 
20101221145654.594|20101221145656.098|TR0|couldn't agree with you more 
20101221145656.098|20101221145657.603|TR0|about my concerns. Yes, I could 
20101221145657.603|20101221145659.108|TR0|not agree more about concerns 
20101221145659.108|20101221145700.612|TR0|about having him extradited to 
20101221145700.612|20101221145702.117|TR0|the United States, about the 
20101221145702.117|20101221145703.622|TR0|Espionage Act. I agree with you 
20101221145703.622|20101221145705.127|TR0|about all of that. However, I 
20101221145705.127|20101221145706.631|TR0|speak for myself and many, many 
20101221145706.631|20101221145708.136|TR0|rape victims when I say we are 
20101221145708.136|20101221145709.641|TR0|so tired of having our bodies 
20101221145709.641|20101221145711.145|TR0|thrown under the bus for the 
20101221145711.145|20101221145712.650|TR0|concerns of a powerful white 
20101221145712.650|20101221145714.155|TR0|guy. I totally agree, but I 
20101221145714.155|20101221145715.659|TR0|would like to see - and if he 
20101221145715.659|20101221145717.164|TR0|does get extradited to the U.S. 
20101221145717.164|20101221145718.669|TR0|from Sweden, I will be on the 
20101221145718.669|20101221145720.174|TR0|front lines with you protesting 
20101221145720.174|20101221145721.678|TR0|that. But, denying these two 
20101221145721.678|20101221145723.183|TR0|women justice is a denial of 
20101221145723.183|20101221145724.688|TR0|justice. He needs to be made to 
20101221145724.688|20101221145726.192|TR0|answer these charges anyway. 
20101221145726.192|20101221145727.697|TR0|While, yes, I think it is 
20101221145727.697|20101221145729.202|TR0|political and extraordinary the 
20101221145729.202|20101221145730.706|TR0|way this is being pursued, it's 
20101221145730.706|20101221145732.211|TR0|an opportunity to raise the bar 
20101221145732.211|20101221145733.716|TR0|for the women of Sweden and the 
20101221145733.716|20101221145735.220|TR0|women internationally for what 
20101221145735.220|20101221145736.725|TR0|we can expect from our justice 
20101221145736.725|20101221145738.230|TR0|systems for women who are 
20101221145738.230|20101221145739.735|TR0|alleging sexual violence.

20101221145741.239|20101221145742.744|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: And I would have 
20101221145742.744|20101221145744.249|TR0|to say that I think you're 
20101221145744.249|20101221145745.753|TR0|living in a -
20101221145745.753|20101221145747.258|TR0|
20101221145747.258|20101221145748.763|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Naomi Wolf, 
20101221145748.763|20101221145750.267|TR0|final words.
20101221145750.267|20101221145751.772|TR0|
20101221145751.772|20101221145753.277|TR0|>> NAOMI WOLF: I mean, I think 
20101221145753.277|20101221145754.782|TR0|it's a fantasy world to think 
20101221145754.782|20101221145756.286|TR0|that after this case is over the 
20101221145756.286|20101221145757.791|TR0|bar will be raised at all. This 
20101221145757.791|20101221145759.296|TR0|is the last time we're ever 
20101221145759.296|20101221145800.800|TR0|going to see consensual sex 
20101221145800.800|20101221145802.305|TR0|involving a dispute about a 
20101221145802.305|20101221145803.810|TR0|condom criminalized. And it's 
20101221145803.810|20101221145805.314|TR0|the first time I've seen it in 
20101221145805.314|20101221145806.819|TR0|23 years, and I am sure that 
20101221145806.819|20101221145808.324|TR0|after they've done whatever 
20101221145808.324|20101221145809.828|TR0|violent, brutal thing they're 
20101221145809.828|20101221145811.333|TR0|planning to do to Julian 
20101221145811.333|20101221145812.838|TR0|Assange, it's the last time 
20101221145812.838|20101221145814.343|TR0|we're going to see it. I don't 
20101221145814.343|20101221145815.847|TR0|think it helps the women of 
20101221145815.847|20101221145817.352|TR0|Sweden in the least to 
20101221145817.352|20101221145818.857|TR0|trivialize the very real issue 
20101221145818.857|20101221145820.361|TR0|of rape with this kind of thing.
20101221145820.361|20101221145821.866|TR0|
20101221145821.866|20101221145823.371|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: Many, many 
20101221145823.371|20101221145824.875|TR0|of the women in Sweden think it 
20101221145824.875|20101221145826.380|TR0|is helping them. And I listen to 
20101221145826.380|20101221145827.885|TR0|the women there.
20101221145827.885|20101221145829.390|TR0|

20101221145830.894|20101221145832.399|TR0|the women there, too, and I 
20101221145832.399|20101221145833.904|TR0|guess there are many women in 
20101221145833.904|20101221145835.408|TR0|Sweden who have different 
20101221145835.408|20101221145836.913|TR0|opinions about this.
