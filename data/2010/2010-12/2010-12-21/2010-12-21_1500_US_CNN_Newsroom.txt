20101221150007.000|20101221150009.000|TR0|KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR:  All right.  
20101221150009.000|20101221150012.000|TR0|Well, it's 10:00 a.m. on the East Coast, 
20101221150012.000|20101221150014.000|TR0|7:00 a.m. out west.  Here's some of the 
20101221150014.000|20101221150017.000|TR0|stories that have us talking this morning 
20101221150017.000|20101221150019.000|TR0|as you're getting going.  Social security 
20101221150019.000|20101221150022.000|TR0|checks crossing into the electronic age.  
20101221150022.000|20101221150024.000|TR0|People applying for benefits after May 
20101221150024.000|20101221150027.000|TR0|1st.  We'll have their check automatically 
20101221150027.000|20101221150029.000|TR0|deposited in the bank account.  Those 
20101221150029.000|20101221150032.000|TR0|already getting benefits will have to make 
20101221150032.000|20101221150034.000|TR0|similar arrangements within the next 
20101221150034.000|20101221150037.000|TR0|couple of years.
20101221150037.000|20101221150039.000|TR0|
20101221150039.000|20101221150042.000|TR0|The U.S. government making Toyota pay more 
20101221150042.000|20101221150044.000|TR0|than $32 million for a series of 
20101221150044.000|20101221150047.000|TR0|high-profile recalls.  Civil penalties are 
20101221150047.000|20101221150049.000|TR0|the maximum allowed by law and punishment 
20101221150049.000|20101221150052.000|TR0|a company for its handling of the 
20101221150052.000|20101221150054.000|TR0|problems.  The money will help pay for two 
20101221150054.000|20101221150057.000|TR0|federal investigations.
20101221150057.000|20101221150059.000|TR0|
20101221150059.000|20101221150102.000|TR0|One hour from now, we're going to find out 
20101221150102.000|20101221150104.000|TR0|how many people live in the United States 
20101221150104.000|20101221150107.000|TR0|and where.  The 2010 census will show how 
20101221150107.000|20101221150109.000|TR0|the country has changed over the past 
20101221150109.000|20101221150112.000|TR0|decade.  And it will use those population 
20101221150112.000|20101221150115.000|TR0|shifts to assign congressional seats and 
20101221150115.000|20101221150117.000|TR0|electoral votes.
20101221150117.000|20101221150120.000|TR0|
20101221150120.000|20101221150122.000|TR0|OK.  This story got a lot of people 
20101221150122.000|20101221150125.000|TR0|talking, including us.  And it happened in 
20101221150125.000|20101221150127.000|TR0|a way that pit the U.S. Constitution 
20101221150127.000|20101221150130.000|TR0|against pedophilia.  Sheriff's deputies 
20101221150130.000|20101221150132.000|TR0|from Florida went all the way to Colorado 
20101221150132.000|20101221150135.000|TR0|to arrest this man, Phillip Greeves.  He 
20101221150135.000|20101221150137.000|TR0|should be in a Florida courtroom today.  
20101221150137.000|20101221150140.000|TR0|Why?  Well, cops say Greeves sold and sent 
20101221150140.000|20101221150142.000|TR0|them an autographed copy of his book.
20101221150142.000|20101221150145.000|TR0|
20101221150145.000|20101221150147.000|TR0|Now, brace yourself for the title if you 
20101221150147.000|20101221150150.000|TR0|haven't heard this story already.  It's 
20101221150150.000|20101221150152.000|TR0|called "The Pedophile Guide to Love and 
20101221150152.000|20101221150155.000|TR0|Pleasure." Yes, it makes you sick to your 
20101221150155.000|20101221150157.000|TR0|stomach.  They busted him for obscenity.  
20101221150157.000|20101221150200.000|TR0|He said he broke Florida law.  Now, no one 
20101221150200.000|20101221150202.000|TR0|is defending Greeves subject matter but 
20101221150202.000|20101221150205.000|TR0|some folks are defending his  freedom of 
20101221150205.000|20101221150207.000|TR0|speech.
20101221150207.000|20101221150210.000|TR0|
20101221150210.000|20101221150212.000|TR0|CNN's senior legal analyst Jeff Toobin 
20101221150212.000|20101221150215.000|TR0|says that the book might be despicable, 
20101221150215.000|20101221150218.000|TR0|but the book doesn't actually show 
20101221150218.000|20101221150220.000|TR0|children being abused.  He says words 
20101221150220.000|20101221150223.000|TR0|alone don't justify busting him.  But take 
20101221150223.000|20101221150225.000|TR0|a look at part of the Florida law.  And 
20101221150225.000|20101221150228.000|TR0|it's kind of complicated here. It's wordy. 
20101221150228.000|20101221150230.000|TR0| So stay with me.
20101221150230.000|20101221150233.000|TR0|
20101221150233.000|20101221150235.000|TR0|It nabs anyone who "knowingly writes, 
20101221150235.000|20101221150238.000|TR0|prints, publishes, or utters, or causes to 
20101221150238.000|20101221150240.000|TR0|be written, printed, published, or uttered 
20101221150240.000|20101221150243.000|TR0|any advertisement or notice of any kind 
20101221150243.000|20101221150245.000|TR0|giving information, directly or 
20101221150245.000|20101221150248.000|TR0|indirectly, stating or purporting to state 
20101221150248.000|20101221150250.000|TR0|where, how, or whom, or by what means any 
20101221150250.000|20101221150253.000|TR0|or what purports to be any such material, 
20101221150253.000|20101221150255.000|TR0|matter, article, or thing of any such 
20101221150255.000|20101221150258.000|TR0|character can be purchased, obtained, or 
20101221150258.000|20101221150300.000|TR0|had."     I know, that's a mouthful.  It's 
20101221150300.000|20101221150303.000|TR0|hard to keep up with the legal jargon, but 
20101221150303.000|20101221150305.000|TR0|it pretty much covers every single base.  
20101221150305.000|20101221150308.000|TR0|No wiggle room, even uttering can get you 
20101221150308.000|20101221150310.000|TR0|in big trouble.  Let's talk about this 
20101221150310.000|20101221150313.000|TR0|with David Bayh.  He's a lawyer in 
20101221150313.000|20101221150315.000|TR0|Richmond who knows a lot about the first 
20101221150315.000|20101221150318.000|TR0|amendment.  It's also got - we've also got 
20101221150318.000|20101221150321.000|TR0|Grady Judd on the phone. He's actually the 
20101221150321.000|20101221150323.000|TR0|sheriff of Polk County, Florida, where 
20101221150323.000|20101221150326.000|TR0|Greeves should be in court today.
20101221150326.000|20101221150328.000|TR0|
20101221150328.000|20101221150331.000|TR0|So sheriff, let me start with you, what 
20101221150331.000|20101221150333.000|TR0|gives you so much confidence?  I mean, 
20101221150333.000|20101221150336.000|TR0|obviously you arrested him.  But why do 
20101221150336.000|20101221150338.000|TR0|you believe that he can also be prosecuted?
20101221150338.000|20101221150341.000|TR0|
20101221150341.000|20101221150343.000|TR0|SHERIFF GRADY JUDD, POLK COUNTY, FLORIDA 
20101221150343.000|20101221150346.000|TR0|(ON THE PHONE):  It's really simple.  The 
20101221150346.000|20101221150348.000|TR0|experts are confusing child pornography 
20101221150348.000|20101221150351.000|TR0|laws with obscenity laws.  In the state of 
20101221150351.000|20101221150353.000|TR0|Florida, as you just read, there's a 
20101221150353.000|20101221150356.000|TR0|specific obscenity law.  And to me it's 
20101221150356.000|20101221150358.000|TR0|very clear.  You cannot take real life 
20101221150358.000|20101221150401.000|TR0|examples of how to sexually batter a 
20101221150401.000|20101221150403.000|TR0|nine-year-old and a 13- year-old child and 
20101221150403.000|20101221150406.000|TR0|educate, sell, or promote that according 
20101221150406.000|20101221150408.000|TR0|to Florida law.
20101221150408.000|20101221150411.000|TR0|
20101221150411.000|20101221150413.000|TR0|Yes, there's first amendment experts that 
20101221150413.000|20101221150416.000|TR0|talk about freedom of the press and all 
20101221150416.000|20101221150418.000|TR0|that and no one could agree with freedom 
20101221150418.000|20101221150421.000|TR0|of the press or the right to free  speech 
20101221150421.000|20101221150424.000|TR0|more than me because I like to exercise 
20101221150424.000|20101221150426.000|TR0|that.  But you can't sit in a crowded 
20101221150426.000|20101221150429.000|TR0|theater and scream fire either.  There's 
20101221150429.000|20101221150431.000|TR0|just some things you can't do.  And we 
20101221150431.000|20101221150434.000|TR0|believe this is one of them.  And no one 
20101221150434.000|20101221150436.000|TR0|else was acting on this.  We were able to 
20101221150436.000|20101221150439.000|TR0|obtain jurisdiction, so we arrested him by 
20101221150439.000|20101221150441.000|TR0|a very good obscenity law in Florida.
20101221150441.000|20101221150444.000|TR0|
20101221150444.000|20101221150446.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  David Baugh, what do you say to 
20101221150446.000|20101221150449.000|TR0|that?  The sheriff seems very confident 
20101221150449.000|20101221150451.000|TR0|that not only he arrested this guy, but he 
20101221150451.000|20101221150454.000|TR0|can prosecute him.
20101221150454.000|20101221150456.000|TR0|
20101221150456.000|20101221150459.000|TR0|DAVID BAUGH, ATTORNEY:  Well, I would 
20101221150459.000|20101221150501.000|TR0|agree that it's certainly a violation of 
20101221150501.000|20101221150504.000|TR0|the Florida statute.  On the other hand, I 
20101221150504.000|20101221150506.000|TR0|have no doubt that the Florida statute  is 
20101221150506.000|20101221150509.000|TR0|unconstitutional.  Prosecuting people for 
20101221150509.000|20101221150511.000|TR0|thinking or uttering or speaking is in and 
20101221150511.000|20101221150514.000|TR0|of itself can never be a crime in this 
20101221150514.000|20101221150516.000|TR0|country.  Every idea must be discussed, 
20101221150516.000|20101221150519.000|TR0|even bad ideas, even disgusting ideas 
20101221150519.000|20101221150521.000|TR0|should be talked about so we can decide 
20101221150521.000|20101221150524.000|TR0|whether or not to follow them or throw 
20101221150524.000|20101221150527.000|TR0|them aside.
20101221150527.000|20101221150529.000|TR0|
20101221150529.000|20101221150532.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And here's what's interesting, 
20101221150532.000|20101221150534.000|TR0|David.  You even said - and this caught my 
20101221150534.000|20101221150537.000|TR0|attention - that maybe you would want to 
20101221150537.000|20101221150539.000|TR0|read this because it would help you 
20101221150539.000|20101221150542.000|TR0|actually protect children.
20101221150542.000|20101221150544.000|TR0|
20101221150544.000|20101221150547.000|TR0|BAUGH:  I think - when I heard about this, 
20101221150547.000|20101221150549.000|TR0|I wasn't that interested.  But this 
20101221150549.000|20101221150552.000|TR0|morning when I went online and I read some 
20101221150552.000|20101221150554.000|TR0|more about it, I came up with the analogy. 
20101221150554.000|20101221150557.000|TR0| When I go scuba diving, I want to know 
20101221150557.000|20101221150559.000|TR0|about sharks.  When I walk in the jungle, 
20101221150559.000|20101221150602.000|TR0|I would want to know about lions.
20101221150602.000|20101221150604.000|TR0|
20101221150604.000|20101221150607.000|TR0|Well, as a parent, as a grandparent and as 
20101221150607.000|20101221150609.000|TR0|a concerned citizen, I want to know about 
20101221150609.000|20101221150612.000|TR0|pedophiles.  I want to know how they 
20101221150612.000|20101221150614.000|TR0|think, I want to know how to protect my 
20101221150614.000|20101221150617.000|TR0|children, and I might buy this book.
20101221150617.000|20101221150619.000|TR0|
20101221150619.000|20101221150622.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Sheriff, let me ask you first 
20101221150622.000|20101221150624.000|TR0|about what Mr. Baugh said about this 
20101221150624.000|20101221150627.000|TR0|statute, the Florida statute there in your 
20101221150627.000|20101221150630.000|TR0|state being unconstitutional.  Do you 
20101221150630.000|20101221150632.000|TR0|agree?
20101221150632.000|20101221150635.000|TR0|
20101221150635.000|20101221150637.000|TR0|JUDD:  No, it's - I don't believe it's 
20101221150637.000|20101221150640.000|TR0|unconstitutional.  This obscenity law has 
20101221150640.000|20101221150642.000|TR0|been upheld in the past.  In fact, we've 
20101221150642.000|20101221150645.000|TR0|used this obscenity law over the years.  
20101221150645.000|20101221150647.000|TR0|But, you know, there's a difference in 
20101221150647.000|20101221150650.000|TR0|commercial speech and personal speech and 
20101221150650.000|20101221150652.000|TR0|selling a book, directing people how to 
20101221150652.000|20101221150655.000|TR0|abuse children.
20101221150655.000|20101221150657.000|TR0|
20101221150657.000|20101221150700.000|TR0|And that's where we're narrowly tailoring 
20101221150700.000|20101221150702.000|TR0|and focusing this issue.  You know, I stay 
20101221150702.000|20101221150705.000|TR0|out of the woods where there's lions.  And 
20101221150705.000|20101221150707.000|TR0|quite frankly these predators who think 
20101221150707.000|20101221150710.000|TR0|they're going to have this book are going 
20101221150710.000|20101221150712.000|TR0|to learn they need to stay out of the 
20101221150712.000|20101221150715.000|TR0|woods where they can be arrested for that. 
20101221150715.000|20101221150717.000|TR0| And certainly that's in the state of 
20101221150717.000|20101221150720.000|TR0|Florida.
20101221150720.000|20101221150722.000|TR0|
20101221150722.000|20101221150725.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  So David, let me ask you about 
20101221150725.000|20101221150727.000|TR0|the obscenity part that the sheriff is 
20101221150727.000|20101221150730.000|TR0|focusing on.  You know, this manual has no 
20101221150730.000|20101221150733.000|TR0|visuals. There are no cartoons, there are 
20101221150733.000|20101221150735.000|TR0|no pictures.  It's just words.  So does it 
20101221150735.000|20101221150738.000|TR0|really violate federal law without the 
20101221150738.000|20101221150740.000|TR0|visuals?  Because according to a Supreme 
20101221150740.000|20101221150743.000|TR0|Court case in 2002, you know, child 
20101221150743.000|20101221150745.000|TR0|pornography was defined as visual 
20101221150745.000|20101221150748.000|TR0|depiction.
20101221150748.000|20101221150750.000|TR0|
20101221150750.000|20101221150753.000|TR0|BAUGH:  That is correct.  We've had cases 
20101221150753.000|20101221150755.000|TR0|like that in Virginia where drawings have 
20101221150755.000|20101221150758.000|TR0|been found not to be visual depictions.  I 
20101221150758.000|20101221150800.000|TR0|mean, the laws are designed to protect 
20101221150800.000|20101221150803.000|TR0|children.  I would hope that the sheriff 
20101221150803.000|20101221150805.000|TR0|if he's really going to file the statute 
20101221150805.000|20101221150808.000|TR0|will go ahead and prosecute those who 
20101221150808.000|20101221150810.000|TR0|would sell (INAUDIBLE) which advocated a 
20101221150810.000|20101221150813.000|TR0|murder of Jews.  There are similar books 
20101221150813.000|20101221150815.000|TR0|"Lolita," by (INAUDIBLE) talks about 
20101221150815.000|20101221150818.000|TR0|interactions with an underage child.
20101221150818.000|20101221150820.000|TR0|
20101221150820.000|20101221150823.000|TR0|These are ideas, and ideas cannot be 
20101221150823.000|20101221150825.000|TR0|prosecuted.  And further, as an advocate 
20101221150825.000|20101221150828.000|TR0|of  the first amendment, that means you 
20101221150828.000|20101221150830.000|TR0|have to tolerate other  people's words and 
20101221150830.000|20101221150833.000|TR0|other people's thinking.  And for that 
20101221150833.000|20101221150835.000|TR0|reason, I think that statute is 
20101221150835.000|20101221150838.000|TR0|unconstitutional.  And I have little doubt 
20101221150838.000|20101221150841.000|TR0|that like the cross burning case we  had 
20101221150841.000|20101221150843.000|TR0|in Virginia years ago, even though it is 
20101221150843.000|20101221150846.000|TR0|reprehensible, the statute will be found 
20101221150846.000|20101221150848.000|TR0|to be unconstitutional.  You cannot 
20101221150848.000|20101221150851.000|TR0|regulate thought or words alone.
20101221150851.000|20101221150853.000|TR0|
20101221150853.000|20101221150856.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, we're definitely going to 
20101221150856.000|20101221150858.000|TR0|follow the case.  And sheriff before I let 
20101221150858.000|20101221150901.000|TR0|both of you go, what did - if anything, 
20101221150901.000|20101221150903.000|TR0|did Mr. Greeves say to the arresting 
20101221150903.000|20101221150906.000|TR0|deputies?  And when could we see him in 
20101221150906.000|20101221150908.000|TR0|court today?
20101221150908.000|20101221150911.000|TR0|
20101221150911.000|20101221150913.000|TR0|JUDD:  Greeves admitted that he wrote the 
20101221150913.000|20101221150916.000|TR0|book.  He admitted that he sold us the 
20101221150916.000|20101221150918.000|TR0|book and autographed it.  Greeves should 
20101221150918.000|20101221150921.000|TR0|arrive at our book-in at the county jail 
20101221150921.000|20101221150923.000|TR0|some time around 11:00 a.m. to noon 
20101221150923.000|20101221150926.000|TR0|Eastern time.  He will be booked into jail 
20101221150926.000|20101221150928.000|TR0|and then have a first appearance hearing 
20101221150928.000|20101221150931.000|TR0|tomorrow.
20101221150931.000|20101221150933.000|TR0|
20101221150933.000|20101221150936.000|TR0|And quite frankly, our position is that, 
20101221150936.000|20101221150938.000|TR0|you know, this law is on the book, it's a 
20101221150938.000|20101221150941.000|TR0|solid law, it's been defended in the past, 
20101221150941.000|20101221150944.000|TR0|and we're going to go forward.  And we 
20101221150944.000|20101221150946.000|TR0|didn't do this in a vacuum.  We certainly 
20101221150946.000|20101221150949.000|TR0|did this with the guidance of our state 
20101221150949.000|20101221150951.000|TR0|attorney's office and an independent 
20101221150951.000|20101221150954.000|TR0|judicial review by a circuit court judge.  
20101221150954.000|20101221150956.000|TR0|We look forward to it.  That's what the 
20101221150956.000|20101221150959.000|TR0|courts are for.  We respect the courts and 
20101221150959.000|20101221151001.000|TR0|we also respect the rights to protect 
20101221151001.000|20101221151004.000|TR0|children from predators.     PHILLIPS:  
20101221151004.000|20101221151006.000|TR0|It'll be interesting to follow the case.  
20101221151006.000|20101221151009.000|TR0|And I now that we all agree  that what 
20101221151009.000|20101221151011.000|TR0|this man has done is despicable and 
20101221151011.000|20101221151014.000|TR0|disgusting.  That is for sure.  David 
20101221151014.000|20101221151016.000|TR0|Baugh, Sheriff Grady Judd, great to have 
20101221151016.000|20101221151019.000|TR0|you both.  Thank you so much for your time 
20101221151019.000|20101221151021.000|TR0|today.
20101221151021.000|20101221151024.000|TR0|
20101221151024.000|20101221151026.000|TR0|JUDD:  Thank you.  Have a great day.
20101221151026.000|20101221151029.000|TR0|
20101221151029.000|20101221151031.000|TR0|BAUGH:  Thank you.
20101221151031.000|20101221151034.000|TR0|
20101221151034.000|20101221151036.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  You bet.
20101221151036.000|20101221151039.000|TR0|
20101221151039.000|20101221151041.000|TR0|Severe weather hammering both ends of 
20101221151041.000|20101221151044.000|TR0|California to the north, the Sierra Nevada 
20101221151044.000|20101221151047.000|TR0| mountains, buried under as much as 10 
20101221151047.000|20101221151049.000|TR0|feet of snow. By later today, snow could 
20101221151049.000|20101221151052.000|TR0|pile 15 feet high.  Wind gusts toppled a 
20101221151052.000|20101221151054.000|TR0|startling 150 miles on one summit, the 
20101221151054.000|20101221151057.000|TR0|alpine meadows.  In southern California, 
20101221151057.000|20101221151059.000|TR0|heavy rains have caused widespread 
20101221151059.000|20101221151102.000|TR0|flooding and a few mud slides and things 
20101221151102.000|20101221151104.000|TR0|could get worse over the next several  
20101221151104.000|20101221151107.000|TR0|days.  Let's get the latest, shall we?
20101221151107.000|20101221151109.000|TR0|
20101221151109.000|20101221151112.000|TR0|CNN's Casey Wian in Ventura County.  Is it 
20101221151112.000|20101221151114.000|TR0|getting any better, Casey?
20101221151114.000|20101221151117.000|TR0|
20101221151117.000|20101221151119.000|TR0|CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the 
20101221151119.000|20101221151122.000|TR0|rain's let up a little bit, Kyra, but 
20101221151122.000|20101221151124.000|TR0|behind me, you can see the Pacific Coast 
20101221151124.000|20101221151127.000|TR0|highway here in Ventura County has been 
20101221151127.000|20101221151129.000|TR0|closed.  It has been closed for a couple 
20101221151129.000|20101221151132.000|TR0|of days now.  20-mile stretch of this road 
20101221151132.000|20101221151134.000|TR0|has been closed because of a mud slide to 
20101221151134.000|20101221151137.000|TR0|the northwest of me.
20101221151137.000|20101221151139.000|TR0|
20101221151139.000|20101221151142.000|TR0|Authorities have been working throughout 
20101221151142.000|20101221151144.000|TR0|the night clearing some of that debris, 
20101221151144.000|20101221151147.000|TR0|but they still apparently believe that 
20101221151147.000|20101221151150.000|TR0|these hills behind me are still too 
20101221151150.000|20101221151152.000|TR0|dangerous and fragile because of the 
20101221151152.000|20101221151155.000|TR0|anticipation that more rain will be coming 
20101221151155.000|20101221151157.000|TR0|through this area.  This storm is very, 
20101221151157.000|20101221151200.000|TR0|very widespread.  It has spread all the 
20101221151200.000|20101221151202.000|TR0|way to Las Vegas where there has been some 
20101221151202.000|20101221151205.000|TR0|flooding there, as well.  As well as 
20101221151205.000|20101221151207.000|TR0|record rainfall and flash flood warnings.
20101221151207.000|20101221151210.000|TR0|
20101221151210.000|20101221151212.000|TR0|In the Sierra Nevadas, as you mentioned, 
20101221151212.000|20101221151215.000|TR0|we've had snow in Mammoth Mountain, up to 
20101221151215.000|20101221151217.000|TR0|13 1/2 feet since Friday.  We've had wind 
20101221151217.000|20101221151220.000|TR0|speeds of up to 150 miles an hour at some 
20101221151220.000|20101221151222.000|TR0|of the higher peaks.  Back here at sea 
20101221151222.000|20101221151225.000|TR0|level, most of the impact has been on 
20101221151225.000|20101221151227.000|TR0|traffic.  There have been a lot of traffic 
20101221151227.000|20101221151230.000|TR0|accidents throughout southern  California 
20101221151230.000|20101221151232.000|TR0|the last couple of days.
20101221151232.000|20101221151235.000|TR0|
20101221151235.000|20101221151237.000|TR0|We've also had power outages, 20,000 folks 
20101221151237.000|20101221151240.000|TR0|without power throughout the southern  
20101221151240.000|20101221151242.000|TR0|California region.  And as you mentioned, 
20101221151242.000|20101221151245.000|TR0|we're bracing for much more rain  forecast 
20101221151245.000|20101221151247.000|TR0|later tonight.  We'll have to see how 
20101221151247.000|20101221151250.000|TR0|these fire-ravaged hillsides in some areas 
20101221151250.000|20101221151253.000|TR0|are going to hold up.  We're hoping that 
20101221151253.000|20101221151255.000|TR0|they continue to hold up.  And we won't 
20101221151255.000|20101221151258.000|TR0|lose any homes to mud slides because this 
20101221151258.000|20101221151300.000|TR0|region as you well know, Kyra, has a 
20101221151300.000|20101221151303.000|TR0|history of that.  When there's fire damage 
20101221151303.000|20101221151305.000|TR0|and heavy rain. And that's what we've got 
20101221151305.000|20101221151308.000|TR0|right now.  Kyra.
20101221151308.000|20101221151310.000|TR0|
20101221151310.000|20101221151313.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   That's right.  Boy, I miss my 
20101221151313.000|20101221151315.000|TR0|hometown, but I don't miss conditions like 
20101221151315.000|20101221151318.000|TR0|that, Casey.  That's for sure.  Thank you 
20101221151318.000|20101221151320.000|TR0|so much.     Well, millions of 
20101221151320.000|20101221151323.000|TR0|Californians have no relief in sight.  In 
20101221151323.000|20101221151325.000|TR0|fact, things are likely to get much worse. 
20101221151325.000|20101221151328.000|TR0| Casey hit on that a little bit and of 
20101221151328.000|20101221151330.000|TR0|course, CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano has 
20101221151330.000|20101221151333.000|TR0|more.
20101221151333.000|20101221151335.000|TR0|
20101221151335.000|20101221151338.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  About 
20101221151338.000|20101221151340.000|TR0|another 36 hours, I think, Kyra, and then 
20101221151340.000|20101221151343.000|TR0|we're going to (INAUDIBLE) off.
20101221151343.000|20101221151345.000|TR0|
20101221151345.000|20101221151348.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  That's a long time.
20101221151348.000|20101221151350.000|TR0|
20101221151350.000|20101221151353.000|TR0|MARCIANO: Yes.  That time, we're going to 
20101221151353.000|20101221151356.000|TR0|see probably some of our heavier rain.  We 
20101221151356.000|20101221151358.000|TR0|got a couple of things going on.  First of 
20101221151358.000|20101221151401.000|TR0|all, here is the main plume that continues 
20101221151401.000|20101221151403.000|TR0|to point into southern California.  But 
20101221151403.000|20101221151406.000|TR0|this is the kicker, the kicker, the main 
20101221151406.000|20101221151408.000|TR0|part of the upper level storm that's going 
20101221151408.000|20101221151411.000|TR0|to really throw a  wrench in this and kick 
20101221151411.000|20101221151413.000|TR0|everything up.  But it's going to take 
20101221151413.000|20101221151416.000|TR0|some time to  do that. And while it does 
20101221151416.000|20101221151418.000|TR0|that, it's going to really turn up the 
20101221151418.000|20101221151421.000|TR0|energy as far as cranking out a little bit 
20101221151421.000|20101221151423.000|TR0|more in the way of moisture.
20101221151423.000|20101221151426.000|TR0|
20101221151426.000|20101221151428.000|TR0|Here's what we think is going to happen as 
20101221151428.000|20101221151431.000|TR0|far as our computer models are concerned.  
20101221151431.000|20101221151433.000|TR0|Another one inch, potentially two in Los 
20101221151433.000|20101221151436.000|TR0|Angeles.  Some of the hills around L.A., 
20101221151436.000|20101221151438.000|TR0|of course, we'll see more than that, maybe 
20101221151438.000|20101221151441.000|TR0|four to five inches of rainfall here 
20101221151441.000|20101221151443.000|TR0|across parts of Southern California.
20101221151443.000|20101221151446.000|TR0|
20101221151446.000|20101221151448.000|TR0|We've already seen a foot, mentioned that, 
20101221151448.000|20101221151451.000|TR0|and locally some higher amount.  That is 
20101221151451.000|20101221151453.000|TR0|also been made into snow, upwards of 13 
20101221151453.000|20101221151456.000|TR0|feet. Probably will see 20 feet before 
20101221151456.000|20101221151459.000|TR0|this is done.  And here's the moisture on 
20101221151459.000|20101221151501.000|TR0|the radar scope.  So with this amount of 
20101221151501.000|20101221151504.000|TR0|rain coming in, we're looking not only for 
20101221151504.000|20101221151506.000|TR0|mud slides but street  flooding, as well.
20101221151506.000|20101221151509.000|TR0|
20101221151509.000|20101221151511.000|TR0|Some white showing up there.  That means 
20101221151511.000|20101221151514.000|TR0|that some of this is turning into snow at 
20101221151514.000|20101221151516.000|TR0|the high elevations.  The snow levels are 
20101221151516.000|20101221151519.000|TR0|beginning to come down.  That will act to 
20101221151519.000|20101221151521.000|TR0|lock up some of the moisture at the higher 
20101221151521.000|20101221151524.000|TR0|elevations.  But with three to six inches 
20101221151524.000|20101221151526.000|TR0|of rainfall potentially coming down, that 
20101221151526.000|20101221151529.000|TR0|may not be enough.  This is all moving to 
20101221151529.000|20101221151531.000|TR0|the east.  One to three feet potentially 
20101221151531.000|20101221151534.000|TR0|in the Wasatch, three to six feet 
20101221151534.000|20101221151536.000|TR0|potentially across parts of Colorado.
20101221151536.000|20101221151539.000|TR0|
20101221151539.000|20101221151541.000|TR0|High avalanche danger.  I know all that 
20101221151541.000|20101221151544.000|TR0|snow sounds great but it does bring with 
20101221151544.000|20101221151546.000|TR0|it some danger.  I do want to point out 
20101221151546.000|20101221151549.000|TR0|one thing as far as where the storm is 
20101221151549.000|20101221151551.000|TR0|going to go over the next day or two.
20101221151551.000|20101221151554.000|TR0|
20101221151554.000|20101221151556.000|TR0|People are asking is it going to come 
20101221151556.000|20101221151559.000|TR0|east?  It is.  Is it going to go across 
20101221151559.000|20101221151602.000|TR0|the corn belt in the form of snow.  Mostly 
20101221151602.000|20101221151604.000|TR0|north of 40 degrees latitude and then kind 
20101221151604.000|20101221151607.000|TR0|of (INAUDIBLE) wheels, I think the mid 
20101221151607.000|20101221151609.000|TR0|Atlantic, the Delmarva will get  some snow 
20101221151609.000|20101221151612.000|TR0|out of this for Christmas and during 
20101221151612.000|20101221151614.000|TR0|Christmas travel and New  York and Boston 
20101221151614.000|20101221151617.000|TR0|may get just a little bit, as well.
20101221151617.000|20101221151619.000|TR0|
20101221151619.000|20101221151622.000|TR0|We'll have to update that forecast as we 
20101221151622.000|20101221151624.000|TR0|go through time.  I know a lot of folks 
20101221151624.000|20101221151627.000|TR0|want a white Christmas.  At this point we 
20101221151627.000|20101221151629.000|TR0|may see half the country gets a white  
20101221151629.000|20101221151632.000|TR0|Christmas.  And that's definitely more 
20101221151632.000|20101221151634.000|TR0|than usual and maybe more than people want.
20101221151634.000|20101221151637.000|TR0|
20101221151637.000|20101221151639.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Makes a big difference.  I love 
20101221151639.000|20101221151642.000|TR0|it.  You had some in Oregon, right?     
20101221151642.000|20101221151644.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  Yes, Oregon and the northeast.  
20101221151644.000|20101221151647.000|TR0|It does help to get in the spirit.
20101221151647.000|20101221151649.000|TR0|
20101221151649.000|20101221151652.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   It does.  You freeze your you 
20101221151652.000|20101221151654.000|TR0|know what often.
20101221151654.000|20101221151657.000|TR0|
20101221151657.000|20101221151659.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  You lose some chestnuts.
20101221151659.000|20101221151702.000|TR0|
20101221151702.000|20101221151704.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Oh, my.  Were you star gazing 
20101221151704.000|20101221151707.000|TR0|last night or were you snoozing right 
20101221151707.000|20101221151710.000|TR0|through it?
20101221151710.000|20101221151712.000|TR0|
20101221151712.000|20101221151715.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  I got up to come to work, it 
20101221151715.000|20101221151717.000|TR0|was a little bit cloud covered here.  So I 
20101221151717.000|20101221151720.000|TR0|wasn't disappointed.
20101221151720.000|20101221151722.000|TR0|
20101221151722.000|20101221151725.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, let's talk about this.  
20101221151725.000|20101221151727.000|TR0|The total eclipse of the moon playing out 
20101221151727.000|20101221151730.000|TR0|over North America.  And we're not going 
20101221151730.000|20101221151732.000|TR0|to get it again until 2014?
20101221151732.000|20101221151735.000|TR0|
20101221151735.000|20101221151737.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  Yes, that's the next time 
20101221151737.000|20101221151740.000|TR0|you'll see the total lunar eclipse.  But 
20101221151740.000|20101221151742.000|TR0|the next time it'll happen on the solstice 
20101221151742.000|20101221151745.000|TR0|is like 2090, so another 80 years.
20101221151745.000|20101221151747.000|TR0|
20101221151747.000|20101221151750.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Oh my gosh.
20101221151750.000|20101221151752.000|TR0|
20101221151752.000|20101221151755.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  But in San Francisco they got a 
20101221151755.000|20101221151757.000|TR0|little break in the action there.  KGO 
20101221151757.000|20101221151800.000|TR0|filming that for us and lunar eclipses are 
20101221151800.000|20101221151802.000|TR0|cool. Solar eclipse is even cooler.
20101221151802.000|20101221151805.000|TR0|
20101221151805.000|20101221151807.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  It calls for a song.  We don't 
20101221151807.000|20101221151810.000|TR0|have it.  (INAUDIBLE) You know, the what's 
20101221151810.000|20101221151813.000|TR0|her name song?  I'm not going to - like 
20101221151813.000|20101221151815.000|TR0|I'm going to sing.  Thank you, Rob.
20101221151815.000|20101221151818.000|TR0|
20101221151818.000|20101221151820.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  That's why you got what you are.
20101221151820.000|20101221151823.000|TR0|
20101221151823.000|20101221151825.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  That's right.  That's why I'm 
20101221151825.000|20101221151828.000|TR0|not in showbiz, pal. All right.  
20101221151828.000|20101221151830.000|TR0|Appreciate it.  We'll wait until 2014 and 
20101221151830.000|20101221151833.000|TR0|we'll talk about it again.
20101221151833.000|20101221151835.000|TR0|
20101221151835.000|20101221151838.000|TR0|All right.  A comedian with a medical 
20101221151838.000|20101221151840.000|TR0|problem.  We're going to get the latest on

20101221151903.000|20101221151905.000|TR0|Hammer is joining me.  Even for a 
20101221151905.000|20101221151908.000|TR0|comedian, a transplant is definitely no 
20101221151908.000|20101221151910.000|TR0|joke, A.J..

20101221151913.000|20101221151916.000|TR0|A.J. HAMMER, HOST "SHOWBIZ TONIGHT":  Yes, 
20101221151916.000|20101221151918.000|TR0|Kiran.  No joke is right.  But I am happy 
20101221151918.000|20101221151921.000|TR0|to report Tracy Morgan is recovering 
20101221151921.000|20101221151923.000|TR0|nicely from a kidney transplant.  He 
20101221151923.000|20101221151926.000|TR0|underwent the surgery around December 
20101221151926.000|20101221151928.000|TR0|10th.  He's taking some time off from the 
20101221151928.000|20101221151931.000|TR0|show "30 Rock" to recover. So you can 
20101221151931.000|20101221151933.000|TR0|expect a couple of Tracy-free episodes 
20101221151933.000|20101221151936.000|TR0|next season, but the actor's rep tells us 
20101221151936.000|20101221151938.000|TR0|that Morgan is doing well and he plans to 
20101221151938.000|20101221151941.000|TR0|get back to work just right after the 
20101221151941.000|20101221151943.000|TR0|holidays.     And he has been seen out and 
20101221151943.000|20101221151946.000|TR0|about in New York City lately, including 
20101221151946.000|20101221151948.000|TR0|at a New York Knicks game last Friday.  
20101221151948.000|20101221151951.000|TR0|Morgan was diagnosed with diabetes back in 
20101221151951.000|20101221151953.000|TR0|1996 and remarkably he's the second member 
20101221151953.000|20101221151956.000|TR0|of the "30 Rock" cast to get a  kidney 
20101221151956.000|20101221151958.000|TR0|transplant.  (INAUDIBLE) Chapman who plays 
20101221151958.000|20101221152001.000|TR0|part of Morgan's entourage on the show 
20101221152001.000|20101221152003.000|TR0|also underwent earlier surgery this year.  
20101221152003.000|20101221152006.000|TR0|But we are happy that he's doing well.  I 
20101221152006.000|20101221152008.000|TR0|always liked Tracy Morgan.  Funny, funny 
20101221152008.000|20101221152011.000|TR0|man.
20101221152011.000|20101221152013.000|TR0|
20101221152013.000|20101221152016.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  He is funny.  He's the 
20101221152016.000|20101221152019.000|TR0|highlight of that show.  That's for sure.  
20101221152019.000|20101221152021.000|TR0|He's a lot smarter than he plays.  All 
20101221152021.000|20101221152024.000|TR0|right.  Chris Brown trying to  
20101221152024.000|20101221152026.000|TR0|rehabilitate his image since that domestic 
20101221152026.000|20101221152029.000|TR0|violence arrest. He just took another step 
20101221152029.000|20101221152031.000|TR0|in that direction, apparently?
20101221152031.000|20101221152034.000|TR0|
20101221152034.000|20101221152036.000|TR0|HAMMER:  Yes, Kyra.  By most accounts, 
20101221152036.000|20101221152039.000|TR0|Chris Brown is not just working on his 
20101221152039.000|20101221152041.000|TR0|image, he actually seems now to be working 
20101221152041.000|20101221152044.000|TR0|on his behavior.  Of course, he really 
20101221152044.000|20101221152046.000|TR0|gave a big hit to his reputation and his 
20101221152046.000|20101221152049.000|TR0|life when he brutally beat up then 
20101221152049.000|20101221152051.000|TR0|girlfriend, Rihanna, back in early 2009.
20101221152051.000|20101221152054.000|TR0|
20101221152054.000|20101221152056.000|TR0|But since then he has tried to redeem 
20101221152056.000|20101221152059.000|TR0|himself.  A lot of it was court ordered,  
20101221152059.000|20101221152101.000|TR0|but now Brown is telling his fans that he 
20101221152101.000|20101221152104.000|TR0|just completed a domestic violence class.  
20101221152104.000|20101221152106.000|TR0|He actually tweeted a photo of his diploma 
20101221152106.000|20101221152109.000|TR0|and told his fans he's proud of this 
20101221152109.000|20101221152111.000|TR0|accomplishment.  He tweeted that boys run 
20101221152111.000|20101221152114.000|TR0|from their mistakes and men learn from 
20101221152114.000|20101221152116.000|TR0|them.
20101221152116.000|20101221152119.000|TR0|
20101221152119.000|20101221152122.000|TR0|The class was part of the sentence that he 
20101221152122.000|20101221152124.000|TR0|received after pleading guilty to the  
20101221152124.000|20101221152127.000|TR0|assault.  He does remain on probation 
20101221152127.000|20101221152129.000|TR0|until 2014.  I should point out, Kyra, 
20101221152129.000|20101221152132.000|TR0|that Brown has consistently been praised 
20101221152132.000|20101221152134.000|TR0|by the judge that's been in charge of his 
20101221152134.000|20101221152137.000|TR0|sentence for his work towards 
20101221152137.000|20101221152139.000|TR0|rehabilitation.  So this really may be 
20101221152139.000|20101221152142.000|TR0|more than a case of someone just trying to 
20101221152142.000|20101221152144.000|TR0|fix their image at this point.  And I say 
20101221152144.000|20101221152147.000|TR0|good for him in that case.
20101221152147.000|20101221152149.000|TR0|
20101221152149.000|20101221152152.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Yes, amen.  All right.

20101221152456.000|20101221152458.000|TR0|OK, explain these to me.  Let's start out

20101221152508.000|20101221152511.000|TR0|AUTHOR:  Right.  So number one is very 
20101221152511.000|20101221152513.000|TR0|simple.  And that is you should consider 
20101221152513.000|20101221152516.000|TR0|using a virtual assistant service, if you 
20101221152516.000|20101221152518.000|TR0|can.  And as a real world example, very

20101221152526.000|20101221152528.000|TR0|afternoon or all weekend doing that, she 
20101221152528.000|20101221152531.000|TR0|used asksunday.com, spent $2, they called 
20101221152531.000|20101221152533.000|TR0|every toy store within a 10-mile radius, 
20101221152533.000|20101221152536.000|TR0|AND bought the toy for her, reserved it in 
20101221152536.000|20101221152539.000|TR0|her name, and called her.  So it took her 
20101221152539.000|20101221152541.000|TR0|about 30 seconds to get  that done.  So 
20101221152541.000|20101221152544.000|TR0|that would be number one.
20101221152544.000|20101221152546.000|TR0|
20101221152546.000|20101221152549.000|TR0|CHETRY:  OK.  But that's pretty good.  I 
20101221152549.000|20101221152551.000|TR0|guess still going to the internet is so - 
20101221152551.000|20101221152554.000|TR0|it really helps you with regard to running 
20101221152554.000|20101221152556.000|TR0|around and having to hunt around.  It 
20101221152556.000|20101221152559.000|TR0|really is one of the best tolls to save 
20101221152559.000|20101221152601.000|TR0|tools to saving time.
20101221152601.000|20101221152604.000|TR0|
20101221152604.000|20101221152606.000|TR0|FERRISS:  Absolutely.  And that's actually 
20101221152606.000|20101221152609.000|TR0|a company based in New York, you call two 
20101221152609.000|20101221152611.000|TR0|and two number but then it routes you to 
20101221152611.000|20101221152614.000|TR0|someone in India or the Philippines and it 
20101221152614.000|20101221152616.000|TR0|can be exceptionally, exceptionally 
20101221152616.000|20101221152619.000|TR0|helpful and very inexpensive.
20101221152619.000|20101221152621.000|TR0|
20101221152621.000|20101221152624.000|TR0|The second tip if you'd like me to jump to 
20101221152624.000|20101221152626.000|TR0|that -
20101221152626.000|20101221152629.000|TR0|
20101221152629.000|20101221152631.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Yes.
20101221152631.000|20101221152634.000|TR0|
20101221152634.000|20101221152636.000|TR0|FERRISS:  Would be really minimizing your 
20101221152636.000|20101221152639.000|TR0|feeling of over obligation to connect with 
20101221152639.000|20101221152642.000|TR0|anyone and everyone for the new year or 
20101221152642.000|20101221152644.000|TR0|for the holidays.  And you can use the 
20101221152644.000|20101221152647.000|TR0|80/20 principle, which is very common in 
20101221152647.000|20101221152649.000|TR0|business, also called Pareto's Principle, 
20101221152649.000|20101221152652.000|TR0|to identify the 20 percent of people who 
20101221152652.000|20101221152654.000|TR0|really provide 80 percent or more of the 
20101221152654.000|20101221152657.000|TR0|positive emotions in your life.
20101221152657.000|20101221152659.000|TR0|
20101221152659.000|20101221152702.000|TR0|And it usually ends up being a pretty 
20101221152702.000|20101221152704.000|TR0|short list.  So you can use that to focus 
20101221152704.000|20101221152707.000|TR0|when you're trying to buy gifts for people 
20101221152707.000|20101221152709.000|TR0|or reconnect with people.
20101221152709.000|20101221152712.000|TR0|
20101221152712.000|20101221152714.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   That's hard, you know, you 
20101221152714.000|20101221152717.000|TR0|deal with the guilt factor though, Tim.  
20101221152717.000|20101221152719.000|TR0|You know, a lot of times, well, they kind 
20101221152719.000|20101221152722.000|TR0|of did this and then they're sort -I mean, 
20101221152722.000|20101221152724.000|TR0|that's a hard thing to really  narrow 
20101221152724.000|20101221152727.000|TR0|down, especially during the holidays when 
20101221152727.000|20101221152729.000|TR0|you're feeling a lot more - I don't know, 
20101221152729.000|20101221152732.000|TR0|should we say loving?
20101221152732.000|20101221152734.000|TR0|
20101221152734.000|20101221152737.000|TR0|FERRISS:  No, it's true.  It is.  It can 
20101221152737.000|20101221152739.000|TR0|be challenging, but I think that's also a 
20101221152739.000|20101221152742.000|TR0|source of overwhelm for people.  So if 
20101221152742.000|20101221152745.000|TR0|that applies to them I think it could be a 
20101221152745.000|20101221152747.000|TR0|useful exercise.
20101221152747.000|20101221152750.000|TR0|
20101221152750.000|20101221152752.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   All right.  Number three, when 
20101221152752.000|20101221152755.000|TR0|gifting, don't wrap?
20101221152755.000|20101221152757.000|TR0|
20101221152757.000|20101221152800.000|TR0|FERRISS:  So the holidays isn't all about 
20101221152800.000|20101221152802.000|TR0|efficiency, but I know at least for a 
20101221152802.000|20101221152805.000|TR0|number of my friends who work here in New 
20101221152805.000|20101221152807.000|TR0|York City and bankers or ad agencies, they 
20101221152807.000|20101221152810.000|TR0|have a lot of trouble wrapping their 
20101221152810.000|20101221152812.000|TR0|gifts.  So you could consider a service 
20101221152812.000|20101221152815.000|TR0|like Amazon prime, which will do two-day 
20101221152815.000|20101221152817.000|TR0|delivery and do that wrapping for you.  
20101221152817.000|20101221152820.000|TR0|And one trick that you can use is to 
20101221152820.000|20101221152822.000|TR0|actually have the gifts mailed to you 
20101221152822.000|20101221152825.000|TR0|using a middle initial that indicates who 
20101221152825.000|20101221152827.000|TR0|the gift is for so you don't forget who 
20101221152827.000|20101221152830.000|TR0|it's for and in that way, you can at least 
20101221152830.000|20101221152832.000|TR0|do the cards yourself.  Oh, wow.  So that 
20101221152832.000|20101221152835.000|TR0|would be one approach to saving time.
20101221152835.000|20101221152837.000|TR0|
20101221152837.000|20101221152840.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Not a bad idea.
20101221152840.000|20101221152842.000|TR0|
20101221152842.000|20101221152845.000|TR0|FERRISS:  But also adding the personal 
20101221152845.000|20101221152848.000|TR0|touch.
20101221152848.000|20101221152850.000|TR0|
20101221152850.000|20101221152853.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, exactly.  Because you 
20101221152853.000|20101221152855.000|TR0|don't want to lose that. That is one of 
20101221152855.000|20101221152858.000|TR0|the most important things if you really 
20101221152858.000|20101221152900.000|TR0|want to give somebody something that is  
20101221152900.000|20101221152903.000|TR0|personal and thoughtful.  You don't just 
20101221152903.000|20101221152905.000|TR0|go online and order something and have it 
20101221152905.000|20101221152908.000|TR0|wrapped, right?
20101221152908.000|20101221152910.000|TR0|
20101221152910.000|20101221152913.000|TR0|FERRISS:  Right.  You don't want to have a 
20101221152913.000|20101221152915.000|TR0|typewritten letter for every single gift.  
20101221152915.000|20101221152918.000|TR0|So to encourage people to at least make 
20101221152918.000|20101221152920.000|TR0|the cards personalized.  But you can save 
20101221152920.000|20101221152923.000|TR0|yourself the trouble of the gift wrapping..
20101221152923.000|20101221152925.000|TR0|
20101221152925.000|20101221152928.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   All right.  Number four, hire 
20101221152928.000|20101221152930.000|TR0|help.  Yes, that's right if you've got the 
20101221152930.000|20101221152933.000|TR0|money, but it's a bad economy.
20101221152933.000|20101221152935.000|TR0|
20101221152935.000|20101221152938.000|TR0|FERRISS:  It is a bad economy, which also 
20101221152938.000|20101221152940.000|TR0|means that there are a lot of people 
20101221152940.000|20101221152943.000|TR0|available to help very inexpensively.  So 
20101221152943.000|20101221152945.000|TR0|if you make $40,000 a year, let's say, you 
20101221152945.000|20101221152948.000|TR0|take the first two numbers and cut it in 
20101221152948.000|20101221152951.000|TR0|half and that's how much you make per 
20101221152951.000|20101221152953.000|TR0|hour, so you make $20 an hour.     And in 
20101221152953.000|20101221152956.000|TR0|that case, does it make sense to go on - 
20101221152956.000|20101221152958.000|TR0|let's say, Craigslist, to find someone 
20101221152958.000|20101221153001.000|TR0|help you with the holiday party for $10 an 
20101221153001.000|20101221153003.000|TR0|hour?  I think the answer is yes because 
20101221153003.000|20101221153006.000|TR0|you don't want to be spending your time 
20101221153006.000|20101221153008.000|TR0|managing that.  You want to be spending 
20101221153008.000|20101221153011.000|TR0|your time managing that.  You want to be 
20101221153011.000|20101221153013.000|TR0|spending your time enjoying that.  And you 
20101221153013.000|20101221153016.000|TR0|could also use a service like task 
20101221153016.000|20101221153018.000|TR0|rabbit.com which also would help you find 
20101221153018.000|20101221153021.000|TR0|a very inexpensively to help with the 
20101221153021.000|20101221153023.000|TR0|miscellaneous that have to be dealt with 
20101221153023.000|20101221153026.000|TR0|during the holidays.
20101221153026.000|20101221153028.000|TR0|
20101221153028.000|20101221153031.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   Finally, number five, this is 
20101221153031.000|20101221153033.000|TR0|something we should do all year  round.  
20101221153033.000|20101221153036.000|TR0|Give karma.
20101221153036.000|20101221153038.000|TR0|
20101221153038.000|20101221153041.000|TR0|FERRISS:  Absolutely.  So looking at 
20101221153041.000|20101221153043.000|TR0|customer service, satisfaction, and the 
20101221153043.000|20101221153046.000|TR0|receipt of gifts, you find that opposed to 
20101221153046.000|20101221153048.000|TR0|regular gift cards or even regular  gifts 
20101221153048.000|20101221153051.000|TR0|cards or even regular gifts, giving cards 
20101221153051.000|20101221153054.000|TR0|to philanthropist has the highest 
20101221153054.000|20101221153056.000|TR0|satisfaction rate.
20101221153056.000|20101221153059.000|TR0|
20101221153059.000|20101221153101.000|TR0|Crate and Barrel has looked at this, many 
20101221153101.000|20101221153104.000|TR0|companies have looked at it.  So, you can 
20101221153104.000|20101221153106.000|TR0|get a gift card to a nonprofit like Donors 
20101221153106.000|20101221153109.000|TR0|Choose.org, which helps high-need public 
20101221153109.000|20101221153111.000|TR0|schools in the U.S. and then give that to 
20101221153111.000|20101221153114.000|TR0|someone as a gift.  And they should be 
20101221153114.000|20101221153116.000|TR0|very, very happy to receive it.  And 
20101221153116.000|20101221153119.000|TR0|they'll get a lot of karma back from it, 
20101221153119.000|20101221153121.000|TR0|not just a temporary sugar high from the 
20101221153121.000|20101221153124.000|TR0|gift itself.
20101221153124.000|20101221153126.000|TR0|
20101221153126.000|20101221153129.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  There you go.  "The 4-Hour 
20101221153129.000|20101221153131.000|TR0|Workweek" is the best selling book.  Boy, 
20101221153131.000|20101221153134.000|TR0|I wish I could figure out how to do.  Tim 
20101221153134.000|20101221153136.000|TR0|Ferriss tells you how to do it.  He's also 
20101221153136.000|20101221153139.000|TR0|a speaker and expert on time management.
20101221153139.000|20101221153141.000|TR0|
20101221153141.000|20101221153144.000|TR0|Tim, I don't know how you came up with all 
20101221153144.000|20101221153146.000|TR0|of this wisdom at such a young age, but 
20101221153146.000|20101221153149.000|TR0|it's very impressive.  Thanks for sharing 
20101221153149.000|20101221153151.000|TR0|some of it today.
20101221153151.000|20101221153154.000|TR0|
20101221153154.000|20101221153157.000|TR0|FERRISS:  Thank you for having me.
20101221153157.000|20101221153159.000|TR0|
20101221153159.000|20101221153202.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  You bet.
20101221153202.000|20101221153204.000|TR0|
20101221153204.000|20101221153207.000|TR0|Well, most of us are getting ready for a 
20101221153207.000|20101221153209.000|TR0|little time off, but before you leave 
20101221153209.000|20101221153212.000|TR0|work, should you give a gift to your boss? 
20101221153212.000|20101221153214.000|TR0| Is that a good idea?  Stephanie Elam has 
20101221153214.000|20101221153217.000|TR0|some hints on that for this holiday season.
20101221153217.000|20101221153219.000|TR0|
20101221153219.000|20101221153222.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20101221153222.000|20101221153224.000|TR0|
20101221153224.000|20101221153227.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  Stock market 
20101221153227.000|20101221153229.000|TR0|opening bell rang just about an hour ago.  
20101221153229.000|20101221153232.000|TR0|Checking the numbers.  Dow Industrials up 
20101221153232.000|20101221153234.000|TR0|almost 50 points.

20101221153237.000|20101221153239.000|TR0|Christmas cheer is making a comeback at 
20101221153239.000|20101221153242.000|TR0|the office.  New survey finds that more 
20101221153242.000|20101221153244.000|TR0|employers intend to offer holiday perks 
20101221153244.000|20101221153247.000|TR0|like bonuses, parties, and gifts this 
20101221153247.000|20101221153249.000|TR0|year.  And speaking of your boss, you may 
20101221153249.000|20101221153252.000|TR0|want to send yours a greeting card.  It 
20101221153252.000|20101221153254.000|TR0|could land you that promotion.
20101221153254.000|20101221153257.000|TR0|
20101221153257.000|20101221153300.000|TR0|Stephanie Elam, are you serious?  Don't 
20101221153300.000|20101221153302.000|TR0|bosses know that's just kissing up?
20101221153302.000|20101221153305.000|TR0|
20101221153305.000|20101221153307.000|TR0|STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN BUSINESS 
20101221153307.000|20101221153310.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Maybe they do, maybe they 
20101221153310.000|20101221153312.000|TR0|like it.  Maybe that's just the thing.
20101221153312.000|20101221153315.000|TR0|
20101221153315.000|20101221153317.000|TR0|PHILLIPS: Maybe that's the point.
20101221153317.000|20101221153320.000|TR0|
20101221153320.000|20101221153322.000|TR0|ELAM:  Maybe that's the whole thing about 
20101221153322.000|20101221153325.000|TR0|it.  But when you think about the holiday 
20101221153325.000|20101221153327.000|TR0|parties, maybe that's the boss' way of 
20101221153327.000|20101221153330.000|TR0|kissing up to their employees and letting 
20101221153330.000|20101221153332.000|TR0|them know they really do appreciate all 
20101221153332.000|20101221153335.000|TR0|the work they do all year long and realize 
20101221153335.000|20101221153337.000|TR0|a little holiday merriment could go a long 
20101221153337.000|20101221153340.000|TR0|way.
20101221153340.000|20101221153342.000|TR0|
20101221153342.000|20101221153345.000|TR0|So, let's take a look at this Career 
20101221153345.000|20101221153347.000|TR0|Builder survey and what what people are 
20101221153347.000|20101221153350.000|TR0|planning on doing this year.  Bonuses, as 
20101221153350.000|20101221153352.000|TR0|far as that's going, companies giving 
20101221153352.000|20101221153355.000|TR0|bonuses.  A third plan to give holiday 
20101221153355.000|20101221153357.000|TR0|bonuses this year.  Among them, 59 percent 
20101221153357.000|20101221153400.000|TR0|will give the same amount as they did 
20101221153400.000|20101221153402.000|TR0|before this year.  Nine percent not giving 
20101221153402.000|20101221153405.000|TR0|any at all.
20101221153405.000|20101221153408.000|TR0|
20101221153408.000|20101221153410.000|TR0|Companies throwing holiday parties, that's 
20101221153410.000|20101221153413.000|TR0|up. 52 percent of companies saying they're 
20101221153413.000|20101221153415.000|TR0|going to do.  70 percent saying it's going 
20101221153415.000|20101221153418.000|TR0|to be the same party, and 8 percent aren't 
20101221153418.000|20101221153420.000|TR0|throwing one, even though they used to.
20101221153420.000|20101221153423.000|TR0|
20101221153423.000|20101221153425.000|TR0|And then companies are also giving gifts 
20101221153425.000|20101221153428.000|TR0|to their employees. About a third of 
20101221153428.000|20101221153430.000|TR0|companies there.  Six percent aren't 
20101221153430.000|20101221153433.000|TR0|giving gifts even though they used to.  
20101221153433.000|20101221153435.000|TR0|Some seeing it a little bit tough.
20101221153435.000|20101221153438.000|TR0|
20101221153438.000|20101221153440.000|TR0|But the other thing I think is interesting 
20101221153440.000|20101221153443.000|TR0|here too is that 45 percent of the 
20101221153443.000|20101221153445.000|TR0|companies say they're going to give to 
20101221153445.000|20101221153448.000|TR0|charities as they have done in the past.  
20101221153448.000|20101221153450.000|TR0|So, they know this is a good morale boost, 
20101221153450.000|20101221153453.000|TR0|Kyra, and it can make people feel 
20101221153453.000|20101221153455.000|TR0|appreciated after what have been for most 
20101221153455.000|20101221153458.000|TR0|companies a really rough year.
20101221153458.000|20101221153500.000|TR0|
20101221153500.000|20101221153503.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes.  And you know, if the 
20101221153503.000|20101221153505.000|TR0|bosses are in a giving mood, it might not 
20101221153505.000|20101221153508.000|TR0|be a bad idea to give them something too, 
20101221153508.000|20101221153511.000|TR0|right?
20101221153511.000|20101221153513.000|TR0|
20101221153513.000|20101221153516.000|TR0|ELAM:  Yes.  Exactly.  You may not want to 
20101221153516.000|20101221153518.000|TR0|go overboard, but a simple greeting card 
20101221153518.000|20101221153521.000|TR0|can go a long way, it turns out.  In fact, 
20101221153521.000|20101221153523.000|TR0|according to Allison and Taylor, which is 
20101221153523.000|20101221153526.000|TR0|our reference checking firm, they say that 
20101221153526.000|20101221153528.000|TR0|they found out that people who get cards 
20101221153528.000|20101221153531.000|TR0|from previous employees or current 
20101221153531.000|20101221153533.000|TR0|employees are more likely to do business 
20101221153533.000|20101221153536.000|TR0|with that person or that company in the 
20101221153536.000|20101221153538.000|TR0|future.  It kind of lingers in their mind, 
20101221153538.000|20101221153541.000|TR0|they remember it.  And so it goes a long 
20101221153541.000|20101221153543.000|TR0|way for them.
20101221153543.000|20101221153546.000|TR0|
20101221153546.000|20101221153548.000|TR0|In a 2008 survey, 50 percent of people 
20101221153548.000|20101221153551.000|TR0|said they would be likely to do business.  
20101221153551.000|20101221153553.000|TR0|So, it just gives you an idea there.  It's 
20101221153553.000|20101221153556.000|TR0|really a good way to set yourself apart.  
20101221153556.000|20101221153558.000|TR0|You can stay connected with an old boss in 
20101221153558.000|20101221153601.000|TR0|the event that if a job opens up, hey, he 
20101221153601.000|20101221153603.000|TR0|remembers you.  And then you can show it 
20101221153603.000|20101221153606.000|TR0|to your former boss that you can nurture 
20101221153606.000|20101221153608.000|TR0|these business relationships.  You know 
20101221153608.000|20101221153611.000|TR0|how to handle yourself in business 
20101221153611.000|20101221153614.000|TR0|settings.  So, that's another good thing 
20101221153614.000|20101221153616.000|TR0|to think about.
20101221153616.000|20101221153619.000|TR0|
20101221153619.000|20101221153621.000|TR0|But also what's interesting about this 
20101221153621.000|20101221153624.000|TR0|too, Kyra, this reference checking firm 
20101221153624.000|20101221153626.000|TR0|saying that when they go to check 
20101221153626.000|20101221153629.000|TR0|references, half of the references 
20101221153629.000|20101221153631.000|TR0|actually have negative input about the 
20101221153631.000|20101221153634.000|TR0|person that they're doing the referral 
20101221153634.000|20101221153636.000|TR0|about.  Isn't that crazy?  Half of them 
20101221153636.000|20101221153639.000|TR0|had something negative to say.  You really 
20101221153639.000|20101221153641.000|TR0|need to check your references. I'm going 
20101221153641.000|20101221153644.000|TR0|to have you do them all.       PHILLIPS:  
20101221153644.000|20101221153646.000|TR0|Exactly.  Heck yes!  You send them all my 
20101221153646.000|20101221153649.000|TR0|way, sister. You'll get whatever you need. 
20101221153649.000|20101221153651.000|TR0| Darn right.  I write good letters of rec. 
20101221153651.000|20101221153654.000|TR0| But I don't want you going anywhere.  I 
20101221153654.000|20101221153656.000|TR0|want you to stay right where you are. And 
20101221153656.000|20101221153659.000|TR0|the boss loves you, too.
20101221153659.000|20101221153701.000|TR0|
20101221153701.000|20101221153704.000|TR0|ELAM:  Well, that's always a good thing.  
20101221153704.000|20101221153706.000|TR0|When the boss loves you, that's a good 
20101221153706.000|20101221153709.000|TR0|thing.  That's what you need in your life.
20101221153709.000|20101221153711.000|TR0|
20101221153711.000|20101221153714.000|TR0|PHILLIPS: Yes. Thanks, Steph.
20101221153714.000|20101221153717.000|TR0|
20101221153717.000|20101221153719.000|TR0|Well, it's a little after 10:30 on the 
20101221153719.000|20101221153722.000|TR0|East, 7:30 out in the West coast.
20101221153722.000|20101221153724.000|TR0|
20101221153724.000|20101221153727.000|TR0|Twenty-two years since a terrorist bomb 
20101221153727.000|20101221153729.000|TR0|brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over 
20101221153729.000|20101221153732.000|TR0|Lockerbie, Scotland.  270 people, mostly 
20101221153732.000|20101221153734.000|TR0|Americans died.  This morning, rather, a 
20101221153734.000|20101221153737.000|TR0|Senate report rips into the release last 
20101221153737.000|20101221153739.000|TR0|year of one of the men -- or the one man 
20101221153739.000|20101221153742.000|TR0|convicted of that bombing.  Remember the 
20101221153742.000|20101221153744.000|TR0|Libyan man supposedly had only three 
20101221153744.000|20101221153747.000|TR0|months to live?  Yes, he's still alive. 
20101221153747.000|20101221153749.000|TR0|Senate report claims that his release from 
20101221153749.000|20101221153752.000|TR0|a Scottish prison was part of a deal that 
20101221153752.000|20101221153754.000|TR0|ensured Britain would keep oil and defense 
20101221153754.000|20101221153757.000|TR0|contracts with Libya.

20101221153759.000|20101221153802.000|TR0|More rain in the forecast today for 
20101221153802.000|20101221153804.000|TR0|Hawaii.  Rain slammed the islands, closing 
20101221153804.000|20101221153807.000|TR0|roads, causing some water main problems.

20101221153809.000|20101221153812.000|TR0|And Arlen Specter is wrapping up 30 years

20101221153814.000|20101221153817.000|TR0|today.  Remember, he was a Republican who 
20101221153817.000|20101221153820.000|TR0|switched parties, then lost in 
20101221153820.000|20101221153822.000|TR0|Pennsylvania's Democratic primary.
20101221153822.000|20101221153825.000|TR0|
20101221153825.000|20101221153827.000|TR0|Well, in just under half an hour, we're 
20101221153827.000|20101221153830.000|TR0|getting our first portrait of the United 
20101221153830.000|20101221153832.000|TR0|States 2010.  Who we are, how fast we're 
20101221153832.000|20101221153835.000|TR0|growing, and how we're changing.  The 
20101221153835.000|20101221153837.000|TR0|first census results will be released at 
20101221153837.000|20101221153840.000|TR0|the top of the hour.  And it's so much 
20101221153840.000|20101221153842.000|TR0|more than facts and figures on a page, by 
20101221153842.000|20101221153845.000|TR0|the way.  For starters, this could have a 
20101221153845.000|20101221153847.000|TR0|huge impact on your representation in D.C.
20101221153847.000|20101221153850.000|TR0|
20101221153850.000|20101221153852.000|TR0|That's where you our Kate Bolduan is live. 
20101221153852.000|20101221153855.000|TR0| Hey, Kate.
20101221153855.000|20101221153857.000|TR0|
20101221153857.000|20101221153900.000|TR0|KATE BOLDUAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Don't 
20101221153900.000|20101221153902.000|TR0|fall asleep.  When we say representation 
20101221153902.000|20101221153905.000|TR0|in D.C., this is actually important and 
20101221153905.000|20101221153907.000|TR0|matters to all of you.  Kyra, as you 
20101221153907.000|20101221153910.000|TR0|mentioned, we're going to get the real, 
20101221153910.000|20101221153912.000|TR0|actual numbers at the top of the hour.  
20101221153912.000|20101221153915.000|TR0|But of course, there are a lot of 
20101221153915.000|20101221153917.000|TR0|estimates out there.  And most estimates 
20101221153917.000|20101221153920.000|TR0|are pointing to the South and the West 
20101221153920.000|20101221153923.000|TR0|being really big winners this census.  And 
20101221153923.000|20101221153925.000|TR0|then the Midwest and the North not faring 
20101221153925.000|20101221153928.000|TR0|as well.
20101221153928.000|20101221153930.000|TR0|
20101221153930.000|20101221153933.000|TR0|Now, before I get to the estimates, I want 
20101221153933.000|20101221153935.000|TR0|to quickly remind our viewers why this is 
20101221153935.000|20101221153938.000|TR0|a big deal.  These population numbers will 
20101221153938.000|20101221153940.000|TR0|very quickly change the political 
20101221153940.000|20101221153943.000|TR0|landscape for the next decade.  The new 
20101221153943.000|20101221153945.000|TR0|numbers will decide congressional 
20101221153945.000|20101221153948.000|TR0|reapportionment, basically how many 
20101221153948.000|20101221153950.000|TR0|congressional seats each state gets.  
20101221153950.000|20101221153953.000|TR0|There's a total of 435 House seats.  And 
20101221153953.000|20101221153955.000|TR0|that divvied up among the states, 
20101221153955.000|20101221153958.000|TR0|depending on how many people live there.  
20101221153958.000|20101221154000.000|TR0|Bigger population, more seats you're going 
20101221154000.000|20101221154003.000|TR0|to get, more representation you have, the 
20101221154003.000|20101221154005.000|TR0|more power in Congress you have.
20101221154005.000|20101221154008.000|TR0|
20101221154008.000|20101221154010.000|TR0|So, Texas is expected actually to be quite 
20101221154010.000|20101221154013.000|TR0|a bit winner, possibly gaining four 
20101221154013.000|20101221154015.000|TR0|congressional seats.  Then Florida could 
20101221154015.000|20101221154018.000|TR0|also be a big winner, gaining two seats.  
20101221154018.000|20101221154020.000|TR0|Other states likely to gain at least a 
20101221154020.000|20101221154023.000|TR0|seat include Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, 
20101221154023.000|20101221154026.000|TR0|South Carolina, Utah, and Washington 
20101221154026.000|20101221154028.000|TR0|state.  You see kind of where those are 
20101221154028.000|20101221154031.000|TR0|all located.
20101221154031.000|20101221154033.000|TR0|
20101221154033.000|20101221154036.000|TR0|Well then, there are states like Ohio and 
20101221154036.000|20101221154038.000|TR0|New York which could, unfortunately, be 
20101221154038.000|20101221154041.000|TR0|the losers in this game, if we call it a 
20101221154041.000|20101221154043.000|TR0|game. Dropping maybe two seats.  Other 
20101221154043.000|20101221154046.000|TR0|states likely to lose seats are Illinois, 
20101221154046.000|20101221154048.000|TR0|Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
20101221154048.000|20101221154051.000|TR0|Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.  
20101221154051.000|20101221154053.000|TR0|They may also each lose a seat.  In all, 
20101221154053.000|20101221154056.000|TR0|we could see movement that's estimated in 
20101221154056.000|20101221154058.000|TR0|about 17 states.  So, this is really 
20101221154058.000|20101221154101.000|TR0|important as we're looking ahead, Kyra.
20101221154101.000|20101221154103.000|TR0|
20101221154103.000|20101221154106.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  OK.  What is the initial read 
20101221154106.000|20101221154108.000|TR0|on what this means politically?  I mean, 
20101221154108.000|20101221154111.000|TR0|that's your beat.
20101221154111.000|20101221154113.000|TR0|
20101221154113.000|20101221154116.000|TR0|BOULDUAN:  That's right!  I mean, that's 
20101221154116.000|20101221154118.000|TR0|really what's important, right?  It 
20101221154118.000|20101221154121.000|TR0|appears when you see where they land on 
20101221154121.000|20101221154123.000|TR0|the map, it appears the Republicans are 
20101221154123.000|20101221154126.000|TR0|gaining the most advantage here from the 
20101221154126.000|20101221154129.000|TR0|new numbers.  And that's because most of 
20101221154129.000|20101221154131.000|TR0|the states that are seeing these 
20101221154131.000|20101221154134.000|TR0|population increases are likely Republican 
20101221154134.000|20101221154136.000|TR0|leaning states.  And Republicans, 
20101221154136.000|20101221154139.000|TR0|remember, also made pretty big gains in 
20101221154139.000|20101221154141.000|TR0|the midterms in governorships and state 
20101221154141.000|20101221154144.000|TR0|legislatures.  These are the people who 
20101221154144.000|20101221154146.000|TR0|control the redistricting process that 
20101221154146.000|20101221154149.000|TR0|will be now the big fight ahead.
20101221154149.000|20101221154151.000|TR0|
20101221154151.000|20101221154154.000|TR0|Also, these numbers have an impact on the 
20101221154154.000|20101221154156.000|TR0|electoral college.  So the road to the 
20101221154156.000|20101221154159.000|TR0|White House isn't safe, as well.  That's 
20101221154159.000|20101221154201.000|TR0|changing and shifting as we see these 
20101221154201.000|20101221154204.000|TR0|numbers come out.  Gains in Republican- 
20101221154204.000|20101221154206.000|TR0|leaning states may help Republicans as 
20101221154206.000|20101221154209.000|TR0|they prepare to take on an election bid 
20101221154209.000|20101221154211.000|TR0|from President Obama.

20101221154214.000|20101221154216.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  Kate Bolduan, 
20101221154216.000|20101221154219.000|TR0|appreciate it.

20101221154247.000|20101221154249.000|TR0|Christmas.  Many of those in Europe are 
20101221154249.000|20101221154252.000|TR0|simply dreaming of simply getting home.  
20101221154252.000|20101221154254.000|TR0|Trains, planes, automobiles, all at the

20101221154309.000|20101221154312.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT: It's really bad, Kyra.  So 
20101221154312.000|20101221154314.000|TR0|there's a lot of people having a white 
20101221154314.000|20101221154317.000|TR0|Christmas inside an airport terminal, 
20101221154317.000|20101221154319.000|TR0|especially if you're stuck in London right 
20101221154319.000|20101221154322.000|TR0|now. Heathrow is really bad at this point 
20101221154322.000|20101221154324.000|TR0|in time.  There are people who have been 
20101221154324.000|20101221154327.000|TR0|stuck inside the terminal building, 
20101221154327.000|20101221154329.000|TR0|stranded there since Saturday.  Right now 
20101221154329.000|20101221154332.000|TR0|about one-third of flights operating out 
20101221154332.000|20101221154334.000|TR0|of Heathrow are actually leaving.  So, 
20101221154334.000|20101221154337.000|TR0|there are a lot of people, especially 
20101221154337.000|20101221154340.000|TR0|Americans, who are stranded there, as 
20101221154340.000|20101221154342.000|TR0|well.  Of course, that is usually the 
20101221154342.000|20101221154345.000|TR0|airport Americans use if they want to 
20101221154345.000|20101221154347.000|TR0|travel around Europe or make the hop to 
20101221154347.000|20101221154350.000|TR0|Asia.

20101221154352.000|20101221154355.000|TR0|Looking at continental Europe, things are 
20101221154355.000|20101221154357.000|TR0|a little bit better. Frankfurt is sort of 
20101221154357.000|20101221154400.000|TR0|picking up again.  However, it was closed 
20101221154400.000|20101221154402.000|TR0|for several hours throughout the night 
20101221154402.000|20101221154405.000|TR0|because of heavy snowfall.  It is a 
20101221154405.000|20101221154407.000|TR0|massive snow band that's going across 
20101221154407.000|20101221154410.000|TR0|Europe.  Disrupting traffic, both on the 
20101221154410.000|20101221154412.000|TR0|ground and in the air, of course, as well. 
20101221154412.000|20101221154415.000|TR0| Airports in France, Belgium, Germany, and 
20101221154415.000|20101221154417.000|TR0|England, of course.  Pretty much out of 
20101221154417.000|20101221154420.000|TR0|commission for a very long time this 
20101221154420.000|20101221154422.000|TR0|weekend and those disruptions are 
20101221154422.000|20101221154425.000|TR0|continuing.  So, the advice is if you 
20101221154425.000|20101221154427.000|TR0|don't have to travel to Europe, don't do 
20101221154427.000|20101221154430.000|TR0|it, Kyra.
20101221154430.000|20101221154432.000|TR0|
20101221154432.000|20101221154435.000|TR0|PHILLIPS: Okay.  Advice taken.  Fred,

20101221154633.000|20101221154636.000|TR0|STEINHAUSER:  Let's look at this.  Live.  
20101221154636.000|20101221154638.000|TR0|This is CNN/Opinion Research Corporation 
20101221154638.000|20101221154641.000|TR0|is the national survey.  And right off the 
20101221154641.000|20101221154643.000|TR0|bat, we asked that question.  Do you think 
20101221154643.000|20101221154646.000|TR0|the Senate should approve this weapons 
20101221154646.000|20101221154649.000|TR0|reduction treaty with Moscow?  And take a 
20101221154649.000|20101221154651.000|TR0|look at that, nearly 3 out of 4 in our 
20101221154651.000|20101221154654.000|TR0|poll, 73 percent say, yes, the senators 
20101221154654.000|20101221154656.000|TR0|should approve the treaty; 24 percent say 
20101221154656.000|20101221154659.000|TR0|no.       And Kyra, the big question is 
20101221154659.000|20101221154701.000|TR0|will there be enough Republicans in the 
20101221154701.000|20101221154704.000|TR0|Senate to approve the treaty?  So we broke 
20101221154704.000|20101221154706.000|TR0|it down by party across the country.  You 
20101221154706.000|20101221154709.000|TR0|can see at the top there, Democrats 
20101221154709.000|20101221154711.000|TR0|overwhelmingly across the country, the 
20101221154711.000|20101221154714.000|TR0|poll indicates a proof of the treaty. 
20101221154714.000|20101221154716.000|TR0|Independents, yes, three out of four.  
20101221154716.000|20101221154719.000|TR0|Republicans - slight majority seems almost 
20101221154719.000|20101221154721.000|TR0|divided, 50 percent say, yes, the Senate 
20101221154721.000|20101221154724.000|TR0|should approve the treaty, 45 percent say 
20101221154724.000|20101221154726.000|TR0|no, they should not.  Kyra?
20101221154726.000|20101221154729.000|TR0|
20101221154729.000|20101221154731.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  So, do Americans think that 
20101221154731.000|20101221154734.000|TR0|Moscow would live up to the treaty 
20101221154734.000|20101221154736.000|TR0|obligations if the accord is approved?
20101221154736.000|20101221154739.000|TR0|
20101221154739.000|20101221154741.000|TR0|STEINHAUSER:  Yes, this is really 
20101221154741.000|20101221154744.000|TR0|interesting.  Another question we asked in 
20101221154744.000|20101221154746.000|TR0|the poll.  And you can see the number 
20101221154746.000|20101221154749.000|TR0|here.  A majority say, yes, if this is 
20101221154749.000|20101221154752.000|TR0|apporved, 56 percent think that Russians 
20101221154752.000|20101221154754.000|TR0|will live up to the obligations in the 
20101221154754.000|20101221154757.000|TR0|treaty.

20101221154759.000|20101221154802.000|TR0|And this is a little different.  Our

20101221154804.000|20101221154807.000|TR0|me than from the last time we went through 
20101221154807.000|20101221154809.000|TR0|one of these treaties earlier in the 
20101221154809.000|20101221154812.000|TR0|decade, when back in those days,  a 
20101221154812.000|20101221154814.000|TR0|minority of Americans thought Moscow would 
20101221154814.000|20101221154817.000|TR0|live up to the accord.  Kyra?
20101221154817.000|20101221154819.000|TR0|
20101221154819.000|20101221154822.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  Paul, thanks.

20101221154832.000|20101221154834.000|TR0|After the real estate bubble burst in 
20101221154834.000|20101221154837.000|TR0|2007, Bank of America promised to help its 
20101221154837.000|20101221154839.000|TR0|borrowers struggling with their home 
20101221154839.000|20101221154842.000|TR0|loans.  But Arizona's attorney general 
20101221154842.000|20101221154844.000|TR0|doesn't think that happened.  In a new 
20101221154844.000|20101221154847.000|TR0|lawsuit, Terry Goddard accuses the 
20101221154847.000|20101221154849.000|TR0|nation's largest bank of mortgage fraud.  
20101221154849.000|20101221154852.000|TR0|Last night on "PARKER SPITZER," he told 
20101221154852.000|20101221154855.000|TR0|the story of a retired woman who asked B

20101221154907.000|20101221154910.000|TR0|TERRY GODDARD, ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL: 
20101221154910.000|20101221154912.000|TR0|Through that procedure which dragged on 
20101221154912.000|20101221154915.000|TR0|for over a year, she heard nothing from 
20101221154915.000|20101221154917.000|TR0|the bank until finally she got an eviction 
20101221154917.000|20101221154920.000|TR0|notice. Well, you might wonder exactly how 
20101221154920.000|20101221154922.000|TR0|could that happen. And she's wondering the 
20101221154922.000|20101221154925.000|TR0|same thing right now. She was thrown out 
20101221154925.000|20101221154927.000|TR0|of her house. And her house is still empty 
20101221154927.000|20101221154930.000|TR0|almost a year later.
20101221154930.000|20101221154932.000|TR0|
20101221154932.000|20101221154935.000|TR0|So, the bottom line here was somebody who 
20101221154935.000|20101221154937.000|TR0|made an application for modification, she 
20101221154937.000|20101221154940.000|TR0|had missed one payment through a fraud 
20101221154940.000|20101221154942.000|TR0|that was perpetrated on her.  But that was 
20101221154942.000|20101221154945.000|TR0|not justification, at least in my opinion, 
20101221154945.000|20101221154947.000|TR0|for a foreclosure and an eviction.  But 
20101221154947.000|20101221154950.000|TR0|now she's on the street -- or in rental 
20101221154950.000|20101221154952.000|TR0|housing, and she lost her house.
20101221154952.000|20101221154955.000|TR0|
20101221154955.000|20101221154958.000|TR0|And she's just one of many where they 
20101221154958.000|20101221155000.000|TR0|processed the foreclosure at the same 
20101221155000.000|20101221155003.000|TR0|time, the so-called dual track that they 
20101221155003.000|20101221155005.000|TR0|were doing a modification.  They kept 
20101221155005.000|20101221155008.000|TR0|leading people on, often completely 
20101221155008.000|20101221155010.000|TR0|without justification saying they were 
20101221155010.000|20101221155013.000|TR0|going to get a modification, and then 
20101221155013.000|20101221155015.000|TR0|threw them out to the curb.
20101221155015.000|20101221155018.000|TR0|
20101221155018.000|20101221155020.000|TR0|This is the kind of just very strange and 
20101221155020.000|20101221155023.000|TR0|nontransparent procedures that seem to be 
20101221155023.000|20101221155025.000|TR0|typical of Bank of America.

20101221155708.000|20101221155711.000|TR0|MOOS:  There was the time Naomi Campbell
