20101221140007.000|20101221140009.000|TR0|KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR:  Hey, guys.  
20101221140009.000|20101221140011.000|TR0|And I'm writing down the information 
20101221140011.000|20101221140014.000|TR0|because you've got more than I have.  So 
20101221140014.000|20101221140016.000|TR0|thank you very much.  Have a great rest of 
20101221140016.000|20101221140019.000|TR0|the day.
20101221140019.000|20101221140021.000|TR0|
20101221140021.000|20101221140023.000|TR0|It's 9:00 a.m. on the East Coast, 6:00 
20101221140023.000|20101221140026.000|TR0|a.m. out West.  Here's some of the stories 
20101221140026.000|20101221140028.000|TR0|that have us talking this is morning.
20101221140028.000|20101221140031.000|TR0|
20101221140031.000|20101221140033.000|TR0|We're following a developing story off the 
20101221140033.000|20101221140036.000|TR0|coast of Puerto Rico, as well.  A National 
20101221140036.000|20101221140038.000|TR0|Guard helicopter has crashed into the 
20101221140038.000|20101221140040.000|TR0|ocean with six people aboard.  At least 
20101221140040.000|20101221140043.000|TR0|one person confirmed dead.  The search for 
20101221140043.000|20101221140045.000|TR0|possible survivors still continuing.
20101221140045.000|20101221140048.000|TR0|
20101221140048.000|20101221140050.000|TR0|And in just a couple of hours we're going 
20101221140050.000|20101221140053.000|TR0|to find out how many people live in the 
20101221140053.000|20101221140055.000|TR0|United States and where.  The 2010 census 
20101221140055.000|20101221140057.000|TR0|will show how the country has changed over 
20101221140057.000|20101221140100.000|TR0|the past decade and decide congressional 
20101221140100.000|20101221140102.000|TR0|seats and electoral votes.
20101221140102.000|20101221140105.000|TR0|
20101221140105.000|20101221140107.000|TR0|And did you look in the sky and witness 
20101221140107.000|20101221140109.000|TR0|history this morning?  A total eclipse of 
20101221140109.000|20101221140112.000|TR0|the moon visible across the U.S.  It was 
20101221140112.000|20101221140114.000|TR0|the first total lunar eclipse of the 
20101221140114.000|20101221140117.000|TR0|Winter Solstice in almost 400 years.
20101221140117.000|20101221140119.000|TR0|
20101221140119.000|20101221140122.000|TR0|Now as you just heard from John and Kiran, 
20101221140122.000|20101221140124.000|TR0|a story that we're working out of Rome 
20101221140124.000|20101221140126.000|TR0|right now.  Apparently a bomb was found 
20101221140126.000|20101221140129.000|TR0|underneath a train seat and the newest 
20101221140129.000|20101221140131.000|TR0|information we have the train apparently 
20101221140131.000|20101221140134.000|TR0|was empty.  And it was diffused.
20101221140134.000|20101221140136.000|TR0|
20101221140136.000|20101221140139.000|TR0|It was in the Rome subway where this was 
20101221140139.000|20101221140141.000|TR0|discovered by a train station employee.  
20101221140141.000|20101221140143.000|TR0|Not clear who left it or if it could have 
20101221140143.000|20101221140146.000|TR0|even exploded in -- well, actually now 
20101221140146.000|20101221140148.000|TR0|we're getting this new information that it 
20101221140148.000|20101221140151.000|TR0|was diffused apparently, so we're working 
20101221140151.000|20101221140153.000|TR0|that story for you. We'll bring you more 
20101221140153.000|20101221140156.000|TR0|information as we get it.
20101221140156.000|20101221140158.000|TR0|
20101221140158.000|20101221140200.000|TR0|Well, today officially marks the first day 
20101221140200.000|20101221140203.000|TR0|of winter but that's a laughable 
20101221140203.000|20101221140205.000|TR0|technicality in northern California.  The 
20101221140205.000|20101221140208.000|TR0|Sierra Nevada Mountains are buried under 
20101221140208.000|20101221140210.000|TR0|as much as 10 feet of snow now and by 
20101221140210.000|20101221140212.000|TR0|later today snow could pile 15 feet high.
20101221140212.000|20101221140215.000|TR0|
20101221140215.000|20101221140217.000|TR0|Wind gusts toppled the startling 150 miles 
20101221140217.000|20101221140220.000|TR0|on one summit, Alpine Meadows, and then in 
20101221140220.000|20101221140222.000|TR0|southern California, heavy rains have 
20101221140222.000|20101221140225.000|TR0|caused widespread flooding and a few 
20101221140225.000|20101221140227.000|TR0|mudslides and things could get worse over 
20101221140227.000|20101221140229.000|TR0|the next several days.  Already those 
20101221140229.000|20101221140232.000|TR0|floods have forced the evacuation of 
20101221140232.000|20101221140234.000|TR0|nearly 2,000 people in McFarland and 
20101221140234.000|20101221140237.000|TR0|mudslides have already shut down two 
20101221140237.000|20101221140239.000|TR0|highways.       All right.  Let's get the 
20101221140239.000|20101221140242.000|TR0|latest on this weather in Southern 
20101221140242.000|20101221140244.000|TR0|California.  Our Casey Wian is in Ventura 
20101221140244.000|20101221140246.000|TR0|County, California, for us.
20101221140246.000|20101221140249.000|TR0|
20101221140249.000|20101221140251.000|TR0|Hey, Casey.
20101221140251.000|20101221140254.000|TR0|
20101221140254.000|20101221140256.000|TR0|CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good 
20101221140256.000|20101221140258.000|TR0|morning, Kyra.  You're familiar with 
20101221140258.000|20101221140301.000|TR0|Southern California.
20101221140301.000|20101221140303.000|TR0|
20101221140303.000|20101221140306.000|TR0|I'm just across county line in Ventura 
20101221140306.000|20101221140308.000|TR0|County on Pacific Coast Highway.  And this 
20101221140308.000|20101221140311.000|TR0|stretch of Pacific Coast Highway remains 
20101221140311.000|20101221140313.000|TR0|closed. Twenty-mile section between 
20101221140313.000|20101221140315.000|TR0|Northern Malibu and Oxnard closed because 
20101221140315.000|20101221140318.000|TR0|of a mudslide.  CalTran crews have been -- 
20101221140318.000|20101221140320.000|TR0|CalTrans crews have been working to remove 
20101221140320.000|20101221140323.000|TR0|debris, boulders from the roadway.  But it 
20101221140323.000|20101221140325.000|TR0|still remains closed at this hour.
20101221140325.000|20101221140328.000|TR0|
20101221140328.000|20101221140330.000|TR0|Elsewhere, throughout Southern California, 
20101221140330.000|20101221140332.000|TR0|traffic has been snarled by this heavy 
20101221140332.000|20101221140335.000|TR0|storm, this rain that has continued since 
20101221140335.000|20101221140337.000|TR0|Friday.  California Highway Patrol says in 
20101221140337.000|20101221140340.000|TR0|Los Angeles County yesterday there were 
20101221140340.000|20101221140342.000|TR0|three times as many accidents on L.A. 
20101221140342.000|20101221140345.000|TR0|County roads as you would normally expect 
20101221140345.000|20101221140347.000|TR0|and even with the lighter holiday volume.
20101221140347.000|20101221140349.000|TR0|
20101221140349.000|20101221140352.000|TR0|Elsewhere in the state, as you mentioned, 
20101221140352.000|20101221140354.000|TR0|the community of McFarland -- in central 
20101221140354.000|20101221140357.000|TR0|California, 2,000 residents evacuated 
20101221140357.000|20101221140359.000|TR0|there because a creek overflowed.  Crews 
20101221140359.000|20101221140401.000|TR0|were able to remove debris from that creek 
20101221140401.000|20101221140404.000|TR0|and it's flowing normally again and those 
20101221140404.000|20101221140406.000|TR0|residents were allowed back in their home.
20101221140406.000|20101221140409.000|TR0|
20101221140409.000|20101221140411.000|TR0|And you mentioned the snow and the Sierra 
20101221140411.000|20101221140414.000|TR0|Nevadas.  We actually got some updated 
20101221140414.000|20101221140416.000|TR0|numbers, just checked the Web site of 
20101221140416.000|20101221140418.000|TR0|Mammoth Mountain which a lot of skiers are 
20101221140418.000|20101221140421.000|TR0|familiar with.  And they have received up 
20101221140421.000|20101221140423.000|TR0|the 13.5 feet of snow since Friday.  
20101221140423.000|20101221140426.000|TR0|Really unbelievable. And wind gusts in the 
20101221140426.000|20101221140428.000|TR0|Sierra Nevadas at the higher altitudes had 
20101221140428.000|20101221140431.000|TR0|exceeded 150 miles per hour.
20101221140431.000|20101221140433.000|TR0|
20101221140433.000|20101221140435.000|TR0|We've also got power outages throughout 
20101221140435.000|20101221140438.000|TR0|Southern California, scattered power 
20101221140438.000|20101221140440.000|TR0|outages at this point in time, 20,000 
20101221140440.000|20101221140443.000|TR0|Southern California Edison customers are 
20101221140443.000|20101221140445.000|TR0|reported to be without power.
20101221140445.000|20101221140448.000|TR0|
20101221140448.000|20101221140450.000|TR0|Right now, the rain has subsided a little 
20101221140450.000|20101221140452.000|TR0|bit.  It's just drizzling a little bit.  
20101221140452.000|20101221140455.000|TR0|We're expecting, though, later tonight 
20101221140455.000|20101221140457.000|TR0|much heavier rainfall.  And that's what 
20101221140457.000|20101221140500.000|TR0|we're going to have to see how these 
20101221140500.000|20101221140502.000|TR0|hillsides affected by fires are going to 
20101221140502.000|20101221140504.000|TR0|hold up -- Kyra.
20101221140504.000|20101221140507.000|TR0|
20101221140507.000|20101221140509.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  Casey, we'll keep 
20101221140509.000|20101221140512.000|TR0|talking.  Thank you so much.
20101221140512.000|20101221140514.000|TR0|
20101221140514.000|20101221140517.000|TR0|Well, millions of Californians have no 
20101221140517.000|20101221140519.000|TR0|relief in sight.  In fact things are 
20101221140519.000|20101221140521.000|TR0|likely to get much worse.  That's what 
20101221140521.000|20101221140524.000|TR0|we're getting from our meteorologist Rob 
20101221140524.000|20101221140526.000|TR0|Marciano right now.
20101221140526.000|20101221140529.000|TR0|
20101221140529.000|20101221140531.000|TR0|What do you think?  What can we add to 
20101221140531.000|20101221140534.000|TR0|what Casey is telling us, Rob?
20101221140534.000|20101221140536.000|TR0|
20101221140536.000|20101221140538.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Well, 
20101221140538.000|20101221140541.000|TR0|here's where the -- this tells the whole 
20101221140541.000|20101221140543.000|TR0|story, Kyra, which is the plume continues 
20101221140543.000|20101221140546.000|TR0|to be directed at Southern California.  
20101221140546.000|20101221140548.000|TR0|But this piece of energy is going to kick 
20101221140548.000|20101221140550.000|TR0|out the system.  This is the last surge of 
20101221140550.000|20101221140553.000|TR0|moisture that's going to come through and 
20101221140553.000|20101221140555.000|TR0|then we're getting into a significant 
20101221140555.000|20101221140558.000|TR0|drying trend.
20101221140558.000|20101221140600.000|TR0|
20101221140600.000|20101221140603.000|TR0|That will take 36 hours to happen.  It'll 
20101221140603.000|20101221140605.000|TR0|shut down tomorrow night sometime and then 
20101221140605.000|20101221140607.000|TR0|we'll start to get into some drier air.  
20101221140607.000|20101221140610.000|TR0|Also up here, the popcorn-type of clouds, 
20101221140610.000|20101221140612.000|TR0|that's cold air.  So we're going to see 
20101221140612.000|20101221140615.000|TR0|the snow levels drop and that will help 
20101221140615.000|20101221140617.000|TR0|lock up some of the moisture up in the 
20101221140617.000|20101221140620.000|TR0|mountains, but before that happens we 
20101221140620.000|20101221140622.000|TR0|still have a tremendous amount of rainfall 
20101221140622.000|20101221140624.000|TR0|that's going to come through and I fear 
20101221140624.000|20101221140627.000|TR0|that a lot of these hillsides are at their 
20101221140627.000|20101221140629.000|TR0|breaking point.

20101221140649.000|20101221140651.000|TR0|The weather is also making travel pretty 
20101221140651.000|20101221140653.000|TR0|miserable overseas as Europe reels from 
20101221140653.000|20101221140656.000|TR0|its worst snowfall in decades.  Trains are 
20101221140656.000|20101221140658.000|TR0|slowed or altogether stopped and airports 
20101221140658.000|20101221140701.000|TR0|jammed with stranded travelers.

20101221140710.000|20101221140713.000|TR0|So, Fred, what's it like?

20101221140715.000|20101221140718.000|TR0|FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL 
20101221140718.000|20101221140720.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  It's pretty bad, Kyra.
20101221140720.000|20101221140723.000|TR0|
20101221140723.000|20101221140725.000|TR0|I mean if you're looking at London 
20101221140725.000|20101221140727.000|TR0|Heathrow, there's been people who have 
20101221140727.000|20101221140730.000|TR0|been inside that terminal for several days 
20101221140730.000|20101221140732.000|TR0|trying to get out. Of course also a lot of 
20101221140732.000|20101221140735.000|TR0|Americans who are still who are trying to 
20101221140735.000|20101221140737.000|TR0|get back to the U.S. -- for Christmas or 
20101221140737.000|20101221140739.000|TR0|trying to visit their relatives somewhere 
20101221140739.000|20101221140742.000|TR0|else abroad.
20101221140742.000|20101221140744.000|TR0|
20101221140744.000|20101221140747.000|TR0|The situation in the UK especially is 
20101221140747.000|20101221140749.000|TR0|still -- is still very bad. There's still 
20101221140749.000|20101221140752.000|TR0|a lot of snowfall out there.  Only about 
20101221140752.000|20101221140754.000|TR0|one-third of the flights that are going 
20101221140754.000|20101221140756.000|TR0|through London Heathrow, which is of 
20101221140756.000|20101221140759.000|TR0|course the busiest airport here in Europe, 
20101221140759.000|20101221140801.000|TR0|are actually operating.
20101221140801.000|20101221140804.000|TR0|
20101221140804.000|20101221140806.000|TR0|Here in Germany, Frankfurt, airport, also 
20101221140806.000|20101221140809.000|TR0|a lot of disruption there.  There was some 
20101221140809.000|20101221140811.000|TR0|snowfall earlier this morning and the 
20101221140811.000|20101221140813.000|TR0|airport was shut down completely earlier 
20101221140813.000|20101221140816.000|TR0|this morning.  It's open again now.
20101221140816.000|20101221140818.000|TR0|
20101221140818.000|20101221140821.000|TR0|However, also here, hundreds of 
20101221140821.000|20101221140823.000|TR0|cancelations and one thing that our 
20101221140823.000|20101221140826.000|TR0|viewers who are actually thinking of 
20101221140826.000|20101221140828.000|TR0|traveling to Europe need to know is the 
20101221140828.000|20101221140830.000|TR0|big issue here right now is not only 
20101221140830.000|20101221140833.000|TR0|getting here, it's also getting your 
20101221140833.000|20101221140835.000|TR0|luggage here.  A lot of luggage actually 
20101221140835.000|20101221140838.000|TR0|being lost and the airlines are having a 
20101221140838.000|20101221140840.000|TR0|massive trouble tracing that luggage.
20101221140840.000|20101221140842.000|TR0|
20101221140842.000|20101221140845.000|TR0|A lot of it lost three, four, five days, 
20101221140845.000|20101221140847.000|TR0|even up to a week so certainly there's a 
20101221140847.000|20101221140850.000|TR0|lot to look out for right now if you are 
20101221140850.000|20101221140852.000|TR0|thinking to travel here to Europe.  It's a 
20101221140852.000|20101221140855.000|TR0|pretty tough journey -- Kyra.
20101221140855.000|20101221140857.000|TR0|
20101221140857.000|20101221140859.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  OK.  Fred, we'll keep checking 
20101221140859.000|20101221140902.000|TR0|in with you, as well. Appreciate it.       
20101221140902.000|20101221140904.000|TR0|And well before dawn this morning, 
20101221140904.000|20101221140907.000|TR0|stargazers had the eyes on the skies.  A 
20101221140907.000|20101221140909.000|TR0|total eclipse of the moon played out over 
20101221140909.000|20101221140912.000|TR0|North America. It's the first total lunar 
20101221140912.000|20101221140914.000|TR0|eclipse since 2008 but it's even more 
20101221140914.000|20101221140916.000|TR0|noteworthy than that.  It's been nearly 
20101221140916.000|20101221140919.000|TR0|400 years since something like this 
20101221140919.000|20101221140921.000|TR0|happened on the winter solstice.
20101221140921.000|20101221140924.000|TR0|
20101221140924.000|20101221140926.000|TR0|This is the view from iReporter Sheila

20101221140931.000|20101221140933.000|TR0|Sheila, thanks.

20101221140936.000|20101221140938.000|TR0|She actually teaches photography and took 
20101221140938.000|20101221140941.000|TR0|some students out on the all-night shoot.  
20101221140941.000|20101221140943.000|TR0|The next total lunar eclipse will take 
20101221140943.000|20101221140945.000|TR0|place in 2014.
20101221140945.000|20101221140948.000|TR0|
20101221140948.000|20101221140950.000|TR0|President Obama, Vice President Biden and 
20101221140950.000|20101221140953.000|TR0|Secretary of State Hillary Clinton been 
20101221140953.000|20101221140955.000|TR0|working the phones trying to win enough 
20101221140955.000|20101221140958.000|TR0|Republican Senate support to ratify the 
20101221140958.000|20101221141000.000|TR0|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
20101221141000.000|20101221141002.000|TR0|
20101221141002.000|20101221141005.000|TR0|The landmark U.S.-Russian nuclear arms 
20101221141005.000|20101221141007.000|TR0|treaty could come up for a procedural vote 
20101221141007.000|20101221141010.000|TR0|as early as today.  Now Admiral Mike 
20101221141010.000|20101221141012.000|TR0|Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
20101221141012.000|20101221141015.000|TR0|Staff, wrote a letter backing that pact 
20101221141015.000|20101221141017.000|TR0|and that could nudge more senators into 
20101221141017.000|20101221141019.000|TR0|the yes column.
20101221141019.000|20101221141022.000|TR0|
20101221141022.000|20101221141024.000|TR0|From nuclear weapons to your fridge, 
20101221141024.000|20101221141027.000|TR0|Congress is on the verge of giving the 
20101221141027.000|20101221141029.000|TR0|thumbs up to a sweeping food safety bill.  
20101221141029.000|20101221141031.000|TR0|It's aimed at keeping bad food from 
20101221141031.000|20101221141034.000|TR0|entering the supply chain.
20101221141034.000|20101221141036.000|TR0|
20101221141036.000|20101221141039.000|TR0|The legislation would give the Food and 
20101221141039.000|20101221141041.000|TR0|Drug Administration new strength while 
20101221141041.000|20101221141044.000|TR0|imposing tougher rules on production and 
20101221141044.000|20101221141046.000|TR0|trade.  The House is expected to pass that 
20101221141046.000|20101221141048.000|TR0|bill today.
20101221141048.000|20101221141051.000|TR0|
20101221141051.000|20101221141053.000|TR0|And the president's pens are going to be 
20101221141053.000|20101221141056.000|TR0|busy.  He expected to sign the "Don't Ask, 
20101221141056.000|20101221141058.000|TR0|Don't Tell" repeal tomorrow, but the 
20101221141058.000|20101221141101.000|TR0|17-year ban on gay troops serving openly 
20101221141101.000|20101221141103.000|TR0|in the military won't end immediately.
20101221141103.000|20101221141105.000|TR0|
20101221141105.000|20101221141108.000|TR0|The law only changes once the Pentagon 
20101221141108.000|20101221141110.000|TR0|proves to Congress that the military has 
20101221141110.000|20101221141113.000|TR0|met several requirements including troop 
20101221141113.000|20101221141115.000|TR0|education programs.  And the Pentagon 
20101221141115.000|20101221141118.000|TR0|hasn't set a timetable, saying only that 
20101221141118.000|20101221141120.000|TR0|it's moving forward at a deliberate pace.
20101221141120.000|20101221141122.000|TR0|
20101221141122.000|20101221141125.000|TR0|Now you can watch the president signing 
20101221141125.000|20101221141127.000|TR0|the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" repeal 
20101221141127.000|20101221141130.000|TR0|tomorrow morning right here in the CNN

20101221141132.000|20101221141134.000|TR0|
20101221141134.000|20101221141137.000|TR0|Now remember all those census workers 
20101221141137.000|20101221141139.000|TR0|doing their thing last year, taking the 
20101221141139.000|20101221141142.000|TR0|names, the numbers?  Now we're going to 
20101221141142.000|20101221141144.000|TR0|see some fruits of all that labor.  A 
20101221141144.000|20101221141147.000|TR0|first batch of results from the 2010 count 
20101221141147.000|20101221141149.000|TR0|are being released two hours from now.
20101221141149.000|20101221141151.000|TR0|
20101221141151.000|20101221141154.000|TR0|Let's talk a little bit more about that 
20101221141154.000|20101221141156.000|TR0|with Poppy Harlow with CNNMoney.com.
20101221141156.000|20101221141159.000|TR0|
20101221141159.000|20101221141201.000|TR0|So, Poppy, there's a lot at stake here 
20101221141201.000|20101221141204.000|TR0|politically.       POPPY HARLOW, 
20101221141204.000|20101221141206.000|TR0|CNNMONEY.COM:  A lot at stake politically, 
20101221141206.000|20101221141208.000|TR0|a lot when it comes to money for your 
20101221141208.000|20101221141211.000|TR0|state.  None of us wanted to fill out 
20101221141211.000|20101221141213.000|TR0|those forms but today it's going to matter 
20101221141213.000|20101221141216.000|TR0|what those numbers tell us. They come out 
20101221141216.000|20101221141218.000|TR0|at 11:00 a.m., Kyra.
20101221141218.000|20101221141221.000|TR0|
20101221141221.000|20101221141223.000|TR0|It's how more than $400 billion in federal 
20101221141223.000|20101221141225.000|TR0|money is going to be distributed to 
20101221141225.000|20101221141228.000|TR0|states.  It also reallocates seats in the 
20101221141228.000|20101221141230.000|TR0|House, the number of representatives you 
20101221141230.000|20101221141233.000|TR0|have in Congress.
20101221141233.000|20101221141235.000|TR0|
20101221141235.000|20101221141237.000|TR0|Again the numbers at 11:00 a.m.  But what 
20101221141237.000|20101221141240.000|TR0|we want to do is show you the estimates.  
20101221141240.000|20101221141242.000|TR0|We have the estimates from 2000 to 2009.  
20101221141242.000|20101221141245.000|TR0|So it'll be pretty close to this when we 
20101221141245.000|20101221141247.000|TR0|get them at 11:00.
20101221141247.000|20101221141250.000|TR0|
20101221141250.000|20101221141252.000|TR0|Let's take a look at a state like Ohio.  
20101221141252.000|20101221141254.000|TR0|OK?  They have had a very tough economic 
20101221141254.000|20101221141257.000|TR0|situation throughout the past decade.  
20101221141257.000|20101221141259.000|TR0|They could lose the most congressional 
20101221141259.000|20101221141302.000|TR0|seats.  They have only grown 1.7 percent. 
20101221141302.000|20101221141304.000|TR0|They have an unemployment rate of 9.8 
20101221141304.000|20101221141307.000|TR0|percent.  That's the same as the national 
20101221141307.000|20101221141309.000|TR0|average.
20101221141309.000|20101221141311.000|TR0|
20101221141311.000|20101221141314.000|TR0|That state alone has lost 409,000 
20101221141314.000|20101221141316.000|TR0|manufacturing jobs since January of 2000.  
20101221141316.000|20101221141319.000|TR0|That is a 40 percent drop and a key 
20101221141319.000|20101221141321.000|TR0|employer there, General Motors.  We all 
20101221141321.000|20101221141323.000|TR0|know the story there.  They were one of 
20101221141323.000|20101221141326.000|TR0|the biggest employers in the state.  Now 
20101221141326.000|20101221141328.000|TR0|they are the 34th largest employer in the 
20101221141328.000|20101221141331.000|TR0|state.
20101221141331.000|20101221141333.000|TR0|
20101221141333.000|20101221141336.000|TR0|They have cut thousands of jobs in Ohio.  
20101221141336.000|20101221141338.000|TR0|And to top it all off for Ohio, very hard 
20101221141338.000|20101221141340.000|TR0|hit by foreclosures.  The 11th highest 
20101221141340.000|20101221141343.000|TR0|foreclosure rate in the country.
20101221141343.000|20101221141345.000|TR0|
20101221141345.000|20101221141348.000|TR0|Slow growth there in Ohio, but let's also 
20101221141348.000|20101221141350.000|TR0|take a look at North Dakota.  This is sort 
20101221141350.000|20101221141353.000|TR0|of an opposite story.  What it shows us is 
20101221141353.000|20101221141355.000|TR0|that slow growth, Kyra, doesn't 
20101221141355.000|20101221141357.000|TR0|necessarily correlate to high unemployment.
20101221141357.000|20101221141400.000|TR0|
20101221141400.000|20101221141402.000|TR0|North Dakota, .7 percent growth over the 
20101221141402.000|20101221141405.000|TR0|last nine years.  But they have the single 
20101221141405.000|20101221141407.000|TR0|lowest unemployment rate in the country, 
20101221141407.000|20101221141410.000|TR0|3.8 percent.  That is their unemployment 
20101221141410.000|20101221141412.000|TR0|rate.  Why is that?  Clearly a lot of it 
20101221141412.000|20101221141414.000|TR0|comes down to oil.  A huge oil boom there. 
20101221141414.000|20101221141417.000|TR0| Diversified economy, health care, 
20101221141417.000|20101221141419.000|TR0|agriculture.  They've actually added more 
20101221141419.000|20101221141422.000|TR0|than 38,000 jobs since 2000.  That is a 12 
20101221141422.000|20101221141424.000|TR0|percent jump, Kyra.
20101221141424.000|20101221141426.000|TR0|
20101221141426.000|20101221141429.000|TR0|So when you look at growth, that doesn't 
20101221141429.000|20101221141431.000|TR0|necessarily correlate to how good their 
20101221141431.000|20101221141434.000|TR0|economy is when it goes state by state -- 
20101221141434.000|20101221141436.000|TR0|Kyra.
20101221141436.000|20101221141439.000|TR0|
20101221141439.000|20101221141441.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  So what about the 
20101221141441.000|20101221141443.000|TR0|states that have been growing the most?
20101221141443.000|20101221141446.000|TR0|
20101221141446.000|20101221141448.000|TR0|HARLOW:  Yes.
20101221141448.000|20101221141451.000|TR0|
20101221141451.000|20101221141453.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  What's the employment situation 
20101221141453.000|20101221141456.000|TR0|like there?
20101221141456.000|20101221141458.000|TR0|
20101221141458.000|20101221141500.000|TR0|HARLOW:  So take a state like Texas.  
20101221141500.000|20101221141503.000|TR0|That's actually been growing a lot, 18.8 
20101221141503.000|20101221141505.000|TR0|percent growth.  Their unemployment rate, 
20101221141505.000|20101221141508.000|TR0|pretty high, 8.2 percent, still below the 
20101221141508.000|20101221141510.000|TR0|national average.  But what Texas has seen 
20101221141510.000|20101221141512.000|TR0|over the last decade, pretty much, is that 
20101221141512.000|20101221141515.000|TR0|more than a million jobs added.       The 
20101221141515.000|20101221141517.000|TR0|reason is they've got very low corporate 
20101221141517.000|20101221141520.000|TR0|tax rates.  They've got loose government 
20101221141520.000|20101221141522.000|TR0|regulation.  It's a red state.  So 
20101221141522.000|20101221141525.000|TR0|businesses like to operate there.  Low 
20101221141525.000|20101221141527.000|TR0|home prices and also no state income tax.
20101221141527.000|20101221141529.000|TR0|
20101221141529.000|20101221141532.000|TR0|But again similar story here.  Growth 
20101221141532.000|20101221141534.000|TR0|doesn't always mean jobs.
20101221141534.000|20101221141537.000|TR0|
20101221141537.000|20101221141539.000|TR0|Finally, I want to take a look at Nevada.  
20101221141539.000|20101221141542.000|TR0|Nevada, we all know the story there.  They 
20101221141542.000|20101221141544.000|TR0|have grown a whopping 32.3 percent over 
20101221141544.000|20101221141546.000|TR0|the decade.  They have the single highest 
20101221141546.000|20101221141549.000|TR0|unemployment rate in the country, 14.3 
20101221141549.000|20101221141551.000|TR0|percent.
20101221141551.000|20101221141554.000|TR0|
20101221141554.000|20101221141556.000|TR0|The census measures from back in 2000 when 
20101221141556.000|20101221141559.000|TR0|the economy was very good, Nevada was 
20101221141559.000|20101221141601.000|TR0|booming.  The casinos were doing well but 
20101221141601.000|20101221141603.000|TR0|that growth was stunted by the recession.  
20101221141603.000|20101221141606.000|TR0|It was decimated by the housing market.
20101221141606.000|20101221141608.000|TR0|
20101221141608.000|20101221141611.000|TR0|Nevada also grappling with, Kyra, the 
20101221141611.000|20101221141613.000|TR0|highest foreclosure rate in the country.  
20101221141613.000|20101221141615.000|TR0|They lost tens of thousands of jobs in 
20101221141615.000|20101221141618.000|TR0|leisure, hospitality at all those hotels.  
20101221141618.000|20101221141620.000|TR0|So this is probably what the numbers are 
20101221141620.000|20101221141623.000|TR0|going to look like and that is where $400 
20101221141623.000|20101221141625.000|TR0|billion.  That's how it's going to be 
20101221141625.000|20101221141628.000|TR0|allocated.  We'll get those final numbers. 
20101221141628.000|20101221141630.000|TR0| They'll come in here right at 11:00 a.m. 
20101221141630.000|20101221141632.000|TR0|--  Kyra?
20101221141632.000|20101221141635.000|TR0|
20101221141635.000|20101221141637.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  OK.  And we'll bring them to 
20101221141637.000|20101221141640.000|TR0|our viewers.  Thanks, Poppy, so much.
20101221141640.000|20101221141642.000|TR0|
20101221141642.000|20101221141645.000|TR0|HARLOW:  Yes.  You got it.
20101221141645.000|20101221141647.000|TR0|
20101221141647.000|20101221141649.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, nothing says party like 
20101221141649.000|20101221141652.000|TR0|succession.  Some folks in South Carolina 
20101221141652.000|20101221141654.000|TR0|partied like it was 1859 last night.  
20101221141654.000|20101221141657.000|TR0|Well, 1860 to be exact.  Celebrating 150 
20101221141657.000|20101221141659.000|TR0|years since their state was first to leave 
20101221141659.000|20101221141702.000|TR0|the union.  Never mind all that human 
20101221141702.000|20101221141704.000|TR0|bondage, civil war stuff.  Oh, yes.  We're 
20101221141704.000|20101221141706.000|TR0|talking about this coming up next.

20101221141718.000|20101221141721.000|TR0|need the most.  In Huntsville, Alabama,

20101221141848.000|20101221141851.000|TR0|after nearly 5,000 people showed up for an

20101221142454.000|20101221142456.000|TR0|with all those last-minute shopping tips.
20101221142456.000|20101221142459.000|TR0|
20101221142459.000|20101221142501.000|TR0|I'll tell you what.  I had to go to the 
20101221142501.000|20101221142504.000|TR0|mall to pick something up.  Didn't want to 
20101221142504.000|20101221142506.000|TR0|go.  Christine, it was nuts.  A week and a 
20101221142506.000|20101221142508.000|TR0|half ago, there was nobody there.
20101221142508.000|20101221142511.000|TR0|
20101221142511.000|20101221142513.000|TR0|CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS 
20101221142513.000|20101221142516.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  And retailers love it that 
20101221142516.000|20101221142518.000|TR0|the Christmas is on a Saturday this year, 
20101221142518.000|20101221142521.000|TR0|because it means all week this week they 
20101221142521.000|20101221142523.000|TR0|can try to get you into the stores to do 
20101221142523.000|20101221142525.000|TR0|some more shopping to finish up the lists.
20101221142525.000|20101221142528.000|TR0|
20101221142528.000|20101221142530.000|TR0|What kind of deals are you going to get?  
20101221142530.000|20101221142533.000|TR0|Well, toy prices might actually be on the 
20101221142533.000|20101221142535.000|TR0|rise.  Wal-Mart quietly raising prices on 
20101221142535.000|20101221142537.000|TR0|hundreds of toy, this according to a 
20101221142537.000|20101221142540.000|TR0|Bloomberg report.  This is because they 
20101221142540.000|20101221142542.000|TR0|were cut so steeply right after 
20101221142542.000|20101221142545.000|TR0|Thanksgiving, now they're going up a 
20101221142545.000|20101221142547.000|TR0|little bit.
20101221142547.000|20101221142550.000|TR0|
20101221142550.000|20101221142552.000|TR0|You could see apparel prices, though, 
20101221142552.000|20101221142554.000|TR0|Kyra, going down. Inventories are pretty 
20101221142554.000|20101221142557.000|TR0|lean, but a lot of the big apparel makers, 
20101221142557.000|20101221142559.000|TR0|apparel retailers will be cutting prices 
20101221142559.000|20101221142602.000|TR0|as we get closer to Christmas.
20101221142602.000|20101221142604.000|TR0|
20101221142604.000|20101221142607.000|TR0|Deals unlikely on the Kindle, though.  
20101221142607.000|20101221142609.000|TR0|That thing is sold out in a lot of 
20101221142609.000|20101221142611.000|TR0|locations.  Again, they kept the 
20101221142611.000|20101221142614.000|TR0|inventories pretty lean. They didn't want 
20101221142614.000|20101221142616.000|TR0|to have too much stuff on hand if the 
20101221142616.000|20101221142619.000|TR0|customers were going to be pretty cautious 
20101221142619.000|20101221142621.000|TR0|this year.  And, so, that's why you might 
20101221142621.000|20101221142624.000|TR0|be not seeing some big deals on that in 
20101221142624.000|20101221142626.000|TR0|the next few days.
20101221142626.000|20101221142628.000|TR0|
20101221142628.000|20101221142631.000|TR0|You could see some big deals, though, on 
20101221142631.000|20101221142633.000|TR0|the iPhone 4.  Believe it or not, Wal-Mart 
20101221142633.000|20101221142636.000|TR0|offering this for $197, and then you get a 
20101221142636.000|20101221142638.000|TR0|$50 gift card for the iPhone 4.  That's 
20101221142638.000|20101221142640.000|TR0|pretty interesting.  Sam's Club, according 
20101221142640.000|20101221142643.000|TR0|to a top web blog, or tech blog, is going 
20101221142643.000|20101221142645.000|TR0|to be offering a special that will have 
20101221142645.000|20101221142648.000|TR0|$147 for a limited time for the iPhone 4.  
20101221142648.000|20101221142650.000|TR0|You have to be a Sam's Club member.  So, 
20101221142650.000|20101221142653.000|TR0|if you are a Sam's Club member, watch out 
20101221142653.000|20101221142655.000|TR0|for that.
20101221142655.000|20101221142657.000|TR0|
20101221142657.000|20101221142700.000|TR0|Bottom line, Kyra, convenience, more 
20101221142700.000|20101221142702.000|TR0|hours, better return policies, Best Buy's 
20101221142702.000|20101221142705.000|TR0|quietly dropped its dreaded restocking 
20101221142705.000|20101221142707.000|TR0|fee. You're going to be able to get 
20101221142707.000|20101221142710.000|TR0|Christmas gifts, impulse gifts right there 
20101221142710.000|20101221142712.000|TR0|on the end caps on the end of the aisles 
20101221142712.000|20101221142714.000|TR0|at Target, and a lot of the big retailers 
20101221142714.000|20101221142717.000|TR0|are going to try to make it really easy 
20101221142717.000|20101221142719.000|TR0|for you, Kyra.
20101221142719.000|20101221142722.000|TR0|
20101221142722.000|20101221142724.000|TR0|PHILLLPS:  What's this about, if there's 
20101221142724.000|20101221142726.000|TR0|someone you don't expect coming in for the 
20101221142726.000|20101221142729.000|TR0|holidays, you can go to 7-11 to get their 
20101221142729.000|20101221142731.000|TR0|gift?  You get, what?  A Slurpee?  A Big 
20101221142731.000|20101221142734.000|TR0|Wheel?  Are you serious?
20101221142734.000|20101221142736.000|TR0|
20101221142736.000|20101221142739.000|TR0|ROMANS:  Believe it or not, 7-11 is 
20101221142739.000|20101221142741.000|TR0|saying, "We're there for you. We're there 
20101221142741.000|20101221142743.000|TR0|for you."  If you find yourself on 
20101221142743.000|20101221142746.000|TR0|Saturday morning on the way to dinner and 
20101221142746.000|20101221142748.000|TR0|have forgotten a guest, 7-11 is actually 
20101221142748.000|20101221142751.000|TR0|going to be open all day.  They're going 
20101221142751.000|20101221142753.000|TR0|to offer a selection of wines to give as a 
20101221142753.000|20101221142756.000|TR0|gift, gift cards, hand-held video games, 
20101221142756.000|20101221142758.000|TR0|more stuffed animals in the aisles.  
20101221142758.000|20101221142800.000|TR0|Things to make it easy for you to pick up 
20101221142800.000|20101221142803.000|TR0|something last minute.       CVS, the 
20101221142803.000|20101221142805.000|TR0|pharmacy chain, also going to have some 
20101221142805.000|20101221142808.000|TR0|consumer electronics available for people, 
20101221142808.000|20101221142810.000|TR0|also some more gifts of bath and body gel 
20101221142810.000|20101221142813.000|TR0|type gift baskets and the like.  Everybody 
20101221142813.000|20101221142815.000|TR0|wants to make it easy for us to spend our 
20101221142815.000|20101221142817.000|TR0|money this Christmas.  And you only have a 
20101221142817.000|20101221142820.000|TR0|few more days to do it.  Kyra?
20101221142820.000|20101221142822.000|TR0|
20101221142822.000|20101221142825.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  We want to jump start the 
20101221142825.000|20101221142827.000|TR0|economy.
20101221142827.000|20101221142829.000|TR0|
20101221142829.000|20101221142832.000|TR0|ROMANS:  A Slurpee with your Christmas 
20101221142832.000|20101221142834.000|TR0|list.
20101221142834.000|20101221142837.000|TR0|
20101221142837.000|20101221142839.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Exactly, really.  Here's your 
20101221142839.000|20101221142842.000|TR0|wine and Slurpee, Merry Christmas.  
20101221142842.000|20101221142844.000|TR0|Thanks, Christine.
20101221142844.000|20101221142846.000|TR0|
20101221142846.000|20101221142849.000|TR0|One of the biggest stories on Wall Street 
20101221142849.000|20101221142851.000|TR0|this year was Toyota and its massive 
20101221142851.000|20101221142854.000|TR0|recalls.  And today, the US government 
20101221142854.000|20101221142856.000|TR0|says the automaker is going to have to pay 
20101221142856.000|20101221142859.000|TR0|up.  Alison Kosik at the New York Stock 
20101221142859.000|20101221142901.000|TR0|Exchange talking more about that.  Hey, 
20101221142901.000|20101221142903.000|TR0|Alison.
20101221142903.000|20101221142906.000|TR0|
20101221142906.000|20101221142908.000|TR0|ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  
20101221142908.000|20101221142911.000|TR0|Hey, Kyra, yes.  We're talking about big 
20101221142911.000|20101221142913.000|TR0|money, here.  The Department of 
20101221142913.000|20101221142916.000|TR0|Transportation is fining Toyota $32 
20101221142916.000|20101221142918.000|TR0|million.  It's actually the maximum 
20101221142918.000|20101221142920.000|TR0|penalty that the law allows.
20101221142920.000|20101221142923.000|TR0|
20101221142923.000|20101221142925.000|TR0|Now, here's why Toyota is being fined.  
20101221142925.000|20101221142928.000|TR0|It's actually for two different reasons.  
20101221142928.000|20101221142930.000|TR0|For one, because of how it handled the 
20101221142930.000|20101221142932.000|TR0|recall of the defects of its floor mats 
20101221142932.000|20101221142935.000|TR0|and gas pedals.  And secondly, the 
20101221142935.000|20101221142937.000|TR0|automaker also didn't properly notify the 
20101221142937.000|20101221142940.000|TR0|government about another defect with 
20101221142940.000|20101221142942.000|TR0|steering in some trucks.  It delayed 
20101221142942.000|20101221142945.000|TR0|notifying the government about that, too.  
20101221142945.000|20101221142947.000|TR0|And by law, automakers have to tell the 
20101221142947.000|20101221142949.000|TR0|government within five days of learning 
20101221142949.000|20101221142952.000|TR0|about the defect.
20101221142952.000|20101221142954.000|TR0|
20101221142954.000|20101221142957.000|TR0|Now, surprisingly, these fines are really 
20101221142957.000|20101221142959.000|TR0|just a drop in the bucket for Toyota.  The 
20101221142959.000|20101221143002.000|TR0|company made $1 billion during the first 
20101221143002.000|20101221143004.000|TR0|half of this year, though.  Still, we 
20101221143004.000|20101221143006.000|TR0|can't deny the fact that the bad publicity 
20101221143006.000|20101221143009.000|TR0|hurt sales, has definitely hurt its 
20101221143009.000|20101221143011.000|TR0|reputation.  And there is one outstanding 
20101221143011.000|20101221143014.000|TR0|question mark in all of this, Kyra, for 
20101221143014.000|20101221143016.000|TR0|Toyota because they're still open to 
20101221143016.000|20101221143018.000|TR0|private lawsuits.  Kyra?
20101221143018.000|20101221143021.000|TR0|
20101221143021.000|20101221143023.000|TR0|PHILLIPS: All right.  Well what about the 
20101221143023.000|20101221143026.000|TR0|rest of the market? What does the open 
20101221143026.000|20101221143028.000|TR0|look like today?
20101221143028.000|20101221143031.000|TR0|
20101221143031.000|20101221143033.000|TR0|KOSIK:  We're starting just a bit higher 
20101221143033.000|20101221143035.000|TR0|right now.  At least in positive 
20101221143035.000|20101221143038.000|TR0|territory.  We do have some positive 
20101221143038.000|20101221143040.000|TR0|momentum, though, following a rally in 
20101221143040.000|20101221143043.000|TR0|Asian markets.  The major averages could 
20101221143043.000|20101221143045.000|TR0|top the two-year highs that were reached 
20101221143045.000|20101221143048.000|TR0|last week.  We don't have much economic 
20101221143048.000|20101221143050.000|TR0|news to trade on today, so not much to go 
20101221143050.000|20101221143052.000|TR0|on.  Investors are really waiting it out.
20101221143052.000|20101221143055.000|TR0|
20101221143055.000|20101221143057.000|TR0|Later this week, we are getting more 
20101221143057.000|20101221143100.000|TR0|economic data on housing, two reports 
20101221143100.000|20101221143102.000|TR0|there and on economic growth.  We may see 
20101221143102.000|20101221143105.000|TR0|some movement in the markets then.  But 
20101221143105.000|20101221143107.000|TR0|really just kind of quiet before getting 
20101221143107.000|20101221143109.000|TR0|into the three-day weekend, of course, for 
20101221143109.000|20101221143112.000|TR0|Christmas.
20101221143112.000|20101221143114.000|TR0|
20101221143114.000|20101221143117.000|TR0|Kyra, real fast, the Dow right now is up 
20101221143117.000|20101221143119.000|TR0|about 29 points.  NASDAQ also up slightly. 
20101221143119.000|20101221143121.000|TR0| Kyra, back the you.
20101221143121.000|20101221143124.000|TR0|
20101221143124.000|20101221143126.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Great.  Alison, thanks.
20101221143126.000|20101221143129.000|TR0|
20101221143129.000|20101221143131.000|TR0|Now let's take a look at our top stories.  
20101221143131.000|20101221143134.000|TR0|We began this past January in a remote 
20101221143134.000|20101221143136.000|TR0|corner of Alaska and after nearly a year 
20101221143136.000|20101221143138.000|TR0|in the making, the 2010 census is done.  
20101221143138.000|20101221143141.000|TR0|The census was the shortest in U.S. 
20101221143141.000|20101221143143.000|TR0|history, by the way.  Surveyed 34 million 
20101221143143.000|20101221143146.000|TR0|households.  The results expected in just 
20101221143146.000|20101221143148.000|TR0|about an hour and a half.
20101221143148.000|20101221143151.000|TR0|
20101221143151.000|20101221143153.000|TR0|And soon that check won't be in the mail.  
20101221143153.000|20101221143155.000|TR0|Those applying for Social Security before 
20101221143155.000|20101221143158.000|TR0|May 1st will now get their checks 
20101221143158.000|20101221143200.000|TR0|electronically through direct deposit or a 
20101221143200.000|20101221143203.000|TR0|direct express debit card. Paperless 
20101221143203.000|20101221143205.000|TR0|payments will save Social Security a 
20101221143205.000|20101221143208.000|TR0|billion dollars over the next ten years.
20101221143208.000|20101221143210.000|TR0|
20101221143210.000|20101221143212.000|TR0|And 22 years ago today, a terrorist bomb 
20101221143212.000|20101221143215.000|TR0|brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over 
20101221143215.000|20101221143217.000|TR0|Lockerbie, killing 270 people, mostly 
20101221143217.000|20101221143220.000|TR0|Americans.  This morning, a Senate report 
20101221143220.000|20101221143222.000|TR0|blasting the humanitarian release on the 
20101221143222.000|20101221143224.000|TR0|one man convicted on that attack, a Libyan 
20101221143224.000|20101221143227.000|TR0|intelligence officer who supposedly had 
20101221143227.000|20101221143229.000|TR0|just three months to live.  That was 13 
20101221143229.000|20101221143232.000|TR0|months ago. Today, he's still alive.  
20101221143232.000|20101221143234.000|TR0|Senate report claims that his release was 
20101221143234.000|20101221143237.000|TR0|part of a deal that ensured Britain would 
20101221143237.000|20101221143239.000|TR0|keep lucrative oil and defense contracts 
20101221143239.000|20101221143241.000|TR0|with Libya.
20101221143241.000|20101221143244.000|TR0|
20101221143244.000|20101221143246.000|TR0|Well, Spiderman takes a tumble, falling 20 
20101221143246.000|20101221143249.000|TR0|to 30 feet during last night's show of the 
20101221143249.000|20101221143251.000|TR0|Broadway musical "Spiderman: Turn Off The 
20101221143251.000|20101221143254.000|TR0|Dark." There's the inside video right 
20101221143254.000|20101221143256.000|TR0|there.  The performer rushed to the 
20101221143256.000|20101221143258.000|TR0|hospital after crashing to the stage floor 
20101221143258.000|20101221143301.000|TR0|from a platform.  The show just couldn't 
20101221143301.000|20101221143303.000|TR0|go on.
20101221143303.000|20101221143306.000|TR0|
20101221143306.000|20101221143308.000|TR0|House lights came up.  And the audience 
20101221143308.000|20101221143310.000|TR0|sent home.  This is just the latest mishap 
20101221143310.000|20101221143313.000|TR0|for the most expensive Broadway show ever 
20101221143313.000|20101221143315.000|TR0|staged.
20101221143315.000|20101221143318.000|TR0|
20101221143318.000|20101221143320.000|TR0|And brings us to the "A.M. Extra."  John 
20101221143320.000|20101221143323.000|TR0|Roberts live in New York.  So, John, we 
20101221143323.000|20101221143325.000|TR0|should point out that it's not the actor, 
20101221143325.000|20101221143327.000|TR0|Reeve Carney, who fell but a stunt double. 
20101221143327.000|20101221143330.000|TR0| Do we have any idea how he's doing right 
20101221143330.000|20101221143332.000|TR0|now?
20101221143332.000|20101221143335.000|TR0|
20101221143335.000|20101221143337.000|TR0|JOHN ROBERTS, CNN ANCHOR, "AMERICAN 
20101221143337.000|20101221143340.000|TR0|MORNING":  There's been nothing official.  
20101221143340.000|20101221143342.000|TR0|We've been calling in to Bellevue Hospital 
20101221143342.000|20101221143344.000|TR0|to try to get a condition on this actor.  
20101221143344.000|20101221143347.000|TR0|And it's becoming increasingly apparent 
20101221143347.000|20101221143349.000|TR0|that the fellow who was injured may have 
20101221143349.000|20101221143352.000|TR0|been Christopher Teirney, who is the main 
20101221143352.000|20101221143354.000|TR0|aerialist for the production.  One of nine 
20101221143354.000|20101221143357.000|TR0|stunt doubles but the main aerialist.  
20101221143357.000|20101221143359.000|TR0|Christopher Teirney, 31-year- old guy.
20101221143359.000|20101221143401.000|TR0|
20101221143401.000|20101221143404.000|TR0|Again, Bellevue Hospital not confirmed any 
20101221143404.000|20101221143406.000|TR0|of this yet, but Associated Press told by 
20101221143406.000|20101221143409.000|TR0|a fellow actor that Christopher Tierney 
20101221143409.000|20101221143411.000|TR0|was the guy injured last night.
20101221143411.000|20101221143413.000|TR0|
20101221143413.000|20101221143416.000|TR0|But Kyra, the buzz that this play is 
20101221143416.000|20101221143418.000|TR0|getting is just unbelievable.  First of 
20101221143418.000|20101221143421.000|TR0|all, it's $65 million.  Most expensive 
20101221143421.000|20101221143423.000|TR0|production ever been launched by Broadway. 
20101221143423.000|20101221143426.000|TR0| Bono and The Edge from U2 are the ones 
20101221143426.000|20101221143428.000|TR0|who are behind the music.  First time 
20101221143428.000|20101221143430.000|TR0|they've involved in something like this.
20101221143430.000|20101221143433.000|TR0|
20101221143433.000|20101221143435.000|TR0|And it's been plagued by mishaps.  Kenneth 
20101221143435.000|20101221143438.000|TR0|Hobbins (ph), who was one of the dancers 
20101221143438.000|20101221143440.000|TR0|at a preview performance for the people 
20101221143440.000|20101221143443.000|TR0|who were involved in the industry who have 
20101221143443.000|20101221143445.000|TR0|to go out and talk about this and sell 
20101221143445.000|20101221143447.000|TR0|tickets, broke both of his wrists when he 
20101221143447.000|20101221143450.000|TR0|was involved in an aerial sequence.  And a 
20101221143450.000|20101221143452.000|TR0|catapult that was supposed to shoot him 
20101221143452.000|20101221143455.000|TR0|from the back of the state to the front of 
20101221143455.000|20101221143457.000|TR0|the stage and he landed like this.  Broke 
20101221143457.000|20101221143459.000|TR0|both of his wrists.  Natalie Mendoza, who 
20101221143459.000|20101221143502.000|TR0|plays the character of Arachne, was hit in 
20101221143502.000|20101221143504.000|TR0|the head by a rope, a very heavy rope. She 
20101221143504.000|20101221143507.000|TR0|suffered a concussion.  Had to leave the 
20101221143507.000|20101221143509.000|TR0|production for ten days.
20101221143509.000|20101221143512.000|TR0|
20101221143512.000|20101221143514.000|TR0|So this thing has had the fair share of 
20101221143514.000|20101221143516.000|TR0|problems.  To the degree that the opening 
20101221143516.000|20101221143519.000|TR0|night said to be pushed back to February 
20101221143519.000|20101221143521.000|TR0|7th.  We don't know at this point whether 
20101221143521.000|20101221143524.000|TR0|or not this mishap that happened last 
20101221143524.000|20101221143526.000|TR0|night were to appeared that the harness 
20101221143526.000|20101221143529.000|TR0|came off or the line holding on to the 
20101221143529.000|20101221143531.000|TR0|person who we believe was Christopher 
20101221143531.000|20101221143533.000|TR0|Tierney snapped, but they're obviously 
20101221143533.000|20101221143536.000|TR0|going have to have a very, very in-depth 
20101221143536.000|20101221143538.000|TR0|look at that as you're looking at this 
20101221143538.000|20101221143541.000|TR0|video here.  He leaps off and it looks 
20101221143541.000|20101221143543.000|TR0|like the rope snaps.
20101221143543.000|20101221143546.000|TR0|
20101221143546.000|20101221143548.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, it's only about eight 
20101221143548.000|20101221143550.000|TR0|seconds.  This is when he was obviously 
20101221143550.000|20101221143553.000|TR0|taken out by paramedics but, you know, 
20101221143553.000|20101221143555.000|TR0|we'll -- it goes really fast, but we'll 
20101221143555.000|20101221143558.000|TR0|try to show you.  I don't know if there's 
20101221143558.000|20101221143600.000|TR0|a way to slow it down or not.  Only eight 
20101221143600.000|20101221143602.000|TR0|seconds, but somebody caught this video 
20101221143602.000|20101221143605.000|TR0|inside the performance.
20101221143605.000|20101221143607.000|TR0|
20101221143607.000|20101221143610.000|TR0|We'll try -- there it is right there.  You 
20101221143610.000|20101221143612.000|TR0|can see him up there on top and it just -- 
20101221143612.000|20101221143615.000|TR0|straight shot.  Now, what's interesting, 
20101221143615.000|20101221143617.000|TR0|you actually talked to some of the guys 
20101221143617.000|20101221143619.000|TR0|that were inside the performance, and they 
20101221143619.000|20101221143622.000|TR0|thought maybe it was a part of the show, 
20101221143622.000|20101221143624.000|TR0|right?  Folks didn't realize something had 
20101221143624.000|20101221143627.000|TR0|gone wrong.
20101221143627.000|20101221143629.000|TR0|
20101221143629.000|20101221143632.000|TR0|ROBERTS:  Yes.  We talked with Michael and 
20101221143632.000|20101221143634.000|TR0|Jonathan Diawos, who are a couple of 
20101221143634.000|20101221143636.000|TR0|tourists in from New Zealand who went to 
20101221143636.000|20101221143639.000|TR0|see the show. And they said throughout the 
20101221143639.000|20101221143641.000|TR0|program, because it's so high-tech and 
20101221143641.000|20101221143644.000|TR0|it's so physical with flying sequences.  
20101221143644.000|20101221143646.000|TR0|They were expecting something was going to 
20101221143646.000|20101221143649.000|TR0|go wrong, maybe an actor getting stuck, an 
20101221143649.000|20101221143651.000|TR0|aerialist getting stucks, as has happened 
20101221143651.000|20101221143653.000|TR0|in the past.  One fellow was left hanging 
20101221143653.000|20101221143656.000|TR0|about 15 feet over the seats for quite a 
20101221143656.000|20101221143658.000|TR0|period of time while they had to try to 
20101221143658.000|20101221143701.000|TR0|get him down.
20101221143701.000|20101221143703.000|TR0|
20101221143703.000|20101221143705.000|TR0|When they saw this happen originally, and 
20101221143705.000|20101221143708.000|TR0|you've got the character of Mary Jane, 
20101221143708.000|20101221143710.000|TR0|who's hanging off the edge of the bridge 
20101221143710.000|20101221143713.000|TR0|as the Green Goblin looking over and 
20101221143713.000|20101221143715.000|TR0|Spiderman is supposed to leap off the 
20101221143715.000|20101221143718.000|TR0|bridge after her and swoop down and grab 
20101221143718.000|20101221143720.000|TR0|her, in that hole in the stage, the stage 
20101221143720.000|20101221143722.000|TR0|pit.  Obviously, it went wrong.  People 
20101221143722.000|20101221143725.000|TR0|weren't sure whether or not that was a 
20101221143725.000|20101221143727.000|TR0|part of the show at first, but then became 
20101221143727.000|20101221143730.000|TR0|very apparent very quickly something went 
20101221143730.000|20101221143732.000|TR0|terribly wrong.
20101221143732.000|20101221143735.000|TR0|
20101221143735.000|20101221143737.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And real quick, before we go, 
20101221143737.000|20101221143739.000|TR0|we put together some numbers here.  You 
20101221143739.000|20101221143742.000|TR0|and Carol and I were talking about this. 
20101221143742.000|20101221143744.000|TR0|That OSHA reported in 2008 nationwide 
20101221143744.000|20101221143747.000|TR0|4,100 performance artist injuries and then 
20101221143747.000|20101221143749.000|TR0|it went up in 2009.  5,800 performance 
20101221143749.000|20101221143751.000|TR0|artist injuries.
20101221143751.000|20101221143754.000|TR0|
20101221143754.000|20101221143756.000|TR0|So, John, do we have any idea if the 
20101221143756.000|20101221143759.000|TR0|show's going to go on?
20101221143759.000|20101221143801.000|TR0|
20101221143801.000|20101221143804.000|TR0|ROBERTS:  The show -- I mean, on Broadway, 
20101221143804.000|20101221143806.000|TR0|Kyra, unless you have terrible box office 
20101221143806.000|20101221143808.000|TR0|receipts which this show hasn't.  I mean, 
20101221143808.000|20101221143811.000|TR0|it's been playing to packed audiences, the 
20101221143811.000|20101221143813.000|TR0|show always goes on.  There's obviously 
20101221143813.000|20101221143816.000|TR0|going to be a review to find out what 
20101221143816.000|20101221143818.000|TR0|happened.  Redoubling of the efforts on 
20101221143818.000|20101221143821.000|TR0|safety, make sure that this fellow is okay.
20101221143821.000|20101221143823.000|TR0|
20101221143823.000|20101221143825.000|TR0|I don't know if this will push back the 
20101221143825.000|20101221143828.000|TR0|opening night date past February 7th or 
20101221143828.000|20101221143830.000|TR0|not.  That will be yet to be determined, 
20101221143830.000|20101221143833.000|TR0|but I think in this case, when you've got 
20101221143833.000|20101221143835.000|TR0|this much money on the line and this much 
20101221143835.000|20101221143838.000|TR0|prestige on the line and this much buzz 
20101221143838.000|20101221143840.000|TR0|about it, the show will definitely go on.
20101221143840.000|20101221143842.000|TR0|
20101221143842.000|20101221143845.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Got it.  John, thanks.

20101221143847.000|20101221143850.000|TR0|Equal access to the Web.  That's what the

20101221144024.000|20101221144027.000|TR0|Christie finishing up his first year in 
20101221144027.000|20101221144029.000|TR0|office.  So, how does his constituents

20101221144031.000|20101221144034.000|TR0|in-your-face style that he has?  His 
20101221144034.000|20101221144036.000|TR0|approval ratings are actually topping the

20101221144053.000|20101221144056.000|TR0|Hey, there, Kyra.  So, should the governor 
20101221144056.000|20101221144058.000|TR0|of New Jersey Chris Christie run for 
20101221144058.000|20101221144100.000|TR0|president? If you ask someone who is in 
20101221144100.000|20101221144103.000|TR0|New Jersey, they might say, "Forget about 
20101221144103.000|20101221144105.000|TR0|it!".  We have some new poll numbers that 
20101221144105.000|20101221144108.000|TR0|show he's down about five points.  His 
20101221144108.000|20101221144110.000|TR0|approval ratings, according to this 
20101221144110.000|20101221144113.000|TR0|Quinnipiac University poll, show that his 
20101221144113.000|20101221144115.000|TR0|approval rating is at 46 percent, his 
20101221144115.000|20101221144117.000|TR0|disapproval is at 44 percent.  Again, 
20101221144117.000|20101221144120.000|TR0|that's down about five points since 
20101221144120.000|20101221144122.000|TR0|November.       There's been a lot of 
20101221144122.000|20101221144125.000|TR0|buzz, a lot of chatter -- he is like a 
20101221144125.000|20101221144127.000|TR0|rock star to a lot of conservative 
20101221144127.000|20101221144130.000|TR0|Republicans about a potential 2012 bid. He 
20101221144130.000|20101221144132.000|TR0|swatted away a lot of that saying, hey, I 
20101221144132.000|20101221144134.000|TR0|have no intentions of running for 
20101221144134.000|20101221144137.000|TR0|president in 2012.  But a lot of people 
20101221144137.000|20101221144139.000|TR0|say, hey, maybe he should because he's got 
20101221144139.000|20101221144142.000|TR0|a pretty in-your-face style, and a lot of 
20101221144142.000|20101221144144.000|TR0|people like that.
20101221144144.000|20101221144146.000|TR0|
20101221144146.000|20101221144149.000|TR0|In terms of net neutrality, what is net 
20101221144149.000|20101221144151.000|TR0|neutrality?  Let's say first say that the 
20101221144151.000|20101221144154.000|TR0|FCC is going to be voting on net 
20101221144154.000|20101221144156.000|TR0|neutrality today, It's expected to pass.  
20101221144156.000|20101221144159.000|TR0|It will then go to Congress.
20101221144159.000|20101221144201.000|TR0|
20101221144201.000|20101221144203.000|TR0|But let's break down what it is.  Net 
20101221144203.000|20101221144206.000|TR0|neutrality basically is sort of like a 
20101221144206.000|20101221144208.000|TR0|rules of the road so that Internet service 
20101221144208.000|20101221144211.000|TR0|providers can't say, speed up Web sites or 
20101221144211.000|20101221144213.000|TR0|apps from paying customers and can't slow 
20101221144213.000|20101221144216.000|TR0|down, say, Web sites or applications from 
20101221144216.000|20101221144218.000|TR0|some of their competitors.  So, the FCC is 
20101221144218.000|20101221144220.000|TR0|expected to vote on this today, it's 
20101221144220.000|20101221144223.000|TR0|expected to pass and then go to Congress.
20101221144223.000|20101221144225.000|TR0|
20101221144225.000|20101221144228.000|TR0|And then lastly, the last Senate race in 
20101221144228.000|20101221144230.000|TR0|the nation, where does it stand?  We're 
20101221144230.000|20101221144232.000|TR0|talking about Alaska.  Joe Miller, Tea 
20101221144232.000|20101221144235.000|TR0|Party favorite. Senator Lisa Murkowski, 
20101221144235.000|20101221144237.000|TR0|Republican incumbent senator.  The case 
20101221144237.000|20101221144240.000|TR0|right now, Joe Miller's challenge to the 
20101221144240.000|20101221144242.000|TR0|write-in ballots. Remember, Murkowski ran 
20101221144242.000|20101221144245.000|TR0|as a write-in candidate.  The case stands 
20101221144245.000|20101221144247.000|TR0|in Alaska supreme court.  I made some 
20101221144247.000|20101221144249.000|TR0|calls yesterday just to see where things 
20101221144249.000|20101221144252.000|TR0|stand.  Right now, we are waiting on a 
20101221144252.000|20101221144254.000|TR0|decision from the supreme court.  The 
20101221144254.000|20101221144257.000|TR0|Alaska supreme court.  At any moment.
20101221144257.000|20101221144259.000|TR0|
20101221144259.000|20101221144302.000|TR0|But Murkowski's campaign said, you know 
20101221144302.000|20101221144304.000|TR0|what? It may not matter. The senator may 
20101221144304.000|20101221144306.000|TR0|actually be certified this week or early 
20101221144306.000|20101221144309.000|TR0|next.  And that's what they're really 
20101221144309.000|20101221144311.000|TR0|counting on, getting that certification so 
20101221144311.000|20101221144314.000|TR0|that she can then be sworn in.
20101221144314.000|20101221144316.000|TR0|
20101221144316.000|20101221144319.000|TR0|The Miller campaign tells me, hey, that 
20101221144319.000|20101221144321.000|TR0|might happen but we're prepared to take 
20101221144321.000|20101221144323.000|TR0|this all the way to the U.S. Supreme 
20101221144323.000|20101221144326.000|TR0|Court.  So, no end in sight yet on that.

20101221144340.000|20101221144343.000|TR0|All right.  Let's talk about an 
20101221144343.000|20101221144345.000|TR0|anniversary some folks are celebrating, 
20101221144345.000|20101221144348.000|TR0|others are definitely protesting.  150 
20101221144348.000|20101221144350.000|TR0|years ago Monday, South Carolina said 
20101221144350.000|20101221144352.000|TR0|"peace out" and left the union.  We all 
20101221144352.000|20101221144355.000|TR0|know how that turned out.  One horrific 
20101221144355.000|20101221144357.000|TR0|civil war and about 600,000 dead soldiers 
20101221144357.000|20101221144400.000|TR0|later, South Carolina was back.
20101221144400.000|20101221144402.000|TR0|
20101221144402.000|20101221144405.000|TR0|Well last night, there was a Secession 
20101221144405.000|20101221144407.000|TR0|Ball in Charleston, complete with costumes 
20101221144407.000|20101221144409.000|TR0|and mint juleps and of course, there were 
20101221144409.000|20101221144412.000|TR0|no slaves there.  No battlefield 
20101221144412.000|20101221144414.000|TR0|amputations without anesthesia, no 
20101221144414.000|20101221144417.000|TR0|starving soldiers, no scorched earth, no 
20101221144417.000|20101221144419.000|TR0|chaos because, after all, it's a ball, 
20101221144419.000|20101221144422.000|TR0|y'all.  Organizers said they're 
20101221144422.000|20101221144424.000|TR0|celebrating South Carolinians who stood up 
20101221144424.000|20101221144426.000|TR0|for what they believed in.  Critics say 
20101221144426.000|20101221144429.000|TR0|the problem is the state delegates in 1860 
20101221144429.000|20101221144431.000|TR0|believed in treason and protecting slavery.
20101221144431.000|20101221144434.000|TR0|
20101221144434.000|20101221144436.000|TR0|Here's what the guy from the Confederate

20101221144448.000|20101221144451.000|TR0| We're not celebrating slavery by any 
20101221144451.000|20101221144453.000|TR0|means.  We wouldn't do that.  We think 
20101221144453.000|20101221144455.000|TR0|slavery is a -- was a horrible institution 
20101221144455.000|20101221144458.000|TR0|and we're glad that it's gone.  It's more 
20101221144458.000|20101221144500.000|TR0|of an observance and a historical 
20101221144500.000|20101221144503.000|TR0|presentation of what happened and who 
20101221144503.000|20101221144505.000|TR0|these men were.

20101221144515.000|20101221144517.000|TR0|they say the whole ball celebrates slavery 
20101221144517.000|20101221144520.000|TR0|and some members from Charleston Branch 
20101221144520.000|20101221144522.000|TR0|picketed at a hotel where the ball goers 
20101221144522.000|20101221144524.000|TR0|were staying.

20101221144527.000|20101221144529.000|TR0|We like what Larry Wilmore from "The Daily

20101221144532.000|20101221144534.000|TR0|looked at the secession documents.

20101221144541.000|20101221144544.000|TR0|LARRY WILMORE, "THE DAILY SHOW":  Let's -- 
20101221144544.000|20101221144546.000|TR0|let's see.  What was South Carolina's 
20101221144546.000|20101221144549.000|TR0|reasons for leaving the union?  The 
20101221144549.000|20101221144551.000|TR0|current of anti- slavery feeling?  They 
20101221144551.000|20101221144554.000|TR0|have denounced the sinful institution of 
20101221144554.000|20101221144556.000|TR0|slavery; encouraged slaves to leave their 
20101221144556.000|20101221144558.000|TR0|homes; elected a president whose opinions 
20101221144558.000|20101221144601.000|TR0|and purposes are hostile to slavery.  The 
20101221144601.000|20101221144603.000|TR0|slave holding states will no longer have 
20101221144603.000|20101221144606.000|TR0|the power of self-government.  They called 
20101221144606.000|20101221144608.000|TR0|themselves the slave-holding states.
20101221144608.000|20101221144611.000|TR0|
20101221144611.000|20101221144613.000|TR0|Look, saying slavery was the cause of 
20101221144613.000|20101221144615.000|TR0|secession isn't politically correct.  It's 
20101221144615.000|20101221144618.000|TR0|correct-correct.

20101221144625.000|20101221144627.000|TR0|there were other arguments, there were 
20101221144627.000|20101221144630.000|TR0|things about taxes in that document, Larry?
20101221144630.000|20101221144632.000|TR0|
20101221144632.000|20101221144635.000|TR0|WILMORE:  Yes.  Taxes on slaves.  Jon, 
20101221144635.000|20101221144637.000|TR0|they thought the north counted slaves as 
20101221144637.000|20101221144640.000|TR0|too much of a person.

20101221144944.000|20101221144946.000|TR0|VERJEE:  Plus, you may not cook exactly 
20101221144946.000|20101221144949.000|TR0|like that, but you're a good cook.  This 
20101221144949.000|20101221144951.000|TR0|-- this -- that was the scene there.  I 
20101221144951.000|20101221144953.000|TR0|mean, a belly dancer, there were pots and 
20101221144953.000|20101221144956.000|TR0|pans being used as percussion instruments. 
20101221144956.000|20101221144958.000|TR0|And they were -- they were actually 
20101221144958.000|20101221145001.000|TR0|cooking for the customers while they were 
20101221145001.000|20101221145003.000|TR0|there.
20101221145003.000|20101221145005.000|TR0|
20101221145005.000|20101221145008.000|TR0|And the whole idea is -- is -- is that it 
20101221145008.000|20101221145010.000|TR0|should really be something where food 
20101221145010.000|20101221145013.000|TR0|meets performance art.  They say it's part 
20101221145013.000|20101221145015.000|TR0|of creativity and it just makes the food 
20101221145015.000|20101221145018.000|TR0|taste better.
20101221145018.000|20101221145020.000|TR0|
20101221145020.000|20101221145022.000|TR0|Kyra, you ever seen anything like that?
20101221145022.000|20101221145025.000|TR0|
20101221145025.000|20101221145027.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  No -- well, actually, that's 
20101221145027.000|20101221145030.000|TR0|usually a Friday night out with you.  But 
20101221145030.000|20101221145032.000|TR0|that's a whole another story.
20101221145032.000|20101221145035.000|TR0|
20101221145035.000|20101221145037.000|TR0|All right.  Up next, Europe's becoming a 
20101221145037.000|20101221145039.000|TR0|bit of a winter wonderland.  Yes, 
20101221145039.000|20101221145042.000|TR0|travelers wondering when they're going to 
20101221145042.000|20101221145044.000|TR0|go home.     VERJEE:  Yes, yes, this is 
20101221145044.000|20101221145047.000|TR0|nowhere near as fun.  I mean, there is 
20101221145047.000|20101221145049.000|TR0|outrage, there is frustration, and there 
20101221145049.000|20101221145052.000|TR0|are a lot of tears.  There was one person 
20101221145052.000|20101221145054.000|TR0|we spoke to today, Kyra, that said that 
20101221145054.000|20101221145056.000|TR0|Heathrow Airport is like a refugee camp.  
20101221145056.000|20101221145059.000|TR0|People have been camped out there for 
20101221145059.000|20101221145101.000|TR0|three or four days, they're sleeping on 
20101221145101.000|20101221145104.000|TR0|makeshift areas on mattresses. They -- 
20101221145104.000|20101221145106.000|TR0|some of them don't have enough blankets.  
20101221145106.000|20101221145108.000|TR0|Food or water is running out of the 
20101221145108.000|20101221145111.000|TR0|airport.
20101221145111.000|20101221145113.000|TR0|
20101221145113.000|20101221145116.000|TR0|So it's a really terrible situation.  A 
20101221145116.000|20101221145118.000|TR0|lot of people are just standing there and 
20101221145118.000|20101221145121.000|TR0|crying their eyes out because their -- 
20101221145121.000|20101221145123.000|TR0|they may miss their Christmas vacations 
20101221145123.000|20101221145125.000|TR0|that they've planned for so long and won't 
20101221145125.000|20101221145128.000|TR0|see their loved ones.  And it's just 
20101221145128.000|20101221145130.000|TR0|frustrating.
20101221145130.000|20101221145133.000|TR0|
20101221145133.000|20101221145135.000|TR0|Heathrow Airport is saying today that one 
20101221145135.000|20101221145138.000|TR0|third of flights only will leave.  The 
20101221145138.000|20101221145140.000|TR0|reason that they're doing that is they're 
20101221145140.000|20101221145142.000|TR0|trying to give themselves a little 
20101221145142.000|20101221145145.000|TR0|breathing space.  So they need to figure 
20101221145145.000|20101221145147.000|TR0|out where the crews are, where the planes 
20101221145147.000|20101221145150.000|TR0|are, and things like that.
20101221145150.000|20101221145152.000|TR0|
20101221145152.000|20101221145155.000|TR0|So it's still going to take a while, ice 
20101221145155.000|20101221145157.000|TR0|is a problem and all of Europe is -- is 
20101221145157.000|20101221145159.000|TR0|dealing with this, so much of Europe, 
20101221145159.000|20101221145202.000|TR0|particularly with the roads.  People can't 
20101221145202.000|20101221145204.000|TR0|travel on them and trucks abandon Germany, 
20101221145204.000|20101221145207.000|TR0|for example, from moving.
20101221145207.000|20101221145209.000|TR0|
20101221145209.000|20101221145211.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right, I hope you don't 
20101221145211.000|20101221145214.000|TR0|have to travel anytime soon.
20101221145214.000|20101221145216.000|TR0|
20101221145216.000|20101221145219.000|TR0|All right, let's talk about that last 
20101221145219.000|20101221145221.000|TR0|lunar eclipse.  You know, we saw it in the 
20101221145221.000|20101221145224.000|TR0|U.S.  We're not going to see another until 
20101221145224.000|20101221145226.000|TR0|2014.
20101221145226.000|20101221145228.000|TR0|
20101221145228.000|20101221145231.000|TR0|VERJEE:  Right.
20101221145231.000|20101221145233.000|TR0|
20101221145233.000|20101221145236.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Did you see it in the UK?
20101221145236.000|20101221145238.000|TR0|
20101221145238.000|20101221145241.000|TR0|VERJEE:  No, I -- I actually needed my 
20101221145241.000|20101221145243.000|TR0|beauty sleep.  So I didn't get up.  I 
20101221145243.000|20101221145245.000|TR0|mean, this isn't easy, you know, Kyra.  
20101221145245.000|20101221145248.000|TR0|But it was really a heavenly show for 
20101221145248.000|20101221145250.000|TR0|those people that did see it.  It was just 
20101221145250.000|20101221145253.000|TR0|incredible.  A lunar eclipse that was 
20101221145253.000|20101221145255.000|TR0|actually coincidentally on the day of the 
20101221145255.000|20101221145257.000|TR0|winter solstice and that hasn't happened 
20101221145257.000|20101221145300.000|TR0|since 1638.
20101221145300.000|20101221145302.000|TR0|
20101221145302.000|20101221145305.000|TR0|So it's pretty amazing.  And -- and if you 
20101221145305.000|20101221145307.000|TR0|look at the pictures, you'll see that, 
20101221145307.000|20101221145310.000|TR0|Kyra, the moon looks actually very high 
20101221145310.000|20101221145312.000|TR0|and that's because the earth's axis is 
20101221145312.000|20101221145314.000|TR0|slightly tilted because it was on the 
20101221145314.000|20101221145317.000|TR0|winter solstice.  So that's why it looks 
20101221145317.000|20101221145319.000|TR0|like that.
20101221145319.000|20101221145322.000|TR0|
20101221145322.000|20101221145324.000|TR0|But you're right.  It's going to take a 
20101221145324.000|20101221145327.000|TR0|while before we see that again.  Here is 
20101221145327.000|20101221145329.000|TR0|the beautiful heavenly shot.  A lunar 
20101221145329.000|20101221145331.000|TR0|eclipse, we won't see it for a long time 
20101221145331.000|20101221145334.000|TR0|since -- until 2014.  Right.
20101221145334.000|20101221145336.000|TR0|
20101221145336.000|20101221145339.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  We can wait.  Hopefully we'll 
20101221145339.000|20101221145341.000|TR0|be around talking about it.  Good to see 
20101221145341.000|20101221145344.000|TR0|you, Zain.
20101221145344.000|20101221145346.000|TR0|
20101221145346.000|20101221145348.000|TR0|VERJEE:  Hopefully I'll catch it then, 
20101221145348.000|20101221145351.000|TR0|Kyra.
20101221145351.000|20101221145353.000|TR0|
20101221145353.000|20101221145356.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes exactly.  And you don't 
20101221145356.000|20101221145358.000|TR0|need any more beauty sleep.
20101221145358.000|20101221145400.000|TR0|
20101221145400.000|20101221145403.000|TR0|VERJEE:  I welcome my belly dancing report.
20101221145403.000|20101221145405.000|TR0|
20101221145405.000|20101221145408.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, yes, please.  Zain, oh, my 
20101221145408.000|20101221145410.000|TR0|goodness.
20101221145410.000|20101221145413.000|TR0|

20101221145422.000|20101221145425.000|TR0|CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Kyra, mud 
20101221145425.000|20101221145427.000|TR0|slides, flash flood warnings, heavy snow, 
20101221145427.000|20101221145430.000|TR0|we'll tell you all about this heavy 
20101221145430.000|20101221145432.000|TR0|rainstorm that's been hammering California

20101221145444.000|20101221145446.000|TR0|day and a half as more moisture comes in 
20101221145446.000|20101221145449.000|TR0|and then a change in the weather pattern.  
20101221145449.000|20101221145451.000|TR0|And this storm or at least a part of it 
20101221145451.000|20101221145454.000|TR0|will be heading to the East Coast.  We'll

20101221145552.000|20101221145554.000|TR0|new friend to the team, NBA TV Host, Kyle

20101221145557.000|20101221145559.000|TR0|
20101221145559.000|20101221145602.000|TR0|KYLE MONTGOMERY, NBA TV Host:  Good to see 
20101221145602.000|20101221145604.000|TR0|you.  I'm glad to be here.
20101221145604.000|20101221145606.000|TR0|
20101221145606.000|20101221145609.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Talking about my old stomping 
20101221145609.000|20101221145611.000|TR0|grounds.  Well, Brett Favre is no longer 
20101221145611.000|20101221145614.000|TR0|with Green Bay, Wisconsin --
20101221145614.000|20101221145616.000|TR0|
20101221145616.000|20101221145619.000|TR0|MONTGOMERY:  Yes.
20101221145619.000|20101221145621.000|TR0|
20101221145621.000|20101221145623.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  But this is someone that I even 
20101221145623.000|20101221145626.000|TR0|covered for a while when I was working in 
20101221145626.000|20101221145628.000|TR0|the great city of Green Bay.
20101221145628.000|20101221145631.000|TR0|
20101221145631.000|20101221145633.000|TR0|MONTGOMERY:  You know, I had the 
20101221145633.000|20101221145636.000|TR0|opportunity to cover Brett, as well, down 
20101221145636.000|20101221145638.000|TR0|in Hinesburg, Mississippi.
20101221145638.000|20101221145640.000|TR0|
20101221145640.000|20101221145643.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Oh.  You're going back to 
20101221145643.000|20101221145645.000|TR0|college.
20101221145645.000|20101221145648.000|TR0|
20101221145648.000|20101221145650.000|TR0|MONTGOMERY:  College of Southern 
20101221145650.000|20101221145652.000|TR0|Mississippi, absolutely.  So I guess I'm 
20101221145652.000|20101221145655.000|TR0|going to be wearing my age a little bit.
20101221145655.000|20101221145657.000|TR0|
20101221145657.000|20101221145700.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  Well, he's 
20101221145700.000|20101221145702.000|TR0|definitely -- he's had a long and 
20101221145702.000|20101221145705.000|TR0|successful career, but it may be coming to 
20101221145705.000|20101221145707.000|TR0|an end.       MONTGOMERY:  Well, 
20101221145707.000|20101221145709.000|TR0|unfortunately, maybe so.  As you know last 
20101221145709.000|20101221145712.000|TR0|Monday Brett's consecutive start streak 
20101221145712.000|20101221145714.000|TR0|ended at 321; this is because of an injury 
20101221145714.000|20101221145717.000|TR0|to his throwing arm.  Some thought at the 
20101221145717.000|20101221145719.000|TR0|time he was done, but Favre as you know, 
20101221145719.000|20101221145722.000|TR0|already said this is his final season. He 
20101221145722.000|20101221145724.000|TR0|wanted to have another shot.  So this may 
20101221145724.000|20101221145726.000|TR0|have been a bad idea.
20101221145726.000|20101221145729.000|TR0|
20101221145729.000|20101221145731.000|TR0|Last night the second quarter of the game 
20101221145731.000|20101221145734.000|TR0|against the Bears, defensive end Corey 
20101221145734.000|20101221145736.000|TR0|Wootton comes down hard on Brett, smashed 
20101221145736.000|20101221145738.000|TR0|his head into this frozen turf so you can 
20101221145738.000|20101221145741.000|TR0|imagine how that felt.  Everyone at TCF 
20101221145741.000|20101221145743.000|TR0|stadium they're holding their breath.  
20101221145743.000|20101221145746.000|TR0|Obviously a tough hit.
20101221145746.000|20101221145748.000|TR0|
20101221145748.000|20101221145751.000|TR0|In the end, Favre suffered a concussion on 
20101221145751.000|20101221145753.000|TR0|the play and was replaced by rookie Joe 
20101221145753.000|20101221145755.000|TR0|Webb.  Webb actually was scheduled to 
20101221145755.000|20101221145758.000|TR0|start in the first place.  He did a pretty 
20101221145758.000|20101221145800.000|TR0|good job, but still, it was a backyard 
20101221145800.000|20101221145803.000|TR0|beat-down as I call it.  Bears top the 
20101221145803.000|20101221145805.000|TR0|Vikings 40-14.  They now won the NFC North.
20101221145805.000|20101221145808.000|TR0|
20101221145808.000|20101221145810.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Hey, and who thought collecting 
20101221145810.000|20101221145812.000|TR0|baseball cards could be worth so much 
20101221145812.000|20101221145815.000|TR0|money?  I wish my brother would've held on 
20101221145815.000|20101221145817.000|TR0|to his collection after hearing this story.
20101221145817.000|20101221145820.000|TR0|
20101221145820.000|20101221145822.000|TR0|MONTGOMERY:  Yes.  I might as well get to 
20101221145822.000|20101221145825.000|TR0|that.  A rare baseball card was obviously 
20101221145825.000|20101221145827.000|TR0|bequeathed to an order of Roman Catholic 
20101221145827.000|20101221145829.000|TR0|nuns in Baltimore, Maryland.  At an 
20101221145829.000|20101221145832.000|TR0|auction, it fetched $220,000.  The nuns 
20101221145832.000|20101221145834.000|TR0|were flying at such a high payday, right?
20101221145834.000|20101221145837.000|TR0|
20101221145837.000|20101221145839.000|TR0|Here's the thing, the winning bidder never 
20101221145839.000|20101221145841.000|TR0|paid.  So the auction house called up one 
20101221145841.000|20101221145844.000|TR0|of its long time clients, he's a 
20101221145844.000|20101221145846.000|TR0|cardiologist in Philadelphia.  He heard 
20101221145846.000|20101221145849.000|TR0|the story and he said, well, I'll buy it.  
20101221145849.000|20101221145851.000|TR0|So $220,000.
20101221145851.000|20101221145854.000|TR0|
20101221145854.000|20101221145856.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  He helped the nuns 
20101221145856.000|20101221145858.000|TR0|out.
20101221145858.000|20101221145901.000|TR0|
20101221145901.000|20101221145903.000|TR0|MONTGOMERY:  It hit the bank obviously -- 
20101221145903.000|20101221145906.000|TR0|well, actually yesterday.  The card is the 
20101221145906.000|20101221145908.000|TR0|Honus Wagner card, it's in poor condition, 
20101221145908.000|20101221145911.000|TR0|but considered to be the most sought-after 
20101221145911.000|20101221145913.000|TR0|baseball card in history. About 60 or so 
20101221145913.000|20101221145915.000|TR0|are known to exist.  So how about that?
20101221145915.000|20101221145918.000|TR0|
20101221145918.000|20101221145920.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  I 
20101221145920.000|20101221145923.000|TR0|wonder if my brother had one of those.  
20101221145923.000|20101221145925.000|TR0|I'm going to have to ask him.
20101221145925.000|20101221145927.000|TR0|
20101221145927.000|20101221145928.000|TR0|
