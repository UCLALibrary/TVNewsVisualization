20101221140421.333|20101221140424.667|TR0|foreign ambassadors all came to
20101221140424.667|20101221140428.000|TR0|a thousands-strong demonstration
20101221140428.000|20101221140430.500|TR0|outside the government Building

20101221140433.000|20101221140435.500|TR0|Minsk. Despite calls to keep the
20101221140435.500|20101221140438.000|TR0|protests peaceful, some started
20101221140438.000|20101221140441.333|TR0|storming the building, smashing
20101221140441.333|20101221140444.667|TR0|windows and breaking down doors.
20101221140444.667|20101221140448.000|TR0|Riot police reacted immediately.
20101221140448.000|20101221140450.500|TR0|The result - over 600 people
20101221140450.500|20101221140453.000|TR0|detained, dozens, including RT's
20101221140453.000|20101221140455.500|TR0|camera crew, injured, hit with
20101221140455.500|20101221140458.000|TR0|police batons. At least 6 of the

20101221140501.333|20101221140504.667|TR0|also been arrested, many of them

20101221140510.500|20101221140513.000|TR0|OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE I was
20101221140513.000|20101221140515.500|TR0|with my husband in the hospital
20101221140515.500|20101221140518.000|TR0|when several men entered the
20101221140518.000|20101221140521.333|TR0|room. They held me down. I was
20101221140521.333|20101221140524.667|TR0|trying to free myself, I was
20101221140524.667|20101221140528.000|TR0|screaming, but no-one came to
20101221140528.000|20101221140530.500|TR0|help. They pulled him off the
20101221140530.500|20101221140533.000|TR0|bed. He could not walk, so they
20101221140533.000|20101221140535.500|TR0|wrapped him in a blanket,
20101221140535.500|20101221140538.000|TR0|dragged him out of the room and
20101221140538.000|20101221140541.333|TR0|locked me inside. EU and US
20101221140541.333|20101221140544.667|TR0|officials have already condemned
20101221140544.667|20101221140548.000|TR0|the violence - but as with the
20101221140548.000|20101221140550.500|TR0|observers, President Aleksandr
20101221140550.500|20101221140553.000|TR0|Lukashenko simply told everyone
20101221140553.000|20101221140555.500|TR0|to mind their own business. SB:

20101221140558.000|20101221140601.333|TR0|the OSCE forgets that it came to
20101221140601.333|20101221140604.667|TR0|observe the election not to
20101221140604.667|20101221140608.000|TR0|control it. When it comes to
20101221140608.000|20101221140610.500|TR0|that it is not for them to
20101221140610.500|20101221140613.000|TR0|evaluate. Europe's last
20101221140613.000|20101221140615.500|TR0|dictator, as he has been dubbed
20101221140615.500|20101221140618.000|TR0|in some Western media, did
20101221140618.000|20101221140621.333|TR0|receive some praise from
20101221140621.333|20101221140624.667|TR0|observers. They've all agreed
20101221140624.667|20101221140628.000|TR0|this election was much more
20101221140628.000|20101221140630.500|TR0|democratic than the previous
20101221140630.500|20101221140633.000|TR0|one, in 2006. The relative
20101221140633.000|20101221140635.500|TR0|freedoms given to opposition
20101221140635.500|20101221140638.000|TR0|candidates in the run up to
20101221140638.000|20101221140641.333|TR0|Election Day was marked as a
20101221140641.333|20101221140644.667|TR0|positive sign. But sceptics say
20101221140644.667|20101221140648.000|TR0|that too, was just a ruse. The
20101221140648.000|20101221140650.500|TR0|EU promised Belarus billions of
20101221140650.500|20101221140653.000|TR0|euros if there are signs of free
20101221140653.000|20101221140655.500|TR0|and fair elections. Whether
20101221140655.500|20101221140658.000|TR0|Lukashenko will be able to
20101221140658.000|20101221140701.333|TR0|collect some cash from the EU

20101221140744.667|20101221140748.000|TR0|puzzled by the comments because
20101221140748.000|20101221140750.500|TR0|Polish officials were present at
20101221140750.500|20101221140753.000|TR0|all stages of the
20101221140753.000|20101221140755.500|TR0|identification. Earlier, Warsaw
20101221140755.500|20101221140758.000|TR0|rejected the findings of the
20101221140758.000|20101221140801.333|TR0|investigation into the April
20101221140801.333|20101221140804.667|TR0|plane crash. The report
20101221140804.667|20101221140808.000|TR0|concluded that pilot error was
20101221140808.000|20101221140810.500|TR0|among the main causes of the
20101221140810.500|20101221140813.000|TR0|fatal accident that killed 96.
20101221140813.000|20101221140815.500|TR0|The Polish Prime Minister has
20101221140815.500|20101221140818.000|TR0|called the findings unacceptable
20101221140818.000|20101221140821.333|TR0|and groundless. Aviation expert
20101221140821.333|20101221140824.667|TR0|Chris Yates says the Russian
20101221140824.667|20101221140828.000|TR0|investigation was thorough - and
20101221140828.000|20101221140830.500|TR0|no further international inquiry
20101221140830.500|20101221140833.000|TR0|is needed.

20101221141044.667|20101221141048.000|TR0|says he's fighting an

20101221141050.500|20101221141053.000|TR0|because he won't be treated
20101221141053.000|20101221141055.500|TR0|fairly there. Assange, who's in
20101221141055.500|20101221141058.000|TR0|the UK on bail, is due to face

20101221141148.000|20101221141150.500|TR0|now, Sweden is requesting
20101221141150.500|20101221141153.000|TR0|Assanges extradition from the
20101221141153.000|20101221141155.500|TR0|UK for having unprotected sex

20101221141208.000|20101221141210.500|TR0|Assange allegedly refused to
20101221141210.500|20101221141213.000|TR0|wear a condom - and its a crime
20101221141213.000|20101221141215.500|TR0|unique to Sweden. Here in the

20101221141228.000|20101221141230.500|TR0|seems ridiculous to me, it
20101221141230.500|20101221141233.000|TR0|dimishes victims of rape, its
20101221141233.000|20101221141235.500|TR0|an injustice not only to Julian

20101221141238.000|20101221141241.333|TR0|rape. Even in Sweden, the
20101221141241.333|20101221141244.667|TR0|original prosecutor threw the
20101221141244.667|20101221141248.000|TR0|allegations out, on lack of
20101221141248.000|20101221141250.500|TR0|merit. Then, Assange began the
20101221141250.500|20101221141253.000|TR0|release of 250,000 US diplomatic
20101221141253.000|20101221141255.500|TR0|cables - revealing and

20101221141258.000|20101221141301.333|TR0|government. All of a sudden,
20101221141301.333|20101221141304.667|TR0|Swedens director of public
20101221141304.667|20101221141308.000|TR0|prosecutions decided the rape
20101221141308.000|20101221141310.500|TR0|claims WERE valid - and Sweden
20101221141310.500|20101221141313.000|TR0|swallowed it whole, including

20101221141923.000|20101221141925.500|TR0|had promised to respond

20101221141934.667|20101221141938.000|TR0|with North Korea, had urged the

20101221142000.500|20101221142003.000|TR0|across Europe. Britain is one of
20101221142003.000|20101221142005.500|TR0|the worst affected so far, with
20101221142005.500|20101221142008.000|TR0|tens of thousands stranded.

20101221142034.667|20101221142038.000|TR0|unacceptable and saying it could
20101221142038.000|20101221142040.500|TR0|lead to tighter regulation.

20101221142631.333|20101221142634.667|TR0|After almost a year of
20101221142634.667|20101221142638.000|TR0|negotiation Gazprom has agreed
20101221142638.000|20101221142640.500|TR0|to sell gas to Latvia at a 15
20101221142640.500|20101221142643.000|TR0|pecent discount. The deal will
20101221142643.000|20101221142645.500|TR0|come into effect next year.
20101221142645.500|20101221142648.000|TR0|
20101221142648.000|20101221142651.333|TR0|Meanwhile, the company says it
20101221142651.333|20101221142654.667|TR0|will raise production by up to
20101221142654.667|20101221142658.000|TR0|14 percent by 2015. That amounts
20101221142658.000|20101221142700.500|TR0|to 580 billion cubic meters of
20101221142700.500|20101221142703.000|TR0|gas a year. Gazprom says the
20101221142703.000|20101221142705.500|TR0|plans are based on developments
20101221142705.500|20101221142708.000|TR0|in the domestic and external gas
20101221142708.000|20101221142711.333|TR0|market. It expects to produce
20101221142711.333|20101221142714.667|TR0|just over 500 billion cubic
20101221142714.667|20101221142718.000|TR0|meters of gas this year.

20101221142754.667|20101221142758.000|TR0|meanwhile, shrug off news that
20101221142758.000|20101221142800.500|TR0|Portugals credit rating may be

20101221142840.500|20101221142843.000|TR0|after Russia raised its forecast

20101221142845.500|20101221142848.000|TR0|from 75 to 81 dollars a barrel.

20101221142851.333|20101221142854.667|TR0|after reporting a 3-fold

20101221142914.667|20101221142918.000|TR0|collapsed Russian banks.
20101221142918.000|20101221142920.500|TR0|Meanwhile, the Central Bank has
20101221142920.500|20101221142923.000|TR0|withdrawn the licenses of
20101221142923.000|20101221142925.500|TR0|several banks. These include
20101221142925.500|20101221142928.000|TR0|Donbank, which is part of a
20101221142928.000|20101221142931.333|TR0|group of financial institutions
20101221142931.333|20101221142934.667|TR0|which will cost the agency 350
20101221142934.667|20101221142938.000|TR0|million dollars, according to
20101221142938.000|20101221142940.500|TR0|its deputy director.
20101221142940.500|20101221142943.000|TR0|
20101221142943.000|20101221142945.500|TR0|All these banks have failed for
20101221142945.500|20101221142948.000|TR0|the same reason, which is, quite
20101221142948.000|20101221142951.333|TR0|simply, the theft of assets. But
20101221142951.333|20101221142954.667|TR0|the problems have all been dealt
20101221142954.667|20101221142958.000|TR0|with and are finished now. The
20101221142958.000|20101221143000.500|TR0|financial group in question was
20101221143000.500|20101221143003.000|TR0|a combination of five banks and
20101221143003.000|20101221143005.500|TR0|all these banks have been shut
20101221143005.500|20101221143008.000|TR0|down. We're looking at immediate
20101221143008.000|20101221143011.333|TR0|payments of about 350 million
20101221143011.333|20101221143014.667|TR0|dollars and by the end of this
20101221143014.667|20101221143018.000|TR0|year we will have to pay around
20101221143018.000|20101221143020.500|TR0|480 million dollars. This will
20101221143020.500|20101221143023.000|TR0|not have a particularly negative
20101221143023.000|20101221143025.500|TR0|impact on the agency, but will
20101221143025.500|20101221143028.000|TR0|slow our growth.  I think
20101221143028.000|20101221143031.333|TR0|Russia`s system of deposit
20101221143031.333|20101221143034.667|TR0|insurance is one of the most
20101221143034.667|20101221143038.000|TR0|capitalized in the world. We
20101221143038.000|20101221143040.500|TR0|forecast that the fund will grow
20101221143040.500|20101221143043.000|TR0|by one billion euros in 2011 and
20101221143043.000|20101221143045.500|TR0|even more in 2012 .
