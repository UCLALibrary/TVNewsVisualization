20101214230754.333|20101214230756.000|CCO|OPRAH: SO IS IT AFTER HIS DEATH

20101214234349.000|20101214234351.000|CCO|AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

20101214234405.000|20101214234407.000|CCO|BE LIKE THAT, BUT I WAS. AND HE 
20101214234407.000|20101214234409.000|CCO|WAS ASKING ME--HE WANTED TO TELL

20101214234424.333|20101214234426.000|CCO|INDIFFERENT, AND HE DIDN'T LIKE
20101214234426.000|20101214234427.667|CCO|THAT WORD. AND HE CRIED AND HE
20101214234427.667|20101214234429.333|CCO|WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT 
20101214234429.333|20101214234431.000|CCO|WHERE I WAS AT AND HOW I COULD
20101214234431.000|20101214234433.000|CCO|BECOME SO DETACHED. AND THEN THE

20101214234435.000|20101214234437.000|CCO|WAS HIM TELLING ME THAT HE FELT
20101214234437.000|20101214234439.000|CCO|THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING TO TRY
20101214234439.000|20101214234441.000|CCO|AND KILL HIM TO GET AHOLD OF HIS

20101214234827.000|20101214234829.000|CCO|>> THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY NOT 
20101214234829.000|20101214234831.000|CCO|IN ANY WAY. I DID NOT SEE
20101214234831.000|20101214234832.667|CCO|ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 
20101214234832.667|20101214234834.333|CCO|OPRAH: SO BY 2005, I THINK, WHEN
20101214234834.333|20101214234836.000|CCO|HE WAS ON TRIAL FOR THE SECOND
20101214234836.000|20101214234837.667|CCO|CHARGE, YOUR FEELINGS AT THAT
20101214234837.667|20101214234839.333|CCO|TIME WERE WHAT? DID HE EVER TALK
20101214234839.333|20101214234841.000|CCO|TO YOU ABOUT IT?
20101214234841.000|20101214234842.429|CCO|>> HE WAS CALLING ME ABOUT IT,
20101214234842.429|20101214234843.857|CCO|AND I SAID, "PLEASE KEEP YOUR
20101214234843.857|20101214234845.286|CCO|HEAD TOGETHER. PLEASE. IF THIS

20101214234846.714|20101214234848.143|CCO|TOGETHER," AND HE SAID, "WHAT

20101214234849.571|20101214234851.000|CCO|YOU MEAN?" AND HE SAYS, "YOU
20101214234851.000|20101214234852.429|CCO|MEAN DRUGS?" I SAID, "YES." 
20101214234852.429|20101214234853.857|CCO|BECAUSE ALL I SAW--YOU KNOW,
20101214234853.857|20101214234855.286|CCO|THERE WAS A FEW-YEAR PERIOD 
20101214234855.286|20101214234856.714|CCO|THERE WHERE RANDOM THINGS WERE
20101214234856.714|20101214234858.143|CCO|COMING OUT, WHETHER IT WAS A

20101214234859.571|20101214234901.000|CCO|VARIOUS INTERVIEWS. AND IN THOSE
20101214234901.000|20101214234902.667|CCO|INTERVIEWS, I SAW HIM
20101214234902.667|20101214234904.333|CCO|INTOXICATED. I DIDN'T SEE 
20101214234904.333|20101214234906.000|CCO|MICHAEL THAT I KNEW IN THAT
20101214234906.000|20101214234907.667|CCO|MARTIN BASHIR INTERVIEW. HE WAS 
20101214234907.667|20101214234909.333|CCO|HIGH AS A KITE, FROM WHAT I SAW
20101214234909.333|20101214234911.000|CCO|AND FROM WHAT I KNEW. 
20101214234911.000|20101214234912.429|CCO|OPRAH: REALLY?
20101214234912.429|20101214234913.857|CCO|>> HE WAS EITHER TOO SPEEDY OR
20101214234913.857|20101214234915.286|CCO|HE WAS SEDATED. IT WASN'T THE 
20101214234915.286|20101214234916.714|CCO|MICHAEL THAT I KNEW.
20101214234916.714|20101214234918.143|CCO|OPRAH: THE SHOCKING THINGS--HE
20101214234918.143|20101214234919.571|CCO|SAID SOME PRETTY SHOCKING THINGS
20101214234919.571|20101214234921.000|CCO|IN THAT MARTIN BASHIR INTERVIEW,
20101214234921.000|20101214234923.000|CCO|PARTICULARLY ABOUT HOW HE FELT
20101214234923.000|20101214234925.000|CCO|IT WAS OK TO SLEEP WITH YOUNG
20101214234925.000|20101214234927.000|CCO|CHILDREN. 
20101214234927.000|20101214234929.000|CCO|>> I THINK HE SAID THAT STUFF 
20101214234929.000|20101214234931.000|CCO|SOMETIMES TO BE DEFIANT BECAUSE
20101214234931.000|20101214234932.667|CCO|HE GOT SO ANGRY AT HAVING BEEN
20101214234932.667|20101214234934.333|CCO|ACCUSED--I THINK THAT SOMETIMES 
20101214234934.333|20101214234936.000|CCO|HE WAS SUCH A LITTLE STUBBORN
20101214234936.000|20101214234937.667|CCO|REBEL SOMETIMES, AND HE WAS LIKE
20101214234937.667|20101214234939.333|CCO|A CHILD, AND HE WOULD JUST SAY
20101214234939.333|20101214234941.000|CCO|WHAT HE FELT EVERYONE DIDN'T
20101214234941.000|20101214234942.667|CCO|WANT HIM TO SAY.
20101214234942.667|20101214234944.333|CCO|OPRAH: MM-HMM.
20101214234944.333|20101214234946.000|CCO|>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE HE HAD A 
20101214234946.000|20101214234947.667|CCO|STRAIGHT HEAD DURING THOSE
20101214234947.667|20101214234949.333|CCO|THINGS. AND I THINK THAT THEY

20101214235001.000|20101214235002.429|CCO|>> NO. I MEAN, I HONESTLY CANNOT

20101214235003.857|20101214235005.286|CCO|EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO
