20101214081727.000|20101214081728.667|CCO|>> Rose: MY ARGUMENT IS THAT THE
20101214081728.667|20101214081730.333|CCO|FUTURE BELONGS TO TWO KINDS OF
20101214081730.333|20101214081732.000|CCO|PEOPLE.
20101214081732.000|20101214081733.111|CCO|ONE, BIG IDEAS BUT ALSO LEADERS

20101214081734.222|20101214081735.333|CCO|AND THEREFORE THAT THE
20101214081735.333|20101214081736.444|CCO|LEADERSHIP COMPONENT OF THAT IS
20101214081736.444|20101214081737.556|CCO|VERY IMPORTANT.
20101214081737.556|20101214081738.667|CCO|THAT'S MY ARGUMENT.
20101214081738.667|20101214081739.778|CCO|>> I DO AGREE WITH YOU.

20101214081746.000|20101214081748.000|CCO|I'VE ALWAYS SAID THE DEFINITION
20101214081748.000|20101214081750.000|CCO|OF COURAGE IS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO

20101214081752.000|20101214081753.667|CCO|YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A STRONG OF

20101214081802.000|20101214081803.250|CCO|AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT
20101214081803.250|20101214081804.500|CCO|LEADERSHIP ABOUT.
20101214081804.500|20101214081805.750|CCO|AND I THINK IF YOU DON'T HAVE

20101214081816.286|20101214081817.714|CCO|THEN YOU CAN'T BE LABELED AS A

20101214081819.143|20101214081820.571|CCO|AND I THINK COURAGEOUS LEADERS
20101214081820.571|20101214081822.000|CCO|DO BOTH.
20101214081822.000|20101214081823.429|CCO|>> BUT THAT'S EXACTLY ARGUMENT

20101214081827.714|20101214081829.143|CCO|COURAGEOUS LEADER?
20101214081829.143|20101214081830.571|CCO|>> WELL, IRAQ WAS REALLY THREE

20101214081832.000|20101214081833.429|CCO|LET'S BE HONEST.
20101214081833.429|20101214081834.857|CCO|THE REASON THERE'S A DISPUTE

20101214081843.667|20101214081845.333|CCO|SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD BROKEN EVERY

20101214081854.857|20101214081856.286|CCO|WAS A FAILURE OF RECONSTRUCTION.
20101214081856.286|20101214081857.714|CCO|THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
20101214081857.714|20101214081859.143|CCO|SO WE'VE ALL GOT TO ACCEPT BLAME
20101214081859.143|20101214081900.571|CCO|FOR THAT.
20101214081900.571|20101214081902.000|CCO|AND WE DIDN'T RECONSTRUCT IRAQ
20101214081902.000|20101214081903.667|CCO|AND THEREFORE THE CONFLICT WAS
20101214081903.667|20101214081905.333|CCO|PROLONGED.
20101214081905.333|20101214081907.000|CCO|THE QUESTION, OF COURSE, THE

20101214081910.333|20101214081912.000|CCO|TIME IS WHETHER SADDAM HUSSEIN

20101214081913.111|20101214081914.222|CCO|THERE BEING INTERNATIONAL
20101214081914.222|20101214081915.333|CCO|INTERVENTION.
20101214081915.333|20101214081916.444|CCO|OUR JUDGMENT WAS THAT WE HAD TO

20101214081918.667|20101214081919.778|CCO|HISTORY WILL TELL US MORE

20101214081925.333|20101214081927.000|CCO|AND THEREFORE THAT'S WHY SUCH A
20101214081927.000|20101214081928.667|CCO|DISPUTE, IRAQ.
20101214081928.667|20101214081930.333|CCO|BECAUSE THERE IS A DEBATE ABOUT

20101214081948.000|20101214081950.000|CCO|BUT THIS QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER
