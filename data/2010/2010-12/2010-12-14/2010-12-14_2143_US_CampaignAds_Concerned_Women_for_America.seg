bainer gained about forty five seats in the midterm elections also republican congressman joe kits will share a key health subcommittee it is fox pits received the endorsement of the national right to life committee all this is setting this up for the stage for the showdown on abortion in the new year the hundreds of congress heading ences the c_e_o_ of concerned women for america and gloria feltler is the author of no excuses nine ways women can change how we think about powers is also a former president of planned parenthood penny i want to start with you and what his job it's being to the antiabortion rights movement well jeff katz is going to be the new chairman anthony and the house subcommittee and you could understand that so has the job because american women dot fifteen points wind this past election four this congress we have a pro-life house of representatives we have a pro-life house leadership and we have twelve a new senators who are pro-life and something else that's going to change the dynamics on capitol hill yea in america and we can afford to continue to fund organizations like planned parenthood the nation's largest abortion provider in the country let's talk about the statistics you just brought up as we move into the hundreds of congress i want to move over to glory here who has observed the electric spoken in terms of what they want in terms of course rights by seeing this wave of republicans uh... happens now if you had a lot of the electorate speaks every couple of years and the electorate spoke in loud terms in two thousand eight so what we're seeing is a swing that is going to are very very badly for women's human right to make our own canterbury decisions without government interference baghdad's really what we're going to find out think that the voters who are keen on that issue they working on the economy they're working on many other things they were frustrated i think with some lack of leadership are on the part of the obama administration to really articulate what was needed to to happen in health care and look joke it's heat heat eat really is about deep six ng health care reform by any means i think that is really been his strategy and i'm sorry to say that's women's bodies in women ties are very good brent sadler before yes you penny with me my deep six and what what do you think she wants to do well at he can't jump jump jets is clearly in the pocket of the big pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies head for example heated voted to prevent medicare plan do you for being able to negotiate lower prices for people like me for our drugs adding this is this is much bigger than the abortion issue the abortion issue it is a foot finger on the freeway saying that he was fired if you're defining it if you're defining help for women as abortion and federal funding for abortion yes that's going to be a problem for you jeff katz has been a champion for american women changing for the unborn and we've pushed very hard for him to have that slot we believe he'll be a great job and it's very important that hit that we had people who can mess that understand that we can afford it three hundred million dollars a year to go pay to pay for organizations that promote abortion lot plan your next week we have a fourteen trillion dollar debt hanging over the head at every man or woman child in this country anyone who knows how to relax sherita paying for things that we don't need to know on sub look at your press release that so you released only days ago at you were alluding to that spending what are some of the things you are suggesting should be passed in this new congress eking out an evite any format funding for abortion you got the chris smith bat lipinski bail which is a democrat republican append to gether and have a bill that would prohibit funding for abortion on any levels by the way the vast majority of americans agree with us on this issue clear about that out you guys plenty of funding for abortions and they have right now i know ross and he ran head and that is the nation's largest abortion provider passed through shorty of what you do is abortion you get three hundred million dollars a year of arafat's dollars that we can all that he will respond to this and gloria please so i think i know we're going with this all okay first of all let me just make clear iron here's a spokesperson for myself as a women's rights advocate along standing you're welcome to have somebody from planned parenthood to address those issues i'm going to talk about what i think the real issues are if you do what you will be seeing from this congress is not just attacks on the right to choose when it comes to abortion what you're going to see from this congress is a reinstitution of the global gag rule you're going to see attacks on family planning pre-date his services preventive services that they deserve because there is a very different way of doing that and i don't know what's up and by the way to prevent abortion is to make sure that birth control another family planning services are part of any health plan and what we're seeing now is on the state level and with the now the aid and assistance of members of congress like congressman pitts to keep those kinds of preventive health care services out the health care plan if even a health care plan exists after this congress is dead and how important or those health care services of preventive services that you just described indian leading up to an abortion question poets it looked very there at basic health care bracket actually ninety five percent of americans use his birth control at some point in their lives because we do it because we're responsible we do it to be healthy we do have to have healthy pregnancies and to be able to plan in space are families responsibly alright penny just for balancing it of course give you a last word here part is that fine with you uh... what we're talking about here today i would read abortion verses these preventive services track investment out is not over a birth control this back elysa but that's about abortive faces and it's a black abortion and how our tax dollars are going to be spent going forward we're telling you we can afford in this is a message that concerned women for america will be given to congress pettiness chlorophyll thank you so much for both of your times today as we
