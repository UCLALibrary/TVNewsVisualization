20101214014716.000|20101214014718.000|CCO|AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT IS

20101214014904.000|20101214014906.000|CCO|AND CERTAINLY SOMEBODY WHO COULD

20101214014908.000|20101214014910.000|CCO|AND TO MOBILIZE THE RESOURCES.
20101214014910.000|20101214014912.000|CCO|HE BUILT A TERRIFIC STAFF

20101214014922.000|20101214014924.500|CCO|I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 
20101214014924.500|20101214014927.000|CCO|TOUGH FOR ANY REPLACEMENT TO BE

20101214014933.250|20101214014934.500|CCO|OF PEOPLE AND THAT'S A TOUGH 
20101214014934.500|20101214014935.750|CCO|THING FOR PEOPLE TO DO IN

20101214014942.000|20101214014944.000|CCO|BECAUSE YOU SAID HE WAS WELL

20101214014946.000|20101214014948.000|CCO|I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
20101214014948.000|20101214014950.000|CCO|DID HE THINK IT WAS FUTILE OR 
20101214014950.000|20101214014952.000|CCO|DID HE JUST THINK WE HAD TO 
20101214014952.000|20101214014953.667|CCO|KNOCK KARZAI OUT OR WE HAD -- 
20101214014953.667|20101214014955.333|CCO|THAT SOME REPLACEMENT -- HE

20101214015002.000|20101214015004.000|CCO|WHAT -- WHAT WAS IT -- DID HE

20101214015025.333|20101214015027.000|CCO|CERTAINLY, I THINK, HE WAS
