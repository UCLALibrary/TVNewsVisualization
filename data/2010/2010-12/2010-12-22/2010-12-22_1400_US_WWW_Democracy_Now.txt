20101222140038.726|20101222140040.428|TR0|according to a report by 
20101222140040.428|20101222140042.131|TR0|ProPublica. The administration

20101222141402.266|20101222141403.968|TR0|government and making it a tool 
20101222141403.968|20101222141405.671|TR0|of political empowerment for 
20101222141405.671|20101222141407.373|TR0|citizens over their government. 
20101222141407.373|20101222141409.076|TR0|We cannot be a representative 
20101222141409.076|20101222141410.778|TR0|government without being able to 
20101222141410.778|20101222141412.480|TR0|apportion our House of 
20101222141412.480|20101222141414.183|TR0|Representatives in a way that 
20101222141414.183|20101222141415.885|TR0|reflects the changing nation of 
20101222141415.885|20101222141417.588|TR0|the past two centuries. And that 
20101222141417.588|20101222141419.290|TR0|requires us to know who lives 
20101222141419.290|20101222141420.993|TR0|where. It requires a population 
20101222141420.993|20101222141422.695|TR0|census.

20101222141424.397|20101222141426.100|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Republicans are 
20101222141426.100|20101222141427.802|TR0|widely expected to benefit from 
20101222141427.802|20101222141429.505|TR0|the new political map. The 
20101222141429.505|20101222141431.207|TR0|Census Bureau took seats from 
20101222141431.207|20101222141432.909|TR0|traditionally Democratic states 
20101222141432.909|20101222141434.612|TR0|such as New York and 
20101222141434.612|20101222141436.314|TR0|Massachusetts and added them to 
20101222141436.314|20101222141438.017|TR0|Republican-leaning states such 
20101222141438.017|20101222141439.719|TR0|as Arizona and Texas, which 
20101222141439.719|20101222141441.421|TR0|picked up four additional seats. 
20101222141441.421|20101222141443.124|TR0|Of the 10 states to lose seats, 
20101222141443.124|20101222141444.826|TR0|eight voted for President Obama 
20101222141444.826|20101222141446.529|TR0|in the 2008 elections.

20101222141448.231|20101222141449.934|TR0|The reapportionment towards 
20101222141449.934|20101222141451.636|TR0|Republican-leaning states also 
20101222141451.636|20101222141453.338|TR0|follows major Republican gains 
20101222141453.338|20101222141455.041|TR0|in last month's midterm 
20101222141455.041|20101222141456.743|TR0|elections. Those wins will have 
20101222141456.743|20101222141458.446|TR0|a big impact when state 
20101222141458.446|20101222141500.148|TR0|lawmakers redraw the district 
20101222141500.148|20101222141501.850|TR0|boundaries for the House of 
20101222141501.850|20101222141503.553|TR0|Representatives.
20101222141503.553|20101222141505.255|TR0|
20101222141505.255|20101222141506.958|TR0|One of the most high-profile 
20101222141506.958|20101222141508.660|TR0|lawmakers who could be impacted 
20101222141508.660|20101222141510.363|TR0|by the redistricting is 
20101222141510.363|20101222141512.065|TR0|Democratic Congress member 
20101222141512.065|20101222141513.767|TR0|Dennis Kucinich of Ohio. He lost 
20101222141513.767|20101222141515.470|TR0|two congressional seats in the 
20101222141515.470|20101222141517.172|TR0|census reapportionment - Ohio 
20101222141517.172|20101222141518.875|TR0|did. That means Republican 
20101222141518.875|20101222141520.577|TR0|lawmakers could carve up 
20101222141520.577|20101222141522.279|TR0|Kucinich's district when it 
20101222141522.279|20101222141523.982|TR0|comes time to eliminate those 
20101222141523.982|20101222141525.684|TR0|two seats.
20101222141525.684|20101222141527.387|TR0|
20101222141527.387|20101222141529.089|TR0|Overall, the census found the 
20101222141529.089|20101222141530.792|TR0|population has grown 9.7 percent 
20101222141530.792|20101222141532.494|TR0|since 2000 to over 308 million 
20101222141532.494|20101222141534.196|TR0|residents. It was the slowest 
20101222141534.196|20101222141535.899|TR0|rate of growth, population, 
20101222141535.899|20101222141537.601|TR0|since 1940.

20101222141539.304|20101222141541.006|TR0|For more on the census 
20101222141541.006|20101222141542.708|TR0|redistricting and what it means 
20101222141542.708|20101222141544.411|TR0|for the nation's political 
20101222141544.411|20101222141546.113|TR0|landscape, I'm joined by Tim 
20101222141546.113|20101222141547.816|TR0|Storey. He's a senior fellow at 
20101222141547.816|20101222141549.518|TR0|the National Conference of 
20101222141549.518|20101222141551.221|TR0|Legislatures. He joins us now 
20101222141551.221|20101222141552.923|TR0|from Denver.
20101222141552.923|20101222141554.625|TR0|
20101222141554.625|20101222141556.328|TR0|Welcome to Democracy Now!, Tim 
20101222141556.328|20101222141558.030|TR0|Storey. Talk about the 
20101222141558.030|20101222141559.733|TR0|significance, what you think are 
20101222141559.733|20101222141601.435|TR0|the most important shifts that 
20101222141601.435|20101222141603.137|TR0|you see in the 2010 Census.
20101222141603.137|20101222141604.840|TR0|
20101222141604.840|20101222141606.542|TR0|>> TIM STOREY: Amy, thank you 
20101222141606.542|20101222141608.245|TR0|for inviting me to be on the 
20101222141608.245|20101222141609.947|TR0|show.
20101222141609.947|20101222141611.649|TR0|
20101222141611.649|20101222141613.352|TR0|There were a number of 
20101222141613.352|20101222141615.054|TR0|interesting things that we 
20101222141615.054|20101222141616.757|TR0|discovered yesterday when the 
20101222141616.757|20101222141618.459|TR0|Census Bureau released its new 
20101222141618.459|20101222141620.162|TR0|apportionment numbers, and this 
20101222141620.162|20101222141621.864|TR0|is really just a kind of the 
20101222141621.864|20101222141623.566|TR0|first taste of the wealth of 
20101222141623.566|20101222141625.269|TR0|data that's going to come out 
20101222141625.269|20101222141626.971|TR0|from the 2010 Census. Most of 
20101222141626.971|20101222141628.674|TR0|that will start rolling out in 
20101222141628.674|20101222141630.376|TR0|February of next year and 
20101222141630.376|20101222141632.078|TR0|through March of next year. But 
20101222141632.078|20101222141633.781|TR0|what we saw yesterday was - I 
20101222141633.781|20101222141635.483|TR0|think there weren't a lot of 
20101222141635.483|20101222141637.186|TR0|surprises, actually. The 
20101222141637.186|20101222141638.888|TR0|projections and the estimates 
20101222141638.888|20101222141640.591|TR0|that we had before the release 
20101222141640.591|20101222141642.293|TR0|of the data gave us a pretty 
20101222141642.293|20101222141643.995|TR0|good idea of where the shifts 
20101222141643.995|20101222141645.698|TR0|were going to take place.
20101222141645.698|20101222141647.400|TR0|
20101222141647.400|20101222141649.103|TR0|What we found, what was 
20101222141649.103|20101222141650.805|TR0|confirmed yesterday, is that the 
20101222141650.805|20101222141652.507|TR0|rate of growth in some of the 
20101222141652.507|20101222141654.210|TR0|Southern states, the Sun Belt 
20101222141654.210|20101222141655.912|TR0|states and Western states is 
20101222141655.912|20101222141657.615|TR0|outpacing at a pretty good clip 
20101222141657.615|20101222141659.317|TR0|the rate of growth in the 
20101222141659.317|20101222141701.020|TR0|Northeast and the Great Lakes 
20101222141701.020|20101222141702.722|TR0|states. In fact, the state of 
20101222141702.722|20101222141704.424|TR0|Michigan actually declined in 
20101222141704.424|20101222141706.127|TR0|population from the 2000 Census. 
20101222141706.127|20101222141707.829|TR0|It was the only state that 
20101222141707.829|20101222141709.532|TR0|literally lost population during 
20101222141709.532|20101222141711.234|TR0|the decade. So, states like 
20101222141711.234|20101222141712.936|TR0|Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, 
20101222141712.936|20101222141714.639|TR0|you know, gaining both 
20101222141714.639|20101222141716.341|TR0|population - almost every state, 
20101222141716.341|20101222141718.044|TR0|as I said, has gained in 
20101222141718.044|20101222141719.746|TR0|populations. These states are 
20101222141719.746|20101222141721.449|TR0|growing at a faster rate. So 
20101222141721.449|20101222141723.151|TR0|that translates into direct 
20101222141723.151|20101222141724.853|TR0|political power, political 
20101222141724.853|20101222141726.556|TR0|influence in the U.S. House of 
20101222141726.556|20101222141728.258|TR0|Representatives. It also 
20101222141728.258|20101222141729.961|TR0|translates into electoral 
20101222141729.961|20101222141731.663|TR0|college votes, because the 
20101222141731.663|20101222141733.365|TR0|electoral college totals for 
20101222141733.365|20101222141735.068|TR0|each state are based on the U.S. 
20101222141735.068|20101222141736.770|TR0|House seats. So, there weren't a 
20101222141736.770|20101222141738.473|TR0|lot of surprises based on the 
20101222141738.473|20101222141740.175|TR0|projections, but it did sort of 
20101222141740.175|20101222141741.877|TR0|confirm what we've known, is 
20101222141741.877|20101222141743.580|TR0|that the population is shifting 
20101222141743.580|20101222141745.282|TR0|to the South and the West and 
20101222141745.282|20101222141746.985|TR0|that the Great Lakes states, the 
20101222141746.985|20101222141748.687|TR0|Northeastern states are losing 
20101222141748.687|20101222141750.390|TR0|population.
20101222141750.390|20101222141752.092|TR0|
20101222141752.092|20101222141753.794|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: As it shifts, 
20101222141753.794|20101222141755.497|TR0|though, there is a 
20101222141755.497|20101222141757.199|TR0|countervailing story, which is 
20101222141757.199|20101222141758.902|TR0|the growth of Latinos in these 
20101222141758.902|20101222141800.604|TR0|what are called "red states," 
20101222141800.604|20101222141802.306|TR0|the significant growth in 
20101222141802.306|20101222141804.009|TR0|populations in places like, 
20101222141804.009|20101222141805.711|TR0|well, for example, Texas and 
20101222141805.711|20101222141807.414|TR0|Arizona, Tim Storey.
20101222141807.414|20101222141809.116|TR0|
20101222141809.116|20101222141810.819|TR0|>> TIM STOREY: That's right. 
20101222141810.819|20101222141812.521|TR0|That's right, Amy. We won't know 
20101222141812.521|20101222141814.223|TR0|exactly - we won't know the 
20101222141814.223|20101222141815.926|TR0|exact rate of growth among sort 
20101222141815.926|20101222141817.628|TR0|of demographic groups within the 
20101222141817.628|20101222141819.331|TR0|census until that data is 
20101222141819.331|20101222141821.033|TR0|released next year. But the 
20101222141821.033|20101222141822.735|TR0|Census Bureau has released some 
20101222141822.735|20101222141824.438|TR0|other survey-type data from the 
20101222141824.438|20101222141826.140|TR0|American Community Survey and 
20101222141826.140|20101222141827.843|TR0|demographic estimates. And from 
20101222141827.843|20101222141829.545|TR0|that data, what you're saying is 
20101222141829.545|20101222141831.248|TR0|true. We know that the Hispanic 
20101222141831.248|20101222141832.950|TR0|community in Texas and in 
20101222141832.950|20101222141834.652|TR0|Arizona, Nevada, is in many ways 
20101222141834.652|20101222141836.355|TR0|fueling the growth rate. They 
20101222141836.355|20101222141838.057|TR0|have higher birth rates within 
20101222141838.057|20101222141839.760|TR0|that community than other 
20101222141839.760|20101222141841.462|TR0|demographic segments, and so 
20101222141841.462|20101222141843.164|TR0|their population is growing at a 
20101222141843.164|20101222141844.867|TR0|much faster rate.
20101222141844.867|20101222141846.569|TR0|
20101222141846.569|20101222141848.272|TR0|And it raises some interesting 
20101222141848.272|20101222141849.974|TR0|questions about the 
20101222141849.974|20101222141851.676|TR0|redistricting that will follow 
20101222141851.676|20101222141853.379|TR0|this reapportionment - two 
20101222141853.379|20101222141855.081|TR0|different things, 
20101222141855.081|20101222141856.784|TR0|reapportionment and 
20101222141856.784|20101222141858.486|TR0|redistricting. And redistricting 
20101222141858.486|20101222141900.189|TR0|is the detailed realignment of 
20101222141900.189|20101222141901.891|TR0|districts to match the 
20101222141901.891|20101222141903.593|TR0|population shifts. All the 
20101222141903.593|20101222141905.296|TR0|districts have to be essentially 
20101222141905.296|20101222141906.998|TR0|even in population. And you have 
20101222141906.998|20101222141908.701|TR0|to draw the districts where the 
20101222141908.701|20101222141910.403|TR0|people are, where the growth is. 
20101222141910.403|20101222141912.105|TR0|So if Texas is growing and that 
20101222141912.105|20101222141913.808|TR0|growth is primarily in Hispanic 
20101222141913.808|20101222141915.510|TR0|areas - and, of course, you've 
20101222141915.510|20101222141917.213|TR0|also got the Voting Rights Act, 
20101222141917.213|20101222141918.915|TR0|which is a major influence on 
20101222141918.915|20101222141920.618|TR0|the redistricting process. So 
20101222141920.618|20101222141922.320|TR0|when state legislators in Texas 
20101222141922.320|20101222141924.022|TR0|draw these new districts, 
20101222141924.022|20101222141925.725|TR0|they're going to have to put 
20101222141925.725|20101222141927.427|TR0|them where the people are. And 
20101222141927.427|20101222141929.130|TR0|if that growth has been in 
20101222141929.130|20101222141930.832|TR0|Hispanic communities, then 
20101222141930.832|20101222141932.534|TR0|that's where the new seats are 
20101222141932.534|20101222141934.237|TR0|going to have to go.
20101222141934.237|20101222141935.939|TR0|
20101222141935.939|20101222141937.642|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Hispanics 
20101222141937.642|20101222141939.344|TR0|accounting for about half the 
20101222141939.344|20101222141941.047|TR0|population gains in Florida, 
20101222141941.047|20101222141942.749|TR0|Arizona, Nevada, Texas. In 
20101222141942.749|20101222141944.451|TR0|Georgia, African Americans and 
20101222141944.451|20101222141946.154|TR0|Hispanics contributing more than 
20101222141946.154|20101222141947.856|TR0|half the growth. Tim Storey, 
20101222141947.856|20101222141949.559|TR0|would you like to comment?
20101222141949.559|20101222141951.261|TR0|
20101222141951.261|20101222141952.963|TR0|>> TIM STOREY: You're exactly 
20101222141952.963|20101222141954.666|TR0|right, Amy. Yeah, you're exactly 
20101222141954.666|20101222141956.368|TR0|right. And traditionally 
20101222141956.368|20101222141958.071|TR0|minority communities are growing 
20101222141958.071|20101222141959.773|TR0|at a faster rate. And that could 
20101222141959.773|20101222142001.476|TR0|ultimately translate into 
20101222142001.476|20101222142003.178|TR0|political power both in Congress 
20101222142003.178|20101222142004.880|TR0|and also in state legislatures, 
20101222142004.880|20101222142006.583|TR0|because districts have to be 
20101222142006.583|20101222142008.285|TR0|based on population. The 
20101222142008.285|20101222142009.988|TR0|Constitution establishes the 
20101222142009.988|20101222142011.690|TR0|principle of one person, one 
20101222142011.690|20101222142013.392|TR0|vote. So the districts have to 
20101222142013.392|20101222142015.095|TR0|be essentially the same number 
20101222142015.095|20101222142016.797|TR0|of people, so that everybody's 
20101222142016.797|20101222142018.500|TR0|voice is equally represented in 
20101222142018.500|20101222142020.202|TR0|all legislative bodies, whether 
20101222142020.202|20101222142021.904|TR0|it's the U.S. House of 
20101222142021.904|20101222142023.607|TR0|Representatives, the state 
20101222142023.607|20101222142025.309|TR0|legislature, city councils, 
20101222142025.309|20101222142027.012|TR0|county commissions. Any elected 
20101222142027.012|20101222142028.714|TR0|body that's based on population, 
20101222142028.714|20101222142030.417|TR0|those districts now have to be 
20101222142030.417|20101222142032.119|TR0|redrawn so that they're even in 
20101222142032.119|20101222142033.821|TR0|population. And if population 
20101222142033.821|20101222142035.524|TR0|growth in minority communities 
20101222142035.524|20101222142037.226|TR0|has been faster, then that's 
20101222142037.226|20101222142038.929|TR0|going to be reflected in the 
20101222142038.929|20101222142040.631|TR0|upcoming redistricting.
20101222142040.631|20101222142042.333|TR0|
20101222142042.333|20101222142044.036|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I also have an 
20101222142044.036|20101222142045.738|TR0|interesting story with 
20101222142045.738|20101222142047.441|TR0|Washington, D.C. Washington, 
20101222142047.441|20101222142049.143|TR0|D.C., at this point, is not 
20101222142049.143|20101222142050.846|TR0|considered a state, but it is 
20101222142050.846|20101222142052.548|TR0|for the purposes of counting in 
20101222142052.548|20101222142054.250|TR0|the census, and it's a district 
20101222142054.250|20101222142055.953|TR0|that is actually becoming 
20101222142055.953|20101222142057.655|TR0|whiter. Is that right, Tim 
20101222142057.655|20101222142059.358|TR0|Storey?
20101222142059.358|20101222142101.060|TR0|
20101222142101.060|20101222142102.762|TR0|>> TIM STOREY: Well, again, the 
20101222142102.762|20101222142104.465|TR0|demographic data, which will 
20101222142104.465|20101222142106.167|TR0|sort of tell us the race and 
20101222142106.167|20101222142107.870|TR0|ethnicity within the population, 
20101222142107.870|20101222142109.572|TR0|that detailed data won't come 
20101222142109.572|20101222142111.275|TR0|out until next February, March. 
20101222142111.275|20101222142112.977|TR0|So, right now we have some 
20101222142112.977|20101222142114.679|TR0|estimates based on what's called 
20101222142114.679|20101222142116.382|TR0|the American Community Survey. 
20101222142116.382|20101222142118.084|TR0|And yes, my understanding, that 
20101222142118.084|20101222142119.787|TR0|the demographics of Washington 
20101222142119.787|20101222142121.489|TR0|is changing. But you're right. 
20101222142121.489|20101222142123.191|TR0|Washington does not have a seat 
20101222142123.191|20101222142124.894|TR0|in the U.S. House of 
20101222142124.894|20101222142126.596|TR0|Representatives.
20101222142126.596|20101222142128.299|TR0|
20101222142128.299|20101222142130.001|TR0|So, when you look at the overall 
20101222142130.001|20101222142131.704|TR0|population of a U.S. - a seat in 
20101222142131.704|20101222142133.406|TR0|the U.S. House, a U.S. 
20101222142133.406|20101222142135.108|TR0|representative, a member of 
20101222142135.108|20101222142136.811|TR0|Congress in the U.S. House, will 
20101222142136.811|20101222142138.513|TR0|represent about 710,000 people 
20101222142138.513|20101222142140.216|TR0|after this apportionment, so - 
20101222142140.216|20101222142141.918|TR0|on average. That varies greatly 
20101222142141.918|20101222142143.620|TR0|from state to state. In fact, in 
20101222142143.620|20101222142145.323|TR0|Montana, Montana isn't quite big 
20101222142145.323|20101222142147.025|TR0|enough to get a second seat in 
20101222142147.025|20101222142148.728|TR0|Congress. They only get one seat 
20101222142148.728|20101222142150.430|TR0|in Congress. And the population 
20101222142150.430|20101222142152.132|TR0|of Montana is just under a 
20101222142152.132|20101222142153.835|TR0|million people. So, the House 
20101222142153.835|20101222142155.537|TR0|member from Montana will 
20101222142155.537|20101222142157.240|TR0|actually represent a million 
20101222142157.240|20101222142158.942|TR0|people, and the House member 
20101222142158.942|20101222142200.645|TR0|from Wyoming will represent only 
20101222142200.645|20101222142202.347|TR0|about half a million people. So, 
20101222142202.347|20101222142204.049|TR0|the population can vary 
20101222142204.049|20101222142205.752|TR0|somewhat, but the District of 
20101222142205.752|20101222142207.454|TR0|Columbia actually has - does not 
20101222142207.454|20101222142209.157|TR0|have a member of the U.S. 
20101222142209.157|20101222142210.859|TR0|Congress that has voting rights 
20101222142210.859|20101222142212.561|TR0|on the floor. Of course, they 
20101222142212.561|20101222142214.264|TR0|have a delegate that's a member 
20101222142214.264|20101222142215.966|TR0|of committees and active in 
20101222142215.966|20101222142217.669|TR0|other ways in the House.
20101222142217.669|20101222142219.371|TR0|
20101222142219.371|20101222142221.074|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: There's an 
20101222142221.074|20101222142222.776|TR0|interesting piece in the 
20101222142222.776|20101222142224.478|TR0|Washington Post saying, 
20101222142224.478|20101222142226.181|TR0|"Reversing a half-century of 
20101222142226.181|20101222142227.883|TR0|decline, the District's 
20101222142227.883|20101222142229.586|TR0|population grew more than 5 
20101222142229.586|20101222142231.288|TR0|percent [...] and sailed past 
20101222142231.288|20101222142232.990|TR0|600,000 residents." And it says 
20101222142232.990|20101222142234.693|TR0|that the "growth has swelled the 
20101222142234.693|20101222142236.395|TR0|number of residents in every 
20101222142236.395|20101222142238.098|TR0|quadrant of the city and shifted 
20101222142238.098|20101222142239.800|TR0|the District's racial and ethnic 
20101222142239.800|20101222142241.503|TR0|mix. Whites and Hispanics have 
20101222142241.503|20101222142243.205|TR0|been moving in, while many 
20101222142243.205|20101222142244.907|TR0|African Americans have left and 
20101222142244.907|20101222142246.610|TR0|might be a minority before the 
20101222142246.610|20101222142248.312|TR0|next census is taken."

20101222142256.824|20101222142258.527|TR0|And talk about the significance

20101222142303.634|20101222142305.336|TR0|>> TIM STOREY: Well, Ohio is a 
20101222142305.336|20101222142307.039|TR0|state where the state 
20101222142307.039|20101222142308.741|TR0|legislature has the 
20101222142308.741|20101222142310.444|TR0|responsibility for drawing the 
20101222142310.444|20101222142312.146|TR0|new districts. Ohio, as a state, 
20101222142312.146|20101222142313.848|TR0|has been growing at a much 
20101222142313.848|20101222142315.551|TR0|slower rate than other states 
20101222142315.551|20101222142317.253|TR0|like Texas and Florida and 
20101222142317.253|20101222142318.956|TR0|Arizona and Nevada. So, Ohio is 
20101222142318.956|20101222142320.658|TR0|one of two states that's losing 
20101222142320.658|20101222142322.360|TR0|more than one seat in Congress, 
20101222142322.360|20101222142324.063|TR0|New York being the other one. 
20101222142324.063|20101222142325.765|TR0|And so, Ohio is losing two 
20101222142325.765|20101222142327.468|TR0|seats. And that means that 
20101222142327.468|20101222142329.170|TR0|because the legislature is now 
20101222142329.170|20101222142330.873|TR0|controlled by Republicans - as 
20101222142330.873|20101222142332.575|TR0|you mentioned at the beginning 
20101222142332.575|20101222142334.277|TR0|of the segment, the GOP had an 
20101222142334.277|20101222142335.980|TR0|extremely successful election at 
20101222142335.980|20101222142337.682|TR0|the state level in 2010. In 
20101222142337.682|20101222142339.385|TR0|fact, there are now more 
20101222142339.385|20101222142341.087|TR0|Republican state legislators 
20101222142341.087|20101222142342.789|TR0|than at any point since 1928. 
20101222142342.789|20101222142344.492|TR0|And this is on the heels of what 
20101222142344.492|20101222142346.194|TR0|had been some very strong 
20101222142346.194|20101222142347.897|TR0|Democratic successes in state 
20101222142347.897|20101222142349.599|TR0|legislatures. But 2010 was a 
20101222142349.599|20101222142351.302|TR0|pretty bad year for Democrats at 
20101222142351.302|20101222142353.004|TR0|the state legislative level, 
20101222142353.004|20101222142354.706|TR0|including in Ohio. So now 
20101222142354.706|20101222142356.409|TR0|Republican legislators and a new 
20101222142356.409|20101222142358.111|TR0|Republican governor in Ohio, 
20101222142358.111|20101222142359.814|TR0|John Kasich, will be ultimately 
20101222142359.814|20101222142401.516|TR0|responsible for drawing the new 
20101222142401.516|20101222142403.218|TR0|district lines for Congress in 
20101222142403.218|20101222142404.921|TR0|Ohio. So Democrats in Ohio, 
20101222142404.921|20101222142406.623|TR0|especially in places where the 
20101222142406.623|20101222142408.326|TR0|population is on the decline, 
20101222142408.326|20101222142410.028|TR0|like in Cleveland, are probably 
20101222142410.028|20101222142411.731|TR0|going to be sort of fighting for 
20101222142411.731|20101222142413.433|TR0|their political lives in the 
20101222142413.433|20101222142415.135|TR0|redistricting process.
20101222142415.135|20101222142416.838|TR0|
20101222142416.838|20101222142418.540|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Tim Storey, can 
20101222142418.540|20101222142420.243|TR0|you talk about how the Voting 
20101222142420.243|20101222142421.945|TR0|Rights Act affected 
20101222142421.945|20101222142423.647|TR0|redistricting and, in 
20101222142423.647|20101222142425.350|TR0|particular, where the states 
20101222142425.350|20101222142427.052|TR0|will - the Voting Rights Act 
20101222142427.052|20101222142428.755|TR0|will bear on how communities are 
20101222142428.755|20101222142430.457|TR0|restricted?
20101222142430.457|20101222142432.159|TR0|
20101222142432.159|20101222142433.862|TR0|>> TIM STOREY: Yes, Amy. The 
20101222142433.862|20101222142435.564|TR0|Voting Rights Act has a 
20101222142435.564|20101222142437.267|TR0|tremendous influence on how 
20101222142437.267|20101222142438.969|TR0|districts are drawn. Of course, 
20101222142438.969|20101222142440.672|TR0|it doesn't really affect the 
20101222142440.672|20101222142442.374|TR0|reapportionment, just the 
20101222142442.374|20101222142444.076|TR0|release of these numbers. But 
20101222142444.076|20101222142445.779|TR0|when the redistricting process 
20101222142445.779|20101222142447.481|TR0|begins in February and March, as 
20101222142447.481|20101222142449.184|TR0|I said, when that detailed data 
20101222142449.184|20101222142450.886|TR0|comes out that tells us the 
20101222142450.886|20101222142452.588|TR0|demographics of the country, the 
20101222142452.588|20101222142454.291|TR0|Voting Rights Act will have an 
20101222142454.291|20101222142455.993|TR0|extraordinarily important effect 
20101222142455.993|20101222142457.696|TR0|on how the districts are drawn. 
20101222142457.696|20101222142459.398|TR0|Of course, the Voting Rights Act 
20101222142459.398|20101222142501.101|TR0|was renewed since last census, 
20101222142501.101|20101222142502.803|TR0|since the last redistricting 
20101222142502.803|20101222142504.505|TR0|cycle, and continues to be a 
20101222142504.505|20101222142506.208|TR0|major part, one of the top-level 
20101222142506.208|20101222142507.910|TR0|criteria that - whether it's 
20101222142507.910|20101222142509.613|TR0|state legislators - there are a 
20101222142509.613|20101222142511.315|TR0|handful of states that have a 
20101222142511.315|20101222142513.017|TR0|commission that draws new 
20101222142513.017|20101222142514.720|TR0|districts. So, whoever is 
20101222142514.720|20101222142516.422|TR0|drawing those lines, they have 
20101222142516.422|20101222142518.125|TR0|to be especially aware of where 
20101222142518.125|20101222142519.827|TR0|minority populations are 
20101222142519.827|20101222142521.530|TR0|concentrated.
20101222142521.530|20101222142523.232|TR0|
20101222142523.232|20101222142524.934|TR0|In fact, what the act says is 
20101222142524.934|20101222142526.637|TR0|that if a minority group lives 
20101222142526.637|20101222142528.339|TR0|in a geographically compact 
20101222142528.339|20101222142530.042|TR0|area, they tend to vote as a 
20101222142530.042|20101222142531.744|TR0|group. And if white voters - the 
20101222142531.744|20101222142533.446|TR0|preference of white voters has 
20101222142533.446|20101222142535.149|TR0|traditionally defeated the 
20101222142535.149|20101222142536.851|TR0|candidate of choice for the 
20101222142536.851|20101222142538.554|TR0|minority community, then whoever 
20101222142538.554|20101222142540.256|TR0|draws those lines has to draw 
20101222142540.256|20101222142541.959|TR0|districts that gives them the 
20101222142541.959|20101222142543.661|TR0|opportunity to elect the 
20101222142543.661|20101222142545.363|TR0|candidate of their choice. This 
20101222142545.363|20101222142547.066|TR0|has resulted in a number of 
20101222142547.066|20101222142548.768|TR0|majority minority districts 
20101222142548.768|20101222142550.471|TR0|throughout the country, many of 
20101222142550.471|20101222142552.173|TR0|them in the South. And many of 
20101222142552.173|20101222142553.875|TR0|the members of Congressional 
20101222142553.875|20101222142555.578|TR0|Black Caucus, the Congressional 
20101222142555.578|20101222142557.280|TR0|Hispanic Caucus come from these 
20101222142557.280|20101222142558.983|TR0|districts. So the Voting Rights 
20101222142558.983|20101222142600.685|TR0|Act has a tremendous influence 
20101222142600.685|20101222142602.387|TR0|on the redistricting process.
20101222142602.387|20101222142604.090|TR0|
20101222142604.090|20101222142605.792|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And who draws 
20101222142605.792|20101222142607.495|TR0|those lines, Tim Storey?
20101222142607.495|20101222142609.197|TR0|
20101222142609.197|20101222142610.900|TR0|>> TIM STOREY: You know, the 
20101222142610.900|20101222142612.602|TR0|redistricting process and who 
20101222142612.602|20101222142614.304|TR0|actually conducts the plan 
20101222142614.304|20101222142616.007|TR0|development, the line drawing, 
20101222142616.007|20101222142617.709|TR0|varies from state to state. At 
20101222142617.709|20101222142619.412|TR0|the congressional level, the 
20101222142619.412|20101222142621.114|TR0|U.S. House district lines, there 
20101222142621.114|20101222142622.816|TR0|are seven states that have a 
20101222142622.816|20101222142624.519|TR0|board or a commission that draws 
20101222142624.519|20101222142626.221|TR0|the lines. The makeup of those 
20101222142626.221|20101222142627.924|TR0|commissions varies within those 
20101222142627.924|20101222142629.626|TR0|seven states. Some of them are 
20101222142629.626|20101222142631.329|TR0|probably more independent than 
20101222142631.329|20101222142633.031|TR0|others. But some of them are 
20101222142633.031|20101222142634.733|TR0|very partisan, some of those 
20101222142634.733|20101222142636.436|TR0|commissions.
20101222142636.436|20101222142638.138|TR0|
20101222142638.138|20101222142639.841|TR0|In the other 43 states, the 
20101222142639.841|20101222142641.543|TR0|legislature has the primary 
20101222142641.543|20101222142643.245|TR0|responsibility and authority to 
20101222142643.245|20101222142644.948|TR0|draw the new district lines. 
20101222142644.948|20101222142646.650|TR0|Now, one state, Iowa, has a very 
20101222142646.650|20101222142648.353|TR0|unique process, where they draw 
20101222142648.353|20101222142650.055|TR0|districts without any election 
20101222142650.055|20101222142651.758|TR0|data, any political data. But 
20101222142651.758|20101222142653.460|TR0|then the legislature votes on 
20101222142653.460|20101222142655.162|TR0|those plans. So Iowa is sort of 
20101222142655.162|20101222142656.865|TR0|in a category all its own. So 
20101222142656.865|20101222142658.567|TR0|you take them out, and in 42 
20101222142658.567|20101222142700.270|TR0|states it's the legislature, 
20101222142700.270|20101222142701.972|TR0|with the governor's approval in 
20101222142701.972|20101222142703.674|TR0|most cases. North Carolina and 
20101222142703.674|20101222142705.377|TR0|Connecticut are exceptions to 
20101222142705.377|20101222142707.079|TR0|that rule, where the 
20101222142707.079|20101222142708.782|TR0|legislature, without governor 
20101222142708.782|20101222142710.484|TR0|approval, will draw the lines 
20101222142710.484|20101222142712.187|TR0|for the U.S. House. But in most 
20101222142712.187|20101222142713.889|TR0|cases, it's the legislature that 
20101222142713.889|20101222142715.591|TR0|has the responsibility to draw 
20101222142715.591|20101222142717.294|TR0|the new districts, before the 
20101222142717.294|20101222142718.996|TR0|next election. Under the 
20101222142718.996|20101222142720.699|TR0|Constitution, we can't hold new 
20101222142720.699|20101222142722.401|TR0|elections in these 
20101222142722.401|20101222142724.103|TR0|population-based districts - 
20101222142724.103|20101222142725.806|TR0|U.S. House, state legislature - 
20101222142725.806|20101222142727.508|TR0|until we redraw the lines. So, 
20101222142727.508|20101222142729.211|TR0|all the new districts will 
20101222142729.211|20101222142730.913|TR0|essentially be unconstitutional

20101222142756.449|20101222142758.152|TR0|attacks, the Senate may be on 
20101222142758.152|20101222142759.854|TR0|the verge of finally voting on 
20101222142759.854|20101222142801.557|TR0|legislation that would grant

20101222142821.986|20101222142823.688|TR0|The House passed a $7.4 billion

20101222142832.200|20101222142833.902|TR0|Kristen Gillibrand announced a 
20101222142833.902|20101222142835.605|TR0|revised bill last week that 
20101222142835.605|20101222142837.307|TR0|reduced the cost to $6.2 billion 
20101222142837.307|20101222142839.010|TR0|over 10 years. They hope to have 
20101222142839.010|20101222142840.712|TR0|enough votes to bring the

20101222142847.522|20101222142849.224|TR0|Oklahoma has said he'll likely 
20101222142849.224|20101222142850.927|TR0|block the measure again. That's 
20101222142850.927|20101222142852.629|TR0|Dr. Coburn. Speaking on Fox News 
20101222142852.629|20101222142854.331|TR0|on Tuesday, he said the Senate 
20101222142854.331|20101222142856.034|TR0|needs time to consider the bill.

20101222142857.736|20101222142859.439|TR0|>> SEN. TOM COBURN: This bill 
20101222142859.439|20101222142901.141|TR0|hasn't even been through a 
20101222142901.141|20101222142902.843|TR0|committee. We haven't had the 
20101222142902.843|20101222142904.546|TR0|debate in our committee on this 
20101222142904.546|20101222142906.248|TR0|bill to know if it is the best 
20101222142906.248|20101222142907.951|TR0|thing to do. We haven't had the 
20101222142907.951|20101222142909.653|TR0|testimony to know whether. This 
20101222142909.653|20101222142911.356|TR0|is a bill that's been drawn up 
20101222142911.356|20101222142913.058|TR0|and forced through Congress at 
20101222142913.058|20101222142914.760|TR0|the end of the year on a basis 
20101222142914.760|20101222142916.463|TR0|to solve a problem that we 
20101222142916.463|20101222142918.165|TR0|didn't have time to solve and we 
20101222142918.165|20101222142919.868|TR0|didn't get done. So what we're 
20101222142919.868|20101222142921.570|TR0|going to do is we're going to 
20101222142921.570|20101222142923.272|TR0|pass a bill - maybe, doubtful - 
20101222142923.272|20101222142924.975|TR0|and then we're going to have to 
20101222142924.975|20101222142926.677|TR0|come back and fix it, and we're 
20101222142926.677|20101222142928.380|TR0|going to waste a whole bunch 
20101222142928.380|20101222142930.082|TR0|more money and not fix the real 
20101222142930.082|20101222142931.785|TR0|problem, which is taking care of 
20101222142931.785|20101222142933.487|TR0|those people who are so 
20101222142933.487|20101222142935.189|TR0|desperately dependent upon us. 
20101222142935.189|20101222142936.892|TR0|So, their hearts are in a good 
20101222142936.892|20101222142938.594|TR0|place, their heads not in a good 
20101222142938.594|20101222142940.297|TR0|place. We can do this next year, 
20101222142940.297|20101222142941.999|TR0|and we should.

20101222142945.404|20101222142947.106|TR0|Coburn, that's Senator Coburn 
20101222142947.106|20101222142948.809|TR0|from Oklahoma. He claims the 
20101222142948.809|20101222142950.511|TR0|bill was never considered by a 
20101222142950.511|20101222142952.214|TR0|congressional committee, but the 
20101222142952.214|20101222142953.916|TR0|Senate Health, Education, Labor 
20101222142953.916|20101222142955.618|TR0|and Pensions Committee did in 
20101222142955.618|20101222142957.321|TR0|fact hold a hearing on the bill 
20101222142957.321|20101222142959.023|TR0|in June. And Senator Coburn sits 
20101222142959.023|20101222143000.726|TR0|on that very committee.
20101222143000.726|20101222143002.428|TR0|
20101222143002.428|20101222143004.130|TR0|On Tuesday, 9/11 first 
20101222143004.130|20101222143005.833|TR0|responders headed to Washington, 
20101222143005.833|20101222143007.535|TR0|D.C. to call on the Senate to 
20101222143007.535|20101222143009.238|TR0|pass the bill. Speaking at a 
20101222143009.238|20101222143010.940|TR0|news conference with the Ground 
20101222143010.940|20101222143012.642|TR0|Zero workers, New York Senator 
20101222143012.642|20101222143014.345|TR0|Chuck Schumer urged his 
20101222143014.345|20101222143016.047|TR0|colleagues to vote on the 
20101222143016.047|20101222143017.750|TR0|measure.
20101222143017.750|20101222143019.452|TR0|
20101222143019.452|20101222143021.155|TR0|>> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: It is all 
20101222143021.155|20101222143022.857|TR0|too easy to say, "I'd like to 
20101222143022.857|20101222143024.559|TR0|dot the 'i' differently or cross 
20101222143024.559|20101222143026.262|TR0|the 't' differently, and let's 
20101222143026.262|20101222143027.964|TR0|start over.' But when you have 
20101222143027.964|20101222143029.667|TR0|cancer, you can't start over. 
20101222143029.667|20101222143031.369|TR0|And so, all these heroes are 
20101222143031.369|20101222143033.071|TR0|asking for is an up-or-down vote 
20101222143033.071|20101222143034.774|TR0|before Christmas. Waiting 'til 
20101222143034.774|20101222143036.476|TR0|next year would be a lump of 
20101222143036.476|20101222143038.179|TR0|coal, and we will not stand for 
20101222143038.179|20101222143039.881|TR0|it. Enough, enough, enough with 
20101222143039.881|20101222143041.584|TR0|the delays. These are American 
20101222143041.584|20101222143043.286|TR0|heroes. This is a matter of life 
20101222143043.286|20101222143044.988|TR0|and death. They didn't wait a 
20101222143044.988|20101222143046.691|TR0|minute before rushing to Ground 
20101222143046.691|20101222143048.393|TR0|Zero, but their government has 
20101222143048.393|20101222143050.096|TR0|been waiting nine years, and 
20101222143050.096|20101222143051.798|TR0|they cannot wait any longer.

20101222143053.500|20101222143055.203|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: If the bill 
20101222143055.203|20101222143056.905|TR0|passes in the Senate, it will 
20101222143056.905|20101222143058.608|TR0|have to go back to the House to 
20101222143058.608|20101222143100.310|TR0|get approval before the end of 
20101222143100.310|20101222143102.013|TR0|the session. House members will 
20101222143102.013|20101222143103.715|TR0|reportedly hang around the 
20101222143103.715|20101222143105.417|TR0|Capitol at least through the 
20101222143105.417|20101222143107.120|TR0|evening today to quickly sign 
20101222143107.120|20101222143108.822|TR0|off on any Senate-backed plan.

20101222143110.525|20101222143112.227|TR0|John Feal is with us today, 
20101222143112.227|20101222143113.929|TR0|former construction worker. He 
20101222143113.929|20101222143115.632|TR0|responded after the 9/11 
20101222143115.632|20101222143117.334|TR0|attacks, racing to Ground Zero 
20101222143117.334|20101222143119.037|TR0|to help out. Several days later, 
20101222143119.037|20101222143120.739|TR0|he lost his foot working there. 
20101222143120.739|20101222143122.442|TR0|He now suffers respiratory 
20101222143122.442|20101222143124.144|TR0|problems. He's a leading 
20101222143124.144|20101222143125.846|TR0|advocate for 9/11 responders and 
20101222143125.846|20101222143127.549|TR0|the president of the FealGood 
20101222143127.549|20101222143129.251|TR0|Foundation. He's part of the 
20101222143129.251|20101222143130.954|TR0|group of 9/11 first responders 
20101222143130.954|20101222143132.656|TR0|in D.C. right now to urge the 
20101222143132.656|20101222143134.358|TR0|Senate to pass the Zadroga bill. 
20101222143134.358|20101222143136.061|TR0|He's joining us from Washington, 
20101222143136.061|20101222143137.763|TR0|D.C.
20101222143137.763|20101222143139.466|TR0|
20101222143139.466|20101222143141.168|TR0|John Feal, what is your 
20101222143141.168|20101222143142.870|TR0|response, first, to Oklahoma 
20101222143142.870|20101222143144.573|TR0|Senator Tom Coburn, who himself 
20101222143144.573|20101222143146.275|TR0|is a doctor, who is blocking the 
20101222143146.275|20101222143147.978|TR0|bill?
20101222143147.978|20101222143149.680|TR0|
20101222143149.680|20101222143151.383|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: Well, Amy, one, 
20101222143151.383|20101222143153.085|TR0|thank you for having me.
20101222143153.085|20101222143154.787|TR0|
20101222143154.787|20101222143156.490|TR0|I was amazed by Dr. Coburn's 
20101222143156.490|20101222143158.192|TR0|response, because before he's a 
20101222143158.192|20101222143159.895|TR0|senator, he's a doctor. And I 
20101222143159.895|20101222143201.597|TR0|think he goes against his oath 
20101222143201.597|20101222143203.299|TR0|as a doctor to seriously 
20101222143203.299|20101222143205.002|TR0|consider helping people that 
20101222143205.002|20101222143206.704|TR0|have illnesses. And I'm not the 
20101222143206.704|20101222143208.407|TR0|smartest man in the world, but 
20101222143208.407|20101222143210.109|TR0|as a commonsense thinker, it 
20101222143210.109|20101222143211.812|TR0|just didn't - I couldn't digest 
20101222143211.812|20101222143213.514|TR0|it or wrap my arms around it 
20101222143213.514|20101222143215.216|TR0|that a doctor would be so 
20101222143215.216|20101222143216.919|TR0|against helping people that are 
20101222143216.919|20101222143218.621|TR0|seriously ill.
20101222143218.621|20101222143220.324|TR0|
20101222143220.324|20101222143222.026|TR0|And I just don't think the 
20101222143222.026|20101222143223.728|TR0|doctor has his facts straight, 
20101222143223.728|20101222143225.431|TR0|because there's been 22 
20101222143225.431|20101222143227.133|TR0|committee hearings in the House, 
20101222143227.133|20101222143228.836|TR0|and there's been one in the 
20101222143228.836|20101222143230.538|TR0|Senate. This bill is over nine 
20101222143230.538|20101222143232.241|TR0|years old. So, they can't hide 
20101222143232.241|20101222143233.943|TR0|behind excuses anymore, Amy. You 
20101222143233.943|20101222143235.645|TR0|know, they didn't like to pay 
20101222143235.645|20101222143237.348|TR0|for it, they didn't like this, 
20101222143237.348|20101222143239.050|TR0|they didn't like this. A couple 
20101222143239.050|20101222143240.753|TR0|years ago, the bill was $10.5 
20101222143240.753|20101222143242.455|TR0|billion. Now it's $6.2 billion. 
20101222143242.455|20101222143244.157|TR0|How much more can it go before 
20101222143244.157|20101222143245.860|TR0|you really can't help anybody 
20101222143245.860|20101222143247.562|TR0|anymore?
20101222143247.562|20101222143249.265|TR0|
20101222143249.265|20101222143250.967|TR0|But, Amy, I'm confident that the 
20101222143250.967|20101222143252.670|TR0|bill gets done today and passed, 
20101222143252.670|20101222143254.372|TR0|and it gets to the House and 
20101222143254.372|20101222143256.074|TR0|gets done in the House. And I'm 
20101222143256.074|20101222143257.777|TR0|not confident; I'm just - I've 
20101222143257.777|20101222143259.479|TR0|willed this to the finish line. 
20101222143259.479|20101222143301.182|TR0|And I'm going home on the bus 
20101222143301.182|20101222143302.884|TR0|today with some amazing people, 
20101222143302.884|20101222143304.586|TR0|and we're going to be smiling.
20101222143304.586|20101222143306.289|TR0|
20101222143306.289|20101222143307.991|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Explain what 
20101222143307.991|20101222143309.694|TR0|happened to you, John. 
20101222143309.694|20101222143311.396|TR0|Nine-eleven happened. The terror 
20101222143311.396|20101222143313.098|TR0|attacks took place. Where were 
20101222143313.098|20101222143314.801|TR0|you when it happened?
20101222143314.801|20101222143316.503|TR0|
20101222143316.503|20101222143318.206|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: Well, Amy, I got 
20101222143318.206|20101222143319.908|TR0|there the following night. So I 
20101222143319.908|20101222143321.611|TR0|was doing another large 
20101222143321.611|20101222143323.313|TR0|construction job upstate New 
20101222143323.313|20101222143325.015|TR0|York. So, I'm in no way a hero. 
20101222143325.015|20101222143326.718|TR0|In fact, I went to therapy for a 
20101222143326.718|20101222143328.420|TR0|year not to be called a hero. I 
20101222143328.420|20101222143330.123|TR0|wound up losing half of my foot. 
20101222143330.123|20101222143331.825|TR0|I spent 11 weeks in the hospital 
20101222143331.825|20101222143333.527|TR0|with gangrene after 8,000 pounds 
20101222143333.527|20101222143335.230|TR0|of steel crushed my foot on 
20101222143335.230|20101222143336.932|TR0|September 17th. But my injury 
20101222143336.932|20101222143338.635|TR0|pales in comparison to these 
20101222143338.635|20101222143340.337|TR0|illnesses that these men and 
20101222143340.337|20101222143342.040|TR0|women suffer. My injury is 
20101222143342.040|20101222143343.742|TR0|gruesome and horrific to look 
20101222143343.742|20101222143345.444|TR0|at, but these invisible 
20101222143345.444|20101222143347.147|TR0|diseases, like these cancers and 
20101222143347.147|20101222143348.849|TR0|these severe respiratory 
20101222143348.849|20101222143350.552|TR0|problems and sarcoidosis, 
20101222143350.552|20101222143352.254|TR0|pulmonary fibrosis, and the 
20101222143352.254|20101222143353.956|TR0|post-traumatic, which is killing 
20101222143353.956|20101222143355.659|TR0|these people left and right, is 
20101222143355.659|20101222143357.361|TR0|invisible, and you can't see it. 
20101222143357.361|20101222143359.064|TR0|And we have lost 990 people 
20101222143359.064|20101222143400.766|TR0|since 9/11 to 9/11-related 
20101222143400.766|20101222143402.469|TR0|illnesses. And if that's not 
20101222143402.469|20101222143404.171|TR0|enough fact to pass this bill, 
20101222143404.171|20101222143405.873|TR0|then I'm dumbfounded by what it 
20101222143405.873|20101222143407.576|TR0|actually takes to get something 
20101222143407.576|20101222143409.278|TR0|done in D.C.
20101222143409.278|20101222143410.981|TR0|
20101222143410.981|20101222143412.683|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I want to turn 
20101222143412.683|20101222143414.385|TR0|to an interview that I did with 
20101222143414.385|20101222143416.088|TR0|a sick 9/11 worker, Joe Picurro. 
20101222143416.088|20101222143417.790|TR0|He was an ironworker from New 
20101222143417.790|20101222143419.493|TR0|Jersey. He was 34 years old when 
20101222143419.493|20101222143421.195|TR0|he went to Ground Zero after 
20101222143421.195|20101222143422.898|TR0|9/11. He died in October from 
20101222143422.898|20101222143424.600|TR0|his illnesses. I spoke to Joe by 
20101222143424.600|20101222143426.302|TR0|telephone, September 11, 2009. 
20101222143426.302|20101222143428.005|TR0|This is some of what he had to 
20101222143428.005|20101222143429.707|TR0|say.
20101222143429.707|20101222143431.410|TR0|
20101222143431.410|20101222143433.112|TR0|>> JOE PICURRO: You know, like 
20101222143433.112|20101222143434.814|TR0|my doctor said, I have the lungs 
20101222143434.814|20101222143436.517|TR0|of a 95-year-old man. Now, you 
20101222143436.517|20101222143438.219|TR0|know, what she said about age, 
20101222143438.219|20101222143439.922|TR0|you know, we're aging and our 
20101222143439.922|20101222143441.624|TR0|bodies are aging way before 
20101222143441.624|20101222143443.326|TR0|they're supposed to. You know, 
20101222143443.326|20101222143445.029|TR0|and like I said, the doctor gave 
20101222143445.029|20101222143446.731|TR0|me a year or so to live, you 
20101222143446.731|20101222143448.434|TR0|know, and a year or two to live.
20101222143448.434|20101222143450.136|TR0|
20101222143450.136|20101222143451.839|TR0|And, you know, that's - you 
20101222143451.839|20101222143453.541|TR0|know, we need to get this 
20101222143453.541|20101222143455.243|TR0|straight. We need to straighten 
20101222143455.243|20101222143456.946|TR0|this out. We need to get the 
20101222143456.946|20101222143458.648|TR0|funding. We need to get the 
20101222143458.648|20101222143500.351|TR0|James Zadroga bill passed. You 
20101222143500.351|20101222143502.053|TR0|know, I mean, I've been saying 
20101222143502.053|20101222143503.755|TR0|this year after year - so has 
20101222143503.755|20101222143505.458|TR0|Ms. Maloney and also Ms. Moline 
20101222143505.458|20101222143507.160|TR0|- that it has to be passed. And 
20101222143507.160|20101222143508.863|TR0|yet, it never seems to make it. 
20101222143508.863|20101222143510.565|TR0|It never seems to get passed. 
20101222143510.565|20101222143512.268|TR0|And I don't understand why.
20101222143512.268|20101222143513.970|TR0|
20101222143513.970|20101222143515.672|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was Joe 
20101222143515.672|20101222143517.375|TR0|Picurro. He died this past 
20101222143517.375|20101222143519.077|TR0|October. John -

20101222143524.184|20101222143525.887|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Yes, did you 
20101222143525.887|20101222143527.589|TR0|know Joe?
20101222143527.589|20101222143529.292|TR0|
20101222143529.292|20101222143530.994|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: I was at Joe's - 
20101222143530.994|20101222143532.697|TR0|Joe was one of my - when I 
20101222143532.697|20101222143534.399|TR0|started the foundation, Joe was 
20101222143534.399|20101222143536.101|TR0|one of my first clients. And I 
20101222143536.101|20101222143537.804|TR0|hate to use the word "client," 
20101222143537.804|20101222143539.506|TR0|because Joe was a hero. And Joe 
20101222143539.506|20101222143541.209|TR0|was one of the first people I 
20101222143541.209|20101222143542.911|TR0|financially donated to. I went 
20101222143542.911|20101222143544.613|TR0|to Joe's funeral. And Joe was - 
20101222143544.613|20101222143546.316|TR0|I've been to 44 funerals in the 
20101222143546.316|20101222143548.018|TR0|last four-and-a-half years, and 
20101222143548.018|20101222143549.721|TR0|Joe was number 43. And just a 
20101222143549.721|20101222143551.423|TR0|couple weeks ago in New Jersey, 
20101222143551.423|20101222143553.125|TR0|we did an event for Laura, where 
20101222143553.125|20101222143554.828|TR0|I put a bucket in the middle of 
20101222143554.828|20101222143556.530|TR0|a gymnasium and I took advantage 
20101222143556.530|20101222143558.233|TR0|of the people there and I raised 
20101222143558.233|20101222143559.935|TR0|about $1,800 in about three 
20101222143559.935|20101222143601.638|TR0|minutes, just because I took a 
20101222143601.638|20101222143603.340|TR0|white bucket out. And I gave it 
20101222143603.340|20101222143605.042|TR0|to Laura Picurro, because as 
20101222143605.042|20101222143606.745|TR0|soon as Joe died, Laura's 
20101222143606.745|20101222143608.447|TR0|benefits were cut off.

20101222143615.257|20101222143616.959|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: Save lives. The 
20101222143616.959|20101222143618.662|TR0|bill is half healthcare, and 
20101222143618.662|20101222143620.364|TR0|it's half compensation. And the 
20101222143620.364|20101222143622.067|TR0|centers of excellence that treat 
20101222143622.067|20101222143623.769|TR0|us would remain open for so many

20101222143625.471|20101222143627.174|TR0|so that it cannot only collect 
20101222143627.174|20101222143628.876|TR0|data and monitor us, but use 
20101222143628.876|20101222143630.579|TR0|preventive medicine. What a 
20101222143630.579|20101222143632.281|TR0|concept. And they could do 
20101222143632.281|20101222143633.983|TR0|scientific research for the 
20101222143633.983|20101222143635.686|TR0|illnesses that are coming out 
20101222143635.686|20101222143637.388|TR0|now. Then the other half of the

20101222143639.091|20101222143640.793|TR0|risked their lives without 
20101222143640.793|20101222143642.496|TR0|prejudice would be compensated 
20101222143642.496|20101222143644.198|TR0|for the financial burden on not 
20101222143644.198|20101222143645.900|TR0|having any work over the last 
20101222143645.900|20101222143647.603|TR0|nine years because of their 
20101222143647.603|20101222143649.305|TR0|illnesses. They can't even 
20101222143649.305|20101222143651.008|TR0|afford to put gas in their car 
20101222143651.008|20101222143652.710|TR0|to get to the doctor or go to 
20101222143652.710|20101222143654.412|TR0|their chemotherapy appointment. 
20101222143654.412|20101222143656.115|TR0|They can't put food on the

20101222143657.817|20101222143659.520|TR0|thinks 9/11 happened and it's 
20101222143659.520|20101222143701.222|TR0|over, but 9/11 and its

20101222143702.925|20101222143704.627|TR0|through their families - you

20101222143706.329|20101222143708.032|TR0|people are getting divorced, 
20101222143708.032|20101222143709.734|TR0|kids are in therapy. I mean, 
20101222143709.734|20101222143711.437|TR0|this is just cruel and unusual 
20101222143711.437|20101222143713.139|TR0|punishment.

20101222143738.675|20101222143740.378|TR0|personally. You gave your kidney 
20101222143740.378|20101222143742.080|TR0|to who?
20101222143742.080|20101222143743.782|TR0|
20101222143743.782|20101222143745.485|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: It was a 
20101222143745.485|20101222143747.187|TR0|no-brainer. I get about two or 
20101222143747.187|20101222143748.890|TR0|three hundred emails a day on 
20101222143748.890|20101222143750.592|TR0|average. And somebody emailed me 
20101222143750.592|20101222143752.295|TR0|back in 2006 and said, "I think 
20101222143752.295|20101222143753.997|TR0|what you're doing to help people 
20101222143753.997|20101222143755.699|TR0|is great. Can you link me to 
20101222143755.699|20101222143757.402|TR0|your website, because I need a 
20101222143757.402|20101222143759.104|TR0|kidney?" And he was responder. 
20101222143759.104|20101222143800.807|TR0|And I said, "No, you could just 
20101222143800.807|20101222143802.509|TR0|have mine." And he's like - he 
20101222143802.509|20101222143804.211|TR0|used a bunch of curse words, 
20101222143804.211|20101222143805.914|TR0|saying, "Don't fool around and 
20101222143805.914|20101222143807.616|TR0|kid like that." And I still got 
20101222143807.616|20101222143809.319|TR0|the email on - taped to my 
20101222143809.319|20101222143811.021|TR0|refrigerator. And a couple weeks 
20101222143811.021|20101222143812.724|TR0|later, we went and got tested. 
20101222143812.724|20101222143814.426|TR0|And I wasn't a hundred percent 
20101222143814.426|20101222143816.128|TR0|match, but I could have gave it 
20101222143816.128|20101222143817.831|TR0|to him, but there was a chance 
20101222143817.831|20101222143819.533|TR0|of rejection. So the hospital 
20101222143819.533|20101222143821.236|TR0|said, "Well, why don't you give 
20101222143821.236|20101222143822.938|TR0|it to somebody? We'll make sure 
20101222143822.938|20101222143824.640|TR0|he gets a better one." We wound 
20101222143824.640|20101222143826.343|TR0|up doing a six-person swap. So, 
20101222143826.343|20101222143828.045|TR0|in essence, I got to help three 
20101222143828.045|20101222143829.748|TR0|people. And listen, I've never 
20101222143829.748|20101222143831.450|TR0|won Lotto, but that was the best 
20101222143831.450|20101222143833.153|TR0|feeling in the world.
20101222143833.153|20101222143834.855|TR0|

20101222143836.557|20101222143838.260|TR0|remarkable, John.

20101222143839.962|20101222143841.665|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: And August 30, 
20101222143841.665|20101222143843.367|TR0|2007 - no, I'm just an average 
20101222143843.367|20101222143845.069|TR0|guy who believes that you've got 
20101222143845.069|20101222143846.772|TR0|to help people less fortunate. 
20101222143846.772|20101222143848.474|TR0|You know, as Americans, we have 
20101222143848.474|20101222143850.177|TR0|extra money, we have extra food, 
20101222143850.177|20101222143851.879|TR0|and basically we have extra body 
20101222143851.879|20101222143853.581|TR0|parts. And if - I don't know 
20101222143853.581|20101222143855.284|TR0|what happened after 9/11, 
20101222143855.284|20101222143856.986|TR0|because everybody was so united. 
20101222143856.986|20101222143858.689|TR0|This country came together, and 
20101222143858.689|20101222143900.391|TR0|you could smell, not only feel, 
20101222143900.391|20101222143902.094|TR0|the love and patriotism in the 
20101222143902.094|20101222143903.796|TR0|air. Somewhere along the line, 
20101222143903.796|20101222143905.498|TR0|this country lost that loving 
20101222143905.498|20101222143907.201|TR0|feeling. And I think it's 
20101222143907.201|20101222143908.903|TR0|because of poor politics and 
20101222143908.903|20101222143910.606|TR0|leadership and reckless politics 
20101222143910.606|20101222143912.308|TR0|that this country is going in 
20101222143912.308|20101222143914.010|TR0|the wrong direction. And this 
20101222143914.010|20101222143915.713|TR0|great nation, the tenacity and 
20101222143915.713|20101222143917.415|TR0|the resolve and the testament 
20101222143917.415|20101222143919.118|TR0|after the worst horrific attack 
20101222143919.118|20101222143920.820|TR0|ever, came together, and I'd 
20101222143920.820|20101222143922.523|TR0|like to see that happen again. 
20101222143922.523|20101222143924.225|TR0|And it's up to the White House 
20101222143924.225|20101222143925.927|TR0|and the Senate and the Congress 
20101222143925.927|20101222143927.630|TR0|to start behaving themselves and 
20101222143927.630|20101222143929.332|TR0|doing what's right by the 
20101222143929.332|20101222143931.035|TR0|American people, so the American 
20101222143931.035|20101222143932.737|TR0|people can once again get on 
20101222143932.737|20101222143934.439|TR0|track with their lives and start 
20101222143934.439|20101222143936.142|TR0|helping each other.

20101222143941.249|20101222143942.952|TR0|August, and it was around the

20101222143944.654|20101222143946.356|TR0|Ground Zero area -

20101222143954.868|20101222143956.571|TR0|
20101222143956.571|20101222143958.273|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: Well, I've written 
20101222143958.273|20101222143959.976|TR0|a few letters to Barack Obama, 
20101222143959.976|20101222144001.678|TR0|and I feel like I know him 
20101222144001.678|20101222144003.381|TR0|without ever meeting him. 
20101222144003.381|20101222144005.083|TR0|Listen, I voted for the man, and 
20101222144005.083|20101222144006.785|TR0|I believe in his politics. But 
20101222144006.785|20101222144008.488|TR0|when you come out and you speak 
20101222144008.488|20101222144010.190|TR0|about a mosque, which, if you 
20101222144010.190|20101222144011.893|TR0|ask the 9/11 responder 
20101222144011.893|20101222144013.595|TR0|community, it's not that 
20101222144013.595|20101222144015.297|TR0|important to us - what's 
20101222144015.297|20101222144017.000|TR0|important to us is this bill. 
20101222144017.000|20101222144018.702|TR0|This bill saves lives. And, you 
20101222144018.702|20101222144020.405|TR0|know, I want to talk about this 
20101222144020.405|20101222144022.107|TR0|bill, because this bill is paid 
20101222144022.107|20101222144023.809|TR0|for. It doesn't add to the 
20101222144023.809|20101222144025.512|TR0|deficit. It doesn't add taxes to 
20101222144025.512|20101222144027.214|TR0|the American people. In fact, 
20101222144027.214|20101222144028.917|TR0|the new paid for helps the 
20101222144028.917|20101222144030.619|TR0|deficit, it lowers it. Now, 
20101222144030.619|20101222144032.322|TR0|we're in two wars because of 
20101222144032.322|20101222144034.024|TR0|9/11. Those wars are not paid 
20101222144034.024|20101222144035.726|TR0|for. The Bush tax cuts are not 
20101222144035.726|20101222144037.429|TR0|paid for. Every bill that's gone 
20101222144037.429|20101222144039.131|TR0|before us and everything that's 
20101222144039.131|20101222144040.834|TR0|gone before us over the last few 
20101222144040.834|20101222144042.536|TR0|years is not paid for. We have a 
20101222144042.536|20101222144044.238|TR0|bill that's paid for, and yet 
20101222144044.238|20101222144045.941|TR0|everybody still hides behind 
20101222144045.941|20101222144047.643|TR0|their ideologies.
20101222144047.643|20101222144049.346|TR0|
20101222144049.346|20101222144051.048|TR0|People need to start acting like 
20101222144051.048|20101222144052.751|TR0|Americans and man up on their 
20101222144052.751|20101222144054.453|TR0|patriotism, because men and 
20101222144054.453|20101222144056.155|TR0|women are sick and dying. And 
20101222144056.155|20101222144057.858|TR0|wow, my mother raised me to help 
20101222144057.858|20101222144059.560|TR0|those less fortunate. I didn't 
20101222144059.560|20101222144101.263|TR0|need 9/11 to know right from 
20101222144101.263|20101222144102.965|TR0|wrong. I needed everybody to 
20101222144102.965|20101222144104.667|TR0|show how my mother raised me. 
20101222144104.667|20101222144106.370|TR0|And, Amy, I hope I'm wrong, but 
20101222144106.370|20101222144108.072|TR0|I truly hope that they prove me 
20101222144108.072|20101222144109.775|TR0|wrong today and vote yes on this 
20101222144109.775|20101222144111.477|TR0|bill. And I'm confident that 
20101222144111.477|20101222144113.180|TR0|this bill goes on the floor 
20101222144113.180|20101222144114.882|TR0|today, and I'm confident that we 
20101222144114.882|20101222144116.584|TR0|get it done today. I have never 
20101222144116.584|20101222144118.287|TR0|wavered once. I said it would 
20101222144118.287|20101222144119.989|TR0|get done by the end of the year, 
20101222144119.989|20101222144121.692|TR0|and we're going to get it done.

20101222144135.311|20101222144137.013|TR0|brought down the cost of the 
20101222144137.013|20101222144138.716|TR0|bill from $7.4, which is what 
20101222144138.716|20101222144140.418|TR0|the House voted on in September -
20101222144140.418|20101222144142.121|TR0|
20101222144142.121|20101222144143.823|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: Sure.

20101222144147.228|20101222144148.930|TR0|it, $6.2 billion. What have you 
20101222144148.930|20101222144150.633|TR0|lost there?
20101222144150.633|20101222144152.335|TR0|
20101222144152.335|20101222144154.037|TR0|>> JOHN FEAL: Correct. Well, 
20101222144154.037|20101222144155.740|TR0|really, nothing. You don't 
20101222144155.740|20101222144157.442|TR0|really lose anything, because 
20101222144157.442|20101222144159.145|TR0|once the bill passes and the 
20101222144159.145|20101222144200.847|TR0|programs are up and running, 
20101222144200.847|20101222144202.550|TR0|they run out of money, they go 
20101222144202.550|20101222144204.252|TR0|back and get more. And again, if 
20101222144204.252|20101222144205.954|TR0|that's the concession - listen, 
20101222144205.954|20101222144207.657|TR0|even if it was $5 billion, it's 
20101222144207.657|20101222144209.359|TR0|still a bill and it's still a 
20101222144209.359|20101222144211.062|TR0|program up and running. That 's 
20101222144211.062|20101222144212.764|TR0|what's more important. The 
20101222144212.764|20101222144214.466|TR0|centers of excellence need to 
20101222144214.466|20101222144216.169|TR0|stay open and need to be fluid, 
20101222144216.169|20101222144217.871|TR0|and they need to get the VCF 
20101222144217.871|20101222144219.574|TR0|with a special master in place. 
20101222144219.574|20101222144221.276|TR0|So, whether it's $7 million or 
20101222144221.276|20101222144222.979|TR0|$5 billion or $6 billion, I'm OK 
20101222144222.979|20101222144224.681|TR0|with that, because at the end of 
20101222144224.681|20101222144226.383|TR0|the day, while the bill is no 
20101222144226.383|20101222144228.086|TR0|longer a 10 - I give it a seven 
20101222144228.086|20101222144229.788|TR0|- a seven is better than a zero. 
20101222144229.788|20101222144231.491|TR0|And a seven saves lives. And 
20101222144231.491|20101222144233.193|TR0|Senator Gillibrand and Schumer 
20101222144233.193|20101222144234.895|TR0|have been our champions. But 
20101222144234.895|20101222144236.598|TR0|more importantly, never test the 
20101222144236.598|20101222144238.300|TR0|- never mistake the resolve and 
20101222144238.300|20101222144240.003|TR0|the character of the 9/11 
20101222144240.003|20101222144241.705|TR0|community, because it's because 
20101222144241.705|20101222144243.408|TR0|to them this bill is where it is 
20101222144243.408|20101222144245.110|TR0|today.

20101222144312.349|20101222144314.051|TR0|We spoke to his staff. And they 
20101222144314.051|20101222144315.753|TR0|told us his stance. We told them 
20101222144315.753|20101222144317.456|TR0|our stance. And listen, Amy, it 
20101222144317.456|20101222144319.158|TR0|was my 89th trip to D.C. over 
20101222144319.158|20101222144320.861|TR0|the last five years, and I 
20101222144320.861|20101222144322.563|TR0|document and mark everything. 
20101222144322.563|20101222144324.265|TR0|So, I've met with these senators

20101222144325.968|20101222144327.670|TR0|and their legislative aides. I 
20101222144327.670|20101222144329.373|TR0|think Dr. Coburn and Republican 
20101222144329.373|20101222144331.075|TR0|leadership is going to have a 
20101222144331.075|20101222144332.778|TR0|moment of clarity today, and I'm

20101222144406.826|20101222144408.528|TR0|at home base has helped. And, 
20101222144408.528|20101222144410.231|TR0|you know, let's call it like it 
20101222144410.231|20101222144411.933|TR0|is. Jon Stewart started a media 
20101222144411.933|20101222144413.636|TR0|tidal wave, and it took a 
20101222144413.636|20101222144415.338|TR0|comedian to get the national 
20101222144415.338|20101222144417.040|TR0|news to show everybody who the 
20101222144417.040|20101222144418.743|TR0|real comedian was. And I believe 
20101222144418.743|20101222144420.445|TR0|that was in D.C. So, you know, 
20101222144420.445|20101222144422.148|TR0|who's laughing now? I mean, it 
20101222144422.148|20101222144423.850|TR0|took Jon Stewart from The Daily 
20101222144423.850|20101222144425.552|TR0|Show to do all of this. And I 
20101222144425.552|20101222144427.255|TR0|spoke to Mr. Stewart the day 
20101222144427.255|20101222144428.957|TR0|before the show, and I was in 
20101222144428.957|20101222144430.660|TR0|D.C. the day of the show, 
20101222144430.660|20101222144432.362|TR0|because I was here lobbying 
20101222144432.362|20101222144434.064|TR0|again. And I had the chance to 
20101222144434.064|20101222144435.767|TR0|go on his show, and I said, "Mr. 
20101222144435.767|20101222144437.469|TR0|Stewart, you're on my bucket 
20101222144437.469|20101222144439.172|TR0|list of things to do, but I've

20101222144440.874|20101222144442.577|TR0|And so, they put the four guys

20101222144542.161|20101222144543.864|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Mississippi 
20101222144543.864|20101222144545.566|TR0|Governor Haley Barbour is facing 
20101222144545.566|20101222144547.268|TR0|growing national controversy for 
20101222144547.268|20101222144548.971|TR0|praising the role of the White 
20101222144548.971|20101222144550.673|TR0|Citizens' Councils, which 
20101222144550.673|20101222144552.376|TR0|opposed racial integration in 
20101222144552.376|20101222144554.078|TR0|the '50s and '60s. In addition, 
20101222144554.078|20101222144555.780|TR0|Barbour recalled the civil 
20101222144555.780|20101222144557.483|TR0|rights struggle in his hometown, 
20101222144557.483|20101222144559.185|TR0|Yazoo City, Mississippi, saying, 
20101222144559.185|20101222144600.888|TR0|quote, "I just don't remember it 
20101222144600.888|20101222144602.590|TR0|as being that bad." Speaking to 
20101222144602.590|20101222144604.292|TR0|the Weekly Standard, Barbour 
20101222144604.292|20101222144605.995|TR0|described the White Citizens' 
20101222144605.995|20101222144607.697|TR0|Councils as an "organization of 
20101222144607.697|20101222144609.400|TR0|town leaders," but historians in 
20101222144609.400|20101222144611.102|TR0|Mississippi say the White 
20101222144611.102|20101222144612.805|TR0|Citizens' Councils played an 
20101222144612.805|20101222144614.507|TR0|active role in trying to keep 
20101222144614.507|20101222144616.209|TR0|public schools segregated.
20101222144616.209|20101222144617.912|TR0|
20101222144617.912|20101222144619.614|TR0|Following the 1955 Supreme Court 
20101222144619.614|20101222144621.317|TR0|ruling in Brown v. Board of 
20101222144621.317|20101222144623.019|TR0|Education, a group of 53 black 
20101222144623.019|20101222144624.721|TR0|parents in Yazoo City signed a 
20101222144624.721|20101222144626.424|TR0|petition to desegregate public 
20101222144626.424|20101222144628.126|TR0|schools. According to the 
20101222144628.126|20101222144629.829|TR0|Jackson Clarion-Ledger, the 
20101222144629.829|20101222144631.531|TR0|White Citizens' Councils 
20101222144631.531|20101222144633.234|TR0|responded by taking out an 
20101222144633.234|20101222144634.936|TR0|advertisement in the local 
20101222144634.936|20101222144636.638|TR0|newspaper listing the parents' 
20101222144636.638|20101222144638.341|TR0|name. The names also appeared on 
20101222144638.341|20101222144640.043|TR0|placards around town and in 
20101222144640.043|20101222144641.746|TR0|cotton fields. Most of those who 
20101222144641.746|20101222144643.448|TR0|had signed the petition were 
20101222144643.448|20101222144645.150|TR0|forced to leave the city because 
20101222144645.150|20101222144646.853|TR0|they lost their jobs and 
20101222144646.853|20101222144648.555|TR0|couldn't find other work.
20101222144648.555|20101222144650.258|TR0|
20101222144650.258|20101222144651.960|TR0|Governor Barbour has been widely 
20101222144651.960|20101222144653.663|TR0|viewed as a possible Republican 
20101222144653.663|20101222144655.365|TR0|presidential candidate in 2012, 
20101222144655.365|20101222144657.067|TR0|but this controversy could 
20101222144657.067|20101222144658.770|TR0|derail his prospects. On 
20101222144658.770|20101222144700.472|TR0|Tuesday, he tried to contain the 
20101222144700.472|20101222144702.175|TR0|controversy, releasing a 
20101222144702.175|20101222144703.877|TR0|statement backing off his praise 
20101222144703.877|20101222144705.579|TR0|of the Councils. Barbour said, 
20101222144705.579|20101222144707.282|TR0|quote, "When asked why my 
20101222144707.282|20101222144708.984|TR0|hometown in Mississippi did not 
20101222144708.984|20101222144710.687|TR0|suffer the same racial violence 
20101222144710.687|20101222144712.389|TR0|when I was a young man that 
20101222144712.389|20101222144714.091|TR0|accompanied other towns' 
20101222144714.091|20101222144715.794|TR0|integration efforts, I 
20101222144715.794|20101222144717.496|TR0|accurately said the community 
20101222144717.496|20101222144719.199|TR0|leadership wouldn't tolerate it 
20101222144719.199|20101222144720.901|TR0|and helped prevent violence 
20101222144720.901|20101222144722.604|TR0|there. My point was my town 
20101222144722.604|20101222144724.306|TR0|rejected the Ku Klux Klan, but 
20101222144724.306|20101222144726.008|TR0|nobody should construe that to 
20101222144726.008|20101222144727.711|TR0|mean I think the town leadership 
20101222144727.711|20101222144729.413|TR0|were saints, either. Their 
20101222144729.413|20101222144731.116|TR0|vehicle, called the 'Citizens 
20101222144731.116|20101222144732.818|TR0|Council,' is totally 
20101222144732.818|20101222144734.520|TR0|indefensible, as is segregation. 
20101222144734.520|20101222144736.223|TR0|It was a difficult and painful 
20101222144736.223|20101222144737.925|TR0|era for Mississippi, the rest of 
20101222144737.925|20101222144739.628|TR0|the country, and especially 
20101222144739.628|20101222144741.330|TR0|African Americans who were 
20101222144741.330|20101222144743.033|TR0|persecuted in that time," Haley 
20101222144743.033|20101222144744.735|TR0|Barbour said.
20101222144744.735|20101222144746.437|TR0|
20101222144746.437|20101222144748.140|TR0|Well, for more on the 
20101222144748.140|20101222144749.842|TR0|controversy over Barbour's 
20101222144749.842|20101222144751.545|TR0|praise of the White Citizens' 
20101222144751.545|20101222144753.247|TR0|Councils, we go to Indiana. 
20101222144753.247|20101222144754.949|TR0|We're joined by John Dittmer, 
20101222144754.949|20101222144756.652|TR0|Professor Emeritus of History at 
20101222144756.652|20101222144758.354|TR0|DePauw University, author of the

20101222144800.057|20101222144801.759|TR0|for Civil Rights in Mississippi. 
20101222144801.759|20101222144803.462|TR0|John Dittmer is joining us from 
20101222144803.462|20101222144805.164|TR0|Indianapolis.
20101222144805.164|20101222144806.866|TR0|
20101222144806.866|20101222144808.569|TR0|Can you comment on what Governor 
20101222144808.569|20101222144810.271|TR0|Barbour said?
20101222144810.271|20101222144811.974|TR0|
20101222144811.974|20101222144813.676|TR0|>> JOHN DITTMER: Well, I think 
20101222144813.676|20101222144815.378|TR0|that just the idea of stating 
20101222144815.378|20101222144817.081|TR0|that the Citizens' Council had a 
20101222144817.081|20101222144818.783|TR0|positive effect on the 
20101222144818.783|20101222144820.486|TR0|desegregation of schools in 
20101222144820.486|20101222144822.188|TR0|Yazoo City is absolutely absurd. 
20101222144822.188|20101222144823.891|TR0|The Governor is standing 
20101222144823.891|20101222144825.593|TR0|Mississippi history on its head, 
20101222144825.593|20101222144827.295|TR0|because the Citizens' Council 
20101222144827.295|20101222144828.998|TR0|was formed specifically to 
20101222144828.998|20101222144830.700|TR0|prevent the integration of 
20101222144830.700|20101222144832.403|TR0|schools.
20101222144832.403|20101222144834.105|TR0|
20101222144834.105|20101222144835.807|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And talk about 
20101222144835.807|20101222144837.510|TR0|his other comment, saying he 
20101222144837.510|20101222144839.212|TR0|didn't think it was that bad 
20101222144839.212|20101222144840.915|TR0|there when he was growing up in 
20101222144840.915|20101222144842.617|TR0|Yazoo City.
20101222144842.617|20101222144844.319|TR0|
20101222144844.319|20101222144846.022|TR0|>> JOHN DITTMER: Well, I think 
20101222144846.022|20101222144847.724|TR0|that's a very important point, 
20101222144847.724|20101222144849.427|TR0|and I think that we should look 
20101222144849.427|20101222144851.129|TR0|at what the racial situation 
20101222144851.129|20101222144852.832|TR0|really was at that time when 
20101222144852.832|20101222144854.534|TR0|Haley Barbour was growing up. If 
20101222144854.534|20101222144856.236|TR0|you look at several indices, for 
20101222144856.236|20101222144857.939|TR0|example, most blacks in 
20101222144857.939|20101222144859.641|TR0|Mississippi were doing the same 
20101222144859.641|20101222144901.344|TR0|kinds of jobs in the '50s that 
20101222144901.344|20101222144903.046|TR0|they were doing during slavery - 
20101222144903.046|20101222144904.748|TR0|that is, working on plantations 
20101222144904.748|20101222144906.451|TR0|or being maids in a white 
20101222144906.451|20101222144908.153|TR0|women's houses. You had six 
20101222144908.153|20101222144909.856|TR0|percent of the black electorate 
20101222144909.856|20101222144911.558|TR0|were - eligible black 
20101222144911.558|20101222144913.261|TR0|electorate, were registered. And 
20101222144913.261|20101222144914.963|TR0|in terms of education as a way 
20101222144914.963|20101222144916.665|TR0|up, over 70 percent of black 
20101222144916.665|20101222144918.368|TR0|adults had gone no further than 
20101222144918.368|20101222144920.070|TR0|the seventh grade. Black schools 
20101222144920.070|20101222144921.773|TR0|were inferior in every way. 
20101222144921.773|20101222144923.475|TR0|Whites were spending four times 
20101222144923.475|20101222144925.177|TR0|as much money - the government 
20101222144925.177|20101222144926.880|TR0|was spending four times as much 
20101222144926.880|20101222144928.582|TR0|money on white schools as on 
20101222144928.582|20101222144930.285|TR0|blacks, which of course led to 
20101222144930.285|20101222144931.987|TR0|this - to the Brown decision.
20101222144931.987|20101222144933.690|TR0|
20101222144933.690|20101222144935.392|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Talk about this 
20101222144935.392|20101222144937.094|TR0|issue of what I just raised, the 
20101222144937.094|20101222144938.797|TR0|White Citizens' Councils 
20101222144938.797|20101222144940.499|TR0|responding to an advertisement 
20101222144940.499|20101222144942.202|TR0|that was signed off on by a 
20101222144942.202|20101222144943.904|TR0|number of African American 
20101222144943.904|20101222144945.606|TR0|families. Explain what happened.
20101222144945.606|20101222144947.309|TR0|

20101222144949.011|20101222144950.714|TR0|happened was that the ad came 
20101222144950.714|20101222144952.416|TR0|out, and everybody who was 
20101222144952.416|20101222144954.119|TR0|working for whites, who had 
20101222144954.119|20101222144955.821|TR0|signed the petition, were fired 
20101222144955.821|20101222144957.523|TR0|immediately. Those who had some 
20101222144957.523|20101222144959.226|TR0|independence, like farmers or 
20101222144959.226|20101222145000.928|TR0|businessmen, found that the 
20101222145000.928|20101222145002.631|TR0|local banker, who was also a 
20101222145002.631|20101222145004.333|TR0|Citizens' Council member, 
20101222145004.333|20101222145006.035|TR0|wouldn't give them loans. So in 
20101222145006.035|20101222145007.738|TR0|the end, there were only two 
20101222145007.738|20101222145009.440|TR0|people left on the petition, and 
20101222145009.440|20101222145011.143|TR0|both of those had left the 
20101222145011.143|20101222145012.845|TR0|state. The Council was 
20101222145012.845|20101222145014.547|TR0|successful in preventing any 
20101222145014.547|20101222145016.250|TR0|Mississippi public schools from 
20101222145016.250|20101222145017.952|TR0|being desegregated until 1964.

20101222145021.357|20101222145023.060|TR0|about what happened to these 
20101222145023.060|20101222145024.762|TR0|families.

20101222145026.464|20101222145028.167|TR0|>> JOHN DITTMER: Well, these 
20101222145028.167|20101222145029.869|TR0|families were destitute, many of 
20101222145029.869|20101222145031.572|TR0|them. Once they took their names 
20101222145031.572|20101222145033.274|TR0|off the petitions, they were not 
20101222145033.274|20101222145034.976|TR0|able to get their jobs back. And 
20101222145034.976|20101222145036.679|TR0|this didn't happen only in Yazoo 
20101222145036.679|20101222145038.381|TR0|City. The NAACP had similar 
20101222145038.381|20101222145040.084|TR0|petition drives in Jackson, in 
20101222145040.084|20101222145041.786|TR0|Vicksburg and in Clarksdale, and 
20101222145041.786|20101222145043.489|TR0|the results were the same in 
20101222145043.489|20101222145045.191|TR0|each city. And the Citizens' 
20101222145045.191|20101222145046.893|TR0|Council was responsible for what 
20101222145046.893|20101222145048.596|TR0|happened.

20101222145052.001|20101222145053.703|TR0|from a New York Times article 
20101222145053.703|20101222145055.405|TR0|from - I think it was 1982. It 
20101222145055.405|20101222145057.108|TR0|reads, quote, "the racial

20101222145058.810|20101222145100.513|TR0|headquarters was suggested by an 
20101222145100.513|20101222145102.215|TR0|exchange between the candidate 
20101222145102.215|20101222145103.918|TR0|and an aide who complained that

20101222145107.322|20101222145109.025|TR0|fair. Embarrassed that a 
20101222145109.025|20101222145110.727|TR0|reporter heard this, Mr. Barbour 
20101222145110.727|20101222145112.430|TR0|warned that if the aide 
20101222145112.430|20101222145114.132|TR0|persisted in racist remarks, he 
20101222145114.132|20101222145115.834|TR0|would be reincarnated as a 
20101222145115.834|20101222145117.537|TR0|watermelon and placed at the

20101222145122.644|20101222145124.347|TR0|Barbour's comments. Another, 
20101222145124.347|20101222145126.049|TR0|Governor Barbour fondly 
20101222145126.049|20101222145127.751|TR0|remembered a black classmate at 
20101222145127.751|20101222145129.454|TR0|the University of Mississippi in 
20101222145129.454|20101222145131.156|TR0|1965, recalling his time there 
20101222145131.156|20101222145132.859|TR0|as "a very pleasant experience." 
20101222145132.859|20101222145134.561|TR0|Well, the classmate, Verna 
20101222145134.561|20101222145136.263|TR0|Bailey, recalls the time quite 
20101222145136.263|20101222145137.966|TR0|differently. She told McClatchy, 
20101222145137.966|20101222145139.668|TR0|quote, "I don't remember him at 
20101222145139.668|20101222145141.371|TR0|all, no, because during that 
20101222145141.371|20101222145143.073|TR0|time that certainly wasn't a 
20101222145143.073|20101222145144.775|TR0|pleasant experience for me. My 
20101222145144.775|20101222145146.478|TR0|interactions with white people 
20101222145146.478|20101222145148.180|TR0|were very, very limited. Very, 
20101222145148.180|20101222145149.883|TR0|very few reached out at all."

20101222145154.990|20101222145156.692|TR0|>> JOHN DITTMER: Well, in terms 
20101222145156.692|20101222145158.395|TR0|of the watermelon comment, Haley 
20101222145158.395|20101222145200.097|TR0|was just being a good old boy. 
20101222145200.097|20101222145201.800|TR0|But I think the larger 
20101222145201.800|20101222145203.502|TR0|implications of that and other 
20101222145203.502|20101222145205.204|TR0|statements are that Barbour and 
20101222145205.204|20101222145206.907|TR0|those like him - and I think 
20101222145206.907|20101222145208.609|TR0|it's important to know that he's 
20101222145208.609|20101222145210.312|TR0|not the only one who shares 
20101222145210.312|20101222145212.014|TR0|these feelings - the people who 
20101222145212.014|20101222145213.717|TR0|are in power in the South today 
20101222145213.717|20101222145215.419|TR0|are the sons and daughters of 
20101222145215.419|20101222145217.121|TR0|the people who were in power in 
20101222145217.121|20101222145218.824|TR0|the '50s and who were members of 
20101222145218.824|20101222145220.526|TR0|the Citizens' Council. So 
20101222145220.526|20101222145222.229|TR0|Barbour's generation then went 
20101222145222.229|20101222145223.931|TR0|through the civil rights 
20101222145223.931|20101222145225.633|TR0|movement, but they didn't seem 
20101222145225.633|20101222145227.336|TR0|to learn very much from it. I 
20101222145227.336|20101222145229.038|TR0|wouldn't put them in the 
20101222145229.038|20101222145230.741|TR0|classification of Holocaust 
20101222145230.741|20101222145232.443|TR0|deniers. They admitted that 
20101222145232.443|20101222145234.146|TR0|slavery and Jim Crow existed, 
20101222145234.146|20101222145235.848|TR0|but they said it wasn't such a 
20101222145235.848|20101222145237.550|TR0|big deal. As Barbour said, when 
20101222145237.550|20101222145239.253|TR0|there was a controversy over the 
20101222145239.253|20101222145240.955|TR0|governor of Virginia not 
20101222145240.955|20101222145242.658|TR0|mentioning slavery when talking 
20101222145242.658|20101222145244.360|TR0|about the Civil War, Barbour 
20101222145244.360|20101222145246.062|TR0|said it didn't amount to diddly.

20101222145421.398|20101222145423.100|TR0|which has done exactly the same 
20101222145423.100|20101222145424.802|TR0|thing in Mississippi for years. 
20101222145424.802|20101222145426.505|TR0|And far as I know, the 
20101222145426.505|20101222145428.207|TR0|Democratic legislature - we have 
20101222145428.207|20101222145429.910|TR0|a majority of both houses are 
20101222145429.910|20101222145431.612|TR0|Democrats. I'm unaware of them 
20101222145431.612|20101222145433.315|TR0|being criticized for it or them 
20101222145433.315|20101222145435.017|TR0|having their supporters feel 
20101222145435.017|20101222145436.719|TR0|uncomfortable with it.

20101222145440.124|20101222145441.827|TR0|I'm trying to get at here, is 
20101222145441.827|20101222145443.529|TR0|that there's a sort of feeling 
20101222145443.529|20101222145445.231|TR0|that it's insensitive. But you 
20101222145445.231|20101222145446.934|TR0|clearly don't agree.

20101222145450.339|20101222145452.041|TR0|it's a sort of feeling that it's 
20101222145452.041|20101222145453.744|TR0|a myth, that it is not 
20101222145453.744|20101222145455.446|TR0|significant, that it's not a - 
20101222145455.446|20101222145457.148|TR0|it's trying to make a big deal 
20101222145457.148|20101222145458.851|TR0|out of something that doesn't 
20101222145458.851|20101222145500.553|TR0|amount to diddly.

20101222145514.173|20101222145515.875|TR0|>> JOHN DITTMER: Well, I think 
20101222145515.875|20101222145517.577|TR0|what we're getting into here - 
20101222145517.577|20101222145519.280|TR0|and this goes beyond Mississippi 
20101222145519.280|20101222145520.982|TR0|- is that we're getting into the 
20101222145520.982|20101222145522.685|TR0|sesquicentennial of the Civil 
20101222145522.685|20101222145524.387|TR0|War, and there are going to be - 
20101222145524.387|20101222145526.089|TR0|it's going to be observed all 
20101222145526.089|20101222145527.792|TR0|throughout the South. And what 
20101222145527.792|20101222145529.494|TR0|we're finding as historians now 
20101222145529.494|20101222145531.197|TR0|is that we have to go back and 
20101222145531.197|20101222145532.899|TR0|talk again that slavery was the 
20101222145532.899|20101222145534.602|TR0|cause of the Civil War. What 
20101222145534.602|20101222145536.304|TR0|we're getting from many people 
20101222145536.304|20101222145538.006|TR0|in positions of authority in the 
20101222145538.006|20101222145539.709|TR0|South is, this was the war 
20101222145539.709|20101222145541.411|TR0|between the states. There are 
20101222145541.411|20101222145543.114|TR0|going to be celebrations, 
20101222145543.114|20101222145544.816|TR0|commemorations. And yet, the 
20101222145544.816|20101222145546.518|TR0|real reason for the war and the 
20101222145546.518|20101222145548.221|TR0|reasons why slavery existed in 
20101222145548.221|20101222145549.923|TR0|the first place are not going to 
20101222145549.923|20101222145551.626|TR0|be discussed. So this is part of 
20101222145551.626|20101222145553.328|TR0|a larger problem that we're 
20101222145553.328|20101222145555.030|TR0|going have to deal with, I 
20101222145555.030|20101222145556.733|TR0|think, on a regular basis.

20101222145558.435|20101222145600.138|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And this week, 
20101222145600.138|20101222145601.840|TR0|the NAACP organized a march in 
20101222145601.840|20101222145603.543|TR0|Charleston, South Carolina, to 
20101222145603.543|20101222145605.245|TR0|protest plans by Sons of 
20101222145605.245|20101222145606.947|TR0|Confederate Veterans to hold a 
20101222145606.947|20101222145608.650|TR0|ball to mark the 150th 
20101222145608.650|20101222145610.352|TR0|anniversary of South Carolina's 
20101222145610.352|20101222145612.055|TR0|secession from the Union and the 
20101222145612.055|20101222145613.757|TR0|start of the Civil War, the ball 
20101222145613.757|20101222145615.459|TR0|featuring a reenactment of the 
20101222145615.459|20101222145617.162|TR0|signing of South Carolina's 
20101222145617.162|20101222145618.864|TR0|Ordinance of Secession. Lonnie 
20101222145618.864|20101222145620.567|TR0|Randolph, the state president in 
20101222145620.567|20101222145622.269|TR0|the NAACP, saying this is 
20101222145622.269|20101222145623.972|TR0|nothing more than a celebration 
20101222145623.972|20101222145625.674|TR0|of slavery. This is all coming 
20101222145625.674|20101222145627.376|TR0|at this time, John Dittmer.
20101222145627.376|20101222145629.079|TR0|
20101222145629.079|20101222145630.781|TR0|>> JOHN DITTMER: Yes, it is. And 
20101222145630.781|20101222145632.484|TR0|I think that what is being done 
20101222145632.484|20101222145634.186|TR0|in some places is that we are 
20101222145634.186|20101222145635.888|TR0|going to look at those 
20101222145635.888|20101222145637.591|TR0|ordinances of secession. And 
20101222145637.591|20101222145639.293|TR0|they all state that, in effect, 
20101222145639.293|20101222145640.996|TR0|slavery was the cause of the 
20101222145640.996|20101222145642.698|TR0|war. So we've got to put that 
20101222145642.698|20101222145644.401|TR0|out front when we are talking 
20101222145644.401|20101222145646.103|TR0|about these events. And I think 
20101222145646.103|20101222145647.805|TR0|the NAA in Charleston is doing 
20101222145647.805|20101222145649.508|TR0|absolutely the right thing.
20101222145649.508|20101222145651.210|TR0|
20101222145651.210|20101222145652.913|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: One of the 
20101222145652.913|20101222145654.615|TR0|things Newsweek is reporting is 
20101222145654.615|20101222145656.317|TR0|that Governor Barbour has a 
20101222145656.317|20101222145658.020|TR0|Confederate flag signed by 
20101222145658.020|20101222145659.722|TR0|Jefferson Davis. Talk about the 
20101222145659.722|20101222145701.425|TR0|significance of this, and then 
20101222145701.425|20101222145703.127|TR0|go on to his prospects as a 
20101222145703.127|20101222145704.830|TR0|presidential candidate, with all 
20101222145704.830|20101222145706.532|TR0|of this coming out and these 
20101222145706.532|20101222145708.234|TR0|comments in the Weekly Standard.
20101222145708.234|20101222145709.937|TR0|
20101222145709.937|20101222145711.639|TR0|>> JOHN DITTMER: Well, the 
20101222145711.639|20101222145713.342|TR0|Confederate flag issue, of 
20101222145713.342|20101222145715.044|TR0|course, has been one that has 
20101222145715.044|20101222145716.746|TR0|been contentious for quite 
20101222145716.746|20101222145718.449|TR0|awhile, with whites who are 
20101222145718.449|20101222145720.151|TR0|displaying the flag, and proud 
20101222145720.151|20101222145721.854|TR0|of it, saying it doesn't really 
20101222145721.854|20101222145723.556|TR0|have anything to do with 
20101222145723.556|20101222145725.258|TR0|slavery, this is the lost cause, 
20101222145725.258|20101222145726.961|TR0|and people should get over it.
20101222145726.961|20101222145728.663|TR0|
20101222145728.663|20101222145730.366|TR0|In terms of Governor Barbour's 
20101222145730.366|20101222145732.068|TR0|presidential aspirations - and I 
20101222145732.068|20101222145733.771|TR0|think he does have them - I'm 
20101222145733.771|20101222145735.473|TR0|not really qualified to say what 
20101222145735.473|20101222145737.175|TR0|the effect will be. But I do 
20101222145737.175|20101222145738.878|TR0|anticipate that in the future, 
20101222145738.878|20101222145740.580|TR0|well, he will be doing other 
20101222145740.580|20101222145742.283|TR0|things to make us forget about 
20101222145742.283|20101222145743.985|TR0|this. For example, this spring 
20101222145743.985|20101222145745.687|TR0|in Mississippi, they are having 
20101222145745.687|20101222145747.390|TR0|- civil rights veterans are 
20101222145747.390|20101222145749.092|TR0|having a large celebration of 
20101222145749.092|20101222145750.795|TR0|the Freedom Rides. And I'm sure 
20101222145750.795|20101222145752.497|TR0|that Governor Barbour will 
20101222145752.497|20101222145754.200|TR0|invite himself to this event and 
20101222145754.200|20101222145755.902|TR0|try to take away the stigma that 
20101222145755.902|20101222145757.604|TR0|these remarks and others have 
20101222145757.604|20101222145759.307|TR0|caused. Whether he will be 
20101222145759.307|20101222145801.009|TR0|successful or not, I don't know.
20101222145801.009|20101222145802.712|TR0|
20101222145802.712|20101222145804.414|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Governor 
20101222145804.414|20101222145806.116|TR0|Barbour's spokesperson has 
20101222145806.116|20101222145807.819|TR0|insisted that Governor Barbour 
20101222145807.819|20101222145809.521|TR0|is not a racist. What do you 
20101222145809.521|20101222145811.224|TR0|think?
20101222145811.224|20101222145812.926|TR0|
20101222145812.926|20101222145814.629|TR0|>> JOHN DITTMER: Well, I think 
20101222145814.629|20101222145816.331|TR0|when you get to labeling people 
20101222145816.331|20101222145818.033|TR0|racist, it's like calling people 
20101222145818.033|20101222145819.736|TR0|Nazis. It's that the 
20101222145819.736|20101222145821.438|TR0|conversation veers away and 
20101222145821.438|20101222145823.141|TR0|becomes a matter of semantics. 
20101222145823.141|20101222145824.843|TR0|As I said, I think that Barbour 
20101222145824.843|20101222145826.545|TR0|is an unreconstructed Southerner 
20101222145826.545|20101222145828.248|TR0|and, as such, is not sensitive 
20101222145828.248|20101222145829.950|TR0|to the struggles of African 
20101222145829.950|20101222145831.653|TR0|Americans. And there's no 
20101222145831.653|20101222145833.355|TR0|indication, as governor or as 
20101222145833.355|20101222145835.057|TR0|president, that he would be 
20101222145835.057|20101222145836.760|TR0|sensitive. And I think this is 
20101222145836.760|20101222145838.462|TR0|the major issue. Whatever his 
20101222145838.462|20101222145840.165|TR0|motivations are, his conduct has 
20101222145840.165|20101222145841.867|TR0|been reprehensible.
