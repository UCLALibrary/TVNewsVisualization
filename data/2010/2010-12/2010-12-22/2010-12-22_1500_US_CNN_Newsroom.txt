20101222150007.000|20101222150009.000|TR0|KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR:   We'll begin 
20101222150009.000|20101222150011.000|TR0|this hour with breaking news out of 
20101222150011.000|20101222150013.000|TR0|Chicago.  Live pictures of an abandoned 
20101222150013.000|20101222150015.000|TR0|building on Chicago's south side.  Our 
20101222150015.000|20101222150017.000|TR0|affiliate WGN reporting that  three out of 
20101222150017.000|20101222150020.000|TR0|a possible four firefighters believed to 
20101222150020.000|20101222150022.000|TR0|be trapped inside have been rescued and 
20101222150022.000|20101222150024.000|TR0|rushed to area hospitals.  No word on 
20101222150024.000|20101222150026.000|TR0|their condition at this point.  Rescue 
20101222150026.000|20101222150028.000|TR0|crews and dozens of firefighters still 
20101222150028.000|20101222150031.000|TR0|sifting through that rubble.  That fire 
20101222150031.000|20101222150033.000|TR0|broke out about 6:54 a.m. this morning and 
20101222150033.000|20101222150035.000|TR0|fire crews are having problems with frozen 
20101222150035.000|20101222150037.000|TR0|hydrants and within 11 min minutes came a 
20101222150037.000|20101222150039.000|TR0|may day call indicating the trapped 
20101222150039.000|20101222150042.000|TR0|firefighters were inside.
20101222150042.000|20101222150044.000|TR0|
20101222150044.000|20101222150046.000|TR0|23 degrees right now.  11 degrees 
20101222150046.000|20101222150048.000|TR0|windchill.  The snow picking up.  We're 
20101222150048.000|20101222150050.000|TR0|going to keep you updated on this story.
20101222150050.000|20101222150053.000|TR0|
20101222150053.000|20101222150055.000|TR0|And by the way, how is this for just 
20101222150055.000|20101222150057.000|TR0|irony.  Today is the 100 year anniversary 
20101222150057.000|20101222150059.000|TR0|of the stockyard fire in Chicago that 
20101222150059.000|20101222150101.000|TR0|killed several firefighters.
20101222150101.000|20101222150104.000|TR0|
20101222150104.000|20101222150106.000|TR0|Well, the weather is absolutely punishing 
20101222150106.000|20101222150108.000|TR0|southern California right now.  The rain 
20101222150108.000|20101222150110.000|TR0|just won't let up.  Two inches falling per 
20101222150110.000|20101222150112.000|TR0|hour in some places.  This is Laguna 
20101222150112.000|20101222150115.000|TR0|Beach.  Police actually shut down most of 
20101222150115.000|20101222150117.000|TR0|downtown because of the  flooding, mud 
20101222150117.000|20101222150119.000|TR0|slides, flood water, debris threatening 
20101222150119.000|20101222150121.000|TR0|houses in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
20101222150121.000|20101222150123.000|TR0| Flash flooding is a big threat in San 
20101222150123.000|20101222150126.000|TR0|Diego county as well.  Several other 
20101222150126.000|20101222150128.000|TR0|counties in so much trouble that the 
20101222150128.000|20101222150130.000|TR0|governor has now made an emergency 
20101222150130.000|20101222150132.000|TR0|declaration.
20101222150132.000|20101222150134.000|TR0|
20101222150134.000|20101222150137.000|TR0|CNN's Paul Vercammen reports from La 
20101222150137.000|20101222150139.000|TR0|Canada, from the La Canada, Flintridge 
20101222150139.000|20101222150141.000|TR0|area.  It's about 20 minutes from downtown 
20101222150141.000|20101222150143.000|TR0|L.A..

20101222150145.000|20101222150148.000|TR0|PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So far 
20101222150148.000|20101222150150.000|TR0|so good in these foothill communities 
20101222150150.000|20101222150152.000|TR0|below a major burn area in southern 
20101222150152.000|20101222150154.000|TR0|California. No mudslides.  But still more 
20101222150154.000|20101222150156.000|TR0|rain is on the way.

20101222150203.000|20101222150205.000|TR0|VERCAMMEN (voice-over):  After days of 
20101222150205.000|20101222150207.000|TR0|rain, things are going from bad to worse 
20101222150207.000|20101222150209.000|TR0|in southern California.  It's been raining 
20101222150209.000|20101222150212.000|TR0|for almost a week, causing flooding and 
20101222150212.000|20101222150214.000|TR0|mudslides, forcing officials to issue 
20101222150214.000|20101222150216.000|TR0|evacuation orders in some foothill areas.
20101222150216.000|20101222150218.000|TR0|
20101222150218.000|20101222150220.000|TR0|DEPUTY CHIEF MIKE METRO, LOS ANGELES FIRE 
20101222150220.000|20101222150223.000|TR0|DEPT.:  I cannot overemphasize the  
20101222150223.000|20101222150225.000|TR0|magnitude of this storm that's bearing 
20101222150225.000|20101222150227.000|TR0|down upon us right now.  Some say more 
20101222150227.000|20101222150229.000|TR0|rain than we have seen in the last 10 
20101222150229.000|20101222150231.000|TR0|years.
20101222150231.000|20101222150234.000|TR0|
20101222150234.000|20101222150236.000|TR0|VERCAMMEN:  More than 10 inches of rain 
20101222150236.000|20101222150238.000|TR0|has fallen in parts of southern California 
20101222150238.000|20101222150240.000|TR0|causing accidents and in some cases, 
20101222150240.000|20101222150242.000|TR0|drivers abandoned their cars in 
20101222150242.000|20101222150245.000|TR0|floodwaters.  It's all due to a series of 
20101222150245.000|20101222150247.000|TR0|storms from the Pacific trailing along 
20101222150247.000|20101222150249.000|TR0|what's known as the Pineapple Express.  
20101222150249.000|20101222150251.000|TR0|The storms have also brought more than a 
20101222150251.000|20101222150253.000|TR0|dozen feet of snow in some parts of the 
20101222150253.000|20101222150256.000|TR0|Sierra Nevada.  The rain has also 
20101222150256.000|20101222150258.000|TR0|triggered heavy flooding outside Las Vegas.
20101222150258.000|20101222150300.000|TR0|
20101222150300.000|20101222150302.000|TR0|In the town of Mesquite, residents were 
20101222150302.000|20101222150304.000|TR0|encouraged to voluntarily evacuate on 
20101222150304.000|20101222150307.000|TR0|Tuesday.  And a state of emergency has 
20101222150307.000|20101222150309.000|TR0|been declared.  For many along the West 
20101222150309.000|20101222150311.000|TR0|Coast, the holidays fast approaching 
20101222150311.000|20101222150313.000|TR0|wrapped in uncertainty.

20101222150315.000|20101222150318.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I've got all my 
20101222150318.000|20101222150320.000|TR0|Christmas presents in the trunk and if 
20101222150320.000|20101222150322.000|TR0|they call they call.  You know, if we have 
20101222150322.000|20101222150324.000|TR0|to delay Christmas by a few days, that's 
20101222150324.000|20101222150326.000|TR0|fine.

20101222150331.000|20101222150333.000|TR0|
20101222150333.000|20101222150335.000|TR0|VERCAMMEN:  A state of emergency has been 
20101222150335.000|20101222150337.000|TR0|declared in a half a dozen southern 
20101222150337.000|20101222150340.000|TR0|California counties.  Now back to you.
20101222150340.000|20101222150342.000|TR0|
20101222150342.000|20101222150344.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   All right.  Paul Vercammen, 
20101222150344.000|20101222150346.000|TR0|thanks so much.  Our Rob Marciano also 
20101222150346.000|20101222150348.000|TR0|watching all these for us.
20101222150348.000|20101222150350.000|TR0|
20101222150350.000|20101222150353.000|TR0|So Rob, what do you think?  Is it going to 
20101222150353.000|20101222150355.000|TR0|let up?  Is it going to get worse?
20101222150355.000|20101222150357.000|TR0|
20101222150357.000|20101222150359.000|TR0|ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  It's 
20101222150359.000|20101222150401.000|TR0|going to get briefly worse and then let up.
20101222150401.000|20101222150404.000|TR0|
20101222150404.000|20101222150406.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   OK.
20101222150406.000|20101222150408.000|TR0|
20101222150408.000|20101222150410.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  So we're just getting -- try to 
20101222150410.000|20101222150412.000|TR0|push power through this, the last half of 
20101222150412.000|20101222150415.000|TR0|the storm is beginning to make its way 
20101222150415.000|20101222150417.000|TR0|towards the West Coast.  There it is.  
20101222150417.000|20101222150419.000|TR0|That's the last surge.  Behind it though 
20101222150419.000|20101222150421.000|TR0|is some colder air and that could produce 
20101222150421.000|20101222150423.000|TR0|some thunderstorms and some of those could 
20101222150423.000|20101222150426.000|TR0|become severe later on  today.
20101222150426.000|20101222150428.000|TR0|
20101222150428.000|20101222150430.000|TR0|So the heaviest amounts of rain right now 
20101222150430.000|20101222150432.000|TR0|are really focused on the extreme southern 
20101222150432.000|20101222150434.000|TR0|California, actually the Mexican border as 
20101222150434.000|20101222150437.000|TR0|well, just south of San Diego, east of Los 
20101222150437.000|20101222150439.000|TR0|Angeles we have seen and south of Los 
20101222150439.000|20101222150441.000|TR0|Angeles, we've seen some mudslides and 
20101222150441.000|20101222150443.000|TR0|flash flooding across eastern parts of 
20101222150443.000|20101222150445.000|TR0|Orange County.  And then now moving up 
20101222150445.000|20101222150448.000|TR0|into Vegas. This is where some of the 
20101222150448.000|20101222150450.000|TR0|heavier rains have been the past 12 hours 
20101222150450.000|20101222150452.000|TR0|and flash flood warning out for much of 
20101222150452.000|20101222150454.000|TR0|the Las Vegas Valley.
20101222150454.000|20101222150456.000|TR0|
20101222150456.000|20101222150459.000|TR0|I think we've just got some video coming 
20101222150459.000|20101222150501.000|TR0|in the CNN NEWSROOM highlighting just that 
20101222150501.000|20101222150503.000|TR0|dangerous situation here.  You get a 
20101222150503.000|20101222150505.000|TR0|quarter of an inch of rain in Vegas and 
20101222150505.000|20101222150507.000|TR0|that produces problems.  We already saw 
20101222150507.000|20101222150510.000|TR0|half an inch a day before yesterday.  We 
20101222150510.000|20101222150512.000|TR0|got more rain on top of that. And this 
20101222150512.000|20101222150514.000|TR0|city and the surrounding areas just cannot 
20101222150514.000|20101222150516.000|TR0|handle this sort of moisture.  And we 
20101222150516.000|20101222150518.000|TR0|expect the rains to continue in southern 
20101222150518.000|20101222150521.000|TR0|Nevada for another 12 hours, potentially 
20101222150521.000|20101222150523.000|TR0|steadily.
20101222150523.000|20101222150525.000|TR0|
20101222150525.000|20101222150527.000|TR0|So the flash flood watches and flash flood 
20101222150527.000|20101222150529.000|TR0|warnings are out now for southern parts of 
20101222150529.000|20101222150532.000|TR0|Nevada and eastern parts of southern 
20101222150532.000|20101222150534.000|TR0|California with this system that's about 
20101222150534.000|20101222150536.000|TR0|to push through.  I think once we get 
20101222150536.000|20101222150538.000|TR0|through tonight then we will turn the 
20101222150538.000|20101222150540.000|TR0|spigot off.  But until then, the danger is 
20101222150540.000|20101222150542.000|TR0|certainly high.  And the freezing levels 
20101222150542.000|20101222150545.000|TR0|are dropping with this colder air.  So 
20101222150545.000|20101222150547.000|TR0|we've got a number of winter  storm 
20101222150547.000|20101222150549.000|TR0|warnings that are posted.
20101222150549.000|20101222150551.000|TR0|
20101222150551.000|20101222150553.000|TR0|We could see one to four feet additionally 
20101222150553.000|20101222150556.000|TR0|across an area that have already seen 
20101222150556.000|20101222150558.000|TR0|three and four feet.  That is great news 
20101222150558.000|20101222150600.000|TR0|for obviously skiers starting to build 
20101222150600.000|20101222150602.000|TR0|that base and skiers that are already out 
20101222150602.000|20101222150604.000|TR0|there.  Avalanche danger is certainly  
20101222150604.000|20101222150607.000|TR0|high.  Eastern half of the country not 
20101222150607.000|20101222150609.000|TR0|looking bad at all.  Actually just 
20101222150609.000|20101222150611.000|TR0|seasonably cool but precipitation levels 
20101222150611.000|20101222150613.000|TR0|will be low.  And this storm that will 
20101222150613.000|20101222150615.000|TR0|push east, Kyra, will likely stay below 
20101222150615.000|20101222150618.000|TR0|the major cities as far as producing havoc 
20101222150618.000|20101222150620.000|TR0|for winter travel.  So at least right now 
20101222150620.000|20101222150622.000|TR0|we're looking good.  Back over to you.
20101222150622.000|20101222150624.000|TR0|
20101222150624.000|20101222150626.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   All right.   We'll keep 
20101222150626.000|20101222150629.000|TR0|talking.  Thanks, Rob.
20101222150629.000|20101222150631.000|TR0|
20101222150631.000|20101222150633.000|TR0|MARCIANO:  All right.
20101222150633.000|20101222150635.000|TR0|
20101222150635.000|20101222150637.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And we are expecting any minute 
20101222150637.000|20101222150640.000|TR0|now the White House press briefing  to 
20101222150640.000|20101222150642.000|TR0|begin.  Possibly the president coming out. 
20101222150642.000|20101222150644.000|TR0| We're not quite sure.  Maybe he will take 
20101222150644.000|20101222150646.000|TR0|questions regarding today's historic 
20101222150646.000|20101222150648.000|TR0|signing of the repeal of "don't  ask, 
20101222150648.000|20101222150651.000|TR0|don't tell."  But we are monitoring this 
20101222150651.000|20101222150653.000|TR0|and we will take it live as soon as it 
20101222150653.000|20101222150655.000|TR0|happens.
20101222150655.000|20101222150657.000|TR0|
20101222150657.000|20101222150659.000|TR0|And as we mentioned, just moments ago, the 
20101222150659.000|20101222150702.000|TR0|president did formally sign that repeal of 
20101222150702.000|20101222150704.000|TR0|"don't ask, don't tell," enacted in 1993.  
20101222150704.000|20101222150706.000|TR0|That policy allowed gay men and lesbians 
20101222150706.000|20101222150708.000|TR0|to serve in the military but only if they 
20101222150708.000|20101222150710.000|TR0|kept their sexuality a secret.  Well, 
20101222150710.000|20101222150713.000|TR0|since it was put in place, that policy 
20101222150713.000|20101222150715.000|TR0|forced the discharge of some 14,000 men 
20101222150715.000|20101222150717.000|TR0|and women in uniform.  It will likely take 
20101222150717.000|20101222150719.000|TR0|several months to implement now.
20101222150719.000|20101222150721.000|TR0|
20101222150721.000|20101222150724.000|TR0|A recent poll shows the public is 
20101222150724.000|20101222150726.000|TR0|overwhelmingly in favor of the repeal.  
20101222150726.000|20101222150728.000|TR0|According to the "Washington Post," ABC 
20101222150728.000|20101222150730.000|TR0|News poll, 77 percent of Americans believe 
20101222150730.000|20101222150732.000|TR0|homosexuals should openly serve in the 
20101222150732.000|20101222150734.000|TR0|military. 21 percent oppose the idea.  
20101222150734.000|20101222150737.000|TR0|Here is what President Obama said just 
20101222150737.000|20101222150739.000|TR0|about an hour ago at the signing.

20101222150840.000|20101222150843.000|TR0|Good morning, everyone.  As we enter the

20101222150851.000|20101222150854.000|TR0|prevent terrorists from disrupting the 
20101222150854.000|20101222150856.000|TR0|safety and security of Americans as they 
20101222150856.000|20101222150858.000|TR0|travel, spend time with family and friends 
20101222150858.000|20101222150900.000|TR0|and enjoy holiday festivities both at home 
20101222150900.000|20101222150902.000|TR0| and abroad.
20101222150902.000|20101222150905.000|TR0|
20101222150905.000|20101222150907.000|TR0|We remain vigilant to attempts by Al Qaeda 
20101222150907.000|20101222150909.000|TR0|and other terrorist organizations to carry 
20101222150909.000|20101222150911.000|TR0|out cowardly attacks against innocent men 
20101222150911.000|20101222150913.000|TR0|women and children.  And we are working 
20101222150913.000|20101222150916.000|TR0|very closely with other governments, to 
20101222150916.000|20101222150918.000|TR0|share all threat information immediately 
20101222150918.000|20101222150920.000|TR0|and to coordinate closely our counter

20101222150922.000|20101222150924.000|TR0|
20101222150924.000|20101222150926.000|TR0|These international partnerships are 
20101222150926.000|20101222150929.000|TR0|critically important to our ability to 
20101222150929.000|20101222150931.000|TR0|identify would be terrorists and to thwart 
20101222150931.000|20101222150933.000|TR0|their plans before they are able to act.  
20101222150933.000|20101222150935.000|TR0|In response to President Obama's 
20101222150935.000|20101222150937.000|TR0|direction, senior officials from 
20101222150937.000|20101222150940.000|TR0|departments and agencies met yesterday at

20101222150942.000|20101222150944.000|TR0|threat reporting and to coordinate 
20101222150944.000|20101222150946.000|TR0|security and counter terrorism plans that 
20101222150946.000|20101222150948.000|TR0|will be in place during the holiday season.

20101222150951.000|20101222150953.000|TR0|Finally, President Obama has been provided 
20101222150953.000|20101222150955.000|TR0|an update on the many steps that have been 
20101222150955.000|20101222150957.000|TR0|taken over the past year to enhance our 
20101222150957.000|20101222150959.000|TR0|counter terrorism capabilities as a result 
20101222150959.000|20101222151002.000|TR0|of the after action reviews on several

20101222151004.000|20101222151006.000|TR0|including the tragic shooting at Fort Hood 
20101222151006.000|20101222151008.000|TR0|Texas.  The attempted bombings of

20101222151019.000|20101222151021.000|TR0|These enhancements include protocols for 
20101222151021.000|20101222151024.000|TR0|strengthened cooperation and information

20101222151037.000|20101222151039.000|TR0|information technology systems that 
20101222151039.000|20101222151041.000|TR0|service the counter terrorism community.

20101222151054.000|20101222151057.000|TR0|Protecting the American people from the 
20101222151057.000|20101222151059.000|TR0|scourge of terrorism is an ongoing and 
20101222151059.000|20101222151101.000|TR0|constantly evolving process.  It is the 
20101222151101.000|20101222151103.000|TR0|goal of the counter terrorism community to 
20101222151103.000|20101222151105.000|TR0|a stay several steps ahead of our 
20101222151105.000|20101222151108.000|TR0|terrorist adversaries so we can stop them 
20101222151108.000|20101222151110.000|TR0|dead in their tracks before they are able 
20101222151110.000|20101222151112.000|TR0|to carry out small scale or potentially 
20101222151112.000|20101222151114.000|TR0|devastating attacks.  That is what the 
20101222151114.000|20101222151116.000|TR0|president has corrected.  That is what the 
20101222151116.000|20101222151118.000|TR0|American people rightly expect and deserve 
20101222151118.000|20101222151121.000|TR0|and that is what we are bound and 
20101222151121.000|20101222151123.000|TR0|determined to do.  Thank you.

20101222151127.000|20101222151129.000|TR0|wondering if you have any - I know, you 
20101222151129.000|20101222151132.000|TR0|can't talk specifically about any 
20101222151132.000|20101222151134.000|TR0|intelligence but is there anything out 
20101222151134.000|20101222151136.000|TR0|there that you know about at this point 
20101222151136.000|20101222151138.000|TR0|that's kind of driving this stepped up 
20101222151138.000|20101222151140.000|TR0|effort?
20101222151140.000|20101222151143.000|TR0|
20101222151143.000|20101222151145.000|TR0|BRENNAN:  Well, as we have discussed 
20101222151145.000|20101222151147.000|TR0|previously we are concerned about Al 
20101222151147.000|20101222151149.000|TR0|Qaeda's plans to carry out attacks and the 
20101222151149.000|20101222151151.000|TR0|Department of State had issued an advisory 
20101222151151.000|20101222151154.000|TR0|about Europe and about plans by Al Qaeda 
20101222151154.000|20101222151156.000|TR0|to try to carry out attacks there.  We do 
20101222151156.000|20101222151158.000|TR0|not limit our focus to one geographic 
20101222151158.000|20101222151200.000|TR0|area.  That's why we are constantly 
20101222151200.000|20101222151202.000|TR0|looking at whether or not there is 
20101222151202.000|20101222151205.000|TR0|something that is directed at the homeland 
20101222151205.000|20101222151207.000|TR0|here.  We always receive reporting.  What 
20101222151207.000|20101222151209.000|TR0|we try to do is investigate it and to 
20101222151209.000|20101222151211.000|TR0|scrutinize it very carefully so we need to 
20101222151211.000|20101222151213.000|TR0|be on top of our game particularly during 
20101222151213.000|20101222151216.000|TR0|the holiday season but throughout the year.
20101222151216.000|20101222151218.000|TR0|
20101222151218.000|20101222151220.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All right.  It seems 
20101222151220.000|20101222151222.000|TR0|as though in the past there was a primary 
20101222151222.000|20101222151224.000|TR0|focus on a single catastrophic attack and 
20101222151224.000|20101222151227.000|TR0|it sounds like that has been  shifting to 
20101222151227.000|20101222151229.000|TR0|a concern about multiple small attacks.  
20101222151229.000|20101222151231.000|TR0|Is that an accurate description of what 
20101222151231.000|20101222151233.000|TR0|the landscape is right now?
20101222151233.000|20101222151235.000|TR0|
20101222151235.000|20101222151238.000|TR0|BRENNAN:  Well, I think we're concerned 
20101222151238.000|20101222151240.000|TR0|and we are staying vigilant about both 
20101222151240.000|20101222151242.000|TR0|ends of that spectrum as far as the large 
20101222151242.000|20101222151244.000|TR0|scale attack as well as smaller scale 
20101222151244.000|20101222151246.000|TR0|ones.  But I think the enhancements that 
20101222151246.000|20101222151249.000|TR0|we have made to our security over the past 
20101222151249.000|20101222151251.000|TR0|decade has made it more difficult for 
20101222151251.000|20101222151253.000|TR0|terrorists to conduct these large scale 
20101222151253.000|20101222151255.000|TR0|attacks. We have degraded their 
20101222151255.000|20101222151257.000|TR0|capabilities.  We have degraded their 
20101222151257.000|20101222151300.000|TR0|training capabilities and ability to plot 
20101222151300.000|20101222151302.000|TR0|and move operatives.
20101222151302.000|20101222151304.000|TR0|
20101222151304.000|20101222151306.000|TR0|So what we have seen recently is increased 
20101222151306.000|20101222151308.000|TR0|focus, I think, on the part of terrorist 
20101222151308.000|20101222151310.000|TR0|groups to try to carry out some of these 
20101222151310.000|20101222151313.000|TR0|smaller scale attacks.  And so we are 
20101222151313.000|20101222151315.000|TR0|staying very focused on our ability to 
20101222151315.000|20101222151317.000|TR0|detect those types of attacks and stop 
20101222151317.000|20101222151319.000|TR0|them whether or not they are by 
20101222151319.000|20101222151321.000|TR0|individuals or they are part of a larger 
20101222151321.000|20101222151324.000|TR0|organizational effort.
20101222151324.000|20101222151326.000|TR0|

20101222151330.000|20101222151332.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. Brennan, should 
20101222151332.000|20101222151335.000|TR0|your statement alarm Americans or reassure 
20101222151335.000|20101222151337.000|TR0|them that they will be safe?
20101222151337.000|20101222151339.000|TR0|
20101222151339.000|20101222151341.000|TR0|BRENNAN:  I think what the statement is 
20101222151341.000|20101222151343.000|TR0|intended to do is to reassure Americans 
20101222151343.000|20101222151346.000|TR0|that there are fellow Americans who are 
20101222151346.000|20101222151348.000|TR0|working in the Homeland Security, law  
20101222151348.000|20101222151350.000|TR0|enforcement and intelligence communities, 
20101222151350.000|20101222151352.000|TR0|working around the clock to protect their 
20101222151352.000|20101222151354.000|TR0|fellow citizens.  We will not rest because 
20101222151354.000|20101222151357.000|TR0|we know that Al Qaeda and other  
20101222151357.000|20101222151359.000|TR0|organizations are still out there.  We are 
20101222151359.000|20101222151401.000|TR0|going to do our best to disrupt  these 
20101222151401.000|20101222151403.000|TR0|plots and their plans before they ever 
20101222151403.000|20101222151405.000|TR0|make it to the homeland.
20101222151405.000|20101222151408.000|TR0|
20101222151408.000|20101222151410.000|TR0|And so what we want to do is to let the 
20101222151410.000|20101222151412.000|TR0|American people know that we are on the 
20101222151412.000|20101222151414.000|TR0|job.  We're staying vigilant.  We are 
20101222151414.000|20101222151416.000|TR0|working with our partners, and not just 
20101222151416.000|20101222151419.000|TR0|our international partners with our state 
20101222151419.000|20101222151421.000|TR0|and local partners as well and we will do 
20101222151421.000|20101222151423.000|TR0|so through the holiday season and beyond.
20101222151423.000|20101222151425.000|TR0|
20101222151425.000|20101222151427.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just to follow up on 
20101222151427.000|20101222151430.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) point, (INAUDIBLE) is there a 
20101222151430.000|20101222151432.000|TR0|particular concern during the holidays 
20101222151432.000|20101222151434.000|TR0|given the enormity of passenger travel?
20101222151434.000|20101222151436.000|TR0|
20101222151436.000|20101222151438.000|TR0|BRENNAN:  Well, I think as you pointed out 
20101222151438.000|20101222151441.000|TR0|there is a fair amount of volume that is 
20101222151441.000|20101222151443.000|TR0|going through the different transportation 
20101222151443.000|20101222151445.000|TR0|sector whether it be aviation, rail and 
20101222151445.000|20101222151447.000|TR0|other areas.  So what we want to do is to 
20101222151447.000|20101222151449.000|TR0|make sure that we are able to provide the 
20101222151449.000|20101222151452.000|TR0|security to the traveling public.
20101222151452.000|20101222151454.000|TR0|
20101222151454.000|20101222151456.000|TR0|We also want to make sure that we run to 
20101222151456.000|20101222151458.000|TR0|ground any type of report out there about 
20101222151458.000|20101222151500.000|TR0|a threat to the American people.  So, I 
20101222151500.000|20101222151502.000|TR0|think as Secretary Napolitano said the 
20101222151502.000|20101222151505.000|TR0|other day as far as something specific and 
20101222151505.000|20101222151507.000|TR0|credible, we don't see that.  There is a 
20101222151507.000|20101222151509.000|TR0|constant stream of reporting throughout 
20101222151509.000|20101222151511.000|TR0|the course of the year about Al Qaeda's 
20101222151511.000|20101222151513.000|TR0|plans. Sometimes we have that warning.  
20101222151513.000|20101222151516.000|TR0|We're not going to wait for a tactical 
20101222151516.000|20101222151518.000|TR0|warning.  We're going to be poised every 
20101222151518.000|20101222151520.000|TR0|day.

20101222151527.000|20101222151529.000|TR0|bomber there was intelligence gathered in 
20101222151529.000|20101222151531.000|TR0|the field that wasn't clearly shared, with 
20101222151531.000|20101222151533.000|TR0|the appropriate people (INAUDIBLE) to 
20101222151533.000|20101222151535.000|TR0|execution.  Are you confident now that 
20101222151535.000|20101222151538.000|TR0|that situation won't happen again?
20101222151538.000|20101222151540.000|TR0|
20101222151540.000|20101222151542.000|TR0|BRENNAN:  I'm absolutely confident that 
20101222151542.000|20101222151544.000|TR0|the deficiencies identified in the system 
20101222151544.000|20101222151546.000|TR0|as a result of the after action review of 
20101222151546.000|20101222151549.000|TR0|the Christmas Day bomber have been 
20101222151549.000|20101222151551.000|TR0|addressed and some of the reasons why 
20101222151551.000|20101222151553.000|TR0|certain information was not shared, 
20101222151553.000|20101222151555.000|TR0|certain information did not make it 
20101222151555.000|20101222151557.000|TR0|through system.  We have taken steps to 
20101222151557.000|20101222151600.000|TR0|ensure that that type of problem does not 
20101222151600.000|20101222151602.000|TR0|happen again.
20101222151602.000|20101222151604.000|TR0|
20101222151604.000|20101222151606.000|TR0|So one of the things that President Obama 
20101222151606.000|20101222151608.000|TR0|has insisted that we do on each of these 
20101222151608.000|20101222151611.000|TR0|incidents is to take a look back and to 
20101222151611.000|20101222151613.000|TR0|see where the system worked well.  Where 
20101222151613.000|20101222151615.000|TR0|it fell down.  What changes we could make 
20101222151615.000|20101222151617.000|TR0|either in information technology or in 
20101222151617.000|20101222151619.000|TR0|business processes.

20101222151622.000|20101222151624.000|TR0|And so I'm confident that those 
20101222151624.000|20101222151626.000|TR0|deficiencies we identified as a result of 
20101222151626.000|20101222151628.000|TR0|previous reviews are being addressed and 
20101222151628.000|20101222151630.000|TR0|we are in a much better position today 
20101222151630.000|20101222151633.000|TR0|than we were last year at that time.

20101222151703.000|20101222151705.000|TR0|and Secretary Napolitano did, how that's 
20101222151705.000|20101222151708.000|TR0|possible that hours later you had not been 
20101222151708.000|20101222151710.000|TR0|told -
20101222151710.000|20101222151712.000|TR0|
20101222151712.000|20101222151714.000|TR0|BRENNAN:  I would be pleased to address 
20101222151714.000|20101222151716.000|TR0|that question.

20101222151721.000|20101222151723.000|TR0|
20101222151723.000|20101222151725.000|TR0|Let me address your first question first 
20101222151725.000|20101222151727.000|TR0|and I will defer to my British counter 
20101222151727.000|20101222151730.000|TR0|parts to provide information about their 
20101222151730.000|20101222151732.000|TR0|investigation.  We are in constant contact 
20101222151732.000|20101222151734.000|TR0|with the British.  We were since the 
20101222151734.000|20101222151736.000|TR0|beginning of this take-down of the  
20101222151736.000|20101222151738.000|TR0|individuals in Britain to work with them 
20101222151738.000|20101222151741.000|TR0|closely to find out whether or not there 
20101222151741.000|20101222151743.000|TR0|is any nexus to the homeland.  Find out 
20101222151743.000|20101222151745.000|TR0|what we can about their motivations and 
20101222151745.000|20101222151747.000|TR0|intentions and where their operational 
20101222151747.000|20101222151749.000|TR0|planning was going.  So that is ongoing.

20101222151752.000|20101222151754.000|TR0|On the second issue, Jim Clapper is I 
20101222151754.000|20101222151756.000|TR0|think the consummate DNI. He was working 
20101222151756.000|20101222151758.000|TR0|on developments in the Korean peninsula, 
20101222151758.000|20101222151800.000|TR0|in terms of political military 
20101222151800.000|20101222151803.000|TR0|development.  He was focused on trying to 
20101222151803.000|20101222151805.000|TR0|provide support to the Congress as far as 
20101222151805.000|20101222151807.000|TR0|the S.T.A.R.T. treaty deliberations were 
20101222151807.000|20101222151809.000|TR0|concerned.  He was engaged in a variety of 
20101222151809.000|20101222151811.000|TR0|classified matters. Should he have been 
20101222151811.000|20101222151814.000|TR0|briefed by a staff on those arrests?  Yes. 
20101222151814.000|20101222151816.000|TR0| I know there was breathless attention by 
20101222151816.000|20101222151818.000|TR0|the media about these arrests and it was 
20101222151818.000|20101222151820.000|TR0|constantly on the news networks.
20101222151820.000|20101222151822.000|TR0|
20101222151822.000|20101222151825.000|TR0|I am glad that Jim Clapper is not sitting 
20101222151825.000|20101222151827.000|TR0|in front of the TV 24 hours a day and 
20101222151827.000|20101222151829.000|TR0|monitoring what is coming out of the 
20101222151829.000|20101222151831.000|TR0|media.  What he is doing, he is focusing 
20101222151831.000|20101222151833.000|TR0|on those intelligence issues that the 
20101222151833.000|20101222151836.000|TR0|president expects him to focus on and to 
20101222151836.000|20101222151838.000|TR0|make sure that we don't have conflict in 
20101222151838.000|20101222151840.000|TR0|different parts of the world.  He 
20101222151840.000|20101222151842.000|TR0|continues to focus on those.  And his not 
20101222151842.000|20101222151844.000|TR0|being briefed yesterday afternoon this is 
20101222151844.000|20101222151846.000|TR0|something that they have acknowledged that 
20101222151846.000|20101222151849.000|TR0|he should have been briefed on.  They have 
20101222151849.000|20101222151851.000|TR0|taken steps to correct that.  Now, if that 
20101222151851.000|20101222151853.000|TR0|happens again, I am sure that he is going 
20101222151853.000|20101222151855.000|TR0|to be (INAUDIBLE) as far as the takedown 
20101222151855.000|20101222151857.000|TR0|overseas.

20101222151902.000|20101222151904.000|TR0|followup.  Is that - by implications, are 
20101222151904.000|20101222151906.000|TR0|you suggesting that the arrest or the 
20101222151906.000|20101222151908.000|TR0|threat was not serious enough to have 
20101222151908.000|20101222151911.000|TR0|risen to that level?
20101222151911.000|20101222151913.000|TR0|
20101222151913.000|20101222151915.000|TR0|BRENNAN:  No, what I'm suggesting was 
20101222151915.000|20101222151917.000|TR0|there was the sharing of the information 
20101222151917.000|20101222151919.000|TR0|from the British to U.S. officials.  We 
20101222151919.000|20101222151922.000|TR0|were in touch with the British throughout 
20101222151922.000|20101222151924.000|TR0|the day and continued to be so.  There was 
20101222151924.000|20101222151926.000|TR0|no action that the DNI had to take.  There 
20101222151926.000|20101222151928.000|TR0|was nothing that was required of him to do 
20101222151928.000|20101222151930.000|TR0|so he was focused on  those matters that 
20101222151930.000|20101222151933.000|TR0|required his direct and personal 
20101222151933.000|20101222151935.000|TR0|attention.  And he was giving full 
20101222151935.000|20101222151937.000|TR0|attention to those matters.  The president 
20101222151937.000|20101222151939.000|TR0|was very appreciative that he was focused 
20101222151939.000|20101222151941.000|TR0|on that.  There is going to be a continued 
20101222151941.000|20101222151944.000|TR0|interaction on the British on this.  There 
20101222151944.000|20101222151946.000|TR0|maybe things that the DNI person will need 
20101222151946.000|20101222151948.000|TR0|to be involved in but as of that time, 
20101222151948.000|20101222151950.000|TR0|there was nothing that the DNI needed to 
20101222151950.000|20101222151952.000|TR0|do or to be engaged in that would have 
20101222151952.000|20101222151955.000|TR0|required him to set aside other pressing  
20101222151955.000|20101222151957.000|TR0|intelligence matters to get briefed on 
20101222151957.000|20101222151959.000|TR0|things that were being put out in the

20101222152017.000|20101222152019.000|TR0|You said there is currently no credible 
20101222152019.000|20101222152021.000|TR0|specific imminent threat? Is that correct?

20101222152023.000|20101222152025.000|TR0|GIBBS:  We will send around the transcript

20101222152028.000|20101222152030.000|TR0|the earlier questions.  And I hope you

20101222152034.000|20101222152036.000|TR0|you heard John say the  corrective actions 
20101222152036.000|20101222152038.000|TR0|and the result of the president's asking 
20101222152038.000|20101222152041.000|TR0|for after action reports on incidents and 
20101222152041.000|20101222152043.000|TR0|disruptions that have taken place over the

20101222152047.000|20101222152049.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If I may - I want to 
20101222152049.000|20101222152052.000|TR0|see and feel more security during the  
20101222152052.000|20101222152054.000|TR0|holiday travel?  Are you giving us this in 
20101222152054.000|20101222152056.000|TR0|part to give them a heads up about  that 
20101222152056.000|20101222152058.000|TR0|and give an explanation why?
20101222152058.000|20101222152100.000|TR0|
20101222152100.000|20101222152103.000|TR0|GIBBS:  No, I think you guys over blew 
20101222152103.000|20101222152105.000|TR0|that when we did that at Thanksgiving.  So 
20101222152105.000|20101222152107.000|TR0|I think that's sort of taken cared of.  I 
20101222152107.000|20101222152109.000|TR0|think we wanted to give a sense, I think 
20101222152109.000|20101222152111.000|TR0|importantly of what has - what has been 
20101222152111.000|20101222152114.000|TR0|done as a result of what John mentioned 
20101222152114.000|20101222152116.000|TR0|last year as a failure in our security and 
20101222152116.000|20101222152118.000|TR0|intelligence apparatus relating to the 
20101222152118.000|20101222152120.000|TR0|attempted bombing on Christmas day.
20101222152120.000|20101222152122.000|TR0|
20101222152122.000|20101222152125.000|TR0|I think it's important for the American 
20101222152125.000|20101222152127.000|TR0|people to understand that as John said we 
20101222152127.000|20101222152129.000|TR0|take the threat enormously seriously.  
20101222152129.000|20101222152131.000|TR0|There is a huge part of our government 
20101222152131.000|20101222152133.000|TR0|that is focused on those threats and on 
20101222152133.000|20101222152136.000|TR0|their security.  We wanted those to be 
20101222152136.000|20101222152138.000|TR0|aware of the steps that have been taken in 
20101222152138.000|20101222152140.000|TR0|the intervening weeks and months to 
20101222152140.000|20101222152142.000|TR0|address them.

20101222152144.000|20101222152147.000|TR0|I do not anticipate that people  will see 
20101222152147.000|20101222152149.000|TR0|or feel an increase in or an inconvenience 
20101222152149.000|20101222152151.000|TR0|in their travel plans.  But suffice it to 
20101222152151.000|20101222152153.000|TR0|say, we are taking all the necessary steps 
20101222152153.000|20101222152155.000|TR0|and measures across not just air travel, 
20101222152155.000|20101222152158.000|TR0|but other modes of  transportation.

20101222152217.000|20101222152220.000|TR0|GIBBS:  I don't want to talk about

20101222152222.000|20101222152224.000|TR0|look  at - look at intelligence and 
20101222152224.000|20101222152226.000|TR0|reporting across.  As I said many 
20101222152226.000|20101222152228.000|TR0|different modes  of transportation.  And 
20101222152228.000|20101222152230.000|TR0|many different, are aware of and acting on

20101222152244.000|20101222152246.000|TR0|at this time.  So -

20101222152248.000|20101222152250.000|TR0|GIBBS:  Again, we are going to take 
20101222152250.000|20101222152252.000|TR0|whatever steps and actions are necessary 
20101222152252.000|20101222152255.000|TR0|to insure a heightened sense of 
20101222152255.000|20101222152257.000|TR0|protection.  Yes, sir?
20101222152257.000|20101222152259.000|TR0|
20101222152259.000|20101222152301.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Maybe my recollection 
20101222152301.000|20101222152303.000|TR0|is wrong but isn't it true that aside from 
20101222152303.000|20101222152306.000|TR0|the underwear bombing attempt last 
20101222152306.000|20101222152308.000|TR0|Christmas day, we in Washington, 
20101222152308.000|20101222152310.000|TR0|(INAUDIBLE) get breathless each holiday 
20101222152310.000|20101222152312.000|TR0|time about increased security?
20101222152312.000|20101222152314.000|TR0|
20101222152314.000|20101222152317.000|TR0|GIBBS:  I don't know that your 
20101222152317.000|20101222152319.000|TR0|breathlessness is limited simply to 
20101222152319.000|20101222152321.000|TR0|holidays observed on a calendar but -
20101222152321.000|20101222152323.000|TR0|
20101222152323.000|20101222152325.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  These are - the 
20101222152325.000|20101222152328.000|TR0|attempted attacks have been random it  
20101222152328.000|20101222152330.000|TR0|seems.
20101222152330.000|20101222152332.000|TR0|
20101222152332.000|20101222152334.000|TR0|GIBBS:  I think that John would probably 
20101222152334.000|20101222152336.000|TR0|tell you there is quite frankly a little 
20101222152336.000|20101222152339.000|TR0|bit of both.  Look, obviously, you have 
20101222152339.000|20101222152341.000|TR0|around the holiday season whether  it's - 
20101222152341.000|20101222152343.000|TR0|whether it's Thanksgiving or whether it's 
20101222152343.000|20101222152345.000|TR0|around Christmas.  You have - you know, 
20101222152345.000|20101222152347.000|TR0|you have a huge increase in just the 
20101222152347.000|20101222152350.000|TR0|volume of those that are moving around.  
20101222152350.000|20101222152352.000|TR0|You have, as you mentioned, at other 
20101222152352.000|20101222152354.000|TR0|times, you know  Times Square, or  the 
20101222152354.000|20101222152356.000|TR0|AQAP plot involving cargo planes, which is 
20101222152356.000|20101222152358.000|TR0|not, as you mentioned, not affixed 
20101222152358.000|20101222152401.000|TR0|necessarily to a holiday.
20101222152401.000|20101222152403.000|TR0|
20101222152403.000|20101222152405.000|TR0|So that's why I think one of the points 
20101222152405.000|20101222152407.000|TR0|that John wanted to make was regardless of 
20101222152407.000|20101222152409.000|TR0|the day on the calendar, there's a 
20101222152409.000|20101222152412.000|TR0|vigilance  that must be maintained around  
20101222152412.000|20101222152414.000|TR0|the clock in order to insure that we are 
20101222152414.000|20101222152416.000|TR0|doing al that we possibly can and taking 
20101222152416.000|20101222152418.000|TR0|the steps that are necessary to rightly 
20101222152418.000|20101222152420.000|TR0|protect the American people and to inform 
20101222152420.000|20101222152422.000|TR0|them of threats that might be had outside 
20101222152422.000|20101222152425.000|TR0|of the homeland.  So again, this was 
20101222152425.000|20101222152427.000|TR0|largely an informational briefing on 
20101222152427.000|20101222152429.000|TR0|John's part to give you a sense of what 
20101222152429.000|20101222152431.000|TR0|we're doing.  Ben?
20101222152431.000|20101222152433.000|TR0|
20101222152433.000|20101222152436.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have a question 
20101222152436.000|20101222152438.000|TR0|about the signing ceremony on "don't ask  
20101222152438.000|20101222152440.000|TR0|don't tell," I'm struck by the president 
20101222152440.000|20101222152442.000|TR0|saying at the top that he was overwhelmed 
20101222152442.000|20101222152444.000|TR0|and obviously, there was a lot of emotions 
20101222152444.000|20101222152447.000|TR0|in that ceremony.  (INAUDIBLE) for many 
20101222152447.000|20101222152449.000|TR0|years, is that one of the more emotional 
20101222152449.000|20101222152451.000|TR0|times you have seen him (INAUDIBLE) in 
20101222152451.000|20101222152453.000|TR0|that way.
20101222152453.000|20101222152455.000|TR0|
20101222152455.000|20101222152458.000|TR0|GIBBS:  I think watching it on television 
20101222152458.000|20101222152500.000|TR0|as well as I was not there.  I wish I 
20101222152500.000|20101222152502.000|TR0|would have been.  But I think the - this 
20101222152502.000|20101222152504.000|TR0|is something that the president has  
20101222152504.000|20101222152506.000|TR0|fought long and hard for and believe is 
20101222152506.000|20101222152509.000|TR0|needed to be done for many years.  Again, 
20101222152509.000|20101222152511.000|TR0|when I started working for him in April of 
20101222152511.000|20101222152513.000|TR0|2004, and as part of his campaign for the 
20101222152513.000|20101222152515.000|TR0|U.S. Senate, he had pledged to vote for 
20101222152515.000|20101222152517.000|TR0|the repeal of this  policy because he 
20101222152517.000|20101222152520.000|TR0|thought it was wrong.
20101222152520.000|20101222152522.000|TR0|
20101222152522.000|20101222152524.000|TR0|I think today represents the beginning of 
20101222152524.000|20101222152526.000|TR0|a process that ends that policy.  The 
20101222152526.000|20101222152528.000|TR0|president has occasion to speak with 
20101222152528.000|20101222152531.000|TR0|Admiral Mullen and several of the joint 
20101222152531.000|20101222152533.000|TR0|chiefs yesterday.  To discuss what is now 
20101222152533.000|20101222152535.000|TR0|being implemented in terms of a  working 
20101222152535.000|20101222152537.000|TR0|group to - that will lead to the 
20101222152537.000|20101222152539.000|TR0|certification by the Secretary of Defense, 
20101222152539.000|20101222152542.000|TR0|the chair of the Joint Chiefs and the 
20101222152542.000|20101222152544.000|TR0|president that the policy is  officially 
20101222152544.000|20101222152546.000|TR0|ended.
20101222152546.000|20101222152548.000|TR0|
20101222152548.000|20101222152550.000|TR0|The president's belief in discussing with 
20101222152550.000|20101222152553.000|TR0|the chiefs is  that this is a matter of 
20101222152553.000|20101222152555.000|TR0|months, and he looks forward to that 
20101222152555.000|20101222152557.000|TR0|happening.  I do think it was - I do think 
20101222152557.000|20101222152559.000|TR0|this was one of - this is an 
20101222152559.000|20101222152601.000|TR0|accomplishment that he is enormously proud 
20101222152601.000|20101222152604.000|TR0|of and happy  that it was one that was not 
20101222152604.000|20101222152606.000|TR0| just the - not just the work of one party 
20101222152606.000|20101222152608.000|TR0|but by those across party lines that 
20101222152608.000|20101222152610.000|TR0|believed that the policy was wrong. Didn't 
20101222152610.000|20101222152612.000|TR0|make any sense for national security and 
20101222152612.000|20101222152614.000|TR0|is now in the process of being ended.
20101222152614.000|20101222152617.000|TR0|
20101222152617.000|20101222152619.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just one other on 
20101222152619.000|20101222152621.000|TR0|that.  Some of the advocates who have  
20101222152621.000|20101222152623.000|TR0|fought for this for so long see this as an 
20101222152623.000|20101222152625.000|TR0|opening as greater justice for their 
20101222152625.000|20101222152628.000|TR0|cause.  Do you see that as well?  The way 
20101222152628.000|20101222152630.000|TR0|I see this is the country is ready for 
20101222152630.000|20101222152632.000|TR0|more equality on this front?
20101222152632.000|20101222152634.000|TR0|
20101222152634.000|20101222152636.000|TR0|GIBBS:  I will say this.  I think whether 
20101222152636.000|20101222152639.000|TR0|you look at the attitudal study that was 
20101222152639.000|20101222152641.000|TR0|done at the Pentagon or you look at any 
20101222152641.000|20101222152643.000|TR0|assortment of public polling conducted by 
20101222152643.000|20101222152645.000|TR0|many of your news organizations I think it 
20101222152645.000|20101222152647.000|TR0|is clear to see that the attitudes of - 
20101222152647.000|20101222152650.000|TR0|the attitudes of Americans about who 
20101222152650.000|20101222152652.000|TR0|should or who could serve in the military 
20101222152652.000|20101222152654.000|TR0|has clearly changed over the course of the 
20101222152654.000|20101222152656.000|TR0|past several years.  What that leads to in 
20101222152656.000|20101222152658.000|TR0|the future, I think is harder to tell. 
20101222152658.000|20101222152701.000|TR0|Because some of this stuff obviously has 
20101222152701.000|20101222152703.000|TR0|to go through a divided Congress.  Yes

20101222152822.000|20101222152824.000|TR0|
20101222152824.000|20101222152826.000|TR0|And in New York, Spiderman in the new 
20101222152826.000|20101222152828.000|TR0|Broadway show wasn't quite able to pull 
20101222152828.000|20101222152831.000|TR0|off his characteristic moves.  The 
20101222152831.000|20101222152833.000|TR0|stuntman fell 20 to 30 feet from the stage 
20101222152833.000|20101222152835.000|TR0|Monday.  He is hospitalized in serious 
20101222152835.000|20101222152837.000|TR0|condition, we're told.  An actor's union 
20101222152837.000|20101222152839.000|TR0|blames the fall on human error and says 
20101222152839.000|20101222152842.000|TR0|it's working with other agencies to create 
20101222152842.000|20101222152844.000|TR0|a safety plan to address the issue.
20101222152844.000|20101222152846.000|TR0|
20101222152846.000|20101222152848.000|TR0|And it's official.  President Obama signed 
20101222152848.000|20101222152850.000|TR0|the repeal of "don't ask don't tell" into 
20101222152850.000|20101222152853.000|TR0|law.  After a 17-year ban, the president's 
20101222152853.000|20101222152855.000|TR0|signature means gay men and lesbians will 
20101222152855.000|20101222152857.000|TR0|be able to openly serve in the military.  
20101222152857.000|20101222152859.000|TR0|But you won't see the changes right away.  
20101222152859.000|20101222152901.000|TR0|The White House says it will take several 
20101222152901.000|20101222152904.000|TR0|months to actually implement the law.
20101222152904.000|20101222152906.000|TR0|
20101222152906.000|20101222152908.000|TR0|The White House invited our next two 
20101222152908.000|20101222152910.000|TR0|guests to attend the signing because the 
20101222152910.000|20101222152912.000|TR0|repeal will literally change their lives.
20101222152912.000|20101222152915.000|TR0|
20101222152915.000|20101222152917.000|TR0|Major Margaret Whit, a decorated flight 
20101222152917.000|20101222152919.000|TR0|nurse who was dismissed from the military 
20101222152919.000|20101222152921.000|TR0|under that policy.  And also joining her 
20101222152921.000|20101222152923.000|TR0|is Lieutenant Colonel Victor Fehrenbach, a 
20101222152923.000|20101222152926.000|TR0|decorated fighter pilot who also faced the 
20101222152926.000|20101222152928.000|TR0|end of his career because of the ban.  
20101222152928.000|20101222152930.000|TR0|They're both joining me now live from the 
20101222152930.000|20101222152932.000|TR0|Washington bureau.  Great to have you both.
20101222152932.000|20101222152934.000|TR0|
20101222152934.000|20101222152937.000|TR0|Victor, we have been talking for such a 
20101222152937.000|20101222152939.000|TR0|long time about this.  I finally get to 
20101222152939.000|20101222152941.000|TR0|meet your inspiration, Margie.  But Victor 
20101222152941.000|20101222152943.000|TR0|let's start with you.  What did it feel 
20101222152943.000|20101222152945.000|TR0|like in the room?  I have never seen the 
20101222152945.000|20101222152947.000|TR0|Department of Interior so full of cheers 
20101222152947.000|20101222152950.000|TR0|and screams from the audience.
20101222152950.000|20101222152952.000|TR0|
20101222152952.000|20101222152954.000|TR0|LT. COL. VICTOR FEHRENBACH, U.S. AIR 
20101222152954.000|20101222152956.000|TR0|FORCE:  It was overwhelming. From the two 
20101222152956.000|20101222152958.000|TR0|weeks ago the Senate vote that failed, 
20101222152958.000|20101222153001.000|TR0|where I had really lost faith and hope.  I 
20101222153001.000|20101222153003.000|TR0|did not expect this day to come.  And then 
20101222153003.000|20101222153005.000|TR0|finally, to be in the Senate chamber on 
20101222153005.000|20101222153007.000|TR0|Friday, that is the most emotional day I 
20101222153007.000|20101222153009.000|TR0|had.  I was overcome there.
20101222153009.000|20101222153012.000|TR0|
20101222153012.000|20101222153014.000|TR0|And today, it has been several days where 
20101222153014.000|20101222153016.000|TR0|it's been almost surreal that this is 
20101222153016.000|20101222153018.000|TR0|really happening.  And finally to see the 
20101222153018.000|20101222153020.000|TR0|president today to put ink to paper and 
20101222153020.000|20101222153023.000|TR0|sign this into law, it has been a 
20101222153023.000|20101222153025.000|TR0|tremendous day.  It made it real for me 
20101222153025.000|20101222153027.000|TR0|and for tens of thousands of others that 
20101222153027.000|20101222153029.000|TR0|are currently serving.
20101222153029.000|20101222153031.000|TR0|
20101222153031.000|20101222153034.000|TR0|And I'll just add that he made a promise 
20101222153034.000|20101222153036.000|TR0|to me a year-and-a-half ago.  He looked me 
20101222153036.000|20101222153038.000|TR0|in the eye and said, "I'm going to get 
20101222153038.000|20101222153040.000|TR0|this done." There were times over that 
20101222153040.000|20101222153042.000|TR0|two-and-a-half years that I doubted that, 
20101222153042.000|20101222153045.000|TR0|but it looks like today the president 
20101222153045.000|20101222153047.000|TR0|always believed it.  He did get this done. 
20101222153047.000|20101222153049.000|TR0| He signed the bill, and he pounded his 
20101222153049.000|20101222153051.000|TR0|fist on top of it, and said, "This is 
20101222153051.000|20101222153053.000|TR0|done."
20101222153053.000|20101222153056.000|TR0|
20101222153056.000|20101222153058.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:   And what's interesting is we 
20101222153058.000|20101222153100.000|TR0|have known you through the years as being 
20101222153100.000|20101222153102.000|TR0|a very confident and strong advocate for 
20101222153102.000|20101222153104.000|TR0|repealing "don't ask, don't tell."  But 
20101222153104.000|20101222153107.000|TR0|what a lot of us didn't know is the woman 
20101222153107.000|20101222153109.000|TR0|sitting right next to you was your 
20101222153109.000|20101222153111.000|TR0|inspiration.  Tell us why.
20101222153111.000|20101222153113.000|TR0|
20101222153113.000|20101222153115.000|TR0|FEHRENBACH:  Well, she really was.  This 
20101222153115.000|20101222153118.000|TR0|-- my ordeal started in May 2008.  For 
20101222153118.000|20101222153120.000|TR0|anyone who has ever had to go through this 
20101222153120.000|20101222153122.000|TR0|law and had this affect their lives, they 
20101222153122.000|20101222153124.000|TR0|know what that can do to you.  And that 
20101222153124.000|20101222153126.000|TR0|first week, I was crushed.  I mean, I 
20101222153126.000|20101222153129.000|TR0|wanted to quit.  I wanted to give up.  Not 
20101222153129.000|20101222153131.000|TR0|just on my career - I didn't want anyone 
20101222153131.000|20101222153133.000|TR0|to know about this -- there were times 
20101222153133.000|20101222153135.000|TR0|when I thought I was going give up on life.
20101222153135.000|20101222153137.000|TR0|
20101222153137.000|20101222153139.000|TR0|And someone told me about a week after 
20101222153139.000|20101222153142.000|TR0|that told me that there was an Air Force 
20101222153142.000|20101222153144.000|TR0|major up in Washington State who had just 
20101222153144.000|20101222153146.000|TR0|won a case. She had beaten "don't ask, 
20101222153146.000|20101222153148.000|TR0|don't tell" and has been continuing to 
20101222153148.000|20101222153150.000|TR0|fight for several years, and I needed to 
20101222153150.000|20101222153153.000|TR0|read about her case.  That it might affect 
20101222153153.000|20101222153155.000|TR0|me.
20101222153155.000|20101222153157.000|TR0|
20101222153157.000|20101222153159.000|TR0|And I did.  I read about the case and I 
20101222153159.000|20101222153201.000|TR0|started to look it up on the Internet.  
20101222153201.000|20101222153204.000|TR0|And that was the first glimmer of hope 
20101222153204.000|20101222153206.000|TR0|that I had that someone could speak out.  
20101222153206.000|20101222153208.000|TR0|Someone could fight and win.  So, Margie 
20101222153208.000|20101222153210.000|TR0|has been an inspiration to me.  From the 
20101222153210.000|20101222153212.000|TR0|first day, our cases have been intertwined.
20101222153212.000|20101222153215.000|TR0|
20101222153215.000|20101222153217.000|TR0|Other leaders, like "Grethe" Cammermeyer, 
20101222153217.000|20101222153219.000|TR0|obviously, she has been an inspiration for 
20101222153219.000|20101222153221.000|TR0|millions of people for over 20 years now.  
20101222153221.000|20101222153223.000|TR0|And just others that have spoken out.  
20101222153223.000|20101222153226.000|TR0|There was no way I could speak out if 
20101222153226.000|20101222153228.000|TR0|there were not people who came before me 
20101222153228.000|20101222153230.000|TR0|to lay the groundwork, and Margie was one 
20101222153230.000|20101222153232.000|TR0|of those people.
20101222153232.000|20101222153234.000|TR0|
20101222153234.000|20101222153237.000|TR0|PHILLIPS: And Margie, why did you decide 
20101222153237.000|20101222153239.000|TR0|to fight this battle so hard and so 
20101222153239.000|20101222153241.000|TR0|publicly?
20101222153241.000|20101222153243.000|TR0|
20101222153243.000|20101222153245.000|TR0|MAJOR MARGIE WITT, U.S. AIR FORCE:  Well, 
20101222153245.000|20101222153248.000|TR0|like Victor said, I think -- because I had 
20101222153248.000|20101222153250.000|TR0|the opportunity to do it, for one thing.  
20101222153250.000|20101222153252.000|TR0|Not everybody can really be capable of 
20101222153252.000|20101222153254.000|TR0|doing that.  I had many people that were 
20101222153254.000|20101222153256.000|TR0|willing to help me.
20101222153256.000|20101222153259.000|TR0|
20101222153259.000|20101222153301.000|TR0|But because of people like "Grethe" 
20101222153301.000|20101222153303.000|TR0|Cammermeyer, who came before, there are so 
20101222153303.000|20101222153305.000|TR0|many folks that have come before and 
20101222153305.000|20101222153307.000|TR0|really showed courage and strength and, 
20101222153307.000|20101222153310.000|TR0|you know, honor.
20101222153310.000|20101222153312.000|TR0|
20101222153312.000|20101222153314.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And Margie, we have heard 
20101222153314.000|20101222153316.000|TR0|Victor's story many a times. He was outed 
20101222153316.000|20101222153318.000|TR0|by another party. And that was really, 
20101222153318.000|20101222153321.000|TR0|really tough because he had such a great 
20101222153321.000|20101222153323.000|TR0|relationship with his squadron and 
20101222153323.000|20101222153325.000|TR0|everybody with whom he worked.
20101222153325.000|20101222153327.000|TR0|
20101222153327.000|20101222153329.000|TR0|Take us back to how that happened for you. 
20101222153329.000|20101222153331.000|TR0| Is that something that you think about, 
20101222153331.000|20101222153334.000|TR0|like that moment when it happened and how 
20101222153334.000|20101222153336.000|TR0|devastating it was for you?
20101222153336.000|20101222153338.000|TR0|
20101222153338.000|20101222153340.000|TR0|WITT:  Oh, absolutely.  It was a 
20101222153340.000|20101222153342.000|TR0|devastating day in my life.  I think I 
20101222153342.000|20101222153345.000|TR0|probably felt a lot of the same emotions 
20101222153345.000|20101222153347.000|TR0|that Victor did. Came as a complete 
20101222153347.000|20101222153349.000|TR0|surprise to me.  I had not told anyone  I 
20101222153349.000|20101222153351.000|TR0|had been serving what I thought under 
20101222153351.000|20101222153353.000|TR0|"don't ask, don't tell" in the proper 
20101222153353.000|20101222153356.000|TR0|manner.  So, it was quite a surprise.
20101222153356.000|20101222153358.000|TR0|
20101222153358.000|20101222153400.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  How did it happen?
20101222153400.000|20101222153402.000|TR0|
20101222153402.000|20101222153404.000|TR0|WITT:  My commander came and got me and 
20101222153404.000|20101222153407.000|TR0|walked me down a hall to a conference room 
20101222153407.000|20101222153409.000|TR0|and said there was somebody that wanted to 
20101222153409.000|20101222153411.000|TR0|speak to me.  I thought it was about 
20101222153411.000|20101222153413.000|TR0|something else that was going on on base. 
20101222153413.000|20101222153415.000|TR0|I stepped into the room, and she closed 
20101222153415.000|20101222153418.000|TR0|the door and he introduced himself as a 
20101222153418.000|20101222153420.000|TR0|JAG and said what's your relationship with 
20101222153420.000|20101222153422.000|TR0|this individual?  And I was absolutely 
20101222153422.000|20101222153424.000|TR0|shocked.
20101222153424.000|20101222153426.000|TR0|
20101222153426.000|20101222153429.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And Margie, do you think it's 
20101222153429.000|20101222153431.000|TR0|been harder for gay men or gay women 
20101222153431.000|20101222153433.000|TR0|dealing with this policy?  Or do you think 
20101222153433.000|20101222153435.000|TR0|it's definitely been an equal struggle?  
20101222153435.000|20101222153437.000|TR0|Because I'm sure there's differences, 
20101222153437.000|20101222153440.000|TR0|right?  for both men and women?
20101222153440.000|20101222153442.000|TR0|
20101222153442.000|20101222153444.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20101222153444.000|20101222153446.000|TR0|
20101222153446.000|20101222153448.000|TR0|WITT:  Of course there's differences.  You 
20101222153448.000|20101222153451.000|TR0|know, I think it does depend on the 
20101222153451.000|20101222153453.000|TR0|individual.  There are more women, 
20101222153453.000|20101222153455.000|TR0|however, that have been discharged under 
20101222153455.000|20101222153457.000|TR0|this policy because of being -- having it 
20101222153457.000|20101222153459.000|TR0|used against them in many circumstances 
20101222153459.000|20101222153502.000|TR0|when advances were refused and things like 
20101222153502.000|20101222153504.000|TR0|that.  I think many of us experienced that.
20101222153504.000|20101222153506.000|TR0|
20101222153506.000|20101222153508.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Finally, and Victor, I will let 
20101222153508.000|20101222153510.000|TR0|you answer this -- there is obviously an 
20101222153510.000|20101222153513.000|TR0|overwhelming amount of support to repeal 
20101222153513.000|20101222153515.000|TR0|this policy.  But of course there are 
20101222153515.000|20101222153517.000|TR0|still critics out there.  And you know, 
20101222153517.000|20101222153519.000|TR0|last time we talked, we talked about the 
20101222153519.000|20101222153521.000|TR0|survey that was done -- led to try to 
20101222153521.000|20101222153523.000|TR0|implement how this would work and how 
20101222153523.000|20101222153526.000|TR0|would you deal with those critics and 
20101222153526.000|20101222153528.000|TR0|those that are against homosexuality in 
20101222153528.000|20101222153530.000|TR0|the military.  The chaplains being very 
20101222153530.000|20101222153532.000|TR0|vocal about that, as we both know.
20101222153532.000|20101222153534.000|TR0|
20101222153534.000|20101222153537.000|TR0|And I am thinking of the one quote that 
20101222153537.000|20101222153539.000|TR0|came through.  A Marine was quoted in that 
20101222153539.000|20101222153541.000|TR0|survey that done talking about the comfort 
20101222153541.000|20101222153543.000|TR0|level. He had said, "I cannot rely on 
20101222153543.000|20101222153545.000|TR0|someone on whom I do not feel comfortable 
20101222153545.000|20101222153548.000|TR0|with, nor can they trust me.  A lack of 
20101222153548.000|20101222153550.000|TR0|trust turns into a lack of cohesion, which 
20101222153550.000|20101222153552.000|TR0|eventually leads to mission failure."
20101222153552.000|20101222153554.000|TR0|
20101222153554.000|20101222153556.000|TR0|What do you say to those men and women who 
20101222153556.000|20101222153559.000|TR0|are still struggling with this change?
20101222153559.000|20101222153601.000|TR0|
20101222153601.000|20101222153603.000|TR0|FEHRENBACH:  Just from my personal 
20101222153603.000|20101222153605.000|TR0|experience, I found that once you know 
20101222153605.000|20101222153607.000|TR0|someone who is gay and you fight alongside 
20101222153607.000|20101222153610.000|TR0|them and you go to combat and you bleed 
20101222153610.000|20101222153612.000|TR0|and cry with them when you see your 
20101222153612.000|20101222153614.000|TR0|friends may die or get injured in combat 
20101222153614.000|20101222153616.000|TR0|-- once you go war with someone and you 
20101222153616.000|20101222153618.000|TR0|form this bond.  And that bond goes beyond 
20101222153618.000|20101222153621.000|TR0|any kind of race, gender, sexual 
20101222153621.000|20101222153623.000|TR0|orientation, religion.
20101222153623.000|20101222153625.000|TR0|
20101222153625.000|20101222153627.000|TR0|I mean, we all have people we are not 
20101222153627.000|20101222153629.000|TR0|comfortable with that we don't want to 
20101222153629.000|20101222153632.000|TR0|work with or fly in combat with everyday.  
20101222153632.000|20101222153634.000|TR0|But you know what?  The difference is when 
20101222153634.000|20101222153636.000|TR0|you put on the uniform, there may be 
20101222153636.000|20101222153638.000|TR0|somebody I don't like or I don't want to 
20101222153638.000|20101222153640.000|TR0|go to war with, but at the end of the day 
20101222153640.000|20101222153643.000|TR0|because they want to serve their country 
20101222153643.000|20101222153645.000|TR0|and they believe in the same values that I 
20101222153645.000|20101222153647.000|TR0|do, I would jump in front of a bullet for 
20101222153647.000|20101222153649.000|TR0|that person.
20101222153649.000|20101222153651.000|TR0|
20101222153651.000|20101222153654.000|TR0|And that's all we care about. Again, we 
20101222153654.000|20101222153656.000|TR0|are disciplined.  We are dedicated to the 
20101222153656.000|20101222153658.000|TR0|mission, and we love our country and we 
20101222153658.000|20101222153700.000|TR0|just want to serve.  And those are the 
20101222153700.000|20101222153702.000|TR0|people that need to be serving in the 
20101222153702.000|20101222153705.000|TR0|military today. This is a great day.
20101222153705.000|20101222153707.000|TR0|
20101222153707.000|20101222153709.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, and I know that Margie 
20101222153709.000|20101222153711.000|TR0|feels the same way. Major Margaret Witt 
20101222153711.000|20101222153713.000|TR0|and Lieutenant Colonel Victor Fehrenbach.  
20101222153713.000|20101222153715.000|TR0|Didn't know how long this was going to 
20101222153715.000|20101222153718.000|TR0|take, but we are finally talking about 
20101222153718.000|20101222153720.000|TR0|what we are talking about for a number of 
20101222153720.000|20101222153722.000|TR0|years.  And the energy and smiles on your 
20101222153722.000|20101222153724.000|TR0|faces says a lot.
20101222153724.000|20101222153726.000|TR0|
20101222153726.000|20101222153729.000|TR0|Thank you so much to both of you for being 
20101222153729.000|20101222153731.000|TR0|with me today.
20101222153731.000|20101222153733.000|TR0|
20101222153733.000|20101222153735.000|TR0|FEHRENBACH:  Thanks, Kyra.  Merry 
20101222153735.000|20101222153737.000|TR0|Christmas.
20101222153737.000|20101222153740.000|TR0|
20101222153740.000|20101222153742.000|TR0|WITT:  Thanks, Kyra.  Thanks very much.

20101222153748.000|20101222153751.000|TR0|Breaking news right now.  Want to show you 
20101222153751.000|20101222153753.000|TR0|live pictures.  This is coming from our 
20101222153753.000|20101222153755.000|TR0|affiliate WCVB.  We're being told that one 
20101222153755.000|20101222153757.000|TR0|person has been killed in a small plane 
20101222153757.000|20101222153759.000|TR0|crash at a central Massachusetts airport.  
20101222153759.000|20101222153802.000|TR0|This is according to the FAA.  Apparently 
20101222153802.000|20101222153804.000|TR0|the crash happened there at Spencer 
20101222153804.000|20101222153806.000|TR0|Airport, which is located about five miles 
20101222153806.000|20101222153808.000|TR0|west of Worcester.  It's not immediately 
20101222153808.000|20101222153810.000|TR0|clear what kind of plane was involved.  As 
20101222153810.000|20101222153813.000|TR0|soon as we get more information, we will 
20101222153813.000|20101222153815.000|TR0|bring it to you.

20101222153817.000|20101222153819.000|TR0|(AUDIO GAP) -- a news conference out of 
20101222153819.000|20101222153821.000|TR0|Chicago, Illinois, we are being told in 
20101222153821.000|20101222153824.000|TR0|just a few minutes.  Is this still a live 
20101222153824.000|20101222153826.000|TR0|picture, guys? This is the tape.
20101222153826.000|20101222153828.000|TR0|
20101222153828.000|20101222153830.000|TR0|All right.  This is video from about 45 
20101222153830.000|20101222153832.000|TR0|minutes ago.  We don't have a live picture 
20101222153832.000|20101222153835.000|TR0|at this point.  But firefighters were 
20101222153835.000|20101222153837.000|TR0|desperately trying to rescue two of their 
20101222153837.000|20101222153839.000|TR0|own after four had become trapped in an 
20101222153839.000|20101222153841.000|TR0|abandoned building that had collapsed 
20101222153841.000|20101222153843.000|TR0|after a fire.
20101222153843.000|20101222153846.000|TR0|
20101222153846.000|20101222153848.000|TR0|It happened this morning, about 7:00 a.m. 
20101222153848.000|20101222153850.000|TR0|this morning.  The four firefighters were 
20101222153850.000|20101222153852.000|TR0|trapped under a brick wall that had 
20101222153852.000|20101222153854.000|TR0|collapsed.  Two were rescued, rushed to 
20101222153854.000|20101222153857.000|TR0|the hospital.  Those firefighters still 
20101222153857.000|20101222153859.000|TR0|trying to figure out where the other two 
20101222153859.000|20101222153901.000|TR0|are, digging feverishly there in the 
20101222153901.000|20101222153903.000|TR0|rubble.  We hope to know more in the news 
20101222153903.000|20101222153905.000|TR0|conference coming up in a just couple of 
20101222153905.000|20101222153907.000|TR0|minutes.  We will take it live.

20101222153921.000|20101222153923.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  There is nothing quite like a 
20101222153923.000|20101222153925.000|TR0|kid's smile on Christmas, unwrapping gifts 
20101222153925.000|20101222153927.000|TR0|from Santa and loved ones.  But there are 
20101222153927.000|20101222153929.000|TR0|thousands of kids out there who might have

20101222154016.000|20101222154018.000|TR0|FELLOWSHIT:  The headlines referred to me 
20101222154018.000|20101222154020.000|TR0|primarily as the Bonnie Parker of Alabama. 
20101222154020.000|20101222154022.000|TR0|And my specialty was a double barrel 
20101222154022.000|20101222154024.000|TR0|sawed-off shotgun, which I carried in a

20101222154029.000|20101222154031.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Mary Kay Beard was known as a 
20101222154031.000|20101222154033.000|TR0|safe cracker, a gun packing bank robber 
20101222154033.000|20101222154035.000|TR0|who made the FBI's ten most wanted list.  
20101222154035.000|20101222154038.000|TR0|She was arrested in 1972, and while 
20101222154038.000|20101222154040.000|TR0|serving time, she noticed her fellow 
20101222154040.000|20101222154042.000|TR0|inmates, especially the women with 
20101222154042.000|20101222154044.000|TR0|children saved, sorted, and traded most 
20101222154044.000|20101222154046.000|TR0|donations they received.

20101222154049.000|20101222154051.000|TR0|BEARD:  As I looked at the women, I 
20101222154051.000|20101222154053.000|TR0|realized the number of piles they had 
20101222154053.000|20101222154055.000|TR0|organized corresponded with the number of 
20101222154055.000|20101222154057.000|TR0|children they had, and that's what they 
20101222154057.000|20101222154059.000|TR0|planned to give their own children at 
20101222154059.000|20101222154102.000|TR0|Christmastime.

20101222154115.000|20101222154117.000|TR0|that it was the children that we need to

20101222154150.000|20101222154152.000|TR0|possible to still be a part of her life.

20101222154223.000|20101222154225.000|TR0|something which I couldn't do.  They're 
20101222154225.000|20101222154227.000|TR0|helping me out.  I couldn't be there in

20101222154256.000|20101222154258.000|TR0|of drug abuse and dozens of arrests.  He

20101222154302.000|20101222154305.000|TR0|it right.  They spoke just once a year

20101222154335.000|20101222154338.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  So, Christopher, let me ask 
20101222154338.000|20101222154340.000|TR0|you, just seeing what your father has gone 
20101222154340.000|20101222154342.000|TR0|through in this struggle but having this 
20101222154342.000|20101222154344.000|TR0|sort of new chance to build a 
20101222154344.000|20101222154346.000|TR0|relationship, what has that taught you as 
20101222154346.000|20101222154349.000|TR0|a young man about drugs and drug abuse?  
20101222154349.000|20101222154351.000|TR0|My guess is you are not only a big 
20101222154351.000|20101222154353.000|TR0|advocate for Dad, but also a big advocate 
20101222154353.000|20101222154355.000|TR0|for kids not to even get near drugs of any 
20101222154355.000|20101222154357.000|TR0|kind.
20101222154357.000|20101222154400.000|TR0|
20101222154400.000|20101222154402.000|TR0|C CLEVELAND JR.: Well, seeing firsthand 
20101222154402.000|20101222154404.000|TR0|how drugs had affected my dad's life 
20101222154404.000|20101222154406.000|TR0|really made me not want to get involved 
20101222154406.000|20101222154408.000|TR0|with drugs.  So, I stay as far away from 
20101222154408.000|20101222154411.000|TR0|drugs as possible that I can.  So, yes.
20101222154411.000|20101222154413.000|TR0|
20101222154413.000|20101222154415.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  yes.  And dad, that's got to be 
20101222154415.000|20101222154417.000|TR0|music to your ears. That's probably the 
20101222154417.000|20101222154419.000|TR0|best thing you could ever hear from a son 
20101222154419.000|20101222154422.000|TR0|you want to turn out so perfectly yes?

20101222154439.000|20101222154441.000|TR0|it like?  I know it was a real struggle 
20101222154441.000|20101222154443.000|TR0|for you to kick the habit and to stop 
20101222154443.000|20101222154446.000|TR0|dealing.  How did it get so bad?  And at 
20101222154446.000|20101222154448.000|TR0|what point did you realize that I have got 
20101222154448.000|20101222154450.000|TR0|to clean up?  And I've got a son that I've 
20101222154450.000|20101222154452.000|TR0|got to be a role model for?

20101222154454.000|20101222154457.000|TR0|CHRIS CLEVELAND:  You know, Kyra, I was.  
20101222154457.000|20101222154459.000|TR0|I was doing really bad. And it got to a 
20101222154459.000|20101222154501.000|TR0|point to where I realized that the chances 
20101222154501.000|20101222154503.000|TR0|of me having a relationship with my son 
20101222154503.000|20101222154505.000|TR0|were coming close to an end, and so I knew 
20101222154505.000|20101222154508.000|TR0|that I needed to do something.  And it was 
20101222154508.000|20101222154510.000|TR0|God that really changed my life.       
20101222154510.000|20101222154512.000|TR0|PHILLIPS: And Christopher, you know, how 
20101222154512.000|20101222154514.000|TR0|did you forgive Dad? How did you learn to 
20101222154514.000|20101222154516.000|TR0|love him and be close to him after so many 
20101222154516.000|20101222154519.000|TR0|years of not having him around?
20101222154519.000|20101222154521.000|TR0|
20101222154521.000|20101222154523.000|TR0|C. CLEVELAND, JR.:  He was around every 
20101222154523.000|20101222154525.000|TR0|once in a while, and I still saw him as my 
20101222154525.000|20101222154527.000|TR0|father figure because I didn't really know 
20101222154527.000|20101222154530.000|TR0|what was going on.  But as soon as I came 
20101222154530.000|20101222154532.000|TR0|back to live with my dad, he started to 
20101222154532.000|20101222154534.000|TR0|show me the ways of the Bible and how I 
20101222154534.000|20101222154536.000|TR0|should forgive. After we started talking 
20101222154536.000|20101222154538.000|TR0|about things like that, I really started 
20101222154538.000|20101222154541.000|TR0|to forgive him.
20101222154541.000|20101222154543.000|TR0|
20101222154543.000|20101222154545.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  What do you love so much about 
20101222154545.000|20101222154547.000|TR0|your dad now?
20101222154547.000|20101222154549.000|TR0|
20101222154549.000|20101222154552.000|TR0|C.  CLEVELAND, JR.:  That he is 
20101222154552.000|20101222154554.000|TR0|responsible, and I can trust him to go out 
20101222154554.000|20101222154556.000|TR0|and not do what he used to do.
20101222154556.000|20101222154558.000|TR0|
20101222154558.000|20101222154600.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20101222154600.000|20101222154603.000|TR0|
20101222154603.000|20101222154605.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  I like that.  Chris, you laugh. 
20101222154605.000|20101222154607.000|TR0| Tell me why you chuckle.
20101222154607.000|20101222154609.000|TR0|
20101222154609.000|20101222154611.000|TR0|CHRIS CLEVELAND:  Well, it's -- it just -- 
20101222154611.000|20101222154614.000|TR0|you know, I recall some of the things that 
20101222154614.000|20101222154616.000|TR0|I used to do, and I think back now to 
20101222154616.000|20101222154618.000|TR0|current events and how abundant my life is 
20101222154618.000|20101222154620.000|TR0|since God changed me.  And the things that 
20101222154620.000|20101222154622.000|TR0|we do together is just incredible.  So, 
20101222154622.000|20101222154625.000|TR0|the life, more abundant.
20101222154625.000|20101222154627.000|TR0|
20101222154627.000|20101222154629.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Let's talk about that.  The two 
20101222154629.000|20101222154631.000|TR0|of you now working together within the 
20101222154631.000|20101222154633.000|TR0|Angel Tree project.  What a fabulous thing 
20101222154633.000|20101222154635.000|TR0|to do as a father and son.
20101222154635.000|20101222154638.000|TR0|
20101222154638.000|20101222154640.000|TR0|Chris, why do you do it?  And how has it 
20101222154640.000|20101222154642.000|TR0|helped not only other kids who have been 
20101222154642.000|20101222154644.000|TR0|through what Christopher has been through 
20101222154644.000|20101222154646.000|TR0|but what does it do for the two of you and 
20101222154646.000|20101222154649.000|TR0|your relationship and your hearts?
20101222154649.000|20101222154651.000|TR0|
20101222154651.000|20101222154653.000|TR0|CHRIS CLEVELAND:  Every year when we start 
20101222154653.000|20101222154655.000|TR0|the process of putting the angels on the 
20101222154655.000|20101222154657.000|TR0|tree, watching the process go, I know 
20101222154657.000|20101222154700.000|TR0|exactly from the other side how long and 
20101222154700.000|20101222154702.000|TR0|what it really takes to put all of this 
20101222154702.000|20101222154704.000|TR0|together.  So, bringing it all together 
20101222154704.000|20101222154706.000|TR0|and doing the bag and sort where we get to 
20101222154706.000|20101222154708.000|TR0|be interactive together with other people 
20101222154708.000|20101222154711.000|TR0|in the church.  And it really just is a 
20101222154711.000|20101222154713.000|TR0|great time together.
20101222154713.000|20101222154715.000|TR0|
20101222154715.000|20101222154717.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  And Christopher, how about for 
20101222154717.000|20101222154719.000|TR0|you?  You know?  Is it -- do you have 
20101222154719.000|20101222154722.000|TR0|advice for the other kids?  Do you get a 
20101222154722.000|20101222154724.000|TR0|chance to talk to them and say, hey, hang 
20101222154724.000|20101222154726.000|TR0|in there?  Look at my dad and me?  It 
20101222154726.000|20101222154728.000|TR0|could get better?
20101222154728.000|20101222154730.000|TR0|
20101222154730.000|20101222154733.000|TR0|C. CLEVELAND, JR.:  You know, as what he 
20101222154733.000|20101222154735.000|TR0|said, seeing from the other side, I know 
20101222154735.000|20101222154737.000|TR0|how it felt as those kids.  So, when I go 
20101222154737.000|20101222154739.000|TR0|and bring them their gifts and I see their 
20101222154739.000|20101222154741.000|TR0|smile, it just brings a lot --
20101222154741.000|20101222154744.000|TR0|
20101222154744.000|20101222154746.000|TR0|CHRIS CLEVELAND:  A lot of joy.
20101222154746.000|20101222154748.000|TR0|

20101222154752.000|20101222154755.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  How about seeing your dad right 
20101222154755.000|20101222154757.000|TR0|next to you? Not only being one of your 
20101222154757.000|20101222154759.000|TR0|best friends but giving back together?  
20101222154759.000|20101222154801.000|TR0|What's that like?
20101222154801.000|20101222154803.000|TR0|
20101222154803.000|20101222154806.000|TR0|C. CLEVELAND, JR.:  I never would have 
20101222154806.000|20101222154808.000|TR0|thought that me and my dad would have been 
20101222154808.000|20101222154810.000|TR0|able to do anything like that because of 
20101222154810.000|20101222154812.000|TR0|how both of our pasts were.  And now that 
20101222154812.000|20101222154814.000|TR0|we get to do things like this, it's just 
20101222154814.000|20101222154817.000|TR0|such a blessing to do it.
20101222154817.000|20101222154819.000|TR0|
20101222154819.000|20101222154821.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  It's pretty awesome to see what

20101222154832.000|20101222154834.000|TR0|C. CLEVELAND, JR.:  No, it's a basketball.
20101222154834.000|20101222154836.000|TR0|

20101222154845.000|20101222154847.000|TR0|were watching history being made now.

20101222155055.000|20101222155057.000|TR0|vagrants that may be in there. And that's 
20101222155057.000|20101222155059.000|TR0|what the companies were doing when the 
20101222155059.000|20101222155101.000|TR0|roof let loose.
20101222155101.000|20101222155103.000|TR0|
20101222155103.000|20101222155106.000|TR0|QUESTION: Do you have any notion as to the 
20101222155106.000|20101222155108.000|TR0|nature of the fire (OFF-MIKE).
20101222155108.000|20101222155110.000|TR0|
20101222155110.000|20101222155112.000|TR0|LANGFORD:  Not at this time.  We are 
20101222155112.000|20101222155114.000|TR0|investigating now due to the condition we 
20101222155114.000|20101222155117.000|TR0|have now.  We had a pile of bricks.  It 
20101222155117.000|20101222155119.000|TR0|was a flat, ordinary constructed roof in 
20101222155119.000|20101222155121.000|TR0|the front and a bullstring (ph) truss in 
20101222155121.000|20101222155123.000|TR0|the back.
20101222155123.000|20101222155125.000|TR0|
20101222155125.000|20101222155128.000|TR0|QUESTION: So, the building was abandoned?
20101222155128.000|20101222155130.000|TR0|
20101222155130.000|20101222155132.000|TR0|LANGFORD:  Was apparently abandoned.  We 
20101222155132.000|20101222155134.000|TR0|do know that for a fact because it was 
20101222155134.000|20101222155136.000|TR0|boarded up, but the back end was open.  
20101222155136.000|20101222155139.000|TR0|That's why we assume somebody may have 
20101222155139.000|20101222155141.000|TR0|been in there that was sleeping in there 
20101222155141.000|20101222155143.000|TR0|or something.  That's why we went in to do 
20101222155143.000|20101222155145.000|TR0|the search, and the fire was in the 
20101222155145.000|20101222155147.000|TR0|northeast corner of the building.
20101222155147.000|20101222155150.000|TR0|
20101222155150.000|20101222155152.000|TR0|QUESTION: Commissioner, can you describe 
20101222155152.000|20101222155154.000|TR0|the rescue attempt to us?
20101222155154.000|20101222155156.000|TR0|
20101222155156.000|20101222155158.000|TR0|LANGFORD:  Hard and fast.  The companies 
20101222155158.000|20101222155201.000|TR0|were - I mean, the Red (ph) company went 
20101222155201.000|20101222155203.000|TR0|to work right away.  They removed -- I 
20101222155203.000|20101222155205.000|TR0|couldn't tell you each and every spot, but 
20101222155205.000|20101222155207.000|TR0|firefighters were removed from different 
20101222155207.000|20101222155209.000|TR0|corners of the building.  They worked hard 
20101222155209.000|20101222155211.000|TR0|and they got them out fast.
20101222155211.000|20101222155214.000|TR0|
20101222155214.000|20101222155216.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We will get back to 
20101222155216.000|20101222155218.000|TR0|you guys later on with more details so the 
20101222155218.000|20101222155220.000|TR0|commissioner can get to the hospital and 
20101222155220.000|20101222155222.000|TR0|check on the guys.  We'll have some more 
20101222155222.000|20101222155225.000|TR0|later on.
20101222155225.000|20101222155227.000|TR0|

20101222155231.000|20101222155233.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Unfortunately, we missed the 
20101222155233.000|20101222155236.000|TR0|first part of that news conference, trying 
20101222155236.000|20101222155238.000|TR0|to get confirmation from the folks in the 
20101222155238.000|20101222155240.000|TR0|newsroom.
20101222155240.000|20101222155242.000|TR0|
20101222155242.000|20101222155244.000|TR0|OK.  So, several firefighters, we are 
20101222155244.000|20101222155247.000|TR0|being told, were rescued after this 
20101222155247.000|20101222155249.000|TR0|building collapsed.  We were told early on 
20101222155249.000|20101222155251.000|TR0|that two were still trapped under a brick 
20101222155251.000|20101222155253.000|TR0|wall that came down on top of them.
20101222155253.000|20101222155255.000|TR0|
20101222155255.000|20101222155258.000|TR0|Can we confirm whether those firefighters 
20101222155258.000|20101222155300.000|TR0|are still searching for two of their own?  
20101222155300.000|20101222155302.000|TR0|OK, 12 firefighters taken to the hospital? 
20101222155302.000|20101222155304.000|TR0| OK. So, 12 firefighters taken to the 
20101222155304.000|20101222155306.000|TR0|hospital.  Do we know, Carrie, if they are 
20101222155306.000|20101222155309.000|TR0|still searching for fellow firefighters as 
20101222155309.000|20101222155311.000|TR0|we were told earlier on?
20101222155311.000|20101222155313.000|TR0|
20101222155313.000|20101222155315.000|TR0|They are not.  Ok, no longer searching 
20101222155315.000|20101222155317.000|TR0|then.  Do we know if there are -- if they 
20101222155317.000|20101222155320.000|TR0|believe that any firefighters are trapped 
20101222155320.000|20101222155322.000|TR0|still under that rubble?
20101222155322.000|20101222155324.000|TR0|
20101222155324.000|20101222155326.000|TR0|OK.  We are being told that all have been 
20101222155326.000|20101222155328.000|TR0|accounted for.  This is according to WGN's 
20101222155328.000|20101222155331.000|TR0|Web site, actually.  They are one of our 
20101222155331.000|20101222155333.000|TR0|affiliates in Chicago that has been on the 
20101222155333.000|20101222155335.000|TR0|story from the very beginning.  We were 
20101222155335.000|20101222155337.000|TR0|told possibly they were searching for two 
20101222155337.000|20101222155339.000|TR0|of their own, but apparently all the 
20101222155339.000|20101222155342.000|TR0|firefighters have been accounted for.  
20101222155342.000|20101222155344.000|TR0|That is great news.
20101222155344.000|20101222155346.000|TR0|
20101222155346.000|20101222155348.000|TR0|And the ones that have been rescued, the 
20101222155348.000|20101222155350.000|TR0|12 that have been rescued, are being 
20101222155350.000|20101222155353.000|TR0|treated at local hospitals.  As you heard 
20101222155353.000|20101222155355.000|TR0|right there from that news conference, 
20101222155355.000|20101222155357.000|TR0|possibly the chief or one of the captains 
20101222155357.000|20101222155359.000|TR0|there headed to the hospitals to check on 
20101222155359.000|20101222155401.000|TR0|his firefighters to see what their 
20101222155401.000|20101222155403.000|TR0|conditions are.
20101222155403.000|20101222155406.000|TR0|
20101222155406.000|20101222155408.000|TR0|We will stay on top of this and keep you 
20101222155408.000|20101222155410.000|TR0|updated on the conditions of those 12 
20101222155410.000|20101222155412.000|TR0|firefighters that were rescued after that 
20101222155412.000|20101222155414.000|TR0|abandoned building caught fire and 
20101222155414.000|20101222155417.000|TR0|collapsed and caught fire this morning in

20101222155428.000|20101222155430.000|TR0|expected to sign into law the most 
20101222155430.000|20101222155432.000|TR0|sweeping overhaul of U.S. food safety in 
20101222155432.000|20101222155434.000|TR0|more than 72 years. Senior medical 
20101222155434.000|20101222155436.000|TR0|correspondent Elizabeth here with our

20101222155445.000|20101222155447.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  The president is 
20101222155447.000|20101222155450.000|TR0|expected to sign it.
20101222155450.000|20101222155452.000|TR0|
20101222155452.000|20101222155454.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  There we go. What does this 
20101222155454.000|20101222155456.000|TR0|mean for you and me, then?
20101222155456.000|20101222155458.000|TR0|
20101222155458.000|20101222155501.000|TR0|COHEN:  You know what?  I think when most 
20101222155501.000|20101222155503.000|TR0|people hear this, they're going to say, 
20101222155503.000|20101222155505.000|TR0|well, duh! Why didn't they do this a long 
20101222155505.000|20101222155507.000|TR0|time ago?  Because some of these things 
20101222155507.000|20101222155509.000|TR0|are so obvious.
20101222155509.000|20101222155512.000|TR0|
20101222155512.000|20101222155514.000|TR0|Let me talk about two big things that this 
20101222155514.000|20101222155516.000|TR0|law does.  This law makes it so the Food 
20101222155516.000|20101222155518.000|TR0|and Drug Administration can recall tainted 
20101222155518.000|20101222155520.000|TR0|foods.
20101222155520.000|20101222155523.000|TR0|
20101222155523.000|20101222155525.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Hello?  That should have 
20101222155525.000|20101222155527.000|TR0|happened a long time ago.
20101222155527.000|20101222155529.000|TR0|
20101222155529.000|20101222155531.000|TR0|COHEN:  Right, because now they have to 
20101222155531.000|20101222155534.000|TR0|ask the company, "Will you please recall 
20101222155534.000|20101222155536.000|TR0|it?".  Now, they won't have to do that 
20101222155536.000|20101222155538.000|TR0|anymore.
20101222155538.000|20101222155540.000|TR0|
20101222155540.000|20101222155542.000|TR0|Also, it introduces a food tracing system. 
20101222155542.000|20101222155545.000|TR0| So, when food gets somebody sick or kills 
20101222155545.000|20101222155547.000|TR0|them, they can trace it back to see where 
20101222155547.000|20101222155549.000|TR0|it came from.  Because right now, let's 
20101222155549.000|20101222155551.000|TR0|say a hamburger kills somebody, they have 
20101222155551.000|20101222155553.000|TR0|no idea where that cow is and where the 
20101222155553.000|20101222155555.000|TR0|rest of that meat is.  Those are two of 
20101222155555.000|20101222155558.000|TR0|the big changes.
20101222155558.000|20101222155600.000|TR0|
20101222155600.000|20101222155602.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  And also, HHS 
20101222155602.000|20101222155604.000|TR0|secretary Kathleen Sebeilius making this 
20101222155604.000|20101222155606.000|TR0|proposal that would make health insurance 
20101222155606.000|20101222155609.000|TR0|companies justify premium hikes?
20101222155609.000|20101222155611.000|TR0|
20101222155611.000|20101222155613.000|TR0|COHEN:  Exactly.  If an insurance company 
20101222155613.000|20101222155615.000|TR0|hikes your rates more than 10 percent, 
20101222155615.000|20101222155617.000|TR0|this proposal means that the federal 
20101222155617.000|20101222155620.000|TR0|government would automatically review it.  
20101222155620.000|20101222155622.000|TR0|Because sometimes those rate increases may 
20101222155622.000|20101222155624.000|TR0|be justified, but often, they are not.  
20101222155624.000|20101222155626.000|TR0|So, the feds would review it and say 
20101222155626.000|20101222155628.000|TR0|whether or not it is okay.
20101222155628.000|20101222155631.000|TR0|
20101222155631.000|20101222155633.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  OK.  And finally, the third 
20101222155633.000|20101222155635.000|TR0|thing we should be talking about?  
20101222155635.000|20101222155637.000|TR0|C-sections?       COHEN:  Right. 
20101222155637.000|20101222155639.000|TR0|C-sections.
20101222155639.000|20101222155642.000|TR0|
20101222155642.000|20101222155644.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  On the rise.
20101222155644.000|20101222155646.000|TR0|
20101222155646.000|20101222155648.000|TR0|COHEN:  On the rise again.  We tell this 
20101222155648.000|20101222155650.000|TR0|story every year.
20101222155650.000|20101222155653.000|TR0|
20101222155653.000|20101222155655.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Well, I'm going to be one of 
20101222155655.000|20101222155657.000|TR0|the.  There you go.  With twins on the way 
20101222155657.000|20101222155659.000|TR0|--
20101222155659.000|20101222155701.000|TR0|
20101222155701.000|20101222155704.000|TR0|COHEN:  There is a high likelihood.
20101222155704.000|20101222155706.000|TR0|
20101222155706.000|20101222155708.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, exactly.
20101222155708.000|20101222155710.000|TR0|
20101222155710.000|20101222155712.000|TR0|COHEN:  That's right.  So, C-section rates 
20101222155712.000|20101222155715.000|TR0|went up yet again. So, right now, one out 
20101222155715.000|20101222155717.000|TR0|of every three babies - actually, I 
20101222155717.000|20101222155719.000|TR0|shouldn't say right now. When - for the 
20101222155719.000|20101222155721.000|TR0|statistics, 2009, C-sections.  One out of 
20101222155721.000|20101222155723.000|TR0|every three babies born in 2009 were 
20101222155723.000|20101222155726.000|TR0|delivered by C-section.  That was the 
20101222155726.000|20101222155728.000|TR0|highest number ever.  And those rates have 
20101222155728.000|20101222155730.000|TR0|gone up 60 percent since 1996.  So, up 60 
20101222155730.000|20101222155732.000|TR0|percent in 13 years.
20101222155732.000|20101222155734.000|TR0|
20101222155734.000|20101222155737.000|TR0|I think the message here, you know what?  
20101222155737.000|20101222155739.000|TR0|Some ladies want a C- section.
20101222155739.000|20101222155741.000|TR0|
20101222155741.000|20101222155743.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Yes, I was just going to ask 
20101222155743.000|20101222155745.000|TR0|you, why is it on the rise?  Is it because 
20101222155745.000|20101222155747.000|TR0|of IVF and women are having multiples?  
20101222155747.000|20101222155750.000|TR0|So, that increases it, right?
20101222155750.000|20101222155752.000|TR0|
20101222155752.000|20101222155754.000|TR0|COHEN:  That's part of it. Women are 
20101222155754.000|20101222155756.000|TR0|having babies older, which increases the 
20101222155756.000|20101222155758.000|TR0|chance you'll have a C-section.  I have 
20101222155758.000|20101222155801.000|TR0|asked doctors this, and I say, is this 
20101222155801.000|20101222155803.000|TR0|sort of the professional ladies in their 
20101222155803.000|20101222155805.000|TR0|suits saying darn it, I want my C-section? 
20101222155805.000|20101222155807.000|TR0|Give it to me --
20101222155807.000|20101222155809.000|TR0|
20101222155809.000|20101222155812.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  We like to stay on a schedule!
20101222155812.000|20101222155814.000|TR0|
20101222155814.000|20101222155816.000|TR0|COHEN:  Right!  Exactly!  I'm free on June 
20101222155816.000|20101222155818.000|TR0|15.
20101222155818.000|20101222155820.000|TR0|
20101222155820.000|20101222155823.000|TR0|That's part of it.  But they said, really 
20101222155823.000|20101222155825.000|TR0|what it is is doctors don't like lawsuits. 
20101222155825.000|20101222155827.000|TR0| And so, it used to be if they are in the 
20101222155827.000|20101222155829.000|TR0|delivery room and things are looking a 
20101222155829.000|20101222155831.000|TR0|little bit like they are headed to a 
20101222155831.000|20101222155834.000|TR0|C-section, they would try really hard to 
20101222155834.000|20101222155836.000|TR0|get that vaginal delivery.  But they said 
20101222155836.000|20101222155838.000|TR0|these days, they are much more likely to 
20101222155838.000|20101222155840.000|TR0|go and do that C-section.
20101222155840.000|20101222155842.000|TR0|
20101222155842.000|20101222155845.000|TR0|And so, the Empowered Patient message is, 
20101222155845.000|20101222155847.000|TR0|if you do not want a C- section, choose a 
20101222155847.000|20101222155849.000|TR0|doctor at the very beginning or a midwife 
20101222155849.000|20101222155851.000|TR0|who is committed to vaginal deliveries.  
20101222155851.000|20101222155853.000|TR0|And you can interview them and ask them 
20101222155853.000|20101222155856.000|TR0|their C-section rate and what not.  But 
20101222155856.000|20101222155858.000|TR0|you need to know that from the get-go.  
20101222155858.000|20101222155900.000|TR0|How committed are you to me having a 
20101222155900.000|20101222155902.000|TR0|vaginal delivery?
20101222155902.000|20101222155904.000|TR0|
20101222155904.000|20101222155907.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  Elizabeth, thanks.

20101222155913.000|20101222155915.000|TR0|PHILLIPS:  All right.  Well, that does it 
20101222155915.000|20101222155918.000|TR0|for us.  We hope you have a great rest of
