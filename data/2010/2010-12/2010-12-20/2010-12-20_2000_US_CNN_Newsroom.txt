20101220202042.159|20101220202044.962|CC1|>> I POINTED TO THE COMMANDER OF

20101220202045.529|20101220202048.032|CC1|I SAID, NOW, HERE IS ONE OF THE
20101220202048.165|20101220202049.633|CC1|BRAVEST MEN EVER IN THE HISTORY
20101220202049.767|20101220202051.368|CC1|OF THIS COUNTRY TO DON OUR

20101220202054.972|20101220202058.475|CC1|I'VE EVER MET.
20101220202058.609|20101220202101.812|CC1|AND THEY STARTED LAUGHING AND
20101220202101.945|20101220202102.179|CC1|CHEERING.
20101220202102.312|20101220202104.481|CC1|I SAID, NOW, WHY SHOULD GENERAL
20101220202104.615|20101220202106.283|CC1|SMITH HAVE TO STAY IN THE CLOSET
20101220202106.417|20101220202109.353|CC1|WHEN HE'S SUCH A GREAT LEADER?
20101220202109.486|20101220202110.020|CC1|GENERAL SMITH, STAND UP AND

20101220202111.121|20101220202112.923|CC1|EVERYONE CHEERED.
20101220202113.056|20101220202115.292|CC1|AND THEN THE BLEACHERS, THERE
20101220202115.425|20101220202118.228|CC1|WAS A GROUP OF WOMEN SOLDIERS
20101220202118.362|20101220202120.364|CC1|WHO CHEERED EXTRA LOUD AND WAVED
20101220202120.497|20101220202120.931|CC1|AT HIM.
20101220202121.064|20101220202122.199|CC1|HE WAVED BACK AT THEM.
20101220202122.332|20101220202123.667|CC1|AND AT THE END OF THE SHOW, THE
20101220202123.800|20101220202124.701|CC1|GENERAL CAME UP.
20101220202124.835|20101220202132.075|CC1|AND HE GAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL FRAME
20101220202132.209|20101220202134.878|CC1|WITH AN AMERICAN FLAG THAT HAD
20101220202135.011|20101220202136.746|CC1|FLOWN OVER THE BASE.
20101220202136.880|20101220202141.751|CC1|AND HE GAVE IT TO EVERY MEMBER
20101220202141.885|20101220202143.453|CC1|OF OUR TROUPE.
20101220202143.586|20101220202146.122|CC1|AND WHEN HE GAVE IT TO ME, HE
20101220202146.256|20101220202147.424|CC1|SAID, AL, KEEP TELLING THOSE
20101220202147.557|20101220202150.126|CC1|"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" JOKES.
20101220202150.260|20101220202150.860|CC1|I THINK YOU MAY HAVE SOME FANS
20101220202150.994|20101220202152.996|CC1|UP THERE.
20101220202153.129|20101220202157.333|CC1|AND HE POINTED AT THOSE WOMEN.
20101220202157.467|20101220202200.637|CC1|AND LATER THOSE WOMEN CAME UP TO
20101220202200.770|20101220202210.613|CC1|ME AND SAID, "WE'RE GAY."
20101220202210.747|20101220202212.915|CC1|AND I MEAN, THEY'RE -- I -- I
20101220202213.049|20101220202215.918|CC1|THINK EVERYBODY KNEW IT.
20101220202216.052|20101220202217.854|CC1|>> I THINK EVERYONE KNEW IT.
20101220202217.987|20101220202219.088|CC1|YOU HEARD HIM.
20101220202219.222|20101220202223.693|CC1|WOULD HE PERHAPS, LEO, BE

20101220202224.894|20101220202227.029|CC1|AND LESS BANS INTO THE MILITARY
20101220202227.163|20101220202228.965|CC1|MAYBE NOT AS TRAUMATIC AS SOME
20101220202229.098|20101220202229.398|CC1|MAY THINK?
20101220202229.532|20101220202231.200|CC1|>> THAT'S BEEN THE ARGUMENT OF
20101220202231.334|20101220202236.705|CC1|REPEAL OPPONENW PROPONENTS ALL T
20101220202236.839|20101220202237.773|CC1|FOLKS KNOW INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR

20101220202240.042|20101220202240.843|CC1|ALONGSIDE THEM AND HASN'T BEEN
20101220202240.976|20101220202242.378|CC1|MUCH OF AN ISSUE.
20101220202242.511|20101220202244.413|CC1|WE KNOW SOCIETAL TRENDS HAVE

20101220202245.981|20101220202246.582|CC1|AS WELL.
20101220202246.715|20101220202248.217|CC1|THE OTHER SIDE WOULD ARGUE THAT
20101220202248.350|20101220202249.618|CC1|IT WILL BE DIFFERENT ONES FOLKS

20101220202251.987|20101220202253.289|CC1|ONCE THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG
20101220202253.422|20101220202254.423|CC1|AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO SERVE
20101220202254.556|20101220202256.458|CC1|AND ACTUALLY HAVE TO CONFRONT
20101220202256.592|20101220202257.693|CC1|SOME OF THOSE ISSUES.
20101220202257.826|20101220202259.995|CC1|GO FINALLY, I GUESS, JUST FROM

20101220202307.169|20101220202308.237|CC1|>> IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHO YOU
20101220202308.370|20101220202308.871|CC1|HAVE ASK.
20101220202309.004|20101220202311.440|CC1|FROM OUR STORIES, WE HEARD

20101220202322.751|20101220202323.685|CC1|BUT THE PENTAGON REPORTS SHOWED
20101220202323.819|20101220202326.121|CC1|THAT UP TO A THIRD OF TROOPS

20101220203446.157|20101220203446.991|CC1|THESE ISSUES.
20101220203447.125|20101220203450.028|CC1|>> I'M ALSO CURIOUS -- WE TALK
20101220203450.161|20101220203451.062|CC1|ABOUT SMALL TOWNS AND THE FACT
20101220203451.195|20101220203452.196|CC1|THIS HAPPENED IN A SMALL TOWN
20101220203452.330|20101220203454.265|CC1|AND THE JUDGE HAD TO RECUSE
20101220203454.398|20101220203455.299|CC1|HIMSELF BECAUSE HE KNOWS ONE OF
20101220203455.433|20101220203456.801|CC1|THE FAMILIES.
20101220203456.934|20101220203458.302|CC1|EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE.
20101220203458.436|20101220203500.037|CC1|IS THAT, SCOTT, A PROBLEM IN
20101220203500.171|20101220203500.938|CC1|THIS PARTICULAR CASE?
20101220203501.072|20101220203502.707|CC1|>> WELL, I'M NOT AWARE OF THE
20101220203502.840|20101220203504.909|CC1|REASONS WHY THE JUDGE RECUSED
20101220203505.042|20101220203505.343|CC1|HIMSELF.
20101220203505.476|20101220203507.845|CC1|BUT IN A SMALL TOWN, I THINK
20101220203507.979|20101220203508.980|CC1|IT'S DIFFICULT.
20101220203509.113|20101220203510.681|CC1|THIS IS NOT JUST A SMALL TOWN

20101220203514.952|20101220203515.619|CC1|AND BULLYING.
20101220203515.753|20101220203517.755|CC1|BUT IN A SMALL TOWN OF 11,000,
20101220203517.888|20101220203519.924|CC1|YES, I THINK PEOPLE ARE MORE

20101220203521.892|20101220203524.295|CC1|ARE GOING ON AND IT'S MORE
20101220203524.428|20101220203525.329|CC1|DIFFICULT IN OUR AREA.
20101220203525.462|20101220203527.398|CC1|>> WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT
20101220203527.531|20101220203530.200|CC1|GIVEN THESE ALLEGATIONS, YOU

20101220203537.341|20101220203538.909|CC1|DOES THAT GO BEYOND HAZING TO
20101220203539.042|20101220203539.176|CC1|YOU?
20101220203539.309|20101220203540.878|CC1|>> LIKE I SAID BEFORE, I'M NOT

20101220205918.303|20101220205924.008|CC1|HE SAID, SURE.
20101220205924.142|20101220205925.410|CC1|HE THOUGHT IT WAS A STEP FORWARD
20101220205925.543|20101220205926.744|CC1|IN GAY RIGHTS.
20101220205926.878|20101220205930.014|CC1|THIS QUESTION WAS PUT TO THE

20101220205946.998|20101220205948.566|CC1|I IMAGINE WHAT THE PRESIDENT
20101220205948.699|20101220205950.801|CC1|WOULD LIKE TO DO IS REPEAL THE

20101220210042.485|20101220210043.420|CC1|AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS FEELING
