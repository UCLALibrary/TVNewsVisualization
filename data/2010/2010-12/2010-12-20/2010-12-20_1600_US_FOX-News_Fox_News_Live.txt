20101220160933.865|20101220160935.100|CC1|>> I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A
20101220160935.100|20101220160936.601|CC1|NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS TO

20101220160946.644|20101220160947.712|CC1|THEY'VE CHANGED THE AMOUNT
20101220160947.712|20101220160949.681|CC1|AND REDUCED IT TO 6 BILLION,
20101220160949.681|20101220160950.815|CC1|INSTEAD OF 7 BILLION, AND

20101220160952.750|20101220160954.752|CC1|FUND OF LAST RESORT, MEANING
20101220160954.752|20101220160955.787|CC1|A FIRST RESPONDER WOULD HAVE
20101220160955.787|20101220160956.788|CC1|TO EXHAUST THEIR INSURANCE
20101220160956.788|20101220160958.723|CC1|AND THEIR WORKERS' COMP AND
20101220160958.723|20101220160959.757|CC1|EVERYTHING ELSE BEFORE THEY

20101220161006.497|20101220161007.932|CC1|>> THIS HAS AN MOVING TARGET
20101220161007.932|20101220161008.933|CC1|FROM DAY ONE.
20101220161008.933|20101220161010.368|CC1|UNDERSTAND, THIS IS NOT A
20101220161010.368|20101220161011.569|CC1|BILL THAT WAS CONSIDERED BY
20101220161011.569|20101220161013.871|CC1|A COMMITTEE OF THE CONGRESS,
20101220161013.871|20101220161015.273|CC1|AND FIXED SO THAT WHEN IT

20101220161016.474|20101220161018.009|CC1|THE MAIN ISSUES WERE
20101220161018.009|20101220161018.442|CC1|RESOLVED.
20101220161018.442|20101220161019.277|CC1|THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY
20101220161019.277|20101220161021.412|CC1|CAME UP WITH TO JUST PUT
20101220161021.412|20101220161022.647|CC1|DIRECTLY ON THE FLOOR OF THE

20101220161029.787|20101220161031.155|CC1|THEY THEN HAVE BEEN CHANGING

20101220161052.309|20101220161053.777|CC1|I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS
20101220161053.777|20101220161054.845|CC1|THING WOULD WORK, HOW THE
20101220161054.845|20101220161056.613|CC1|FUND IS SET UP, SO THEY'VE

20101220161059.116|20101220161100.417|CC1|FROM 7 BILLION TO 6 BILLION,
20101220161100.417|20101220161101.818|CC1|I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER
20101220161101.818|20101220161102.819|CC1|6 BILLION IS A REASONABLE
20101220161102.819|20101220161103.453|CC1|FIGURE.  THERE WAS ALREADY

20101220162601.237|20101220162602.504|CC1|GIVEN THE ISSUES HE'S FACING
20101220162602.504|20101220162603.906|CC1|HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GOVERN
20101220162603.906|20101220162605.074|CC1|IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY.
20101220162605.074|20101220162607.376|CC1|FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, HE'S
20101220162607.376|20101220162609.712|CC1|HEMMED IN ON SPENDING BY THE
20101220162609.712|20101220162611.280|CC1|PUBLIC'S OBVIOUS DESIRE THAT
20101220162611.280|20101220162612.681|CC1|SPENDING BE CURBED AND
20101220162612.681|20101220162615.217|CC1|CURBED SHARPLY, EVEN INDEED
20101220162615.217|20101220162615.717|CC1|REDUCED.
20101220162615.717|20101220162617.619|CC1|THAT ISN'T GOING TO SIT WELL
20101220162617.619|20101220162618.921|CC1|AMONG DEMOCRATS WHO BELIEVE
20101220162618.921|20101220162620.422|CC1|THAT GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS
20101220162620.422|20101220162621.690|CC1|POSITIVELY GOOD IN MOST
20101220162621.690|20101220162622.057|CC1|CASES.
20101220162622.057|20101220162623.458|CC1|BUT HE WILL NEED TO DO THAT
20101220162623.458|20101220162624.760|CC1|TO SATISFY THE PUBLIC'S
20101220162624.760|20101220162626.128|CC1|DEMAND THAT THE BUDGET
20101220162626.128|20101220162627.295|CC1|DECIFIT BE BROUGHT UNDER
20101220162627.295|20101220162628.196|CC1|CONTROL THAT.  WILL
20101220162628.196|20101220162629.164|CC1|NATURALLY DRIVE HIM INTO THE
20101220162629.164|20101220162630.599|CC1|ARMS OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE
20101220162630.599|20101220162632.134|CC1|SIMILARLY INCLINED.
20101220162632.134|20101220162634.035|CC1|I THINK THE TAX ISSUE,
20101220162634.035|20101220162635.303|CC1|RAISING TAXES TO DEAL WITH

20101220162637.906|20101220162639.107|CC1|YEARS, SO THAT'S NOT AN
20101220162639.107|20101220162640.375|CC1|AVENUE HE'LL BE ABLE TO
20101220162640.375|20101220162641.509|CC1|PURSUE AND THAT WILL KEEP
20101220162641.509|20101220162643.345|CC1|HIM AWAY FROM THAT ISSUE.
20101220162643.345|20101220162644.379|CC1|ANOTHER ISSUE, OF COURSE, IS
20101220162644.379|20101220162645.580|CC1|THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN,
20101220162645.580|20101220162647.248|CC1|WHERE HE CAN'T REALLY COUNT
20101220162647.248|20101220162648.717|CC1|ON HIS OWN PARTY TO THE
20101220162648.717|20101220162650.218|CC1|EXTENT HE HAS, HE'LL NEED

20101220171844.749|20101220171844.749|CC1|ADVAIR helps significantly

20101220171847.385|20101220171849.254|CC1|While nothing can reverse COPD,
20101220171849.254|20101220171849.254|CC1|ADVAIR is different from most

20101220171851.990|20101220171851.990|CC1|because it contains
20101220171851.990|20101220171854.326|CC1|both an anti-inflammatory
20101220171854.326|20101220171854.326|CC1|and a long-acting

20101220171858.229|20101220171858.229|CC1|ADVAIR won't replace fast-acting

20101220171901.733|20101220171901.733|CC1|and should not be
