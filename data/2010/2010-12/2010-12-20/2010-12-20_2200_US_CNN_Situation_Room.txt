20101220233310.196|20101220233312.465|CC1|IT SEEMS LIKE A DECEMBER TO
20101220233312.599|20101220233313.333|CC1|REMEMBER TO ME.
20101220233313.466|20101220233315.201|CC1|LET ME JUST SAY THIS ONE THING.
20101220233315.335|20101220233316.870|CC1|THAT IS THEY ALMOST HAD TO GET A
20101220233317.003|20101220233320.073|CC1|DEAL ON THE TAX QUCUT EXTENSION.
20101220233320.206|20101220233321.441|CC1|NOBODY WANTED TO WALK AWAY

20101220233333.920|20101220233334.821|CC1|WASHINGTON WILL ACTUALLY SIT
20101220233334.954|20101220233336.289|CC1|DOWN AND GET SOMETHING DONE.
20101220233336.422|20101220233338.091|CC1|NOW, AS YOU KNOW, THE LIBERALS
20101220233338.224|20101220233339.325|CC1|ARE FURIOUS AT HIM.
20101220233339.459|20101220233340.260|CC1|SOME CONSERVATIVES DON'T LIKE
20101220233340.393|20101220233341.995|CC1|THE TAX CUT.
20101220233342.128|20101220233343.563|CC1|THAT PUTS THE PRESIDENT IN THE
20101220233343.696|20101220233343.897|CC1|MIDDLE.

20101220233346.065|20101220233347.133|CC1|BIG CHALLENGE IS SPENDING CUTS.
20101220233347.267|20101220233348.668|CC1|RIGHT NOW HE'S IN THE MIDDLE,
20101220233348.801|20101220233349.335|CC1|AND THEY LIKE THAT.
20101220233349.469|20101220233351.237|CC1|>> IT TOOK HIM A LOT LESS TIME

20101220233352.839|20101220233354.040|CC1|I THOUGHT, OKAY, WE'LL HAVE TO

20101220233358.278|20101220233400.313|CC1|>> I GUESS THAT'S WHAT -- HE
20101220233400.446|20101220233401.347|CC1|DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME.
20101220233401.481|20101220233402.515|CC1|JANUARY 1, SOMEBODY WAS KNOWING
20101220233402.649|20101220233404.217|CC1|TO BE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG.
20101220233404.350|20101220233405.051|CC1|>> THAT'S RIGHT.
20101220233405.184|20101220233406.519|CC1|THAT WAS HIS RESPONSE TO THE
20101220233406.653|20101220233406.886|CC1|LIBERALS.
20101220233407.020|20101220233408.955|CC1|WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO?
20101220233409.088|20101220233410.423|CC1|WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO LET
20101220233410.556|20101220233412.725|CC1|PEOPLE'S TAXES GO UP SO THAT THE
20101220233412.859|20101220233414.127|CC1|REPUBLICANS CAN GET CRESS FOR

20101220233423.336|20101220233427.240|CC1|BECAUSE OF THE EXPERATIEXPIRATI.
20101220233427.373|20101220233431.410|CC1|IT FORCED HIM TO DO THIS.
20101220233431.544|20101220233433.513|CC1|>> LET ME LOOK AT THE POLITICS
20101220233433.646|20101220233434.013|CC1|OF THIS.
20101220233434.147|20101220233435.248|CC1|THE PRESIDENT MAY HAVE DONE
20101220233435.381|20101220233437.450|CC1|HIMSELF SOME GOOD.
20101220233437.583|20101220233439.018|CC1|TAKE A LOOK AT THE CNN OPINION
20101220233439.152|20101220233439.919|CC1|RESEARCH CORPORATION POLL.
20101220233440.052|20101220233441.921|CC1|HE'S GOT ABOUT A 48% APPROVAL
20101220233442.054|20101220233442.255|CC1|RATING.
20101220233442.388|20101220233443.890|CC1|NOT GREAT, BUT NOT HORRIBLE.
20101220233444.023|20101220233445.491|CC1|BUT LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED
20101220233445.625|20101220233447.026|CC1|SINCE NOVEMBER.
20101220233447.160|20101220233449.729|CC1|LIBERALS, SUPPORT WENT FROM 79%
20101220233449.862|20101220233453.966|CC1|TO 72%.
20101220233454.100|20101220233454.867|CC1|CONSERVATIVES, IT'S A WASH.
20101220233455.001|20101220233455.368|CC1|SAME THING.
20101220233455.501|20101220233457.103|CC1|BUT LOOK AT THE MODERATES.
20101220233457.236|20101220233458.638|CC1|HE'S PICKING UP WITH MODERATES.
20101220233458.771|20101220233500.907|CC1|IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT THIS FROM
20101220233501.040|20101220233502.341|CC1|A PURELY POLITICAL POINT OF
20101220233502.475|20101220233503.843|CC1|VIEW, THE MODERATES ARE WHO
20101220233503.976|20101220233504.477|CC1|DECIDE ELECTIONS.
20101220233504.610|20101220233506.112|CC1|THIS WAS A GOOD MOVE FOR HIM
20101220233506.245|20101220233506.579|CC1|THIS DECEMBER.
20101220233506.712|20101220233508.814|CC1|>> IT'S A STEPPING STONE TOWARD

20101220233511.183|20101220233511.417|CC1|SITUATION.
20101220233511.551|20101220233513.953|CC1|CAN HE SUSTAIN HAVING LIBERALS
20101220233514.086|20101220233515.454|CC1|MAD AT HIM?
20101220233515.588|20101220233516.622|CC1|THAT'S PRETTY GOOD OVERALL.
20101220233516.756|20101220233518.291|CC1|WHEN IT COMES TO TURNING OUT THE
20101220233518.424|20101220233520.092|CC1|VOTE, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY
20101220233520.226|20101220233522.495|CC1|ABOUT THAT UNTIL 2012.
20101220233522.628|20101220233524.830|CC1|IF THE REPUBLICANS JUST GOT FROM
20101220233524.964|20101220233526.799|CC1|40% TO 60%, THAT'S WHAT
20101220233526.932|20101220233528.834|CC1|PRESIDENT HAS TO WORRY ABOUT.
20101220233528.968|20101220233530.269|CC1|HOW DO YOU GET THE INDEPENDENTS
20101220233530.403|20101220233530.770|CC1|BACK?
20101220233530.903|20101220233533.673|CC1|THAT'S THE FIRST BAND-AID HE HAS
20101220233533.806|20101220233535.307|CC1|TO FIX.
20101220233535.441|20101220233538.044|CC1|THEN HE'LL WORRY ABOUT HIS BASE.
20101220233538.177|20101220233539.478|CC1|>> I BET THE SUPPORT WILL GO UP
20101220233539.612|20101220233542.515|CC1|FOR THE LIBERALS AFTER HE SIGNS
20101220233542.648|20101220233543.049|CC1|D

20101220233543.949|20101220233546.085|CC1|WHEN YOU 72% SUPPORT AMONG ANY
20101220233546.218|20101220233549.288|CC1|GROUP, WHY ARE YOU WORRYING
20101220233549.422|20101220233549.822|CC1|ABOUT THEM SO MUCH?
20101220233549.989|20101220233551.090|CC1|>> IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO
20101220233551.223|20101220233553.225|CC1|RUN OUT AND VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY
20101220233553.359|20101220233553.692|CC1|OR SARAH PALIN.
20101220233553.826|20101220233554.060|CC1|>> RIGHT.
20101220233554.193|20101220233555.561|CC1|WE HEAR ALL OF THIS, THE BASE,

20101220233556.629|20101220233557.997|CC1|>> BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT.
20101220233558.130|20101220233559.565|CC1|AFTER THE CENSUS WHEN THE SEATS
20101220233559.698|20101220233600.833|CC1|MOVE AROUND, THE MAP IS GOING TO
20101220233600.966|20101220233602.334|CC1|CHANGE IN A WAY NOT TO THE
20101220233602.468|20101220233603.269|CC1|PRESIDENT'S LIKING.
20101220233603.402|20101220233604.937|CC1|IF THE 2012 ELECTION WERE
