20101220123210.068|20101220123212.103|CC1|EMPHASIZED WAS THAT EVERY FORMER

20101220123231.389|20101220123232.490|CC1|QUESTION IS HOW DO THE RUSSIANS

20101220123309.393|20101220123310.527|CC1|>>  THE WHITE HOUSE HAD BEEN

20101220123312.663|20101220123314.464|CC1|HE DIDN'T SAY YES OR NO.
20101220123314.598|20101220123315.332|CC1|BUT HE DID SAY THEY SHOULD
20101220123315.465|20101220123317.501|CC1|PROBABLY DO THAT IN THE NEXT
20101220123317.634|20101220123318.902|CC1|CONGRESS BECAUSE THIS LAME DUCK
20101220123319.036|20101220123320.103|CC1|SESSION HAS BEEN POISONED.
20101220123320.237|20101220123322.606|CC1|THERE'S VERY LITTLE CHANCE THAT
20101220123322.739|20101220123323.407|CC1|THE DEMOCRATS WILL WAIT UNTIL

20101220123330.180|20101220123330.914|CC1|>> THANKS A LOT.
20101220123331.047|20101220123332.182|CC1|I THOUGHT LINDSAY GRAHAM, IF YOU

20101220130839.084|20101220130839.718|CC1|I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY THIS
20101220130839.852|20101220130841.453|CC1|WAS THEIR PLAN BUT TO YOUR

20101220130857.936|20101220130859.404|CC1|>> SOME DEMOCRATIC REFORMS, THAT
20101220130859.538|20101220130900.172|CC1|COULD BE A GOOD FIT.
20101220130900.305|20101220130901.807|CC1|CAN WE TALK ABOUT EXTENDING

20101220130921.026|20101220130922.661|CC1|>> "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" HAD
20101220130922.794|20101220130923.929|CC1|A VERY GOOD EDITORIAL EITHER

20101220130929.234|20101220130930.602|CC1|THAT'S MORE TRUE IF AN ECONOMY
20101220130930.735|20101220130931.836|CC1|IS CREATING JOBS.
20101220130931.970|20101220130932.704|CC1|OUR ECONOMY STILL IS NOT.
20101220130932.837|20101220130935.840|CC1|I THOUGHT IT WAS GROSSLY UNFAIR
20101220130935.974|20101220130937.041|CC1|FOR VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TO
20101220130937.175|20101220130938.143|CC1|SUGGEST THE REPUBLICANS DIDN'T
20101220130938.276|20101220130939.344|CC1|WANT TO EXTEND BENEFITS FOR
20101220130939.477|20101220130940.578|CC1|PEOPLE THAT ARE JOBS.
20101220130940.712|20101220130941.613|CC1|THAT'S NEVER WHAT THEY SAID.
20101220130941.746|20101220130943.281|CC1|WHAT THEY SAID IS WE'LL EXTEND
20101220130943.414|20101220130944.782|CC1|THEM, WE THINK WE SHOULD BE
20101220130944.916|20101220130946.251|CC1|EXTENDING THEM IF THEY ARE PAID
20101220130946.384|20101220130946.618|CC1|FOR.
20101220130946.751|20101220130947.986|CC1|AND THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN
20101220130948.119|20101220130948.987|CC1|PUBLIC REALLY WANT.
20101220130949.120|20101220130950.655|CC1|I THINK THAT GOING FORWARD SINCE
20101220130950.788|20101220130952.190|CC1|WE HAVE THOSE LONG TERM

20101220144754.868|20101220144756.836|CC1|YET AND I DON'T THINK PROGRESS
20101220144756.903|20101220144759.839|CC1|IS BEING MADE QUICK ENOUGH TO
20101220144759.906|20101220144801.040|CC1|GET THERE.
20101220144801.107|20101220144802.976|CC1|THE COMPETITION IS IMPROVING

20101220144806.512|20101220144808.614|CC1|SO THAT GOAL IS CERTAINLY NOT

20101220144820.026|20101220144821.794|CC1|BUT YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT REALLY
20101220144821.861|20101220144823.195|CC1|THEY DID NOT MAKE A LOT OF
20101220144823.262|20101220144824.163|CC1|PROGRESS DOWN THAT ROAD.

20101220144827.833|20101220144828.100|CC1|EXACTLY.
20101220144828.167|20101220144829.168|CC1|THE PROBLEM WITH THE CHEVY VOLT,
20101220144829.235|20101220144831.303|CC1|IT IS A GREEN CAR, BUT IF NOBODY
20101220144831.370|20101220144832.805|CC1|BUYS IT, YOU'RE STILL NOT A

20101220144834.540|20101220144835.141|CC1|>> Gretchen: AND AT THE SAME
20101220144835.207|20101220144836.609|CC1|TIME, YOU HAVE THE FACT THAT

20101220144845.651|20101220144846.919|CC1|>> WELL, THAT'S JUST PART OF THE

20101220144847.319|20101220144849.254|CC1|IT TELLS ME THAT GAS IS
20101220144849.321|20101220144850.222|CC1|RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AND
20101220144850.289|20101220144851.323|CC1|AMERICANS WANT TO GET A LOT OF

20101220144852.991|20101220144854.159|CC1|THE REAL PROBLEM AS FAR AS THE

20101220144857.863|20101220144859.198|CC1|IS THAT WHAT'S COMING ALONG WITH
20101220144859.264|20101220144902.768|CC1|IT IS ALL OF THE INCENTIVE
20101220144902.834|20101220144903.735|CC1|SPENDING, THE HIGH INVENTORY

20101220144904.703|20101220144908.073|CC1|AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT --

20101220144919.050|20101220144919.818|CC1|THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU MAKE IS
