20101220030945.554|20101220030946.455|CC1|>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT
20101220030946.588|20101220030948.123|CC1|THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS SPOT
20101220030948.256|20101220030950.225|CC1|ON EARTH, THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
20101220030950.359|20101220030951.593|CC1|LET'S SET THE SCENE, DON, FOR
20101220030951.727|20101220030952.160|CC1|OUR VIEWERS.
20101220030952.294|20101220030953.829|CC1|THERE ARE A MILLION NORTH KOREAN
20101220030953.962|20101220030956.598|CC1|TROOPS ALONG THE DEMILITARIZED
20101220030956.732|20101220030956.999|CC1|ZONE.
20101220030957.132|20101220030959.001|CC1|HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SOUTH
20101220030959.134|20101220031000.802|CC1|KOREAN TROOPS EYEBALL TO EYEBALL
20101220031000.936|20101220031002.771|CC1|ON THE SOUTH KOREAN SIDE.
20101220031002.905|20101220031004.907|CC1|ALSO ON THE SOUTH KOREAN SIDE,
20101220031005.040|20101220031007.476|CC1|NEARLY 30,000 U.S. TROOPS ARE
20101220031007.609|20101220031008.544|CC1|BASED THERE.
20101220031008.677|20101220031010.579|CC1|THE AMOUNT OF ARTILLERY AND
20101220031010.712|20101220031012.648|CC1|MISSILES ON BOTH SIDES IS
20101220031012.781|20101220031013.015|CC1|ENORMOUS.
20101220031013.148|20101220031014.516|CC1|IF THE SITUATION STARTS GOING,
20101220031014.650|20101220031017.019|CC1|IT WOULD BE HUGELY DANGEROUS,
20101220031017.152|20101220031018.620|CC1|HUGE CATASTROPHE, AND ON TOP OF
20101220031018.754|20101220031020.055|CC1|ALL OF THAT, LET'S NOT FORGET
20101220031020.189|20101220031022.024|CC1|THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE NUCLEAR
20101220031022.157|20101220031024.626|CC1|WEAPONS AS WELL, SO IT'S AN
20101220031024.760|20101220031025.360|CC1|ALARMING SITUATION.
20101220031025.494|20101220031027.396|CC1|EVERYBODY APPRECIATES THAT, AND
20101220031027.529|20101220031029.264|CC1|SOMETIMES EVEN, YOU KNOW, SMALL
20101220031029.398|20101220031031.533|CC1|INCIDENT COULD CAUSE A MAJOR
20101220031031.667|20101220031032.534|CC1|CONFRONTATION WHICH EVERYONE
20101220031032.668|20101220031034.002|CC1|WANTS TO AVOID.
20101220031034.136|20101220031035.504|CC1|RICHARDSON IS DOING HIS BEST TO
20101220031035.637|20101220031038.006|CC1|TRY TO GET SOME SORT OF

20101220031040.075|20101220031040.576|CC1|OF NORTH KOREA.

20101220031043.011|20101220031043.645|CC1|I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
20101220031043.779|20101220031045.714|CC1|HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIND OUT SOON,
20101220031045.848|20101220031047.483|CC1|BUT I THINK THAT CLOCK IS
20101220031047.616|20101220031047.816|CC1|TICKING.
20101220031047.950|20101220031050.486|CC1|IF THE SOUTH KOREANS BEGIN THIS
20101220031050.619|20101220031051.754|CC1|EXERCISE, THE NORTH KOREANS
20101220031051.887|20101220031052.988|CC1|SAYING IT'S UP TO THE NORTH
20101220031053.122|20101220031056.792|CC1|KOREAN MILITARY THEN TO RESPOND
20101220031056.925|20101220031058.360|CC1|BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THEIR

20101220031105.000|20101220031106.268|CC1|BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS

20101220031326.175|20101220031328.611|CC1|WHAT IT SEEMS WHEN YOU'RE NOT
20101220031328.745|20101220031330.013|CC1|IN -- WHEN YOU'RE THERE, THEY
20101220031330.146|20101220031331.247|CC1|FEEL BELEAGUERED AND UNDER
20101220031331.381|20101220031332.382|CC1|THREAT AND THEIR REACTION IS TO
20101220031332.515|20101220031333.983|CC1|LASH OUT, AND IF THEY SAY THEY
20101220031334.117|20101220031335.018|CC1|ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING, WOULD
20101220031335.151|20101220031336.419|CC1|I TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD AND
20101220031336.552|20101220031338.254|CC1|THE DANGER IS, IF THE SOUTH
20101220031338.388|20101220031340.256|CC1|KOREANS GO AHEAD AND THE NORTH
20101220031340.390|20101220031341.491|CC1|KOREANS RESPOND AND THE SOUTH
20101220031341.624|20101220031343.226|CC1|KOREANS RETALIATE THEN YOU GET A
20101220031343.359|20101220031344.093|CC1|CYCLE OF ESCALATION THAT COULD
20101220031344.227|20101220031345.762|CC1|BE VERY HARD TO CONTROL.
20101220031345.895|20101220031347.497|CC1|>> AND MY, WE HAVE VIDEO OF YOU.
20101220031347.630|20101220031349.766|CC1|YOU SAID SOME 14 TIMES THERE IN
20101220031349.899|20101220031351.668|CC1|NORTH KOREA THAT YOU HAVE BEEN.
20101220031351.801|20101220031353.469|CC1|I WANT YOU TO TELL ME IF YOU
20101220031353.603|20101220031355.605|CC1|BELIEVE THAT WE ARE HEADED HERE
20101220031355.738|20101220031358.107|CC1|BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH
20101220031358.241|20101220031359.909|CC1|AN ALL-OUT WAR AND THEN TAKE US
20101220031400.043|20101220031402.512|CC1|BEHIND THE SCENES AND THE PLACE,
20101220031402.645|20101220031403.947|CC1|PLACES WHERE NOT MANY AMERICANS,
20101220031404.080|20101220031405.615|CC1|MOST AMERICANS WON'T EVER GO AND
20101220031405.748|20101220031407.383|CC1|A LOT OF JOURNALISTS DON'T GET
20101220031407.517|20101220031408.051|CC1|TO GO AS WELL.
20101220031408.184|20101220031409.953|CC1|>> THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S
20101220031410.086|20101220031411.354|CC1|CLEARLY NOT IN NORTH KOREA'S
20101220031411.488|20101220031413.323|CC1|INTEREST TO HAVE AN ALL-OUT WAR
20101220031413.456|20101220031414.457|CC1|BECAUSE THERE IS NO QUESTION IN
20101220031414.591|20101220031416.926|CC1|AN ALL-OUT WAR FACING A MODERN
20101220031417.060|20101220031418.395|CC1|SOPHISTICATED SOUTH KOREAN
20101220031418.528|20101220031421.965|CC1|MILITARY AND AN AMERICAN
20101220031422.098|20101220031422.699|CC1|MILITARY THAT THEY'D LOSE, AND
20101220031422.832|20101220031423.800|CC1|IT'S CLEARLY NOT IN SOUTH
20101220031423.933|20101220031425.402|CC1|KOREA'S INTEREST TO HAVE AN
20101220031425.535|20101220031426.136|CC1|ALL-OUT WAR EITHER BECAUSE SOUTH
20101220031426.269|20101220031428.238|CC1|KOREA IS ONE OF THE MOST MODERN
20101220031428.371|20101220031431.775|CC1|DYNAMIC ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD
20101220031431.908|20101220031433.209|CC1|AND THAT WOULD CAUSE DEVASTATING
20101220031433.343|20101220031434.277|CC1|DAMAGE AND IT'S CLEARLY NOT IN
20101220031434.411|20101220031435.378|CC1|THE INTEREST OF ANYONE ELSE TO
20101220031435.512|20101220031436.012|CC1|HAVE A WAR.
20101220031436.146|20101220031437.213|CC1|WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A
20101220031437.347|20101220031438.882|CC1|SITUATION WHERE BOTH SIDES ARE
20101220031439.015|20101220031440.517|CC1|PLAYING BRINKSMANSHIP, AND THE
20101220031440.650|20101220031444.187|CC1|NORTH KOREANS HAVE A LONG
20101220031444.321|20101220031446.423|CC1|HISTORY OF GOING FURTHER TOWARDS
20101220031446.556|20101220031447.824|CC1|THE BRINK THAN ANYONE ELSE AND
20101220031447.958|20101220031448.792|CC1|CALCULATING THAT EVERYONE ELSE
20101220031448.925|20101220031450.460|CC1|WILL NOT TAKE THOSE RISKY STEPS
20101220031450.594|20101220031452.329|CC1|AND BACK OFF, SO I THINK THE
20101220031452.462|20101220031455.432|CC1|DANGER OF A CLASH IS VERY REAL.
20101220031455.565|20101220031459.269|CC1|I'M REALLY NOT SURE YET WHETHER
20101220031459.402|20101220031500.904|CC1|OR NOT THERE IS THE POLITICAL
20101220031501.037|20101220031502.873|CC1|WILL AND SKILL ON -- AMONG ALL
20101220031503.006|20101220031503.907|CC1|THE PARTIES INVOLVED, THE NORTH,
20101220031504.040|20101220031505.442|CC1|THE SOUTH, THE CHINESE, THE
20101220031505.575|20101220031507.644|CC1|AMERICANS, OTHERS, TO MANAGE ANY
20101220031507.777|20101220031509.412|CC1|CLASH AND KEEP IT WITHIN BOUNDS.
20101220031509.546|20101220031511.715|CC1|I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO
20101220031511.848|20101220031512.582|CC1|DANGEROUS, BECAUSE THE NORTH
20101220031512.716|20101220031514.317|CC1|DOES HAVE A VERY POWERFUL
20101220031514.451|20101220031516.620|CC1|MILITARY, DESPITE ITS DISASTROUS
20101220031516.753|20101220031517.154|CC1|ECONOMIC SITUATION.
20101220031517.287|20101220031519.489|CC1|THEY COULD INFLICT TREMENDOUS
20101220031519.623|20101220031520.924|CC1|DAMAGE ON SOUTH KOREA.
20101220031521.057|20101220031522.893|CC1|THEY COULD PUT THOUSANDS OF
20101220031523.026|20101220031523.827|CC1|ARTILLERY SHELLS INTO THE SOUTH
20101220031523.960|20101220031526.797|CC1|KOREAN CAPITAL SEOUL IN A MATTER
20101220031526.930|20101220031528.799|CC1|OF MINUTES, IF IT CAME TO THAT.
20101220031528.932|20101220031530.200|CC1|THE SHOWN THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS
20101220031530.333|20101220031532.102|CC1|NOW UNFOLDS, BOTH SIDES WILL
20101220031532.235|20101220031533.103|CC1|PULL BACK FROM THE BRINK.
20101220031533.236|20101220031534.938|CC1|THE DANGER IS BOTH SIDES HAVE
20101220031535.072|20101220031536.473|CC1|LOCKED THEMSELVES INTO A
20101220031536.606|20101220031537.474|CC1|SITUATION WHERE THAT MIGHT BE
20101220031537.607|20101220031538.075|CC1|HARD TO DO.

20101220033302.392|20101220033303.727|CC1|CORRESPONDENT BARBARA STARR JUST
20101220033303.860|20101220033305.328|CC1|A SHORT TIME AGO AND I ASKED HER
20101220033305.462|20101220033310.834|CC1|WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE U.S.
20101220033310.967|20101220033311.201|CC1|MILITARY.
20101220033311.335|20101220033312.769|CC1|>> CLEARLY THE U.S. MILITARY

20101220033314.338|20101220033317.941|CC1|IS NO ESCALATION OF HOSTILITIES,
20101220033318.075|20101220033319.242|CC1|THERE IS NO EXCHANGE OF FIRE.
20101220033319.376|20101220033320.978|CC1|THE U.S. MILITARY WOULD LIKE TO
20101220033321.111|20101220033323.080|CC1|NOT BE INVOLVED IN ANY OF THIS
20101220033323.213|20101220033326.516|CC1|AND NOT HAVE ANY REASON TO BE
20101220033326.650|20101220033327.985|CC1|INVOLVED, SO THEIR GOAL HAS BEEN
20101220033328.118|20101220033329.620|CC1|TO TALK TO THE SOUTH KOREANS AND
20101220033329.753|20101220033332.222|CC1|SAY, YES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO

20101220033340.030|20101220033342.633|CC1|FOR THE VERY SAME REASON.
20101220033342.766|20101220033344.935|CC1|WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT IS THE
20101220033345.068|20101220033347.871|CC1|NOTION OF MILITARY
20101220033348.005|20101220033348.338|CC1|MISCALCULATION.
20101220033348.472|20101220033349.506|CC1|IF SOMETHING GOT STARTED, WHAT

20101220033350.708|20101220033352.409|CC1|NIGHTMARE SCENARIO, AND NOBODY
20101220033352.543|20101220033354.044|CC1|WANTS TO SEE THAT, AND NOBODY
20101220033354.178|20101220033356.714|CC1|WANTS ANYTHING TO START HERE.
20101220033356.847|20101220033357.948|CC1|>> AND CERTAINLY WITH ALMOST
20101220033358.082|20101220033359.683|CC1|30,000 TROOPS IN THAT AREA, IT'S
20101220033359.817|20101220033402.019|CC1|A DEFINITE POSSIBILITY IF THIS
20101220033402.152|20101220033404.288|CC1|DOES RATCHET UP THAT THE U.S.
20101220033404.421|20101220033405.789|CC1|AND TROOPS THERE COULD BECOME
20101220033405.923|20101220033411.562|CC1|INVOLVED IN THIS.

20101220033412.229|20101220033413.130|CC1|>> IT IS A POSSIBILITY, THE LAST

20101220033414.098|20101220033415.633|CC1|WANTS TO SEE AND ACTUALLY IT'S
20101220033415.766|20101220033416.166|CC1|PRETTY INTERESTING.
