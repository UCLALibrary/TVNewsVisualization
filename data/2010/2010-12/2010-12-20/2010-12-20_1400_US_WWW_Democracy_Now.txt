20101220140036.685|20101220140038.354|TR0|occurred earlier today on 
20101220140038.354|20101220140040.022|TR0|Yeonpyeong Island, where four

20101220140055.039|20101220140056.708|TR0|protests from China and Russia.

20101220140515.335|20101220140517.003|TR0|concerned about, is one with

20101220140522.009|20101220140523.677|TR0|increasingly likely. We heard 
20101220140523.677|20101220140525.346|TR0|reports yesterday that a secret

20101220140532.020|20101220140533.689|TR0|that there are more suggestions 
20101220140533.689|20101220140535.357|TR0|of that. Senior legal figures 
20101220140535.357|20101220140537.026|TR0|are saying they believe it's 
20101220140537.026|20101220140538.694|TR0|possibly 80 percent likely, and 
20101220140538.694|20101220140540.363|TR0|principal figures that would be 
20101220140540.363|20101220140542.032|TR0|responsible for such an

20101220141345.914|20101220141347.583|TR0|cancer, but ended up speaking on 
20101220141347.583|20101220141349.251|TR0|the floor of the Senate and did 
20101220141349.251|20101220141350.920|TR0|vote.

20101220141352.588|20101220141354.257|TR0|The most vocal opponent of 
20101220141354.257|20101220141355.925|TR0|overturning "Don't Ask, Don't 
20101220141355.925|20101220141357.594|TR0|Tell" has been Republican 
20101220141357.594|20101220141359.262|TR0|Senator John McCain of Arizona. 
20101220141359.262|20101220141400.931|TR0|During the debate, McCain argued 
20101220141400.931|20101220141402.600|TR0|ending the ban on gays serving 
20101220141402.600|20101220141404.268|TR0|openly in the armed forces would 
20101220141404.268|20101220141405.937|TR0|be harmful to the military.

20101220141407.605|20101220141409.274|TR0|>> SEN. JOHN McCAIN: I hope that 
20101220141409.274|20101220141410.942|TR0|when we pass this legislation, 
20101220141410.942|20101220141412.611|TR0|that we will understand that we 
20101220141412.611|20101220141414.280|TR0|are doing great damage and we 
20101220141414.280|20101220141415.948|TR0|could possibly, and probably, as 
20101220141415.948|20101220141417.617|TR0|a commandant of the Marine Corps 
20101220141417.617|20101220141419.285|TR0|said and I've been told by 
20101220141419.285|20101220141420.954|TR0|literally thousands of members 
20101220141420.954|20101220141422.622|TR0|of the military, harm the battle 
20101220141422.622|20101220141424.291|TR0|effectiveness, which is so vital 
20101220141424.291|20101220141425.959|TR0|to the support - to the survival 
20101220141425.959|20101220141427.628|TR0|of our young men and women in 
20101220141427.628|20101220141429.297|TR0|the military.

20101220141430.965|20101220141432.634|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: But the vote to 
20101220141432.634|20101220141434.302|TR0|end "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was 
20101220141434.302|20101220141435.971|TR0|hailed by many across the 
20101220141435.971|20101220141437.639|TR0|country as an historic moment on 
20101220141437.639|20101220141439.308|TR0|par with the end of racial 
20101220141439.308|20101220141440.976|TR0|segregation in the military. The 
20101220141440.976|20101220141442.645|TR0|repeal will not take effect for 
20101220141442.645|20101220141444.314|TR0|at least 60 days, while some 
20101220141444.314|20101220141445.982|TR0|procedural steps are completed. 
20101220141445.982|20101220141447.651|TR0|In addition, the bill requires 
20101220141447.651|20101220141449.319|TR0|the Defense Secretary to certify 
20101220141449.319|20101220141450.988|TR0|the repeal. Until that time, 
20101220141450.988|20101220141452.656|TR0|"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" is still 
20101220141452.656|20101220141454.325|TR0|in effect. But the 17-year 
20101220141454.325|20101220141455.994|TR0|struggle to overturn it has 
20101220141455.994|20101220141457.662|TR0|finally been won.
20101220141457.662|20101220141459.331|TR0|
20101220141459.331|20101220141500.999|TR0|The policy was first enacted in 
20101220141500.999|20101220141502.668|TR0|1993 by President Bill Clinton. 
20101220141502.668|20101220141504.336|TR0|One of the first people to be 
20101220141504.336|20101220141506.005|TR0|targeted by "Don't Ask, Don't 
20101220141506.005|20101220141507.673|TR0|Tell" was Navy Commander Zoe 
20101220141507.673|20101220141509.342|TR0|Dunning. She came out publicly 
20101220141509.342|20101220141511.011|TR0|as a lesbian at a 1993 rally in 
20101220141511.011|20101220141512.679|TR0|support of a fellow 
20101220141512.679|20101220141514.348|TR0|servicemember who was discharged 
20101220141514.348|20101220141516.016|TR0|under "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." 
20101220141516.016|20101220141517.685|TR0|When the military tried to 
20101220141517.685|20101220141519.353|TR0|discharge her, as well, she 
20101220141519.353|20101220141521.022|TR0|fought back, arguing her sexual 
20101220141521.022|20101220141522.690|TR0|orientation was not conduct but 
20101220141522.690|20101220141524.359|TR0|was status. She won her case, 
20101220141524.359|20101220141526.028|TR0|but her defense strategy was 
20101220141526.028|20101220141527.696|TR0|later deemed unacceptable by 
20101220141527.696|20101220141529.365|TR0|military leaders, meaning she 
20101220141529.365|20101220141531.033|TR0|remained in the service but 
20101220141531.033|20101220141532.702|TR0|others were unable to use the 
20101220141532.702|20101220141534.370|TR0|same defense. Until her 
20101220141534.370|20101220141536.039|TR0|retirement three years ago, Zoe 
20101220141536.039|20101220141537.708|TR0|Dunning was thought to be the 
20101220141537.708|20101220141539.376|TR0|only openly gay person serving 
20101220141539.376|20101220141541.045|TR0|in the U.S. military. She has 
20101220141541.045|20101220141542.713|TR0|been advocating for a repeal of 
20101220141542.713|20101220141544.382|TR0|"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" for the 
20101220141544.382|20101220141546.050|TR0|past 17 years. Zoe Dunning joins 
20101220141546.050|20101220141547.719|TR0|me now from San Francisco.
20101220141547.719|20101220141549.387|TR0|
20101220141549.387|20101220141551.056|TR0|Welcome to Democracy Now! Your 
20101220141551.056|20101220141552.725|TR0|response to this weekend's vote?
20101220141552.725|20101220141554.393|TR0|
20101220141554.393|20101220141556.062|TR0|>> CMDR. ZOE DUNNING: Well, 
20101220141556.062|20101220141557.730|TR0|obviously, this is a vote that 
20101220141557.730|20101220141559.399|TR0|I've been working for for a very 
20101220141559.399|20101220141601.067|TR0|long time, for 17 years. And 
20101220141601.067|20101220141602.736|TR0|it's been a roller-coaster ride. 
20101220141602.736|20101220141604.404|TR0|We've had highs and lows. And I 
20101220141604.404|20101220141606.073|TR0|hit a new low when I was in the 
20101220141606.073|20101220141607.742|TR0|Senate gallery about 10 days ago 
20101220141607.742|20101220141609.410|TR0|and watched the Republicans 
20101220141609.410|20101220141611.079|TR0|successfully filibuster and 
20101220141611.079|20101220141612.747|TR0|prevent a vote on this issue, 
20101220141612.747|20101220141614.416|TR0|when it was attached to the 
20101220141614.416|20101220141616.084|TR0|defense authorization bill. And 
20101220141616.084|20101220141617.753|TR0|so, when they announced the 
20101220141617.753|20101220141619.422|TR0|stand-alone bill, I almost dared 
20101220141619.422|20101220141621.090|TR0|not get my hopes up again. But I 
20101220141621.090|20101220141622.759|TR0|am just ecstatic and elated that 
20101220141622.759|20101220141624.427|TR0|we were able to pass this 
20101220141624.427|20101220141626.096|TR0|legislation. We had tremendous 
20101220141626.096|20101220141627.764|TR0|leadership from Representative 
20101220141627.764|20101220141629.433|TR0|Patrick Murphy from 
20101220141629.433|20101220141631.101|TR0|Pennsylvania, Speaker Pelosi, 
20101220141631.101|20101220141632.770|TR0|Senator Harry Reid, Senator 
20101220141632.770|20101220141634.439|TR0|Levin and Senator Collins. It 
20101220141634.439|20101220141636.107|TR0|would not have happened without 
20101220141636.107|20101220141637.776|TR0|them.
20101220141637.776|20101220141639.444|TR0|
20101220141639.444|20101220141641.113|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Explain again 
20101220141641.113|20101220141642.781|TR0|how it was that you were able to 
20101220141642.781|20101220141644.450|TR0|serve openly in the military 
20101220141644.450|20101220141646.118|TR0|for, what, almost - well, more 
20101220141646.118|20101220141647.787|TR0|than 15 years.
20101220141647.787|20101220141649.456|TR0|
20101220141649.456|20101220141651.124|TR0|>> CMDR. ZOE DUNNING: Well, my 
20101220141651.124|20101220141652.793|TR0|case was an exception, 
20101220141652.793|20101220141654.461|TR0|unfortunately. During this 
20101220141654.461|20101220141656.130|TR0|period of time that I was 
20101220141656.130|20101220141657.798|TR0|allowed to serve openly, we also 
20101220141657.798|20101220141659.467|TR0|had over 13,000 servicemembers 
20101220141659.467|20101220141701.136|TR0|who were being discharged under 
20101220141701.136|20101220141702.804|TR0|"Don't Ask, Don't Tell." I was 
20101220141702.804|20101220141704.473|TR0|one of the very first test 
20101220141704.473|20101220141706.141|TR0|cases. And the way that the 
20101220141706.141|20101220141707.810|TR0|military writes "Don't Ask, 
20101220141707.810|20101220141709.478|TR0|Don't Tell," they equate status 
20101220141709.478|20101220141711.147|TR0|with conduct. So if you make a 
20101220141711.147|20101220141712.815|TR0|statement that you're gay or 
20101220141712.815|20101220141714.484|TR0|lesbian, they assume conduct, in 
20101220141714.484|20101220141716.153|TR0|sort of this bizarre legal fine 
20101220141716.153|20101220141717.821|TR0|- you know, fine print. And so, 
20101220141717.821|20101220141719.490|TR0|the purpose of your discharge 
20101220141719.490|20101220141721.158|TR0|hearing is to rebut the 
20101220141721.158|20101220141722.827|TR0|presumption that you engaged in 
20101220141722.827|20101220141724.495|TR0|conduct. Well, I refused to do 
20101220141724.495|20101220141726.164|TR0|that, because I felt that it was 
20101220141726.164|20101220141727.832|TR0|dishonest to do that, but you 
20101220141727.832|20101220141729.501|TR0|still had to make an attempt. 
20101220141729.501|20101220141731.170|TR0|And so, our attempt at doing 
20101220141731.170|20101220141732.838|TR0|that was to say, look, when I 
20101220141732.838|20101220141734.507|TR0|said that I'm both a lesbian and 
20101220141734.507|20101220141736.175|TR0|a naval officer, I was 
20101220141736.175|20101220141737.844|TR0|discussing my status, I was 
20101220141737.844|20101220141739.512|TR0|discussing who I am; I wasn't 
20101220141739.512|20101220141741.181|TR0|talking about conduct. And the 
20101220141741.181|20101220141742.850|TR0|board of officers found 
20101220141742.850|20101220141744.518|TR0|unanimously in my favor that 
20101220141744.518|20101220141746.187|TR0|that was sufficient.
20101220141746.187|20101220141747.855|TR0|
20101220141747.855|20101220141749.524|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So you not only 
20101220141749.524|20101220141751.192|TR0|remained in the military, you 
20101220141751.192|20101220141752.861|TR0|were promoted from lieutenant to 
20101220141752.861|20101220141754.529|TR0|Navy commander. You remained 
20101220141754.529|20101220141756.198|TR0|there for more than 15 years. 
20101220141756.198|20101220141757.867|TR0|But as you pointed out, more 
20101220141757.867|20101220141759.535|TR0|than 13,000 people were kicked 
20101220141759.535|20101220141801.204|TR0|out of the military because they 
20101220141801.204|20101220141802.872|TR0|were gay or lesbian. Explain 
20101220141802.872|20101220141804.541|TR0|what happens now. It isn't over

20101220141807.878|20101220141809.546|TR0|>> CMDR. ZOE DUNNING: It's not 
20101220141809.546|20101220141811.215|TR0|over today, you're correct. What 
20101220141811.215|20101220141812.884|TR0|we've done is we have cleared 
20101220141812.884|20101220141814.552|TR0|that last major legislative 
20101220141814.552|20101220141816.221|TR0|hurdle. There are a series of 
20101220141816.221|20101220141817.889|TR0|administrative steps. First of 
20101220141817.889|20101220141819.558|TR0|all, President Clinton - 
20101220141819.558|20101220141821.226|TR0|President - that's a Freudian 
20101220141821.226|20101220141822.895|TR0|slip, President Clinton, because 
20101220141822.895|20101220141824.564|TR0|he's the one who enacted the 
20101220141824.564|20101220141826.232|TR0|policy. President Obama needs to 
20101220141826.232|20101220141827.901|TR0|sign the bill. I'm actually 
20101220141827.901|20101220141829.569|TR0|flying to Washington, D.C. for 
20101220141829.569|20101220141831.238|TR0|that this week, to be present 
20101220141831.238|20101220141832.906|TR0|for that historic moment. After 
20101220141832.906|20101220141834.575|TR0|he signs it, there's this 
20101220141834.575|20101220141836.243|TR0|certification process that was 
20101220141836.243|20101220141837.912|TR0|written into the bill. And so, 
20101220141837.912|20101220141839.581|TR0|none of this implementation can 
20101220141839.581|20101220141841.249|TR0|happen until the chairman of the 
20101220141841.249|20101220141842.918|TR0|Joint Chiefs Admiral Mullen, 
20101220141842.918|20101220141844.586|TR0|Secretary of Defense Robert 
20101220141844.586|20101220141846.255|TR0|Gates, and the President certify 
20101220141846.255|20101220141847.923|TR0|that the military is prepared 
20101220141847.923|20101220141849.592|TR0|and ready.
20101220141849.592|20101220141851.260|TR0|
20101220141851.260|20101220141852.929|TR0|There's been some debate about 
20101220141852.929|20101220141854.598|TR0|how long this certification 
20101220141854.598|20101220141856.266|TR0|process will take. There are 
20101220141856.266|20101220141857.935|TR0|some that want it immediately; 
20101220141857.935|20101220141859.603|TR0|there are others that are 
20101220141859.603|20101220141901.272|TR0|worried that the Pentagon is 
20101220141901.272|20101220141902.940|TR0|going to slow-roll it. And 
20101220141902.940|20101220141904.609|TR0|there's even rumor that they're 
20101220141904.609|20101220141906.278|TR0|going to try to slow-roll it and 
20101220141906.278|20101220141907.946|TR0|push off certification for 
20101220141907.946|20101220141909.615|TR0|nearly a year. So we're pushing 
20101220141909.615|20101220141911.283|TR0|very strongly to have 
20101220141911.283|20101220141912.952|TR0|certification done as soon as 
20101220141912.952|20101220141914.620|TR0|they're ready, but - you know, 
20101220141914.620|20101220141916.289|TR0|within a month or two. And then, 
20101220141916.289|20101220141917.957|TR0|after that, there's a 60-day 
20101220141917.957|20101220141919.626|TR0|waiting period before we can 
20101220141919.626|20101220141921.295|TR0|actually pull the trigger and 
20101220141921.295|20101220141922.963|TR0|say "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" has 
20101220141922.963|20101220141924.632|TR0|officially been repealed.
20101220141924.632|20101220141926.300|TR0|
20101220141926.300|20101220141927.969|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And so, until 
20101220141927.969|20101220141929.637|TR0|that time, can people be kicked 
20101220141929.637|20101220141931.306|TR0|out?
20101220141931.306|20101220141932.974|TR0|
20101220141932.974|20101220141934.643|TR0|>> CMDR. ZOE DUNNING: 
20101220141934.643|20101220141936.312|TR0|Absolutely. And that's one of 
20101220141936.312|20101220141937.980|TR0|the warnings we want to give 
20101220141937.980|20101220141939.649|TR0|servicemembers who may be 
20101220141939.649|20101220141941.317|TR0|listening or watching. If you 
20101220141941.317|20101220141942.986|TR0|are currently in the military, 
20101220141942.986|20101220141944.654|TR0|are gay or lesbian or bisexual, 
20101220141944.654|20101220141946.323|TR0|it's not safe yet to come out. 
20101220141946.323|20101220141947.992|TR0|They are still pursuing 
20101220141947.992|20101220141949.660|TR0|discharges. And so, you just 
20101220141949.660|20101220141951.329|TR0|have to hang in there and wait a 
20101220141951.329|20101220141952.997|TR0|little bit longer. And we're 
20101220141952.997|20101220141954.666|TR0|doing as best we can to make 
20101220141954.666|20101220141956.334|TR0|that period of time when we have 
20101220141956.334|20101220141958.003|TR0|to hide who we are and pretend 
20101220141958.003|20101220141959.671|TR0|we're something else come to an 
20101220141959.671|20101220142001.340|TR0|end.

20101220142003.009|20101220142004.677|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And the position 
20101220142004.677|20101220142006.346|TR0|of Senator McCain, in 
20101220142006.346|20101220142008.014|TR0|particular, the man who said if 
20101220142008.014|20101220142009.683|TR0|there was a poll of the military 
20101220142009.683|20101220142011.351|TR0|leaders, he would do what they 
20101220142011.351|20101220142013.020|TR0|supported. They came out 
20101220142013.020|20101220142014.688|TR0|overwhelmingly in support of 
20101220142014.688|20101220142016.357|TR0|repealing "Don't Ask, Don't 
20101220142016.357|20101220142018.026|TR0|Tell," from Gates to the chair 
20101220142018.026|20101220142019.694|TR0|of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
20101220142019.694|20101220142021.363|TR0|Admiral Mullen and others, and 
20101220142021.363|20101220142023.031|TR0|yet he still refused to support 
20101220142023.031|20101220142024.700|TR0|it, Navy Commander Zoe Dunning.
20101220142024.700|20101220142026.368|TR0|
20101220142026.368|20101220142028.037|TR0|>> CMDR. ZOE DUNNING: Well, it's 
20101220142028.037|20101220142029.706|TR0|very disappointing. I have 
20101220142029.706|20101220142031.374|TR0|always admired, actually, 
20101220142031.374|20101220142033.043|TR0|Senator McCain for his service. 
20101220142033.043|20101220142034.711|TR0|But when he kept moving the 
20101220142034.711|20101220142036.380|TR0|goalposts, he would say, as you 
20101220142036.380|20101220142038.048|TR0|mentioned, "Once I hear from 
20101220142038.048|20101220142039.717|TR0|military leaders that it's OK to 
20101220142039.717|20101220142041.385|TR0|repeal, I'm with them." They 
20101220142041.385|20101220142043.054|TR0|said it. He backed off the claim 
20101220142043.054|20101220142044.723|TR0|and said, "Well, those aren't 
20101220142044.723|20101220142046.391|TR0|the right military leaders. I 
20101220142046.391|20101220142048.060|TR0|want to talk to other military 
20101220142048.060|20101220142049.728|TR0|leaders." And then he said, "I 
20101220142049.728|20101220142051.397|TR0|want to have a Pentagon study of 
20101220142051.397|20101220142053.065|TR0|this to find out what the impact 
20101220142053.065|20101220142054.734|TR0|is to those who are serving." We 
20101220142054.734|20101220142056.402|TR0|did a study. We did a very 
20101220142056.402|20101220142058.071|TR0|expensive study. We surveyed 
20101220142058.071|20101220142059.740|TR0|hundreds of thousands of troops. 
20101220142059.740|20101220142101.408|TR0|We got their opinions. And then 
20101220142101.408|20101220142103.077|TR0|when the report came out, he 
20101220142103.077|20101220142104.745|TR0|said, "Well, that's not the 
20101220142104.745|20101220142106.414|TR0|right study. That's not the 
20101220142106.414|20101220142108.082|TR0|right questions" that we asked. 
20101220142108.082|20101220142109.751|TR0|"I want another study." And so, 
20101220142109.751|20101220142111.420|TR0|it was just continuous delay and 
20101220142111.420|20101220142113.088|TR0|postponement of the inevitable.

20101220142114.757|20101220142116.425|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: The Marines, the 
20101220142116.425|20101220142118.094|TR0|Marine commandant has said he 
20101220142118.094|20101220142119.762|TR0|does not support this. There was 
20101220142119.762|20101220142121.431|TR0|overwhelming support in the 
20101220142121.431|20101220142123.099|TR0|survey of troops all over the 
20101220142123.099|20101220142124.768|TR0|world, except in the Marines. 
20101220142124.768|20101220142126.437|TR0|So, explain what happened there.
20101220142126.437|20101220142128.105|TR0|
20101220142128.105|20101220142129.774|TR0|>> CMDR. ZOE DUNNING: Well, one 
20101220142129.774|20101220142131.442|TR0|of the things when you do a 
20101220142131.442|20101220142133.111|TR0|study and you have statistics is 
20101220142133.111|20101220142134.779|TR0|you can cherry-pick those which 
20101220142134.779|20101220142136.448|TR0|seem to support your argument. 
20101220142136.448|20101220142138.116|TR0|So, there is in the study a 
20101220142138.116|20101220142139.785|TR0|recognition that those who are 
20101220142139.785|20101220142141.454|TR0|Marines in forward-deployed 
20101220142141.454|20101220142143.122|TR0|units did state that they were 
20101220142143.122|20101220142144.791|TR0|not comfortable with repealing 
20101220142144.791|20101220142146.459|TR0|"Don't Ask, Don't Tell," that 
20101220142146.459|20101220142148.128|TR0|they didn't like that idea. But 
20101220142148.128|20101220142149.796|TR0|what's important to see is what 
20101220142149.796|20101220142151.465|TR0|is actual experience versus what 
20101220142151.465|20101220142153.134|TR0|is hypothetical. And so, when 
20101220142153.134|20101220142154.802|TR0|you ask in a hypothetical, you 
20101220142154.802|20101220142156.471|TR0|know, "Do you think it's a good 
20101220142156.471|20101220142158.139|TR0|idea? Do you think it would harm 
20101220142158.139|20101220142159.808|TR0|your unit?" you know, they did 
20101220142159.808|20101220142201.476|TR0|respond more negatively than 
20101220142201.476|20101220142203.145|TR0|positively, the Marines that 
20101220142203.145|20101220142204.813|TR0|were forward-deployed. But the 
20101220142204.813|20101220142206.482|TR0|important statistic from that 
20101220142206.482|20101220142208.151|TR0|study is if you talk to people 
20101220142208.151|20101220142209.819|TR0|who have actually served with 
20101220142209.819|20101220142211.488|TR0|someone that they knew to be or 
20101220142211.488|20101220142213.156|TR0|suspected to be gay or lesbian, 
20101220142213.156|20101220142214.825|TR0|actual experience, 92 percent of 
20101220142214.825|20101220142216.493|TR0|them said it had absolutely no 
20101220142216.493|20101220142218.162|TR0|negative impact to their unit's 
20101220142218.162|20101220142219.830|TR0|effectiveness or morale.

20101220142234.848|20101220142236.516|TR0|obviously it's a goal I've been 
20101220142236.516|20101220142238.185|TR0|pursuing a very long time. And I 
20101220142238.185|20101220142239.853|TR0|think, in reality, once this is 
20101220142239.853|20101220142241.522|TR0|lifted, you're not going to have 
20101220142241.522|20101220142243.190|TR0|a mass coming out. I think most 
20101220142243.190|20101220142244.859|TR0|people just want to be able to 
20101220142244.859|20101220142246.527|TR0|come to work without fear that 
20101220142246.527|20101220142248.196|TR0|they're going to lose their job 
20101220142248.196|20101220142249.865|TR0|that day.
20101220142249.865|20101220142251.533|TR0|
20101220142251.533|20101220142253.202|TR0|When I was at a press conference 
20101220142253.202|20101220142254.870|TR0|immediately following the 
20101220142254.870|20101220142256.539|TR0|decision and the interviews were 
20101220142256.539|20101220142258.207|TR0|ending, a young man walked up to 
20101220142258.207|20101220142259.876|TR0|me, and he shook my hand and he 
20101220142259.876|20101220142301.544|TR0|looked me in the eye with tears 
20101220142301.544|20101220142303.213|TR0|in his eyes, and he said, "Thank 
20101220142303.213|20101220142304.882|TR0|you." He introduced himself. 
20101220142304.882|20101220142306.550|TR0|He's a Air Force airman. He's 
20101220142306.550|20101220142308.219|TR0|been serving for 11 years. He's 
20101220142308.219|20101220142309.887|TR0|done three tours in Iraq and 
20101220142309.887|20101220142311.556|TR0|Afghanistan. And he just gave me 
20101220142311.556|20101220142313.224|TR0|a great big bear hug and cried 
20101220142313.224|20101220142314.893|TR0|on my shoulder and said in my 
20101220142314.893|20101220142316.562|TR0|ear over and over again, "Thank 
20101220142316.562|20101220142318.230|TR0|you, thank you, thank you." And 
20101220142318.230|20101220142319.899|TR0|that's who we did this fight is 
20101220142319.899|20101220142321.567|TR0|for. It's for those young 
20101220142321.567|20101220142323.236|TR0|servicemembers who are putting 
20101220142323.236|20101220142324.904|TR0|their lives on the line overseas 
20101220142324.904|20101220142326.573|TR0|and making sure that we are 
20101220142326.573|20101220142328.241|TR0|respecting them and allowing 
20101220142328.241|20101220142329.910|TR0|them to serve without fear of 
20101220142329.910|20101220142331.579|TR0|losing their career for no other 
20101220142331.579|20101220142333.247|TR0|reason than their sexual 
20101220142333.247|20101220142334.916|TR0|orientation, which has 
20101220142334.916|20101220142336.584|TR0|absolutely no impact on their 
20101220142336.584|20101220142338.253|TR0|ability to do the job.

20101220142408.287|20101220142409.955|TR0|The only group that will see its 
20101220142409.955|20101220142411.624|TR0|taxes increase are the nation's

20101220142431.647|20101220142433.315|TR0|on to say, quote, "Liberal

20101220142456.675|20101220142458.344|TR0|is just another example of a

20101220142655.143|20101220142656.811|TR0|by the Nazis, used to sell an

20101220142701.817|20101220142703.486|TR0|anarchist, Socialist, Communist 
20101220142703.486|20101220142705.154|TR0|movements that had frightened

20101220142706.823|20101220142708.491|TR0|World War I. And they employed 
20101220142708.491|20101220142710.160|TR0|for the first time the 
20101220142710.160|20101220142711.828|TR0|techniques of mass crowd

20101220142713.497|20101220142715.166|TR0|like Le Bon, Trotter and Sigmund 
20101220142715.166|20101220142716.834|TR0|Freud. They understood that 
20101220142716.834|20101220142718.503|TR0|people were moved or manipulated 
20101220142718.503|20101220142720.171|TR0|not by fact or reason, but by 
20101220142720.171|20101220142721.840|TR0|what Walter Lippmann calls the 
20101220142721.840|20101220142723.508|TR0|"manufacturing of consent" in 
20101220142723.508|20101220142725.177|TR0|his 1922 book Public Opinion. 
20101220142725.177|20101220142726.846|TR0|And we've never recovered ever 
20101220142726.846|20101220142728.514|TR0|since.
20101220142728.514|20101220142730.183|TR0|
20101220142730.183|20101220142731.851|TR0|So the assault and destruction 
20101220142731.851|20101220142733.520|TR0|of these populist or radical 
20101220142733.520|20101220142735.188|TR0|movements, which kept liberal 
20101220142735.188|20101220142736.857|TR0|institutions honest, and then 
20101220142736.857|20101220142738.525|TR0|the purges within liberal 
20101220142738.525|20101220142740.194|TR0|institutions, especially the 
20101220142740.194|20101220142741.863|TR0|anti-Communist purges of the 
20101220142741.863|20101220142743.531|TR0|1950s. And many people who were 
20101220142743.531|20101220142745.200|TR0|expelled from these institutions 
20101220142745.200|20101220142746.868|TR0|were no way Communist, figures 
20101220142746.868|20101220142748.537|TR0|like I.F. Stone, arguably our 
20101220142748.537|20101220142750.205|TR0|greatest journalist of the 20th 
20101220142750.205|20101220142751.874|TR0|century, couldn't even get a job 
20101220142751.874|20101220142753.542|TR0|at The Nation magazine and ends 
20101220142753.542|20101220142755.211|TR0|up a pariah. He's not alone - 
20101220142755.211|20101220142756.880|TR0|thousands and thousands of 
20101220142756.880|20101220142758.548|TR0|people. So that with the rise of 
20101220142758.548|20101220142800.217|TR0|neoliberalism and the corporate 
20101220142800.217|20101220142801.885|TR0|state under Clinton, these - we 
20101220142801.885|20101220142803.554|TR0|lost the radical movements, and 
20101220142803.554|20101220142805.222|TR0|we lost the liberal institutions 
20101220142805.222|20101220142806.891|TR0|that normally make possible 
20101220142806.891|20101220142808.560|TR0|incremental or piecemeal reform 
20101220142808.560|20101220142810.228|TR0|within the formal mechanisms of 
20101220142810.228|20101220142811.897|TR0|power.

20101220142813.565|20101220142815.234|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Explain what 
20101220142815.234|20101220142816.902|TR0|happened within the universities.
20101220142816.902|20101220142818.571|TR0|
20101220142818.571|20101220142820.239|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: Well, there was 
20101220142820.239|20101220142821.908|TR0|- of course, one of the most 
20101220142821.908|20101220142823.577|TR0|egregious examples occurred here 
20101220142823.577|20101220142825.245|TR0|in New York City when 
20101220142825.245|20101220142826.914|TR0|Rockefeller went after City 
20101220142826.914|20101220142828.582|TR0|University. What they did is 
20101220142828.582|20101220142830.251|TR0|they destroyed the capacity for 
20101220142830.251|20101220142831.919|TR0|people outside the power elite 
20101220142831.919|20101220142833.588|TR0|to get great education. City 
20101220142833.588|20101220142835.256|TR0|University at one time was one 
20101220142835.256|20101220142836.925|TR0|of the great universities in the 
20101220142836.925|20101220142838.594|TR0|country and educated, you know, 
20101220142838.594|20101220142840.262|TR0|a huge swath of mostly 
20101220142840.262|20101220142841.931|TR0|first-generation immigrants. The 
20101220142841.931|20101220142843.599|TR0|corporatization of universities 
20101220142843.599|20101220142845.268|TR0|is far advanced now. You have a 
20101220142845.268|20101220142846.936|TR0|withering of the humanities, 
20101220142846.936|20101220142848.605|TR0|destruction of philosophy 
20101220142848.605|20101220142850.274|TR0|departments. Departments must 
20101220142850.274|20101220142851.942|TR0|raise not only their own 
20101220142851.942|20101220142853.611|TR0|research and grant money, but 
20101220142853.611|20101220142855.279|TR0|often their own salaries. Well, 
20101220142855.279|20101220142856.948|TR0|you know, who's going to pay for 
20101220142856.948|20101220142858.616|TR0|that?
20101220142858.616|20101220142900.285|TR0|
20101220142900.285|20101220142901.953|TR0|And so, what we've turned our 
20101220142901.953|20101220142903.622|TR0|universities into are 
20101220142903.622|20101220142905.291|TR0|essentially vocational schools. 
20101220142905.291|20101220142906.959|TR0|If you go to a school like 
20101220142906.959|20101220142908.628|TR0|Princeton, then you will become 
20101220142908.628|20101220142910.296|TR0|a systems manager and go to 
20101220142910.296|20101220142911.965|TR0|Goldman Sachs. If you go to an 
20101220142911.965|20101220142913.633|TR0|inner-city dysfunctional public 
20101220142913.633|20101220142915.302|TR0|school in a place like Camden, 
20101220142915.302|20101220142916.970|TR0|you are trained vocationally to 
20101220142916.970|20101220142918.639|TR0|stock shelves in Walmart. It's a 
20101220142918.639|20101220142920.308|TR0|kind of solidification of a very 
20101220142920.308|20101220142921.976|TR0|pernicious class system, and one 
20101220142921.976|20101220142923.645|TR0|that doesn't train students 
20101220142923.645|20101220142925.313|TR0|anymore to think but to fill 
20101220142925.313|20101220142926.982|TR0|slots.
20101220142926.982|20101220142928.650|TR0|
20101220142928.650|20101220142930.319|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Chris Hedges, 
20101220142930.319|20101220142931.988|TR0|you were a longtime 
20101220142931.988|20101220142933.656|TR0|correspondent for the New York 
20101220142933.656|20101220142935.325|TR0|Times. For two decades you 
20101220142935.325|20101220142936.993|TR0|worked there. You were one of 
20101220142936.993|20101220142938.662|TR0|the premier war correspondents. 
20101220142938.662|20101220142940.330|TR0|You wrote the book War is a 
20101220142940.330|20101220142941.999|TR0|Force that Gives Us Meaning. You 
20101220142941.999|20101220142943.667|TR0|won the Pulitzer Prize about 
20101220142943.667|20101220142945.336|TR0|eight years ago. You talk in 
20101220142945.336|20101220142947.005|TR0|Death of the Liberal Class about 
20101220142947.005|20101220142948.673|TR0|your experience at the Times. 
20101220142948.673|20101220142950.342|TR0|Why don't you go through it for 
20101220142950.342|20101220142952.010|TR0|us in detail and what you think 
20101220142952.010|20101220142953.679|TR0|it indicates?
20101220142953.679|20101220142955.347|TR0|
20101220142955.347|20101220142957.016|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: Well, I spent a 
20101220142957.016|20101220142958.684|TR0|lot of time in the book talking 
20101220142958.684|20101220143000.353|TR0|about those figures, like Sydney 
20101220143000.353|20101220143002.022|TR0|Schanberg and others, who were 
20101220143002.022|20101220143003.690|TR0|expelled from these liberal 
20101220143003.690|20101220143005.359|TR0|institutions - Richard 
20101220143005.359|20101220143007.027|TR0|Goldstone, who wrote the 
20101220143007.027|20101220143008.696|TR0|Goldstone Report on the 22-day 
20101220143008.696|20101220143010.364|TR0|Israeli assault on Gaza, would 
20101220143010.364|20101220143012.033|TR0|be another example - because 
20101220143012.033|20101220143013.702|TR0|there are clear parameters 
20101220143013.702|20101220143015.370|TR0|within these institutions that 
20101220143015.370|20101220143017.039|TR0|you don't cross. The perfect 
20101220143017.039|20101220143018.707|TR0|example would be the buildup to 
20101220143018.707|20101220143020.376|TR0|the Iraq war. Here, the liberal, 
20101220143020.376|20101220143022.044|TR0|so-called self-identified 
20101220143022.044|20101220143023.713|TR0|liberal class - figures like 
20101220143023.713|20101220143025.381|TR0|David Remnick at The New Yorker; 
20101220143025.381|20101220143027.050|TR0|Bill Keller, who was a columnist 
20101220143027.050|20101220143028.719|TR0|at the New York Times, now the 
20101220143028.719|20101220143030.387|TR0|executive editor; George Packer; 
20101220143030.387|20101220143032.056|TR0|on and on, even people like 
20101220143032.056|20101220143033.724|TR0|Frank Rich, people forget - all 
20101220143033.724|20101220143035.393|TR0|backed the war. And they did it 
20101220143035.393|20101220143037.061|TR0|as sort of reluctant hawks. 
20101220143037.061|20101220143038.730|TR0|Probably the poster child for 
20101220143038.730|20101220143040.398|TR0|this was Michael Ignatieff of 
20101220143040.398|20101220143042.067|TR0|the Carr Center, at Harvard, for 
20101220143042.067|20101220143043.736|TR0|Human Rights, who's now the head 
20101220143043.736|20101220143045.404|TR0|of the Liberal Party in Canada.
20101220143045.404|20101220143047.073|TR0|
20101220143047.073|20101220143048.741|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, 
20101220143048.741|20101220143050.410|TR0|that reluctance makes them the 
20101220143050.410|20101220143052.078|TR0|most convincing.
20101220143052.078|20101220143053.747|TR0|
20101220143053.747|20101220143055.416|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: And it - yeah, 
20101220143055.416|20101220143057.084|TR0|of course it does, because it 
20101220143057.084|20101220143058.753|TR0|gives a kind of moral veneer to 
20101220143058.753|20101220143100.421|TR0|a crime. It's heartfelt. "We 
20101220143100.421|20101220143102.090|TR0|don't like war. We all opposed 
20101220143102.090|20101220143103.758|TR0|the Vietnam War." This is almost 
20101220143103.758|20101220143105.427|TR0|verbatim Ignatieff's argument. 
20101220143105.427|20101220143107.095|TR0|And "But it's something that has 
20101220143107.095|20101220143108.764|TR0|to be done. We have to face the 
20101220143108.764|20101220143110.433|TR0|hard, bitter truth of world 
20101220143110.433|20101220143112.101|TR0|politics and recognize that we 
20101220143112.101|20101220143113.770|TR0|are a force for good." Samantha 
20101220143113.770|20101220143115.438|TR0|Power does this, in essence, in 
20101220143115.438|20101220143117.107|TR0|her book on genocide. It's the 
20101220143117.107|20101220143118.775|TR0|idea that the empire is sort of 
20101220143118.775|20101220143120.444|TR0|used to - it can abrogate for 
20101220143120.444|20101220143122.112|TR0|itself the right to use force to 
20101220143122.112|20101220143123.781|TR0|impose virtues. It's an utter 
20101220143123.781|20101220143125.450|TR0|tautology and absurdity to those 
20101220143125.450|20101220143127.118|TR0|of us who have been at war. But 
20101220143127.118|20101220143128.787|TR0|it works. And the function of 
20101220143128.787|20101220143130.455|TR0|the liberal class and why it is 
20101220143130.455|20101220143132.124|TR0|traditionally tolerated by the 
20101220143132.124|20101220143133.792|TR0|power elite is because it 
20101220143133.792|20101220143135.461|TR0|disarms movements that should 
20101220143135.461|20101220143137.130|TR0|have stood up on the eve of the 
20101220143137.130|20101220143138.798|TR0|Iraq war and fought back.
20101220143138.798|20101220143140.467|TR0|
20101220143140.467|20101220143142.135|TR0|And, of course, my own clash 
20101220143142.135|20101220143143.804|TR0|with the New York Times occurred 
20101220143143.804|20101220143145.472|TR0|over the war after I gave a 
20101220143145.472|20101220143147.141|TR0|commencement address, which you 
20101220143147.141|20101220143148.809|TR0|played on Democracy Now!, at 
20101220143148.809|20101220143150.478|TR0|Rockford College, my first and 
20101220143150.478|20101220143152.147|TR0|last invitation to give a 
20101220143152.147|20101220143153.815|TR0|commencement address. And if I 
20101220143153.815|20101220143155.484|TR0|had gotten up and said, "America 
20101220143155.484|20101220143157.152|TR0|is a great democracy that goes 
20101220143157.152|20101220143158.821|TR0|abroad to liberate and provide 
20101220143158.821|20101220143200.489|TR0|freedom and impose - or, you 
20101220143200.489|20101220143202.158|TR0|know, give its sort of virtues 
20101220143202.158|20101220143203.826|TR0|of Western civilization to the 
20101220143203.826|20101220143205.495|TR0|lesser people of the Middle 
20101220143205.495|20101220143207.164|TR0|East," well, nobody would have 
20101220143207.164|20101220143208.832|TR0|said anything. Indeed, John 
20101220143208.832|20101220143210.501|TR0|Burns was quite public in his 
20101220143210.501|20101220143212.169|TR0|support for the war. But to 
20101220143212.169|20101220143213.838|TR0|challenge the intentions and the 
20101220143213.838|20101220143215.506|TR0|virtues of the power elite, 
20101220143215.506|20101220143217.175|TR0|that's the line that the liberal 
20101220143217.175|20101220143218.844|TR0|class - if you cross that line, 
20101220143218.844|20101220143220.512|TR0|which, of course, Goldstone did 
20101220143220.512|20101220143222.181|TR0|in his report - Schanberg did it 
20101220143222.181|20101220143223.849|TR0|when he started writing about 
20101220143223.849|20101220143225.518|TR0|real estate developers who were 
20101220143225.518|20101220143227.186|TR0|driving out low-income and 
20101220143227.186|20101220143228.855|TR0|medium-income New Yorkers from 
20101220143228.855|20101220143230.523|TR0|Manhattan and the homeless on 
20101220143230.523|20101220143232.192|TR0|the streets - then you're out. 
20101220143232.192|20101220143233.861|TR0|Then you are pushed out of the 
20101220143233.861|20101220143235.529|TR0|institution.
20101220143235.529|20101220143237.198|TR0|
20101220143237.198|20101220143238.866|TR0|So, oftentimes there are good 
20101220143238.866|20101220143240.535|TR0|people within these 
20101220143240.535|20101220143242.203|TR0|institutions, but if they hold 
20101220143242.203|20101220143243.872|TR0|fast to these moral imperatives, 
20101220143243.872|20101220143245.540|TR0|inevitably they are shunted 
20101220143245.540|20101220143247.209|TR0|aside. And the problem is, with 
20101220143247.209|20101220143248.878|TR0|the rise of the corporate state 
20101220143248.878|20101220143250.546|TR0|and power systems, especially 
20101220143250.546|20101220143252.215|TR0|financial systems, that by any 
20101220143252.215|20101220143253.883|TR0|definition or any criteria are 
20101220143253.883|20101220143255.552|TR0|criminal, you have liberal 
20101220143255.552|20101220143257.220|TR0|institutions like the New York 
20101220143257.220|20101220143258.889|TR0|Times paying deference to these 
20101220143258.889|20101220143300.558|TR0|institutions, when in fact they 
20101220143300.558|20101220143302.226|TR0|should be challenging them.
20101220143302.226|20101220143303.895|TR0|
20101220143303.895|20101220143305.563|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, if you had 
20101220143305.563|20101220143307.232|TR0|given a speech for the war at 
20101220143307.232|20101220143308.900|TR0|Rockford College, you hardly 
20101220143308.900|20101220143310.569|TR0|would have been reprimanded. But 
20101220143310.569|20101220143312.237|TR0|just for a moment, let's go back 
20101220143312.237|20101220143313.906|TR0|in time. We'll link to it at 
20101220143313.906|20101220143315.575|TR0|democracynow.org, this amazing 
20101220143315.575|20101220143317.243|TR0|moment, the speech that you 
20101220143317.243|20101220143318.912|TR0|gave, that you did not actually 
20101220143318.912|20101220143320.580|TR0|think was going to be that 
20101220143320.580|20101220143322.249|TR0|controversial.
20101220143322.249|20101220143323.917|TR0|
20101220143323.917|20101220143325.586|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: No.
20101220143325.586|20101220143327.254|TR0|
20101220143327.254|20101220143328.923|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: After all, 
20101220143328.923|20101220143330.592|TR0|Rockford College was Jane 
20101220143330.592|20101220143332.260|TR0|Addams' college.

20101220143333.929|20101220143335.597|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: That's all I 
20101220143335.597|20101220143337.266|TR0|knew about it. I thought they 
20101220143337.266|20101220143338.934|TR0|were just pacifist Socialists.
20101220143338.934|20101220143340.603|TR0|
20101220143340.603|20101220143342.272|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: When the police 
20101220143342.272|20101220143343.940|TR0|were escorting you out, why 
20101220143343.940|20101220143345.609|TR0|don't you just quickly explain 
20101220143345.609|20101220143347.277|TR0|what happened, and then what the 
20101220143347.277|20101220143348.946|TR0|Times did about this?
20101220143348.946|20101220143350.614|TR0|
20101220143350.614|20101220143352.283|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: Well, it was - 
20101220143352.283|20101220143353.951|TR0|I had my mike cut. And you can 
20101220143353.951|20101220143355.620|TR0|watch it on YouTube or on  --  
20101220143355.620|20101220143357.289|TR0|link it to democracynow.org. And 
20101220143357.289|20101220143358.957|TR0|I was booed, and people stood up 
20101220143358.957|20101220143400.626|TR0|and started singing "God Bless 
20101220143400.626|20101220143402.294|TR0|America" and jeering and  --
20101220143402.294|20101220143403.963|TR0|
20101220143403.963|20101220143405.631|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And you were 
20101220143405.631|20101220143407.300|TR0|saying?
20101220143407.300|20101220143408.968|TR0|
20101220143408.968|20101220143410.637|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: I was talking 
20101220143410.637|20101220143412.306|TR0|about the consequences of the 
20101220143412.306|20101220143413.974|TR0|war. I spent seven years in the 
20101220143413.974|20101220143415.643|TR0|Middle East, months of my life 
20101220143415.643|20101220143417.311|TR0|in Iraq. I speak Arabic. This 
20101220143417.311|20101220143418.980|TR0|wasn't an opinion. This was 
20101220143418.980|20101220143420.648|TR0|based on a tremendous amount of 
20101220143420.648|20101220143422.317|TR0|time and energy in an area of 
20101220143422.317|20101220143423.986|TR0|the world I knew very well. And 
20101220143423.986|20101220143425.654|TR0|then I was finally escorted  --  
20101220143425.654|20101220143427.323|TR0|they closed all the roads out of 
20101220143427.323|20101220143428.991|TR0|the campus, and the security 
20101220143428.991|20101220143430.660|TR0|escorted me out before the 
20101220143430.660|20101220143432.328|TR0|awarding of diplomas, because 
20101220143432.328|20101220143433.997|TR0|they didn't want the students to 
20101220143433.997|20101220143435.665|TR0|come in close proximity. I had 
20101220143435.665|20101220143437.334|TR0|two young men try and climb up 
20101220143437.334|20101220143439.003|TR0|on the stage at the end and push 
20101220143439.003|20101220143440.671|TR0|me off the podium. And what 
20101220143440.671|20101220143442.340|TR0|happened was the trash talk. Fox 
20101220143442.340|20101220143444.008|TR0|and all these people got a hold 
20101220143444.008|20101220143445.677|TR0|of the home videos and ran it in 
20101220143445.677|20101220143447.345|TR0|these sort of endless loops. So 
20101220143447.345|20101220143449.014|TR0|I was lynched in the same way 
20101220143449.014|20101220143450.682|TR0|they lynched, you know, figures 
20101220143450.682|20101220143452.351|TR0|like my friend Jeremiah Wright. 
20101220143452.351|20101220143454.020|TR0|And  --
20101220143454.020|20101220143455.688|TR0|
20101220143455.688|20101220143457.357|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You almost were 
20101220143457.357|20101220143459.025|TR0|a minister.
20101220143459.025|20101220143500.694|TR0|
20101220143500.694|20101220143502.362|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: Yes, I almost 
20101220143502.362|20101220143504.031|TR0|was. I finished but wasn't 
20101220143504.031|20101220143505.700|TR0|ordained. And the Times had to 
20101220143505.700|20101220143507.368|TR0|respond. So they responded by 
20101220143507.368|20101220143509.037|TR0|giving me a formal written 
20101220143509.037|20101220143510.705|TR0|reprimand, and were Guild - they 
20101220143510.705|20101220143512.374|TR0|were Guild, which means that the 
20101220143512.374|20101220143514.042|TR0|next time I spoke out against 
20101220143514.042|20101220143515.711|TR0|the war, the next time I 
20101220143515.711|20101220143517.379|TR0|violated that warning, I would 
20101220143517.379|20101220143519.048|TR0|be fired. And that's when I left 
20101220143519.048|20101220143520.717|TR0|the paper.
20101220143520.717|20101220143522.385|TR0|
20101220143522.385|20101220143524.054|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You were 
20101220143524.054|20101220143525.722|TR0|actually quite muted in 
20101220143525.722|20101220143527.391|TR0|criticism of the government when 
20101220143527.391|20101220143529.059|TR0|you were at the New York Times 
20101220143529.059|20101220143530.728|TR0|and you were being interviewed, 
20101220143530.728|20101220143532.396|TR0|like by us.
20101220143532.396|20101220143534.065|TR0|
20101220143534.065|20101220143535.734|TR0|>> CHRIS HEDGES: Yeah. The Times 
20101220143535.734|20101220143537.402|TR0|wouldn't consider it muted. 
20101220143537.402|20101220143539.071|TR0|Maybe for Democracy Now! 
20101220143539.071|20101220143540.739|TR0|listeners, it was muted. But 
20101220143540.739|20101220143542.408|TR0|yeah, the stance was - and I 
20101220143542.408|20101220143544.076|TR0|knew what I was doing. I had 
20101220143544.076|20101220143545.745|TR0|been there 15 years. It was a 
20101220143545.745|20101220143547.414|TR0|kind of career suicide. But I 
20101220143547.414|20101220143549.082|TR0|felt so strongly that this was a 
20101220143549.082|20101220143550.751|TR0|mistake, and there were so few 
20101220143550.751|20101220143552.419|TR0|of us that had that kind of 
20101220143552.419|20101220143554.088|TR0|experience, in particular, in 
20101220143554.088|20101220143555.756|TR0|the Arab world, that I had a 
20101220143555.756|20101220143557.425|TR0|kind of duty to speak out.

20101220143629.128|20101220143630.796|TR0|they fly, constant intrusions by

20101220143632.465|20101220143634.133|TR0|privacy, when these people have

20101220143635.802|20101220143637.470|TR0|being demonized, especially by

20101220143649.150|20101220143650.819|TR0|very, very frightened for what's 
20101220143650.819|20101220143652.487|TR0|going to happen to American 
20101220143652.487|20101220143654.156|TR0|Muslims, who are hardly radical. 
20101220143654.156|20101220143655.824|TR0|Every time I go to these groups, 
20101220143655.824|20101220143657.493|TR0|they fall all - the most radical 
20101220143657.493|20101220143659.162|TR0|person in the room is myself, or 
20101220143659.162|20101220143700.830|TR0|they fall all over themselves to 
20101220143700.830|20101220143702.499|TR0|talk about American democracy 
20101220143702.499|20101220143704.167|TR0|and how great it is and how they

20101220143705.836|20101220143707.504|TR0|It's heartbreaking to watch.

20101220143709.173|20101220143710.842|TR0|I mean, I spoke at the Jerusalem

20101220143712.510|20101220143714.179|TR0|talk - you know, I can get away 
20101220143714.179|20101220143715.847|TR0|with it, because I'm not Muslim. 
20101220143715.847|20101220143717.516|TR0|The director got up and said, 
20101220143717.516|20101220143719.184|TR0|"You know, this is his own

20101220143722.521|20101220143724.190|TR0|do with his stance." The fear - 
20101220143724.190|20101220143725.859|TR0|and legitimate fear - that has 
20101220143725.859|20101220143727.527|TR0|been driven by Neanderthals like

20101220143729.196|20101220143730.864|TR0|demonizing American Muslims is

20101220143800.898|20101220143802.567|TR0|this tax bill was passed, which

20101220143820.921|20101220143822.590|TR0|prominent theme that Martin 
20101220143822.590|20101220143824.258|TR0|Luther King beat home, 
20101220143824.258|20101220143825.927|TR0|especially in the last years of

20101220143827.595|20101220143829.264|TR0|that - especially because we're 
20101220143829.264|20101220143830.932|TR0|going into debt. I mean, we're 
20101220143830.932|20101220143832.601|TR0|building a kind of debt peonage 
20101220143832.601|20101220143834.270|TR0|system, which is used then as an 
20101220143834.270|20101220143835.938|TR0|excuse to go after wage earners, 
20101220143835.938|20101220143837.607|TR0|to go after systems like Social 
20101220143837.607|20101220143839.275|TR0|Security. I mean, one of the 
20101220143839.275|20101220143840.944|TR0|most pernicious things that 
20101220143840.944|20101220143842.612|TR0|Obama did in this tax bill was 
20101220143842.612|20101220143844.281|TR0|reduce contributions to Social 
20101220143844.281|20101220143845.949|TR0|Security, because of course 
20101220143845.949|20101220143847.618|TR0|that's next on the target, as 
20101220143847.618|20101220143849.287|TR0|well as raise the deficit by

20101220143852.624|20101220143854.292|TR0|And what's terrifying about 
20101220143854.292|20101220143855.961|TR0|movements like the Tea Party is 
20101220143855.961|20101220143857.629|TR0|that they provide a kind of 
20101220143857.629|20101220143859.298|TR0|emotional consistency. And, of 
20101220143859.298|20101220143900.966|TR0|course, that undercurrent of 
20101220143900.966|20101220143902.635|TR0|racism towards undocumented 
20101220143902.635|20101220143904.304|TR0|workers, towards Muslims, is 
20101220143904.304|20101220143905.972|TR0|very much a part of the language 
20101220143905.972|20101220143907.641|TR0|of that pernicious right wing. 
20101220143907.641|20101220143909.309|TR0|But it embraces all things 
20101220143909.309|20101220143910.978|TR0|military, as if somehow the 
20101220143910.978|20101220143912.646|TR0|military is not part of 
20101220143912.646|20101220143914.315|TR0|government. It's an irrational 
20101220143914.315|20101220143915.984|TR0|political policy. You know, 
20101220143915.984|20101220143917.652|TR0|nobody - they want to get 
20101220143917.652|20101220143919.321|TR0|government off their backs, but 
20101220143919.321|20101220143920.989|TR0|nobody - everybody wants to 
20101220143920.989|20101220143922.658|TR0|extend unemployment benefits, 
20101220143922.658|20101220143924.326|TR0|Social Security, Medicare, and 
20101220143924.326|20101220143925.995|TR0|of course not touch the big - 
20101220143925.995|20101220143927.663|TR0|you know, the force that is 
20101220143927.663|20101220143929.332|TR0|draining the - hollowing the 
20101220143929.332|20101220143931.001|TR0|country out from the inside, 
20101220143931.001|20101220143932.669|TR0|which is the military-industrial 
20101220143932.669|20101220143934.338|TR0|complex - 50 percent of all 
20101220143934.338|20101220143936.006|TR0|discretionary spending. And so, 
20101220143936.006|20101220143937.675|TR0|as these deficits - we've now 
20101220143937.675|20101220143939.343|TR0|racked up the largest deficits 
20101220143939.343|20101220143941.012|TR0|in human history, and as these 
20101220143941.012|20101220143942.680|TR0|deficits are ratcheted upwards, 
20101220143942.680|20101220143944.349|TR0|and there is an inability to 
20101220143944.349|20101220143946.018|TR0|question the self-destructive 
20101220143946.018|20101220143947.686|TR0|quality of the armament

20101220143951.023|20101220143952.692|TR0|and our working class is already

20101220144026.063|20101220144027.732|TR0|poster child for the bankruptcy 
20101220144027.732|20101220144029.400|TR0|of the liberal class. Somebody 
20101220144029.400|20101220144031.069|TR0|who, like Clinton, is a 
20101220144031.069|20101220144032.737|TR0|self-identified liberal, who 
20101220144032.737|20101220144034.406|TR0|speaks in the traditional 
20101220144034.406|20101220144036.074|TR0|language of liberalism but has 
20101220144036.074|20101220144037.743|TR0|made war against the core values 
20101220144037.743|20101220144039.412|TR0|of liberalism, which is a 
20101220144039.412|20101220144041.080|TR0|concern for those people outside 
20101220144041.080|20101220144042.749|TR0|the narrow power elite. And the 
20101220144042.749|20101220144044.417|TR0|tragedy, if tragedy is the right 
20101220144044.417|20101220144046.086|TR0|word, is that Obama, who made 
20101220144046.086|20101220144047.754|TR0|this Faustian bargain with 
20101220144047.754|20101220144049.423|TR0|corporate interests in order to 
20101220144049.423|20101220144051.091|TR0|gain power, has now been 
20101220144051.091|20101220144052.760|TR0|crumpled up and thrown away by 
20101220144052.760|20101220144054.429|TR0|these interests. They don't need 
20101220144054.429|20101220144056.097|TR0|him anymore. He functioned as a 
20101220144056.097|20101220144057.766|TR0|brand after the disastrous eight

20101220144101.103|20101220144102.771|TR0|And what we are watching is an 
20101220144102.771|20101220144104.440|TR0|even more craven attempt on the 
20101220144104.440|20101220144106.108|TR0|part of the White House to cater

20101220144111.114|20101220144112.783|TR0|reconfiguring this country into 
20101220144112.783|20101220144114.451|TR0|a form of neofeudalism. And all 
20101220144114.451|20101220144116.120|TR0|of the traditional - the pillars 
20101220144116.120|20101220144117.788|TR0|of the liberal establishment, 
20101220144117.788|20101220144119.457|TR0|that once provided some kind of 
20101220144119.457|20101220144121.126|TR0|protection and, more 
20101220144121.126|20101220144122.794|TR0|importantly, a kind of safety 
20101220144122.794|20101220144124.463|TR0|valve, a mechanism by which 
20101220144124.463|20101220144126.131|TR0|legitimate grievances and 
20101220144126.131|20101220144127.800|TR0|injustices in this country could

20101220144129.468|20101220144131.137|TR0|They no longer work. And so, we 
20101220144131.137|20101220144132.805|TR0|are getting these terrifying, 
20101220144132.805|20101220144134.474|TR0|proto-fascist movements that are 
20101220144134.474|20101220144136.143|TR0|leaping up around the fringes of 
20101220144136.143|20101220144137.811|TR0|American society and have as 
20101220144137.811|20101220144139.480|TR0|their anger not only a rage 
20101220144139.480|20101220144141.148|TR0|against government, but a rage 
20101220144141.148|20101220144142.817|TR0|against liberals, as well. And I 
20101220144142.817|20101220144144.485|TR0|would say that rage is not

20101220144201.171|20101220144202.840|TR0|All we have left are acts of 
20101220144202.840|20101220144204.508|TR0|physical resistance. Of course, 
20101220144204.508|20101220144206.177|TR0|I'm deeply nonviolent. And if we 
20101220144206.177|20101220144207.845|TR0|don't get out, then we're 
20101220144207.845|20101220144209.514|TR0|finished. To trust in the normal 
20101220144209.514|20101220144211.182|TR0|mechanisms of power and those

20101220144316.256|20101220144317.925|TR0|allegations are based on a 
20101220144317.925|20101220144319.593|TR0|10-day period in August when 
20101220144319.593|20101220144321.262|TR0|Assange was visiting Stockholm, 
20101220144321.262|20101220144322.930|TR0|during which he had sexual 
20101220144322.930|20101220144324.599|TR0|relations with two women that 
20101220144324.599|20101220144326.268|TR0|started out as consensual, but 
20101220144326.268|20101220144327.936|TR0|the women say they turned into 
20101220144327.936|20101220144329.605|TR0|assaults. The Guardian reports 
20101220144329.605|20101220144331.273|TR0|one woman told police that 
20101220144331.273|20101220144332.942|TR0|Assange pulled her clothes off 
20101220144332.942|20101220144334.610|TR0|and snapped her necklace. Then, 
20101220144334.610|20101220144336.279|TR0|she said, he held down her arms 
20101220144336.279|20101220144337.947|TR0|and legs and prevented her from 
20101220144337.947|20101220144339.616|TR0|grabbing a condom numerous 
20101220144339.616|20101220144341.285|TR0|times. After he let go and 
20101220144341.285|20101220144342.953|TR0|agreed to wear a condom, she 
20101220144342.953|20101220144344.622|TR0|claims, he did something to the 
20101220144344.622|20101220144346.290|TR0|condom to rip it. Assange denied 
20101220144346.290|20101220144347.959|TR0|the allegations, telling police 
20101220144347.959|20101220144349.627|TR0|he did not tear the condom and 
20101220144349.627|20101220144351.296|TR0|that the woman had allowed him 
20101220144351.296|20101220144352.964|TR0|to sleep in her bed for the 
20101220144352.964|20101220144354.633|TR0|following week. The other woman 
20101220144354.633|20101220144356.302|TR0|in the case told police Assange 
20101220144356.302|20101220144357.970|TR0|had sex with her while she was 
20101220144357.970|20101220144359.639|TR0|asleep, without using a condom.

20101220144401.307|20101220144402.976|TR0|On August 20th, the women went 
20101220144402.976|20101220144404.644|TR0|to Stockholm police. They had 
20101220144404.644|20101220144406.313|TR0|not decided whether to report 
20101220144406.313|20101220144407.982|TR0|Assange's behavior as a crime, 
20101220144407.982|20101220144409.650|TR0|but the prosecutor on duty that

20101220144414.656|20101220144416.324|TR0|supporters have said the case 
20101220144416.324|20101220144417.993|TR0|against him is part of a wider

20101220144438.016|20101220144439.684|TR0|a very successful smear campaign 
20101220144439.684|20101220144441.353|TR0|so far, but I think its days are 
20101220144441.353|20101220144443.021|TR0|numbered, and people are 
20101220144443.021|20101220144444.690|TR0|starting to wonder, is what is 
20101220144444.690|20101220144446.358|TR0|claimed really true, and if it 
20101220144446.358|20101220144448.027|TR0|is true, where is the evidence? 
20101220144448.027|20101220144449.696|TR0|Why has no evidence been

20101220144459.707|20101220144501.375|TR0|allegations against Assange are 
20101220144501.375|20101220144503.044|TR0|part of a political conspiracy.

20101220144506.381|20101220144508.050|TR0|think it's very, very 
20101220144508.050|20101220144509.718|TR0|unfortunate for my two clients 
20101220144509.718|20101220144511.387|TR0|that they were molested in some 
20101220144511.387|20101220144513.055|TR0|way or another by a person like 
20101220144513.055|20101220144514.724|TR0|Julian Assange, because what has 
20101220144514.724|20101220144516.392|TR0|happened afterwards is not that 
20101220144516.392|20101220144518.061|TR0|they will have a fair chance at 
20101220144518.061|20101220144519.730|TR0|this moment, because they are 
20101220144519.730|20101220144521.398|TR0|sort of being treated like the 
20101220144521.398|20101220144523.067|TR0|perpetrators themselves and they 
20101220144523.067|20101220144524.735|TR0|have - there is a conspiracy and 
20101220144524.735|20101220144526.404|TR0|all that nonsense. So it's very, 
20101220144526.404|20101220144528.072|TR0|very unfortunate.

20101220144604.781|20101220144606.449|TR0|you talk about your thoughts on 
20101220144606.449|20101220144608.118|TR0|the - we can't even say charges 
20101220144608.118|20101220144609.786|TR0|against Julian Assange, because

20101220144614.792|20101220144616.461|TR0|allegations. Certainly these 
20101220144616.461|20101220144618.129|TR0|women are alleging a crime.
20101220144618.129|20101220144619.798|TR0|
20101220144619.798|20101220144621.466|TR0|What I want to say is that these 
20101220144621.466|20101220144623.135|TR0|are - the details, certainly, 
20101220144623.135|20101220144624.803|TR0|have become more clear since 
20101220144624.803|20101220144626.472|TR0|that unauthorized leak, but 
20101220144626.472|20101220144628.141|TR0|we've known those basic facts 
20101220144628.141|20101220144629.809|TR0|for weeks, that the allegations 
20101220144629.809|20101220144631.478|TR0|- in fact, we've known them 
20101220144631.478|20101220144633.146|TR0|since August, that the 
20101220144633.146|20101220144634.815|TR0|allegations were that he held 
20101220144634.815|20101220144636.483|TR0|one woman down, that he raped 
20101220144636.483|20101220144638.152|TR0|another in her sleep. These 
20101220144638.152|20101220144639.820|TR0|allegations have been out there. 
20101220144639.820|20101220144641.489|TR0|The Guardian has been reporting 
20101220144641.489|20101220144643.158|TR0|them.
20101220144643.158|20101220144644.826|TR0|
20101220144644.826|20101220144646.495|TR0|Rape is a very serious crime, 
20101220144646.495|20101220144648.163|TR0|and it's also one of the most 
20101220144648.163|20101220144649.832|TR0|underreported crimes across the 
20101220144649.832|20101220144651.500|TR0|globe. And one of the reasons is 
20101220144651.500|20101220144653.169|TR0|because every time the issue 
20101220144653.169|20101220144654.838|TR0|comes up in the media, people 
20101220144654.838|20101220144656.506|TR0|come out of the woodwork to 
20101220144656.506|20101220144658.175|TR0|blame the victims and to 
20101220144658.175|20101220144659.843|TR0|minimize the crime. And 
20101220144659.843|20101220144701.512|TR0|unfortunately, when we see 
20101220144701.512|20101220144703.180|TR0|someone who is a progressive 
20101220144703.180|20101220144704.849|TR0|hero, like Assange is, those 
20101220144704.849|20101220144706.517|TR0|critics, those people who are 
20101220144706.517|20101220144708.186|TR0|doing that minimization and that 
20101220144708.186|20101220144709.855|TR0|victim blaming often come from 
20101220144709.855|20101220144711.523|TR0|the left, as well as the right. 
20101220144711.523|20101220144713.192|TR0|And we've seen that across the 
20101220144713.192|20101220144714.860|TR0|board. Unfortunately, with - 
20101220144714.860|20101220144716.529|TR0|Naomi Wolf has participated in 
20101220144716.529|20101220144718.197|TR0|that, as well as Michael Moore, 
20101220144718.197|20101220144719.866|TR0|Keith Olbermann, Glenn Beck - of 
20101220144719.866|20101220144721.534|TR0|course, plenty of people on the 
20101220144721.534|20101220144723.203|TR0|right are participating, as well.
20101220144723.203|20101220144724.872|TR0|
20101220144724.872|20101220144726.540|TR0|And the result of that is not 
20101220144726.540|20101220144728.209|TR0|only that these women are 
20101220144728.209|20101220144729.877|TR0|receiving death threats, they 
20101220144729.877|20101220144731.546|TR0|are in hiding - one of them has 
20101220144731.546|20101220144733.214|TR0|gone to Palestine, because she 
20101220144733.214|20101220144734.883|TR0|couldn't feel safe in Sweden 
20101220144734.883|20101220144736.552|TR0|anymore - but the even more 
20101220144736.552|20101220144738.220|TR0|important result of that, when 
20101220144738.220|20101220144739.889|TR0|we perpetuate rape myths in the 
20101220144739.889|20101220144741.557|TR0|media - and this is not just my 
20101220144741.557|20101220144743.226|TR0|opinion, this has been 
20101220144743.226|20101220144744.894|TR0|documented by social research - 
20101220144744.894|20101220144746.563|TR0|is that victims, nameless 
20101220144746.563|20101220144748.231|TR0|victims, victims who have been 
20101220144748.231|20101220144749.900|TR0|harmed by people who are not 
20101220144749.900|20101220144751.569|TR0|famous, become much more 
20101220144751.569|20101220144753.237|TR0|reluctant to take their 
20101220144753.237|20101220144754.906|TR0|experiences seriously, to report 
20101220144754.906|20101220144756.574|TR0|those experiences. The system, 
20101220144756.574|20101220144758.243|TR0|the justice system that's 
20101220144758.243|20101220144759.911|TR0|supposed to work for those 
20101220144759.911|20101220144801.580|TR0|victims - the cops, the juries, 
20101220144801.580|20101220144803.248|TR0|the prosecutors, the judges - 
20101220144803.248|20101220144804.917|TR0|they become much more reluctant 
20101220144804.917|20101220144806.586|TR0|to take these allegations 
20101220144806.586|20101220144808.254|TR0|seriously when they are 
20101220144808.254|20101220144809.923|TR0|reported. And men become less 
20101220144809.923|20101220144811.591|TR0|likely to identify their own 
20101220144811.591|20101220144813.260|TR0|behavior as sexually violent. 
20101220144813.260|20101220144814.928|TR0|And the result of all of that is 
20101220144814.928|20101220144816.597|TR0|that rapists go free.
20101220144816.597|20101220144818.266|TR0|
20101220144818.266|20101220144819.934|TR0|And what we know about that is, 
20101220144819.934|20101220144821.603|TR0|the majority of rapists are 
20101220144821.603|20101220144823.271|TR0|repeat rapists. So, the result 
20101220144823.271|20101220144824.940|TR0|of perpetuating these rape myths 
20101220144824.940|20101220144826.608|TR0|in the mass media is that we 
20101220144826.608|20101220144828.277|TR0|literally are creating more rape 
20101220144828.277|20101220144829.945|TR0|in the world. And that's my main 
20101220144829.945|20101220144831.614|TR0|concern about the way these 
20101220144831.614|20101220144833.283|TR0|allegations have been discussed 
20101220144833.283|20101220144834.951|TR0|so far, is that it's doing real 
20101220144834.951|20101220144836.620|TR0|harm to real women around the 
20101220144836.620|20101220144838.288|TR0|world who have nothing to do 
20101220144838.288|20101220144839.957|TR0|with this case.

20101220144848.300|20101220144849.968|TR0|Jaclyn, let me say that I'm 
20101220144849.968|20101220144851.637|TR0|very, very offended that you're 
20101220144851.637|20101220144853.305|TR0|suggesting that I'm blaming the 
20101220144853.305|20101220144854.974|TR0|victim. In fact, it's because of 
20101220144854.974|20101220144856.642|TR0|my 23 years of supporting rape 
20101220144856.642|20101220144858.311|TR0|victims, working in rape crisis 
20101220144858.311|20101220144859.980|TR0|centers, traveling around the 
20101220144859.980|20101220144901.648|TR0|world, to report more than any 
20101220144901.648|20101220144903.317|TR0|journalist I know, which, in a 
20101220144903.317|20101220144904.985|TR0|way, I've been very blessed to 
20101220144904.985|20101220144906.654|TR0|have had the chance to do so, 
20101220144906.654|20101220144908.322|TR0|from Sierra Leone to Bosnia to 
20101220144908.322|20101220144909.991|TR0|Ireland to the United Kingdom, 
20101220144909.991|20101220144911.659|TR0|interviewing people who support 
20101220144911.659|20101220144913.328|TR0|rape victims and work with the 
20101220144913.328|20101220144914.997|TR0|legal system - it's because of 
20101220144914.997|20101220144916.665|TR0|that that I'm raising my voice 
20101220144916.665|20101220144918.334|TR0|about these very ambiguous and 
20101220144918.334|20101220144920.002|TR0|corrupt allegations.
20101220144920.002|20101220144921.671|TR0|
20101220144921.671|20101220144923.339|TR0|First of all, let me just 
20101220144923.339|20101220144925.008|TR0|correct you. And Jaclyn, these - 
20101220144925.008|20101220144926.676|TR0|The Guardian account, which is 
20101220144926.676|20101220144928.345|TR0|based on leaked original 
20101220144928.345|20101220144930.014|TR0|documents, doesn't say that he 
20101220144930.014|20101220144931.682|TR0|had sex with either of these 
20101220144931.682|20101220144933.351|TR0|women without the consent. The 
20101220144933.351|20101220144935.019|TR0|reason I'm hearing from rape 
20101220144935.019|20101220144936.688|TR0|victims across the world who are 
20101220144936.688|20101220144938.356|TR0|emailing me, saying, "I'm a rape 
20101220144938.356|20101220144940.025|TR0|victim. Thank you for standing 
20101220144940.025|20101220144941.694|TR0|up to put these charges in 
20101220144941.694|20101220144943.362|TR0|context," is that this is the 
20101220144943.362|20101220144945.031|TR0|only case I've ever seen in 23 
20101220144945.031|20101220144946.699|TR0|years of supporting rape victims 
20101220144946.699|20101220144948.368|TR0|which is based on multiple 
20101220144948.368|20101220144950.036|TR0|instances of consent.
20101220144950.036|20101220144951.705|TR0|
20101220144951.705|20101220144953.373|TR0|If you read these allegations, 
20101220144953.373|20101220144955.042|TR0|he took off Miss A's clothes too 
20101220144955.042|20101220144956.711|TR0|quickly for her comfort. She 
20101220144956.711|20101220144958.379|TR0|tried to tell him to slow down, 
20101220144958.379|20101220145000.048|TR0|but then, quote, "she allowed 
20101220145000.048|20101220145001.716|TR0|him to undress her." This is 
20101220145001.716|20101220145003.385|TR0|what the report says. The second 
20101220145003.385|20101220145005.053|TR0|woman says she woke to find him 
20101220145005.053|20101220145006.722|TR0|having sex with her. When she 
20101220145006.722|20101220145008.390|TR0|asked whether he was wearing a 
20101220145008.390|20101220145010.059|TR0|condom, he said no. Quote, 
20101220145010.059|20101220145011.728|TR0|"According to her statement, she 
20101220145011.728|20101220145013.396|TR0|said: 'You better not have 
20101220145013.396|20101220145015.065|TR0|HIV.'" He answered, "Of course 
20101220145015.065|20101220145016.733|TR0|not." Quote, "She couldn't be 
20101220145016.733|20101220145018.402|TR0|bothered to tell him one more 
20101220145018.402|20101220145020.070|TR0|time because she had been going 
20101220145020.070|20101220145021.739|TR0|on about the condom all night. 
20101220145021.739|20101220145023.408|TR0|She had never had unprotected 
20101220145023.408|20101220145025.076|TR0|sex before."
20101220145025.076|20101220145026.745|TR0|
20101220145026.745|20101220145028.413|TR0|So, if you're going to treat 
20101220145028.413|20101220145030.082|TR0|women as moral adults and if 
20101220145030.082|20101220145031.750|TR0|you're going to take the issue 
20101220145031.750|20101220145033.419|TR0|of rape seriously, the person 
20101220145033.419|20101220145035.087|TR0|who's engaging in what he thinks 
20101220145035.087|20101220145036.756|TR0|is consensual sex has to be 
20101220145036.756|20101220145038.425|TR0|told, "I don't want this." And 
20101220145038.425|20101220145040.093|TR0|again and again and again, these 
20101220145040.093|20101220145041.762|TR0|women did not say, "This is not 
20101220145041.762|20101220145043.430|TR0|consensual." Assange was shocked 
20101220145043.430|20101220145045.099|TR0|when these were brought up as 
20101220145045.099|20101220145046.767|TR0|complaints, because he had no 
20101220145046.767|20101220145048.436|TR0|idea that this was not a 
20101220145048.436|20101220145050.104|TR0|consensual situation. Miss A 
20101220145050.104|20101220145051.773|TR0|kept Assange in her home for the 
20101220145051.773|20101220145053.442|TR0|next four days and threw a party 
20101220145053.442|20101220145055.110|TR0|for him.
20101220145055.110|20101220145056.779|TR0|
20101220145056.779|20101220145058.447|TR0|So, because I take rape 
20101220145058.447|20101220145100.116|TR0|seriously, because I'm aware 
20101220145100.116|20101220145101.784|TR0|that in 23 years, you know, in 
20101220145101.784|20101220145103.453|TR0|Sweden, which has been 
20101220145103.453|20101220145105.122|TR0|criticized by Amnesty 
20101220145105.122|20101220145106.790|TR0|International for disregarding 
20101220145106.790|20101220145108.459|TR0|rape, for letting rapists go 
20101220145108.459|20101220145110.127|TR0|free, because you have a better 
20101220145110.127|20101220145111.796|TR0|chance in Sweden, if you're a 
20101220145111.796|20101220145113.464|TR0|rape victim, of, you know, dying 
20101220145113.464|20101220145115.133|TR0|in an accident or getting breast 
20101220145115.133|20101220145116.801|TR0|cancer than having a serious 
20101220145116.801|20101220145118.470|TR0|rape allegation prosecuted or 
20101220145118.470|20101220145120.139|TR0|getting any kind of legal 
20101220145120.139|20101220145121.807|TR0|hearing, according to Amnesty 
20101220145121.807|20101220145123.476|TR0|International's report "Case 
20101220145123.476|20101220145125.144|TR0|Closed" - it's because of that 
20101220145125.144|20101220145126.813|TR0|that I know that these charges 
20101220145126.813|20101220145128.481|TR0|are utterly, utterly atypically 
20101220145128.481|20101220145130.150|TR0|handled. In 23 years, I've never 
20101220145130.150|20101220145131.818|TR0|seen any man in any situation 
20101220145131.818|20101220145133.487|TR0|this ambiguous, involving this 
20101220145133.487|20101220145135.156|TR0|much consent, have any kind of 
20101220145135.156|20101220145136.824|TR0|legal process whatsoever. And 
20101220145136.824|20101220145138.493|TR0|all over the world, women who 
20101220145138.493|20101220145140.161|TR0|have been gang-raped, brutally 
20101220145140.161|20101220145141.830|TR0|raped, raped in alleyways, 
20101220145141.830|20101220145143.498|TR0|pimped, prostituted, trafficked, 
20101220145143.498|20101220145145.167|TR0|you know, their rapists go free.
20101220145145.167|20101220145146.836|TR0|
20101220145146.836|20101220145148.504|TR0|So, yes, this stinks to me. And 
20101220145148.504|20101220145150.173|TR0|yes, it's about politics, and 
20101220145150.173|20101220145151.841|TR0|it's about the same kind of 
20101220145151.841|20101220145153.510|TR0|politics that dragged you, when 
20101220145153.510|20101220145155.178|TR0|you were trying to cover a 
20101220145155.178|20101220145156.847|TR0|march, you know, violently into 
20101220145156.847|20101220145158.515|TR0|legal jeopardy, because really 
20101220145158.515|20101220145200.184|TR0|this is about a journalist who 
20101220145200.184|20101220145201.853|TR0|has angered the most powerful 
20101220145201.853|20101220145203.521|TR0|and increasingly brutal nation 
20101220145203.521|20101220145205.190|TR0|on earth, and it's about all of 
20101220145205.190|20101220145206.858|TR0|us who are journalists being 
20101220145206.858|20101220145208.527|TR0|dragged into a dangerous 
20101220145208.527|20101220145210.195|TR0|situation because of criticism 
20101220145210.195|20101220145211.864|TR0|of the government.
20101220145211.864|20101220145213.532|TR0|

20101220145218.538|20101220145220.207|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: Wow. First 
20101220145220.207|20101220145221.875|TR0|of all, I've also been working 
20101220145221.875|20101220145223.544|TR0|with rape survivors for 20 
20101220145223.544|20101220145225.212|TR0|years, and I am one myself. And 
20101220145225.212|20101220145226.881|TR0|I can assure you that you do not 
20101220145226.881|20101220145228.550|TR0|speak for me or many of us. I, 
20101220145228.550|20101220145230.218|TR0|too, have been speaking with 
20101220145230.218|20101220145231.887|TR0|rape survivors around the world 
20101220145231.887|20101220145233.555|TR0|since this case broke, who have 
20101220145233.555|20101220145235.224|TR0|been so hurt and disappointed 
20101220145235.224|20101220145236.892|TR0|that someone like you, who 
20101220145236.892|20101220145238.561|TR0|understands about the danger of 
20101220145238.561|20101220145240.229|TR0|perpetuating myths in the media, 
20101220145240.229|20101220145241.898|TR0|would be perpetuating rape myths 
20101220145241.898|20101220145243.567|TR0|that hurt all of us. There are 
20101220145243.567|20101220145245.235|TR0|so many rape survivors that are 
20101220145245.235|20101220145246.904|TR0|up in arms about the way this 
20101220145246.904|20101220145248.572|TR0|case has been discussed and the 
20101220145248.572|20101220145250.241|TR0|way these women have been

20101220145420.343|20101220145422.012|TR0|these issues seriously. This is 
20101220145422.012|20101220145423.680|TR0|an opportunity to set the

20101220145750.582|20101220145752.250|TR0|>> JACLYN FRIEDMAN: She was 
20101220145752.250|20101220145753.919|TR0|afraid. He had held her down. 
20101220145753.919|20101220145755.587|TR0|She was in a state of fear. 
20101220145755.587|20101220145757.256|TR0|Many, many women - this happens 
20101220145757.256|20101220145758.924|TR0|over - you talk to rape 
20101220145758.924|20101220145800.593|TR0|survivors. I can't believe you 
20101220145800.593|20101220145802.262|TR0|don't know this. Many women are 
20101220145802.262|20101220145803.930|TR0|in a state of fear and unable -

20101220145805.599|20101220145807.267|TR0|This is so common as to be 
20101220145807.267|20101220145808.936|TR0|laughable. And the reason they 
20101220145808.936|20101220145810.604|TR0|don't take these seriously is 
20101220145810.604|20101220145812.273|TR0|because you tell them that.

20101220145828.958|20101220145830.627|TR0|say is if a man or a woman who's 
20101220145830.627|20101220145832.296|TR0|engaging in a sexual act that 
20101220145832.296|20101220145833.964|TR0|they think is consensual never
