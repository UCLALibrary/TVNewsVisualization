20101220020608.099|20101220020611.903|CC1|BUT I LIKED IT.
20101220020612.036|20101220020613.004|CC1|AND IT'S FROM THE HEART, AND
20101220020613.137|20101220020614.372|CC1|IT'S HOW HE FEELS AND WHY HE
20101220020614.505|20101220020615.473|CC1|MADE TOUGH DECISIONS AND HOW HE
20101220020615.606|20101220020616.407|CC1|MADE THEM.

20101220020622.280|20101220020625.583|CC1|AND HE'S NOT TRYING TO WRITE A

20101220020627.852|20101220020628.653|CC1|TELL HOW IT IS IN THE WHITE
20101220020628.786|20101220020631.055|CC1|HOUSE.

20101220020640.464|20101220020641.899|CC1|AND IT MADE ME SO MAD THAT HE

20101220024554.279|20101220024554.880|CC1|SAID, THAT THEY WEREN'T FOUND IN
20101220024555.014|20101220024555.547|CC1|BIG NUMBERS OR FOUND AT ALL.
20101220024555.681|20101220024556.281|CC1|BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE
20101220024556.415|20101220024559.752|CC1|MISSION ITSELF ISN'T WORTHWHILE.
20101220024559.885|20101220024600.486|CC1|>> Larry: DO YOU THINK HISTORY
20101220024600.619|20101220024601.053|CC1|WILL BE KINDER TO HIM?
20101220024601.186|20101220024601.720|CC1|>> YES, DEFINITELY.
20101220024601.854|20101220024602.488|CC1|HISTORY WILL BE KIND TO HIM
20101220024602.621|20101220024603.288|CC1|BECAUSE HE'S A MAN OF PRINCIPLE,
20101220024603.422|20101220024604.957|CC1|DID WHAT HE SAID HE'S GOING TO
20101220024605.090|20101220024606.325|CC1|DO, KEPT OUR COUNTRY SAFE IN THE
20101220024606.458|20101220024607.693|CC1|FIRST TIME WE WERE REALLY
20101220024607.826|20101220024609.428|CC1|ATTACKED ON THAT 9/11.
20101220024609.561|20101220024610.295|CC1|AND THAT IN ITSELF --
20101220024610.429|20101220024611.196|CC1|>> Larry: HE SAYS HE DOESN'T
20101220024611.330|20101220024614.800|CC1|THINK ABOUT HISTORY MUCH.
20101220024614.933|20101220024615.467|CC1|HE SAYS HISTORY WILL DECIDE.
20101220024615.601|20101220024617.036|CC1|DO YOU THINK ABOUT HISTORY MUCH?
20101220024617.169|20101220024617.503|CC1|>> FOR HIM?
20101220024617.636|20101220024618.270|CC1|YEAH.
20101220024618.404|20101220024623.475|CC1|>> Larry: NO, FOR YOU.
20101220024623.609|20101220024624.309|CC1|>> LARRY, I'M TOO DARNED OLD.
20101220024624.443|20101220024625.144|CC1|I THINK JUST ABOUT HOW TO GET
20101220024625.277|20101220024627.746|CC1|HOME AND GO TO BED.
20101220024627.880|20101220024628.480|CC1|NO, I DON'T THINK ABOUT HISTORY,
20101220024628.614|20101220024629.481|CC1|AND I DON'T KEEP UP WITH EVENTS
20101220024629.615|20101220024633.118|CC1|LIKE I USED TO.
20101220024633.252|20101220024633.852|CC1|AND SO IT'S DIFFERENT NOW, VERY,
20101220024633.986|20101220024636.588|CC1|VERY DIFFERENT.
20101220024636.722|20101220024637.256|CC1|BUT HISTORY WILL BE KIND TO
20101220024637.389|20101220024638.557|CC1|GEORGE.
20101220024638.691|20101220024643.362|CC1|>> Larry: WE HAVE ANOTHER
20101220024643.495|20101220024646.632|CC1|MESSAGE FOR YOU, AND THIS IS
20101220024646.765|20101220024647.299|CC1|FROM YOUR DAUGHTER, DORO.

20101220024648.300|20101220024649.134|CC1|>> ONE THING YOU MAY KNOW ABOUT
20101220024649.268|20101220024653.906|CC1|MY DAD IS THAT HE JUMPS OUT OF
20101220024654.039|20101220024654.840|CC1|AIRPLANES.
20101220024654.974|20101220024655.574|CC1|ONE THING YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT
20101220024655.708|20101220024656.275|CC1|MY DAD IS THAT HE'S A WEDDING

20101220024704.683|20101220024707.619|CC1|HAPPY.
20101220024707.753|20101220024710.689|CC1|SO, MY DAD WILL GO DOWN THE
20101220024710.823|20101220024713.659|CC1|KENNEBUNK RIVER IN HIS BOAT AND
20101220024713.792|20101220024714.360|CC1|HE WILL SEE A BRIDE AND GROOM
20101220024714.493|20101220024715.094|CC1|ALONG THE SHORE HAVING A WEDDING
20101220024715.227|20101220024717.463|CC1|AT ONE OF THE MANY HOTELS IN

20101220024742.755|20101220024746.492|CC1|>> THAT'S GREAT.
20101220024746.625|20101220024747.192|CC1|>> Larry: SO, WE LEARNED
20101220024747.326|20101220024748.027|CC1|SOMETHING HERE.
20101220024748.160|20101220024749.328|CC1|>> THE LAST TIME I DID THAT WAS
20101220024749.461|20101220024750.429|CC1|WITH PHIL MICKELSON, GREAT
20101220024750.562|20101220024754.033|CC1|GOLFER AND GREAT FRIENDS OF

20101220024755.034|20101220024800.005|CC1|HE'S A GOOD GUY.
20101220024800.139|20101220024803.309|CC1|AND SO, I THINK WE WENT INTO
20101220024803.442|20101220024808.514|CC1|THIS WEDDING, AND ALL THE PEOPLE
20101220024808.647|20101220024809.148|CC1|CAME AROUND, AS DORO SAID.
20101220024809.281|20101220024812.451|CC1|I HAD THE FEELING THEY WERE
20101220024812.585|20101220024813.118|CC1|SAYING WHO IS THIS GUY WITH
20101220024813.252|20101220024813.419|CC1|PHIL.
20101220024813.552|20101220024813.919|CC1|LOOK AT ME.
20101220024814.053|20101220024814.653|CC1|I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG, BUT I
20101220024814.787|20101220024815.421|CC1|THINK SO.
20101220024815.554|20101220024816.055|CC1|HE'S A BIGGER THAN LIFE,
20101220024816.188|20101220024816.555|CC1|WONDERFUL PERSON.
20101220024816.689|20101220024817.289|CC1|>> Larry: BY THE WAY -- I KNOW
20101220024817.423|20101220024817.790|CC1|ABOUT THE CLINTON.
20101220024817.923|20101220024818.524|CC1|DID YOU GO TO CHELSEA CLINTON'S
20101220024818.657|20101220024818.857|CC1|WEDDING?
20101220024818.991|20101220024820.359|CC1|>> NO.
20101220024820.492|20101220024820.960|CC1|INTERESTING THING.
20101220024821.093|20101220024821.994|CC1|ABOUT TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE
20101220024822.127|20101220024823.963|CC1|THE WEDDING, WE'RE IN MAINE AND
20101220024824.096|20101220024824.663|CC1|WE GET A PHONE CALL FROM BILL
20101220024824.797|20101220024824.997|CC1|CLINTON.
20101220024825.130|20101220024825.731|CC1|NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WEDDING.
20101220024825.864|20101220024826.198|CC1|JUST HE'S BUSY.
20101220024826.332|20101220024826.932|CC1|HE JUST CALLED UP, HOW ARE YOU
20101220024827.066|20101220024827.566|CC1|DOING?
20101220024827.700|20101220024828.400|CC1|I HAVE A VERY GOOD PERSONAL
20101220024828.534|20101220024829.034|CC1|RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
20101220024829.168|20101220024832.571|CC1|>> Larry: I KNOW.
20101220024832.705|20101220024833.439|CC1|>> BUT, NO, WE WEREN'T INVITED,
20101220024833.572|20101220024839.211|CC1|NOR SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN.
20101220024839.345|20101220024839.745|CC1|>> WE WERE THRILLED.
20101220024839.879|20101220024840.412|CC1|THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.
20101220024840.546|20101220024841.013|CC1|JENNA'S WEDDING HAD NO
20101220024841.146|20101220024841.513|CC1|POLITICIANS, NONE.
20101220024841.647|20101220024842.147|CC1|THEY HAD FAMILY AND CLOSE
20101220024842.281|20101220024845.618|CC1|FRIENDS.
20101220024845.751|20101220024846.352|CC1|I THINK THAT'S WHAT BILL DID AND
20101220024846.485|20101220024848.053|CC1|HILLARY.
20101220024848.187|20101220024849.388|CC1|AND THAT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE
20101220024849.521|20101220024850.055|CC1|SHE'S -- SHE HAS A JOB AND
20101220024850.189|20101220024850.789|CC1|THEY'RE MUCH CLOSER TO POLITICS
20101220024850.923|20101220024851.657|CC1|THAN WE ARE.
20101220024851.790|20101220024853.926|CC1|>> Larry: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
20101220024854.059|20101220024854.927|CC1|HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH BILL?
20101220024855.060|20101220024856.629|CC1|>> I LIKED IT.
20101220024856.762|20101220024859.798|CC1|IT TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE, I
20101220024859.932|20101220024900.533|CC1|CONFESS, BUT YOU CAN'T DISLIKE
20101220024900.666|20101220024901.267|CC1|BILL CLINTON.
20101220024901.400|20101220024903.836|CC1|HE'S VERY LIKABLE.
20101220024903.969|20101220024904.803|CC1|AND HE WAS SO GOOD TO GEORGE.
20101220024904.937|20101220024907.907|CC1|GEORGE TOLD ME OVER AND OVER
20101220024908.040|20101220024908.641|CC1|AGAIN HE WOULD -- HE WOULD LET
20101220024908.774|20101220024909.375|CC1|GEORGE HAVE THE BED.
20101220024909.508|20101220024910.176|CC1|I MEAN --
20101220024910.309|20101220024911.877|CC1|>> WHEN WE TRAVELED.
20101220024912.011|20101220024913.212|CC1|>> I HAVE A FEELING THAT BILL
20101220024913.345|20101220024914.680|CC1|WISHES HE HAD A FATHER LIKE
20101220024914.813|20101220024916.282|CC1|GEORGE, TRUTHFULLY.
20101220024916.415|20101220024920.152|CC1|>> WE HAVE A CLOSE, FRIENDLY,
20101220024920.286|20101220024921.754|CC1|PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP, AND HE'S
20101220024921.887|20101220024922.488|CC1|BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY KIND TO ME.
20101220024922.621|20101220024923.155|CC1|>> GEORGE W. SAYS THE SAME
20101220024923.289|20101220024926.058|CC1|THING.
20101220024926.192|20101220024927.159|CC1|>> Larry: HE DOES?
20101220024927.293|20101220024927.793|CC1|THAT'S WELL SAID, THOUGH.
20101220024927.927|20101220024928.494|CC1|MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FATHER HE
20101220024928.627|20101220024929.895|CC1|NEVER HAD.
20101220024930.029|20101220024937.703|CC1|>> YOU KNOW WHAT BILL SAID WHEN
20101220024937.837|20101220024938.404|CC1|I CALLED HIM "MY BOY, BILL,"
20101220024938.537|20101220024939.038|CC1|WHEN I INTRODUCED HIM AT
20101220024939.171|20101220024939.705|CC1|SOMETHING JUST BEING FUNNY.
20101220024939.839|20101220024940.406|CC1|HE SAID, THOSE BUSHES WILL DO
20101220024940.539|20101220024941.006|CC1|ANYTHING TO GET ANOTHER
20101220024941.140|20101220024941.707|CC1|PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
20101220024941.841|20101220025234.247|CC1|>> Larry: WE'LL BE BACK.
20101220025234.380|20101220025236.849|CC1|>> Larry: A LETTER TO PRESIDENT

20101220025458.091|20101220025500.259|CC1|AS I HAD TAKEN THE HELM OF THE

20101220025516.442|20101220025518.344|CC1|I WENT TO MY BEDROOM, AND I
20101220025518.478|20101220025520.146|CC1|FOUND A NOTE WHICH I WILL ALWAYS

20101220025524.050|20101220025526.619|CC1|PIERCE, AND IT SAID, PIERCE, I
20101220025526.753|20101220025528.555|CC1|REMEMBER DAYS WHEN I FELT COULD
20101220025528.688|20101220025529.522|CC1|I DO NOTHING RIGHT, BUT THEN THE
20101220025529.656|20101220025530.924|CC1|SUN WOULD COME UP AND A BRIGHT
