20101220153221.508|20101220153223.577|CC1|BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT
20101220153223.711|20101220153227.181|CC1|IT, 50% OF AMERICANS SAID IN THE
20101220153227.314|20101220153231.051|CC1|'30s, THEY EXPECTED BUSINESS TO
20101220153231.185|20101220153232.519|CC1|IMPROVE IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.
20101220153232.653|20101220153233.720|CC1|IF YOU ASKED AMERICANS IN
20101220153233.854|20101220153235.589|CC1|OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR, THEY SAID
20101220153235.722|20101220153237.958|CC1|THAT ONLY 35% WERE HOPEFUL ON
20101220153238.091|20101220153240.027|CC1|THE SAME FRONT AND 16% SAW THE
20101220153240.160|20101220153241.895|CC1|ECONOMY ACTUALLY GETTING WORSE.
20101220153242.029|20101220153243.196|CC1|THIS IS SO INTERESTING.
20101220153243.330|20101220153245.332|CC1|SOMETHING TELLS ME, NO, IT WAS
20101220153245.465|20101220153246.933|CC1|SO MUCH HARDER FOR THE AMERICANS
20101220153247.067|20101220153248.802|CC1|LIVING AROUND THE GREAT
20101220153248.935|20101220153249.236|CC1|DEPRESSION.
20101220153249.369|20101220153251.471|CC1|>> DURING THE GREAT RECESSION,
20101220153251.605|20101220153254.107|CC1|SOME SAY WE DIDN'T GET THROUGH
20101220153254.241|20101220153255.509|CC1|IT, BUT ANY WAY, WE'RE NOT GOING
20101220153255.642|20101220153257.043|CC1|TO DEBATE THAT.
20101220153257.177|20101220153300.580|CC1|PRETTY ANGRY ABOUT THE BIG ROLE
20101220153300.714|20101220153301.114|CC1|THAT GOVERNMENT HAD.
20101220153301.248|20101220153303.783|CC1|HOW WAS IT BACK IN THE 1930s?
20101220153303.917|20101220153305.919|CC1|>> THIS MAY SURPRISE A LOT OF
20101220153306.052|20101220153307.721|CC1|PEOPLE BECAUSE IN THE '30s,
20101220153307.854|20101220153309.122|CC1|PEOPLE WANTED GOVERNMENT TO DO
20101220153309.256|20101220153310.924|CC1|MORE TO HELP OUT TO GET THE
20101220153311.057|20101220153312.892|CC1|ECONOMY ROLLING AGAIN AND THEY
20101220153313.026|20101220153313.760|CC1|THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HELP OUT
20101220153313.893|20101220153314.861|CC1|AMERICANS WHO ARE IN PAIN.
20101220153314.995|20101220153316.496|CC1|TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE
20101220153316.630|20101220153318.865|CC1|NUMBERS WE HAVE HERE.
20101220153318.999|20101220153321.234|CC1|AS FAR AS PROVIDING FREE MEDICAL
20101220153321.368|20101220153322.802|CC1|CARE FOR THE POOR, 76% OF THE
20101220153322.936|20101220153324.571|CC1|PEOPLE SUPPORTED THAT.
20101220153324.704|20101220153326.206|CC1|THEY HAD 73% OF AMERICANS
20101220153326.339|20101220153333.246|CC1|PROVIDING FARMER'S LOANS ON AN
20101220153333.379|20101220153333.646|CC1|EASY BASIS.
20101220153333.780|20101220153334.380|CC1|MEANS TEN FAERMS COULD WORK TO
20101220153334.514|20101220153338.885|CC1|BUY THE FARMS THAT WERE USING.
20101220153339.018|20101220153339.586|CC1|THEY FAVORED SOCIAL SECURITY
20101220153339.719|20101220153341.888|CC1|PROGRAMS BY 64%.
20101220153342.021|20101220153345.458|CC1|THERE WERE SO SOCIALIST TENDTIES
20101220153345.591|20101220153345.825|CC1|ABOUNDING.
20101220153345.959|20101220153346.526|CC1|IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT
20101220153346.659|20101220153347.894|CC1|BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH ANGER
20101220153348.027|20101220153350.029|CC1|ABOUT HOW MUCH SHOULD GOVERNMENT
20101220153350.163|20101220153350.430|CC1|BE INVOLVED.
20101220153350.563|20101220153352.231|CC1|A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS STILL
20101220153352.365|20101220153354.267|CC1|STAND TO THIS DAY AND REALLY DID
20101220153354.400|20101220153358.671|CC1|HELP GET THE ECONOMY GOING.
20101220153358.805|20101220153400.840|CC1|TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS THAT
20101220153400.973|20101220153401.908|CC1|THERE'S MAYBE BLEND.
20101220153402.041|20101220153403.776|CC1|YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE YOUR FAITH IN
20101220153403.910|20101220153405.745|CC1|COUNTRY, BUT ALSO SOME SAY DON'T
20101220153405.878|20101220153407.647|CC1|DO TOO MUCH, BUT FIND THAT
20101220153407.780|20101220153409.749|CC1|LITTLE BALANCE.
