20101231140024.552|20101231140026.829|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: 2010 can be 
20101231140026.829|20101231140029.105|TR0|defined as the year of 
20101231140029.105|20101231140031.382|TR0|WikiLeaks. The whistleblowing 
20101231140031.382|20101231140033.658|TR0|website first made headlines 
20101231140033.658|20101231140035.935|TR0|around the world in April when 
20101231140035.935|20101231140038.211|TR0|it released a video of a U.S. 
20101231140038.211|20101231140040.488|TR0|helicopter gunship 
20101231140040.488|20101231140042.764|TR0|indiscriminately firing on Iraqi 
20101231140042.764|20101231140045.041|TR0|civilians, killing 12 people, 
20101231140045.041|20101231140047.317|TR0|including two Reuters news 
20101231140047.317|20101231140049.594|TR0|staff. In July, WikiLeaks 
20101231140049.594|20101231140051.870|TR0|created a bigger firestorm when 
20101231140051.870|20101231140054.147|TR0|it published more than 90,000 
20101231140054.147|20101231140056.423|TR0|classified U.S. military war 
20101231140056.423|20101231140058.700|TR0|logs of the war in Afghanistan. 
20101231140058.700|20101231140100.976|TR0|Then in October, WikiLeaks 
20101231140100.976|20101231140103.253|TR0|published some 390,000 
20101231140103.253|20101231140105.529|TR0|classified U.S. documents on the 
20101231140105.529|20101231140107.806|TR0|war in Iraq, the largest 
20101231140107.806|20101231140110.082|TR0|intelligence leak in U.S. 
20101231140110.082|20101231140112.359|TR0|history and the greatest 
20101231140112.359|20101231140114.635|TR0|internal account of any war on 
20101231140114.635|20101231140116.912|TR0|public record. In November, 
20101231140116.912|20101231140119.188|TR0|WikiLeaks began releasing a 
20101231140119.188|20101231140121.465|TR0|giant trove of confidential 
20101231140121.465|20101231140123.741|TR0|State Department cables that 
20101231140123.741|20101231140126.018|TR0|sent shockwaves through the 
20101231140126.018|20101231140128.294|TR0|global diplomatic establishment.
20101231140128.294|20101231140130.571|TR0|
20101231140130.571|20101231140132.847|TR0|Throughout it all, WikiLeaks and 
20101231140132.847|20101231140135.124|TR0|its founder Julian Assange were 
20101231140135.124|20101231140137.400|TR0|targeted by the U.S. and other 
20101231140137.400|20101231140139.676|TR0|governments around the world. In 
20101231140139.676|20101231140141.953|TR0|December, Julian Assange was 
20101231140141.953|20101231140144.229|TR0|arrested in London on an 
20101231140144.229|20101231140146.506|TR0|international warrant to face 
20101231140146.506|20101231140148.782|TR0|sex crimes allegations in 
20101231140148.782|20101231140151.059|TR0|Sweden. He spent more than a 
20101231140151.059|20101231140153.335|TR0|week in solitary confinement 
20101231140153.335|20101231140155.612|TR0|before being released on bail. 
20101231140155.612|20101231140157.888|TR0|He emerged from the London 
20101231140157.888|20101231140200.165|TR0|courthouse to cheers from a 
20101231140200.165|20101231140202.441|TR0|crowd of supporters waiting 
20101231140202.441|20101231140204.718|TR0|outside.
20101231140204.718|20101231140206.994|TR0|
20101231140206.994|20101231140209.271|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: During my 
20101231140209.271|20101231140211.547|TR0|time in solitary confinement in 
20101231140211.547|20101231140213.824|TR0|the bottom of a Victorian 
20101231140213.824|20101231140216.100|TR0|prison, I had time to reflect on 
20101231140216.100|20101231140218.377|TR0|the conditions of those people 
20101231140218.377|20101231140220.653|TR0|around the world also in 
20101231140220.653|20101231140222.930|TR0|solitary confinement, also on 
20101231140222.930|20101231140225.206|TR0|remand, in conditions that are 
20101231140225.206|20101231140227.483|TR0|more difficult than those faced 
20101231140227.483|20101231140229.759|TR0|by me. Those people also need 
20101231140229.759|20101231140232.036|TR0|your attention and support.
20101231140232.036|20101231140234.312|TR0|
20101231140234.312|20101231140236.589|TR0|And with that, I hope to 
20101231140236.589|20101231140238.865|TR0|continue my work and continue to 
20101231140238.865|20101231140241.142|TR0|protest my innocence in this 
20101231140241.142|20101231140243.418|TR0|matter and to reveal, as we get 
20101231140243.418|20101231140245.695|TR0|it - which we have not yet - the 
20101231140245.695|20101231140247.971|TR0|evidence from these allegations. 
20101231140247.971|20101231140250.248|TR0|Thank you.
20101231140250.248|20101231140252.524|TR0|
20101231140252.524|20101231140254.800|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Julian Assange, 
20101231140254.800|20101231140257.077|TR0|speaking in London in December.
20101231140257.077|20101231140259.353|TR0|
20101231140259.353|20101231140301.630|TR0|Today we spend the hour on 
20101231140301.630|20101231140303.906|TR0|WikiLeaks. We interviewed Julian 
20101231140303.906|20101231140306.183|TR0|Assange several times throughout 
20101231140306.183|20101231140308.459|TR0|the year. In July, just after 
20101231140308.459|20101231140310.736|TR0|WikiLeaks published the tens of 
20101231140310.736|20101231140313.012|TR0|thousands of Afghanistan war 
20101231140313.012|20101231140315.289|TR0|logs, Julian Assange joined us 
20101231140315.289|20101231140317.565|TR0|for an extended interview from 
20101231140317.565|20101231140319.842|TR0|London. I began by asking him 
20101231140319.842|20101231140322.118|TR0|what he thought were the most 
20101231140322.118|20101231140324.395|TR0|important revelations in the 
20101231140324.395|20101231140326.671|TR0|documents.
20101231140326.671|20101231140328.948|TR0|
20101231140328.948|20101231140331.224|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: What is most 
20101231140331.224|20101231140333.501|TR0|important is the vast sweep of 
20101231140333.501|20101231140335.777|TR0|abuses that have occurred during 
20101231140335.777|20101231140338.054|TR0|the past six years, the vast 
20101231140338.054|20101231140340.330|TR0|sweep of sort of the everyday 
20101231140340.330|20101231140342.607|TR0|squalor and carnage of war. If 
20101231140342.607|20101231140344.883|TR0|we add all that up, we see that 
20101231140344.883|20101231140347.160|TR0|in fact most civilian casualties 
20101231140347.160|20101231140349.436|TR0|occur in instances where one, 
20101231140349.436|20101231140351.713|TR0|two, 10 or 20 people are killed. 
20101231140351.713|20101231140353.989|TR0|And they really numerically 
20101231140353.989|20101231140356.266|TR0|dominate the list of events, so 
20101231140356.266|20101231140358.542|TR0|it's, of course, hard for us to 
20101231140358.542|20101231140400.819|TR0|imagine that. It's so much 
20101231140400.819|20101231140403.095|TR0|material. But that is the way to 
20101231140403.095|20101231140405.372|TR0|really understand this war, is 
20101231140405.372|20101231140407.648|TR0|by seeing that there is one sort 
20101231140407.648|20101231140409.924|TR0|of kill after another every day 
20101231140409.924|20101231140412.201|TR0|going on and on and on in all 
20101231140412.201|20101231140414.477|TR0|sorts of different circumstances.
20101231140414.477|20101231140416.754|TR0|
20101231140416.754|20101231140419.030|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You have said 
20101231140419.030|20101231140421.307|TR0|you feel there is evidence of 
20101231140421.307|20101231140423.583|TR0|war crimes here. Can you talk 
20101231140423.583|20101231140425.860|TR0|about that? And specifically, 
20101231140425.860|20101231140428.136|TR0|what are the examples that you 
20101231140428.136|20101231140430.413|TR0|feel are the most important?
20101231140430.413|20101231140432.689|TR0|
20101231140432.689|20101231140434.966|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Yeah. Yeah, 
20101231140434.966|20101231140437.242|TR0|well, these reports can be quite 
20101231140437.242|20101231140439.519|TR0|terse, so I wouldn't want to 
20101231140439.519|20101231140441.795|TR0|prejudge the issue and say for 
20101231140441.795|20101231140444.072|TR0|sure that a war crime has 
20101231140444.072|20101231140446.348|TR0|committed - been committed. But 
20101231140446.348|20101231140448.625|TR0|some are deeply suspicious, and 
20101231140448.625|20101231140450.901|TR0|there are examples which have 
20101231140450.901|20101231140453.178|TR0|been not mentioned in the 
20101231140453.178|20101231140455.454|TR0|Western press but, as we've 
20101231140455.454|20101231140457.731|TR0|discovered, have been mentioned 
20101231140457.731|20101231140500.007|TR0|elsewhere that are almost surely 
20101231140500.007|20101231140502.284|TR0|war crimes.
20101231140502.284|20101231140504.560|TR0|
20101231140504.560|20101231140506.837|TR0|As an example, in the material, 
20101231140506.837|20101231140509.113|TR0|there's a Polish My Lai. Polish 
20101231140509.113|20101231140511.390|TR0|troops were hit by an IED and 
20101231140511.390|20101231140513.666|TR0|the next day went to the closest 
20101231140513.666|20101231140515.943|TR0|village, which I guess they felt 
20101231140515.943|20101231140518.219|TR0|had supported the IED attack, 
20101231140518.219|20101231140520.496|TR0|and shelled the village. 
20101231140520.496|20101231140522.772|TR0|Similarly, we see something like 
20101231140522.772|20101231140525.048|TR0|Task Force 373, a special forces 
20101231140525.048|20101231140527.325|TR0|assassination squad so secretive 
20101231140527.325|20101231140529.601|TR0|that it changes its military 
20101231140529.601|20101231140531.878|TR0|code name every six months, 
20101231140531.878|20101231140534.154|TR0|working its way down the JPEL, 
20101231140534.154|20101231140536.431|TR0|Joint Priority Effects List, 
20101231140536.431|20101231140538.707|TR0|kill or capture list, usually a 
20101231140538.707|20101231140540.984|TR0|kill list. And we have seen 
20101231140540.984|20101231140543.260|TR0|events where it has performed 
20101231140543.260|20101231140545.537|TR0|secret missile strikes on a 
20101231140545.537|20101231140547.813|TR0|house, from within close 
20101231140547.813|20101231140550.090|TR0|proximity, and ended up killing 
20101231140550.090|20101231140552.366|TR0|at least seven children, and a 
20101231140552.366|20101231140554.643|TR0|number of other instances. The 
20101231140554.643|20101231140556.919|TR0|report itself about that says at 
20101231140556.919|20101231140559.196|TR0|the beginning that the 
20101231140559.196|20101231140601.472|TR0|information about 373 being 
20101231140601.472|20101231140603.749|TR0|involved in that event, together 
20101231140603.749|20101231140606.025|TR0|with the use of the HIMARS 
20101231140606.025|20101231140608.302|TR0|missile system, this 
20101231140608.302|20101231140610.578|TR0|ground-to-ground missile attack, 
20101231140610.578|20101231140612.855|TR0|is to be kept secret even from

20101231140633.343|20101231140635.620|TR0|We've made a good initial 
20101231140635.620|20101231140637.896|TR0|forray: 14 pages in The Guardian 
20101231140637.896|20101231140640.172|TR0|on Monday, 17 pages in Der 
20101231140640.172|20101231140642.449|TR0|Spiegel, front page of the _New 
20101231140642.449|20101231140644.725|TR0|York Times, together with 
20101231140644.725|20101231140647.002|TR0|underlying support. But 
20101231140647.002|20101231140649.278|TR0|altogether, the journalistic 
20101231140649.278|20101231140651.555|TR0|coalition that we put around 
20101231140651.555|20101231140653.831|TR0|this material to try and bring 
20101231140653.831|20101231140656.108|TR0|it out to the public and get 
20101231140656.108|20101231140658.384|TR0|impact for it has read about 
20101231140658.384|20101231140700.661|TR0|2,000 of these reports in 
20101231140700.661|20101231140702.937|TR0|detail. There's 91,000 reports. 
20101231140702.937|20101231140705.214|TR0|We really need the public, other 
20101231140705.214|20101231140707.490|TR0|journalists and especially 
20101231140707.490|20101231140709.767|TR0|former soldiers to go through 
20101231140709.767|20101231140712.043|TR0|this material and say, "Look, 
20101231140712.043|20101231140714.320|TR0|this connects to that," or "I 
20101231140714.320|20101231140716.596|TR0|was there. Let me tell you what 
20101231140716.596|20101231140718.873|TR0|really happened. Let me tell you 
20101231140718.873|20101231140721.149|TR0|the rest of the detail." And 
20101231140721.149|20101231140723.426|TR0|over the next few days, we'll be 
20101231140723.426|20101231140725.702|TR0|putting up easier- and 
20101231140725.702|20101231140727.979|TR0|easier-to-use search interfaces, 
20101231140727.979|20101231140730.255|TR0|the same ones that our 
20101231140730.255|20101231140732.532|TR0|journalistic teams use to 
20101231140732.532|20101231140734.808|TR0|extract this data. Already if 
20101231140734.808|20101231140737.085|TR0|you go to war diaries - 
20101231140737.085|20101231140739.361|TR0|wardiary.wikileaks.org, you'll 
20101231140739.361|20101231140741.638|TR0|see several different ways of 
20101231140741.638|20101231140743.914|TR0|browsing through this. You can 
20101231140743.914|20101231140746.191|TR0|look through some 200 different 
20101231140746.191|20101231140748.467|TR0|categories that the U.S. 
20101231140748.467|20101231140750.744|TR0|military applied to these 
20101231140750.744|20101231140753.020|TR0|reports. As an example, there's 
20101231140753.020|20101231140755.297|TR0|2,200 escalation of force events 
20101231140755.297|20101231140757.573|TR0|self-described by the U.S. 
20101231140757.573|20101231140759.849|TR0|military.
20101231140759.849|20101231140802.126|TR0|
20101231140802.126|20101231140804.402|TR0|You have to be careful when 
20101231140804.402|20101231140806.679|TR0|reading the material. Reports 
20101231140806.679|20101231140808.955|TR0|that are made by military units 
20101231140808.955|20101231140811.232|TR0|that were involved in an attack 
20101231140811.232|20101231140813.508|TR0|or a counterattack are often 
20101231140813.508|20101231140815.785|TR0|biased, just like we know that 
20101231140815.785|20101231140818.061|TR0|when a police officer is 
20101231140818.061|20101231140820.338|TR0|involved in a shooting and 
20101231140820.338|20101231140822.614|TR0|creates the report about that 
20101231140822.614|20101231140824.891|TR0|shooting, the facts are likely 
20101231140824.891|20101231140827.167|TR0|to be distorted or twisted. 
20101231140827.167|20101231140829.444|TR0|Similarly, when a military unit 
20101231140829.444|20101231140831.720|TR0|is involved in killing someone 
20101231140831.720|20101231140833.997|TR0|who turns out to be a civilian, 
20101231140833.997|20101231140836.273|TR0|we see lots of exculpatory 
20101231140836.273|20101231140838.550|TR0|language or hiding of facts. And 
20101231140838.550|20101231140840.826|TR0|where we know an additional sort 
20101231140840.826|20101231140843.103|TR0|of public record or a full 
20101231140843.103|20101231140845.379|TR0|investigation has occurred, as 
20101231140845.379|20101231140847.656|TR0|an example Kunduz, the bombing 
20101231140847.656|20101231140849.932|TR0|that occurred in 2005 which 
20101231140849.932|20101231140852.209|TR0|especially the German press 
20101231140852.209|20101231140854.485|TR0|investigated in great detail, we 
20101231140854.485|20101231140856.762|TR0|can go back and see the initial 
20101231140856.762|20101231140859.038|TR0|report that the troops filed 
20101231140859.038|20101231140901.315|TR0|about what they did, and we see, 
20101231140901.315|20101231140903.591|TR0|instead of civilian kills, no 
20101231140903.591|20101231140905.868|TR0|mentions of civilians at all. 
20101231140905.868|20101231140908.144|TR0|Instead of over a hundred people 
20101231140908.144|20101231140910.421|TR0|killed, we just see 56. And we 
20101231140910.421|20101231140912.697|TR0|can see that in report after 
20101231140912.697|20101231140914.973|TR0|report. So the sort of corrupt 
20101231140914.973|20101231140917.250|TR0|reporting starts on the ground 
20101231140917.250|20101231140919.526|TR0|and then moves its way up 
20101231140919.526|20101231140921.803|TR0|through the Pentagon and the 
20101231140921.803|20101231140924.079|TR0|press relations people and is 
20101231140924.079|20101231140926.356|TR0|then put into a politically sort 
20101231140926.356|20101231140928.632|TR0|of digestible form.
20101231140928.632|20101231140930.909|TR0|
20101231140930.909|20101231140933.185|TR0|But what you don't see 
20101231140933.185|20101231140935.462|TR0|straightaway is a sort of 
20101231140935.462|20101231140937.738|TR0|contradiction by the base 
20101231140937.738|20101231140940.015|TR0|material and what is put out in 
20101231140940.015|20101231140942.291|TR0|public, although we are starting 
20101231140942.291|20101231140944.568|TR0|to see that in different events. 
20101231140944.568|20101231140946.844|TR0|But because this internal 
20101231140946.844|20101231140949.121|TR0|military reporting specifies 
20101231140949.121|20101231140951.397|TR0|where an event happened, which 
20101231140951.397|20101231140953.674|TR0|units were involved and when, 
20101231140953.674|20101231140955.950|TR0|and were done sort of on the 
20101231140955.950|20101231140958.227|TR0|same day, why there is simple 
20101231140958.227|20101231141000.503|TR0|cover-ups. They cannot be 
20101231141000.503|20101231141002.780|TR0|complex cover-ups in this 
20101231141002.780|20101231141005.056|TR0|material. So, by joining 
20101231141005.056|20101231141007.333|TR0|together several of these 
20101231141007.333|20101231141009.609|TR0|reports together with the public 
20101231141009.609|20101231141011.886|TR0|record, we've been able to 
20101231141011.886|20101231141014.162|TR0|discover the material of the 
20101231141014.162|20101231141016.439|TR0|sort of civilian casualty 
20101231141016.439|20101231141018.715|TR0|cover-ups or the involvement 
20101231141018.715|20101231141020.992|TR0|with the ISI.
20101231141020.992|20101231141023.268|TR0|
20101231141023.268|20101231141025.545|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: The New York 
20101231141025.545|20101231141027.821|TR0|Times says it consulted with the 
20101231141027.821|20101231141030.097|TR0|White House, showed them the 
20101231141030.097|20101231141032.374|TR0|documents to, oh, redact 
20101231141032.374|20101231141034.650|TR0|whatever would endanger people, 
20101231141034.650|20101231141036.927|TR0|sources on the ground. How have 
20101231141036.927|20101231141039.203|TR0|you - or I should say, Julian 
20101231141039.203|20101231141041.480|TR0|Assange, have you communicated 
20101231141041.480|20101231141043.756|TR0|with the White House at this 
20101231141043.756|20101231141046.033|TR0|point?
20101231141046.033|20101231141048.309|TR0|
20101231141048.309|20101231141050.586|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, there's 
20101231141050.586|20101231141052.862|TR0|quite some disingenuous messages 
20101231141052.862|20101231141055.139|TR0|coming out of the White House in 
20101231141055.139|20101231141057.415|TR0|relation to the lead-up to 
20101231141057.415|20101231141059.692|TR0|publication. Our media team 
20101231141059.692|20101231141101.968|TR0|didn't want to all be stepping 
20101231141101.968|20101231141104.245|TR0|on each other's toes, so we 
20101231141104.245|20101231141106.521|TR0|selected the New York Times to 
20101231141106.521|20101231141108.798|TR0|be the group that would approach 
20101231141108.798|20101231141111.074|TR0|the White House and try and get 
20101231141111.074|20101231141113.351|TR0|what their statement was on the 
20101231141113.351|20101231141115.627|TR0|matter. That said, you know, 
20101231141115.627|20101231141117.904|TR0|there is a bit of a difference 
20101231141117.904|20101231141120.180|TR0|between how the Times and the 
20101231141120.180|20101231141122.457|TR0|Washington Post, who was 
20101231141122.457|20101231141124.733|TR0|involved in this issue, but how 
20101231141124.733|20101231141127.010|TR0|the American press tends to deal 
20101231141127.010|20101231141129.286|TR0|with government agencies prior 
20101231141129.286|20101231141131.563|TR0|to publication and the standards 
20101231141131.563|20101231141133.839|TR0|that we have and the standards 
20101231141133.839|20101231141136.116|TR0|the European press has. We don't 
20101231141136.116|20101231141138.392|TR0|see that an organization that is 
20101231141138.392|20101231141140.669|TR0|- we don't see, in the case of a 
20101231141140.669|20101231141142.945|TR0|story where an organization has 
20101231141142.945|20101231141145.221|TR0|engaged in some kind of abusive 
20101231141145.221|20101231141147.498|TR0|conduct and that story is being 
20101231141147.498|20101231141149.774|TR0|revealed, that it has a right to 
20101231141149.774|20101231141152.051|TR0|know the story before the 
20101231141152.051|20101231141154.327|TR0|public, a right to know the 
20101231141154.327|20101231141156.604|TR0|story before the victims, 
20101231141156.604|20101231141158.880|TR0|because we know that what 
20101231141158.880|20101231141201.157|TR0|happens in practice is that that 
20101231141201.157|20101231141203.433|TR0|is just extra lead time to spin 
20101231141203.433|20101231141205.710|TR0|the story. And we see some sort 
20101231141205.710|20101231141207.986|TR0|of pathetic attempts by the 
20101231141207.986|20101231141210.263|TR0|White House to engage in a bit 
20101231141210.263|20101231141212.539|TR0|of spin about whether we 
20101231141212.539|20101231141214.816|TR0|contacted them or not. In fact, 
20101231141214.816|20101231141217.092|TR0|we did contact them through the 
20101231141217.092|20101231141219.369|TR0|New York Times as a coalition.

20101231141228.475|20101231141230.751|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Yes, they 
20101231141230.751|20101231141233.028|TR0|praised the New York Times. I 
20101231141233.028|20101231141235.304|TR0|mean, you have to understand, 
20101231141235.304|20101231141237.581|TR0|the New York Times is a 
20101231141237.581|20101231141239.857|TR0|mainstream organization, and it 
20101231141239.857|20101231141242.134|TR0|does work within a particular 
20101231141242.134|20101231141244.410|TR0|milieu and particular 
20101231141244.410|20101231141246.687|TR0|constraints that appear to be 
20101231141246.687|20101231141248.963|TR0|present. But we aren't totally 
20101231141248.963|20101231141251.240|TR0|happy about the way that the 
20101231141251.240|20101231141253.516|TR0|Times has sort of defensively 
20101231141253.516|20101231141255.793|TR0|written. That does seem a little 
20101231141255.793|20101231141258.069|TR0|bit unprofessional. So, as an 
20101231141258.069|20101231141300.345|TR0|example, the New York Times 
20101231141300.345|20101231141302.622|TR0|stated that it chose not to link 
20101231141302.622|20101231141304.898|TR0|to our website. I mean, it is 
20101231141304.898|20101231141307.175|TR0|just ridiculous. The public can 
20101231141307.175|20101231141309.451|TR0|see that and Google it, if they 
20101231141309.451|20101231141311.728|TR0|want. If the New York Times, for 
20101231141311.728|20101231141314.004|TR0|whatever reason, wants to not 
20101231141314.004|20101231141316.281|TR0|link to WikiLeaks for its own 
20101231141316.281|20101231141318.557|TR0|defensive politics, then it can 
20101231141318.557|20101231141320.834|TR0|do that, and it's perfectly 
20101231141320.834|20101231141323.110|TR0|entitled to. But to deliberately 
20101231141323.110|20101231141325.387|TR0|say that that is being avoided 
20101231141325.387|20101231141327.663|TR0|smacks of unprofessional 
20101231141327.663|20101231141329.940|TR0|conduct, to me. Now, that 
20101231141329.940|20101231141332.216|TR0|doesn't mean it's been approved 
20101231141332.216|20101231141334.493|TR0|by the editor to do that, but it 
20101231141334.493|20101231141336.769|TR0|does seem to be quite 
20101231141336.769|20101231141339.046|TR0|pusillanimous to be engaging in 
20101231141339.046|20101231141341.322|TR0|that kind of defensive conduct, 
20101231141341.322|20101231141343.599|TR0|instead of pursuing the real 
20101231141343.599|20101231141345.875|TR0|meat of the story.

20101231141408.640|20101231141410.917|TR0|right. Our promise to our source 
20101231141410.917|20101231141413.193|TR0|is that we will try and get the 
20101231141413.193|20101231141415.469|TR0|maximum possible impact for 
20101231141415.469|20101231141417.746|TR0|their material. And we could see 
20101231141417.746|20101231141420.022|TR0|that this was an issue where we 
20101231141420.022|20101231141422.299|TR0|could actually pull together a 
20101231141422.299|20101231141424.575|TR0|coalition of both influential 
20101231141424.575|20101231141426.852|TR0|media organizations and media

20101231141431.405|20101231141433.681|TR0|research. That was a - in 
20101231141433.681|20101231141435.958|TR0|itself, that's an unusual 
20101231141435.958|20101231141438.234|TR0|collaboration to have brought 
20101231141438.234|20101231141440.511|TR0|together these four groups, have 
20101231141440.511|20101231141442.787|TR0|them exchanging research data, 
20101231141442.787|20101231141445.064|TR0|and all agree on the same

20101231141500.999|20101231141503.276|TR0|obviously, we can't say, as an 
20101231141503.276|20101231141505.552|TR0|organization that specializes in 
20101231141505.552|20101231141507.829|TR0|source protection. We are also 
20101231141507.829|20101231141510.105|TR0|obligated, under the Swedish 
20101231141510.105|20101231141512.382|TR0|Constitution's right to 
20101231141512.382|20101231141514.658|TR0|anonymity, to not reveal our 
20101231141514.658|20101231141516.935|TR0|sources. Revealing our sources 
20101231141516.935|20101231141519.211|TR0|is, in fact, a criminal offense 
20101231141519.211|20101231141521.488|TR0|in Sweden. And also, that holds 
20101231141521.488|20101231141523.764|TR0|for our contractors and computer 
20101231141523.764|20101231141526.041|TR0|programmers. Now, that said, we 
20101231141526.041|20101231141528.317|TR0|can see that the material did 
20101231141528.317|20101231141530.594|TR0|come from the United States 
20101231141530.594|20101231141532.870|TR0|government somewhere. And that's 
20101231141532.870|20101231141535.146|TR0|obvious from some of the other 
20101231141535.146|20101231141537.423|TR0|material that we have put out 
20101231141537.423|20101231141539.699|TR0|over the years. It's one of the 
20101231141539.699|20101231141541.976|TR0|hopeful things about these sort 
20101231141541.976|20101231141544.252|TR0|of publications, is that it's 
20101231141544.252|20101231141546.529|TR0|not just us exposing abuses of 
20101231141546.529|20101231141548.805|TR0|war, it's not just us exposing 
20101231141548.805|20101231141551.082|TR0|corruption in Africa; rather, it 
20101231141551.082|20101231141553.358|TR0|is insiders who are men or women 
20101231141553.358|20101231141555.635|TR0|of good conscience who are 
20101231141555.635|20101231141557.911|TR0|deciding to help expose the 
20101231141557.911|20101231141600.188|TR0|situation, because they want 
20101231141600.188|20101231141602.464|TR0|their own organizations to be 
20101231141602.464|20101231141604.741|TR0|reformed. So there are good 
20101231141604.741|20101231141607.017|TR0|people within the United States 
20101231141607.017|20101231141609.294|TR0|government, and supportive of us 
20101231141609.294|20101231141611.570|TR0|and our ideals, and those people 
20101231141611.570|20101231141613.847|TR0|step forward to make events like 
20101231141613.847|20101231141616.123|TR0|this a reality. Now remember, we 
20101231141616.123|20101231141618.400|TR0|have put in a lot of work into 
20101231141618.400|20101231141620.676|TR0|this, and we have had some legal 
20101231141620.676|20101231141622.953|TR0|and surveillance difficulties in 
20101231141622.953|20101231141625.229|TR0|the past few months, but the

20101231141719.865|20101231141722.141|TR0|is taking note. There's 14 pages 
20101231141722.141|20101231141724.418|TR0|in Monday's Guardian newspaper, 
20101231141724.418|20101231141726.694|TR0|nearly - more than one-third of

20101231141728.971|20101231141731.247|TR0|this issue; 17 pages in Der

20101231141733.524|20101231141735.800|TR0|publication in Germany. So, 
20101231141735.800|20101231141738.077|TR0|Europe is certainly taking note 
20101231141738.077|20101231141740.353|TR0|of the tenor that is coming out 
20101231141740.353|20101231141742.630|TR0|of the White House and to

20101231141749.459|20101231141751.736|TR0|see, and hopefully that's also 
20101231141751.736|20101231141754.012|TR0|what the U.S. population wants 
20101231141754.012|20101231141756.289|TR0|to see, which is a clear

20101231141816.777|20101231141819.053|TR0|secret memo that WikiLeaks 
20101231141819.053|20101231141821.330|TR0|posted in March, marked

20101231141828.159|20101231141830.436|TR0|"'WikiLeaks.org represents a

20101231141841.818|20101231141844.095|TR0|information." Can you respond to 
20101231141844.095|20101231141846.371|TR0|this?
20101231141846.371|20101231141848.648|TR0|
20101231141848.648|20101231141850.924|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Yeah. This 
20101231141850.924|20101231141853.201|TR0|was a 2008 counterintelligence 
20101231141853.201|20101231141855.477|TR0|analysis of us by the U.S. Army. 
20101231141855.477|20101231141857.754|TR0|Now, some 32 pages - and these 
20101231141857.754|20101231141900.030|TR0|initial headers, you don't need 
20101231141900.030|20101231141902.307|TR0|to worry about. In order for a 
20101231141902.307|20101231141904.583|TR0|counterintelligence agent to be 
20101231141904.583|20101231141906.860|TR0|writing a report - analyst to be 
20101231141906.860|20101231141909.136|TR0|writing a report about anything, 
20101231141909.136|20101231141911.413|TR0|they have to justify why they 
20101231141911.413|20101231141913.689|TR0|are writing a report with 
20101231141913.689|20101231141915.966|TR0|language like that, and the same 
20101231141915.966|20101231141918.242|TR0|with the conclusions.
20101231141918.242|20101231141920.518|TR0|
20101231141920.518|20101231141922.795|TR0|Now, what's more interesting 
20101231141922.795|20101231141925.071|TR0|about that report is the middle. 
20101231141925.071|20101231141927.348|TR0|It says that - it recommends 
20101231141927.348|20101231141929.624|TR0|that we be attacked by 
20101231141929.624|20101231141931.901|TR0|destroying our center of gravity 
20101231141931.901|20101231141934.177|TR0|- that is, the trust that 
20101231141934.177|20101231141936.454|TR0|confidential sources have in us 
20101231141936.454|20101231141938.730|TR0|and the trust that the public 
20101231141938.730|20101231141941.007|TR0|has in the integrity of the 
20101231141941.007|20101231141943.283|TR0|material that we release. It 
20101231141943.283|20101231141945.560|TR0|goes on to explain examples of 
20101231141945.560|20101231141947.836|TR0|why we maybe should be attacked. 
20101231141947.836|20101231141950.113|TR0|And those examples are examples 
20101231141950.113|20101231141952.389|TR0|which have embarrassed the U.S. 
20101231141952.389|20101231141954.666|TR0|military, revelations of abuses 
20101231141954.666|20101231141956.942|TR0|at Guantanamo Bay, abuses in 
20101231141956.942|20101231141959.219|TR0|Fallujah, and potentially 
20101231141959.219|20101231142001.495|TR0|illegal use of small chemical 
20101231142001.495|20101231142003.772|TR0|weapons in Iraq. Now, it says 
20101231142003.772|20101231142006.048|TR0|that one of the ways of 
20101231142006.048|20101231142008.325|TR0|attacking that center of gravity 
20101231142008.325|20101231142010.601|TR0|is by publicly prosecuting 
20101231142010.601|20101231142012.878|TR0|whistleblowers. It even uses 
20101231142012.878|20101231142015.154|TR0|that word, "whistleblower," not 
20101231142015.154|20101231142017.431|TR0|U.S. military personnel or other 
20101231142017.431|20101231142019.707|TR0|personnel who are engaging in 
20101231142019.707|20101231142021.984|TR0|irresponsible leaking, but 
20101231142021.984|20101231142024.260|TR0|rather whistleblowers, people 
20101231142024.260|20101231142026.537|TR0|who are blowing the whistle on 
20101231142026.537|20101231142028.813|TR0|abuse. Now, we don't know 
20101231142028.813|20101231142031.090|TR0|whether the recommendations of 
20101231142031.090|20101231142033.366|TR0|that report were treated 
20101231142033.366|20101231142035.642|TR0|seriously or were followed. It's 
20101231142035.642|20101231142037.919|TR0|quite possible that the analyst 
20101231142037.919|20101231142040.195|TR0|who wrote that report was not 
20101231142040.195|20101231142042.472|TR0|treated seriously, was viewed as 
20101231142042.472|20101231142044.748|TR0|politically too hard to go after 
20101231142044.748|20101231142047.025|TR0|us in that way. But it is 
20101231142047.025|20101231142049.301|TR0|concerning that that 
20101231142049.301|20101231142051.578|TR0|intelligence analyst felt that 
20101231142051.578|20101231142053.854|TR0|the U.S. Army culture was such 
20101231142053.854|20101231142056.131|TR0|that it was even acceptable to 
20101231142056.131|20101231142058.407|TR0|produce a report like that about 
20101231142058.407|20101231142100.684|TR0|press criticism and how to stop 
20101231142100.684|20101231142102.960|TR0|it.

20101231142123.449|20101231142125.725|TR0|after WikiLeaks published the 
20101231142125.725|20101231142128.002|TR0|tens of thousands of Afghanistan 
20101231142128.002|20101231142130.278|TR0|war logs, WikiLeaks founder 
20101231142130.278|20101231142132.555|TR0|Julian Assange joined us from 
20101231142132.555|20101231142134.831|TR0|London. We continue with that

20101231142141.661|20101231142143.937|TR0|what about your safety? Daniel 
20101231142143.937|20101231142146.214|TR0|Ellsberg, the most famous 
20101231142146.214|20101231142148.490|TR0|whistleblower in America, who 
20101231142148.490|20101231142150.766|TR0|released the Pentagon Papers, 
20101231142150.766|20101231142153.043|TR0|expressed concern about your 
20101231142153.043|20101231142155.319|TR0|safety. Can you talk 
20101231142155.319|20101231142157.596|TR0|specifically about what the U.S. 
20101231142157.596|20101231142159.872|TR0|government has done, in relation 
20101231142159.872|20101231142202.149|TR0|to the Australian government and 
20101231142202.149|20101231142204.425|TR0|in other ways, in dealing with 
20101231142204.425|20101231142206.702|TR0|you?
20101231142206.702|20101231142208.978|TR0|
20101231142208.978|20101231142211.255|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Yeah. So, 
20101231142211.255|20101231142213.531|TR0|some months - well, between one 
20101231142213.531|20101231142215.808|TR0|and two months ago, there were 
20101231142215.808|20101231142218.084|TR0|concerning noises coming out of 
20101231142218.084|20101231142220.361|TR0|the U.S. administration that we 
20101231142220.361|20101231142222.637|TR0|were aware of from our sources 
20101231142222.637|20101231142224.914|TR0|there. And I was given warnings, 
20101231142224.914|20101231142227.190|TR0|by Sy Hersh and other people who 
20101231142227.190|20101231142229.467|TR0|are connected to that world, to 
20101231142229.467|20101231142231.743|TR0|watch my back. Subsequently, we 
20101231142231.743|20101231142234.020|TR0|have discovered that the U.S. 
20101231142234.020|20101231142236.296|TR0|administration, according to a 
20101231142236.296|20101231142238.573|TR0|well-placed Australian national 
20101231142238.573|20101231142240.849|TR0|security journalist and former 
20101231142240.849|20101231142243.126|TR0|diplomat, that an approach was 
20101231142243.126|20101231142245.402|TR0|made to Australian intelligence 
20101231142245.402|20101231142247.679|TR0|by the U.S. for them to conduct 
20101231142247.679|20101231142249.955|TR0|extensive surveillance and 
20101231142249.955|20101231142252.232|TR0|possibly raids or detainment of 
20101231142252.232|20101231142254.508|TR0|our people in Australia. That 
20101231142254.508|20101231142256.785|TR0|was largely rejected, according 
20101231142256.785|20101231142259.061|TR0|to this reporter, by the 
20101231142259.061|20101231142301.338|TR0|Australian government for 
20101231142301.338|20101231142303.614|TR0|political reasons. It's quite 
20101231142303.614|20101231142305.891|TR0|sensitive for the Australian 
20101231142305.891|20101231142308.167|TR0|government to engage in a 
20101231142308.167|20101231142310.443|TR0|cooperation that would lead to 
20101231142310.443|20101231142312.720|TR0|an Australian citizen, 
20101231142312.720|20101231142314.996|TR0|especially an Australian 
20101231142314.996|20101231142317.273|TR0|journalist, ending up in an 
20101231142317.273|20101231142319.549|TR0|overseas prison or being 
20101231142319.549|20101231142321.826|TR0|prosecuted in some way. Within 
20101231142321.826|20101231142324.102|TR0|the United Kingdom, of course, 
20101231142324.102|20101231142326.379|TR0|there is fairly extensive 
20101231142326.379|20101231142328.655|TR0|surveillance of political 
20101231142328.655|20101231142330.932|TR0|people, people who are viewed as 
20101231142330.932|20101231142333.208|TR0|politically sensitive in the 
20101231142333.208|20101231142335.485|TR0|United Kingdom. That said, we do 
20101231142335.485|20101231142337.761|TR0|have extensive political and 
20101231142337.761|20101231142340.038|TR0|media support here. And I would 
20101231142340.038|20101231142342.314|TR0|be extremely surprised to see 
20101231142342.314|20101231142344.591|TR0|any aggressive action by 
20101231142344.591|20101231142346.867|TR0|intelligence within the U.K. or 
20101231142346.867|20101231142349.144|TR0|by overseas intelligence 
20101231142349.144|20101231142351.420|TR0|operating within the United 
20101231142351.420|20101231142353.697|TR0|Kingdom. I think that would be 
20101231142353.697|20101231142355.973|TR0|unlikely to be tolerated.

20101231142358.250|20101231142400.526|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Julian, do you 
20101231142400.526|20101231142402.803|TR0|feel you can come into the 
20101231142402.803|20101231142405.079|TR0|United States?

20101231142409.632|20101231142411.909|TR0|advice is to not attend the 
20101231142411.909|20101231142414.185|TR0|United States, and I cancelled

20101231142423.291|20101231142425.567|TR0|Now, on that same panel that I 
20101231142425.567|20101231142427.844|TR0|was due to speak at was Valerie

20101231142430.120|20101231142432.397|TR0|but also Scott Risen, a New York

20101231142446.056|20101231142448.332|TR0|Risen, who wrote a book 
20101231142448.332|20101231142450.609|TR0|revealing some details of some 
20101231142450.609|20101231142452.885|TR0|bungled CIA operations. He also 
20101231142452.885|20101231142455.162|TR0|did not speak at that panel for 
20101231142455.162|20101231142457.438|TR0|legal reasons relating to

20101231142501.991|20101231142504.268|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I'd like you to 
20101231142504.268|20101231142506.544|TR0|respond quickly to the responses 
20101231142506.544|20101231142508.821|TR0|of the administration, of the 
20101231142508.821|20101231142511.097|TR0|Obama administration: one, that 
20101231142511.097|20101231142513.374|TR0|this is old news, that it goes 
20101231142513.374|20101231142515.650|TR0|until December '09, exactly when 
20101231142515.650|20101231142517.927|TR0|the Obama administration changed 
20101231142517.927|20101231142520.203|TR0|its policy with the surge.
20101231142520.203|20101231142522.480|TR0|
20101231142522.480|20101231142524.756|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Yeah, so, 
20101231142524.756|20101231142527.033|TR0|this is a bit of rhetorical 
20101231142527.033|20101231142529.309|TR0|trickery by the White House. The 
20101231142529.309|20101231142531.586|TR0|material goes to December 31, 
20101231142531.586|20101231142533.862|TR0|'09, so it's valid up to the 
20101231142533.862|20101231142536.139|TR0|beginning of 2010, for a 
20101231142536.139|20101231142538.415|TR0|six-year period. So it does 
20101231142538.415|20101231142540.691|TR0|cover a sweep of the war which 
20101231142540.691|20101231142542.968|TR0|hasn't yet turned around. Now, 
20101231142542.968|20101231142545.244|TR0|Obama's policy change came in on 
20101231142545.244|20101231142547.521|TR0|the 1st of December, so there 
20101231142547.521|20101231142549.797|TR0|is, in fact, an overlap. We can 
20101231142549.797|20101231142552.074|TR0|see some of what happens. But 
20101231142552.074|20101231142554.350|TR0|looking back through the data at 
20101231142554.350|20101231142556.627|TR0|successive policy changes - for 
20101231142556.627|20101231142558.903|TR0|example, the policy changes 
20101231142558.903|20101231142601.180|TR0|introduced by McChrystal - what 
20101231142601.180|20101231142603.456|TR0|we don't see is a real change to 
20101231142603.456|20101231142605.733|TR0|how things happen on the ground. 
20101231142605.733|20101231142608.009|TR0|So a policy change is just 
20101231142608.009|20101231142610.286|TR0|words, but what actually happens 
20101231142610.286|20101231142612.562|TR0|on the ground, well, we can see 
20101231142612.562|20101231142614.839|TR0|it from this data. Very little 
20101231142614.839|20101231142617.115|TR0|happens. The U.S. military and 
20101231142617.115|20101231142619.392|TR0|the soldiers in Afghanistan are 
20101231142619.392|20101231142621.668|TR0|a very, very big ship to turn 
20101231142621.668|20101231142623.945|TR0|around. Their interaction with 
20101231142623.945|20101231142626.221|TR0|that environment and with the 
20101231142626.221|20101231142628.498|TR0|Taliban and with the local 
20101231142628.498|20101231142630.774|TR0|population has its own dynamic 
20101231142630.774|20101231142633.051|TR0|that is independent to the 
20101231142633.051|20101231142635.327|TR0|policies that are tried - that 
20101231142635.327|20101231142637.604|TR0|people try and push down from on 
20101231142637.604|20101231142639.880|TR0|high. We can see that, as an 
20101231142639.880|20101231142642.157|TR0|example, when McChrystal tried 
20101231142642.157|20101231142644.433|TR0|to introduce more metrics, more 
20101231142644.433|20101231142646.710|TR0|measurements, of how civilian 
20101231142646.710|20101231142648.986|TR0|casualties were occurring. 
20101231142648.986|20101231142651.263|TR0|Fields pop up in the database 
20101231142651.263|20101231142653.539|TR0|around that time. But we see 
20101231142653.539|20101231142655.815|TR0|that troops that are causing 
20101231142655.815|20101231142658.092|TR0|civilian casualties simply don't 
20101231142658.092|20101231142700.368|TR0|fill out that field, or they lie 
20101231142700.368|20101231142702.645|TR0|about whether the casualties 
20101231142702.645|20101231142704.921|TR0|have occurred, or they 
20101231142704.921|20101231142707.198|TR0|misrepresent whether it was a 
20101231142707.198|20101231142709.474|TR0|civilian casualty versus an 
20101231142709.474|20101231142711.751|TR0|insurgent casualty. That sort of 
20101231142711.751|20101231142714.027|TR0|- that culture and interaction 
20101231142714.027|20101231142716.304|TR0|between Taliban and U.S. forces 
20101231142716.304|20101231142718.580|TR0|and other elements operating in 
20101231142718.580|20101231142720.857|TR0|Afghanistan is very difficult to 
20101231142720.857|20101231142723.133|TR0|change. And so, we don't expect 
20101231142723.133|20101231142725.410|TR0|that the situation, as it stands 
20101231142725.410|20101231142727.686|TR0|now, some seven months after 
20101231142727.686|20101231142729.963|TR0|this data stopped being 
20101231142729.963|20101231142732.239|TR0|collected, would be that 
20101231142732.239|20101231142734.516|TR0|different to the previous six 
20101231142734.516|20101231142736.792|TR0|years, which we can see in the 
20101231142736.792|20101231142739.069|TR0|material that has been released.

20101231142743.622|20101231142745.898|TR0|the charge that WikiLeaks 
20101231142745.898|20101231142748.175|TR0|releasing these documents is a 
20101231142748.175|20101231142750.451|TR0|threat to national security and 
20101231142750.451|20101231142752.728|TR0|people on the ground in 
20101231142752.728|20101231142755.004|TR0|Afghanistan?

20101231142757.281|20101231142759.557|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, this is 
20101231142759.557|20101231142801.834|TR0|a nonsense. First of all, 
20101231142801.834|20101231142804.110|TR0|whenever we hear this term, 
20101231142804.110|20101231142806.387|TR0|"threat to national security," 
20101231142806.387|20101231142808.663|TR0|what are we talking about? It's 
20101231142808.663|20101231142810.939|TR0|time people stop responding to 
20101231142810.939|20101231142813.216|TR0|that question, unless it's well 
20101231142813.216|20101231142815.492|TR0|phrased. Do we mean the national 
20101231142815.492|20101231142817.769|TR0|security, the security of the 
20101231142817.769|20101231142820.045|TR0|entire nation of the United 
20101231142820.045|20101231142822.322|TR0|States? It is clearly an obvious 
20101231142822.322|20101231142824.598|TR0|nonsense that - probably almost 
20101231142824.598|20101231142826.875|TR0|any kind of information could be 
20101231142826.875|20101231142829.151|TR0|a threat to the national 
20101231142829.151|20101231142831.428|TR0|security of the United States. 
20101231142831.428|20101231142833.704|TR0|Now, do we mean threats to a few 
20101231142833.704|20101231142835.981|TR0|soldiers in Afghanistan? That is 
20101231142835.981|20101231142838.257|TR0|a more reasonable question and a 
20101231142838.257|20101231142840.534|TR0|serious one. Well, the material 
20101231142840.534|20101231142842.810|TR0|is seven months old. It doesn't 
20101231142842.810|20101231142845.087|TR0|talk about particular movements 
20101231142845.087|20101231142847.363|TR0|of soldiers now or any ongoing 
20101231142847.363|20101231142849.640|TR0|sort of operation that's going 
20101231142849.640|20101231142851.916|TR0|to occur, so it's not of 
20101231142851.916|20101231142854.193|TR0|tactical significance. But it is 
20101231142854.193|20101231142856.469|TR0|of significance for 
20101231142856.469|20101231142858.746|TR0|investigators. It is of 
20101231142858.746|20101231142901.022|TR0|significance for understanding 
20101231142901.022|20101231142903.299|TR0|the broad sweep of what is 
20101231142903.299|20101231142905.575|TR0|happening in Afghanistan. 
20101231142905.575|20101231142907.852|TR0|Remember, it is this data that 
20101231142907.852|20101231142910.128|TR0|the U.S. military uses 
20101231142910.128|20101231142912.405|TR0|internally to monitor the 
20101231142912.405|20101231142914.681|TR0|situation, that it uses to 
20101231142914.681|20101231142916.958|TR0|develop those aggregate figures 
20101231142916.958|20101231142919.234|TR0|about civilian casualties, 
20101231142919.234|20101231142921.511|TR0|Taliban, the ratio between 
20101231142921.511|20101231142923.787|TR0|killed and wounded, the ration 
20101231142923.787|20101231142926.063|TR0|between killed and detained over 
20101231142926.063|20101231142928.340|TR0|time. Now, all that original 
20101231142928.340|20101231142930.616|TR0|reporting, unmassaged by the 
20101231142930.616|20101231142932.893|TR0|Pentagon press office, is 
20101231142932.893|20101231142935.169|TR0|available to academics,

20101231142955.658|20101231142957.934|TR0|correct. It's some 15,000 that 
20101231142957.934|20101231143000.211|TR0|sometimes mention the names of 
20101231143000.211|20101231143002.487|TR0|informers in Afghanistan. And 
20101231143002.487|20101231143004.764|TR0|because of the security 
20101231143004.764|20101231143007.040|TR0|situation there, we want to look 
20101231143007.040|20101231143009.317|TR0|at these in a bit more detail, 
20101231143009.317|20101231143011.593|TR0|with a bit closer scrutiny, 
20101231143011.593|20101231143013.870|TR0|before we release them. But we 
20101231143013.870|20101231143016.146|TR0|will release them as soon as 
20101231143016.146|20101231143018.423|TR0|possible. In the rare instances 
20101231143018.423|20101231143020.699|TR0|where there are people named who 
20101231143020.699|20101231143022.976|TR0|are innocent informers, we will 
20101231143022.976|20101231143025.252|TR0|redact those names. And once the 
20101231143025.252|20101231143027.529|TR0|security situation in 
20101231143027.529|20101231143029.805|TR0|Afghanistan improves, we will 
20101231143029.805|20101231143032.082|TR0|release the full text of that 
20101231143032.082|20101231143034.358|TR0|material.

20101231143036.635|20101231143038.911|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So you have 
20101231143038.911|20101231143041.188|TR0|released more than 91,000 
20101231143041.188|20101231143043.464|TR0|documents, and you have 15,000 
20101231143043.464|20101231143045.740|TR0|more to go?
20101231143045.740|20101231143048.017|TR0|
20101231143048.017|20101231143050.293|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: There are 
20101231143050.293|20101231143052.570|TR0|more than 91,000 documents in 
20101231143052.570|20101231143054.846|TR0|the full collection that we 
20101231143054.846|20101231143057.123|TR0|shared with our media partners. 
20101231143057.123|20101231143059.399|TR0|We have released to the public 
20101231143059.399|20101231143101.676|TR0|about 76,000, and we will 
20101231143101.676|20101231143103.952|TR0|release another 15,000 over the 
20101231143103.952|20101231143106.229|TR0|coming months.

20101231143108.505|20101231143110.782|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And those who 
20101231143110.782|20101231143113.058|TR0|say, particularly the Obama 
20101231143113.058|20101231143115.335|TR0|administration - Robert Gibbs, 
20101231143115.335|20101231143117.611|TR0|the spokesperson, said President 
20101231143117.611|20101231143119.888|TR0|Obama was alarmed by this 
20101231143119.888|20101231143122.164|TR0|release. Your response?
20101231143122.164|20101231143124.441|TR0|
20101231143124.441|20101231143126.717|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, 
20101231143126.717|20101231143128.994|TR0|organizations that we expose 
20101231143128.994|20101231143131.270|TR0|typically are alarmed by the 
20101231143131.270|20101231143133.547|TR0|material we release, that is 
20101231143133.547|20101231143135.823|TR0|true. Now, if we sort of dissect 
20101231143135.823|20101231143138.100|TR0|that, Robert Gibbs has not read 
20101231143138.100|20101231143140.376|TR0|this material in detail. The 
20101231143140.376|20101231143142.653|TR0|people who know it best at the 
20101231143142.653|20101231143144.929|TR0|moment are us and the three 
20101231143144.929|20101231143147.206|TR0|media organizations that we 
20101231143147.206|20101231143149.482|TR0|worked with. Other people 
20101231143149.482|20101231143151.759|TR0|talking about this really don't 
20101231143151.759|20101231143154.035|TR0|know what they're talking about.
20101231143154.035|20101231143156.312|TR0|
20101231143156.312|20101231143158.588|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You mentioned 
20101231143158.588|20101231143200.864|TR0|the Washington Post. Did you 
20101231143200.864|20101231143203.141|TR0|work with them in releasing 
20101231143203.141|20101231143205.417|TR0|these? They're not included in 
20101231143205.417|20101231143207.694|TR0|those three newspapers.
20101231143207.694|20101231143209.970|TR0|
20101231143209.970|20101231143212.247|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, they're 
20101231143212.247|20101231143214.523|TR0|not included, although we have 
20101231143214.523|20101231143216.800|TR0|had a subsequent overture from 
20101231143216.800|20101231143219.076|TR0|the Post. Last Monday, the Post 
20101231143219.076|20101231143221.353|TR0|produced some really quite fine 
20101231143221.353|20101231143223.629|TR0|work by Dana Priest, looking at 
20101231143223.629|20101231143225.906|TR0|the growth in the U.S. sort of 
20101231143225.906|20101231143228.182|TR0|intelligence contractor 
20101231143228.182|20101231143230.459|TR0|industry. Approximately 900,000 
20101231143230.459|20101231143232.735|TR0|people almost now have 
20101231143232.735|20101231143235.012|TR0|top-secret security clearances, 
20101231143235.012|20101231143237.288|TR0|according to the Post, and 
20101231143237.288|20101231143239.565|TR0|there's almost a bit of a shadow 
20101231143239.565|20101231143241.841|TR0|state developing, which the rest 
20101231143241.841|20101231143244.118|TR0|of the community is not aware of 
20101231143244.118|20101231143246.394|TR0|the work of. That's a good sign 
20101231143246.394|20101231143248.671|TR0|from the Post.
20101231143248.671|20101231143250.947|TR0|
20101231143250.947|20101231143253.224|TR0|But we have seen other things 
20101231143253.224|20101231143255.500|TR0|that are a bit disturbing. For 
20101231143255.500|20101231143257.777|TR0|example, Dana Priest's article 
20101231143257.777|20101231143300.053|TR0|on the CIA black sites had all 
20101231143300.053|20101231143302.330|TR0|the names of the countries 
20101231143302.330|20101231143304.606|TR0|removed from it after a request 
20101231143304.606|20101231143306.883|TR0|by the White House to the 
20101231143306.883|20101231143309.159|TR0|editors of the Post. Similarly, 
20101231143309.159|20101231143311.436|TR0|it is standard Washington Post 
20101231143311.436|20101231143313.712|TR0|practice, whenever Dana Priest 
20101231143313.712|20101231143315.988|TR0|is to reveal a new story showing 
20101231143315.988|20101231143318.265|TR0|significant allegations of 
20101231143318.265|20101231143320.541|TR0|abuse, say, by the CIA, to call 
20101231143320.541|20101231143322.818|TR0|up the press office the night 
20101231143322.818|20101231143325.094|TR0|before to give them the 
20101231143325.094|20101231143327.371|TR0|heads-up, as a courtesy move. 
20101231143327.371|20101231143329.647|TR0|That doesn't seem like 
20101231143329.647|20101231143331.924|TR0|independent journalism to us. It 
20101231143331.924|20101231143334.200|TR0|seems to us that a journalist's 
20101231143334.200|20101231143336.477|TR0|relationship should be with the 
20101231143336.477|20101231143338.753|TR0|public, on the one hand, and 
20101231143338.753|20101231143341.030|TR0|with their sources, on the other 
20101231143341.030|20101231143343.306|TR0|hand, who are providing them 
20101231143343.306|20101231143345.583|TR0|with information to give to the 
20101231143345.583|20101231143347.859|TR0|public. It seems that the Post 
20101231143347.859|20101231143350.136|TR0|is engaging in a sort of an 
20101231143350.136|20101231143352.412|TR0|unclear cooperation with the 
20101231143352.412|20101231143354.689|TR0|very organizations that it's 
20101231143354.689|20101231143356.965|TR0|meant to be policing. So we're a 
20101231143356.965|20101231143359.242|TR0|little bit hesitant about 
20101231143359.242|20101231143401.518|TR0|dealing with them.
20101231143401.518|20101231143403.795|TR0|
20101231143403.795|20101231143406.071|TR0|But the recent Dana Priest 
20101231143406.071|20101231143408.348|TR0|article covering the extensive 
20101231143408.348|20101231143410.624|TR0|expanse of money going into the 
20101231143410.624|20101231143412.901|TR0|top-secret industry in the 
20101231143412.901|20101231143415.177|TR0|United States is encouraging. So 
20101231143415.177|20101231143417.454|TR0|perhaps, if that's a sign of the 
20101231143417.454|20101231143419.730|TR0|movement by the Washington Post 
20101231143419.730|20101231143422.007|TR0|to a more combative form of 
20101231143422.007|20101231143424.283|TR0|journalism, then we would be 
20101231143424.283|20101231143426.560|TR0|happy to work with them.
20101231143426.560|20101231143428.836|TR0|
20101231143428.836|20101231143431.112|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: The total 
20101231143431.112|20101231143433.389|TR0|history of the Afghan war, from 
20101231143433.389|20101231143435.665|TR0|2004 to 2010, that you have 
20101231143435.665|20101231143437.942|TR0|released in these documents, 
20101231143437.942|20101231143440.218|TR0|what isn't included? For 
20101231143440.218|20101231143442.495|TR0|example, U.S. special forces, 
20101231143442.495|20101231143444.771|TR0|CIA?
20101231143444.771|20101231143447.048|TR0|
20101231143447.048|20101231143449.324|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: Yeah. Yeah, 
20101231143449.324|20101231143451.601|TR0|that's an important question you 
20101231143451.601|20101231143453.877|TR0|raise. So it is not everything. 
20101231143453.877|20101231143456.154|TR0|It is most of what the regular 
20101231143456.154|20101231143458.430|TR0|Army was involved in, where they 
20101231143458.430|20101231143500.707|TR0|considered it important enough 
20101231143500.707|20101231143502.983|TR0|to report a significant action. 
20101231143502.983|20101231143505.260|TR0|So that is most deaths that the 
20101231143505.260|20101231143507.536|TR0|U.S. Army was involved in, 
20101231143507.536|20101231143509.813|TR0|except for the ones that some 
20101231143509.813|20101231143512.089|TR0|units possibly didn't report at 
20101231143512.089|20101231143514.366|TR0|all, because they were trying to 
20101231143514.366|20101231143516.642|TR0|cover it up. Now, it doesn't 
20101231143516.642|20101231143518.919|TR0|include most special forces 
20101231143518.919|20101231143521.195|TR0|operations. It does include 
20101231143521.195|20101231143523.472|TR0|some, where the regular Army was 
20101231143523.472|20101231143525.748|TR0|also involved in the same 
20101231143525.748|20101231143528.025|TR0|operation. It doesn't include 
20101231143528.025|20101231143530.301|TR0|CIA operations or CIA drone 
20101231143530.301|20101231143532.578|TR0|attacks, except, once again, 
20101231143532.578|20101231143534.854|TR0|occasionally where the regular 
20101231143534.854|20101231143537.131|TR0|Army was involved in that. It 
20101231143537.131|20101231143539.407|TR0|does include, interestingly, a 
20101231143539.407|20101231143541.684|TR0|number of U.S. embassy cables 
20101231143541.684|20101231143543.960|TR0|that were sent to the Marines, 
20101231143543.960|20101231143546.236|TR0|intelligence and others who were 
20101231143546.236|20101231143548.513|TR0|working in Afghanistan, because 
20101231143548.513|20101231143550.789|TR0|the embassies believed that the 
20101231143550.789|20101231143553.066|TR0|information being revealed was 
20101231143553.066|20101231143555.342|TR0|relevant to the war in 
20101231143555.342|20101231143557.619|TR0|Afghanistan. It does include a 
20101231143557.619|20101231143559.895|TR0|number of reports by informers 
20101231143559.895|20101231143602.172|TR0|or reports by U.S. intelligence 
20101231143602.172|20101231143604.448|TR0|on meetings with, say, governors 
20101231143604.448|20101231143606.725|TR0|in Afghanistan. There's quite a 
20101231143606.725|20101231143609.001|TR0|lot of reports about corruption 
20101231143609.001|20101231143611.278|TR0|within the Afghani government,

20101231143735.508|20101231143737.784|TR0|held in Kuwait itself. A bit of 
20101231143737.784|20101231143740.061|TR0|a problem. Why isn't he being 
20101231143740.061|20101231143742.337|TR0|held in the United States? Is it 
20101231143742.337|20101231143744.614|TR0|to keep him away from effective 
20101231143744.614|20101231143746.890|TR0|legal representation? Is it to

20101231143749.167|20101231143751.443|TR0|We're not sure. But there 
20101231143751.443|20101231143753.720|TR0|doesn't seem to be any reason 
20101231143753.720|20101231143755.996|TR0|why he could not be transferred 
20101231143755.996|20101231143758.273|TR0|to the United States. We 
20101231143758.273|20101231143800.549|TR0|obviously cannot say whether he 
20101231143800.549|20101231143802.826|TR0|is our source. We in fact 
20101231143802.826|20101231143805.102|TR0|specialize in not knowing the 
20101231143805.102|20101231143807.379|TR0|names of our sources. But 
20101231143807.379|20101231143809.655|TR0|nonetheless, he is a young man 
20101231143809.655|20101231143811.932|TR0|being held in dire circumstances 
20101231143811.932|20101231143814.208|TR0|on the allegation that he 
20101231143814.208|20101231143816.485|TR0|supplied this material to the

20101231143821.037|20101231143823.314|TR0|we are trying to raise money for 
20101231143823.314|20101231143825.590|TR0|his legal representation. We 
20101231143825.590|20101231143827.867|TR0|have committed $50,000 of our 
20101231143827.867|20101231143830.143|TR0|own funds, that if the general 
20101231143830.143|20101231143832.420|TR0|public could contribute or other 
20101231143832.420|20101231143834.696|TR0|people could contribute, I know 
20101231143834.696|20101231143836.973|TR0|that his military counsel would 
20101231143836.973|20101231143839.249|TR0|find that of significant value. 
20101231143839.249|20101231143841.526|TR0|The lawyers that we have spoken

20101231143843.802|20101231143846.079|TR0|will cost $200,000, assuming 
20101231143846.079|20101231143848.355|TR0|that it's a regular sort of 
20101231143848.355|20101231143850.632|TR0|trial, it goes ahead. People can

20101231144217.792|20101231144220.068|TR0|published some 390,000 
20101231144220.068|20101231144222.345|TR0|classified U.S. documents on the 
20101231144222.345|20101231144224.621|TR0|war in Iraq. He began by talking 
20101231144224.621|20101231144226.898|TR0|about the revelations in the 
20101231144226.898|20101231144229.174|TR0|documents.

20101231144231.451|20101231144233.727|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: These 
20101231144233.727|20101231144236.004|TR0|documents cover the periods of 
20101231144236.004|20101231144238.280|TR0|2004 to the beginning of 2010. 
20101231144238.280|20101231144240.557|TR0|It is the most accurate 
20101231144240.557|20101231144242.833|TR0|description of a war to have 
20101231144242.833|20101231144245.110|TR0|ever been released. Within them, 
20101231144245.110|20101231144247.386|TR0|we can see 285,000 casualties. 
20101231144247.386|20101231144249.663|TR0|That's added up, report by 
20101231144249.663|20101231144251.939|TR0|report. That's each casualty, 
20101231144251.939|20101231144254.216|TR0|where it happened, when it 
20101231144254.216|20101231144256.492|TR0|happened, and who was involved, 
20101231144256.492|20101231144258.769|TR0|according to internal U.S. 
20101231144258.769|20101231144301.045|TR0|military reporting.

20101231144303.322|20101231144305.598|TR0|Now, looking at particular 
20101231144305.598|20101231144307.875|TR0|groups of casualties, we can 
20101231144307.875|20101231144310.151|TR0|see, for example, over 600 
20101231144310.151|20101231144312.428|TR0|civilians killed at checkpoint 
20101231144312.428|20101231144314.704|TR0|killings, including 30 children, 
20101231144314.704|20101231144316.981|TR0|previously - mostly previously 
20101231144316.981|20101231144319.257|TR0|unreported, that three-quarters 
20101231144319.257|20101231144321.533|TR0|of those killed at checkpoint 
20101231144321.533|20101231144323.810|TR0|killings, according to the 
20101231144323.810|20101231144326.086|TR0|United States military itself, 
20101231144326.086|20101231144328.363|TR0|were civilians, and only 
20101231144328.363|20101231144330.639|TR0|one-quarter, according to the 
20101231144330.639|20101231144332.916|TR0|U.S. military internal 
20101231144332.916|20101231144335.192|TR0|reporting, were insurgents.
20101231144335.192|20101231144337.469|TR0|
20101231144337.469|20101231144339.745|TR0|We see 284 reports covering 
20101231144339.745|20101231144342.022|TR0|torture or other forms of 
20101231144342.022|20101231144344.298|TR0|prisoner abuse by coalition 
20101231144344.298|20101231144346.575|TR0|forces, covering 300 different 
20101231144346.575|20101231144348.851|TR0|people. We see over a thousand 
20101231144348.851|20101231144351.128|TR0|reports of torture and other 
20101231144351.128|20101231144353.404|TR0|prisoner abuse by the Iraqi 
20101231144353.404|20101231144355.681|TR0|state itself, many or most of 
20101231144355.681|20101231144357.957|TR0|those receiving no meaningful 
20101231144357.957|20101231144400.234|TR0|investigation. I heard in your 
20101231144400.234|20101231144402.510|TR0|introduction that the Pentagon 
20101231144402.510|20101231144404.787|TR0|claims that the Iraqi government 
20101231144404.787|20101231144407.063|TR0|is responsible for this, but in 
20101231144407.063|20101231144409.340|TR0|international law, it is the 
20101231144409.340|20101231144411.616|TR0|person or government or 
20101231144411.616|20101231144413.893|TR0|organization that has effective 
20101231144413.893|20101231144416.169|TR0|control that is responsible. And 
20101231144416.169|20101231144418.446|TR0|certainly, before the technical 
20101231144418.446|20101231144420.722|TR0|legal handover from the 
20101231144420.722|20101231144422.999|TR0|Coalition Provisional Authority 
20101231144422.999|20101231144425.275|TR0|to the Iraqi government, it is 
20101231144425.275|20101231144427.552|TR0|clear that the United States and 
20101231144427.552|20101231144429.828|TR0|other coalition forces were the 
20101231144429.828|20101231144432.105|TR0|effective, legally responsible 
20101231144432.105|20101231144434.381|TR0|group for those. We see in the 
20101231144434.381|20101231144436.657|TR0|United Kingdom, Phil Shiner and 
20101231144436.657|20101231144438.934|TR0|his group Public Interest 
20101231144438.934|20101231144441.210|TR0|Lawyers, Amnesty International, 
20101231144441.210|20101231144443.487|TR0|and in New York, Human Rights 
20101231144443.487|20101231144445.763|TR0|Watch, calling for investigation 
20101231144445.763|20101231144448.040|TR0|and, in some cases, lawsuits 
20101231144448.040|20101231144450.316|TR0|against coalition forces for 
20101231144450.316|20101231144452.593|TR0|wrongful death.
20101231144452.593|20101231144454.869|TR0|
20101231144454.869|20101231144457.146|TR0|There's other aspects, as well. 
20101231144457.146|20101231144459.422|TR0|We can see the involvement of 
20101231144459.422|20101231144501.699|TR0|Iran in Iraq with various forms 
20101231144501.699|20101231144503.975|TR0|of support given to Shia groups. 
20101231144503.975|20101231144506.252|TR0|We can see the corruption 
20101231144506.252|20101231144508.528|TR0|present in the Maliki 
20101231144508.528|20101231144510.805|TR0|government, including what 
20101231144510.805|20101231144513.081|TR0|appears to be a special forces - 
20101231144513.081|20101231144515.358|TR0|Iraqi special forces - squad 
20101231144515.358|20101231144517.634|TR0|personally responsible to Maliki 
20101231144517.634|20101231144519.911|TR0|and not tasked by the Iraqi army 
20101231144519.911|20101231144522.187|TR0|itself that has been going 
20101231144522.187|20101231144524.464|TR0|around and strong-arming and 
20101231144524.464|20101231144526.740|TR0|possibly assassinating opponents.
20101231144526.740|20101231144529.017|TR0|
20101231144529.017|20101231144531.293|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And how did you 
20101231144531.293|20101231144533.570|TR0|get these documents, and who 
20101231144533.570|20101231144535.846|TR0|wrote them?
20101231144535.846|20101231144538.123|TR0|
20101231144538.123|20101231144540.399|TR0|>> JULIAN ASSANGE: The documents 
20101231144540.399|20101231144542.676|TR0|are what is referred to in 
20101231144542.676|20101231144544.952|TR0|military terminology as 
20101231144544.952|20101231144547.229|TR0|"significant action reports," so 
20101231144547.229|20101231144549.505|TR0|those are field reports by the 
20101231144549.505|20101231144551.782|TR0|U.S. Army radioed back to base 
20101231144551.782|20101231144554.058|TR0|of everything those soldiers and 
20101231144554.058|20101231144556.334|TR0|commanders considered 
20101231144556.334|20101231144558.611|TR0|significant. So, that is the 
20101231144558.611|20101231144600.887|TR0|launch of an operation; the 
20101231144600.887|20101231144603.164|TR0|dropping of a bomb; the arrest 
20101231144603.164|20101231144605.440|TR0|or detainment of persons, of 
20101231144605.440|20101231144607.717|TR0|which there are approximately 
20101231144607.717|20101231144609.993|TR0|174,000 cases documented in this 
20101231144609.993|20101231144612.270|TR0|material; significant key 
20101231144612.270|20101231144614.546|TR0|leadership engagements, so the 
20101231144614.546|20101231144616.823|TR0|meetings with some key leaders 
20101231144616.823|20101231144619.099|TR0|and the U.S. Army. It is, if you 
20101231144619.099|20101231144621.376|TR0|like, what the U.S. Army and the 
20101231144621.376|20101231144623.652|TR0|Pentagon use as its raw 
20101231144623.652|20101231144625.929|TR0|ingredients to come up with 
20101231144625.929|20101231144628.205|TR0|policy and understand how the 
20101231144628.205|20101231144630.482|TR0|war was progressing.
20101231144630.482|20101231144632.758|TR0|
20101231144632.758|20101231144635.035|TR0|Clearly this material must have 
20101231144635.035|20101231144637.311|TR0|come from someone or some 
20101231144637.311|20101231144639.588|TR0|persons within the Pentagon or 
20101231144639.588|20101231144641.864|TR0|within the United States 
20101231144641.864|20101231144644.141|TR0|military. And it's worth 
20101231144644.141|20101231144646.417|TR0|pointing out that there are 
20101231144646.417|20101231144648.694|TR0|clearly good people in the 
20101231144648.694|20101231144650.970|TR0|Pentagon who were not happy with 
20101231144650.970|20101231144653.247|TR0|the progress of the Iraq war. 
20101231144653.247|20101231144655.523|TR0|And those people have chosen to

20101231144657.800|20101231144700.076|TR0|and, presumably, have chosen to 
20101231144700.076|20101231144702.353|TR0|provide us with other material 
20101231144702.353|20101231144704.629|TR0|that we have released over the

20101231144819.753|20101231144822.030|TR0|Ellsberg is perhaps this 
20101231144822.030|20101231144824.306|TR0|country's most famous 
20101231144824.306|20101231144826.582|TR0|whistleblower. In 1971 he leaked 
20101231144826.582|20101231144828.859|TR0|the Pentagon Papers, the secret 
20101231144828.859|20101231144831.135|TR0|history of the U.S. involvement 
20101231144831.135|20101231144833.412|TR0|in Vietnam. He's been speaking 
20101231144833.412|20101231144835.688|TR0|out in support of Julian Assange 
20101231144835.688|20101231144837.965|TR0|and WikiLeaks. He spoke about 
20101231144837.965|20101231144840.241|TR0|the targeting of Julian Assange.
20101231144840.241|20101231144842.518|TR0|
20101231144842.518|20101231144844.794|TR0|>> DANIEL ELLSBERG: Well, as I 
20101231144844.794|20101231144847.071|TR0|listened to Attorney General 
20101231144847.071|20101231144849.347|TR0|Holder on your program just now, 
20101231144849.347|20101231144851.624|TR0|I realize that he's in the same 
20101231144851.624|20101231144853.900|TR0|position of that Attorney 
20101231144853.900|20101231144856.177|TR0|General Mitchell was in 40 years 
20101231144856.177|20101231144858.453|TR0|ago with the Pentagon Papers 
20101231144858.453|20101231144900.730|TR0|when they came out. We have an 
20101231144900.730|20101231144903.006|TR0|act of free speech, of free 
20101231144903.006|20101231144905.283|TR0|press, of informing the public, 
20101231144905.283|20101231144907.559|TR0|an act in search of a crime, in 
20101231144907.559|20101231144909.836|TR0|search of a law that would call 
20101231144909.836|20101231144912.112|TR0|it criminal. No one had ever 
20101231144912.112|20101231144914.389|TR0|been prosecuted for what I had 
20101231144914.389|20101231144916.665|TR0|done then, revealing top 
20101231144916.665|20101231144918.942|TR0|secrets. There had been many 
20101231144918.942|20101231144921.218|TR0|leaks in the past, then as now, 
20101231144921.218|20101231144923.495|TR0|and no one had ever been 
20101231144923.495|20101231144925.771|TR0|prosecuted. I was the first. The 
20101231144925.771|20101231144928.048|TR0|act they found was the Espionage 
20101231144928.048|20101231144930.324|TR0|Act, which was passed in 1917, 
20101231144930.324|20101231144932.601|TR0|was never intended to work as an 
20101231144932.601|20101231144934.877|TR0|Official Secrets Act, as in 
20101231144934.877|20101231144937.154|TR0|England, which would criminalize 
20101231144937.154|20101231144939.430|TR0|any release of classified 
20101231144939.430|20101231144941.706|TR0|information. But they tried it 
20101231144941.706|20101231144943.983|TR0|on me. I was faced with a 
20101231144943.983|20101231144946.259|TR0|possible 115 years in prison, 
20101231144946.259|20101231144948.536|TR0|which is the kind of sentence 
20101231144948.536|20101231144950.812|TR0|they would love to hang on 
20101231144950.812|20101231144953.089|TR0|Bradley Manning, who is accused 
20101231144953.089|20101231144955.365|TR0|of being the leaker in this 
20101231144955.365|20101231144957.642|TR0|case. We don't know if he was, 
20101231144957.642|20101231144959.918|TR0|but I'm going to give him credit 
20101231144959.918|20101231145002.195|TR0|for it, since I regard it as a 
20101231145002.195|20101231145004.471|TR0|very admirable act, for which I 
20101231145004.471|20101231145006.748|TR0|thank him at this time. And if 
20101231145006.748|20101231145009.024|TR0|he's - if the credit is not due, 
20101231145009.024|20101231145011.301|TR0|it's due to the source, whoever 
20101231145011.301|20101231145013.577|TR0|that was.
20101231145013.577|20101231145015.854|TR0|
20101231145015.854|20101231145018.130|TR0|So, I think, actually, what this 
20101231145018.130|20101231145020.407|TR0|is about, to a large extent, is 
20101231145020.407|20101231145022.683|TR0|trying to, once again, to 
20101231145022.683|20101231145024.960|TR0|instate the Espionage Act as if 
20101231145024.960|20101231145027.236|TR0|it were an Official Secrets Act, 
20101231145027.236|20101231145029.513|TR0|use it to cut down, close off 
20101231145029.513|20101231145031.789|TR0|unauthorized disclosures to the 
20101231145031.789|20101231145034.066|TR0|American public from inside the 
20101231145034.066|20101231145036.342|TR0|government, and also to 
20101231145036.342|20101231145038.619|TR0|accompany that with a 
20101231145038.619|20101231145040.895|TR0|legislative move to supplement 
20101231145040.895|20101231145043.172|TR0|it with an act that is 
20101231145043.172|20101231145045.448|TR0|explicitly an Official Secrets 
20101231145045.448|20101231145047.725|TR0|Act, one that clearly Congress 
20101231145047.725|20101231145050.001|TR0|intends to criminalize any 
20101231145050.001|20101231145052.278|TR0|release of classified 
20101231145052.278|20101231145054.554|TR0|information, such as the one you 
20101231145054.554|20101231145056.830|TR0|were just quoting to - in 
20101231145056.830|20101231145059.107|TR0|Cancun. I was interested that 
20101231145059.107|20101231145101.383|TR0|the recent release - Amy, you 
20101231145101.383|20101231145103.660|TR0|must have been reading it, 
20101231145103.660|20101231145105.936|TR0|actually, unlike most people, 
20101231145105.936|20101231145108.213|TR0|and found something of note in 
20101231145108.213|20101231145110.489|TR0|the cables that were released by 
20101231145110.489|20101231145112.766|TR0|the New York Times, given to 
20101231145112.766|20101231145115.042|TR0|them by WikiLeaks, and 
20101231145115.042|20101231145117.319|TR0|eventually by the source, about 
20101231145117.319|20101231145119.595|TR0|what Bradley Manning is reported 
20101231145119.595|20101231145121.872|TR0|to have said, the U.S. throwing 
20101231145121.872|20101231145124.148|TR0|its weight around against the 
20101231145124.148|20101231145126.425|TR0|poor countries of the world to 
20101231145126.425|20101231145128.701|TR0|exploit their resources, 
20101231145128.701|20101231145130.978|TR0|something that he said he was 
20101231145130.978|20101231145133.254|TR0|determined to expose to the 
20101231145133.254|20101231145135.531|TR0|American people.
20101231145135.531|20101231145137.807|TR0|
20101231145137.807|20101231145140.084|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: In the letter 
20101231145140.084|20101231145142.360|TR0|that you've joined with others, 
20101231145142.360|20101231145144.637|TR0|very significantly among them 
20101231145144.637|20101231145146.913|TR0|Larry Wilkerson, the former 
20101231145146.913|20101231145149.190|TR0|chief of staff of then-Secretary 
20101231145149.190|20101231145151.466|TR0|of State Colin Powell, you are 
20101231145151.466|20101231145153.743|TR0|fiercely critical of the media. 
20101231145153.743|20101231145156.019|TR0|Talk about the role that it has 
20101231145156.019|20101231145158.296|TR0|played.
20101231145158.296|20101231145200.572|TR0|
20101231145200.572|20101231145202.849|TR0|>> DANIEL ELLSBERG: Well, in 
20101231145202.849|20101231145205.125|TR0|this case, as in the Pentagon 
20101231145205.125|20101231145207.402|TR0|Papers, I do give the New York 
20101231145207.402|20101231145209.678|TR0|Times credit for working with 
20101231145209.678|20101231145211.954|TR0|these materials and presenting 
20101231145211.954|20101231145214.231|TR0|material to their readers. And 
20101231145214.231|20101231145216.507|TR0|in fact, there really - if they 
20101231145216.507|20101231145218.784|TR0|find a crime, or if they invent 
20101231145218.784|20101231145221.060|TR0|a crime or pass a crime - 
20101231145221.060|20101231145223.337|TR0|criminal law that would cover 
20101231145223.337|20101231145225.613|TR0|WikiLeaks, it will cover the New 
20101231145225.613|20101231145227.890|TR0|York Times, and you, Democracy 
20101231145227.890|20101231145230.166|TR0|Now!, and anyone who presents 
20101231145230.166|20101231145232.443|TR0|news that in part reflects 
20101231145232.443|20101231145234.719|TR0|leaks, unauthorized disclosures 
20101231145234.719|20101231145236.996|TR0|from within the government.
20101231145236.996|20101231145239.272|TR0|
20101231145239.272|20101231145241.549|TR0|Actually, the wording of the 
20101231145241.549|20101231145243.825|TR0|Espionage Act, which, as I say, 
20101231145243.825|20101231145246.102|TR0|was not intended for this 
20101231145246.102|20101231145248.378|TR0|purpose, but the wording of it 
20101231145248.378|20101231145250.655|TR0|is so broad that it applies to 
20101231145250.655|20101231145252.931|TR0|readers of this classified 
20101231145252.931|20101231145255.208|TR0|information. If they are 
20101231145255.208|20101231145257.484|TR0|unauthorized possessors, which 
20101231145257.484|20101231145259.761|TR0|they are from the point of view 
20101231145259.761|20101231145302.037|TR0|of the government, then they 
20101231145302.037|20101231145304.314|TR0|can't discuss it. They can't 
20101231145304.314|20101231145306.590|TR0|join chat logs, let's say, 
20101231145306.590|20101231145308.867|TR0|discussing it, and they have to, 
20101231145308.867|20101231145311.143|TR0|quote, "return" it, which is 
20101231145311.143|20101231145313.420|TR0|quite challenging with digital 
20101231145313.420|20101231145315.696|TR0|material like this. But they'd 
20101231145315.696|20101231145317.973|TR0|have to return their copy of the 
20101231145317.973|20101231145320.249|TR0|New York Times, I guess, to the 
20101231145320.249|20101231145322.526|TR0|Justice Department. That 
20101231145322.526|20101231145324.802|TR0|actually is in line with what 
20101231145324.802|20101231145327.079|TR0|the government has been saying 
20101231145327.079|20101231145329.355|TR0|right now, directing its 
20101231145329.355|20101231145331.631|TR0|employees that they cannot 
20101231145331.631|20101231145333.908|TR0|download WikiLeaks or the New 
20101231145333.908|20101231145336.184|TR0|York Times sites that reports 
20101231145336.184|20101231145338.461|TR0|the WikiLeaks onto their 
20101231145338.461|20101231145340.737|TR0|computers at work or at home - 
20101231145340.737|20101231145343.014|TR0|just where that leaves their 
20101231145343.014|20101231145345.290|TR0|family members, for instance. Is 
20101231145345.290|20101231145347.567|TR0|it possible that it could be 
20101231145347.567|20101231145349.843|TR0|discussed around the family 
20101231145349.843|20101231145352.120|TR0|table, if someone else has 
20101231145352.120|20101231145354.396|TR0|downloaded it?
20101231145354.396|20101231145356.673|TR0|
20101231145356.673|20101231145358.949|TR0|We're in an absurd position here 
20101231145358.949|20101231145401.226|TR0|with a close down of public 
20101231145401.226|20101231145403.502|TR0|discussion of official matters, 
20101231145403.502|20101231145405.779|TR0|very similar to that of China. 
20101231145405.779|20101231145408.055|TR0|In fact, I even wonder whether 
20101231145408.055|20101231145410.332|TR0|there's a rule that absurd in 
20101231145410.332|20101231145412.608|TR0|China. And that's the kind of

20101231145421.714|20101231145423.991|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Julian Assange 
20101231145423.991|20101231145426.267|TR0|has been the target of 
20101231145426.267|20101231145428.544|TR0|assassination and arrest calls 
20101231145428.544|20101231145430.820|TR0|from a number of U.S. 
20101231145430.820|20101231145433.097|TR0|politicians and commentators 
20101231145433.097|20101231145435.373|TR0|since the release of the 
20101231145435.373|20101231145437.650|TR0|diplomatic cables. This week, a 
20101231145437.650|20101231145439.926|TR0|Democratic Party consultant, Fox 
20101231145439.926|20101231145442.203|TR0|Business commentator Bob Beckel, 
20101231145442.203|20101231145444.479|TR0|called for illegally shooting 
20101231145444.479|20101231145446.755|TR0|Assange. This is what he said.
20101231145446.755|20101231145449.032|TR0|
20101231145449.032|20101231145451.308|TR0|>> BOB BECKEL: We've got special 
20101231145451.308|20101231145453.585|TR0|ops forces. I mean, a dead man 
20101231145453.585|20101231145455.861|TR0|can't leak stuff. This guy's a 
20101231145455.861|20101231145458.138|TR0|traitor, a treasonous, and he 
20101231145458.138|20101231145500.414|TR0|has broken every law of the 
20101231145500.414|20101231145502.691|TR0|United States. The guy ought to 
20101231145502.691|20101231145504.967|TR0|be - and I'm not for the death 
20101231145504.967|20101231145507.244|TR0|penalty, so if I'm not for the 
20101231145507.244|20101231145509.520|TR0|death penalty, there's only one 
20101231145509.520|20101231145511.797|TR0|way to do it: illegally shoot 
20101231145511.797|20101231145514.073|TR0|the son of a [bleep].

20101231145516.350|20101231145518.626|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: OK, now, that's 
20101231145518.626|20101231145520.903|TR0|Bob Beckel. That's Bob Beckel, 
20101231145520.903|20101231145523.179|TR0|Dan Ellsberg, on Fox, right? Bob 
20101231145523.179|20101231145525.456|TR0|Beckel, who was what? What was 
20101231145525.456|20101231145527.732|TR0|he? The campaign manager for 
20101231145527.732|20101231145530.009|TR0|Walter Mondale in 1984, in the 
20101231145530.009|20101231145532.285|TR0|presidential campaign of Walter 
20101231145532.285|20101231145534.562|TR0|Mondale?

20101231145536.838|20101231145539.115|TR0|>> DANIEL ELLSBERG: Well, it's 
20101231145539.115|20101231145541.391|TR0|appalling. I didn't remember 
20101231145541.391|20101231145543.668|TR0|that, but it's appalling. You 
20101231145543.668|20101231145545.944|TR0|are reminding us that it's not 
20101231145545.944|20101231145548.221|TR0|only Republicans like Sarah 
20101231145548.221|20101231145550.497|TR0|Palin and others, and Peter 
20101231145550.497|20101231145552.774|TR0|King, who will be a high - have 
20101231145552.774|20101231145555.050|TR0|high position in the House in 
20101231145555.050|20101231145557.327|TR0|the next term, who are calling 
20101231145557.327|20101231145559.603|TR0|for this kind of thing. In my 
20101231145559.603|20101231145601.879|TR0|case - I'm sure, by the way, 
20101231145601.879|20101231145604.156|TR0|that if I released the Pentagon 
20101231145604.156|20101231145606.432|TR0|Papers today, the same rhetoric 
20101231145606.432|20101231145608.709|TR0|and the same calls would be made 
20101231145608.709|20101231145610.985|TR0|about me at this time, the same 
20101231145610.985|20101231145613.262|TR0|material, same instigations. I 
20101231145613.262|20101231145615.538|TR0|would be called not only a 
20101231145615.538|20101231145617.815|TR0|traitor, which I was then, which 
20101231145617.815|20101231145620.091|TR0|was false and slanderous, but I 
20101231145620.091|20101231145622.368|TR0|would be called a terrorist, as 
20101231145622.368|20101231145624.644|TR0|a matter of fact. Now, that's 
20101231145624.644|20101231145626.921|TR0|the word today for someone who 
20101231145626.921|20101231145629.197|TR0|is beyond the pale of any 
20101231145629.197|20101231145631.474|TR0|rights, of any rights of 
20101231145631.474|20101231145633.750|TR0|citizenship or any human rights, 
20101231145633.750|20101231145636.027|TR0|someone who can be just dealt 
20101231145636.027|20101231145638.303|TR0|with summarily like that. The 
20101231145638.303|20101231145640.580|TR0|reason for calling for illegal 
20101231145640.580|20101231145642.856|TR0|shooting, which is an odd and 
20101231145642.856|20101231145645.133|TR0|unusual call, is, as I said at 
20101231145645.133|20101231145647.409|TR0|the beginning, because our legal 
20101231145647.409|20101231145649.686|TR0|system, with its glorious First 
20101231145649.686|20101231145651.962|TR0|Amendment, we don't have a law 
20101231145651.962|20101231145654.239|TR0|that makes it clearly illegal to 
20101231145654.239|20101231145656.515|TR0|do what - the truth telling that 
20101231145656.515|20101231145658.792|TR0|WikiLeaks and New York Times and 
20101231145658.792|20101231145701.068|TR0|Julian Assange has done. Assange 
20101231145701.068|20101231145703.345|TR0|and Bradley Manning are no more 
20101231145703.345|20101231145705.621|TR0|terrorists than I am, and I'm 
20101231145705.621|20101231145707.898|TR0|not.
20101231145707.898|20101231145710.174|TR0|
20101231145710.174|20101231145712.451|TR0|And that is a - it's appalling 
20101231145712.451|20101231145714.727|TR0|that our conversation after 
20101231145714.727|20101231145717.003|TR0|9/11, in the last ten years, has 
20101231145717.003|20101231145719.280|TR0|reached a point where what Nixon 
20101231145719.280|20101231145721.556|TR0|did to me covertly can now be 
20101231145721.556|20101231145723.833|TR0|called for and actually done 
20101231145723.833|20101231145726.109|TR0|openly and very specifically. 
20101231145726.109|20101231145728.386|TR0|Nixon brought a dozen Cuban 
20101231145728.386|20101231145730.662|TR0|American emigres, Bay of Pigs 
20101231145730.662|20101231145732.939|TR0|veterans, up from Miami to at 
20101231145732.939|20101231145735.215|TR0|least beat me up. The words were 
20101231145735.215|20101231145737.492|TR0|"incapacitate Ellsberg totally," 
20101231145737.492|20101231145739.768|TR0|which covers the word "kill," 
20101231145739.768|20101231145742.045|TR0|which, as their prosecutor said 
20101231145742.045|20101231145744.321|TR0|to me at the time, these guys, 
20101231145744.321|20101231145746.598|TR0|who were CIA assets, they don't 
20101231145746.598|20101231145748.874|TR0|use the word "kill." They avoid 
20101231145748.874|20101231145751.151|TR0|it. They use words like 
20101231145751.151|20101231145753.427|TR0|"neutralize" and "eliminate" and 
20101231145753.427|20101231145755.704|TR0|"with extreme prejudice," 
20101231145755.704|20101231145757.980|TR0|"terminate," that sort of thing. 
20101231145757.980|20101231145800.257|TR0|They avoided the word "kill." I 
20101231145800.257|20101231145802.533|TR0|notice that the change now is 
20101231145802.533|20101231145804.810|TR0|that not only is that, which was 
20101231145804.810|20101231145807.086|TR0|a covert action, which actually 
20101231145807.086|20101231145809.363|TR0|was critical in bringing Nixon 
20101231145809.363|20101231145811.639|TR0|down because it was recognized 
20101231145811.639|20101231145813.916|TR0|as not only illegal, but really 
20101231145813.916|20101231145816.192|TR0|against American values in a 
20101231145816.192|20101231145818.469|TR0|fundamental sense, that has now 
20101231145818.469|20101231145820.745|TR0|become something you can talk 
20101231145820.745|20101231145823.022|TR0|about quite openly. And even the 
20101231145823.022|20101231145825.298|TR0|President can refer to special 
20101231145825.298|20101231145827.575|TR0|operations teams worldwide whose 
20101231145827.575|20101231145829.851|TR0|work is to capture or kill. The 
20101231145829.851|20101231145832.127|TR0|word "kill" is no longer avoided 
20101231145832.127|20101231145834.404|TR0|in these circles.

20101231145841.233|20101231145843.510|TR0|that does it for our show, but
