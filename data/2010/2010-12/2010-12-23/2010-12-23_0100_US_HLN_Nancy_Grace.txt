20101223010801.000|20101223010803.000|CC1|THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LARGE      
20101223010803.000|20101223010805.000|CC1|ENOUGH FOR HER TO HIDE A BODY

20101223010933.000|20101223010935.000|CC1|AND I FEEL SO HORRIBLE FOR THAT 
20101223010935.000|20101223010936.000|CC1|GIRL BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
20101223010936.000|20101223010937.000|CC1|SHE WENT THROUGH.               
20101223010937.000|20101223010938.000|CC1|WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE SAW.     
20101223010938.000|20101223010939.000|CC1|IT'S VERY POSSIBLE SHE'S GOING

20101223010951.000|20101223010952.000|CC1|LAWYER, BEFORE YOU SAY THAT SHE 
20101223010952.000|20101223010955.000|CC1|HAS MENTAL ISSUES, I'M GOING TO 
20101223010955.000|20101223010957.000|CC1|SAY SHE WAS PRETTY SMART.       
20101223010957.000|20101223010959.000|CC1|YOU KNOW, DANIEL?               
20101223010959.000|20101223011000.000|CC1|BECAUSE NORMALLY PEOPLE TAKE A  
20101223011000.000|20101223011002.000|CC1|BODY AND THEY PUT IT IN A       
20101223011002.000|20101223011005.000|CC1|DUMPSTER OR THEY PUT IT IN A    
20101223011005.000|20101223011006.000|CC1|FIELD OR A LONG WAYS AWAY WHERE 
20101223011006.000|20101223011008.000|CC1|NO ONE CAN FIND IT.             
20101223011008.000|20101223011009.000|CC1|SHE KEPT IT WITH HER.           
20101223011009.000|20101223011010.000|CC1|WHO'S GOING TO FIND IT IF YOU   
20101223011010.000|20101223011012.000|CC1|KEEP IT WITH YOU?               
20101223011012.000|20101223011014.000|CC1|>> YEAH, BUT JEAN, SHE'S NOT    
20101223011014.000|20101223011015.000|CC1|TRYING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS

20101223011023.000|20101223011024.000|CC1|THAT MAKES NO SENSE.            
20101223011024.000|20101223011025.000|CC1|THAT'S INFLAMMATORY.            
20101223011025.000|20101223011027.000|CC1|I THINK SHE'LL BE FOUND TO BE

20101223011029.000|20101223011031.000|CC1|IT'S A TRAGEDY, BUT IT'S REALLY 
20101223011031.000|20101223011033.000|CC1|A TRAGEDY THAT WE DIDN'T FIND   
20101223011033.000|20101223011035.000|CC1|OUT ABOUT HER PROBLEM AND HELP  
20101223011035.000|20101223011036.000|CC1|HER BEFORE WE LOST THIS LITTLE

20101223011036.000|20101223011038.000|CC1|>> WELL, ALLEN RIPKA, SHE SAID  
20101223011038.000|20101223011040.000|CC1|TO INVESTIGATORS, YOU KNOW WHAT?
20101223011040.000|20101223011042.000|CC1|I COULDN'T TAKE THE TEMPER

20101223011043.000|20101223011046.000|CC1|SO I KILLED MY CHILD.           
20101223011046.000|20101223011048.000|CC1|THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE THAT   
20101223011048.000|20101223011049.000|CC1|KNEW RIGHT FROM WRONG AND JUST  
20101223011049.000|20101223011051.000|CC1|DIDN'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED.     
20101223011051.000|20101223011053.000|CC1|>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S         
20101223011053.000|20101223011054.000|CC1|CERTAINLY AN ADMISSION THAT     
20101223011054.000|20101223011055.000|CC1|COULD BE USED AGAINST HER IN A  
20101223011055.000|20101223011056.000|CC1|COURT OF LAW.                   
20101223011056.000|20101223011057.000|CC1|WHAT I SAY IS SHE MAY NOT HAVE

20101223011059.000|20101223011059.000|CC1|THE CHILD.

20101223011100.000|20101223011102.000|CC1|COME UP WITH ANOTHER EXCUSE.    
20101223011102.000|20101223011104.000|CC1|I GAVE THE BABY OIL AND VINEGAR.
20101223011104.000|20101223011107.000|CC1|BUT THE BABY HAD A BROKEN NECK. 
20101223011107.000|20101223011110.000|CC1|WHY TELL THEM SOMETHING THAT    
20101223011110.000|20101223011110.000|CC1|THEY -- THAT SHE KNOWS THEY'RE  
20101223011110.000|20101223011113.000|CC1|GOING TO FIND OUT ISN'T TRUE?

20101223011117.000|20101223011119.000|CC1|>> THE FACT IS THAT THERE IS AN

20101223011120.000|20101223011122.000|CC1|AND WAS THIS EVEN A TRUE
