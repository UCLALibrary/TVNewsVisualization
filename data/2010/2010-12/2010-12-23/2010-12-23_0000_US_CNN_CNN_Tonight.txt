20101223000007.000|20101223000009.000|TR0|JOHN KING, CNN HOST:  Thanks, Wolf.  Good 
20101223000009.000|20101223000011.000|TR0|evening, everyone. Wow, it is hard to know 
20101223000011.000|20101223000013.000|TR0|where to start tonight.  Congress is done 
20101223000013.000|20101223000015.000|TR0|for the year after a huge final day 
20101223000015.000|20101223000017.000|TR0|ratifying a new nuclear arms treaty with 
20101223000017.000|20101223000020.000|TR0|Russia and creating a new program to help 
20101223000020.000|20101223000022.000|TR0|9/11 first responders deal with health 
20101223000022.000|20101223000024.000|TR0|crisis.

20101223000026.000|20101223000028.000|TR0|Many Republicans think one month after an 
20101223000028.000|20101223000031.000|TR0|election they won big, but that they got 
20101223000031.000|20101223000033.000|TR0|snookered by Democrats even though they 
20101223000033.000|20101223000035.000|TR0|won those elections so big.  In an 
20101223000035.000|20101223000037.000|TR0|exclusive interview with us, the man who 
20101223000037.000|20101223000039.000|TR0|engineered the lame duck Democratic game, 
20101223000039.000|20101223000042.000|TR0|the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, 
20101223000042.000|20101223000044.000|TR0|chooses diplomacy over gloating.

20101223000050.000|20101223000053.000|TR0|SENATOR HARRY REID, (D) MAJORITY LEADER:  
20101223000053.000|20101223000055.000|TR0|Let's not talk about Harry Reid eating 
20101223000055.000|20101223000057.000|TR0|their lunch, but what we were able to do 
20101223000057.000|20101223000059.000|TR0|together, very, very good things for our 
20101223000059.000|20101223000101.000|TR0|country.

20101223000108.000|20101223000110.000|TR0|KING:  More of that conversation in just a 
20101223000110.000|20101223000112.000|TR0|moment.  Also with the stroke of a pen 
20101223000112.000|20101223000115.000|TR0|today, the president made history.

20101223000123.000|20101223000126.000|TR0|STATES OF AMERICA:  We are not a nation 
20101223000126.000|20101223000128.000|TR0|that says don't ask, don't tell.  We are a 
20101223000128.000|20101223000130.000|TR0|nation that says out of many, we are one.

20101223000137.000|20101223000139.000|TR0|KING:  Is this big shift just related to 
20101223000139.000|20101223000141.000|TR0|gays in the military or is the next 
20101223000141.000|20101223000143.000|TR0|battleground same-sex marriage?  That

20101223000148.000|20101223000150.000|TR0|The president also worked on a year-end 
20101223000150.000|20101223000152.000|TR0|press conference before heading off to 
20101223000152.000|20101223000154.000|TR0|Hawaii tonight.  Part victory lap after 
20101223000154.000|20101223000156.000|TR0|two very good weeks, part tone setter for 
20101223000156.000|20101223000159.000|TR0|next year when more Republican power will 
20101223000159.000|20101223000201.000|TR0|make his life a lot more complicated.

20101223000207.000|20101223000210.000|TR0|PRESIDENT OBAMA:  If there's any lesson to 
20101223000210.000|20101223000212.000|TR0|draw from these past few weeks, it's that 
20101223000212.000|20101223000214.000|TR0|we are not doomed to endless gridlock.  
20101223000214.000|20101223000216.000|TR0|We've shown in the wake of the November 
20101223000216.000|20101223000218.000|TR0|elections that we have the capacity not 
20101223000218.000|20101223000221.000|TR0|only to make progress but to make progress

20101223000225.000|20101223000227.000|TR0|KING:  Really?  Really?  Well, 
20101223000227.000|20101223000229.000|TR0|bipartisanship carry over to a new year 
20101223000229.000|20101223000232.000|TR0|that includes a new Republican speaker of 
20101223000232.000|20101223000234.000|TR0|the house and tough debates about spending 
20101223000234.000|20101223000236.000|TR0|and deficits?  Plenty to discuss and 
20101223000236.000|20101223000238.000|TR0|debate with our CNN contributors James 
20101223000238.000|20101223000240.000|TR0|Carville, Ed Rollins and John Avlon and 
20101223000240.000|20101223000243.000|TR0|with me here in Washington, Gloria Borger 
20101223000243.000|20101223000245.000|TR0|and Dana Bash.
20101223000245.000|20101223000247.000|TR0|
20101223000247.000|20101223000249.000|TR0|Ed, I want to start with you first because 
20101223000249.000|20101223000251.000|TR0|right after the election, everybody was 
20101223000251.000|20101223000254.000|TR0|saying, wow, 63 seats in the House, 
20101223000254.000|20101223000256.000|TR0|Republican games in the Senate, lame duck 
20101223000256.000|20101223000258.000|TR0|session would be dead.
20101223000258.000|20101223000300.000|TR0|
20101223000300.000|20101223000302.000|TR0|They would come in, the Democrats would 
20101223000302.000|20101223000304.000|TR0|have their tails between their legs and 
20101223000304.000|20101223000307.000|TR0|they'd pass the resolution to keep the 
20101223000307.000|20101223000309.000|TR0|government fund and go home.  Are you 
20101223000309.000|20101223000311.000|TR0|surprised?
20101223000311.000|20101223000313.000|TR0|
20101223000313.000|20101223000315.000|TR0|ED ROLLINS, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  
20101223000315.000|20101223000318.000|TR0|Let me say, these are very effective jobs. 
20101223000318.000|20101223000320.000|TR0| This is the last hoorah.  Obviously, the 
20101223000320.000|20101223000322.000|TR0|63 new Republicans aren't there until 
20101223000322.000|20101223000324.000|TR0|after January.  Harry Reid still had 59 
20101223000324.000|20101223000326.000|TR0|Democrats in the Senate, but I give them 
20101223000326.000|20101223000329.000|TR0|full credit for getting what they 
20101223000329.000|20101223000331.000|TR0|accomplished in the spirit of the 
20101223000331.000|20101223000333.000|TR0|holidays.  This is their high point and 
20101223000333.000|20101223000335.000|TR0|they'll look back on it for many, many 
20101223000335.000|20101223000337.000|TR0|years as their high point.
20101223000337.000|20101223000340.000|TR0|
20101223000340.000|20101223000342.000|TR0|KING:  What a nice holiday spirit from Ed 
20101223000342.000|20101223000344.000|TR0|Rollins.  Let's see if we can get it to - 
20101223000344.000|20101223000346.000|TR0|let's listen to the president's assessment 
20101223000346.000|20101223000348.000|TR0|real quick.  Because when he was talking 
20101223000348.000|20101223000351.000|TR0|today, yes, he was celebrating some pretty 
20101223000351.000|20101223000353.000|TR0|big victories in the last two weeks, but 
20101223000353.000|20101223000355.000|TR0|he also broadened it out.  He makes the 
20101223000355.000|20101223000357.000|TR0|case, if we listen here, he's had a pretty 
20101223000357.000|20101223000359.000|TR0|good two years.

20101223000406.000|20101223000408.000|TR0|PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I think it's fair to say 
20101223000408.000|20101223000410.000|TR0|this has been the most productive 
20101223000410.000|20101223000413.000|TR0|post-election period we've had in decades 
20101223000413.000|20101223000415.000|TR0|and it comes on the heels of the most 
20101223000415.000|20101223000417.000|TR0|productive two years that we've had in 
20101223000417.000|20101223000419.000|TR0|generations.  That doesn't mean that our 
20101223000419.000|20101223000421.000|TR0|business is finished.

20101223000430.000|20101223000432.000|TR0|finished part a little bit ahead, but 
20101223000432.000|20101223000435.000|TR0|let's focus on the here and now.  John 
20101223000435.000|20101223000437.000|TR0|Avlon, can the president, as he's trying 
20101223000437.000|20101223000439.000|TR0|to rebuild his public standing and he has 
20101223000439.000|20101223000441.000|TR0|had a couple of good weeks, is he in 
20101223000441.000|20101223000443.000|TR0|dangerous water when he starts talking 
20101223000443.000|20101223000446.000|TR0|about before the last two weeks that we've 
20101223000446.000|20101223000448.000|TR0|had pretty good or two years or is that an 
20101223000448.000|20101223000450.000|TR0|important case he has to make?
20101223000450.000|20101223000452.000|TR0|
20101223000452.000|20101223000454.000|TR0|JOHN AVLON, SENIOR POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR, 
20101223000454.000|20101223000457.000|TR0|DAILYBEAST.COM:  Well, I think that 
20101223000457.000|20101223000459.000|TR0|strains credibility a bit when he tries to 
20101223000459.000|20101223000501.000|TR0|build that bridge, but nobody can argue 
20101223000501.000|20101223000503.000|TR0|the last two weeks haven't been successful.
20101223000503.000|20101223000505.000|TR0|
20101223000505.000|20101223000508.000|TR0|And I think in the sense that we've seen 
20101223000508.000|20101223000510.000|TR0|more bipartisan agreement in the last two 
20101223000510.000|20101223000512.000|TR0|weeks than we have seen in the last two 
20101223000512.000|20101223000514.000|TR0|years.  That's an important part of the 
20101223000514.000|20101223000516.000|TR0|secret of his success going forward.     
20101223000516.000|20101223000519.000|TR0|If he draws lessons correctly and he's 
20101223000519.000|20101223000521.000|TR0|been making that case.  It was the eight 
20101223000521.000|20101223000523.000|TR0|Republicans who made "Don't Ask, Don't 
20101223000523.000|20101223000525.000|TR0|Tell," ending it possible.  It was 13 
20101223000525.000|20101223000527.000|TR0|Republicans who made ending -- endorsing 
20101223000527.000|20101223000530.000|TR0|the START Treaty possible.
20101223000530.000|20101223000532.000|TR0|
20101223000532.000|20101223000534.000|TR0|That's a record he's got to build on going 
20101223000534.000|20101223000536.000|TR0|forward and trying to re-characterize the 
20101223000536.000|20101223000538.000|TR0|Pelosi/Reid era, probably not going to do 
20101223000538.000|20101223000541.000|TR0|him any favors, but he's got a lot to 
20101223000541.000|20101223000543.000|TR0|build on in this last two weeks.
20101223000543.000|20101223000545.000|TR0|
20101223000545.000|20101223000547.000|TR0|KING:  James, you have been among the 
20101223000547.000|20101223000549.000|TR0|Democrats critical of how this president 
20101223000549.000|20101223000551.000|TR0|communicates sometimes.  I want your 
20101223000551.000|20101223000554.000|TR0|assessment today because I was sitting 
20101223000554.000|20101223000556.000|TR0|here with your old partner Paul Begala and 
20101223000556.000|20101223000558.000|TR0|we were listening to the president during 
20101223000558.000|20101223000600.000|TR0|the news conference.
20101223000600.000|20101223000602.000|TR0|
20101223000602.000|20101223000605.000|TR0|And he was talking directly to middle 
20101223000605.000|20101223000607.000|TR0|class families, talking about letters he 
20101223000607.000|20101223000609.000|TR0|gets from illegal immigrants, the children 
20101223000609.000|20101223000611.000|TR0|who would be affected by one piece of that 
20101223000611.000|20101223000613.000|TR0|unfinished dream act.  He seemed to be 
20101223000613.000|20101223000616.000|TR0|trying to connect more in his 
20101223000616.000|20101223000618.000|TR0|conversational tone today, do you agree?
20101223000618.000|20101223000620.000|TR0|
20101223000620.000|20101223000622.000|TR0|JAMES CARVILLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I 
20101223000622.000|20101223000624.000|TR0|do agree and look, history can say it's 
20101223000624.000|20101223000627.000|TR0|the most productive - the 111th most 
20101223000627.000|20101223000629.000|TR0|productive Congress we've had since the 
20101223000629.000|20101223000631.000|TR0|'30s, what they accomplished.  I don't 
20101223000631.000|20101223000633.000|TR0|know.  The market sure loved it.
20101223000633.000|20101223000635.000|TR0|
20101223000635.000|20101223000638.000|TR0|The S  was up 39 percent since the 111th 
20101223000638.000|20101223000640.000|TR0|began its term so somebody thought 
20101223000640.000|20101223000642.000|TR0|something was going OK during the course 
20101223000642.000|20101223000644.000|TR0|of this. The stock market lost Democrats.  
20101223000644.000|20101223000646.000|TR0|That's just a fact.
20101223000646.000|20101223000649.000|TR0|
20101223000649.000|20101223000651.000|TR0|KING:  OK.  I think that's on your 
20101223000651.000|20101223000653.000|TR0|Christmas card this year, isn't it?
20101223000653.000|20101223000655.000|TR0|
20101223000655.000|20101223000657.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  It is.
20101223000657.000|20101223000700.000|TR0|
20101223000700.000|20101223000702.000|TR0|KING:  Let's go over the wall.  Let's put 
20101223000702.000|20101223000704.000|TR0|it to the test.  We'll take a look at what 
20101223000704.000|20101223000706.000|TR0|we call the presidential report card.  
20101223000706.000|20101223000708.000|TR0|This takes into account not just the last 
20101223000708.000|20101223000711.000|TR0|two weeks, but last two years.  Health 
20101223000711.000|20101223000713.000|TR0|care reform that was the presidential 
20101223000713.000|20101223000715.000|TR0|promise, the troop draw-down in Iraq, the 
20101223000715.000|20101223000717.000|TR0|surge in Afghanistan, the Credit Card Bill 
20101223000717.000|20101223000719.000|TR0|of Rights, expanding Pell grants, 
20101223000719.000|20101223000722.000|TR0|financial reform, repeal of "Don't Ask, 
20101223000722.000|20101223000724.000|TR0|Don't Tell," the Recovery Act, that's the 
20101223000724.000|20101223000726.000|TR0|stimulus, the new START Treaty, and $806 
20101223000726.000|20101223000728.000|TR0|billion tax package.
20101223000728.000|20101223000730.000|TR0|
20101223000730.000|20101223000733.000|TR0|That's both promise kept and promise 
20101223000733.000|20101223000735.000|TR0|broken when you think about the Bush tax 
20101223000735.000|20101223000737.000|TR0|cuts for the high-end people.  
20101223000737.000|20101223000739.000|TR0|Unemployment benefits extended, the Food 
20101223000739.000|20101223000741.000|TR0|Safety Bill, 9/11 responders, takes me a 
20101223000741.000|20101223000744.000|TR0|while because that's a long list.
20101223000744.000|20101223000746.000|TR0|
20101223000746.000|20101223000748.000|TR0|But the president can rightly say, boom, 
20101223000748.000|20101223000750.000|TR0|those are things passed in the last two 
20101223000750.000|20101223000752.000|TR0|years that were top priorities.  You come 
20101223000752.000|20101223000755.000|TR0|over here. This is both on him and the 
20101223000755.000|20101223000757.000|TR0|Congress.  They didn't pass a budget. 
20101223000757.000|20101223000759.000|TR0|That's really not the best way to run the 
20101223000759.000|20101223000801.000|TR0|country.  They don't really have a budget 
20101223000801.000|20101223000803.000|TR0|in place.
20101223000803.000|20101223000806.000|TR0|
20101223000806.000|20101223000808.000|TR0|The president promised to do an 
20101223000808.000|20101223000810.000|TR0|immigration reform.  He did not. Dream Act 
20101223000810.000|20101223000812.000|TR0|is a subset of that.  He did not close 
20101223000812.000|20101223000814.000|TR0|Guantanamo Bay.  He did not reduce 
20101223000814.000|20101223000817.000|TR0|earmarks to 1994 levels and he did not 
20101223000817.000|20101223000819.000|TR0|keep his campaign promise to allow 
20101223000819.000|20101223000821.000|TR0|prescription drug imports into country.
20101223000821.000|20101223000823.000|TR0|
20101223000823.000|20101223000825.000|TR0|So there are some things the president has 
20101223000825.000|20101223000828.000|TR0|failed to keep. Promises the president 
20101223000828.000|20101223000830.000|TR0|still to keep, but Dana Bash, this is your 
20101223000830.000|20101223000832.000|TR0|beat, when your walk these halls, the 
20101223000832.000|20101223000834.000|TR0|Democrats, they're sort of having mixed 
20101223000834.000|20101223000836.000|TR0|mood, because they have the sour feelings 
20101223000836.000|20101223000838.000|TR0|because they lost.
20101223000838.000|20101223000841.000|TR0|
20101223000841.000|20101223000843.000|TR0|Speaker Pelosi has to give up the gavel, 
20101223000843.000|20101223000845.000|TR0|but when they look at that, do they look 
20101223000845.000|20101223000847.000|TR0|at that -- now, they know they did that 
20101223000847.000|20101223000849.000|TR0|and lost so it's bittersweet but --
20101223000849.000|20101223000852.000|TR0|
20101223000852.000|20101223000854.000|TR0|DANA BASH, SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL 
20101223000854.000|20101223000856.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  I think they wish that 
20101223000856.000|20101223000858.000|TR0|they did more of the touting of the things 
20101223000858.000|20101223000900.000|TR0|on the pass list.  The problem the 
20101223000900.000|20101223000903.000|TR0|Democrats obviously faced in the election 
20101223000903.000|20101223000905.000|TR0|and we're going to see the fallout from 
20101223000905.000|20101223000907.000|TR0|that in next year, is that many of the 
20101223000907.000|20101223000909.000|TR0|things that they passed, American people 
20101223000909.000|20101223000911.000|TR0|didn't like or maybe didn't know enough 
20101223000911.000|20101223000914.000|TR0|about.  Who knows?
20101223000914.000|20101223000916.000|TR0|
20101223000916.000|20101223000918.000|TR0|But that is what drove the election.  I 
20101223000918.000|20101223000920.000|TR0|think what was most interesting to me in 
20101223000920.000|20101223000922.000|TR0|talking to senators in the hallway today 
20101223000922.000|20101223000925.000|TR0|is hearing from Republicans.  Lindsey 
20101223000925.000|20101223000927.000|TR0|Graham of South Carolina for example, he 
20101223000927.000|20101223000929.000|TR0|was talking about how angry he was that 
20101223000929.000|20101223000931.000|TR0|his fellow Republicans broke and gave 
20101223000931.000|20101223000933.000|TR0|Democrats these victory, saying, I don't 
20101223000933.000|20101223000936.000|TR0|understand why they don't realize things 
20101223000936.000|20101223000938.000|TR0|would be a lot easier for us, Republicans, 
20101223000938.000|20101223000940.000|TR0|when we have more seats and we can do 
20101223000940.000|20101223000942.000|TR0|things better.
20101223000942.000|20101223000944.000|TR0|
20101223000944.000|20101223000947.000|TR0|GLORIA BORGER, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  
20101223000947.000|20101223000949.000|TR0|Just wait.  I mean, they will have more 
20101223000949.000|20101223000951.000|TR0|seats and this was, you know, as Ed said, 
20101223000951.000|20101223000953.000|TR0|sort of the Democrats last hoorah.  I also 
20101223000953.000|20101223000955.000|TR0|think it was a response on both sides, 
20101223000955.000|20101223000958.000|TR0|Republican and Democrats, to the last 
20101223000958.000|20101223001000.000|TR0|election where voters said, you have to 
20101223001000.000|20101223001002.000|TR0|get something done.
20101223001002.000|20101223001004.000|TR0|
20101223001004.000|20101223001006.000|TR0|And the things that they passed were 
20101223001006.000|20101223001009.000|TR0|actually things that a lot of voters 
20101223001009.000|20101223001011.000|TR0|wanted and liked.  You know, this tax cut 
20101223001011.000|20101223001013.000|TR0|package, as you know, was quite popular 
20101223001013.000|20101223001015.000|TR0|with voters because why not?  Everybody 
20101223001015.000|20101223001017.000|TR0|gets something out of it, right?
20101223001017.000|20101223001020.000|TR0|
20101223001020.000|20101223001022.000|TR0|BASH:  Right.
20101223001022.000|20101223001024.000|TR0|
20101223001024.000|20101223001026.000|TR0|KING:  It's an important point, because as 
20101223001026.000|20101223001028.000|TR0|we were saying today, that the president 
20101223001028.000|20101223001031.000|TR0|does deserve credit for some victories he 
20101223001031.000|20101223001033.000|TR0|wanted. Start treaty is a big deal to the 
20101223001033.000|20101223001035.000|TR0|president of the United States. "Don't 
20101223001035.000|20101223001037.000|TR0|Ask, Don't Tell," is a big deal to the 
20101223001037.000|20101223001039.000|TR0|president of the United States.
20101223001039.000|20101223001042.000|TR0|
20101223001042.000|20101223001044.000|TR0|You know, a lot of liberals are mad at him 
20101223001044.000|20101223001046.000|TR0|on that tax deal -- I was getting e-mails 
20101223001046.000|20101223001048.000|TR0|from Republicans saying, don't forget, we 
20101223001048.000|20101223001050.000|TR0|did OK in this session too.  They denied 
20101223001050.000|20101223001053.000|TR0|the omnibus spending bill, which had all 
20101223001053.000|20101223001055.000|TR0|those earmarks and they pulled those 
20101223001055.000|20101223001057.000|TR0|earmarks out and they just passed a 
20101223001057.000|20101223001059.000|TR0|continuing resolution.  We'll have a 
20101223001059.000|20101223001101.000|TR0|budget in March.
20101223001101.000|20101223001104.000|TR0|
20101223001104.000|20101223001106.000|TR0|The Republicans got this Democratic 
20101223001106.000|20101223001108.000|TR0|president who campaigned on a promise to 
20101223001108.000|20101223001110.000|TR0|get rid of the Bush tax cuts for the rich 
20101223001110.000|20101223001112.000|TR0|to extend them another two years.  They 
20101223001112.000|20101223001115.000|TR0|also cut the size, John Avlon, of that 
20101223001115.000|20101223001117.000|TR0|9/11 responders bill -- there was a large 
20101223001117.000|20101223001119.000|TR0|of outrage they wouldn't pass it, but in 
20101223001119.000|20101223001121.000|TR0|the end the Republicans cut the price tag 
20101223001121.000|20101223001123.000|TR0|down from $7.5 billion to somewhere in the 
20101223001123.000|20101223001125.000|TR0|ball park of $4 billion.  So they think 
20101223001125.000|20101223001128.000|TR0|that's good conservative governance.
20101223001128.000|20101223001130.000|TR0|
20101223001130.000|20101223001132.000|TR0|AVLON:  That's right, and it's a good 
20101223001132.000|20101223001134.000|TR0|indication of how this lame duck has been 
20101223001134.000|20101223001136.000|TR0|productive because it's been characterized 
20101223001136.000|20101223001139.000|TR0|by principled compromise and Gloria is 
20101223001139.000|20101223001141.000|TR0|right.  It represents the message I think 
20101223001141.000|20101223001143.000|TR0|the voters were sending, which has to do 
20101223001143.000|20101223001145.000|TR0|with checks and balances, the virtues of 
20101223001145.000|20101223001147.000|TR0|divided government.
20101223001147.000|20101223001150.000|TR0|
20101223001150.000|20101223001152.000|TR0|It shows us going forward that divided 
20101223001152.000|20101223001154.000|TR0|government does not mean -- need to mean 
20101223001154.000|20101223001156.000|TR0|gridlock.  If you look forward to some of 
20101223001156.000|20101223001158.000|TR0|those undone issues like immigration 
20101223001158.000|20101223001201.000|TR0|reform or rolling back earmarks, there's 
20101223001201.000|20101223001203.000|TR0|-- I have every confidence those can be 
20101223001203.000|20101223001205.000|TR0|accomplished in the next two years if this 
20101223001205.000|20101223001207.000|TR0|model is followed forward.
20101223001207.000|20101223001209.000|TR0|
20101223001209.000|20101223001212.000|TR0|KING:  James, I want you to listen here to 
20101223001212.000|20101223001214.000|TR0|Senator Jim DeMint because to the point 
20101223001214.000|20101223001216.000|TR0|Dana was just making.  She talked to 
20101223001216.000|20101223001218.000|TR0|Lindsey Graham about this.  There are a 
20101223001218.000|20101223001220.000|TR0|lot of conservatives saying, wait a minute.
20101223001220.000|20101223001223.000|TR0|
20101223001223.000|20101223001225.000|TR0|Let's just block anything because when we 
20101223001225.000|20101223001227.000|TR0|come back in January we'll be more 
20101223001227.000|20101223001229.000|TR0|powerful and even if we get a good deal 
20101223001229.000|20101223001231.000|TR0|today, we'll be able to get a better deal 
20101223001231.000|20101223001234.000|TR0|in January.  Listen to Jim DeMint's 
20101223001234.000|20101223001236.000|TR0|frustration.

20101223001242.000|20101223001245.000|TR0|SENATOR JIM DEMINT (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  So 
20101223001245.000|20101223001247.000|TR0|much is being pushed through because of 
20101223001247.000|20101223001249.000|TR0|the fear here that if we actually let the 
20101223001249.000|20101223001251.000|TR0|newly elected congressmen and senators be 
20101223001251.000|20101223001253.000|TR0|sworn in before we take up these important 
20101223001253.000|20101223001256.000|TR0|issues that they will actually reflect the 
20101223001256.000|20101223001258.000|TR0|opinions of the American people and stop 
20101223001258.000|20101223001300.000|TR0|what we're doing.

20101223001309.000|20101223001311.000|TR0|this could have been done without some 
20101223001311.000|20101223001313.000|TR0|Republican votes, three on this issue, 
20101223001313.000|20101223001315.000|TR0|eight on this issue, 15 on another an

20101223001322.000|20101223001324.000|TR0|town.  There's no doubt about it, Senator 
20101223001324.000|20101223001326.000|TR0|DeMint and his people are going to have an 
20101223001326.000|20101223001329.000|TR0|interesting thing.  Also, the Republican 
20101223001329.000|20101223001331.000|TR0|presidential race's gearing up.
20101223001331.000|20101223001333.000|TR0|
20101223001333.000|20101223001335.000|TR0|My friend Governor Barber of Mississippi 
20101223001335.000|20101223001337.000|TR0|is already weighing in with some comments 
20101223001337.000|20101223001340.000|TR0|here so in some ways as a Democrat, I'm 
20101223001340.000|20101223001342.000|TR0|looking for a lot of these people to voice 
20101223001342.000|20101223001344.000|TR0|their opinions.  Let's hear what they got 
20101223001344.000|20101223001346.000|TR0|to say out there.  There's more coming.  
20101223001346.000|20101223001348.000|TR0|Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich.  Let's bring 
20101223001348.000|20101223001351.000|TR0|the whole thing on.
20101223001351.000|20101223001353.000|TR0|
20101223001353.000|20101223001355.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  The interesting thing is 
20101223001355.000|20101223001357.000|TR0|everything that you list there as success, 
20101223001357.000|20101223001359.000|TR0|which obviously to the president these are 
20101223001359.000|20101223001402.000|TR0|things he had promised in the campaign, 
20101223001402.000|20101223001404.000|TR0|that's what we're going to debate again in 
20101223001404.000|20101223001406.000|TR0|the presidential year.
20101223001406.000|20101223001408.000|TR0|
20101223001408.000|20101223001410.000|TR0|Republicans are obviously going to try to 
20101223001410.000|20101223001413.000|TR0|make the case.  I mean, it's not going to 
20101223001413.000|20101223001415.000|TR0|be the START Treaty.  No one's going to 
20101223001415.000|20101223001417.000|TR0|care about that in a year or two, but 
20101223001417.000|20101223001419.000|TR0|these other issue, certainly some of that 
20101223001419.000|20101223001421.000|TR0|is going to be in the forefront.  But the 
20101223001421.000|20101223001423.000|TR0|most important numbers not the stock 
20101223001423.000|20101223001426.000|TR0|market.  It goes up and down, and I'm not 
20101223001426.000|20101223001428.000|TR0|a rich guy so it doesn't make a difference 
20101223001428.000|20101223001430.000|TR0|to me.
20101223001430.000|20101223001432.000|TR0|
20101223001432.000|20101223001434.000|TR0|But what does matter is 9.8 percent 
20101223001434.000|20101223001437.000|TR0|unemployment and if that number does not 
20101223001437.000|20101223001439.000|TR0|come down substantially then it's going to 
20101223001439.000|20101223001441.000|TR0|be a very close election.  We'll all 
20101223001441.000|20101223001443.000|TR0|concede that. Everything forward is going 
20101223001443.000|20101223001445.000|TR0|to be about getting this economy moving.

20101223001448.000|20101223001450.000|TR0|KING:  On that point, let's take a quick 
20101223001450.000|20101223001452.000|TR0|time-out.  When we come back that's just 
20101223001452.000|20101223001454.000|TR0|what we'll do, look forward.  What lessons 
20101223001454.000|20101223001456.000|TR0|have we learned since the election, in the 
20101223001456.000|20101223001459.000|TR0|last two weeks?  What will it mean when a 
20101223001459.000|20101223001501.000|TR0|very new Congress and a very new 
20101223001501.000|20101223001503.000|TR0|Washington comes back to work in January?

20101223001510.000|20101223001512.000|TR0|KING:  If we've learned anything in the 
20101223001512.000|20101223001514.000|TR0|last several weeks, it is that American 
20101223001514.000|20101223001516.000|TR0|politics at the moment are more than a 
20101223001516.000|20101223001518.000|TR0|little volatile. The Republicans win big 
20101223001518.000|20101223001521.000|TR0|in November.  The president called it a 
20101223001521.000|20101223001523.000|TR0|shellacking then.  You might say he's had 
20101223001523.000|20101223001525.000|TR0|a December to remember.

20101223001532.000|20101223001534.000|TR0|Borger, Dana Bash here.  Let's listen to 
20101223001534.000|20101223001536.000|TR0|the president today because at this news 
20101223001536.000|20101223001538.000|TR0|conference he wasn't trying to glow.  He 
20101223001538.000|20101223001540.000|TR0|was taking a bit of a victory lap, but he 
20101223001540.000|20101223001543.000|TR0|also when he comes back, this town is 
20101223001543.000|20101223001545.000|TR0|going to be fascinating because the big 
20101223001545.000|20101223001547.000|TR0|issue is going to be spending, deficit 
20101223001547.000|20101223001549.000|TR0|reduction.

20101223001551.000|20101223001554.000|TR0|How do you do those things without 
20101223001554.000|20101223001556.000|TR0|knocking the economy off its sort of 
20101223001556.000|20101223001558.000|TR0|anemic path of growth at the moment?  So 
20101223001558.000|20101223001600.000|TR0|the president says we're going to have 
20101223001600.000|20101223001602.000|TR0|some differences and I'm going to make my

20101223001613.000|20101223001616.000|TR0|to answer an increasingly urgent question. 
20101223001616.000|20101223001618.000|TR0| And that is, how do we cut spending that 
20101223001618.000|20101223001620.000|TR0|we don't need while still making 
20101223001620.000|20101223001622.000|TR0|investments we do need? Investments in

20101223001624.000|20101223001627.000|TR0|innovation and the things that are

20101223001629.000|20101223001631.000|TR0|long run, create jobs and compete with 
20101223001631.000|20101223001633.000|TR0|every other nation in the world?  I look 
20101223001633.000|20101223001635.000|TR0|forward to hearing from folks on both

20101223001646.000|20101223001649.000|TR0|that case?  When he's under all the

20101223001655.000|20101223001657.000|TR0|still have to build roads and bridge.  We 
20101223001657.000|20101223001700.000|TR0|still have to give colleges this research 
20101223001700.000|20101223001702.000|TR0|and development money.  We still have to 
20101223001702.000|20101223001704.000|TR0|maybe build some high speed rail.  Can the 
20101223001704.000|20101223001706.000|TR0|president make that case?
20101223001706.000|20101223001708.000|TR0|
20101223001708.000|20101223001710.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  First of all, there will be 
20101223001710.000|20101223001713.000|TR0|other people making the case with him and 
20101223001713.000|20101223001715.000|TR0|for him.  Secondly, we're going to -- I'm 
20101223001715.000|20101223001717.000|TR0|waiting to see -- so far they've cut 
20101223001717.000|20101223001719.000|TR0|National Public Radio or something like 
20101223001719.000|20101223001721.000|TR0|that.  Added $700 billion to the deficit 
20101223001721.000|20101223001724.000|TR0|by tax cuts to the rich.     So I don't 
20101223001724.000|20101223001726.000|TR0|know, but I'm very anxious to see the 
20101223001726.000|20101223001728.000|TR0|proposals by the new Republicans coming to 
20101223001728.000|20101223001730.000|TR0|town.  The Tea Party people and Senator 
20101223001730.000|20101223001732.000|TR0|DeMint, they're talking about shutting the 
20101223001732.000|20101223001735.000|TR0|government down.  Let's see if that 
20101223001735.000|20101223001737.000|TR0|happens.  We'll just have to wait and see.
20101223001737.000|20101223001739.000|TR0|
20101223001739.000|20101223001741.000|TR0|BORGER:  I think what --
20101223001741.000|20101223001743.000|TR0|
20101223001743.000|20101223001746.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  James, challenge you on that.  
20101223001746.000|20101223001748.000|TR0|No one has said that, James.  You have 
20101223001748.000|20101223001750.000|TR0|said it.
20101223001750.000|20101223001752.000|TR0|
20101223001752.000|20101223001754.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20101223001754.000|20101223001757.000|TR0|
20101223001757.000|20101223001759.000|TR0|BORGER:  I think what we saw from Barack 
20101223001759.000|20101223001801.000|TR0|Obama today -- was he laid down the 
20101223001801.000|20101223001803.000|TR0|marker.  He told them exactly --
20101223001803.000|20101223001805.000|TR0|
20101223001805.000|20101223001808.000|TR0|KING:  But can he keep it?
20101223001808.000|20101223001810.000|TR0|
20101223001810.000|20101223001812.000|TR0|BORGER:  Well, but it depends how 
20101223001812.000|20101223001814.000|TR0|vulnerable and how -- that majority is of 
20101223001814.000|20101223001816.000|TR0|Republicans, i.e., how do they behave?  
20101223001816.000|20101223001819.000|TR0|And do they seem responsible or do they 
20101223001819.000|20101223001821.000|TR0|come in and say, we just want to cut 
20101223001821.000|20101223001823.000|TR0|everything or not?
20101223001823.000|20101223001825.000|TR0|
20101223001825.000|20101223001827.000|TR0|KING:  And Ed is right when he says nobody 
20101223001827.000|20101223001830.000|TR0|in an elected position of responsibility 
20101223001830.000|20101223001832.000|TR0|is talking about shutting down the 
20101223001832.000|20101223001834.000|TR0|government. However --
20101223001834.000|20101223001836.000|TR0|
20101223001836.000|20101223001838.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  Shut it down --
20101223001838.000|20101223001841.000|TR0|
20101223001841.000|20101223001843.000|TR0|KING:  However, they passed a temporary 
20101223001843.000|20101223001845.000|TR0|resolution that gets them only to march, 
20101223001845.000|20101223001847.000|TR0|Ed Rollins and this is where I think what 
20101223001847.000|20101223001849.000|TR0|they changed me and then they have to vote 
20101223001849.000|20101223001852.000|TR0|to maybe lift the debt ceiling then they 
20101223001852.000|20101223001854.000|TR0|have to make additional decisions.  So in 
20101223001854.000|20101223001856.000|TR0|effect, they've set themselves up for that 
20101223001856.000|20101223001858.000|TR0|possibility.  Is it a real prospect?
20101223001858.000|20101223001900.000|TR0|
20101223001900.000|20101223001903.000|TR0|BASH:  Shutting down the government?
20101223001903.000|20101223001905.000|TR0|
20101223001905.000|20101223001907.000|TR0|KING:  Yes.
20101223001907.000|20101223001909.000|TR0|
20101223001909.000|20101223001911.000|TR0|BAHS:  I mean, if you talk to the 
20101223001911.000|20101223001914.000|TR0|Republican leader, the answer is no and 
20101223001914.000|20101223001916.000|TR0|they are the ones who are going to be in 
20101223001916.000|20101223001918.000|TR0|the room negotiating.  Are there people 
20101223001918.000|20101223001920.000|TR0|who have come in and are there people who 
20101223001920.000|20101223001922.000|TR0|kind of in the back benchers who say they 
20101223001922.000|20101223001925.000|TR0|might want to do that? Absolutely, but I 
20101223001925.000|20101223001927.000|TR0|just don't see that happening right now.
20101223001927.000|20101223001929.000|TR0|
20101223001929.000|20101223001931.000|TR0|But I think what has been interesting, in 
20101223001931.000|20101223001933.000|TR0|talking to Republicans about the way this 
20101223001933.000|20101223001936.000|TR0|lame duck session has been, is that they 
20101223001936.000|20101223001938.000|TR0|are -- some of them who actually may want 
20101223001938.000|20101223001940.000|TR0|to get some things done, they tell me they 
20101223001940.000|20101223001942.000|TR0|are concerned that by having these Obama 
20101223001942.000|20101223001944.000|TR0|victories.
20101223001944.000|20101223001947.000|TR0|
20101223001947.000|20101223001949.000|TR0|It is going to inflame the base even more 
20101223001949.000|20101223001951.000|TR0|than they already were beforehand and push 
20101223001951.000|20101223001953.000|TR0|the people they elected to be even more 
20101223001953.000|20101223001955.000|TR0|against compromise than they were before.
20101223001955.000|20101223001957.000|TR0|
20101223001957.000|20101223002000.000|TR0|KING:  And so, Ed, how does Mitch 
20101223002000.000|20101223002002.000|TR0|McConnell and John Boehner, two guys who 
20101223002002.000|20101223002004.000|TR0|are conservatives, but they are 
20101223002004.000|20101223002006.000|TR0|legislators.  How do they deal with that 
20101223002006.000|20101223002008.000|TR0|when the Tea Party guys come in January 
20101223002008.000|20101223002011.000|TR0|and say you gave away too much in 
20101223002011.000|20101223002013.000|TR0|December, stop, stop, stop?
20101223002013.000|20101223002015.000|TR0|
20101223002015.000|20101223002017.000|TR0|ROLLINS:  Well, first of all, it's a 
20101223002017.000|20101223002019.000|TR0|matter of priorities.  The president laid 
20101223002019.000|20101223002022.000|TR0|out his priorities.  He wants to spend a 
20101223002022.000|20101223002024.000|TR0|lot of money on education and what have 
20101223002024.000|20101223002026.000|TR0|you.  That will be part of the debate and 
20101223002026.000|20101223002028.000|TR0|I think to a certain extent, the budget is 
20101223002028.000|20101223002030.000|TR0|the document.
20101223002030.000|20101223002033.000|TR0|
20101223002033.000|20101223002035.000|TR0|By letting this go to march, let's us draw 
20101223002035.000|20101223002037.000|TR0|the document.  Put the draft down 
20101223002037.000|20101223002039.000|TR0|everybody that says we don't have.  Let's 
20101223002039.000|20101223002041.000|TR0|see if we have and that's how you set 
20101223002041.000|20101223002044.000|TR0|priorities.  You're going to have to 
20101223002044.000|20101223002046.000|TR0|basically reduce spending and you're going 
20101223002046.000|20101223002048.000|TR0|to have raise revenue eventually before 
20101223002048.000|20101223002050.000|TR0|you're even going to resolve this thing.
20101223002050.000|20101223002052.000|TR0|
20101223002052.000|20101223002055.000|TR0|AVLON:  Ed's right.  Take the big step 
20101223002055.000|20101223002057.000|TR0|back.  This is about the deficit and the 
20101223002057.000|20101223002059.000|TR0|debt, which is allegedly the number one 
20101223002059.000|20101223002101.000|TR0|concern of the Tea Party.  It's not of 
20101223002101.000|20101223002103.000|TR0|necessarily about shutting down the 
20101223002103.000|20101223002106.000|TR0|government.  I think Republicans remember 
20101223002106.000|20101223002108.000|TR0|that didn't work out too well --
20101223002108.000|20101223002110.000|TR0|
20101223002110.000|20101223002112.000|TR0|BORGER:  John, but the Republicans I talk 
20101223002112.000|20101223002114.000|TR0|to say what they're going to do when it 
20101223002114.000|20101223002117.000|TR0|comes - time to raise the debt ceiling and 
20101223002117.000|20101223002119.000|TR0|Dana, you know about this, is they're 
20101223002119.000|20101223002121.000|TR0|going to propose cuts at the same time.  
20101223002121.000|20101223002123.000|TR0|You talk about raising the debt and give 
20101223002123.000|20101223002125.000|TR0|$100 billion in cut, right?
20101223002125.000|20101223002128.000|TR0|
20101223002128.000|20101223002130.000|TR0|AVLON:  You make some condition.  Here's 
20101223002130.000|20101223002132.000|TR0|an opportunity for the president to lead.  
20101223002132.000|20101223002134.000|TR0|He talks about deficit and debt reduction. 
20101223002134.000|20101223002136.000|TR0| Before the inauguration, he talked about 
20101223002136.000|20101223002139.000|TR0|the importance of entitlement reform.
20101223002139.000|20101223002141.000|TR0|
20101223002141.000|20101223002143.000|TR0|So you talk about him being the adult in 
20101223002143.000|20101223002145.000|TR0|the room.  He's going to have to lead this 
20101223002145.000|20101223002147.000|TR0|conversation, but he can do that.  He can 
20101223002147.000|20101223002150.000|TR0|raise revenues with tax reform in ways 
20101223002150.000|20101223002152.000|TR0|that don't raise taxes outright, but close 
20101223002152.000|20101223002154.000|TR0|loopholes.
20101223002154.000|20101223002156.000|TR0|
20101223002156.000|20101223002158.000|TR0|That's the kind of negotiation you're 
20101223002158.000|20101223002201.000|TR0|going to see.  That will be very effective 
20101223002201.000|20101223002203.000|TR0|for him in terms of reconnecting with 
20101223002203.000|20101223002205.000|TR0|centrist and independent voters continuing 
20101223002205.000|20101223002207.000|TR0|from --
20101223002207.000|20101223002209.000|TR0|
20101223002209.000|20101223002212.000|TR0|KING:  James, what does it tell you about 
20101223002212.000|20101223002214.000|TR0|public opinion?  What does it tell you 
20101223002214.000|20101223002216.000|TR0|when you look at our new polling right 
20101223002216.000|20101223002218.000|TR0|now?  The president got his butt kicked 
20101223002218.000|20101223002220.000|TR0|last month and yet is Obama doing enough 
20101223002220.000|20101223002223.000|TR0|to cooperate with Republicans?
20101223002223.000|20101223002225.000|TR0|
20101223002225.000|20101223002227.000|TR0|The American people, 59 percent say yes, 
20101223002227.000|20101223002229.000|TR0|37 percent say no so the president getting 
20101223002229.000|20101223002231.000|TR0|credit there for cooperating with 
20101223002231.000|20101223002234.000|TR0|Republicans.  Are Republicans doing enough 
20101223002234.000|20101223002236.000|TR0|to cooperate with Obama, 28 percent yes, 7 
20101223002236.000|20101223002238.000|TR0|in 10 Americans say no.  They just won an 
20101223002238.000|20101223002240.000|TR0|election and the American people are 
20101223002240.000|20101223002242.000|TR0|saying never mind.
20101223002242.000|20101223002244.000|TR0|
20101223002244.000|20101223002247.000|TR0|CARVILLE:  Well, of course, they're 
20101223002247.000|20101223002249.000|TR0|against the 9/11 responders till Jon 
20101223002249.000|20101223002251.000|TR0|Stewart made them be for it.  I'm on a 
20101223002251.000|20101223002253.000|TR0|different planet than other people.  Thank 
20101223002253.000|20101223002255.000|TR0|you, Dana Bash.

20101223002258.000|20101223002300.000|TR0|You have Republican members of Congress 
20101223002300.000|20101223002302.000|TR0|talking about shutting the government 
20101223002302.000|20101223002304.000|TR0|down.  The Republican Party shut the 
20101223002304.000|20101223002306.000|TR0|government down in the '90s.  This is not 
20101223002306.000|20101223002309.000|TR0|some crazy Glenn Beck conspiracy thing, 
20101223002309.000|20101223002311.000|TR0|guys. This is real Congress I'm talking 
20101223002311.000|20101223002313.000|TR0|about.  This is something that your party 
20101223002313.000|20101223002315.000|TR0|has a history of doing and these people 
20101223002315.000|20101223002317.000|TR0|coming in, they --
20101223002317.000|20101223002320.000|TR0|
20101223002320.000|20101223002322.000|TR0|BORGER:  James, don't you think the 
20101223002322.000|20101223002324.000|TR0|leaders have learned?
20101223002324.000|20101223002326.000|TR0|
20101223002326.000|20101223002328.000|TR0|KING:  We're going to see if they learned. 
20101223002328.000|20101223002331.000|TR0| On that feisty note, I'm going to --
20101223002331.000|20101223002333.000|TR0|
20101223002333.000|20101223002335.000|TR0|CARVILLE: -- I know people are talking 
20101223002335.000|20101223002337.000|TR0|about it.
20101223002337.000|20101223002339.000|TR0|
20101223002339.000|20101223002342.000|TR0|KING:  We'll continue this conversation, 
20101223002342.000|20101223002344.000|TR0|but I need to call a time-out right now.  
20101223002344.000|20101223002346.000|TR0|A lot more come in the program.  The 
20101223002346.000|20101223002348.000|TR0|reason I'm calling a time-out is because 
20101223002348.000|20101223002350.000|TR0|we have so much packed in tonight.
20101223002350.000|20101223002353.000|TR0|
20101223002353.000|20101223002355.000|TR0|When we come back, we're going to go 
20101223002355.000|20101223002357.000|TR0|exclusively one on one with Harry Reid.  
20101223002357.000|20101223002359.000|TR0|He is the Democratic leader who just in 
20101223002359.000|20101223002401.000|TR0|the view of many Republicans snookered 
20101223002401.000|20101223002404.000|TR0|them.  We'll talk to him exclusively about 
20101223002404.000|20101223002406.000|TR0|the lame duck and some Republicans think 
20101223002406.000|20101223002408.000|TR0|he just ate their lunch.
20101223002408.000|20101223002410.000|TR0|
20101223002410.000|20101223002412.000|TR0|Also, I think an intelligent story to talk 
20101223002412.000|20101223002415.000|TR0|about tonight.  Is there a holiday threat 
20101223002415.000|20101223002417.000|TR0|and is the president's director of 
20101223002417.000|20101223002419.000|TR0|National Intelligence out of the loop.  
20101223002419.000|20101223002421.000|TR0|We'll talk to the chair of the Senate 
20101223002421.000|20101223002423.000|TR0|Intelligence Committee.  She'll tell us 
20101223002423.000|20101223002426.000|TR0|that one.
20101223002426.000|20101223002428.000|TR0|
20101223002428.000|20101223002430.000|TR0|And when we come back the president made 
20101223002430.000|20101223002432.000|TR0|history today by signing the repeal of 
20101223002432.000|20101223002434.000|TR0|"Don't Ask, Don't Tell."  He also talked 
20101223002434.000|20101223002437.000|TR0|about his views on same-sex marriage.  Gay 
20101223002437.000|20101223002439.000|TR0|right, is it still right issue?
20101223002439.000|20101223002441.000|TR0|

20101223002456.000|20101223002459.000|TR0|haven't filled up for your holiday trip.  
20101223002459.000|20101223002501.000|TR0|Triple A says the national average for 
20101223002501.000|20101223002503.000|TR0|gasoline is just about to hit $3 a gallon. 
20101223002503.000|20101223002505.000|TR0| The highest price at the pump since 
20101223002505.000|20101223002507.000|TR0|October 2008.
20101223002507.000|20101223002510.000|TR0|
20101223002510.000|20101223002512.000|TR0|A half dozen Southern California counties 
20101223002512.000|20101223002514.000|TR0|are under an emergency declaration as 
20101223002514.000|20101223002516.000|TR0|another powerful storm from the pacific is 
20101223002516.000|20101223002518.000|TR0|hitting the region.  But right now, there 
20101223002518.000|20101223002521.000|TR0|is a beautiful double rainbow over Los 
20101223002521.000|20101223002523.000|TR0|Angeles.  Live pictures right there.  
20101223002523.000|20101223002525.000|TR0|You're looking at it as it happens.

20101223002527.000|20101223002529.000|TR0|President Obama is on his way to join his 
20101223002529.000|20101223002532.000|TR0|family for a Christmas vacation in Hawaii. 
20101223002532.000|20101223002534.000|TR0| Air Force One took of just before the top

20101223002538.000|20101223002540.000|TR0|And in Alaska today, Joe Miller lost 
20101223002540.000|20101223002542.000|TR0|again.  The state Supreme Court ruled 
20101223002542.000|20101223002545.000|TR0|against every point of his challenge to 
20101223002545.000|20101223002547.000|TR0|Senator Lisa Murkowski's write-in victory. 
20101223002547.000|20101223002549.000|TR0| The court declared there are no remaining 
20101223002549.000|20101223002551.000|TR0|issues to prevent Murkowski's re-election 
20101223002551.000|20101223002553.000|TR0|from being certified.  A long fight over 
20101223002553.000|20101223002556.000|TR0|at last.
20101223002556.000|20101223002558.000|TR0|
20101223002558.000|20101223002600.000|TR0|KING:  A lot of Republicans had been 
20101223002600.000|20101223002602.000|TR0|urging him even Republicans who supported 
20101223002602.000|20101223002604.000|TR0|Joe Miller have been urging to give it up, 
20101223002604.000|20101223002607.000|TR0|give it up. On that note, Senator 
20101223002607.000|20101223002609.000|TR0|Murkowski will be right here with us 
20101223002609.000|20101223002611.000|TR0|tomorrow night to talk about her votes in 
20101223002611.000|20101223002613.000|TR0|the lame duck session of Congress.     
20101223002613.000|20101223002615.000|TR0|Since she won that race, she seems a 
20101223002615.000|20101223002618.000|TR0|little liberated.  Joe, it's been very 
20101223002618.000|20101223002620.000|TR0|interesting.
20101223002620.000|20101223002622.000|TR0|
20101223002622.000|20101223002624.000|TR0|JOHNS:  She certainly has.

20101223002629.000|20101223002631.000|TR0|Senator Murkowski, Republican of Alaska.  
20101223002631.000|20101223002633.000|TR0|When we come back, Democrat Harry Reid of 
20101223002633.000|20101223002635.000|TR0|Nevada.  He just won a tough re-election 
20101223002635.000|20101223002637.000|TR0|battle and then as the majority leader, he 
20101223002637.000|20101223002640.000|TR0|led the Democrats in the so-called 
20101223002640.000|20101223002642.000|TR0|lame-duck session.  He's with us 
20101223002642.000|20101223002644.000|TR0|exclusively in just a minute.

20101223002653.000|20101223002655.000|TR0|begrudgingly give a great deal of credit 
20101223002655.000|20101223002657.000|TR0|for all of the advancements in the 
20101223002657.000|20101223002659.000|TR0|lame-duck session of Congress, the Senate 
20101223002659.000|20101223002702.000|TR0|Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of 
20101223002702.000|20101223002704.000|TR0|Nevada joins us now from his office on 
20101223002704.000|20101223002706.000|TR0|Capitol Hill.
20101223002706.000|20101223002708.000|TR0|
20101223002708.000|20101223002710.000|TR0|Senator, I want to get to some of the 
20101223002710.000|20101223002713.000|TR0|specifics, but I want to start with what 
20101223002713.000|20101223002715.000|TR0|might be the ultimate irony.  This was the 
20101223002715.000|20101223002717.000|TR0|lame-duck session and in this campaign 
20101223002717.000|20101223002719.000|TR0|year, Republicans had hoped to make you 
20101223002719.000|20101223002721.000|TR0|target number one.
20101223002721.000|20101223002724.000|TR0|
20101223002724.000|20101223002726.000|TR0|Lame duck number one if you will.  They 
20101223002726.000|20101223002728.000|TR0|tried so hard to beat you in that 
20101223002728.000|20101223002730.000|TR0|campaign.  You won the campaign.  You came 
20101223002730.000|20101223002732.000|TR0|back and you had what by all accounts was 
20101223002732.000|20101223002735.000|TR0|a very successful lame duck session.  How?
20101223002735.000|20101223002737.000|TR0|
20101223002737.000|20101223002739.000|TR0|SENATOR HARRY REID, (D) MAJORITY LEADER:  
20101223002739.000|20101223002741.000|TR0|The midterm elections proved to me, 
20101223002741.000|20101223002743.000|TR0|Democrats, and Republicans that during 
20101223002743.000|20101223002746.000|TR0|this lame duck session, what the American 
20101223002746.000|20101223002748.000|TR0|people wanted was for us to work together.
20101223002748.000|20101223002750.000|TR0|
20101223002750.000|20101223002752.000|TR0|I think you saw in this very short 
20101223002752.000|20101223002754.000|TR0|congested work period we had is Democrats 
20101223002754.000|20101223002757.000|TR0|and Republicans were working together.  We 
20101223002757.000|20101223002759.000|TR0|accomplished a lot of stuff and we did it 
20101223002759.000|20101223002801.000|TR0|because we worked together.

20101223002810.000|20101223002812.000|TR0|Carolina.  He believes you took it to the 
20101223002812.000|20101223002814.000|TR0|Republicans pretty good.  Listen to his

20101223002823.000|20101223002825.000|TR0|SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH 
20101223002825.000|20101223002827.000|TR0|CAROLINA:  When it's all going to be said 
20101223002827.000|20101223002829.000|TR0|and done, Harry Reid has eaten our lunch. 
20101223002829.000|20101223002832.000|TR0|This has been a capitulation in two weeks 
20101223002832.000|20101223002834.000|TR0|of dramatic proportions of policies that 
20101223002834.000|20101223002836.000|TR0|wouldn't have passed in the new Congress.

20101223002843.000|20101223002845.000|TR0|KING:  Did you eat the Republican's lunch? 
20101223002845.000|20101223002847.000|TR0|Get them to capitulate on things that 
20101223002847.000|20101223002849.000|TR0|would never have passed next time?
20101223002849.000|20101223002851.000|TR0|
20101223002851.000|20101223002854.000|TR0|REID:  Lindsey Graham and I are friends.  
20101223002854.000|20101223002856.000|TR0|I'm sorry he feels that way.  I'm sorry he 
20101223002856.000|20101223002858.000|TR0|didn't join with us.  He's an outstanding 
20101223002858.000|20101223002900.000|TR0|advocate and I'm sure we will work 
20101223002900.000|20101223002902.000|TR0|together in the future.  Let's not talk 
20101223002902.000|20101223002905.000|TR0|about Harry Reid eating their lunch.  What 
20101223002905.000|20101223002907.000|TR0|we were able to do together, very, very 
20101223002907.000|20101223002909.000|TR0|good things for our country.
20101223002909.000|20101223002911.000|TR0|
20101223002911.000|20101223002913.000|TR0|KING:  On the floor on Friday when you 
20101223002913.000|20101223002916.000|TR0|were fighting for the START Treaty, at a 
20101223002916.000|20101223002918.000|TR0|time when its future, its ratification was 
20101223002918.000|20101223002920.000|TR0|in doubt, you said of all the things done 
20101223002920.000|20101223002922.000|TR0|in this Congress, there was nothing, 
20101223002922.000|20101223002924.000|TR0|nothing more important than this START 
20101223002924.000|20101223002927.000|TR0|Treaty.
20101223002927.000|20101223002929.000|TR0|
20101223002929.000|20101223002931.000|TR0|Those are your words.  Do you really 
20101223002931.000|20101223002933.000|TR0|believe that?  Health care reform was 
20101223002933.000|20101223002935.000|TR0|passed, financial reform, the repeal of 
20101223002935.000|20101223002938.000|TR0|"Don't Ask, Don't Tell."  Is START Treaty 
20101223002938.000|20101223002940.000|TR0|the most important or is that a bit of 
20101223002940.000|20101223002942.000|TR0|hyperbole at the moment?
20101223002942.000|20101223002944.000|TR0|
20101223002944.000|20101223002946.000|TR0|REID:  Well, you know, John, whatever I'm 
20101223002946.000|20101223002949.000|TR0|working on at the time seems the most 
20101223002949.000|20101223002951.000|TR0|important.
20101223002951.000|20101223002953.000|TR0|
20101223002953.000|20101223002955.000|TR0|KING:  In context, what do you think, 
20101223002955.000|20101223002957.000|TR0|looking back at the past two years not the 
20101223002957.000|20101223003000.000|TR0|past two weeks, what was the most 
20101223003000.000|20101223003002.000|TR0|important thing you did?
20101223003002.000|20101223003004.000|TR0|
20101223003004.000|20101223003006.000|TR0|REID:  Well, as I look back over this 
20101223003006.000|20101223003008.000|TR0|Congress, it was so many things we worked 
20101223003008.000|20101223003011.000|TR0|so hard on.  I mean, something like the 
20101223003011.000|20101223003013.000|TR0|public lands bill.  That was hard to get 
20101223003013.000|20101223003015.000|TR0|done.  Lily Ledbetter.
20101223003015.000|20101223003017.000|TR0|
20101223003017.000|20101223003019.000|TR0|For the first time in the history of our 
20101223003019.000|20101223003022.000|TR0|country, we now have the FDI controlling 
20101223003022.000|20101223003024.000|TR0|tobacco.  Credit card legislation.  We did 
20101223003024.000|20101223003026.000|TR0|health care reform.  We did Wall Street 
20101223003026.000|20101223003028.000|TR0|reform.  We did national service 
20101223003028.000|20101223003030.000|TR0|legislation.  We did the HIRE act, Small 
20101223003030.000|20101223003033.000|TR0|Business Administration that was so 
20101223003033.000|20101223003035.000|TR0|important to stimulate the economy as much 
20101223003035.000|20101223003037.000|TR0|as it did.
20101223003037.000|20101223003039.000|TR0|
20101223003039.000|20101223003041.000|TR0|So there isn't any one thing that I look 
20101223003041.000|20101223003044.000|TR0|back on as the thing that is the most 
20101223003044.000|20101223003046.000|TR0|important.  I say everything that we 
20101223003046.000|20101223003048.000|TR0|worked on at the time was extremely 
20101223003048.000|20101223003050.000|TR0|important.
20101223003050.000|20101223003052.000|TR0|
20101223003052.000|20101223003055.000|TR0|KING:  One of the things that came up in 
20101223003055.000|20101223003057.000|TR0|the lame-duck session that you were forced 
20101223003057.000|20101223003059.000|TR0|to compromise on, was you tried to bring 
20101223003059.000|20101223003101.000|TR0|the 1,900 page on to the spending bill to 
20101223003101.000|20101223003103.000|TR0|the floor and there were a lot of 
20101223003103.000|20101223003106.000|TR0|complaints that it was loaded up with 
20101223003106.000|20101223003108.000|TR0|earmarks.  You went to the floor and 
20101223003108.000|20101223003110.000|TR0|called the Republicans hypocrites.  Saying 
20101223003110.000|20101223003112.000|TR0|they were criticizing that bill, but in a 
20101223003112.000|20101223003114.000|TR0|little bit of a wink that they cynically 
20101223003114.000|20101223003116.000|TR0|wanted it to pass, even though they were 
20101223003116.000|20101223003119.000|TR0|criticizing, because they wanted all their 
20101223003119.000|20101223003121.000|TR0|earmarks.
20101223003121.000|20101223003123.000|TR0|
20101223003123.000|20101223003125.000|TR0|Then the Republicans did hold together, 
20101223003125.000|20101223003127.000|TR0|sir, and they forced you to pull that from 
20101223003127.000|20101223003130.000|TR0|the floor and instead negotiate what we 
20101223003130.000|20101223003132.000|TR0|call a continuing resolution, here in 
20101223003132.000|20101223003134.000|TR0|Washington, to fund the government through 
20101223003134.000|20101223003136.000|TR0|March.  No earmarks.  Do you owe those 
20101223003136.000|20101223003138.000|TR0|Republicans an apology?
20101223003138.000|20101223003141.000|TR0|
20101223003141.000|20101223003143.000|TR0|REID:  Oh, of course not.
20101223003143.000|20101223003145.000|TR0|
20101223003145.000|20101223003147.000|TR0|KING:  But how raw -- how raw did you feel 
20101223003147.000|20101223003149.000|TR0|personally, being essentially iced out of 
20101223003149.000|20101223003152.000|TR0|these negotiations in the end, when it was 
20101223003152.000|20101223003154.000|TR0|the vice president negotiating with Leader 
20101223003154.000|20101223003156.000|TR0|McConnell and the Republicans on the other 
20101223003156.000|20101223003158.000|TR0|side, a tax compromise deal that you and 
20101223003158.000|20101223003200.000|TR0|the leadership of the House knew nothing 
20101223003200.000|20101223003203.000|TR0|about at the outset?
20101223003203.000|20101223003205.000|TR0|
20101223003205.000|20101223003207.000|TR0|REID:  John, I was not iced out.  I made a 
20101223003207.000|20101223003209.000|TR0|decision not to get involved in the 
20101223003209.000|20101223003211.000|TR0|negotiations.  I was invited to many 
20101223003211.000|20101223003214.000|TR0|meetings.  The president will tell you 
20101223003214.000|20101223003216.000|TR0|that.  Joe Biden will tell you that.  I 
20101223003216.000|20101223003218.000|TR0|made a decision that these negotiations 
20101223003218.000|20101223003220.000|TR0|were something that I thought the 
20101223003220.000|20101223003222.000|TR0|president should do on his own.  I did not 
20101223003222.000|20101223003225.000|TR0|want to go to my caucus and tell the 
20101223003225.000|20101223003227.000|TR0|caucus I'd agreed to these tax cuts for 
20101223003227.000|20101223003229.000|TR0|rich people.  I'm satisfied with the 
20101223003229.000|20101223003231.000|TR0|ultimate package.  Think the president did 
20101223003231.000|20101223003233.000|TR0|an outstanding job of negotiating things 
20101223003233.000|20101223003236.000|TR0|for the American people.  But I was not in 
20101223003236.000|20101223003238.000|TR0|favor of tax cuts for people making more 
20101223003238.000|20101223003240.000|TR0|than $1 million a year.
20101223003240.000|20101223003242.000|TR0|
20101223003242.000|20101223003244.000|TR0|KING:  As you know, you personally don't 
20101223003244.000|20101223003247.000|TR0|like that.  Many members of your caucus 
20101223003247.000|20101223003249.000|TR0|don't like that on the House side.  That 
20101223003249.000|20101223003251.000|TR0|you might say it is even a bit more 
20101223003251.000|20101223003253.000|TR0|intense.  I want you to listen to Peter 
20101223003253.000|20101223003255.000|TR0|DeFazio who was furious at the president 
20101223003255.000|20101223003258.000|TR0|for negotiating this compromise.
20101223003258.000|20101223003300.000|TR0|
20101223003300.000|20101223003302.000|TR0|He said, "The president has allowed 
20101223003302.000|20101223003304.000|TR0|himself to be blackmailed by the Senate 
20101223003304.000|20101223003306.000|TR0|Republicans and I will not support it.  
20101223003306.000|20101223003309.000|TR0|Compromise requires give and take, but 
20101223003309.000|20101223003311.000|TR0|once again, the middle class gave and the 
20101223003311.000|20101223003313.000|TR0|millionaires took."
20101223003313.000|20101223003315.000|TR0|
20101223003315.000|20101223003317.000|TR0|Are you worried that this is -- in the 
20101223003317.000|20101223003320.000|TR0|Clinton days, we called it triangulation.  
20101223003320.000|20101223003322.000|TR0|Is this a new Barack Obama?  Is he going 
20101223003322.000|20101223003324.000|TR0|to put himself ahead of what the 
20101223003324.000|20101223003326.000|TR0|Democratic base thinks?
20101223003326.000|20101223003328.000|TR0|
20101223003328.000|20101223003331.000|TR0|REID:  I know Peter DeFazio very, very 
20101223003331.000|20101223003333.000|TR0|well.  I like him a lot. But he's wrong.  
20101223003333.000|20101223003335.000|TR0|The president did a very, very good job of 
20101223003335.000|20101223003337.000|TR0|making sure that the American people were 
20101223003337.000|20101223003339.000|TR0|taken care of.  That the economy continues 
20101223003339.000|20101223003342.000|TR0|to grow; that people who are out of work 
20101223003342.000|20101223003344.000|TR0|can drawn unemployment benefits still.  
20101223003344.000|20101223003346.000|TR0|That the great middle-class programs that 
20101223003346.000|20101223003348.000|TR0|were destined to go out of business are 
20101223003348.000|20101223003350.000|TR0|now part of the law of this country, 
20101223003350.000|20101223003353.000|TR0|because of Barack Obama and Joe Biden.  
20101223003353.000|20101223003355.000|TR0|They did an outstanding job.  And even 
20101223003355.000|20101223003357.000|TR0|though I like Peter DeFazio.  He's 
20101223003357.000|20101223003359.000|TR0|absolutely wrong.  The president did a 
20101223003359.000|20101223003401.000|TR0|good job.  He did a good job without me.
20101223003401.000|20101223003403.000|TR0|
20101223003403.000|20101223003406.000|TR0|KING:  Did the president do a good job 
20101223003406.000|20101223003408.000|TR0|when he said those who were criticizing 
20101223003408.000|20101223003410.000|TR0|him, including Mr. DeFazio, and many 
20101223003410.000|20101223003412.000|TR0|members of your conference, were 
20101223003412.000|20101223003414.000|TR0|sanctimonious?
20101223003414.000|20101223003417.000|TR0|
20101223003417.000|20101223003419.000|TR0|REID:  I've heard that term kicked around 
20101223003419.000|20101223003421.000|TR0|a little bit.  But it is easy to take 
20101223003421.000|20101223003423.000|TR0|words out of context.  I don't do much 
20101223003423.000|20101223003425.000|TR0|name calling, on purpose.  So I don't know 
20101223003425.000|20101223003428.000|TR0|what that is all about.  But I don't 
20101223003428.000|20101223003430.000|TR0|consider that anything that was directed 
20101223003430.000|20101223003432.000|TR0|toward me.
20101223003432.000|20101223003434.000|TR0|
20101223003434.000|20101223003436.000|TR0|KING:  You're auditioning for secretary of 
20101223003436.000|20101223003439.000|TR0|State here, it's quite admirable, Leader 
20101223003439.000|20101223003441.000|TR0|Reid.
20101223003441.000|20101223003443.000|TR0|
20101223003443.000|20101223003445.000|TR0|I want to look ahead to the next Congress, 
20101223003445.000|20101223003447.000|TR0|because when you come back, you will have 
20101223003447.000|20101223003450.000|TR0|a Republican speaker of the House, John 
20101223003450.000|20101223003452.000|TR0|Boehner. You will still be a leader in the 
20101223003452.000|20101223003454.000|TR0|Senate, but you'll have a more narrow 
20101223003454.000|20101223003456.000|TR0|Democratic majority.  Here's what leader 
20101223003456.000|20101223003458.000|TR0|McConnell said just the other day, to 
20101223003458.000|20101223003501.000|TR0|Politico.
20101223003501.000|20101223003503.000|TR0|
20101223003503.000|20101223003505.000|TR0|"There's much for Democrats to be angst 
20101223003505.000|20101223003507.000|TR0|ridden about.  If they think it's bad now, 
20101223003507.000|20101223003509.000|TR0|wait till next year.:
20101223003509.000|20101223003512.000|TR0|
20101223003512.000|20101223003514.000|TR0|What do you think he meant?       REID:  I 
20101223003514.000|20101223003516.000|TR0|don't know what he meant by that.  I think 
20101223003516.000|20101223003518.000|TR0|that now that we have 53 and not 58, I 
20101223003518.000|20101223003520.000|TR0|think that we're going to be obligated to 
20101223003520.000|20101223003523.000|TR0|make sure that Mitch McConnell believes 
20101223003523.000|20101223003525.000|TR0|he's part of the process.  I'm going to do 
20101223003525.000|20101223003527.000|TR0|everything I can to work with Mitch.  He 
20101223003527.000|20101223003529.000|TR0|and I have a very fine relationship.  And 
20101223003529.000|20101223003531.000|TR0|I don't know why he made that statement.  
20101223003531.000|20101223003534.000|TR0|But I -- he's made statements to me 
20101223003534.000|20101223003536.000|TR0|personally that he wants to get a lot of 
20101223003536.000|20101223003538.000|TR0|things done.
20101223003538.000|20101223003540.000|TR0|
20101223003540.000|20101223003542.000|TR0|We have an idea of how we can get things 
20101223003542.000|20101223003545.000|TR0|done.  We're going to try to get our 
20101223003545.000|20101223003547.000|TR0|appropriation bills done.  We are going to 
20101223003547.000|20101223003549.000|TR0|have a run at energy legislation.  As you 
20101223003549.000|20101223003551.000|TR0|know, there's a number of Republicans who 
20101223003551.000|20101223003553.000|TR0|want to do comprehensive immigration 
20101223003553.000|20101223003556.000|TR0|reform.  I look forward to working with 
20101223003556.000|20101223003558.000|TR0|them on that issue.
20101223003558.000|20101223003600.000|TR0|
20101223003600.000|20101223003602.000|TR0|So I'm not going to be challenging what 
20101223003602.000|20101223003604.000|TR0|Mitch said, in whatever setting he was in, 
20101223003604.000|20101223003607.000|TR0|other than to say that my conversation 
20101223003607.000|20101223003609.000|TR0|with him had been very positive about the 
20101223003609.000|20101223003611.000|TR0|next year.
20101223003611.000|20101223003613.000|TR0|
20101223003613.000|20101223003615.000|TR0|KING:  You truly believe things of that 
20101223003615.000|20101223003618.000|TR0|size, scope and importance can get done 
20101223003618.000|20101223003620.000|TR0|when we come out to a new year with 
20101223003620.000|20101223003622.000|TR0|divided government in which, Sir, you know 
20101223003622.000|20101223003624.000|TR0|this as well as I do, the presidential 
20101223003624.000|20101223003626.000|TR0|campaign in 2012 will be starting even 
20101223003626.000|20101223003629.000|TR0|before we say Happy New Year?
20101223003629.000|20101223003631.000|TR0|
20101223003631.000|20101223003633.000|TR0|REID:  Some of the most important 
20101223003633.000|20101223003635.000|TR0|legislation has been passed with divided 
20101223003635.000|20101223003637.000|TR0|government.  There's nothing wrong with 
20101223003637.000|20101223003640.000|TR0|divided government.  I would rather that 
20101223003640.000|20101223003642.000|TR0|we still had 60 votes in the Senate, and 
20101223003642.000|20101223003644.000|TR0|we had the White House, and we had a heavy 
20101223003644.000|20101223003646.000|TR0|majority in the House. But that's not the 
20101223003646.000|20101223003648.000|TR0|way it is.  Divided government does not 
20101223003648.000|20101223003651.000|TR0|mean you can't get things done.  
20101223003651.000|20101223003653.000|TR0|Legislation is the art of compromise.  And 
20101223003653.000|20101223003655.000|TR0|when you have divide government, that's 
20101223003655.000|20101223003657.000|TR0|when you have to compromise.
20101223003657.000|20101223003659.000|TR0|
20101223003659.000|20101223003701.000|TR0|KING:  That's a nice place to stop and 
20101223003701.000|20101223003704.000|TR0|wish you a great holiday, Sir.  Wish you a 
20101223003704.000|20101223003706.000|TR0|well-deserved break and send our best 
20101223003706.000|20101223003708.000|TR0|wishes to your wife as well.

20101223003728.000|20101223003730.000|TR0|holiday season? The Chairwoman of the

20101223003743.000|20101223003745.000|TR0|term underwear bomber entered our lexicon 
20101223003745.000|20101223003748.000|TR0|after a failed Christmas Day attempt to 
20101223003748.000|20101223003750.000|TR0|blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner using

20101223003823.000|20101223003825.000|TR0|plans to carry out attacks and the 
20101223003825.000|20101223003827.000|TR0|Department of State had issued an advisory

20101223003829.000|20101223003832.000|TR0|to try to carry out attacks there.  We do 
20101223003832.000|20101223003834.000|TR0|not limit our focus to one geographical 
20101223003834.000|20101223003836.000|TR0|area that is why we are constantly looking

20101223003920.000|20101223003922.000|TR0|his message seemed to be, we're on top of

20101223003942.000|20101223003944.000|TR0|There is a continuing threat.  It's been 
20101223003944.000|20101223003946.000|TR0|in the news that there's a believability 
20101223003946.000|20101223003948.000|TR0|that Al Qaeda does have people in this 
20101223003948.000|20101223003951.000|TR0|country, but there is no specific threat 
20101223003951.000|20101223003953.000|TR0|that I'm aware of that the time.
20101223003953.000|20101223003955.000|TR0|
20101223003955.000|20101223003957.000|TR0|KING:  As you know, of course, we ask the 
20101223003957.000|20101223003959.000|TR0|questions with a little bit more urgency 
20101223003959.000|20101223004002.000|TR0|because of what happened last year, the 
20101223004002.000|20101223004004.000|TR0|underwear bomber, Mr. Abdulmutallab.
20101223004004.000|20101223004006.000|TR0|
20101223004006.000|20101223004008.000|TR0|FEINSTEIN:  That's right.
20101223004008.000|20101223004010.000|TR0|
20101223004010.000|20101223004013.000|TR0|KING:  Is there anything, when you look at 
20101223004013.000|20101223004015.000|TR0|the chatter now, the intelligence now, do 
20101223004015.000|20101223004017.000|TR0|you go back and compare it?  Because we 
20101223004017.000|20101223004019.000|TR0|obviously didn't see this coming then?
20101223004019.000|20101223004021.000|TR0|
20101223004021.000|20101223004024.000|TR0|FEINSTEIN:  I would assess that we're at 
20101223004024.000|20101223004026.000|TR0|heightened vulnerability over the 
20101223004026.000|20101223004028.000|TR0|Christmas season based on past practice.  
20101223004028.000|20101223004030.000|TR0|I think you have to assume that.  And you 
20101223004030.000|20101223004032.000|TR0|have to prepare for it.  And you know, Al 
20101223004032.000|20101223004035.000|TR0|Qaeda is going to come after us if they 
20101223004035.000|20101223004037.000|TR0|can.  There's no question about that.  
20101223004037.000|20101223004039.000|TR0|Some have questioned, you know, whether we 
20101223004039.000|20101223004041.000|TR0|need to be vigilant. I would say yes, we 
20101223004041.000|20101223004043.000|TR0|really need t be vigilant.  There's no 
20101223004043.000|20101223004046.000|TR0|question about that.
20101223004046.000|20101223004048.000|TR0|
20101223004048.000|20101223004050.000|TR0|KING:  Also important is improving 
20101223004050.000|20101223004052.000|TR0|intelligence gathering and sharing 
20101223004052.000|20101223004054.000|TR0|information.  Are you convinced this 
20101223004054.000|20101223004057.000|TR0|Christmas season the United States 
20101223004057.000|20101223004059.000|TR0|government and its friends around the 
20101223004059.000|20101223004101.000|TR0|world are doing a better job at preventing 
20101223004101.000|20101223004103.000|TR0|someone from getting on a plane with 
20101223004103.000|20101223004105.000|TR0|explosives in their underwear, and other 
20101223004105.000|20101223004108.000|TR0|key steps?  Better this year than last 
20101223004108.000|20101223004110.000|TR0|year?       FEINSTEIN:  I would say so.  I 
20101223004110.000|20101223004112.000|TR0|think the failures from the Abdulmutallab 
20101223004112.000|20101223004114.000|TR0|incident which were 14 to be specific, we 
20101223004114.000|20101223004116.000|TR0|in the Intelligence Committee looked at 
20101223004116.000|20101223004119.000|TR0|very carefully and sent a series of 
20101223004119.000|20101223004121.000|TR0|findings and recommendations to the 
20101223004121.000|20101223004123.000|TR0|administration.  It's my understanding 
20101223004123.000|20101223004125.000|TR0|that every one of them has been corrected. 
20101223004125.000|20101223004127.000|TR0| So I would have to assume that we're in a 
20101223004127.000|20101223004130.000|TR0|much better place.
20101223004130.000|20101223004132.000|TR0|
20101223004132.000|20101223004134.000|TR0|KING:  We have talked many times in recent 
20101223004134.000|20101223004136.000|TR0|years about improvements, attempts at 
20101223004136.000|20101223004138.000|TR0|improvements, and some missteps in the 
20101223004138.000|20101223004141.000|TR0|years after 9/11 at making the agencies 
20101223004141.000|20101223004143.000|TR0|not only better, each of themselves, but 
20101223004143.000|20101223004145.000|TR0|better communication.  I want -- I'm sure 
20101223004145.000|20101223004147.000|TR0|you've seen this but I want to play this 
20101223004147.000|20101223004149.000|TR0|for any of our viewers who have not seen 
20101223004149.000|20101223004152.000|TR0|this. Diane Sawyer of ABC News sat down 
20101223004152.000|20101223004154.000|TR0|with three of the president's top 
20101223004154.000|20101223004156.000|TR0|officials and was asking the director of 
20101223004156.000|20101223004158.000|TR0|National Intelligence about arrests that 
20101223004158.000|20101223004200.000|TR0|happened in London 12 hours before the

20101223004322.000|20101223004324.000|TR0|
20101223004324.000|20101223004326.000|TR0|FEINSTEIN:  Well, first of all, Director 
20101223004326.000|20101223004328.000|TR0|Clapper was meeting with members of the 
20101223004328.000|20101223004330.000|TR0|Senate on the ratification of the START 
20101223004330.000|20101223004333.000|TR0|Treaty.  Pretty important.  If that were 
20101223004333.000|20101223004335.000|TR0|me, I'd be a little bit upset with my 
20101223004335.000|20101223004337.000|TR0|staff because before I went on television, 
20101223004337.000|20101223004339.000|TR0|I would have expected that my staff would 
20101223004339.000|20101223004341.000|TR0|have alerted me as to anything that came 
20101223004341.000|20101223004344.000|TR0|in.  So that's a point that I would make.
20101223004344.000|20101223004346.000|TR0|
20101223004346.000|20101223004348.000|TR0|KING:  He's the director of National 
20101223004348.000|20101223004350.000|TR0|Intelligence?       FEINSTEIN:  Yes, yes, 
20101223004350.000|20101223004352.000|TR0|yes.  John, but wait a second.  We have a 
20101223004352.000|20101223004355.000|TR0|major national security treaty before the 
20101223004355.000|20101223004357.000|TR0|Senate.  About to be voted on within the 
20101223004357.000|20101223004359.000|TR0|hour.  Up to yesterday, we didn't know 
20101223004359.000|20101223004401.000|TR0|where the votes really were.  And Director 
20101223004401.000|20101223004403.000|TR0|Clapper has been over here.  We had a 
20101223004403.000|20101223004406.000|TR0|three-hour secure briefing.  He was 
20101223004406.000|20101223004408.000|TR0|closeted in a room.  Members were coming 
20101223004408.000|20101223004410.000|TR0|in to see him one by one.  I don't think 
20101223004410.000|20101223004412.000|TR0|you can blame Director Clapper for this.
20101223004412.000|20101223004414.000|TR0|
20101223004414.000|20101223004417.000|TR0|Getting the news to him, that's the job of 
20101223004417.000|20101223004419.000|TR0|the Counterterrorism Center.  It's the job 
20101223004419.000|20101223004421.000|TR0|of his staff.  And I think he will pick up 
20101223004421.000|20101223004423.000|TR0|on that.  He's a very direct man.  He was 
20101223004423.000|20101223004425.000|TR0|working very hard.  I can testify to that. 
20101223004425.000|20101223004428.000|TR0| And I think to, you know, push this to 
20101223004428.000|20101223004430.000|TR0|any elevated status is a big fat mistake.  
20101223004430.000|20101223004432.000|TR0|It's making a -- what is it?  A tempest

20101223004436.000|20101223004439.000|TR0|KING:  So, you see a staff problem and a

20101223004441.000|20101223004443.000|TR0|problem?

20101223004445.000|20101223004447.000|TR0|FEINSTEIN:  Yes, someone should have 
20101223004447.000|20101223004450.000|TR0|informed him what was happening before he 
20101223004450.000|20101223004452.000|TR0|went on TV, absolutely.  And informed him 
20101223004452.000|20101223004454.000|TR0|of it, as soon as they knew of it.  No 
20101223004454.000|20101223004456.000|TR0|question about that in my mind.

20101223004501.000|20101223004503.000|TR0|security question. The administration is 
20101223004503.000|20101223004505.000|TR0|now preparing an executive order that 
20101223004505.000|20101223004507.000|TR0|we're told would allow the president to 
20101223004507.000|20101223004509.000|TR0|hold people indefinitely at Guantanamo 
20101223004509.000|20101223004512.000|TR0|Bay, Cuba.  They would have a new review 
20101223004512.000|20101223004514.000|TR0|process so every year or so they could 
20101223004514.000|20101223004516.000|TR0|have lawyers and they could make their 
20101223004516.000|20101223004518.000|TR0|case they should not be held any longer.  
20101223004518.000|20101223004520.000|TR0|This was a president who promised to end 
20101223004520.000|20101223004522.000|TR0|indefinite detentions and promised, to end 
20101223004522.000|20101223004525.000|TR0|most indefinite detentions and who 
20101223004525.000|20101223004527.000|TR0|promised to close GITMO.
20101223004527.000|20101223004529.000|TR0|
20101223004529.000|20101223004531.000|TR0|Are you OK with this order?  Do you think 
20101223004531.000|20101223004533.000|TR0|it's the right thing or the wrong thing?
20101223004533.000|20101223004536.000|TR0|
20101223004536.000|20101223004538.000|TR0|FEINSTEIN:  Well, we're just in the 
20101223004538.000|20101223004540.000|TR0|process of reviewing it right now.  There 
20101223004540.000|20101223004542.000|TR0|are people who are not going to be 
20101223004542.000|20101223004544.000|TR0|released, because they are a threat.  And 
20101223004544.000|20101223004547.000|TR0|they were captured on the battlefield.  
20101223004547.000|20101223004549.000|TR0|And for one reason or another, they cannot 
20101223004549.000|20101223004551.000|TR0|be tried.  So indefinite detention most 
20101223004551.000|20101223004553.000|TR0|likely is going to be a part of this.
20101223004553.000|20101223004555.000|TR0|
20101223004555.000|20101223004558.000|TR0|Now, how you provide due process in that 
20101223004558.000|20101223004600.000|TR0|situation remains to be seen; whether you 
20101223004600.000|20101223004602.000|TR0|have an annual review, a biannual review, 
20101223004602.000|20101223004604.000|TR0|whether the individual's entitled to 
20101223004604.000|20101223004606.000|TR0|counsel at that time.  These are things 
20101223004606.000|20101223004609.000|TR0|that need to be worked out.  But the 
20101223004609.000|20101223004611.000|TR0|United States government certainly should 
20101223004611.000|20101223004613.000|TR0|not release somebody captured on the 
20101223004613.000|20101223004615.000|TR0|battlefield, who is a continuing threat to 
20101223004615.000|20101223004617.000|TR0|the well being of our country.

20101223004637.000|20101223004639.000|TR0|KING:  When we come back, the president 
20101223004639.000|20101223004642.000|TR0|makes history signing the legislation 
20101223004642.000|20101223004644.000|TR0|repealing the "don't ask, don't tell".  
20101223004644.000|20101223004646.000|TR0|What does that say about the bigger gay 
20101223004646.000|20101223004648.000|TR0|rights debate?  Just ahead.

20101223004655.000|20101223004657.000|TR0|KING:  Such a busy day here in Washington, 
20101223004657.000|20101223004659.000|TR0|one might forget history was made this 
20101223004659.000|20101223004701.000|TR0|morning.  President Obama signed the 
20101223004701.000|20101223004704.000|TR0|legislation repealing the ban on gay 
20101223004704.000|20101223004706.000|TR0|Americans serving openly in the military. 
20101223004706.000|20101223004708.000|TR0|And as he celebrated the president did 
20101223004708.000|20101223004710.000|TR0|sound one cautionary note.  The Pentagon 
20101223004710.000|20101223004712.000|TR0|gets several months to plan a transition.  
20101223004712.000|20101223004715.000|TR0|So "don't ask, don't tell," will be the 
20101223004715.000|20101223004717.000|TR0|official policy for while still.

20101223004726.000|20101223004728.000|TR0|STATES:  It is especially important for 
20101223004728.000|20101223004730.000|TR0|service members to remember that.  I've 
20101223004730.000|20101223004732.000|TR0|spoken to every one of the service chiefs 
20101223004732.000|20101223004734.000|TR0|and they are all committed to implementing 
20101223004734.000|20101223004737.000|TR0|this change swiftly and efficiently.  
20101223004737.000|20101223004739.000|TR0|We're not going to be dragging our feet to 
20101223004739.000|20101223004741.000|TR0|get this done.

20101223004754.000|20101223004756.000|TR0|conference the president spoke of the 
20101223004756.000|20101223004759.000|TR0|evolving politics of gay rights, including 
20101223004759.000|20101223004801.000|TR0|his own rethinking of his long-standing 
20101223004801.000|20101223004803.000|TR0|opposition to same sex marriage.

20101223004810.000|20101223004812.000|TR0|OBAMA:  My feelings about this are 
20101223004812.000|20101223004814.000|TR0|constantly evolving.  I struggle with 
20101223004814.000|20101223004816.000|TR0|this.  I have friends, I have people who 
20101223004816.000|20101223004818.000|TR0|work for me, who are in powerful, strong 
20101223004818.000|20101223004820.000|TR0|long-lasting gay or lesbian unions.  And 
20101223004820.000|20101223004823.000|TR0|they are extraordinary people.  And this 
20101223004823.000|20101223004825.000|TR0|is something that means a lot to them.  
20101223004825.000|20101223004827.000|TR0|And they care deeply about.

20101223004834.000|20101223004836.000|TR0|KING:  So why the change?  What does it 
20101223004836.000|20101223004838.000|TR0|tell us about the politics of gay rights?  
20101223004838.000|20101223004840.000|TR0|Let's ask two men who make tracking public 
20101223004840.000|20101223004842.000|TR0|opinion their business.  Democrat Cornell

20101223004847.000|20101223004849.000|TR0|And let's begin by looking the numbers.  
20101223004849.000|20101223004851.000|TR0|We asked at CNN, in our polling recently, 
20101223004851.000|20101223004853.000|TR0|do you favor or oppose allowing gays to 
20101223004853.000|20101223004856.000|TR0|serve openly in the military:  72 percent 
20101223004856.000|20101223004858.000|TR0|of Americans say they favor that right; 23 
20101223004858.000|20101223004900.000|TR0|percent opposed.
20101223004900.000|20101223004902.000|TR0|
20101223004902.000|20101223004904.000|TR0|Slightly different question, but back in 
20101223004904.000|20101223004907.000|TR0|April 2009, do you favor or oppose "don't 
20101223004907.000|20101223004909.000|TR0|ask, don't tell", the current policy?  It 
20101223004909.000|20101223004911.000|TR0|was 48/47, so a split.  Why from a split, 
20101223004911.000|20101223004913.000|TR0|sort of a tough issue, to overwhelming 
20101223004913.000|20101223004915.000|TR0|support?

20101223004920.000|20101223004922.000|TR0|RESEARCH  &  STRATEGIES: I think we're 
20101223004922.000|20101223004924.000|TR0|watching history unfold right here in 
20101223004924.000|20101223004926.000|TR0|front of us.  If you go back to even 
20101223004926.000|20101223004929.000|TR0|before that time period, I mean there are 
20101223004929.000|20101223004931.000|TR0|gay rights issues, so gay marriage was a 
20101223004931.000|20101223004933.000|TR0|real strong wedge issue politically.  It's 
20101223004933.000|20101223004935.000|TR0|been softening.  And I've sort of watching 
20101223004935.000|20101223004937.000|TR0|the public support for it soften, to where 
20101223004937.000|20101223004940.000|TR0|you have 70 percent approve of it.  And 
20101223004940.000|20101223004942.000|TR0|even a majority in the military now saying 
20101223004942.000|20101223004944.000|TR0|it is OK.  I think we are watching, 
20101223004944.000|20101223004946.000|TR0|really, a transformation.  Really quickly, 
20101223004946.000|20101223004948.000|TR0|I don't think we saw the same thing with 
20101223004948.000|20101223004951.000|TR0|women's rights, or certainly not with 
20101223004951.000|20101223004953.000|TR0|civil rights.

20101223005013.000|20101223005015.000|TR0|GROUP:  I'm not quite sure. You do have to 
20101223005015.000|20101223005017.000|TR0|ask the question the same way to tell 
20101223005017.000|20101223005019.000|TR0|whether or not you're analyzing it the 
20101223005019.000|20101223005021.000|TR0|same way.
20101223005021.000|20101223005024.000|TR0|
20101223005024.000|20101223005026.000|TR0|I think what you had several years ago was 
20101223005026.000|20101223005028.000|TR0|military leaders was adamant this was not 
20101223005028.000|20101223005030.000|TR0|a policy that should go through.  And the 
20101223005030.000|20101223005032.000|TR0|American public not understanding exactly 
20101223005032.000|20101223005035.000|TR0|why it shouldn't, said, fine.  They were 
20101223005035.000|20101223005037.000|TR0|split on it.  The position of the military 
20101223005037.000|20101223005039.000|TR0|leaders were not as strong this time.  
20101223005039.000|20101223005041.000|TR0|They did get some coverage but not as 
20101223005041.000|20101223005043.000|TR0|strong.  So I think they've kind of moved 
20101223005043.000|20101223005046.000|TR0|back to where they were naturally, which 
20101223005046.000|20101223005048.000|TR0|is they don't understand why not.

20101223005050.000|20101223005052.000|TR0|KING:  So you separate the gays in the 
20101223005052.000|20101223005054.000|TR0|military issue from a broader conversation 
20101223005054.000|20101223005057.000|TR0|about public perception on gay rights?

20101223005059.000|20101223005101.000|TR0|GOEAS:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, you're 
20101223005101.000|20101223005103.000|TR0|not seeing the numbers change in terms of 
20101223005103.000|20101223005105.000|TR0|gay marriage.  Gay marriage is still 
20101223005105.000|20101223005107.000|TR0|overwhelmingly a majority say they're not 
20101223005107.000|20101223005110.000|TR0|for that.  Much different issue when it 
20101223005110.000|20101223005112.000|TR0|comes to gays in the military.  It's a 
20101223005112.000|20101223005114.000|TR0|policy that quite frankly the American 
20101223005114.000|20101223005116.000|TR0|public never understood.
20101223005116.000|20101223005118.000|TR0|
20101223005118.000|20101223005121.000|TR0|BELCHER:  But you wouldn't say that 
20101223005121.000|20101223005123.000|TR0|over-if you look back five or six years 
20101223005123.000|20101223005125.000|TR0|that even that number-now clearly, you 
20101223005125.000|20101223005127.000|TR0|don't have a mandate for gay marriage in 
20101223005127.000|20101223005129.000|TR0|this country, but you wouldn't say that 
20101223005129.000|20101223005132.000|TR0|number is softening?  Because in almost 
20101223005132.000|20101223005134.000|TR0|everything I'm seeing, that number 
20101223005134.000|20101223005136.000|TR0|actually is softening.  In particular it 
20101223005136.000|20101223005138.000|TR0|is soften with some part of even the 
20101223005138.000|20101223005140.000|TR0|Democratic base that I thought would be 
20101223005140.000|20101223005143.000|TR0|fractured, with African-Americans, who we 
20101223005143.000|20101223005145.000|TR0|saw some fracturing of that as a wedge 
20101223005145.000|20101223005147.000|TR0|issue before.
20101223005147.000|20101223005149.000|TR0|
20101223005149.000|20101223005151.000|TR0|KING:  Let me show the numbers to our 
20101223005151.000|20101223005154.000|TR0|viewers.  Just so they see them.  Should 
20101223005154.000|20101223005156.000|TR0|gay marriage be legal?  This is and ABC 
20101223005156.000|20101223005158.000|TR0|News/"Washington Post" poll in February of 
20101223005158.000|20101223005200.000|TR0|2010.  Legal, 47, illegal, 51.  Back in 
20101223005200.000|20101223005202.000|TR0|2005, the same poll, ABC/"Washington 
20101223005202.000|20101223005205.000|TR0|Post", legal, 39 percent, illegal, 58 
20101223005205.000|20101223005207.000|TR0|percent.  So a little bit of a shift there.
20101223005207.000|20101223005209.000|TR0|
20101223005209.000|20101223005211.000|TR0|BELCHER:  That is what I'm thinking.  I 
20101223005211.000|20101223005213.000|TR0|think there is really a softening there.
20101223005213.000|20101223005216.000|TR0|
20101223005216.000|20101223005218.000|TR0|GOEAS:  And two years before that, it was 
20101223005218.000|20101223005220.000|TR0|47/47, so?
20101223005220.000|20101223005222.000|TR0|
20101223005222.000|20101223005224.000|TR0|KING:  Right.  So here's the question, 
20101223005224.000|20101223005227.000|TR0|still a divide on the question of should 
20101223005227.000|20101223005229.000|TR0|same sex marriage be legal?  What about 
20101223005229.000|20101223005231.000|TR0|the politics of it?  George W. Bush very 
20101223005231.000|20101223005233.000|TR0|effectively, Republicans would argue, used 
20101223005233.000|20101223005235.000|TR0|this as his closing pitch in 2004.  When 
20101223005235.000|20101223005238.000|TR0|you looked at some close states, where 
20101223005238.000|20101223005240.000|TR0|cultural conservative turn out, maybe 
20101223005240.000|20101223005242.000|TR0|Ohio, say, a big battleground state, a lot 
20101223005242.000|20101223005244.000|TR0|of Republicans said that was part of the 
20101223005244.000|20101223005246.000|TR0|difference.  Can you use it as a wedge, 
20101223005246.000|20101223005249.000|TR0|gay rights, gay marriage, as a wedge, as 
20101223005249.000|20101223005251.000|TR0|it has been in the past?
20101223005251.000|20101223005253.000|TR0|
20101223005253.000|20101223005255.000|TR0|GOEAS:  I don't think it was used as a 
20101223005255.000|20101223005257.000|TR0|wedge as much as people thought.  Quite 
20101223005257.000|20101223005300.000|TR0|frankly, the only place we saw a 
20101223005300.000|20101223005302.000|TR0|difference was in the African-American 
20101223005302.000|20101223005304.000|TR0|community in the 2004 campaign.  When you 
20101223005304.000|20101223005306.000|TR0|saw a shift of about 7 percent, 8 percent 
20101223005306.000|20101223005308.000|TR0|of the African-American community vote 
20101223005308.000|20101223005311.000|TR0|Republican because of the gay marriage 
20101223005311.000|20101223005313.000|TR0|issue, not the gay rights issue.
20101223005313.000|20101223005315.000|TR0|
20101223005315.000|20101223005317.000|TR0|BELCHER:  I think they were masterful in 
20101223005317.000|20101223005319.000|TR0|using it-of course I'm going to disagree 
20101223005319.000|20101223005322.000|TR0|with you, Ed.  I think they were masterful 
20101223005322.000|20101223005324.000|TR0|in using it as a wedge issue particularly 
20101223005324.000|20101223005326.000|TR0|for energizing their base and pulling over 
20101223005326.000|20101223005328.000|TR0|some socially conservative groups that 
20101223005328.000|20101223005330.000|TR0|should have been us.  But I think sort of 
20101223005330.000|20101223005333.000|TR0|softening of this issue, as we see, is 
20101223005333.000|20101223005335.000|TR0|taking away its effect to use as a solid 
20101223005335.000|20101223005337.000|TR0|cultural wedge issue, hopefully for 
20101223005337.000|20101223005339.000|TR0|sometime to come.
20101223005339.000|20101223005341.000|TR0|
20101223005341.000|20101223005344.000|TR0|KING:  Actions cause reactions in our 
20101223005344.000|20101223005346.000|TR0|politics.  Since the "don't ask, don't 
20101223005346.000|20101223005348.000|TR0|tell" policy was repealed by the Congress, 
20101223005348.000|20101223005350.000|TR0|the president now signed it into law, you 
20101223005350.000|20101223005352.000|TR0|do see among social conservative groups a 
20101223005352.000|20101223005354.000|TR0|lot of criticism, a lot of pressure on 
20101223005354.000|20101223005357.000|TR0|lawmakers, and a lot of fundraising 
20101223005357.000|20101223005359.000|TR0|activities.  Will you see, you think, in 
20101223005359.000|20101223005401.000|TR0|the next campaign, because of this 
20101223005401.000|20101223005403.000|TR0|quote/unquote defeat for them on this 
20101223005403.000|20101223005405.000|TR0|issue, will they try to make it a bigger 
20101223005405.000|20101223005408.000|TR0|issue?
20101223005408.000|20101223005410.000|TR0|
20101223005410.000|20101223005412.000|TR0|GOEAS:  You may see it among some groups.  
20101223005412.000|20101223005414.000|TR0|It is not going to be the daily diet of 
20101223005414.000|20101223005416.000|TR0|Republicans and Republican campaigns.
20101223005416.000|20101223005419.000|TR0|
20101223005419.000|20101223005421.000|TR0|BELCHER:  And I think, you know, I think 
20101223005421.000|20101223005423.000|TR0|this is sort of monumental because it is 
20101223005423.000|20101223005425.000|TR0|sort of what Truman did, sort of for 
20101223005425.000|20101223005427.000|TR0|African- Americans in the military, sort 
20101223005427.000|20101223005430.000|TR0|of allow for the '50s and the civil rights 
20101223005430.000|20101223005432.000|TR0|movement to come along.  I think this 
20101223005432.000|20101223005434.000|TR0|allows for their human rights-we have to 
20101223005434.000|20101223005436.000|TR0|be careful about civil rights, because 
20101223005436.000|20101223005438.000|TR0|there's still some rifts in the 
20101223005438.000|20101223005441.000|TR0|communities about gay rights and civil 
20101223005441.000|20101223005443.000|TR0|rights.  But for their rights movement, 
20101223005443.000|20101223005445.000|TR0|it's sort of take one step further.
20101223005445.000|20101223005447.000|TR0|
20101223005447.000|20101223005449.000|TR0|KING:  Would this be-not just gay rights 
20101223005449.000|20101223005452.000|TR0|but any big cultural question like this, 
20101223005452.000|20101223005454.000|TR0|would it be a different conversation, 
20101223005454.000|20101223005456.000|TR0|would the politics have been different 
20101223005456.000|20101223005458.000|TR0|over past six, nine months if we had 4 
20101223005458.000|20101223005500.000|TR0|percent or 5 percent unemployment?  Does a 
20101223005500.000|20101223005503.000|TR0|bad economy make it easier to do these 
20101223005503.000|20101223005505.000|TR0|things?
20101223005505.000|20101223005507.000|TR0|
20101223005507.000|20101223005509.000|TR0|BELCHER:  I think that's absolutely right. 
20101223005509.000|20101223005511.000|TR0| I would argue that the-the image of sort 
20101223005511.000|20101223005514.000|TR0|of these cultural warriors, and even sort 
20101223005514.000|20101223005516.000|TR0|of a terrorist to a certain extent, was 
20101223005516.000|20101223005518.000|TR0|replaced by a white guy in a blue suit 
20101223005518.000|20101223005520.000|TR0|with a foreclosure note, for middle 
20101223005520.000|20101223005522.000|TR0|American, sort of scaring the heck out of 
20101223005522.000|20101223005525.000|TR0|middle America.  The economic angst of 
20101223005525.000|20101223005527.000|TR0|middle America, right now, I think does 
20101223005527.000|20101223005529.000|TR0|overshadow a lot of the typical cultural 
20101223005529.000|20101223005531.000|TR0|issues.
20101223005531.000|20101223005533.000|TR0|
20101223005533.000|20101223005536.000|TR0|GOEAS:  So does the spending in Washington 
20101223005536.000|20101223005538.000|TR0|in terms of the --
20101223005538.000|20101223005540.000|TR0|
20101223005540.000|20101223005542.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)      KING:  Let me ask, lastly, 
20101223005542.000|20101223005544.000|TR0|on these issues, is there a generational 
20101223005544.000|20101223005547.000|TR0|line?  If you talk to people, just look at 
20101223005547.000|20101223005549.000|TR0|the debate in Congress, you talk to 
20101223005549.000|20101223005551.000|TR0|Senator McCain who served in the military 
20101223005551.000|20101223005553.000|TR0|some time ago.  For him, this is like, no 
20101223005553.000|20101223005555.000|TR0|way, no way, no how.  Scott Brown, a 
20101223005555.000|20101223005558.000|TR0|Republican who served in the military, 
20101223005558.000|20101223005600.000|TR0|still in the Reserves, I believe, served 
20101223005600.000|20101223005602.000|TR0|more recently.  He thought about it and 
20101223005602.000|20101223005604.000|TR0|said, you know, I can do this.
20101223005604.000|20101223005606.000|TR0|
20101223005606.000|20101223005609.000|TR0|GOEAS:  Certainly see a generational 
20101223005609.000|20101223005611.000|TR0|difference.  But I would come back to the 
20101223005611.000|20101223005613.000|TR0|difference if you want to talk about gay 
20101223005613.000|20101223005615.000|TR0|marriage, it is the religious versus the 
20101223005615.000|20101223005617.000|TR0|nonreligious.  If they view marriage as a 
20101223005617.000|20101223005620.000|TR0|religious institution, a religious 
20101223005620.000|20101223005622.000|TR0|activity, then they view it much 
20101223005622.000|20101223005624.000|TR0|differently than civil marriage.  That's 
20101223005624.000|20101223005626.000|TR0|really the divide, it is not a cultural 
20101223005626.000|20101223005628.000|TR0|divide as much as a religious divide.
20101223005628.000|20101223005631.000|TR0|
20101223005631.000|20101223005633.000|TR0|BELCHER:  I think the religiosity of it 
20101223005633.000|20101223005635.000|TR0|has an absolute impact on it.  Although, I 
20101223005635.000|20101223005637.000|TR0|think your religiosity actually has 
20101223005637.000|20101223005639.000|TR0|something to do with where you are 
20101223005639.000|20101223005641.000|TR0|culturally, as well.
20101223005641.000|20101223005644.000|TR0|
20101223005644.000|20101223005646.000|TR0|KING:  Cornell Belcher, Ed Goeas, thank 
20101223005646.000|20101223005648.000|TR0|you very much.
20101223005648.000|20101223005650.000|TR0|
20101223005650.000|20101223005652.000|TR0|GOEAS:  Thank you.
20101223005652.000|20101223005655.000|TR0|
20101223005655.000|20101223005657.000|TR0|KING:  These days, when we want to make a 
20101223005657.000|20101223005659.000|TR0|point, we update our Facebook page or we 
20101223005659.000|20101223005701.000|TR0|Tweet.  Maybe we send an e-mail.  In the 
20101223005701.000|20101223005703.000|TR0|argument between North and South Korea, 
20101223005703.000|20101223005706.000|TR0|how about war of the faxes?  Pete on the 
20101223005706.000|20101223005708.000|TR0|Streets, on this one, next.
20101223005708.000|20101223005710.000|TR0|
20101223005710.000|20101223005712.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20101223005712.000|20101223005714.000|TR0|
20101223005714.000|20101223005717.000|TR0|KING:  Revenge of the faxes?  That's 
20101223005717.000|20101223005719.000|TR0|apparently how the North Koreans think 
20101223005719.000|20101223005721.000|TR0|they can get their message across to their 
20101223005721.000|20101223005723.000|TR0|neighbors in the South.  Pete Dominick has 
20101223005723.000|20101223005725.000|TR0|been tracking this one.
20101223005725.000|20101223005728.000|TR0|
20101223005728.000|20101223005730.000|TR0|Pete, what's this all about?
20101223005730.000|20101223005732.000|TR0|
20101223005732.000|20101223005734.000|TR0|PETE DOMINICK, PETE ON THE STREET:  Yeah, 
20101223005734.000|20101223005736.000|TR0|John King, apparently the North Korean 
20101223005736.000|20101223005739.000|TR0|regime sent some kind of mass propaganda 
20101223005739.000|20101223005741.000|TR0|via fax machine to South Korean companies 
20101223005741.000|20101223005743.000|TR0|and churches, and so on.  And, you know, I 
20101223005743.000|20101223005745.000|TR0|don't know much about too many things, 
20101223005745.000|20101223005747.000|TR0|John, but I do know a little bit about 
20101223005747.000|20101223005750.000|TR0|21st century communication.  When is the 
20101223005750.000|20101223005752.000|TR0|last time anyone used a fax machine?  
20101223005752.000|20101223005754.000|TR0|South Korean's arguably as technologically 
20101223005754.000|20101223005756.000|TR0|advanced as we in America.
20101223005756.000|20101223005758.000|TR0|
20101223005758.000|20101223005801.000|TR0|John King, I work at CNN every day.  And I 
20101223005801.000|20101223005803.000|TR0|work at SiriusXM everyday, two offices, I 
20101223005803.000|20101223005805.000|TR0|have no idea where the fax machine is.  
20101223005805.000|20101223005807.000|TR0|Wolf Blitzer was just in North Korea.  I 
20101223005807.000|20101223005809.000|TR0|got to ask him what his hotel in- room 
20101223005809.000|20101223005812.000|TR0|entertainment was? An Atari 2600, and 
20101223005812.000|20101223005814.000|TR0|eight-track player?  What's the next thing 
20101223005814.000|20101223005816.000|TR0|they'll use for propaganda?  Where's your 
20101223005816.000|20101223005818.000|TR0|fax machine? Do you know?
20101223005818.000|20101223005820.000|TR0|
20101223005820.000|20101223005823.000|TR0|KING:  It's next to the mimeograph.
20101223005823.000|20101223005825.000|TR0|
20101223005825.000|20101223005827.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Exactly, you guys are really 
20101223005827.000|20101223005829.000|TR0|arcane there.  Have you ever used a fax 
20101223005829.000|20101223005831.000|TR0|machine?  Has anybody?  When's the last 
20101223005831.000|20101223005834.000|TR0|time you saw a fax machine?  Miss?     I 
20101223005834.000|20101223005836.000|TR0|mean, no one -- last week, really?  You 
20101223005836.000|20101223005838.000|TR0|should upgrade your office, Sir.  Last 
20101223005838.000|20101223005840.000|TR0|year, John, somebody tried to book me in a 
20101223005840.000|20101223005842.000|TR0|stand-up gig.  They told me to fax them an 
20101223005842.000|20101223005845.000|TR0|I-9 form.  I just canceled the gig. I 
20101223005845.000|20101223005847.000|TR0|don't think I'll ever get the check.  Are 
20101223005847.000|20101223005849.000|TR0|you going to send it Pony Express?  I'm 
20101223005849.000|20101223005851.000|TR0|not too worried about the North Koreans at 
20101223005851.000|20101223005853.000|TR0|this point, John.
20101223005853.000|20101223005856.000|TR0|
20101223005856.000|20101223005858.000|TR0|KING:  The Dear Leader is going to send 
20101223005858.000|20101223005900.000|TR0|you a Tweet, objecting to your criticism 
20101223005900.000|20101223005902.000|TR0|of their strategies.
20101223005902.000|20101223005904.000|TR0|
20101223005904.000|20101223005907.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Good night, Dear Leader.
20101223005907.000|20101223005909.000|TR0|
20101223005909.000|20101223005911.000|TR0|KING:  That was the hologram Wolf Blitzer 
20101223005911.000|20101223005913.000|TR0|we sent to North Korea, Pete.  We are on 
20101223005913.000|20101223005915.000|TR0|top of the technology here.
20101223005915.000|20101223005918.000|TR0|
20101223005918.000|20101223005920.000|TR0|DOMINICK:  Oh, right.
20101223005920.000|20101223005922.000|TR0|
20101223005922.000|20101223005924.000|TR0|KING:  We'll see you tomorrow night.  
20101223005924.000|20101223005926.000|TR0|"PARKER SPITZER" starts right now.
20101223005926.000|20101223005928.000|TR0|
