20101223010007.000|20101223010009.000|TR0|KATHLEEN PARKER, CNN ANCHOR:  Good 
20101223010009.000|20101223010011.000|TR0|evening, welcome to the program.  I'm 
20101223010011.000|20101223010013.000|TR0|Kathleen Parker.
20101223010013.000|20101223010016.000|TR0|
20101223010016.000|20101223010018.000|TR0|ELIOT SPITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  And I'm Eliot 
20101223010018.000|20101223010020.000|TR0|Spitzer.  Up first tonight, our first 
20101223010020.000|20101223010023.000|TR0|glimpse behind the nuclear curtain in 
20101223010023.000|20101223010025.000|TR0|North Korea since nuclear war was averted 
20101223010025.000|20101223010027.000|TR0|earlier this week.
20101223010027.000|20101223010030.000|TR0|
20101223010030.000|20101223010032.000|TR0|An exclusive interview with New Mexico 
20101223010032.000|20101223010034.000|TR0|Governor Bill Richardson, the man who 
20101223010034.000|20101223010037.000|TR0|negotiated with North Koreans.  He may 
20101223010037.000|20101223010039.000|TR0|just have played the key role in stopping 
20101223010039.000|20101223010041.000|TR0|the launching of nuclear missiles.
20101223010041.000|20101223010044.000|TR0|
20101223010044.000|20101223010046.000|TR0|PARKER:  And even now South Korea is 
20101223010046.000|20101223010048.000|TR0|preparing to begin more military 
20101223010048.000|20101223010050.000|TR0|exercises, perhaps more provocation for 
20101223010050.000|20101223010053.000|TR0|North Korea.
20101223010053.000|20101223010055.000|TR0|
20101223010055.000|20101223010057.000|TR0|Joining us now from New Mexico, Governor 
20101223010057.000|20101223010100.000|TR0|Bill Richardson in his first in-depth 
20101223010100.000|20101223010102.000|TR0|interview since his return from North 
20101223010102.000|20101223010104.000|TR0|Korea.
20101223010104.000|20101223010107.000|TR0|
20101223010107.000|20101223010109.000|TR0|Welcome, Governor.
20101223010109.000|20101223010111.000|TR0|
20101223010111.000|20101223010114.000|TR0|GOV. BILL RICHARDSON (D), NEW MEXICO:  
20101223010114.000|20101223010116.000|TR0|Thank you.  Nice to be with you, guys.
20101223010116.000|20101223010118.000|TR0|
20101223010118.000|20101223010121.000|TR0|PARKER:  Glad you're home safely.  So just 
20101223010121.000|20101223010123.000|TR0|how close were we to war?
20101223010123.000|20101223010125.000|TR0|
20101223010125.000|20101223010128.000|TR0|RICHARDSON:  Well, we were very close.  
20101223010128.000|20101223010130.000|TR0|When I got there, the North Koreans were 
20101223010130.000|20101223010132.000|TR0|saying to me they were going to retaliate 
20101223010132.000|20101223010134.000|TR0|immensely.  The tension was very high.  It 
20101223010134.000|20101223010137.000|TR0|was a tinder box.
20101223010137.000|20101223010139.000|TR0|
20101223010139.000|20101223010141.000|TR0|And I said to them, look, this is the 
20101223010141.000|20101223010144.000|TR0|worst you can do if you retaliate.  This 
20101223010144.000|20101223010146.000|TR0|is a chance for you to be statesmen-like 
20101223010146.000|20101223010148.000|TR0|for a change, which you haven't been 
20101223010148.000|20101223010151.000|TR0|lately, and it's important that you also 
20101223010151.000|20101223010153.000|TR0|look at some arms control measures that I 
20101223010153.000|20101223010155.000|TR0|had proposed, more IAEA inspectors, sell 
20101223010155.000|20101223010158.000|TR0|your spent fuel rods, hotline, and I think 
20101223010158.000|20101223010200.000|TR0|they've turned the corner a little bit, 
20101223010200.000|20101223010202.000|TR0|recognizing they've got to be more 
20101223010202.000|20101223010205.000|TR0|pragmatic.
20101223010205.000|20101223010207.000|TR0|
20101223010207.000|20101223010209.000|TR0|SPITZER:  What's face fascinating is that 
20101223010209.000|20101223010211.000|TR0|what you're suggesting is that they 
20101223010211.000|20101223010214.000|TR0|responded to your -- not only your magic 
20101223010214.000|20101223010216.000|TR0|words and your brilliant oratorical skills 
20101223010216.000|20101223010218.000|TR0|but the rationale of what you were 
20101223010218.000|20101223010221.000|TR0|suggesting.
20101223010221.000|20101223010223.000|TR0|
20101223010223.000|20101223010225.000|TR0|And so would that -- do you want to 
20101223010225.000|20101223010228.000|TR0|believe that the North Koreans really are 
20101223010228.000|20101223010230.000|TR0|rational players here?  And that 
20101223010230.000|20101223010232.000|TR0|everything they've done until now is part 
20101223010232.000|20101223010235.000|TR0|of a concerted strategy to get to this 
20101223010235.000|20101223010237.000|TR0|result?
20101223010237.000|20101223010239.000|TR0|
20101223010239.000|20101223010242.000|TR0|RICHARDSON:  No, Eliot, you know, they're 
20101223010242.000|20101223010244.000|TR0|very unpredictable. You don't know what 
20101223010244.000|20101223010246.000|TR0|they're going to do next.  That's 
20101223010246.000|20101223010249.000|TR0|something I've learned dealing with them 
20101223010249.000|20101223010251.000|TR0|the last seven years.  They're going 
20101223010251.000|20101223010253.000|TR0|through a leadership issue right now with 
20101223010253.000|20101223010255.000|TR0|the youngest son of Kim Jong-Il probably 
20101223010255.000|20101223010258.000|TR0|being groomed to take over.
20101223010258.000|20101223010300.000|TR0|
20101223010300.000|20101223010302.000|TR0|So I think a lot of their recent actions 
20101223010302.000|20101223010305.000|TR0|that have been terrible, like the sinking 
20101223010305.000|20101223010307.000|TR0|of the ship, the killing of civilians, 
20101223010307.000|20101223010309.000|TR0|increased uranium activity, has been sort 
20101223010309.000|20101223010312.000|TR0|of internal shows of force.
20101223010312.000|20101223010314.000|TR0|
20101223010314.000|20101223010316.000|TR0|Look, I'm not taking credit for toning 
20101223010316.000|20101223010319.000|TR0|them down.  And I do think that my visit 
20101223010319.000|20101223010321.000|TR0|was timely.  That we had an impact.  That 
20101223010321.000|20101223010323.000|TR0|they responded.  Especially their military 
20101223010323.000|20101223010326.000|TR0|person that I talked to, the top military 
20101223010326.000|20101223010328.000|TR0|and the top nuclear negotiator was, look, 
20101223010328.000|20101223010330.000|TR0|you guys, if you want negotiations with 
20101223010330.000|20101223010332.000|TR0|the six-party countries.
20101223010332.000|20101223010335.000|TR0|
20101223010335.000|20101223010337.000|TR0|If you want to have some assistance in the 
20101223010337.000|20101223010339.000|TR0|areas of food -- your people are in very 
20101223010339.000|20101223010342.000|TR0|bad shape -- energy assistance, you want 
20101223010342.000|20101223010344.000|TR0|sanctions lifted eventually, you can't 
20101223010344.000|20101223010346.000|TR0|keep acting like this.  And one way that 
20101223010346.000|20101223010349.000|TR0|you can send a signal to the international 
20101223010349.000|20101223010351.000|TR0|community is take some arms control 
20101223010351.000|20101223010353.000|TR0|measures but don't retaliate.
20101223010353.000|20101223010356.000|TR0|
20101223010356.000|20101223010358.000|TR0|This is a drill by the South Koreans.  
20101223010358.000|20101223010400.000|TR0|It's -- they're legitimate self-defense.  
20101223010400.000|20101223010403.000|TR0|It's going to be a routine drill.  Stop 
20101223010403.000|20101223010405.000|TR0|all this rhetoric and act like 
20101223010405.000|20101223010407.000|TR0|international players and international 
20101223010407.000|20101223010410.000|TR0|community.  And I believe they responded.  
20101223010410.000|20101223010412.000|TR0|And things have cooled down a bit.  But 
20101223010412.000|20101223010414.000|TR0|it's still a tinder box out there.
20101223010414.000|20101223010416.000|TR0|
20101223010416.000|20101223010419.000|TR0|PARKER:  What -- you know, you say that 
20101223010419.000|20101223010421.000|TR0|you think your visit there was timely.  
20101223010421.000|20101223010423.000|TR0|And we would agree with that.  But we 
20101223010423.000|20101223010426.000|TR0|think it was so timely that we'd like to 
20101223010426.000|20101223010428.000|TR0|see you permanently stationed in North 
20101223010428.000|20101223010430.000|TR0|Korea to stave off these problems when 
20101223010430.000|20101223010433.000|TR0|they arise.
20101223010433.000|20101223010435.000|TR0|
20101223010435.000|20101223010437.000|TR0|Can you tell us a little bit about what 
20101223010437.000|20101223010440.000|TR0|the meetings were like? I mean what did 
20101223010440.000|20101223010442.000|TR0|the environment feel like?  Were you ever 
20101223010442.000|20101223010444.000|TR0|scared?  I mean how did that feel to you?
20101223010444.000|20101223010447.000|TR0|
20101223010447.000|20101223010449.000|TR0|RICHARDSON:  Well, they are very -- the 
20101223010449.000|20101223010451.000|TR0|North Koreans, we met with military 
20101223010451.000|20101223010453.000|TR0|officials, foreign ministry officials, the 
20101223010453.000|20101223010456.000|TR0|vice president of the country.  They all 
20101223010456.000|20101223010458.000|TR0|start out giving their speech, their 
20101223010458.000|20101223010500.000|TR0|propaganda speech, that the U.S. and South 
20101223010500.000|20101223010503.000|TR0|Korea, the sources of all evil, that 
20101223010503.000|20101223010505.000|TR0|they're -- they're not irresponsible 
20101223010505.000|20101223010507.000|TR0|people.  That they really didn't shoot 
20101223010507.000|20101223010510.000|TR0|that ship down.
20101223010510.000|20101223010512.000|TR0|
20101223010512.000|20101223010514.000|TR0|And after that is done, which is 
20101223010514.000|20101223010517.000|TR0|obligatory because they've got a lot of 
20101223010517.000|20101223010519.000|TR0|people from their audience listening to 
20101223010519.000|20101223010521.000|TR0|them, we get into serious stuff.  And in 
20101223010521.000|20101223010524.000|TR0|the past when I've been there, they keep 
20101223010524.000|20101223010526.000|TR0|this dogma up.  You get some concessions 
20101223010526.000|20101223010528.000|TR0|from them.  But this time they were 
20101223010528.000|20101223010531.000|TR0|listening.
20101223010531.000|20101223010533.000|TR0|
20101223010533.000|20101223010535.000|TR0|And they were in a mood I believe where 
20101223010535.000|20101223010537.000|TR0|they felt, look, we've gone too far into 
20101223010537.000|20101223010540.000|TR0|the precipice of being totally isolated 
20101223010540.000|20101223010542.000|TR0|and know one is talking to us, no one is 
20101223010542.000|20101223010544.000|TR0|giving us any credit.  Maybe we're going 
20101223010544.000|20101223010547.000|TR0|to change.  I think that's why they 
20101223010547.000|20101223010549.000|TR0|invited me there.       I didn't go there 
20101223010549.000|20101223010551.000|TR0|to vacation.  I was invited by their chief 
20101223010551.000|20101223010554.000|TR0|nuclear negotiator.  I didn't -- the Obama 
20101223010554.000|20101223010556.000|TR0|administration had asked me twice before 
20101223010556.000|20101223010558.000|TR0|not to go in the past when things were 
20101223010558.000|20101223010601.000|TR0|really, really hot.  And I didn't.  But 
20101223010601.000|20101223010603.000|TR0|this time they kind of said, OK, and I 
20101223010603.000|20101223010605.000|TR0|went. Totally unofficially.  I'm not 
20101223010605.000|20101223010608.000|TR0|representing them.  And I believe we did 
20101223010608.000|20101223010610.000|TR0|some good.
20101223010610.000|20101223010612.000|TR0|
20101223010612.000|20101223010615.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Let me ask you, you referred to 
20101223010615.000|20101223010617.000|TR0|the critical terms of the agreement.  You 
20101223010617.000|20101223010619.000|TR0|did get the North Koreans to agree to the 
20101223010619.000|20101223010621.000|TR0|IAEA inspectors and the sale of the rods 
20101223010621.000|20101223010624.000|TR0|to presumably South Korea and the hotline.
20101223010624.000|20101223010626.000|TR0|
20101223010626.000|20101223010628.000|TR0|What do you take away from that in terms 
20101223010628.000|20101223010631.000|TR0|of what North Korea will do with its 
20101223010631.000|20101223010633.000|TR0|nuclear program which has obviously been 
20101223010633.000|20101223010635.000|TR0|the major point of contention between them 
20101223010635.000|20101223010638.000|TR0|and certainly the United States?
20101223010638.000|20101223010640.000|TR0|
20101223010640.000|20101223010642.000|TR0|RICHARDSON:  This hotline which is so 
20101223010642.000|20101223010645.000|TR0|obviously needed between North and South 
20101223010645.000|20101223010647.000|TR0|Korea -- maybe a commission of the U.S. 
20101223010647.000|20101223010649.000|TR0|military commission, North Korea and South 
20101223010649.000|20101223010652.000|TR0|Korea -- to tour those disputed areas in 
20101223010652.000|20101223010654.000|TR0|the -- in the western sea, to just avert 
20101223010654.000|20101223010656.000|TR0|these kind of disasters.
20101223010656.000|20101223010658.000|TR0|
20101223010658.000|20101223010701.000|TR0|They're sending a signal that they're 
20101223010701.000|20101223010703.000|TR0|ready to reengage.  But I think the United 
20101223010703.000|20101223010705.000|TR0|States and other countries, we should say, 
20101223010705.000|20101223010708.000|TR0|all right, guys, let's verify before we 
20101223010708.000|20101223010710.000|TR0|trust you.  And -- but at least they're 
20101223010710.000|20101223010712.000|TR0|sending a signal that we're not going to 
20101223010712.000|20101223010715.000|TR0|be isolated much longer. We're ready to 
20101223010715.000|20101223010717.000|TR0|reengage.
20101223010717.000|20101223010719.000|TR0|
20101223010719.000|20101223010722.000|TR0|Now who's going to make the next move?  
20101223010722.000|20101223010724.000|TR0|And that's good because the tension has -- 
20101223010724.000|20101223010726.000|TR0|has decreased dramatically.  But it's 
20101223010726.000|20101223010729.000|TR0|still a tinder box.  And we've got to be 
20101223010729.000|20101223010731.000|TR0|guided by very careful diplomacy.
20101223010731.000|20101223010733.000|TR0|
20101223010733.000|20101223010736.000|TR0|PARKER:  Governor, can you explain what 
20101223010736.000|20101223010738.000|TR0|the hotline is and how that works exactly?
20101223010738.000|20101223010740.000|TR0|
20101223010740.000|20101223010742.000|TR0|RICHARDSON:  What it is, Kathleen, is 
20101223010742.000|20101223010745.000|TR0|simply a telephone system between the top 
20101223010745.000|20101223010747.000|TR0|leadership of North and South Korea.  They 
20101223010747.000|20101223010749.000|TR0|have actually put forth these proposals 
20101223010749.000|20101223010752.000|TR0|before but they never happen.
20101223010752.000|20101223010754.000|TR0|
20101223010754.000|20101223010756.000|TR0|It's sort of like the old hotline between 
20101223010756.000|20101223010759.000|TR0|us and the Russians in case there was some 
20101223010759.000|20101223010801.000|TR0|kind of nuclear altercation.  This is at 
20101223010801.000|20101223010803.000|TR0|the highest levels.  This is preventive 
20101223010803.000|20101223010806.000|TR0|measures that could be taken, a 
20101223010806.000|20101223010808.000|TR0|communications system that doesn't exist.
20101223010808.000|20101223010810.000|TR0|
20101223010810.000|20101223010813.000|TR0|You've got to understand that the United 
20101223010813.000|20101223010815.000|TR0|States and South Korea, we haven't been 
20101223010815.000|20101223010817.000|TR0|talking to the North Koreans, hardly at 
20101223010817.000|20101223010819.000|TR0|all for the past year, like zero.  And so 
20101223010819.000|20101223010822.000|TR0|you -- when you don't talk -- and 
20101223010822.000|20101223010824.000|TR0|especially our militaries, and you have 
20101223010824.000|20101223010826.000|TR0|these drills on both sides, the 
20101223010826.000|20101223010829.000|TR0|possibility of miscalculation is huge.
20101223010829.000|20101223010831.000|TR0|
20101223010831.000|20101223010833.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know you talk about the need 
20101223010833.000|20101223010836.000|TR0|for verification.  It is so critical 
20101223010836.000|20101223010838.000|TR0|because just a few weeks ago, of course, 
20101223010838.000|20101223010840.000|TR0|there was the revelation that North Korea 
20101223010840.000|20101223010843.000|TR0|had an establishment with thousands of 
20101223010843.000|20101223010845.000|TR0|centrifuges and the capacity to enrich 
20101223010845.000|20101223010847.000|TR0|uranium that frankly far surpassed 
20101223010847.000|20101223010850.000|TR0|anything anybody in the west had 
20101223010850.000|20101223010852.000|TR0|understood.       So there seems to be 
20101223010852.000|20101223010854.000|TR0|this sort of back and forth.  Where on the 
20101223010854.000|20101223010857.000|TR0|one hand they're saying look how advanced 
20101223010857.000|20101223010859.000|TR0|we are, now we'll invite you in to 
20101223010859.000|20101223010901.000|TR0|negotiate with you.  Clearly, they're 
20101223010901.000|20101223010903.000|TR0|playing these cards with some sort of 
20101223010903.000|20101223010906.000|TR0|strategy that we don't seem quite to have 
20101223010906.000|20101223010908.000|TR0|understood fully yet.
20101223010908.000|20101223010910.000|TR0|
20101223010910.000|20101223010913.000|TR0|RICHARDSON:  That's right, Eliot.  I mean, 
20101223010913.000|20101223010915.000|TR0|what -- their biggest card is their 
20101223010915.000|20101223010917.000|TR0|nuclear weapons.  I don't know how many 
20101223010917.000|20101223010920.000|TR0|they have. There are estimates anywhere 
20101223010920.000|20101223010922.000|TR0|between four and 10.
20101223010922.000|20101223010924.000|TR0|
20101223010924.000|20101223010927.000|TR0|Now why is it in our interest for them to 
20101223010927.000|20101223010929.000|TR0|be eliminated?  One, we want stability in 
20101223010929.000|20101223010931.000|TR0|that peninsula.  We have a close alliance 
20101223010931.000|20101223010934.000|TR0|with South Korea.  We have 27,000 American 
20101223010934.000|20101223010936.000|TR0|troops on the DMZ.
20101223010936.000|20101223010938.000|TR0|
20101223010938.000|20101223010940.000|TR0|We don't want that area to be a tinder 
20101223010940.000|20101223010943.000|TR0|box.  We've got to get China more engaged 
20101223010943.000|20101223010945.000|TR0|in putting pressure on North Korea.  But 
20101223010945.000|20101223010947.000|TR0|for their own reasons, they're not doing 
20101223010947.000|20101223010950.000|TR0|much.  So eventually, it's going to be the 
20101223010950.000|20101223010952.000|TR0|six countries negotiating with the North 
20101223010952.000|20101223010954.000|TR0|Koreans and they're not going to give up 
20101223010954.000|20101223010957.000|TR0|these nuclear weapons for free.
20101223010957.000|20101223010959.000|TR0|
20101223010959.000|20101223011001.000|TR0|They're going to want some kind of 
20101223011001.000|20101223011004.000|TR0|financial benefits like energy assistance, 
20101223011004.000|20101223011006.000|TR0|like the old Clinton agreement of nuclear 
20101223011006.000|20101223011008.000|TR0|reactors. Hopefully, they'll want more 
20101223011008.000|20101223011011.000|TR0|energy efficient systems.  They'll want 
20101223011011.000|20101223011013.000|TR0|food.  That grain.  They've got a lot of 
20101223011013.000|20101223011015.000|TR0|people hurting.  Some starving.
20101223011015.000|20101223011018.000|TR0|
20101223011018.000|20101223011020.000|TR0|They're going to need an end to sanctions. 
20101223011020.000|20101223011022.000|TR0| We have every conceivable sanction on 
20101223011022.000|20101223011024.000|TR0|North Korea.  Economic sanctions.  
20101223011024.000|20101223011027.000|TR0|Political sanctions.  So I think they want 
20101223011027.000|20101223011029.000|TR0|to get out under that, especially now that 
20101223011029.000|20101223011031.000|TR0|there's a leadership transition.  Doesn't 
20101223011031.000|20101223011034.000|TR0|mean we should trust them.  All I'm saying 
20101223011034.000|20101223011036.000|TR0|is there's got to be engagement, 
20101223011036.000|20101223011038.000|TR0|negotiation.
20101223011038.000|20101223011041.000|TR0|
20101223011041.000|20101223011043.000|TR0|I never have felt that our foreign policy 
20101223011043.000|20101223011045.000|TR0|is well served by isolating the Cubas, the 
20101223011045.000|20101223011048.000|TR0|Irans, and North Koreas.  Despite the fact 
20101223011048.000|20101223011050.000|TR0|we have differences.  I think you've got 
20101223011050.000|20101223011052.000|TR0|to negotiate.  Doesn't mean you're going 
20101223011052.000|20101223011055.000|TR0|to do what they want.  But keeping them 
20101223011055.000|20101223011057.000|TR0|isolated, hunker down, sanctioned, I don't 
20101223011057.000|20101223011059.000|TR0|think it's ever worked.
20101223011059.000|20101223011102.000|TR0|
20101223011102.000|20101223011104.000|TR0|And this is why I believe we need some 
20101223011104.000|20101223011106.000|TR0|kind of engagement with North Korea.  But 
20101223011106.000|20101223011108.000|TR0|it's got to be carefully done.  It's got 
20101223011108.000|20101223011111.000|TR0|to involve the six countries.  And it's 
20101223011111.000|20101223011113.000|TR0|got to be with verification.  With 
20101223011113.000|20101223011115.000|TR0|benchmarks.  But right now not talking, 
20101223011115.000|20101223011118.000|TR0|hoping they don't retaliate, that's not 
20101223011118.000|20101223011120.000|TR0|the way to go.
20101223011120.000|20101223011122.000|TR0|
20101223011122.000|20101223011125.000|TR0|But I think our policy has been firm.  
20101223011125.000|20101223011127.000|TR0|We're anchored with South Korea.  But 
20101223011127.000|20101223011129.000|TR0|maybe now that they gave us this opening, 
20101223011129.000|20101223011132.000|TR0|somebody should respond to them and say, 
20101223011132.000|20101223011134.000|TR0|OK, do those arms control measures you 
20101223011134.000|20101223011136.000|TR0|told Richardson, and then we'll talk and 
20101223011136.000|20101223011139.000|TR0|let's see where we go.
20101223011139.000|20101223011141.000|TR0|
20101223011141.000|20101223011143.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right, Governor Bill 
20101223011143.000|20101223011145.000|TR0|Richardson, fascinating conversation.
20101223011145.000|20101223011148.000|TR0|

20101223011204.000|20101223011206.000|TR0|to create this office and can it be fixed 
20101223011206.000|20101223011209.000|TR0|so that it works appropriately?

20101223011213.000|20101223011216.000|TR0|think it would have been better to stay 
20101223011216.000|20101223011218.000|TR0|with what we had.  But I do think it can 
20101223011218.000|20101223011220.000|TR0|work with the right people in the job.

20101223011451.000|20101223011453.000|TR0|take a look at a clip. Here's President 
20101223011453.000|20101223011455.000|TR0|Bush announcing the creation of the Office 
20101223011455.000|20101223011458.000|TR0|of the Director of National Intelligence.

20101223011505.000|20101223011507.000|TR0|GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE 
20101223011507.000|20101223011509.000|TR0|UNITED STATES:  Basing these authorities 
20101223011509.000|20101223011511.000|TR0|in a single official who reports directly 
20101223011511.000|20101223011514.000|TR0|to me will make our intelligence efforts 
20101223011514.000|20101223011516.000|TR0|better coordinated and more efficient and 
20101223011516.000|20101223011518.000|TR0|more effective.

20101223011521.000|20101223011523.000|TR0|And the new structure will help ensure 
20101223011523.000|20101223011525.000|TR0|greater information sharing among federal 
20101223011525.000|20101223011528.000|TR0|departments and agencies and also with

20101223011537.000|20101223011539.000|TR0|PARKER:  Now this office was created on 
20101223011539.000|20101223011542.000|TR0|the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission 
20101223011542.000|20101223011544.000|TR0|to solve one problem, information did not 
20101223011544.000|20101223011546.000|TR0|get where it needed to go, and nine years 
20101223011546.000|20101223011548.000|TR0|later, we seem to still have the problem.
20101223011548.000|20101223011551.000|TR0|
20101223011551.000|20101223011553.000|TR0|What do you think is going on here?
20101223011553.000|20101223011555.000|TR0|
20101223011555.000|20101223011558.000|TR0|WOOLSEY:  I'm not sure this is an 
20101223011558.000|20101223011600.000|TR0|information sharing problem in the sense 
20101223011600.000|20101223011602.000|TR0|of the CIA not talking enough to DIA and 
20101223011602.000|20101223011605.000|TR0|so forth.  I think this is more, really, 
20101223011605.000|20101223011607.000|TR0|kind of a public relations glitch.  
20101223011607.000|20101223011609.000|TR0|Somebody on Jim Clapper's staff should 
20101223011609.000|20101223011612.000|TR0|have told him in the morning that during 
20101223011612.000|20101223011614.000|TR0|the wee hours these arrests have been made 
20101223011614.000|20101223011616.000|TR0|in Britain and then he would have at least 
20101223011616.000|20101223011619.000|TR0|known about it.
20101223011619.000|20101223011621.000|TR0|
20101223011621.000|20101223011623.000|TR0|But he probably didn't have any 
20101223011623.000|20101223011626.000|TR0|operational role in working with the Brits 
20101223011626.000|20101223011628.000|TR0|on this.  I hope we were, as a government, 
20101223011628.000|20101223011630.000|TR0|helping them and worked closely with them. 
20101223011630.000|20101223011632.000|TR0| But we probably didn't know more 
20101223011632.000|20101223011635.000|TR0|something that the CIA would have been 
20101223011635.000|20101223011637.000|TR0|involved in.  So it looks bad that he 
20101223011637.000|20101223011639.000|TR0|didn't know about it.  But I don't think 
20101223011639.000|20101223011642.000|TR0|it's particularly a reflection of the 
20101223011642.000|20101223011644.000|TR0|substantive information sharing problem 
20101223011644.000|20101223011646.000|TR0|which preceded 9/11.
20101223011646.000|20101223011649.000|TR0|
20101223011649.000|20101223011651.000|TR0|SPITZER:  But clearly this is not his best 
20101223011651.000|20101223011653.000|TR0|day in the media.  But I guess the 
20101223011653.000|20101223011656.000|TR0|question I want to ask is, put this one 
20101223011656.000|20101223011658.000|TR0|incident aside. Is it symbolic or 
20101223011658.000|20101223011700.000|TR0|emblematic of a larger problem?  The 
20101223011700.000|20101223011703.000|TR0|position was created basically as an 
20101223011703.000|20101223011705.000|TR0|umbrella over 16 intensely powerful 
20101223011705.000|20101223011707.000|TR0|agencies.
20101223011707.000|20101223011710.000|TR0|
20101223011710.000|20101223011712.000|TR0|None of which really wanted to report to 
20101223011712.000|20101223011714.000|TR0|this new position, the director of 
20101223011714.000|20101223011716.000|TR0|National Intelligence.  Look at -- you 
20101223011716.000|20101223011719.000|TR0|know, look on the screen there.  You see 
20101223011719.000|20101223011721.000|TR0|all the various symbols of the agencies.  
20101223011721.000|20101223011723.000|TR0|Can it work?  In other words, is this 
20101223011723.000|20101223011726.000|TR0|merely one more layer of bureaucracy?
20101223011726.000|20101223011728.000|TR0|
20101223011728.000|20101223011730.000|TR0|When you're director of the CIA, you 
20101223011730.000|20101223011733.000|TR0|certainly didn't want to be sharing with 
20101223011733.000|20101223011735.000|TR0|some other bureaucracy.  Can this work in 
20101223011735.000|20101223011737.000|TR0|the long run?       WOOLSEY:  The job I 
20101223011737.000|20101223011740.000|TR0|had was called director of Central 
20101223011740.000|20101223011742.000|TR0|Intelligence because it was a combination 
20101223011742.000|20101223011744.000|TR0|essentially of the jobs that Leon Panetta 
20101223011744.000|20101223011747.000|TR0|and Jim Clapper have now and it was 
20101223011747.000|20101223011749.000|TR0|essentially split in two, so Jim Clapper 
20101223011749.000|20101223011751.000|TR0|is sort of a strong chairman of the board 
20101223011751.000|20101223011753.000|TR0|in a way.
20101223011753.000|20101223011756.000|TR0|
20101223011756.000|20101223011758.000|TR0|He's not an operator, whereas Panetta and 
20101223011758.000|20101223011800.000|TR0|the other agency heads -- they're only 
20101223011800.000|20101223011803.000|TR0|three or four major strong ones -- run 
20101223011803.000|20101223011805.000|TR0|intelligence operations.  I think this 
20101223011805.000|20101223011807.000|TR0|setup is not ideal.  Frankly, I like the 
20101223011807.000|20101223011810.000|TR0|earlier one better.  But I think this 
20101223011810.000|20101223011812.000|TR0|could work with the right people in the 
20101223011812.000|20101223011814.000|TR0|job.  And it seems to me that Clapper and 
20101223011814.000|20101223011817.000|TR0|Panetta are old pros.
20101223011817.000|20101223011819.000|TR0|
20101223011819.000|20101223011821.000|TR0|They've been around this world politics in 
20101223011821.000|20101223011824.000|TR0|Washington and government, and in 
20101223011824.000|20101223011826.000|TR0|Clapper's case, intelligence for many 
20101223011826.000|20101223011828.000|TR0|years.  And if the system can work, it 
20101223011828.000|20101223011831.000|TR0|would probably work with them.  And there 
20101223011831.000|20101223011833.000|TR0|is some layering and so forth.
20101223011833.000|20101223011835.000|TR0|
20101223011835.000|20101223011837.000|TR0|But I don't think that's what happened 
20101223011837.000|20101223011840.000|TR0|here.  I think what happened here is just 
20101223011840.000|20101223011842.000|TR0|that some staffer who had communications 
20101223011842.000|20101223011844.000|TR0|responsibility didn't mention this to him.
20101223011844.000|20101223011847.000|TR0|
20101223011847.000|20101223011849.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Look, having been an executive 
20101223011849.000|20101223011851.000|TR0|in large organizations where when I looked 
20101223011851.000|20101223011854.000|TR0|at a flow chart and I saw multiple 
20101223011854.000|20101223011856.000|TR0|organizations doing the same thing, I 
20101223011856.000|20101223011858.000|TR0|always said why, why are we duplicating?  
20101223011858.000|20101223011901.000|TR0|It will lead to confusion.  It will lead 
20101223011901.000|20101223011903.000|TR0|to a lack of information flow.
20101223011903.000|20101223011905.000|TR0|
20101223011905.000|20101223011908.000|TR0|I look at the CIA, the NSA, the DIA, and 
20101223011908.000|20101223011910.000|TR0|the acronyms go on and on.  Hundreds of 
20101223011910.000|20101223011912.000|TR0|billions of dollars we believe being spent 
20101223011912.000|20101223011914.000|TR0|on intelligence.  Clearly a critical 
20101223011914.000|20101223011917.000|TR0|mission for the nation to protect 
20101223011917.000|20101223011919.000|TR0|ourselves.
20101223011919.000|20101223011921.000|TR0|
20101223011921.000|20101223011924.000|TR0|But having said that when these multiple 
20101223011924.000|20101223011926.000|TR0|agencies are fighting over jurisdiction, 
20101223011926.000|20101223011928.000|TR0|wouldn't it have been wiser to concentrate 
20101223011928.000|20101223011931.000|TR0|them under fewer, rather than to once 
20101223011931.000|20101223011933.000|TR0|again expand and add another layer on top? 
20101223011933.000|20101223011935.000|TR0| It just doesn't seem to be working to me.
20101223011935.000|20101223011938.000|TR0|
20101223011938.000|20101223011940.000|TR0|WOOLSEY:  I think there was a 
20101223011940.000|20101223011942.000|TR0|jurisdictional feud to some extent between 
20101223011942.000|20101223011945.000|TR0|Admiral Blair when he was DNI and Leon 
20101223011945.000|20101223011947.000|TR0|Panetta is head of the CIA.  I think 
20101223011947.000|20101223011949.000|TR0|Admiral Blair wanted to be the final 
20101223011949.000|20101223011952.000|TR0|authority for appointing liaison officers 
20101223011952.000|20101223011954.000|TR0|country by country to deal with foreign 
20101223011954.000|20101223011956.000|TR0|intelligence services.
20101223011956.000|20101223011958.000|TR0|
20101223011958.000|20101223012001.000|TR0|Typically that's always been done in the 
20101223012001.000|20101223012003.000|TR0|past by the director of the CIA.  And that 
20101223012003.000|20101223012005.000|TR0|was preserved for Panetta.  Also the staff 
20101223012005.000|20101223012008.000|TR0|of the DNI has gotten to be quite large.  
20101223012008.000|20101223012010.000|TR0|It's well over 1,000 and I think people 
20101223012010.000|20101223012012.000|TR0|were thinking of it being dozens when this 
20101223012012.000|20101223012015.000|TR0|job was created because the DNI is sort of 
20101223012015.000|20101223012017.000|TR0|a strong chairman of the board for the 
20101223012017.000|20101223012019.000|TR0|whole community.
20101223012019.000|20101223012022.000|TR0|
20101223012022.000|20101223012024.000|TR0|And as I said, there are really only three 
20101223012024.000|20101223012026.000|TR0|or four that needs to pay much attention 
20101223012026.000|20101223012029.000|TR0|to.  Most of those agencies are quite 
20101223012029.000|20101223012031.000|TR0|small.  But it is an important job.  I 
20101223012031.000|20101223012033.000|TR0|think probably having such a large staff 
20101223012033.000|20101223012035.000|TR0|kind of gets in the way and generates 
20101223012035.000|20101223012038.000|TR0|sometimes conflicts between the DIA and 
20101223012038.000|20101223012040.000|TR0|DCIA that didn't occur before.
20101223012040.000|20101223012042.000|TR0|
20101223012042.000|20101223012045.000|TR0|PARKER:  Well, he -- you know, this is 
20101223012045.000|20101223012047.000|TR0|certainly a glitch, but he's the fifth 
20101223012047.000|20101223012049.000|TR0|director of National Intelligence in five 
20101223012049.000|20101223012052.000|TR0|years.  So when you say this thing can 
20101223012052.000|20101223012054.000|TR0|work if we have the right people, what is 
20101223012054.000|20101223012056.000|TR0|it -- what kind of right person do we need?
20101223012056.000|20101223012059.000|TR0|
20101223012059.000|20101223012101.000|TR0|Because clearly either we haven't had the 
20101223012101.000|20101223012103.000|TR0|right people or the job is too 
20101223012103.000|20101223012106.000|TR0|overwhelming or the turf skirmishing as 
20101223012106.000|20101223012108.000|TR0|such that nobody can really manage it.  
20101223012108.000|20101223012110.000|TR0|What do you think -- who are we looking 
20101223012110.000|20101223012113.000|TR0|for here?
20101223012113.000|20101223012115.000|TR0|
20101223012115.000|20101223012117.000|TR0|WOOLSEY:  Well, I think Jim has the right 
20101223012117.000|20101223012119.000|TR0|background when he was director of DIA in 
20101223012119.000|20101223012122.000|TR0|the early '90s when I was DCI.  He did a 
20101223012122.000|20101223012124.000|TR0|very good job.  Then he's headed up the 
20101223012124.000|20101223012126.000|TR0|Reconnaissance Mapping Agency.
20101223012126.000|20101223012129.000|TR0|
20101223012129.000|20101223012131.000|TR0|He's been an intelligence officer his 
20101223012131.000|20101223012133.000|TR0|whole career.  He's not partisan.  He's a 
20101223012133.000|20101223012136.000|TR0|straight shooter.  I think we're not going 
20101223012136.000|20101223012138.000|TR0|to do better than Jim Clapper in this job. 
20101223012138.000|20101223012140.000|TR0| And if it turns out I'm wrong, and this 
20101223012140.000|20101223012143.000|TR0|is not just a glitch, that it's an example 
20101223012143.000|20101223012145.000|TR0|of a breakdown across the board in 
20101223012145.000|20101223012147.000|TR0|communications, I think I'd have to say if 
20101223012147.000|20101223012150.000|TR0|Jim Clapper and Leon Panetta can't make 
20101223012150.000|20101223012152.000|TR0|this system work, then maybe we ought to 
20101223012152.000|20101223012154.000|TR0|rethink it because it can't really 
20101223012154.000|20101223012157.000|TR0|probably be made to work.
20101223012157.000|20101223012159.000|TR0|
20101223012159.000|20101223012201.000|TR0|Every time you have a reorganization, it 
20101223012201.000|20101223012203.000|TR0|takes years to get things kind of sorted 
20101223012203.000|20101223012206.000|TR0|out.  And most Congress -- people in 
20101223012206.000|20101223012208.000|TR0|Congress and in various commissions get 
20101223012208.000|20101223012210.000|TR0|put together, they always want to 
20101223012210.000|20101223012213.000|TR0|reorganize.  Because reorganization is one 
20101223012213.000|20101223012215.000|TR0|of the only things they can talk about.
20101223012215.000|20101223012217.000|TR0|
20101223012217.000|20101223012220.000|TR0|So getting the right people in the jobs, 
20101223012220.000|20101223012222.000|TR0|doing -- making some policy changes, often 
20101223012222.000|20101223012224.000|TR0|those are classified.  And you can't -- 
20101223012224.000|20101223012227.000|TR0|the only thing you can talk about and show 
20101223012227.000|20101223012229.000|TR0|you've done something is if you 
20101223012229.000|20101223012231.000|TR0|reorganize.  So I think you ought to be 
20101223012231.000|20101223012234.000|TR0|slow to reorganize.
20101223012234.000|20101223012236.000|TR0|
20101223012236.000|20101223012238.000|TR0|I'm not yet ready to throw in the towel on 
20101223012238.000|20101223012240.000|TR0|this new system even though I didn't 
20101223012240.000|20101223012243.000|TR0|really want it implemented in the first 
20101223012243.000|20101223012245.000|TR0|place.
20101223012245.000|20101223012247.000|TR0|
20101223012247.000|20101223012250.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right, Mr. Woolsey, before we 
20101223012250.000|20101223012252.000|TR0|let you go, I just want to clarify one 
20101223012252.000|20101223012254.000|TR0|point.  You said a couple of times that 
20101223012254.000|20101223012257.000|TR0|you think the system could work but that 
20101223012257.000|20101223012259.000|TR0|would suggest that you do not think it is 
20101223012259.000|20101223012301.000|TR0|currently working.
20101223012301.000|20101223012304.000|TR0|
20101223012304.000|20101223012306.000|TR0|WOOLSEY:  Well, the jury is still kind of 
20101223012306.000|20101223012308.000|TR0|out from my point of view.  I'm so 
20101223012308.000|20101223012311.000|TR0|reluctant to reorganize.  Yet again I'd 
20101223012311.000|20101223012313.000|TR0|like to see it work.  I think Jim Clapper 
20101223012313.000|20101223012315.000|TR0|and Leon Panetta are both fine 
20101223012315.000|20101223012318.000|TR0|individuals. I've known them both for 30 
20101223012318.000|20101223012320.000|TR0|years.  They're really very able.  And I 
20101223012320.000|20101223012322.000|TR0|think they may well be able to make it 
20101223012322.000|20101223012324.000|TR0|work.  I guess the way I'd put it is the 
20101223012324.000|20101223012327.000|TR0|jury's still out.
20101223012327.000|20101223012329.000|TR0|
20101223012329.000|20101223012331.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right, James Woolsey, thank 
20101223012331.000|20101223012334.000|TR0|you so much for joining us.
20101223012334.000|20101223012336.000|TR0|
20101223012336.000|20101223012338.000|TR0|WOOLSEY:  Thank you.  Good to be with you.
20101223012338.000|20101223012341.000|TR0|
20101223012341.000|20101223012343.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Thank you.
20101223012343.000|20101223012345.000|TR0|
20101223012345.000|20101223012348.000|TR0|PARKER:  Coming up, Americans have been 
20101223012348.000|20101223012350.000|TR0|amazed to see our government actually 
20101223012350.000|20101223012352.000|TR0|working for at least a couple of weeks but 
20101223012352.000|20101223012355.000|TR0|can this last?  We'll ask David Gergen.  
20101223012355.000|20101223012357.000|TR0|Don't go away.

20101223012404.000|20101223012406.000|TR0|DAVID GERGEN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER: 
20101223012406.000|20101223012408.000|TR0| He's a clutch player. He likes coming and 
20101223012408.000|20101223012411.000|TR0|scoring at the last minute.  And he enjoys 
20101223012411.000|20101223012413.000|TR0|that. He plays for that.  And, you know, 
20101223012413.000|20101223012415.000|TR0|some people are really good at rising to 
20101223012415.000|20101223012418.000|TR0|that occasion.  But I did feel 
20101223012418.000|20101223012420.000|TR0|particularly with his press conference 
20101223012420.000|20101223012422.000|TR0|today that he looked more presidential 
20101223012422.000|20101223012425.000|TR0|than we've seen him.

20101223012436.000|20101223012439.000|TR0|PARKER:  After a dismal few months, 
20101223012439.000|20101223012441.000|TR0|President Barack Obama is ending the year 
20101223012441.000|20101223012443.000|TR0|on a high note.  Congress pushed through a 
20101223012443.000|20101223012445.000|TR0|flurry of bills before the holiday recess, 
20101223012445.000|20101223012448.000|TR0|including "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and the 
20101223012448.000|20101223012450.000|TR0|START treaty.

20101223012452.000|20101223012455.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Earlier today the president held 
20101223012455.000|20101223012457.000|TR0|a press conference touting these successes 
20101223012457.000|20101223012459.000|TR0|and how Congress came together despite 
20101223012459.000|20101223012502.000|TR0|predictions of gridlock.

20101223012509.000|20101223012511.000|TR0|BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
20101223012511.000|20101223012513.000|TR0|STATES:  If there's any lesson to draw 
20101223012513.000|20101223012516.000|TR0|from these past few weeks, it's that we 
20101223012516.000|20101223012518.000|TR0|are not doomed to endless gridlock.  We've 
20101223012518.000|20101223012520.000|TR0|shown in the wake of the November 
20101223012520.000|20101223012522.000|TR0|elections that we have the capacity not 
20101223012522.000|20101223012525.000|TR0|only to make progress but to make progress 
20101223012525.000|20101223012527.000|TR0|together.
20101223012527.000|20101223012529.000|TR0|
20101223012529.000|20101223012532.000|TR0|And I'm not naive.  I know there will be 
20101223012532.000|20101223012534.000|TR0|tough fights in the months ahead.  But my 
20101223012534.000|20101223012536.000|TR0|hope heading into the New Year is that we 
20101223012536.000|20101223012539.000|TR0|can continue to heed the message of the 
20101223012539.000|20101223012541.000|TR0|American people and hold to a spirit of 
20101223012541.000|20101223012543.000|TR0|common purpose in 2011 and beyond.

20101223012550.000|20101223012553.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Joining us now to discuss 
20101223012553.000|20101223012555.000|TR0|whether the president has regained the 
20101223012555.000|20101223012557.000|TR0|momentum, David Gergen, former 
20101223012557.000|20101223012600.000|TR0|presidential adviser.
20101223012600.000|20101223012602.000|TR0|
20101223012602.000|20101223012604.000|TR0|Welcome, David.
20101223012604.000|20101223012606.000|TR0|
20101223012606.000|20101223012609.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Thank you.

20101223012611.000|20101223012613.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, I just got -- I don't 
20101223012613.000|20101223012616.000|TR0|believe in coincidences, David.  And I 
20101223012616.000|20101223012618.000|TR0|know you visited the White House recently. 
20101223012618.000|20101223012620.000|TR0|Gave them some of your wisdom.  Suddenly 
20101223012620.000|20101223012623.000|TR0|there's a flurry of successes, so is this 
20101223012623.000|20101223012625.000|TR0|all your magic?  And more importantly, are 
20101223012625.000|20101223012627.000|TR0|you going back as chief of staff to the 
20101223012627.000|20101223012630.000|TR0|president in the coming year?
20101223012630.000|20101223012632.000|TR0|
20101223012632.000|20101223012634.000|TR0|GERGEN:  Come on, Eliot, you know better 
20101223012634.000|20101223012637.000|TR0|than both those things. And this was -- 
20101223012637.000|20101223012639.000|TR0|the president and his team, his current 
20101223012639.000|20101223012641.000|TR0|team, deserve an awful lot of credit for 
20101223012641.000|20101223012643.000|TR0|this.  They did a -- I think they played 
20101223012643.000|20101223012646.000|TR0|it very smartly with this.  I think Harry 
20101223012646.000|20101223012648.000|TR0|Reid was smart.
20101223012648.000|20101223012650.000|TR0|
20101223012650.000|20101223012653.000|TR0|It does seem to me that he's found a new 
20101223012653.000|20101223012655.000|TR0|way of governing.  And with the end of the 
20101223012655.000|20101223012657.000|TR0|elections, he's no longer relying on going 
20101223012657.000|20101223012700.000|TR0|up to a Democratic caucus and getting 
20101223012700.000|20101223012702.000|TR0|Democratic victories from Nancy Pelosi and 
20101223012702.000|20101223012704.000|TR0|Harry Reid.
20101223012704.000|20101223012707.000|TR0|
20101223012707.000|20101223012709.000|TR0|Instead, what he did in each one of these 
20101223012709.000|20101223012711.000|TR0|three victories he got was he formed an 
20101223012711.000|20101223012714.000|TR0|alliance outside the Democratic caucus 
20101223012714.000|20101223012716.000|TR0|that really helped to bring public opinion 
20101223012716.000|20101223012718.000|TR0|his way and then sway votes in the 
20101223012718.000|20101223012721.000|TR0|Congress.
20101223012721.000|20101223012723.000|TR0|
20101223012723.000|20101223012725.000|TR0|On the big tax bill, he worked with the 
20101223012725.000|20101223012727.000|TR0|Republican leadership, got it done.  On 
20101223012727.000|20101223012730.000|TR0|"Don't Ask, Don't Tell," he had Secretary 
20101223012730.000|20101223012732.000|TR0|Gates, who is a very influential figure in 
20101223012732.000|20101223012734.000|TR0|Washington these days, along with the head 
20101223012734.000|20101223012737.000|TR0|of the Joint Chiefs, who lined up with 
20101223012737.000|20101223012739.000|TR0|him, they helped to really drive home the 
20101223012739.000|20101223012741.000|TR0|point that "Don't Ask, Don't Tell' repeal 
20101223012741.000|20101223012744.000|TR0|was sound policy.
20101223012744.000|20101223012746.000|TR0|
20101223012746.000|20101223012748.000|TR0|And then on this final one, on the START 
20101223012748.000|20101223012751.000|TR0|treaty, this really turned around when he 
20101223012751.000|20101223012753.000|TR0|brought in the former secretaries of 
20101223012753.000|20101223012755.000|TR0|state, Republicans, and that reversed the 
20101223012755.000|20101223012758.000|TR0|momentum.
20101223012758.000|20101223012800.000|TR0|
20101223012800.000|20101223012802.000|TR0|PARKER:  David, you know, it takes every 
20101223012802.000|20101223012805.000|TR0|president a year or two to kind of come 
20101223012805.000|20101223012807.000|TR0|into his own and sort of figure out how to 
20101223012807.000|20101223012809.000|TR0|do, how to do the job really.  Do you feel 
20101223012809.000|20101223012811.000|TR0|like this is partly Barack Obama kind of 
20101223012811.000|20101223012814.000|TR0|figuring out who he is and how he wants to 
20101223012814.000|20101223012816.000|TR0|operate?
20101223012816.000|20101223012818.000|TR0|
20101223012818.000|20101223012821.000|TR0|GERGEN:  That's an interesting insight.  I 
20101223012821.000|20101223012823.000|TR0|think yes, I think the experience has 
20101223012823.000|20101223012825.000|TR0|helped him.  We also know, Kathleen, as 
20101223012825.000|20101223012828.000|TR0|Richard Wolffe, who's written a recent 
20101223012828.000|20101223012830.000|TR0|biography, argues that he's a clutch 
20101223012830.000|20101223012832.000|TR0|player. He likes coming in and scoring at 
20101223012832.000|20101223012835.000|TR0|the last minute.  And he enjoys that.  He 
20101223012835.000|20101223012837.000|TR0|plays for that.  And you know some people 
20101223012837.000|20101223012839.000|TR0|are really good at rising to that occasion.
20101223012839.000|20101223012842.000|TR0|
20101223012842.000|20101223012844.000|TR0|SPITZER:  The distinction I would make -- 
20101223012844.000|20101223012846.000|TR0|and I agree with you, these are very nice 
20101223012846.000|20101223012848.000|TR0|victories for the White House, for the 
20101223012848.000|20101223012851.000|TR0|president. But I think there's a 
20101223012851.000|20101223012853.000|TR0|fundamental distinction between "Don't 
20101223012853.000|20101223012855.000|TR0|Ask, Don't Tell" and START, a social issue 
20101223012855.000|20101223012858.000|TR0|and a foreign policy issue, as opposed to 
20101223012858.000|20101223012900.000|TR0|the fiscal related issues that are waiting 
20101223012900.000|20101223012902.000|TR0|for him come January where he's going to 
20101223012902.000|20101223012905.000|TR0|be facing a very different, and I think, a 
20101223012905.000|20101223012907.000|TR0|more rigid Republican Party where there 
20101223012907.000|20101223012909.000|TR0|will be tougher issues, where there may 
20101223012909.000|20101223012912.000|TR0|not be as much give on either side.
20101223012912.000|20101223012914.000|TR0|
20101223012914.000|20101223012916.000|TR0|That I think is where the real tensions 
20101223012916.000|20101223012919.000|TR0|are going to emerge.
20101223012919.000|20101223012921.000|TR0|
20101223012921.000|20101223012923.000|TR0|GERGEN:  I think you're right.  This is -- 
20101223012923.000|20101223012926.000|TR0|the Republicans got a big victory here, 
20101223012926.000|20101223012928.000|TR0|too, in this -- they stopped that omnibus 
20101223012928.000|20101223012930.000|TR0|spending bill.  It does set up huge 
20101223012930.000|20101223012932.000|TR0|showdowns over taxes on two issues.  This 
20101223012932.000|20101223012935.000|TR0|continuing resolution they passed on the 
20101223012935.000|20101223012937.000|TR0|deficit.  It runs on the budget spending 
20101223012937.000|20101223012939.000|TR0|-- runs out in March.  It means they've 
20101223012939.000|20101223012942.000|TR0|got to have a new bill to fund the 
20101223012942.000|20101223012944.000|TR0|government.
20101223012944.000|20101223012946.000|TR0|
20101223012946.000|20101223012949.000|TR0|And secondly, as you know, Eliot, the 
20101223012949.000|20101223012951.000|TR0|government has kind of break through the 
20101223012951.000|20101223012953.000|TR0|ceiling on the national debt, and the 
20101223012953.000|20101223012956.000|TR0|Congress has got to vote to raise the debt 
20101223012956.000|20101223012958.000|TR0|ceiling.  Both of those give the 
20101223012958.000|20101223013000.000|TR0|Republicans a lot of leverage.  And I 
20101223013000.000|20101223013003.000|TR0|think we're going to have real showdowns 
20101223013003.000|20101223013005.000|TR0|February, March.

20101223013009.000|20101223013012.000|TR0|President Obama was asked about the tax 
20101223013012.000|20101223013014.000|TR0|cuts.  Let's take a quick listen.

20101223013026.000|20101223013028.000|TR0|And I've said that before.  And I'll 
20101223013028.000|20101223013030.000|TR0|probably say it again.  I don't think that 
20101223013030.000|20101223013033.000|TR0|over the long run we can afford a series 
20101223013033.000|20101223013035.000|TR0|of tax breaks for people who are doing 
20101223013035.000|20101223013037.000|TR0|very well and don't need it.

20101223013044.000|20101223013047.000|TR0|they will still be rich if those tax cuts

20101223013110.000|20101223013112.000|TR0|go on this budget.  He's going to have to 
20101223013112.000|20101223013114.000|TR0|look at Medicare.  He's going to have to

20101223013117.000|20101223013119.000|TR0|have to look at, frankly, at changes in 
20101223013119.000|20101223013121.000|TR0|taxes, which are going to put the squeeze 
20101223013121.000|20101223013124.000|TR0|not only on the more affluent, as I think 
20101223013124.000|20101223013126.000|TR0|we should, but I don't see how we get from 
20101223013126.000|20101223013128.000|TR0|here towards balance without increasing 
20101223013128.000|20101223013130.000|TR0|the cost to the middle class.

20101223013242.000|20101223013245.000|TR0|and he served two tours of duty in Iraq,

20101223013557.000|20101223013559.000|TR0|
20101223013559.000|20101223013601.000|TR0|PARKER:  Anthony, why do you think it took 
20101223013601.000|20101223013604.000|TR0|so long?
20101223013604.000|20101223013606.000|TR0|
20101223013606.000|20101223013608.000|TR0|WOODS:  You know, this was a challenging 
20101223013608.000|20101223013611.000|TR0|process the entire way. But I've been 
20101223013611.000|20101223013613.000|TR0|really proud to see, you know, that we've 
20101223013613.000|20101223013615.000|TR0|made this far eventually.  And it took a 
20101223013615.000|20101223013617.000|TR0|lot of work.  I was really excited to see 
20101223013617.000|20101223013620.000|TR0|the level of emphasis from Secretary 
20101223013620.000|20101223013622.000|TR0|Gates, Admiral Mullen, and then ultimately 
20101223013622.000|20101223013624.000|TR0|the president and really making this day 
20101223013624.000|20101223013627.000|TR0|happen.  It took a long time because 
20101223013627.000|20101223013629.000|TR0|there's always been very serious 
20101223013629.000|20101223013631.000|TR0|opposition to the idea of gays and 
20101223013631.000|20101223013634.000|TR0|lesbians able to serve and be treated 
20101223013634.000|20101223013636.000|TR0|equally in the military but we finally 
20101223013636.000|20101223013638.000|TR0|reached the day where that's closer.
20101223013638.000|20101223013641.000|TR0|
20101223013641.000|20101223013643.000|TR0|SPITZER:  In the years you were in 
20101223013643.000|20101223013645.000|TR0|service, did you personally sense or see 
20101223013645.000|20101223013648.000|TR0|discrimination?
20101223013648.000|20101223013650.000|TR0|
20101223013650.000|20101223013652.000|TR0|WOODS:  I did not.  And as I realized 
20101223013652.000|20101223013655.000|TR0|during my time in Iraq, having to lie 
20101223013655.000|20101223013657.000|TR0|about who you are is not something that's 
20101223013657.000|20101223013659.000|TR0|necessary to be successful on the 
20101223013659.000|20101223013701.000|TR0|battlefield.  And I realize the military 
20101223013701.000|20101223013704.000|TR0|is an extremely professional organization 
20101223013704.000|20101223013706.000|TR0|where I didn't see homophobia, I didn't 
20101223013706.000|20101223013708.000|TR0|see racism, I didn't see these sorts of 
20101223013708.000|20101223013711.000|TR0|things as an everyday occurrence, that 
20101223013711.000|20101223013713.000|TR0|were commonplace and it was something that 
20101223013713.000|20101223013715.000|TR0|we could easily overcome if it ever arose.
20101223013715.000|20101223013718.000|TR0|
20101223013718.000|20101223013720.000|TR0|PARKER:  One of the concerns, of course, 
20101223013720.000|20101223013722.000|TR0|has been the safety of gays and lesbians 
20101223013722.000|20101223013725.000|TR0|within that environment.  And so are you 
20101223013725.000|20101223013727.000|TR0|concerned at all that some people might 
20101223013727.000|20101223013729.000|TR0|retaliate out of anger or a lack of 
20101223013729.000|20101223013732.000|TR0|understanding?
20101223013732.000|20101223013734.000|TR0|
20101223013734.000|20101223013736.000|TR0|WOODS:  I certainly would caution folks to 
20101223013736.000|20101223013738.000|TR0|be smart about this transition period.  
20101223013738.000|20101223013741.000|TR0|But we have a military with the most 
20101223013741.000|20101223013743.000|TR0|amazing noncommissioned officers and 
20101223013743.000|20101223013745.000|TR0|officers who are extremely professional, 
20101223013745.000|20101223013748.000|TR0|extremely leadership oriented who can take 
20101223013748.000|20101223013750.000|TR0|care of this challenge and make sure that 
20101223013750.000|20101223013752.000|TR0|every service member is treated with 
20101223013752.000|20101223013755.000|TR0|respect and dignity.
20101223013755.000|20101223013757.000|TR0|
20101223013757.000|20101223013759.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, it seems to me that 
20101223013759.000|20101223013802.000|TR0|the military has been one of those 
20101223013802.000|20101223013804.000|TR0|remarkable institutions in our society 
20101223013804.000|20101223013806.000|TR0|that when it came to racial integration, 
20101223013806.000|20101223013809.000|TR0|sexual integration, in terms of men and 
20101223013809.000|20101223013811.000|TR0|women working together, and now 
20101223013811.000|20101223013813.000|TR0|integration in terms of sexual 
20101223013813.000|20101223013816.000|TR0|orientation, it has been a catalyst in 
20101223013816.000|20101223013818.000|TR0|such a critical way.  And I just think 
20101223013818.000|20101223013820.000|TR0|this is another remarkable moment for the 
20101223013820.000|20101223013822.000|TR0|military, proving it can take our society 
20101223013822.000|20101223013825.000|TR0|forward.  And I think you're a great 
20101223013825.000|20101223013827.000|TR0|example of that.  Are you planning to 
20101223013827.000|20101223013829.000|TR0|reenlist and join this effort?
20101223013829.000|20101223013832.000|TR0|
20101223013832.000|20101223013834.000|TR0|WOODS:  Yes, my partner Zach and I are 
20101223013834.000|20101223013836.000|TR0|starting to look over the options that are 
20101223013836.000|20101223013839.000|TR0|out there.  I'm really excited about 
20101223013839.000|20101223013841.000|TR0|rejoining the military.  And as soon as 
20101223013841.000|20101223013843.000|TR0|the Pentagon figures out exactly how 
20101223013843.000|20101223013846.000|TR0|that's going to work and how folks like 
20101223013846.000|20101223013848.000|TR0|myself who were discharged can rejoin, 
20101223013848.000|20101223013850.000|TR0|I'll be the first in line.
20101223013850.000|20101223013853.000|TR0|
20101223013853.000|20101223013855.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You said he will reenlist.  Has 
20101223013855.000|20101223013857.000|TR0|he been in the military as well?
20101223013857.000|20101223013900.000|TR0|
20101223013900.000|20101223013902.000|TR0|WOODS:  No, this is -- we talk over our 
20101223013902.000|20101223013904.000|TR0|options.  You know, when I left the 
20101223013904.000|20101223013906.000|TR0|military, I was a single person.  And now 
20101223013906.000|20101223013909.000|TR0|I have a family to think about.  And so 
20101223013909.000|20101223013911.000|TR0|I'm excited about rejoining the military 
20101223013911.000|20101223013913.000|TR0|with Zach at my side.
20101223013913.000|20101223013916.000|TR0|
20101223013916.000|20101223013918.000|TR0|PARKER:  There are parameters within the 
20101223013918.000|20101223013920.000|TR0|military that preclude the concerns a lot 
20101223013920.000|20101223013923.000|TR0|of people have.
20101223013923.000|20101223013925.000|TR0|
20101223013925.000|20101223013927.000|TR0|WOODS:  Exactly.
20101223013927.000|20101223013930.000|TR0|
20101223013930.000|20101223013932.000|TR0|PARKER:  Or at least would minimize them.
20101223013932.000|20101223013934.000|TR0|
20101223013934.000|20101223013937.000|TR0|WOODS:  I'd be the first to tell you that 
20101223013937.000|20101223013939.000|TR0|I am really glad that we're looking at 
20101223013939.000|20101223013941.000|TR0|changing policies just a way that we don't 
20101223013941.000|20101223013943.000|TR0|create special rules for gays and lesbians 
20101223013943.000|20101223013946.000|TR0|and special barracks and special 
20101223013946.000|20101223013948.000|TR0|bathrooms.  That we're going to start 
20101223013948.000|20101223013950.000|TR0|everyone the same.  And there are already 
20101223013950.000|20101223013953.000|TR0|rules on the books as you mentioned, 
20101223013953.000|20101223013955.000|TR0|Kathleen, that make it very, very clear 
20101223013955.000|20101223013957.000|TR0|that inappropriate behavior between any 
20101223013957.000|20101223014000.000|TR0|service member won't be tolerated and will 
20101223014000.000|20101223014002.000|TR0|be immediately rectified.  And so those 
20101223014002.000|20101223014004.000|TR0|same rules will go into effect and govern 
20101223014004.000|20101223014007.000|TR0|any inappropriate behavior between anyone.
20101223014007.000|20101223014009.000|TR0|
20101223014009.000|20101223014011.000|TR0|SPITZER:  It struck me that listening to 
20101223014011.000|20101223014014.000|TR0|the president today, it was one of the 
20101223014014.000|20101223014016.000|TR0|most powerful statements he's made in 
20101223014016.000|20101223014018.000|TR0|quite some time. People have been saying, 
20101223014018.000|20101223014021.000|TR0|has he lost his voice, has he lost his 
20101223014021.000|20101223014023.000|TR0|energy?
20101223014023.000|20101223014025.000|TR0|
20101223014025.000|20101223014027.000|TR0|WOODS:  Yes.
20101223014027.000|20101223014030.000|TR0|
20101223014030.000|20101223014032.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Today, I thought he had his 
20101223014032.000|20101223014034.000|TR0|cadence and the emotion was there.  It 
20101223014034.000|20101223014037.000|TR0|seemed as though this was an issue he 
20101223014037.000|20101223014039.000|TR0|deeply, deeply cared about.  Was that the 
20101223014039.000|20101223014041.000|TR0|emotive feel in the room today?
20101223014041.000|20101223014044.000|TR0|
20101223014044.000|20101223014046.000|TR0|WOODS:  It was really a feeling of 
20101223014046.000|20101223014048.000|TR0|jubilation.  And I felt it on both sides 
20101223014048.000|20101223014051.000|TR0|because the president and the vice 
20101223014051.000|20101223014053.000|TR0|president who were both there, you could 
20101223014053.000|20101223014055.000|TR0|tell they were very excited about making 
20101223014055.000|20101223014058.000|TR0|good on a campaign promise.  And the room 
20101223014058.000|20101223014100.000|TR0|was filled with a lot of folks who've been 
20101223014100.000|20101223014102.000|TR0|very strongly in support of repealing 
20101223014102.000|20101223014104.000|TR0|"Don't Ask, Don't Tell." And finally 
20101223014104.000|20101223014107.000|TR0|they're breathing this sigh of relief 
20101223014107.000|20101223014109.000|TR0|because many of them have been fighting 
20101223014109.000|20101223014111.000|TR0|this since before "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" 
20101223014111.000|20101223014114.000|TR0|was the law of the land.  They've been in 
20101223014114.000|20101223014116.000|TR0|this for decades now.  And so, finally, 
20101223014116.000|20101223014118.000|TR0|we've reached the promised land, so to 
20101223014118.000|20101223014121.000|TR0|speak.
20101223014121.000|20101223014123.000|TR0|
20101223014123.000|20101223014125.000|TR0|PARKER:  A lot of it is just familiarity, 
20101223014125.000|20101223014128.000|TR0|you know.  When you talk to people who 
20101223014128.000|20101223014130.000|TR0|have gays in their lives, they are much 
20101223014130.000|20101223014132.000|TR0|more accepting.  Those who haven't had 
20101223014132.000|20101223014135.000|TR0|that experience are, you know, they have a 
20101223014135.000|20101223014137.000|TR0|lack of understanding --
20101223014137.000|20101223014139.000|TR0|
20101223014139.000|20101223014142.000|TR0|WOODS:  That's true in the military.  You 
20101223014142.000|20101223014144.000|TR0|see the Pentagon's working group study 
20101223014144.000|20101223014146.000|TR0|also show that for those who have actually 
20101223014146.000|20101223014148.000|TR0|had a gay and lesbian service member in 
20101223014148.000|20101223014151.000|TR0|their unit who they knew of, 92 percent of 
20101223014151.000|20101223014153.000|TR0|them said it didn't affect their unit and 
20101223014153.000|20101223014155.000|TR0|they didn't have an issue with it.  And I 
20101223014155.000|20101223014158.000|TR0|think that's kind of the case going 
20101223014158.000|20101223014200.000|TR0|forward.
20101223014200.000|20101223014202.000|TR0|
20101223014202.000|20101223014205.000|TR0|SPITZER:  This is also an issue I have 
20101223014205.000|20101223014207.000|TR0|sensed over the years. Trying to be active 
20101223014207.000|20101223014209.000|TR0|in pushing forward the issue of same-sex 
20101223014209.000|20101223014212.000|TR0|rights here in New York State is 
20101223014212.000|20101223014214.000|TR0|generational.
20101223014214.000|20101223014216.000|TR0|
20101223014216.000|20101223014219.000|TR0|WOODS:  Yes.
20101223014219.000|20101223014221.000|TR0|
20101223014221.000|20101223014223.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Those below the age of let's say 
20101223014223.000|20101223014225.000|TR0|30 to 35 to a much greater degree just 
20101223014225.000|20101223014228.000|TR0|take it as a given.  Of course, one could 
20101223014228.000|20101223014230.000|TR0|not even consider discriminating, 
20101223014230.000|20101223014232.000|TR0|differentiating and view on people 
20101223014232.000|20101223014235.000|TR0|different based on sexual orientation.
20101223014235.000|20101223014237.000|TR0|
20101223014237.000|20101223014239.000|TR0|WOODS:  Exactly.
20101223014239.000|20101223014242.000|TR0|
20101223014242.000|20101223014244.000|TR0|SPITZER:  The older generation is not yet 
20101223014244.000|20101223014246.000|TR0|as acclimated to that. Now I wonder as the 
20101223014246.000|20101223014249.000|TR0|military goes forward and the younger 
20101223014249.000|20101223014251.000|TR0|generation begins to move up into the 
20101223014251.000|20101223014253.000|TR0|ranks of the most senior cadre of 
20101223014253.000|20101223014256.000|TR0|officers, I think it will become easier 
20101223014256.000|20101223014258.000|TR0|for everybody to be comfortable with this.
20101223014258.000|20101223014300.000|TR0|
20101223014300.000|20101223014303.000|TR0|WOODS:  I think that's absolutely right.  
20101223014303.000|20101223014305.000|TR0|I couldn't agree with you more.
20101223014305.000|20101223014307.000|TR0|
20101223014307.000|20101223014309.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Let's certainly hope that is the 
20101223014309.000|20101223014312.000|TR0|case.
20101223014312.000|20101223014314.000|TR0|
20101223014314.000|20101223014316.000|TR0|WOODS:  Absolutely.

20101223014321.000|20101223014323.000|TR0|you for your service.

20101223014326.000|20101223014328.000|TR0|WOODS:  Thank you so much.  Looking 
20101223014328.000|20101223014330.000|TR0|forward to serving again.
20101223014330.000|20101223014333.000|TR0|
20101223014333.000|20101223014335.000|TR0|PARKER:  We'll be right back.

20101223014340.000|20101223014342.000|TR0|
20101223014342.000|20101223014344.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Today, President Obama signed 
20101223014344.000|20101223014347.000|TR0|the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." The 
20101223014347.000|20101223014349.000|TR0|president made history today but it wasn't 
20101223014349.000|20101223014351.000|TR0|the first time the president had used his 
20101223014351.000|20101223014353.000|TR0|pen to change the military and in so doing 
20101223014353.000|20101223014356.000|TR0|change the country.
20101223014356.000|20101223014358.000|TR0|
20101223014358.000|20101223014400.000|TR0|In 1863, Abraham Lincoln began to recruit 
20101223014400.000|20101223014403.000|TR0|black soldiers into the Union Army.  Many 
20101223014403.000|20101223014405.000|TR0|Americans opposed it, but the civil war 
20101223014405.000|20101223014407.000|TR0|was still in doubt and Lincoln's 
20101223014407.000|20101223014410.000|TR0|reelection was up for grabs.  Lincoln 
20101223014410.000|20101223014412.000|TR0|needed victories and he needed soldiers.  
20101223014412.000|20101223014414.000|TR0|The addition of nearly 200,000 black 
20101223014414.000|20101223014417.000|TR0|troops helped give him both.  It also 
20101223014417.000|20101223014419.000|TR0|showed the nation that the courage and 
20101223014419.000|20101223014421.000|TR0|patriotism of black soldiers could not be 
20101223014421.000|20101223014424.000|TR0|doubted.
20101223014424.000|20101223014426.000|TR0|
20101223014426.000|20101223014428.000|TR0|PARKER:  African-Americans continued to 
20101223014428.000|20101223014430.000|TR0|serve in so-called colored units with 
20101223014430.000|20101223014433.000|TR0|white officers in charge.  But change was 
20101223014433.000|20101223014435.000|TR0|coming and once again, the military was 
20101223014435.000|20101223014437.000|TR0|the battleground.  Women had served as 
20101223014437.000|20101223014440.000|TR0|nurses and volunteers since Washington's 
20101223014440.000|20101223014442.000|TR0|day but after Pearl Harbor President 
20101223014442.000|20101223014444.000|TR0|Roosevelt established the Women's 
20101223014444.000|20101223014447.000|TR0|Auxiliary Army Corps or the WAACs.  
20101223014447.000|20101223014449.000|TR0|Suddenly, women were in uniform too.  And 
20101223014449.000|20101223014451.000|TR0|they didn't just sing and dance and make 
20101223014451.000|20101223014454.000|TR0|coffee but equal status was still a long 
20101223014454.000|20101223014456.000|TR0|way off.  So when World War II ended and 
20101223014456.000|20101223014458.000|TR0|women went home, they and the country 
20101223014458.000|20101223014501.000|TR0|would never be the same.
20101223014501.000|20101223014503.000|TR0|
20101223014503.000|20101223014505.000|TR0|SPITZER:  In 1948, President Harry Truman 
20101223014505.000|20101223014508.000|TR0|defied fierce opposition and ended 
20101223014508.000|20101223014510.000|TR0|segregation in the military.  Urging the 
20101223014510.000|20101223014512.000|TR0|president to action, a new movement was 
20101223014512.000|20101223014514.000|TR0|taking shape, the civil rights movement.  
20101223014514.000|20101223014517.000|TR0|And 16 years later, the Civil Rights Act 
20101223014517.000|20101223014519.000|TR0|became law.
20101223014519.000|20101223014521.000|TR0|
20101223014521.000|20101223014524.000|TR0|Today, with the end of "Don't Ask, Don't 
20101223014524.000|20101223014526.000|TR0|Tell," the next chapter has begun.  The 
20101223014526.000|20101223014528.000|TR0|military has always been the way we 
20101223014528.000|20101223014531.000|TR0|homogenize this country, which is why I 
20101223014531.000|20101223014533.000|TR0|believe in some sort of national service.
20101223014533.000|20101223014535.000|TR0|
20101223014535.000|20101223014538.000|TR0|PARKER:  Once more, we change the 
20101223014538.000|20101223014540.000|TR0|military.  It will surely change us.     
20101223014540.000|20101223014542.000|TR0|SPITZER:  When we come back, a deal was 
20101223014542.000|20101223014545.000|TR0|reached today on the 9/11 responders 
20101223014545.000|20101223014547.000|TR0|health bill.  We'll talk to a firefighter 
20101223014547.000|20101223014549.000|TR0|who was at Ground Zero and has since been 
20101223014549.000|20101223014551.000|TR0|diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  Stay with

20101223014603.000|20101223014605.000|TR0|That's why I think I took up this battle 
20101223014605.000|20101223014608.000|TR0|because I didn't want to sit at home and I 
20101223014608.000|20101223014610.000|TR0|didn't want to feel sorry for myself.  And 
20101223014610.000|20101223014612.000|TR0|I had made a promise to two very good men, 
20101223014612.000|20101223014615.000|TR0|firefighter John McNamara and firefighter 
20101223014615.000|20101223014617.000|TR0|Richie Mannetta (ph), who unfortunately 
20101223014617.000|20101223014619.000|TR0|passed.  I made a promise to them that 
20101223014619.000|20101223014622.000|TR0|their story would be told.

20101223014633.000|20101223014635.000|TR0|SPITZER:  In the final vote of the 111th 
20101223014635.000|20101223014638.000|TR0|Congress, the House passed a $4.2 billion 
20101223014638.000|20101223014640.000|TR0|health care bill to give free health care 
20101223014640.000|20101223014642.000|TR0|to 9/11 first responders and reopen the 
20101223014642.000|20101223014645.000|TR0|victim's compensation fund for five years. 
20101223014645.000|20101223014647.000|TR0| The legislation is named after NYPD 
20101223014647.000|20101223014649.000|TR0|Detective James Zadroga who died of a 
20101223014649.000|20101223014652.000|TR0|respiratory illness after 9/11.  Medical 
20101223014652.000|20101223014654.000|TR0|experts though are divided over the cause 
20101223014654.000|20101223014656.000|TR0|of Zadroga's death.  The medical examiner 
20101223014656.000|20101223014659.000|TR0|says it was related to drug use.  Other 
20101223014659.000|20101223014701.000|TR0|experts maintain it was because he inhaled 
20101223014701.000|20101223014703.000|TR0|the dust at Ground Zero after 9/11.

20101223014740.000|20101223014743.000|TR0|SPITZER:  You know, in the world of 
20101223014743.000|20101223014745.000|TR0|lawyering where people are suing to 
20101223014745.000|20101223014747.000|TR0|recover and be paid for injuries, this 
20101223014747.000|20101223014750.000|TR0|issue of causation is always really the 
20101223014750.000|20101223014752.000|TR0|pivot point.  So you as the doctor who 
20101223014752.000|20101223014754.000|TR0|would be called in as the expert witness, 
20101223014754.000|20101223014756.000|TR0|having viewed these studies, having 
20101223014756.000|20101223014759.000|TR0|thought about this, are you comfortable 
20101223014759.000|20101223014801.000|TR0|that there is, in fact, a causal link here 
20101223014801.000|20101223014803.000|TR0|so we can say yes, these workers really 
20101223014803.000|20101223014806.000|TR0|deserve this sort of payment?  It was not 
20101223014806.000|20101223014808.000|TR0|only an act of heroism but they also were 
20101223014808.000|20101223014810.000|TR0|injured by virtue of being there, inhaling 
20101223014810.000|20101223014813.000|TR0|all of this stuff, the dust and all the 
20101223014813.000|20101223014815.000|TR0|other things?
20101223014815.000|20101223014817.000|TR0|
20101223014817.000|20101223014820.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You start to see a trend that 
20101223014820.000|20101223014822.000|TR0|develops.  It is not cause and effect, 
20101223014822.000|20101223014824.000|TR0|Eliot, by any means.  But I think at some 
20101223014824.000|20101223014827.000|TR0|point in the medical establishment, we 
20101223014827.000|20101223014829.000|TR0|start to make educated guesses and 
20101223014829.000|20101223014831.000|TR0|recognize that these things tend to have 
20101223014831.000|20101223014833.000|TR0|harmful effects.  Some of the composites 
20101223014833.000|20101223014836.000|TR0|in that dust and smoke that you're seeing 
20101223014836.000|20101223014838.000|TR0|there can have an effect on the human 
20101223014838.000|20101223014840.000|TR0|body.  And it seems to get worse with 
20101223014840.000|20101223014843.000|TR0|dosing.
20101223014843.000|20101223014845.000|TR0|
20101223014845.000|20101223014847.000|TR0|PARKER:  In one of my former lives, I was 
20101223014847.000|20101223014850.000|TR0|a science writer and had a little bit of 
20101223014850.000|20101223014852.000|TR0|exposure to epidemiological studies.  And, 
20101223014852.000|20101223014854.000|TR0|of course, a good one would also conclude 
20101223014854.000|20101223014857.000|TR0|compounding factors what other exposures 
20101223014857.000|20101223014859.000|TR0|people might have had that could have led 
20101223014859.000|20101223014901.000|TR0|to cancer.  So did you have a chance to 
20101223014901.000|20101223014904.000|TR0|look at the studies that they did and did 
20101223014904.000|20101223014906.000|TR0|you feel confident that they had taken 
20101223014906.000|20101223014908.000|TR0|into consideration all those other factors 
20101223014908.000|20101223014911.000|TR0|that might have influenced these outcomes?
20101223014911.000|20101223014913.000|TR0|
20101223014913.000|20101223014915.000|TR0|GUPTA:  I'm glad you brought that up.  And 
20101223014915.000|20101223014917.000|TR0|yes, I mean, we literally looked through 
20101223014917.000|20101223014920.000|TR0|dozens of studies.  Over the last eight 
20101223014920.000|20101223014922.000|TR0|years, we've been reading these studies 
20101223014922.000|20101223014924.000|TR0|pretty continuously.
20101223014924.000|20101223014927.000|TR0|
20101223014927.000|20101223014929.000|TR0|Two things.  One is what was the level of 
20101223014929.000|20101223014931.000|TR0|these various diseases prior to 9/11?  And 
20101223014931.000|20101223014934.000|TR0|that same population of workers, rescue 
20101223014934.000|20101223014936.000|TR0|workers, first responders, what was the 
20101223014936.000|20101223014938.000|TR0|incidents of some of these problems? And 
20101223014938.000|20101223014941.000|TR0|it did go up.  And again, in the trends 
20101223014941.000|20101223014943.000|TR0|that I described, more dosing, more 
20101223014943.000|20101223014945.000|TR0|problems.  And the other thing, what was 
20101223014945.000|20101223014948.000|TR0|the incidents of these problems and people 
20101223014948.000|20101223014950.000|TR0|who lived in that particular area?  So the 
20101223014950.000|20101223014952.000|TR0|air quality overall in that particular 
20101223014952.000|20101223014955.000|TR0|area, that financial district, was it 
20101223014955.000|20101223014957.000|TR0|causing some problems already?  You can 
20101223014957.000|20101223014959.000|TR0|compare it to after 9/11.  You can compare 
20101223014959.000|20101223015001.000|TR0|it to before, and you can also compare it 
20101223015001.000|20101223015004.000|TR0|to different parts of the country, even 
20101223015004.000|20101223015006.000|TR0|different parts of the city of New York.  
20101223015006.000|20101223015008.000|TR0|And taking all of that in aggregate, there 
20101223015008.000|20101223015011.000|TR0|does seem to be some sort of influence 
20101223015011.000|20101223015013.000|TR0|here from, again, all those images you're 
20101223015013.000|20101223015015.000|TR0|just showing on people's health, 
20101223015015.000|20101223015018.000|TR0|specifically respiratory health.  I don't 
20101223015018.000|20101223015020.000|TR0|want to overreach, overextend here, but 
20101223015020.000|20101223015022.000|TR0|taken in aggregate, I think you can make 
20101223015022.000|20101223015025.000|TR0|that conclusion.
20101223015025.000|20101223015027.000|TR0|
20101223015027.000|20101223015029.000|TR0|PARKER:  OK, Sanjay.  Thank you so much 
20101223015029.000|20101223015032.000|TR0|for joining us.
20101223015032.000|20101223015034.000|TR0|
20101223015034.000|20101223015036.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Thanks for having me.  Appreciate 
20101223015036.000|20101223015038.000|TR0|it.
20101223015038.000|20101223015041.000|TR0|
20101223015041.000|20101223015043.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Thank you.
20101223015043.000|20101223015045.000|TR0|
20101223015045.000|20101223015048.000|TR0|Joining us now is one of the firefighters 
20101223015048.000|20101223015050.000|TR0|who led the effort to get this bill 
20101223015050.000|20101223015052.000|TR0|passed.  Kenny Specht was a New York City 
20101223015052.000|20101223015055.000|TR0|firefighter from 1996 to 2008.  He was at 
20101223015055.000|20101223015057.000|TR0|the World Trade Center on 9/11 and for 
20101223015057.000|20101223015059.000|TR0|weeks thereafter.  And he's been battling 
20101223015059.000|20101223015102.000|TR0|thyroid cancer since 2007.
20101223015102.000|20101223015104.000|TR0|
20101223015104.000|20101223015106.000|TR0|Thank you for being here.
20101223015106.000|20101223015109.000|TR0|
20101223015109.000|20101223015111.000|TR0|KENNY SPECHT, 9/11 FIRST-RESPONDER:  Oh, 
20101223015111.000|20101223015113.000|TR0|my pleasure, thanks for having me.
20101223015113.000|20101223015116.000|TR0|
20101223015116.000|20101223015118.000|TR0|PARKER:  Thanks for being with us.
20101223015118.000|20101223015120.000|TR0|
20101223015120.000|20101223015122.000|TR0|Well, let's just start with this.  You 
20101223015122.000|20101223015125.000|TR0|were at Ground Zero so you have a very 
20101223015125.000|20101223015127.000|TR0|personal connection to this.  And as Eliot 
20101223015127.000|20101223015129.000|TR0|said, you've been fighting thyroid cancer 
20101223015129.000|20101223015132.000|TR0|since 2007.  How you doing?
20101223015132.000|20101223015134.000|TR0|
20101223015134.000|20101223015136.000|TR0|SPECHT:  Well, if I can go on record first 
20101223015136.000|20101223015139.000|TR0|by saying that everybody in the New York 
20101223015139.000|20101223015141.000|TR0|City Fire Department today unfortunately 
20101223015141.000|20101223015143.000|TR0|watched what happened in Chicago.  Chicago 
20101223015143.000|20101223015146.000|TR0|lost two firefighters today.  And our 
20101223015146.000|20101223015148.000|TR0|thoughts and prayers go out to our 
20101223015148.000|20101223015150.000|TR0|brothers and sisters in the Chicago Fire 
20101223015150.000|20101223015153.000|TR0|Department.
20101223015153.000|20101223015155.000|TR0|
20101223015155.000|20101223015157.000|TR0|SPITZER:  As well they should.     SPECHT: 
20101223015157.000|20101223015159.000|TR0| I'm doing all right.  I'm doing well.  I 
20101223015159.000|20101223015202.000|TR0|have to be honest with you.  I'm happy for 
20101223015202.000|20101223015204.000|TR0|life.  I've had a rebirth really.  And I 
20101223015204.000|20101223015206.000|TR0|consider myself fortunate.  Very, very, 
20101223015206.000|20101223015209.000|TR0|very fortunate.  And really, that's why I 
20101223015209.000|20101223015211.000|TR0|think I took up this battle because I 
20101223015211.000|20101223015213.000|TR0|didn't want to sit at home and I didn't 
20101223015213.000|20101223015216.000|TR0|want to feel sorry for myself.  And I had 
20101223015216.000|20101223015218.000|TR0|made a promise to two very good men, 
20101223015218.000|20101223015220.000|TR0|firefighter John McNamara and firefighter 
20101223015220.000|20101223015223.000|TR0|Richie Mannetta (ph), who unfortunately 
20101223015223.000|20101223015225.000|TR0|passed.  I made a promise to them that 
20101223015225.000|20101223015227.000|TR0|their story would be told.  And it's my 
20101223015227.000|20101223015230.000|TR0|hope that today -- it's my hope today that 
20101223015230.000|20101223015232.000|TR0|their story was heard.
20101223015232.000|20101223015234.000|TR0|
20101223015234.000|20101223015237.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Well, first, I admire your 
20101223015237.000|20101223015239.000|TR0|fortitude and your spirit and congratulate 
20101223015239.000|20101223015241.000|TR0|you and thank you for your service.
20101223015241.000|20101223015243.000|TR0|
20101223015243.000|20101223015246.000|TR0|SPECHT:  Thank you, sir.
20101223015246.000|20101223015248.000|TR0|
20101223015248.000|20101223015250.000|TR0|SPITZER:  And also congratulate you on 
20101223015250.000|20101223015253.000|TR0|what you accomplished today, you and so 
20101223015253.000|20101223015255.000|TR0|many others.  How do you view the deal 
20101223015255.000|20101223015257.000|TR0|that has just been passed through the 
20101223015257.000|20101223015300.000|TR0|Congress?  Is this a big success?  Is this 
20101223015300.000|20101223015302.000|TR0|something you're proud of?
20101223015302.000|20101223015304.000|TR0|
20101223015304.000|20101223015307.000|TR0|SPECHT:  I think that we're very proud.  
20101223015307.000|20101223015309.000|TR0|It's a compromise.  I think that we were 
20101223015309.000|20101223015311.000|TR0|always willing to compromise.  You see, we 
20101223015311.000|20101223015314.000|TR0|always knew that the perfect could not 
20101223015314.000|20101223015316.000|TR0|stand in the way of the good.  The bill 
20101223015316.000|20101223015318.000|TR0|was necessary.  It provides finances for 
20101223015318.000|20101223015320.000|TR0|the medical monitoring programs.  These 
20101223015320.000|20101223015323.000|TR0|medical monitoring programs is so vitally 
20101223015323.000|20101223015325.000|TR0|important and like I said, today's victory 
20101223015325.000|20101223015327.000|TR0|hopefully will show that the medical 
20101223015327.000|20101223015330.000|TR0|monitoring programs will be a success.
20101223015330.000|20101223015332.000|TR0|
20101223015332.000|20101223015334.000|TR0|SPITZER:  We'll just get those numbers.  I 
20101223015334.000|20101223015337.000|TR0|think we can put something up on the 
20101223015337.000|20101223015339.000|TR0|screen here, so everybody will understand.
20101223015339.000|20101223015341.000|TR0|
20101223015341.000|20101223015344.000|TR0|This is a big deal.  This is $4.2 billion 
20101223015344.000|20101223015346.000|TR0|total.  $1.5 billion for health benefits 
20101223015346.000|20101223015348.000|TR0|and $2.7 billion for compensation.  So 
20101223015348.000|20101223015351.000|TR0|you're talking a lot of money going to the 
20101223015351.000|20101223015353.000|TR0|right purpose, which is to take care of 
20101223015353.000|20101223015355.000|TR0|the folks like you and others who 
20101223015355.000|20101223015358.000|TR0|responded on that tragic day.  Went right 
20101223015358.000|20101223015400.000|TR0|into the pit as it was called.  Many 
20101223015400.000|20101223015402.000|TR0|losing their lives.  People exposing 
20101223015402.000|20101223015404.000|TR0|themselves to toxins, to dangerous fumes, 
20101223015404.000|20101223015407.000|TR0|Digging desperately to go through the 
20101223015407.000|20101223015409.000|TR0|rubble to see who could be saved on that 
20101223015409.000|20101223015411.000|TR0|day when, you know, the world came to a 
20101223015411.000|20101223015414.000|TR0|standstill and some, like you, bravely 
20101223015414.000|20101223015416.000|TR0|acted.  And so, again, a great victory.  
20101223015416.000|20101223015418.000|TR0|Big money, but all deserved.  And we thank 
20101223015418.000|20101223015421.000|TR0|you for that fact.
20101223015421.000|20101223015423.000|TR0|
20101223015423.000|20101223015425.000|TR0|SPECHT:  Really, I thank you for having 
20101223015425.000|20101223015428.000|TR0|me.  And like I said, hopefully, hopefully 
20101223015428.000|20101223015430.000|TR0|we'll look back after the programs, after 
20101223015430.000|20101223015432.000|TR0|the five-year programs and say they were a 
20101223015432.000|20101223015435.000|TR0|success and that they really assisted 
20101223015435.000|20101223015437.000|TR0|those that needed it the most.
20101223015437.000|20101223015439.000|TR0|
20101223015439.000|20101223015442.000|TR0|PARKER:  The type of cancer you have, 
20101223015442.000|20101223015444.000|TR0|thyroid cancer, is also associated with 
20101223015444.000|20101223015446.000|TR0|chemical exposure?
20101223015446.000|20101223015448.000|TR0|
20101223015448.000|20101223015451.000|TR0|SPECHT:  Absolutely.  In a male, first and 
20101223015451.000|20101223015453.000|TR0|foremost, it would be family history.
20101223015453.000|20101223015455.000|TR0|
20101223015455.000|20101223015458.000|TR0|PARKER:  Right.
20101223015458.000|20101223015500.000|TR0|
20101223015500.000|20101223015502.000|TR0|SPECHT:  I don't have any.  And then 
20101223015502.000|20101223015505.000|TR0|second to that would be exposure to 
20101223015505.000|20101223015507.000|TR0|radiation or another chemical toxic agent. 
20101223015507.000|20101223015509.000|TR0| So I lost my thyroid completely.  Again, 
20101223015509.000|20101223015512.000|TR0|my cancer was found early and early 
20101223015512.000|20101223015514.000|TR0|detection is absolutely the most important 
20101223015514.000|20101223015516.000|TR0|part of recovery.  And that's why I 
20101223015516.000|20101223015519.000|TR0|consider myself fortunate.
20101223015519.000|20101223015521.000|TR0|
20101223015521.000|20101223015523.000|TR0|I didn't know that I was sick.  I was 
20101223015523.000|20101223015525.000|TR0|injured at a fire in Queens and I was 
20101223015525.000|20101223015528.000|TR0|transported to the hospital.  And during 
20101223015528.000|20101223015530.000|TR0|the medical exam for my injuries from the 
20101223015530.000|20101223015532.000|TR0|fire, the radiologist walked in and said 
20101223015532.000|20101223015535.000|TR0|that they had found a problem with my 
20101223015535.000|20101223015537.000|TR0|thyroid.  I had two cancerous tumors on 
20101223015537.000|20101223015539.000|TR0|it.  That's the reason I consider myself 
20101223015539.000|20101223015542.000|TR0|lucky because I didn't feel medically like 
20101223015542.000|20101223015544.000|TR0|there was something wrong.  And I didn't 
20101223015544.000|20101223015546.000|TR0|go to the doctor.  I was fortunate to have 
20101223015546.000|20101223015549.000|TR0|my cancer detected early enough.
20101223015549.000|20101223015551.000|TR0|
20101223015551.000|20101223015553.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Were you surprised when this 
20101223015553.000|20101223015556.000|TR0|issue first came up, when you went down to 
20101223015556.000|20101223015558.000|TR0|Capitol Hill, the vehemence of the 
20101223015558.000|20101223015600.000|TR0|opposition?  You had in New York after 
20101223015600.000|20101223015603.000|TR0|9/11, everybody, PD, the Fire Department, 
20101223015603.000|20101223015605.000|TR0|the first responders, you were the heroes. 
20101223015605.000|20101223015607.000|TR0| Everybody got that.  Somehow you listen 
20101223015607.000|20101223015609.000|TR0|to some of the voices in Congress the past 
20101223015609.000|20101223015612.000|TR0|couple of weeks and months, you got the 
20101223015612.000|20101223015614.000|TR0|sense that, wait a minute, they had a 
20101223015614.000|20101223015616.000|TR0|different imagery.  How do you make sense 
20101223015616.000|20101223015619.000|TR0|of that?
20101223015619.000|20101223015621.000|TR0|
20101223015621.000|20101223015623.000|TR0|SPECHT:  We got the sense that some 
20101223015623.000|20101223015626.000|TR0|elected officials in other parts of the 
20101223015626.000|20101223015628.000|TR0|country thought that this was a New York 
20101223015628.000|20101223015630.000|TR0|issue.  I'll always say that if we had 
20101223015630.000|20101223015633.000|TR0|sold this bill nine years ago, we'd have 
20101223015633.000|20101223015635.000|TR0|100 percent participation.  Unfortunately, 
20101223015635.000|20101223015637.000|TR0|the past nine years, we've had a 
20101223015637.000|20101223015640.000|TR0|recession.  We're now a country that's 
20101223015640.000|20101223015642.000|TR0|nine years at war.  And I respect those 
20101223015642.000|20101223015644.000|TR0|situations that this country has faced.  
20101223015644.000|20101223015646.000|TR0|And I think most 9/11 responders do.
20101223015646.000|20101223015649.000|TR0|
20101223015649.000|20101223015651.000|TR0|We understand that there was a place in 
20101223015651.000|20101223015653.000|TR0|line.  And we respected our place in line. 
20101223015653.000|20101223015656.000|TR0| However, we were getting worried 
20101223015656.000|20101223015658.000|TR0|certainly that we were down to the last 
20101223015658.000|20101223015700.000|TR0|seconds of the calendar year for this 
20101223015700.000|20101223015703.000|TR0|particular Congress.  And we didn't 
20101223015703.000|20101223015705.000|TR0|understand why.  We fought and we pushed a 
20101223015705.000|20101223015707.000|TR0|rock uphill.  As difficult as it was, I 
20101223015707.000|20101223015710.000|TR0|hope that this country sees today that 
20101223015710.000|20101223015712.000|TR0|what was accomplished by a select few 
20101223015712.000|20101223015714.000|TR0|people shows that if you do get involved 
20101223015714.000|20101223015717.000|TR0|in the politics, if you do get involved in 
20101223015717.000|20101223015719.000|TR0|the things that concern you, the battle 
20101223015719.000|20101223015721.000|TR0|will be difficult.  The hill -- the hill 
20101223015721.000|20101223015724.000|TR0|will be high.  But if you band together 
20101223015724.000|20101223015726.000|TR0|and remain together, the good will 
20101223015726.000|20101223015728.000|TR0|outweigh the bad.  You will win.  And 
20101223015728.000|20101223015730.000|TR0|today, hopefully -- hopefully, we see it 
20101223015730.000|20101223015733.000|TR0|as a win and those that are affected the 
20101223015733.000|20101223015735.000|TR0|most hopefully win.
20101223015735.000|20101223015737.000|TR0|
20101223015737.000|20101223015740.000|TR0|PARKER:  All right.  Kenny Specht, thank 
20101223015740.000|20101223015742.000|TR0|you so much for being with us.

20101223015749.000|20101223015751.000|TR0|SPITZER:  Congratulations.

20101223015803.000|20101223015805.000|TR0|JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  
20101223015805.000|20101223015807.000|TR0|Hello, I'm Joe Johns.  More of "PARKER 
20101223015807.000|20101223015810.000|TR0|SPITZER" in a moment.  First, the latest.
20101223015810.000|20101223015812.000|TR0|
20101223015812.000|20101223015814.000|TR0|WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is under 
20101223015814.000|20101223015817.000|TR0|house arrest and speaking out.  Assange 
20101223015817.000|20101223015819.000|TR0|told MSNBC that his critics including 
20101223015819.000|20101223015821.000|TR0|Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee are trying 
20101223015821.000|20101223015824.000|TR0|to make names for themselves by bashing 
20101223015824.000|20101223015826.000|TR0|him.  Assange is free on bail related to 
20101223015826.000|20101223015828.000|TR0|sexual allegation in Sweden.
20101223015828.000|20101223015831.000|TR0|
20101223015831.000|20101223015833.000|TR0|The parents of a gay Rutgers University 
20101223015833.000|20101223015835.000|TR0|student who committed suicide have 
20101223015835.000|20101223015838.000|TR0|notified the school they may sue.  As you 
20101223015838.000|20101223015840.000|TR0|may recall, Tyler Clementi jumped off the 
20101223015840.000|20101223015842.000|TR0|George Washington Bridge after his 
20101223015842.000|20101223015845.000|TR0|roommate and another student allegedly 
20101223015845.000|20101223015847.000|TR0|streamed online his sexual encounter with 
20101223015847.000|20101223015849.000|TR0|another man.  The university says it is 
20101223015849.000|20101223015851.000|TR0|not responsible for Clementi's suicide.
20101223015851.000|20101223015854.000|TR0|
20101223015854.000|20101223015856.000|TR0|And tonight on "360," the director of 
20101223015856.000|20101223015858.000|TR0|National Intelligence in the U.S. is not 
20101223015858.000|20101223015901.000|TR0|told that dozens of terror suspects were 
20101223015901.000|20101223015903.000|TR0|arrested in Britain.  How could this 
20101223015903.000|20101223015905.000|TR0|happen?  We're keeping them honest.
20101223015905.000|20101223015908.000|TR0|
20101223015908.000|20101223015910.000|TR0|That's the latest.  Now back to "PARKER
