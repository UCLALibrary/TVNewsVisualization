20101223141003.740|20101223141005.537|TR0|the election, Murkowski has 
20101223141005.537|20101223141007.333|TR0|become an increasingly

20101223141046.847|20101223141048.644|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Yes, well, 
20101223141048.644|20101223141050.440|TR0|I've been working on it now for 
20101223141050.440|20101223141052.236|TR0|about a year, from last December 
20101223141052.236|20101223141054.032|TR0|to now, on this huge problem of 
20101223141054.032|20101223141055.828|TR0|the increasing computerization 
20101223141055.828|20101223141057.624|TR0|of government under Bloomberg, 
20101223141057.624|20101223141059.420|TR0|but especially one particular 
20101223141059.420|20101223141101.216|TR0|project that ballooned from $60 
20101223141101.216|20101223141103.013|TR0|million to $700 million during 
20101223141103.013|20101223141104.809|TR0|his administration to

20101223141106.605|20101223141108.401|TR0|of the city government. And it's 
20101223141108.401|20101223141110.197|TR0|now exploded into the biggest 
20101223141110.197|20101223141111.993|TR0|scandal of the entire Bloomberg 
20101223141111.993|20101223141113.789|TR0|era, with - last week, as we 
20101223141113.789|20101223141115.585|TR0|reported here, there were - the 
20101223141115.585|20101223141117.382|TR0|FBI arrested six people, four of

20101223141119.178|20101223141120.974|TR0|the city. The following day, 
20101223141120.974|20101223141122.770|TR0|Bloomberg was forced to remove 
20101223141122.770|20101223141124.566|TR0|the director of the payroll 
20101223141124.566|20101223141126.362|TR0|administration. Investigations 
20101223141126.362|20101223141128.158|TR0|are continuing. There could be 
20101223141128.158|20101223141129.954|TR0|other arrests. A massive theft 
20101223141129.954|20101223141131.751|TR0|involving a huge criminal 
20101223141131.751|20101223141133.547|TR0|conspiracy to launder money and

20101223141140.731|20101223141142.527|TR0|And then, just this week, the

20101223141155.100|20101223141156.896|TR0|the city canceled another $40

20101223141158.693|20101223141200.489|TR0|about to get. And there are more

20101223141211.265|20101223141213.062|TR0|Thursday. This is after a number 
20101223141213.062|20101223141214.858|TR0|of the indictments had come down 
20101223141214.858|20101223141216.654|TR0|in Queens.

20101223141218.450|20101223141220.246|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, what 
20101223141220.246|20101223141222.042|TR0|happened is, the criminal group  
20101223141222.042|20101223141223.838|TR0|--  the alleged criminal group, 
20101223141223.838|20101223141225.634|TR0|because they've all pleaded "not 
20101223141225.634|20101223141227.431|TR0|guilty" at this point  --
20101223141227.431|20101223141229.227|TR0|
20101223141229.227|20101223141231.023|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: These are the 
20101223141231.023|20101223141232.819|TR0|consultants who were making the 
20101223141232.819|20101223141234.615|TR0|internet system more secure in 
20101223141234.615|20101223141236.411|TR0|the city?
20101223141236.411|20101223141238.207|TR0|
20101223141238.207|20101223141240.003|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, they 
20101223141240.003|20101223141241.800|TR0|were making the payroll system 
20101223141241.800|20101223141243.596|TR0|and the timekeeping system. They 
20101223141243.596|20101223141245.392|TR0|were supposed to make sure that 
20101223141245.392|20101223141247.188|TR0|the average city worker did not 
20101223141247.188|20101223141248.984|TR0|steal time on their time sheets, 
20101223141248.984|20101223141250.780|TR0|when they were doing all the 
20101223141250.780|20101223141252.576|TR0|stealing themselves, according 
20101223141252.576|20101223141254.372|TR0|to federal prosecutors.
20101223141254.372|20101223141256.169|TR0|
20101223141256.169|20101223141257.965|TR0|But after several people had 
20101223141257.965|20101223141259.761|TR0|been arrested and released on 
20101223141259.761|20101223141301.557|TR0|bail, the investigators began 
20101223141301.557|20101223141303.353|TR0|seizing bank accounts across the 
20101223141303.353|20101223141305.149|TR0|city, because they had many 
20101223141305.149|20101223141306.945|TR0|phantom companies. And they went 
20101223141306.945|20101223141308.741|TR0|to one bank where they seized a 
20101223141308.741|20101223141310.538|TR0|safe deposit box with - where 
20101223141310.538|20101223141312.334|TR0|they found $850,000 in cash in 
20101223141312.334|20101223141314.130|TR0|the safe deposit box. And as 
20101223141314.130|20101223141315.926|TR0|they were there in the bank, one 
20101223141315.926|20101223141317.722|TR0|of the people they had arrested 
20101223141317.722|20101223141319.518|TR0|the day before came to the bank 
20101223141319.518|20101223141321.314|TR0|with a dufflebag, apparently 
20101223141321.314|20101223141323.110|TR0|trying to take the cash before 
20101223141323.110|20101223141324.907|TR0|the prosecutors got to it, but 
20101223141324.907|20101223141326.703|TR0|the person got there a little 
20101223141326.703|20101223141328.499|TR0|late, as they had already seized 
20101223141328.499|20101223141330.295|TR0|the money.

20101223141400.829|20101223141402.625|TR0|responders who have been getting 
20101223141402.625|20101223141404.421|TR0|sick and who will get sick in 
20101223141404.421|20101223141406.217|TR0|the future as a result of the

20101223141408.014|20101223141409.810|TR0|Zero. Finally the Senate and the 
20101223141409.810|20101223141411.606|TR0|Congress have passed this bill.
20101223141411.606|20101223141413.402|TR0|
20101223141413.402|20101223141415.198|TR0|You know, one of the interesting 
20101223141415.198|20101223141416.994|TR0|things that I noted about this 
20101223141416.994|20101223141418.790|TR0|is the relative absence of some 
20101223141418.790|20101223141420.586|TR0|of the key figures who were 
20101223141420.586|20101223141422.383|TR0|involved at the time when the 
20101223141422.383|20101223141424.179|TR0|attacks happened. Rudy Giuliani, 
20101223141424.179|20101223141425.975|TR0|"America's Mayor," did not 
20101223141425.975|20101223141427.771|TR0|really come on the scene until 
20101223141427.771|20101223141429.567|TR0|the last couple of weeks, 
20101223141429.567|20101223141431.363|TR0|advocating for this bill, even 
20101223141431.363|20101223141433.159|TR0|though he was the incident 
20101223141433.159|20101223141434.955|TR0|commander whose decisions were 
20101223141434.955|20101223141436.752|TR0|the ones that, in essence, did 
20101223141436.752|20101223141438.548|TR0|not assure that these responders 
20101223141438.548|20101223141440.344|TR0|were protected properly. Then 
20101223141440.344|20101223141442.140|TR0|you have Governor - former 
20101223141442.140|20101223141443.936|TR0|Governor Pataki, who still has

20101223141447.528|20101223141449.324|TR0|anything about this bill. And, 
20101223141449.324|20101223141451.121|TR0|of course, former President Bush 
20101223141451.121|20101223141452.917|TR0|himself, who was seen at Ground 
20101223141452.917|20101223141454.713|TR0|Zero many times praising the 
20101223141454.713|20101223141456.509|TR0|responders, but who had said 
20101223141456.509|20101223141458.305|TR0|virtually nothing over the past 
20101223141458.305|20101223141500.101|TR0|couple of years in terms of 
20101223141500.101|20101223141501.897|TR0|urging his fellow Republicans to 
20101223141501.897|20101223141503.693|TR0|pass this bill.

20101223141505.490|20101223141507.286|TR0|But at least it got passed. And 
20101223141507.286|20101223141509.082|TR0|thanks to the work of people 
20101223141509.082|20101223141510.878|TR0|like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand 
20101223141510.878|20101223141512.674|TR0|and others who kept - and 
20101223141512.674|20101223141514.470|TR0|Congresswoman Maloney, who we've 
20101223141514.470|20101223141516.266|TR0|had on the show many times, and 
20101223141516.266|20101223141518.063|TR0|Congressman Nadler, they finally 
20101223141518.063|20101223141519.859|TR0|did pass this important bill.

20101223141552.189|20101223141553.985|TR0|Stapleton was concerned about

20101223141601.170|20101223141602.966|TR0|warned that a new French

20101223141604.762|20101223141606.558|TR0|could spread anti-biotech policy

20101223141729.180|20101223141730.976|TR0|Democracy Now! video stream, 
20101223141730.976|20101223141732.772|TR0|thanks so much for being with 
20101223141732.772|20101223141734.568|TR0|us. Talk about the significance 
20101223141734.568|20101223141736.364|TR0|of these documents leaked by 
20101223141736.364|20101223141738.160|TR0|WikiLeaks.

20101223141739.956|20101223141741.753|TR0|>> JEFFREY SMITH: Well, we've 
20101223141741.753|20101223141743.549|TR0|been saying for years that the 
20101223141743.549|20101223141745.345|TR0|United States government has 
20101223141745.345|20101223141747.141|TR0|joined at - is joined at the hip 
20101223141747.141|20101223141748.937|TR0|with Monsanto and pushing GMOs 
20101223141748.937|20101223141750.733|TR0|as part of Monsanto's agenda on 
20101223141750.733|20101223141752.529|TR0|the rest of the world. This lays 
20101223141752.529|20101223141754.325|TR0|bare the mechanics of that 
20101223141754.325|20101223141756.122|TR0|effort. We have Craig Stapleton, 
20101223141756.122|20101223141757.918|TR0|the former ambassador to France, 
20101223141757.918|20101223141759.714|TR0|specifically asking the U.S. 
20101223141759.714|20101223141801.510|TR0|government to retaliate and 
20101223141801.510|20101223141803.306|TR0|cause some harm throughout the 
20101223141803.306|20101223141805.102|TR0|European Union. And then, two 
20101223141805.102|20101223141806.898|TR0|years later, in 2009, we have a 
20101223141806.898|20101223141808.694|TR0|cable from the ambassador to 
20101223141808.694|20101223141810.491|TR0|Spain from the United States 
20101223141810.491|20101223141812.287|TR0|asking for intervention there, 
20101223141812.287|20101223141814.083|TR0|asking the government to help 
20101223141814.083|20101223141815.879|TR0|formulate a biotech strategy and 
20101223141815.879|20101223141817.675|TR0|support the government - members 
20101223141817.675|20101223141819.471|TR0|of the government in Spain that 
20101223141819.471|20101223141821.267|TR0|want to promote GMOs, as well. 
20101223141821.267|20101223141823.063|TR0|And here, they specifically 
20101223141823.063|20101223141824.860|TR0|indicate that they sat with the 
20101223141824.860|20101223141826.656|TR0|director of Monsanto for the 
20101223141826.656|20101223141828.452|TR0|region and got briefed by him 
20101223141828.452|20101223141830.248|TR0|about the politics of the region 
20101223141830.248|20101223141832.044|TR0|and created strategies with him 
20101223141832.044|20101223141833.840|TR0|to promote the GMO agenda.
20101223141833.840|20101223141835.636|TR0|
20101223141835.636|20101223141837.432|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Now, they 
20101223141837.432|20101223141839.229|TR0|apparently were especially 
20101223141839.229|20101223141841.025|TR0|interested in one Monsanto 
20101223141841.025|20101223141842.821|TR0|product, MON 810. Could you talk 
20101223141842.821|20101223141844.617|TR0|about that?
20101223141844.617|20101223141846.413|TR0|
20101223141846.413|20101223141848.209|TR0|>> JEFFREY SMITH: Yes. This is 
20101223141848.209|20101223141850.005|TR0|the first seed that was approved 
20101223141850.005|20101223141851.801|TR0|for widespread planting. You 
20101223141851.801|20101223141853.598|TR0|see, the biotech industry was 
20101223141853.598|20101223141855.394|TR0|concerned initially about the 
20101223141855.394|20101223141857.190|TR0|European Union accepting 
20101223141857.190|20101223141858.986|TR0|genetically modified foods. 
20101223141858.986|20101223141900.782|TR0|Although that had been approved 
20101223141900.782|20101223141902.578|TR0|for years by the commission, the 
20101223141902.578|20101223141904.374|TR0|food industry had rejected it 
20101223141904.374|20101223141906.171|TR0|because consumers were 
20101223141906.171|20101223141907.967|TR0|concerned. And so, there hasn't 
20101223141907.967|20101223141909.763|TR0|been a lot of food going to the 
20101223141909.763|20101223141911.559|TR0|European Union that's 
20101223141911.559|20101223141913.355|TR0|genetically modified.
20101223141913.355|20101223141915.151|TR0|
20101223141915.151|20101223141916.947|TR0|However, they had planned to 
20101223141916.947|20101223141918.743|TR0|allow the growing of genetically 
20101223141918.743|20101223141920.540|TR0|modified seeds. Now that MON 810 
20101223141920.540|20101223141922.336|TR0|has been allowed, individual 
20101223141922.336|20101223141924.132|TR0|countries have stepped forward 
20101223141924.132|20101223141925.928|TR0|to ban in. And so, in 2007, they 
20101223141925.928|20101223141927.724|TR0|were concerned about that, and 
20101223141927.724|20101223141929.520|TR0|so they were trying to create a 
20101223141929.520|20101223141931.316|TR0|strategy to force these 
20101223141931.316|20101223141933.112|TR0|countries to accept the first of 
20101223141933.112|20101223141934.909|TR0|the genetically modified seeds. 
20101223141934.909|20101223141936.705|TR0|Since then, there's been more 
20101223141936.705|20101223141938.501|TR0|evidence showing that this 
20101223141938.501|20101223141940.297|TR0|genetically modified corn 
20101223141940.297|20101223141942.093|TR0|damages mice and rats, etc., can 
20101223141942.093|20101223141943.889|TR0|cause reductions of fertility, 
20101223141943.889|20101223141945.685|TR0|smaller litter sizes, smaller 
20101223141945.685|20101223141947.481|TR0|offspring, immune responses, 
20101223141947.481|20101223141949.278|TR0|etc. And these have gone largely 
20101223141949.278|20101223141951.074|TR0|ignored by both the European 
20101223141951.074|20101223141952.870|TR0|Food Safety Authority and the 
20101223141952.870|20101223141954.666|TR0|United States FDA.

20101223141956.462|20101223141958.258|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Talk about these 
20101223141958.258|20101223142000.054|TR0|health effects. Jeffrey Smith, 
20101223142000.054|20101223142001.850|TR0|you wrote a fascinating 
20101223142001.850|20101223142003.647|TR0|"Anniversary of a Whistleblowing 
20101223142003.647|20101223142005.443|TR0|Hero" piece about a British 
20101223142005.443|20101223142007.239|TR0|scientist and about the 
20101223142007.239|20101223142009.035|TR0|repercussions he suffered. He 
20101223142009.035|20101223142010.831|TR0|was one of the biggest GMO 
20101223142010.831|20101223142012.627|TR0|advocates. And explain what 
20101223142012.627|20101223142014.423|TR0|happened and what he actually 
20101223142014.423|20101223142016.219|TR0|learned.
20101223142016.219|20101223142018.016|TR0|
20101223142018.016|20101223142019.812|TR0|>> JEFFREY SMITH: Well, Dr. 
20101223142019.812|20101223142021.608|TR0|Arpad Pusztai was actually 
20101223142021.608|20101223142023.404|TR0|working on a $3 million grant 
20101223142023.404|20101223142025.200|TR0|from the U.K. government to 
20101223142025.200|20101223142026.996|TR0|figure out how to test for the 
20101223142026.996|20101223142028.792|TR0|safety of GMOs. And what he 
20101223142028.792|20101223142030.588|TR0|discovered quite accidentally is 
20101223142030.588|20101223142032.385|TR0|that genetically modified 
20101223142032.385|20101223142034.181|TR0|organisms are inherently unsafe. 
20101223142034.181|20101223142035.977|TR0|Within 10 days, his supposedly 
20101223142035.977|20101223142037.773|TR0|harmless GMO potatoes caused 
20101223142037.773|20101223142039.569|TR0|massive damage to rats - smaller 
20101223142039.569|20101223142041.365|TR0|brains, livers and testicles, 
20101223142041.365|20101223142043.161|TR0|partial atrophy of the liver, 
20101223142043.161|20101223142044.957|TR0|damaged immune system, etc. And 
20101223142044.957|20101223142046.754|TR0|what he discovered was it was 
20101223142046.754|20101223142048.550|TR0|the process, the generic process 
20101223142048.550|20101223142050.346|TR0|of genetic engineering, that was 
20101223142050.346|20101223142052.142|TR0|likely the cause of the problem. 
20101223142052.142|20101223142053.938|TR0|He went public with his concerns 
20101223142053.938|20101223142055.734|TR0|and was a hero.
20101223142055.734|20101223142057.530|TR0|
20101223142057.530|20101223142059.326|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: But I think you 
20101223142059.326|20101223142101.123|TR0|have to - Jeffrey Smith, if you 
20101223142101.123|20101223142102.919|TR0|could explain this. This is very 
20101223142102.919|20101223142104.715|TR0|significant, because he was an 
20101223142104.715|20101223142106.511|TR0|expert on the protein that was - 
20101223142106.511|20101223142108.307|TR0|it's this kind of insecticide. 
20101223142108.307|20101223142110.103|TR0|And everyone thought, oh, that 
20101223142110.103|20101223142111.899|TR0|might be the thing that would 
20101223142111.899|20101223142113.695|TR0|hurt people. But he said, 
20101223142113.695|20101223142115.492|TR0|actually, it wasn't the thing 
20101223142115.492|20101223142117.288|TR0|that was injected into the - or 
20101223142117.288|20101223142119.084|TR0|however it works when you 
20101223142119.084|20101223142120.880|TR0|genetically modify a potato, 
20101223142120.880|20101223142122.676|TR0|when you put that chemical 
20101223142122.676|20101223142124.472|TR0|inside, the protein inside the 
20101223142124.472|20101223142126.268|TR0|potato - it wasn't that.
20101223142126.268|20101223142128.064|TR0|
20101223142128.064|20101223142129.861|TR0|>> JEFFREY SMITH: Exactly. You 
20101223142129.861|20101223142131.657|TR0|see, he was testing with rats 
20101223142131.657|20101223142133.453|TR0|that were eating the genetically 
20101223142133.453|20101223142135.249|TR0|modified potato, engineered to 
20101223142135.249|20101223142137.045|TR0|produce an insecticidal protein. 
20101223142137.045|20101223142138.841|TR0|But he also tested other groups 
20101223142138.841|20101223142140.637|TR0|of rats that were eating natural 
20101223142140.637|20101223142142.433|TR0|potatoes that were spiked with 
20101223142142.433|20101223142144.230|TR0|that same protein, and then a 
20101223142144.230|20101223142146.026|TR0|third group that was just eating 
20101223142146.026|20101223142147.822|TR0|natural potatoes without the 
20101223142147.822|20101223142149.618|TR0|insecticide. Only the group that 
20101223142149.618|20101223142151.414|TR0|ate the genetically engineered 
20101223142151.414|20101223142153.210|TR0|potato got these problems, not 
20101223142153.210|20101223142155.006|TR0|the group that was eating the 
20101223142155.006|20101223142156.802|TR0|potatoes along with the 
20101223142156.802|20101223142158.599|TR0|insecticide. So it clearly 
20101223142158.599|20101223142200.395|TR0|wasn't the insecticide; it was 
20101223142200.395|20101223142202.191|TR0|somehow the process of genetic 
20101223142202.191|20101223142203.987|TR0|engineering.
20101223142203.987|20101223142205.783|TR0|
20101223142205.783|20101223142207.579|TR0|Now, that process creates 
20101223142207.579|20101223142209.375|TR0|massive collateral damage inside 
20101223142209.375|20101223142211.171|TR0|the DNA of the plant. Hundreds 
20101223142211.171|20101223142212.968|TR0|and thousands of mutations can 
20101223142212.968|20101223142214.764|TR0|be formed. There could be 
20101223142214.764|20101223142216.560|TR0|hundreds or thousands of genes 
20101223142216.560|20101223142218.356|TR0|that are natural genes in the 
20101223142218.356|20101223142220.152|TR0|plant that change their levels 
20101223142220.152|20101223142221.948|TR0|of expression. For example, with 
20101223142221.948|20101223142223.744|TR0|MON 810 corn, they found that 
20101223142223.744|20101223142225.540|TR0|there was a gene that is 
20101223142225.540|20101223142227.337|TR0|normally silent that is switched 
20101223142227.337|20101223142229.133|TR0|on and now creates an allergen 
20101223142229.133|20101223142230.929|TR0|in corn. They found 43 different 
20101223142230.929|20101223142232.725|TR0|genes that were significantly 
20101223142232.725|20101223142234.521|TR0|up-regulated or down-regulated, 
20101223142234.521|20101223142236.317|TR0|meaning that there's massive 
20101223142236.317|20101223142238.113|TR0|changes in these crops and 
20101223142238.113|20101223142239.909|TR0|they're not being evaluated by 
20101223142239.909|20101223142241.706|TR0|the U.S. - by the FDA or any 
20101223142241.706|20101223142243.502|TR0|other regulatory authority 
20101223142243.502|20101223142245.298|TR0|around the world before being 
20101223142245.298|20101223142247.094|TR0|put onto the market.
20101223142247.094|20101223142248.890|TR0|
20101223142248.890|20101223142250.686|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Now, was there 
20101223142250.686|20101223142252.482|TR0|any indication from the cables 
20101223142252.482|20101223142254.279|TR0|or from your research that the 
20101223142254.279|20101223142256.075|TR0|pressure that Ambassador 
20101223142256.075|20101223142257.871|TR0|Stapleton and other U.S. 
20101223142257.871|20101223142259.667|TR0|officials were putting on the 
20101223142259.667|20101223142301.463|TR0|E.U. had the desired effect? 
20101223142301.463|20101223142303.259|TR0|Because obviously Ambassador 
20101223142303.259|20101223142305.055|TR0|Stapleton, or former Ambassador 
20101223142305.055|20101223142306.851|TR0|Stapleton, was not just any 
20101223142306.851|20101223142308.648|TR0|former ambassador, he was the 
20101223142308.648|20101223142310.444|TR0|former co-owner of the Texas 
20101223142310.444|20101223142312.240|TR0|Rangers with former President 
20101223142312.240|20101223142314.036|TR0|George W. Bush.
20101223142314.036|20101223142315.832|TR0|
20101223142315.832|20101223142317.628|TR0|>> JEFFREY SMITH: Well, we've 
20101223142317.628|20101223142319.424|TR0|seen a consistent effort by the 
20101223142319.424|20101223142321.220|TR0|U.S. to bully Europe. But, you 
20101223142321.220|20101223142323.017|TR0|see, European - the European 
20101223142323.017|20101223142324.813|TR0|mind on this is kind of divided. 
20101223142324.813|20101223142326.609|TR0|Some countries are clearly in 
20101223142326.609|20101223142328.405|TR0|the camp of precautionary 
20101223142328.405|20101223142330.201|TR0|principle and protecting 
20101223142330.201|20101223142331.997|TR0|interests for health. Others are 
20101223142331.997|20101223142333.793|TR0|basically moving in lockstep 
20101223142333.793|20101223142335.589|TR0|with the U.S. government and 
20101223142335.589|20101223142337.386|TR0|Monsanto. So it's a fiercely 
20101223142337.386|20101223142339.182|TR0|pitched battle on every front in 
20101223142339.182|20101223142340.978|TR0|Europe.
20101223142340.978|20101223142342.774|TR0|
20101223142342.774|20101223142344.570|TR0|A lot of the focus of the State 
20101223142344.570|20101223142346.366|TR0|Department has been on 
20101223142346.366|20101223142348.162|TR0|developing countries. They try 
20101223142348.162|20101223142349.958|TR0|and push GMOs into Africa. They 
20101223142349.958|20101223142351.755|TR0|deployed the Secretary of 
20101223142351.755|20101223142353.551|TR0|State's chief advisory - 
20101223142353.551|20101223142355.347|TR0|scientific adviser, Nina 
20101223142355.347|20101223142357.143|TR0|Fedoroff, to Australia and to 
20101223142357.143|20101223142358.939|TR0|India. They tried to engage the 
20101223142358.939|20101223142400.735|TR0|Indian government with a 
20101223142400.735|20101223142402.531|TR0|contract or a treaty that would 
20101223142402.531|20101223142404.327|TR0|allow their scientists to be 
20101223142404.327|20101223142406.124|TR0|trained in the U.S. So they've 
20101223142406.124|20101223142407.920|TR0|been working around the world to 
20101223142407.920|20101223142409.716|TR0|try and influence policy on 
20101223142409.716|20101223142411.512|TR0|every single continent. And in 
20101223142411.512|20101223142413.308|TR0|some cases, they're doing - 
20101223142413.308|20101223142415.104|TR0|they're actually winning, where 
20101223142415.104|20101223142416.900|TR0|they're overtaking the 
20101223142416.900|20101223142418.696|TR0|regulatory authorities and 
20101223142418.696|20101223142420.493|TR0|making it quite weak, like it is 
20101223142420.493|20101223142422.289|TR0|in the U.S. And in some cases in 
20101223142422.289|20101223142424.085|TR0|Europe now, there's more 
20101223142424.085|20101223142425.881|TR0|resistance than ever, now that 
20101223142425.881|20101223142427.677|TR0|it's "not in my backyard" 
20101223142427.677|20101223142429.473|TR0|politics, "no planting in my 
20101223142429.473|20101223142431.269|TR0|country" type of politics.

20101223142433.065|20101223142434.862|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Jeffrey Smith, 
20101223142434.862|20101223142436.658|TR0|can you compare the Obama 
20101223142436.658|20101223142438.454|TR0|administration on biotechnology 
20101223142438.454|20101223142440.250|TR0|with the Bush administration?
20101223142440.250|20101223142442.046|TR0|
20101223142442.046|20101223142443.842|TR0|>> JEFFREY SMITH: Unfortunately, 
20101223142443.842|20101223142445.638|TR0|we were hoping for a lot more 
20101223142445.638|20101223142447.434|TR0|success. President Obama, while 
20101223142447.434|20101223142449.231|TR0|he was campaigning here in Iowa, 
20101223142449.231|20101223142451.027|TR0|promised that he would require 
20101223142451.027|20101223142452.823|TR0|labeling of genetically modified 
20101223142452.823|20101223142454.619|TR0|crops. And since most Americans 
20101223142454.619|20101223142456.415|TR0|say they would avoid GMOs if 
20101223142456.415|20101223142458.211|TR0|labeled, that would have 
20101223142458.211|20101223142500.007|TR0|eliminated it from the food 
20101223142500.007|20101223142501.803|TR0|supply. But, you see, he and the 
20101223142501.803|20101223142503.600|TR0|FDA have been promoting the 
20101223142503.600|20101223142505.396|TR0|biotechnology. And 
20101223142505.396|20101223142507.192|TR0|unfortunately, the Obama 
20101223142507.192|20101223142508.988|TR0|administration has not been 
20101223142508.988|20101223142510.784|TR0|better than the Bush 
20101223142510.784|20101223142512.580|TR0|administration, possibly worse.
20101223142512.580|20101223142514.376|TR0|
20101223142514.376|20101223142516.172|TR0|For example, the person who was 
20101223142516.172|20101223142517.969|TR0|in charge of FDA policy in 1992, 
20101223142517.969|20101223142519.765|TR0|Monsanto's former attorney, 
20101223142519.765|20101223142521.561|TR0|Michael Taylor, he allowed GMOs 
20101223142521.561|20101223142523.357|TR0|on the market without any safety 
20101223142523.357|20101223142525.153|TR0|studies and without labeling, 
20101223142525.153|20101223142526.949|TR0|and the policy claimed that the 
20101223142526.949|20101223142528.745|TR0|agency was not aware of any 
20101223142528.745|20101223142530.541|TR0|information showing that GMOs 
20101223142530.541|20101223142532.338|TR0|were significantly different. 
20101223142532.338|20101223142534.134|TR0|Seven years later, because of a 
20101223142534.134|20101223142535.930|TR0|lawsuit, 44,000 secret internal 
20101223142535.930|20101223142537.726|TR0|FDA memos revealed that that 
20101223142537.726|20101223142539.522|TR0|policy was a lie. Not only were 
20101223142539.522|20101223142541.318|TR0|the scientists at the FDA aware 
20101223142541.318|20101223142543.114|TR0|that GMOs were different, they 
20101223142543.114|20101223142544.910|TR0|had warned repeatedly that they 
20101223142544.910|20101223142546.707|TR0|might create allergies, toxins, 
20101223142546.707|20101223142548.503|TR0|new diseases and nutritional 
20101223142548.503|20101223142550.299|TR0|problems. But they were ignored, 
20101223142550.299|20101223142552.095|TR0|and their warnings were even 
20101223142552.095|20101223142553.891|TR0|denied, and the policy went 
20101223142553.891|20101223142555.687|TR0|forth allowing the deployment 
20101223142555.687|20101223142557.483|TR0|GMOs into the food supply with 
20101223142557.483|20101223142559.279|TR0|virtually no safety studies. 
20101223142559.279|20101223142601.076|TR0|That person in charge is now the 
20101223142601.076|20101223142602.872|TR0|U.S. food safety czar in the 
20101223142602.872|20101223142604.668|TR0|Obama administration.
20101223142604.668|20101223142606.464|TR0|
20101223142606.464|20101223142608.260|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And what is 
20101223142608.260|20101223142610.056|TR0|your general assessment of the 
20101223142610.056|20101223142611.852|TR0|sweeping reform that the Obama 
20101223142611.852|20101223142613.648|TR0|administration pushed through of 
20101223142613.648|20101223142615.445|TR0|the FDA, considered one of the 
20101223142615.445|20101223142617.241|TR0|biggest reforms of that agency 
20101223142617.241|20101223142619.037|TR0|in decades? Your assessment of 
20101223142619.037|20101223142620.833|TR0|it?
20101223142620.833|20101223142622.629|TR0|
20101223142622.629|20101223142624.425|TR0|>> JEFFREY SMITH: Well, if the 
20101223142624.425|20101223142626.221|TR0|FDA were absolutely dedicated to 
20101223142626.221|20101223142628.017|TR0|protecting public health, giving 
20101223142628.017|20101223142629.814|TR0|them more power makes sense. But 
20101223142629.814|20101223142631.610|TR0|investigation after 
20101223142631.610|20101223142633.406|TR0|investigation for years, it 
20101223142633.406|20101223142635.202|TR0|turns out that they often serve 
20101223142635.202|20101223142636.998|TR0|their, quote, "clients," which 
20101223142636.998|20101223142638.794|TR0|is industry. Even one-third of 
20101223142638.794|20101223142640.590|TR0|their own surveyed members in 
20101223142640.590|20101223142642.387|TR0|September revealed that they 
20101223142642.387|20101223142644.183|TR0|believe that corporate and 
20101223142644.183|20101223142645.979|TR0|special interests really 
20101223142645.979|20101223142647.775|TR0|dictates policy in the area of 
20101223142647.775|20101223142649.571|TR0|public health. So, my opinion 
20101223142649.571|20101223142651.367|TR0|is, giving them more power 
20101223142651.367|20101223142653.163|TR0|without first eliminating that 
20101223142653.163|20101223142654.959|TR0|bias towards corporations is a 
20101223142654.959|20101223142656.756|TR0|dangerous formula. In fact, they 
20101223142656.756|20101223142658.552|TR0|are officially mandated with 
20101223142658.552|20101223142700.348|TR0|promoting the biotech industry, 
20101223142700.348|20101223142702.144|TR0|which is obviously a conflict of 
20101223142702.144|20101223142703.940|TR0|interest.
20101223142703.940|20101223142705.736|TR0|
20101223142705.736|20101223142707.532|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I know both Eric 
20101223142707.532|20101223142709.328|TR0|Schlosser and also Michael 
20101223142709.328|20101223142711.125|TR0|Pollan have hailed the food 
20101223142711.125|20101223142712.921|TR0|safety legislation, but on the 
20101223142712.921|20101223142714.717|TR0|issue of talking to the State 
20101223142714.717|20101223142716.513|TR0|Department and what they're 
20101223142716.513|20101223142718.309|TR0|pushing abroad, I want to just 
20101223142718.309|20101223142720.105|TR0|say we did call the State 
20101223142720.105|20101223142721.901|TR0|Department and did not get a 
20101223142721.901|20101223142723.697|TR0|response. We wanted them to come 
20101223142723.697|20101223142725.494|TR0|on today's broadcast.
20101223142725.494|20101223142727.290|TR0|
20101223142727.290|20101223142729.086|TR0|Finally, Agriculture Secretary 
20101223142729.086|20101223142730.882|TR0|Tom Vilsack, Jeffrey Smith, your 
20101223142730.882|20101223142732.678|TR0|assessment?
20101223142732.678|20101223142734.474|TR0|
20101223142734.474|20101223142736.270|TR0|>> JEFFREY SMITH: Well, he was 
20101223142736.270|20101223142738.066|TR0|our governor here in Iowa, and 
20101223142738.066|20101223142739.863|TR0|he was the biotech governor of 
20101223142739.863|20101223142741.659|TR0|the year in 2001. And 
20101223142741.659|20101223142743.455|TR0|unfortunately, he's been 
20101223142743.455|20101223142745.251|TR0|following that course of action 
20101223142745.251|20101223142747.047|TR0|since he has been put in office. 
20101223142747.047|20101223142748.843|TR0|They released today the 
20101223142748.843|20101223142750.639|TR0|environmental impact statement 
20101223142750.639|20101223142752.435|TR0|for alfalfa, where they ignore 
20101223142752.435|20101223142754.232|TR0|their own data regarding the 
20101223142754.232|20101223142756.028|TR0|increase of pesticides because 
20101223142756.028|20101223142757.824|TR0|of GMOs. They ignore the data of 
20101223142757.824|20101223142759.620|TR0|their own scientists and other 
20101223142759.620|20101223142801.416|TR0|scientists, which show the use 
20101223142801.416|20101223142803.212|TR0|of Roundup, which will be 
20101223142803.212|20101223142805.008|TR0|promoted through this Roundup 
20101223142805.008|20101223142806.804|TR0|Ready alfalfa, is actually very 
20101223142806.804|20101223142808.601|TR0|toxic both for the environment 
20101223142808.601|20101223142810.397|TR0|and for human health. And so, 
20101223142810.397|20101223142812.193|TR0|he, as well as many others of 
20101223142812.193|20101223142813.989|TR0|the Obama administration, have 
20101223142813.989|20101223142815.785|TR0|been taken essentially from the 
20101223142815.785|20101223142817.581|TR0|biotech ranks and are now 
20101223142817.581|20101223142819.377|TR0|calling the shots there. And I'm 
20101223142819.377|20101223142821.173|TR0|very disappointed.
20101223142821.173|20101223142822.970|TR0|
20101223142822.970|20101223142824.766|TR0|There was some indication in the 
20101223142824.766|20101223142826.562|TR0|EIS, however, for the alfalfa 
20101223142826.562|20101223142828.358|TR0|that he might take into 
20101223142828.358|20101223142830.154|TR0|consideration concerns about 
20101223142830.154|20101223142831.950|TR0|contamination, which we all know 
20101223142831.950|20101223142833.746|TR0|is permanent, where the 
20101223142833.746|20101223142835.542|TR0|self-propagating genetic 
20101223142835.542|20101223142837.339|TR0|pollution of genetically 
20101223142837.339|20101223142839.135|TR0|modified foods can outlast the 
20101223142839.135|20101223142840.931|TR0|effects of global warming and 
20101223142840.931|20101223142842.727|TR0|nuclear waste. It's being 
20101223142842.727|20101223142844.523|TR0|released now without - with very 
20101223142844.523|20101223142846.319|TR0|little concern. Finally, we see 
20101223142846.319|20101223142848.115|TR0|some ray of light, where they're 
20101223142848.115|20101223142849.911|TR0|actually paying attention, but 
20101223142849.911|20101223142851.708|TR0|it's not enough. It's not based 
20101223142851.708|20101223142853.504|TR0|really on science.
20101223142853.504|20101223142855.300|TR0|
20101223142855.300|20101223142857.096|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We're going to 
20101223142857.096|20101223142858.892|TR0|leave it there, but we will 
20101223142858.892|20101223142900.688|TR0|certainly continue to follow 
20101223142900.688|20101223142902.484|TR0|this issue, Jeffrey Smith, it's

20101223142947.387|20101223142949.184|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: We turn now to 
20101223142949.184|20101223142950.980|TR0|the latest developments in the 
20101223142950.980|20101223142952.776|TR0|FBI's widening targeting of 
20101223142952.776|20101223142954.572|TR0|antiwar and Palestinian 
20101223142954.572|20101223142956.368|TR0|solidarity activists. In late 
20101223142956.368|20101223142958.164|TR0|September, FBI agents raided the 
20101223142958.164|20101223142959.960|TR0|homes of activists in 
20101223142959.960|20101223143001.756|TR0|Minneapolis and Chicago. They 
20101223143001.756|20101223143003.553|TR0|seized phones, computers, 
20101223143003.553|20101223143005.349|TR0|documents and other personal 
20101223143005.349|20101223143007.145|TR0|belongings. Subpoenas to appear 
20101223143007.145|20101223143008.941|TR0|before a grand jury were served 
20101223143008.941|20101223143010.737|TR0|on 13 people but later withdrawn 
20101223143010.737|20101223143012.533|TR0|when the activists asserted 
20101223143012.533|20101223143014.329|TR0|their right to remain silent.
20101223143014.329|20101223143016.126|TR0|
20101223143016.126|20101223143017.922|TR0|But earlier this month, 
20101223143017.922|20101223143019.718|TR0|subpoenas were reissued against 
20101223143019.718|20101223143021.514|TR0|three of those targeted in the 
20101223143021.514|20101223143023.310|TR0|raids. And just this week, a new 
20101223143023.310|20101223143025.106|TR0|subpoena was delivered to a 
20101223143025.106|20101223143026.902|TR0|Chicago-based activist and 
20101223143026.902|20101223143028.698|TR0|journalist involved in 
20101223143028.698|20101223143030.495|TR0|Palestinian solidarity work - at 
20101223143030.495|20101223143032.291|TR0|least the 23rd person subpoenaed 
20101223143032.291|20101223143034.087|TR0|since September.

20101223143035.883|20101223143037.679|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: All those 
20101223143037.679|20101223143039.475|TR0|subpoenaed have been involved 
20101223143039.475|20101223143041.271|TR0|with antiwar activism that's 
20101223143041.271|20101223143043.067|TR0|critical of U.S. foreign policy. 
20101223143043.067|20101223143044.864|TR0|Details on the grand jury case 
20101223143044.864|20101223143046.660|TR0|remain scarce, but the subpoenas 
20101223143046.660|20101223143048.456|TR0|cited federal law prohibiting, 
20101223143048.456|20101223143050.252|TR0|quote, "providing material

20101223143102.825|20101223143104.621|TR0|provisions put them at risk of 
20101223143104.621|20101223143106.417|TR0|being prosecuted for talking to 
20101223143106.417|20101223143108.213|TR0|terrorist groups about

20101223143111.805|20101223143113.602|TR0|Maureen Clare Murphy is the

20101223143122.582|20101223143124.378|TR0|Intifada, though the site is not 
20101223143124.378|20101223143126.174|TR0|being targeted in the FBI probe. 
20101223143126.174|20101223143127.971|TR0|In a statement, the Electronic 
20101223143127.971|20101223143129.767|TR0|Intifada said, quote, "Although

20101223143131.563|20101223143133.359|TR0|has not been a target of any of 
20101223143133.359|20101223143135.155|TR0|the subpoenas, we consider the 
20101223143135.155|20101223143136.951|TR0|grand jury investigation and all 
20101223143136.951|20101223143138.747|TR0|of the subpoenas to be part of a

20101223143142.340|20101223143144.136|TR0|and a threat to all of our

20101223143147.728|20101223143149.524|TR0|We're also joined from 
20101223143149.524|20101223143151.320|TR0|Minneapolis by Tracy Molm. Her 
20101223143151.320|20101223143153.116|TR0|home was among those raided by 
20101223143153.116|20101223143154.912|TR0|FBI agents in September. Some of 
20101223143154.912|20101223143156.709|TR0|her belongings were seized. 
20101223143156.709|20101223143158.505|TR0|She's one of three activists 
20101223143158.505|20101223143200.301|TR0|whose subpoenas were reactivated 
20101223143200.301|20101223143202.097|TR0|earlier this month.

20101223143203.893|20101223143205.689|TR0|And we'll be speaking with two 
20101223143205.689|20101223143207.485|TR0|former FBI agents. Joining us 
20101223143207.485|20101223143209.281|TR0|from Washington, D.C., Mike

20101223143220.058|20101223143221.854|TR0|City, Coleen Rowley. She worked 
20101223143221.854|20101223143223.650|TR0|as an FBI special agent for 
20101223143223.650|20101223143225.447|TR0|almost 24 years. In 2002, she 
20101223143225.447|20101223143227.243|TR0|was named Time Magazine's Person 
20101223143227.243|20101223143229.039|TR0|of the Year after she blew the

20101223143234.427|20101223143236.223|TR0|Let's go first, though, to 
20101223143236.223|20101223143238.019|TR0|Chicago, to Maureen Clare 
20101223143238.019|20101223143239.816|TR0|Murphy, who has just been issued 
20101223143239.816|20101223143241.612|TR0|this subpoena. Maureen, tell us 
20101223143241.612|20101223143243.408|TR0|what you know and what happened. 
20101223143243.408|20101223143245.204|TR0|How were you issued the subpoena?
20101223143245.204|20101223143247.000|TR0|
20101223143247.000|20101223143248.796|TR0|>> MAUREEN CLARE MURPHY: So, I 
20101223143248.796|20101223143250.592|TR0|was in my home office on Tuesday 
20101223143250.592|20101223143252.388|TR0|morning when I got the knock on 
20101223143252.388|20101223143254.185|TR0|the door that more than 20 
20101223143254.185|20101223143255.981|TR0|activists around the country 
20101223143255.981|20101223143257.777|TR0|have now gotten from the FBI. 
20101223143257.777|20101223143259.573|TR0|And so, they rang my buzzer, and 
20101223143259.573|20101223143301.369|TR0|when I answered, they identified 
20101223143301.369|20101223143303.165|TR0|themselves as the FBI, and they 
20101223143303.165|20101223143304.961|TR0|asked me if I would come and 
20101223143304.961|20101223143306.757|TR0|speak with them. And when I 
20101223143306.757|20101223143308.554|TR0|declined, they said they had a 
20101223143308.554|20101223143310.350|TR0|subpoena for me to appear before 
20101223143310.350|20101223143312.146|TR0|a grand jury here in Chicago on 
20101223143312.146|20101223143313.942|TR0|January 25th.

20101223143315.738|20101223143317.534|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And what else 
20101223143317.534|20101223143319.330|TR0|does the subpoena say?
20101223143319.330|20101223143321.126|TR0|
20101223143321.126|20101223143322.923|TR0|>> MAUREEN CLARE MURPHY: And as 
20101223143322.923|20101223143324.719|TR0|you mentioned, my subpoena is - 
20101223143324.719|20101223143326.515|TR0|I'm one of 23 who have now been 
20101223143326.515|20101223143328.311|TR0|subpoenaed, and the FBI also 
20101223143328.311|20101223143330.107|TR0|served subpoenas to three other 
20101223143330.107|20101223143331.903|TR0|activists in Chicago on Tuesday 
20101223143331.903|20101223143333.699|TR0|throughout the city.

20101223143335.495|20101223143337.292|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And did they 
20101223143337.292|20101223143339.088|TR0|attempt to seize any of your 
20101223143339.088|20101223143340.884|TR0|possessions or records or 
20101223143340.884|20101223143342.680|TR0|computers?
20101223143342.680|20101223143344.476|TR0|
20101223143344.476|20101223143346.272|TR0|>> MAUREEN CLARE MURPHY: No, 
20101223143346.272|20101223143348.068|TR0|they did not come into my home. 
20101223143348.068|20101223143349.864|TR0|And none of the activists who 
20101223143349.864|20101223143351.661|TR0|had been subpoenaed since the 
20101223143351.661|20101223143353.457|TR0|September 24th raids, as far as 
20101223143353.457|20101223143355.253|TR0|I know, have had their property 
20101223143355.253|20101223143357.049|TR0|seized or their houses raided. 
20101223143357.049|20101223143358.845|TR0|So, you know, I don't think that 
20101223143358.845|20101223143400.641|TR0|they really need to come into my 
20101223143400.641|20101223143402.437|TR0|home and find out what I do, 
20101223143402.437|20101223143404.234|TR0|because I've always been working 
20101223143404.234|20101223143406.030|TR0|within the mass movement, you 
20101223143406.030|20101223143407.826|TR0|know, calling for the U.S. 
20101223143407.826|20101223143409.622|TR0|government to end U.S. aid to 
20101223143409.622|20101223143411.418|TR0|Israel.
20101223143411.418|20101223143413.214|TR0|
20101223143413.214|20101223143415.010|TR0|And, you know, it's kind of 
20101223143415.010|20101223143416.806|TR0|ironic that we are being 
20101223143416.806|20101223143418.603|TR0|subpoenaed to appear before a 
20101223143418.603|20101223143420.399|TR0|federal grand jury, when 
20101223143420.399|20101223143422.195|TR0|oftentimes we're protesting 
20101223143422.195|20101223143423.991|TR0|outside of federal buildings, 
20101223143423.991|20101223143425.787|TR0|and we're calling on our 
20101223143425.787|20101223143427.583|TR0|legislators and we're being very 
20101223143427.583|20101223143429.379|TR0|vocal and public in our calls 
20101223143429.379|20101223143431.175|TR0|for a more just U.S. foreign 
20101223143431.175|20101223143432.972|TR0|policy in the Middle East. So, I 
20101223143432.972|20101223143434.768|TR0|don't think the government needs 
20101223143434.768|20101223143436.564|TR0|to subpoena us to find out what 
20101223143436.564|20101223143438.360|TR0|we believe in and what we do. 
20101223143438.360|20101223143440.156|TR0|And so, that's why we think this 
20101223143440.156|20101223143441.952|TR0|is really about intimidating our 
20101223143441.952|20101223143443.748|TR0|movement and trying to silence 
20101223143443.748|20101223143445.544|TR0|our movement, because, you know, 
20101223143445.544|20101223143447.341|TR0|they know what we do, and we 
20101223143447.341|20101223143449.137|TR0|know what we do is just and 
20101223143449.137|20101223143450.933|TR0|peaceful. And what it's really 
20101223143450.933|20101223143452.729|TR0|about is basically trying to 
20101223143452.729|20101223143454.525|TR0|silence our very strong and 
20101223143454.525|20101223143456.321|TR0|successful movement.
20101223143456.321|20101223143458.117|TR0|
20101223143458.117|20101223143459.913|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We want to turn 
20101223143459.913|20101223143501.710|TR0|right now to go back to two 
20101223143501.710|20101223143503.506|TR0|activists who we spoke to 
20101223143503.506|20101223143505.302|TR0|earlier this year. And as we 
20101223143505.302|20101223143507.098|TR0|cover this widening net that is 
20101223143507.098|20101223143508.894|TR0|ensnaring a number of people, we 
20101223143508.894|20101223143510.690|TR0|wanted to remind you of who 
20101223143510.690|20101223143512.486|TR0|these people are. Their homes 
20101223143512.486|20101223143514.282|TR0|were raided. They told their 
20101223143514.282|20101223143516.079|TR0|stories on Democracy Now! We 
20101223143516.079|20101223143517.875|TR0|spoke to Joe Iosbaker in Chicago 
20101223143517.875|20101223143519.671|TR0|and Jess Sundin in Minneapolis.
20101223143519.671|20101223143521.467|TR0|
20101223143521.467|20101223143523.263|TR0|>> JESS SUNDIN: Friday morning, 
20101223143523.263|20101223143525.059|TR0|I awoke to a bang at the door, 
20101223143525.059|20101223143526.855|TR0|and by the time I was 
20101223143526.855|20101223143528.651|TR0|downstairs, there were six or 
20101223143528.651|20101223143530.448|TR0|seven federal agents already in 
20101223143530.448|20101223143532.244|TR0|my home, where my partner and my 
20101223143532.244|20101223143534.040|TR0|six-year-old daughter had 
20101223143534.040|20101223143535.836|TR0|already been awake. We were 
20101223143535.836|20101223143537.632|TR0|given the search warrant, and 
20101223143537.632|20101223143539.428|TR0|they went through the entire 
20101223143539.428|20101223143541.224|TR0|house. They spent probably about 
20101223143541.224|20101223143543.020|TR0|four hours going through all of 
20101223143543.020|20101223143544.817|TR0|our personal belongings, every 
20101223143544.817|20101223143546.613|TR0|book, paper, our clothes, and 
20101223143546.613|20101223143548.409|TR0|filled several boxes and crates 
20101223143548.409|20101223143550.205|TR0|with our computers, our phones, 
20101223143550.205|20101223143552.001|TR0|my passport. And when they were 
20101223143552.001|20101223143553.797|TR0|done, as I said, they had many 
20101223143553.797|20101223143555.593|TR0|crates full of my personal 
20101223143555.593|20101223143557.389|TR0|belongings, with which they left 
20101223143557.389|20101223143559.186|TR0|my house.
20101223143559.186|20101223143600.982|TR0|
20101223143600.982|20101223143602.778|TR0|>> JOE IOSBAKER: It was a 
20101223143602.778|20101223143604.574|TR0|nationally coordinated assault 
20101223143604.574|20101223143606.370|TR0|on all of these homes. Seven 
20101223143606.370|20101223143608.166|TR0|a.m., the pound on the door. I 
20101223143608.166|20101223143609.962|TR0|was getting ready for work, came 
20101223143609.962|20101223143611.758|TR0|down the stairs, and there were, 
20101223143611.758|20101223143613.555|TR0|I think, in the area of 10 
20101223143613.555|20101223143615.351|TR0|agents, you know, of the - they 
20101223143615.351|20101223143617.147|TR0|identified themselves as FBI, 
20101223143617.147|20101223143618.943|TR0|showed me the search warrant. 
20101223143618.943|20101223143620.739|TR0|And I turned to my wife and 
20101223143620.739|20101223143622.535|TR0|said, "Stephanie, it's the 
20101223143622.535|20101223143624.331|TR0|Thought Police."
20101223143624.331|20101223143626.127|TR0|
20101223143626.127|20101223143627.924|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That's Joe 
20101223143627.924|20101223143629.720|TR0|Iosbaker and Jess Sundin, who - 
20101223143629.720|20101223143631.516|TR0|Jess in Minneapolis. Like them, 
20101223143631.516|20101223143633.312|TR0|Tracy Molm's home was raided by 
20101223143633.312|20101223143635.108|TR0|FBI agents in September, some of 
20101223143635.108|20101223143636.904|TR0|her belongings seized, one of 
20101223143636.904|20101223143638.700|TR0|three activists whose subpoenas 
20101223143638.700|20101223143640.496|TR0|now have been reactivated. Tell 
20101223143640.496|20101223143642.293|TR0|us what has happened now, Tracy.
20101223143642.293|20101223143644.089|TR0|
20101223143644.089|20101223143645.885|TR0|>> TRACY MOLM: Right now, our 
20101223143645.885|20101223143647.681|TR0|individual lawyers are being 
20101223143647.681|20101223143649.477|TR0|called into meetings with the 
20101223143649.477|20101223143651.273|TR0|District Attorney, Fox, in 
20101223143651.273|20101223143653.069|TR0|Chicago. They're essentially 
20101223143653.069|20101223143654.865|TR0|trying to scare us into talking, 
20101223143654.865|20101223143656.662|TR0|to naming names and giving them 
20101223143656.662|20101223143658.458|TR0|a case against the movement and 
20101223143658.458|20101223143700.254|TR0|against the people that we have 
20101223143700.254|20101223143702.050|TR0|worked with historically to 
20101223143702.050|20101223143703.846|TR0|fight for justice for the people 
20101223143703.846|20101223143705.642|TR0|of Palestine and the people of 
20101223143705.642|20101223143707.438|TR0|Colombia.
20101223143707.438|20101223143709.234|TR0|
20101223143709.234|20101223143711.031|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, we're 
20101223143711.031|20101223143712.827|TR0|also joined on the phone by 
20101223143712.827|20101223143714.623|TR0|Coleen Rowley, a former FBI 
20101223143714.623|20101223143716.419|TR0|agent who was named by Time 
20101223143716.419|20101223143718.215|TR0|Magazine Woman of the Year for 
20101223143718.215|20101223143720.011|TR0|her exposure of the problems in 
20101223143720.011|20101223143721.807|TR0|intelligence by the FBI 
20101223143721.807|20101223143723.603|TR0|pre-9/11. Your reaction to these 
20101223143723.603|20101223143725.400|TR0|raids, especially since they all 
20101223143725.400|20101223143727.196|TR0|seem to be focused around people 
20101223143727.196|20101223143728.992|TR0|who are involved in Palestinian 
20101223143728.992|20101223143730.788|TR0|solidarity work and there's 
20101223143730.788|20101223143732.584|TR0|certainly no indication that 
20101223143732.584|20101223143734.380|TR0|there's any terrorist threat to 
20101223143734.380|20101223143736.176|TR0|the United States here from the 
20101223143736.176|20101223143737.972|TR0|Palestinian movement?
20101223143737.972|20101223143739.769|TR0|
20101223143739.769|20101223143741.565|TR0|>> COLEEN ROWLEY: Well, you 
20101223143741.565|20101223143743.361|TR0|know, after 9/11, we almost - 
20101223143743.361|20101223143745.157|TR0|there was a green light put on, 
20101223143745.157|20101223143746.953|TR0|and there was a very big 
20101223143746.953|20101223143748.749|TR0|blurring between protest, civil 
20101223143748.749|20101223143750.545|TR0|disobedience and terrorism. And 
20101223143750.545|20101223143752.342|TR0|you saw this in many ways. The 
20101223143752.342|20101223143754.138|TR0|door was open to basically 
20101223143754.138|20101223143755.934|TR0|targeting, without any level of 
20101223143755.934|20101223143757.730|TR0|factual justification, advocacy 
20101223143757.730|20101223143759.526|TR0|groups. And again, this began 
20101223143759.526|20101223143801.322|TR0|pretty quickly after 9/11.
20101223143801.322|20101223143803.118|TR0|
20101223143803.118|20101223143804.914|TR0|It's gotten to the point now, 
20101223143804.914|20101223143806.711|TR0|nine years later - and I wanted 
20101223143806.711|20101223143808.507|TR0|to mention the Washington Post 
20101223143808.507|20101223143810.303|TR0|is doing a pretty good job of 
20101223143810.303|20101223143812.099|TR0|exposing this, this top-secret 
20101223143812.099|20101223143813.895|TR0|America, this monitoring. Their 
20101223143813.895|20101223143815.691|TR0|most recent article in the 
20101223143815.691|20101223143817.487|TR0|Washington Post says there's a 
20101223143817.487|20101223143819.283|TR0|hundred - the FBI has 164,000 
20101223143819.283|20101223143821.080|TR0|suspicious activity reports. 
20101223143821.080|20101223143822.876|TR0|Again, these are things that 
20101223143822.876|20101223143824.672|TR0|just have no level of factual 
20101223143824.672|20101223143826.468|TR0|justification, that people call 
20101223143826.468|20101223143828.264|TR0|in, and the FBI is now keeping 
20101223143828.264|20101223143830.060|TR0|records on people. So, I think 
20101223143830.060|20101223143831.856|TR0|that, you know, this case will 
20101223143831.856|20101223143833.652|TR0|just be the start of targeting 
20101223143833.652|20101223143835.449|TR0|various groups like this.

20101223143837.245|20101223143839.041|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to turn 
20101223143839.041|20101223143840.837|TR0|to a clip of an interview we did 
20101223143840.837|20101223143842.633|TR0|recently when Bruce Nestor came 
20101223143842.633|20101223143844.429|TR0|into town, the former head of 
20101223143844.429|20101223143846.225|TR0|the National Lawyers Guild in 
20101223143846.225|20101223143848.021|TR0|Minneapolis. He's representing 
20101223143848.021|20101223143849.818|TR0|those who have been summoned 
20101223143849.818|20101223143851.614|TR0|before the grand jury. Bruce 
20101223143851.614|20101223143853.410|TR0|Nestor talked about potential 
20101223143853.410|20101223143855.206|TR0|consequences the activists face 
20101223143855.206|20101223143857.002|TR0|for defying subpoenas.
20101223143857.002|20101223143858.798|TR0|
20101223143858.798|20101223143900.594|TR0|>> BRUCE NESTOR: Three people 
20101223143900.594|20101223143902.390|TR0|are now being - looking at 
20101223143902.390|20101223143904.187|TR0|reappearing in front of the 
20101223143904.187|20101223143905.983|TR0|grand jury and likely being 
20101223143905.983|20101223143907.779|TR0|forced with the choice between 
20101223143907.779|20101223143909.575|TR0|talking about who they meet 
20101223143909.575|20101223143911.371|TR0|with, what the political beliefs 
20101223143911.371|20101223143913.167|TR0|of their friends and allies are, 
20101223143913.167|20101223143914.963|TR0|or perhaps risking contempt and 
20101223143914.963|20101223143916.759|TR0|sitting in jail for 18 months. 
20101223143916.759|20101223143918.556|TR0|These are people who are deeply 
20101223143918.556|20101223143920.352|TR0|rooted in the progressive 
20101223143920.352|20101223143922.148|TR0|community in Chicago and 
20101223143922.148|20101223143923.944|TR0|Minneapolis. These are 
20101223143923.944|20101223143925.740|TR0|grandmothers, they're mothers, 
20101223143925.740|20101223143927.536|TR0|they're union activists. They 
20101223143927.536|20101223143929.332|TR0|were some of the organizers of 
20101223143929.332|20101223143931.128|TR0|the largest antiwar march at the 
20101223143931.128|20101223143932.925|TR0|2008 Republican National 
20101223143932.925|20101223143934.721|TR0|Convention.

20101223143936.517|20101223143938.313|TR0|And so - and they're being 
20101223143938.313|20101223143940.109|TR0|prosecuted under this material 
20101223143940.109|20101223143941.905|TR0|support for terrorism law, a law 
20101223143941.905|20101223143943.701|TR0|that was really enhanced under 
20101223143943.701|20101223143945.497|TR0|the PATRIOT Act and that allows, 
20101223143945.497|20101223143947.294|TR0|in the government's own words, 
20101223143947.294|20101223143949.090|TR0|for people to be prosecuted for 
20101223143949.090|20101223143950.886|TR0|their speech if they coordinate 
20101223143950.886|20101223143952.682|TR0|it with a designated foreign 
20101223143952.682|20101223143954.478|TR0|terrorist organization. What you 
20101223143954.478|20101223143956.274|TR0|run the risk of there is that 
20101223143956.274|20101223143958.070|TR0|even if you state your own 
20101223143958.070|20101223143959.866|TR0|independent views about U.S. 
20101223143959.866|20101223144001.663|TR0|foreign policy, but those views 
20101223144001.663|20101223144003.459|TR0|somehow reflect a group that the 
20101223144003.459|20101223144005.255|TR0|U.S. has designated as a 
20101223144005.255|20101223144007.051|TR0|terrorist organization, you can 
20101223144007.051|20101223144008.847|TR0|be accused of coordinating your 
20101223144008.847|20101223144010.643|TR0|views and face, if not 
20101223144010.643|20101223144012.439|TR0|prosecution, at least 
20101223144012.439|20101223144014.235|TR0|investigation, search warrants, 
20101223144014.235|20101223144016.032|TR0|being summoned to a grand jury 
20101223144016.032|20101223144017.828|TR0|to talk about who your political 
20101223144017.828|20101223144019.624|TR0|allies and who your political 
20101223144019.624|20101223144021.420|TR0|friends are.

20101223144023.216|20101223144025.012|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That was Bruce 
20101223144025.012|20101223144026.808|TR0|Nestor, who's representing some 
20101223144026.808|20101223144028.604|TR0|of those being subpoenaed, 
20101223144028.604|20101223144030.401|TR0|former head of the Naitonal 
20101223144030.401|20101223144032.197|TR0|Lawyers Guild in the Twin 
20101223144032.197|20101223144033.993|TR0|Cities. Mike German is joining 
20101223144033.993|20101223144035.789|TR0|us from Washington, D.C., 
20101223144035.789|20101223144037.585|TR0|National Security Policy Counsel 
20101223144037.585|20101223144039.381|TR0|for the American Civil Liberties 
20101223144039.381|20101223144041.177|TR0|Union. He was an FBI agent 
20101223144041.177|20101223144042.973|TR0|specializing in domestic 
20101223144042.973|20101223144044.770|TR0|counterterrorism for many years. 
20101223144044.770|20101223144046.566|TR0|Mike, talk about your assessment 
20101223144046.566|20101223144048.362|TR0|of this widening dragnet and its 
20101223144048.362|20101223144050.158|TR0|consequences.
20101223144050.158|20101223144051.954|TR0|
20101223144051.954|20101223144053.750|TR0|>> MIKE GERMAN: Well, I think 
20101223144053.750|20101223144055.546|TR0|part of the problem is sort of 
20101223144055.546|20101223144057.342|TR0|the scope of this investigation 
20101223144057.342|20101223144059.139|TR0|and the aggressive tactics that 
20101223144059.139|20101223144100.935|TR0|are being used, when there isn't 
20101223144100.935|20101223144102.731|TR0|any public evidence to suggest 
20101223144102.731|20101223144104.527|TR0|these people pose a threat. In 
20101223144104.527|20101223144106.323|TR0|fact, the FBI spokesman said 
20101223144106.323|20101223144108.119|TR0|immediately after the raids that 
20101223144108.119|20101223144109.915|TR0|there wasn't a threat to the 
20101223144109.915|20101223144111.711|TR0|community. So, it sort of leads 
20101223144111.711|20101223144113.508|TR0|to a question of why there is 
20101223144113.508|20101223144115.304|TR0|this nationwide, you know, early 
20101223144115.304|20101223144117.100|TR0|morning raids, as if these are 
20101223144117.100|20101223144118.896|TR0|Mafia groups, when, you know, 
20101223144118.896|20101223144120.692|TR0|it's clear from the materials 
20101223144120.692|20101223144122.488|TR0|that are being seized, the 
20101223144122.488|20101223144124.284|TR0|materials that are being 
20101223144124.284|20101223144126.080|TR0|requested in the search warrant 
20101223144126.080|20101223144127.877|TR0|returns that are public, that a 
20101223144127.877|20101223144129.673|TR0|lot of this is associational 
20101223144129.673|20101223144131.469|TR0|information that's being 
20101223144131.469|20101223144133.265|TR0|requested - address books, 
20101223144133.265|20101223144135.061|TR0|computer records, literature and 
20101223144135.061|20101223144136.857|TR0|advocacy materials, First 
20101223144136.857|20101223144138.653|TR0|Amendment sort of materials.
20101223144138.653|20101223144140.450|TR0|
20101223144140.450|20101223144142.246|TR0|So, this creates a huge chill 
20101223144142.246|20101223144144.042|TR0|beyond these activists or their 
20101223144144.042|20101223144145.838|TR0|associates to the entire 
20101223144145.838|20101223144147.634|TR0|advocacy community, where, you 
20101223144147.634|20101223144149.430|TR0|know, again, these people, as 
20101223144149.430|20101223144151.226|TR0|already stated, have 
20101223144151.226|20101223144153.022|TR0|longstanding advocacy histories, 
20101223144153.022|20101223144154.819|TR0|you know, are organizers, know a 
20101223144154.819|20101223144156.615|TR0|lot of people in the community. 
20101223144156.615|20101223144158.411|TR0|So it creates a chill 
20101223144158.411|20101223144200.207|TR0|throughout, and it damages our 
20101223144200.207|20101223144202.003|TR0|democracy, because people start 
20101223144202.003|20101223144203.799|TR0|to be afraid of participating in 
20101223144203.799|20101223144205.595|TR0|the political process. And that 
20101223144205.595|20101223144207.391|TR0|really is a huge problem beyond 
20101223144207.391|20101223144209.188|TR0|the scope of just the 
20101223144209.188|20101223144210.984|TR0|individuals involved in this 
20101223144210.984|20101223144212.780|TR0|case. And, you know, the fact 
20101223144212.780|20101223144214.576|TR0|that the FBI is doing this and 
20101223144214.576|20101223144216.372|TR0|using terms like "terrorism" to 
20101223144216.372|20101223144218.168|TR0|describe these individuals 
20101223144218.168|20101223144219.964|TR0|creates a huge chilling effect 
20101223144219.964|20101223144221.760|TR0|that we really have to be 
20101223144221.760|20101223144223.557|TR0|concerned about.
20101223144223.557|20101223144225.353|TR0|
20101223144225.353|20101223144227.149|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Mike, I wanted 
20101223144227.149|20101223144228.945|TR0|to ask you - I don't know if 
20101223144228.945|20101223144230.741|TR0|it's exactly related, but new 
20101223144230.741|20101223144232.537|TR0|details on how the United States 
20101223144232.537|20101223144234.333|TR0|has assembled a vast domestic 
20101223144234.333|20101223144236.129|TR0|intelligence apparatus to 
20101223144236.129|20101223144237.926|TR0|collect information about 
20101223144237.926|20101223144239.722|TR0|Americans, using the FBI, local 
20101223144239.722|20101223144241.518|TR0|police, state homeland security 
20101223144241.518|20101223144243.314|TR0|offices and military criminal 
20101223144243.314|20101223144245.110|TR0|investigators. Another 
20101223144245.110|20101223144246.906|TR0|Washington Post expose on this, 
20101223144246.906|20101223144248.702|TR0|the FBI operating a massive 
20101223144248.702|20101223144250.498|TR0|database known as Guardian with 
20101223144250.498|20101223144252.295|TR0|the names and personal 
20101223144252.295|20101223144254.091|TR0|information of thousands of U.S. 
20101223144254.091|20101223144255.887|TR0|citizens and residents who have 
20101223144255.887|20101223144257.683|TR0|never committed a crime but were 
20101223144257.683|20101223144259.479|TR0|reported to have acted 
20101223144259.479|20101223144301.275|TR0|suspiciously by a local police 
20101223144301.275|20101223144303.071|TR0|officer or a fellow citizen, the 
20101223144303.071|20101223144304.867|TR0|database containing over 160,000 
20101223144304.867|20101223144306.664|TR0|suspicious activity files. 
20101223144306.664|20101223144308.460|TR0|Despite the sweeping size of the 
20101223144308.460|20101223144310.256|TR0|database, the Washington Post 
20101223144310.256|20101223144312.052|TR0|reports, the FBI says it's 
20101223144312.052|20101223144313.848|TR0|resulted in only five arrests 
20101223144313.848|20101223144315.644|TR0|and no convictions. In addition, 
20101223144315.644|20101223144317.440|TR0|the Post reveals the FBI is 
20101223144317.440|20101223144319.236|TR0|storing 96 million fingerprints 
20101223144319.236|20101223144321.033|TR0|in Clarksburg, West Virginia.
20101223144321.033|20101223144322.829|TR0|
20101223144322.829|20101223144324.625|TR0|And the Post also reports that 
20101223144324.625|20101223144326.421|TR0|local law enforcement agencies 
20101223144326.421|20101223144328.217|TR0|have begun using surveillance 
20101223144328.217|20101223144330.013|TR0|equipment designed for war 
20101223144330.013|20101223144331.809|TR0|zones. In Memphis, Tennessee, 
20101223144331.809|20101223144333.605|TR0|some police patrol cars now 
20101223144333.605|20101223144335.402|TR0|contain military-grade infrared 
20101223144335.402|20101223144337.198|TR0|cameras that can snap digital 
20101223144337.198|20101223144338.994|TR0|images of one license plate 
20101223144338.994|20101223144340.790|TR0|after another, while analyzing 
20101223144340.790|20101223144342.586|TR0|each almost instantly.
20101223144342.586|20101223144344.382|TR0|
20101223144344.382|20101223144346.178|TR0|Mike German, you have worked in 
20101223144346.178|20101223144347.974|TR0|counterterrorism for years, 
20101223144347.974|20101223144349.771|TR0|before being at the ACLU, from 
20101223144349.771|20101223144351.567|TR0|1988 to 2004. What's going on 
20101223144351.567|20101223144353.363|TR0|here? What are the dangers with 
20101223144353.363|20101223144355.159|TR0|this?
20101223144355.159|20101223144356.955|TR0|
20101223144356.955|20101223144358.751|TR0|>> MIKE GERMAN: Well, you know, 
20101223144358.751|20101223144400.547|TR0|you might remember a program 
20101223144400.547|20101223144402.343|TR0|called Total Information 
20101223144402.343|20101223144404.140|TR0|Awareness that was started right 
20101223144404.140|20101223144405.936|TR0|after 9/11, and the idea was, if 
20101223144405.936|20101223144407.732|TR0|we can just grab all the 
20101223144407.732|20101223144409.528|TR0|available data that's out there, 
20101223144409.528|20101223144411.324|TR0|somehow we'll be able to manage 
20101223144411.324|20101223144413.120|TR0|it in a way that we'll know 
20101223144413.120|20101223144414.916|TR0|everything that's happening. And 
20101223144414.916|20101223144416.712|TR0|while Congress killed that 
20101223144416.712|20101223144418.509|TR0|specific program, that idea 
20101223144418.509|20101223144420.305|TR0|never disappeared.
20101223144420.305|20101223144422.101|TR0|
20101223144422.101|20101223144423.897|TR0|And the FBI appears to be at the 
20101223144423.897|20101223144425.693|TR0|center of one of these expansive 
20101223144425.693|20101223144427.489|TR0|collection programs called 
20101223144427.489|20101223144429.285|TR0|eGuardian, is the new one. 
20101223144429.285|20101223144431.081|TR0|Guardian is one that's been 
20101223144431.081|20101223144432.878|TR0|around for a while. But now 
20101223144432.878|20101223144434.674|TR0|there's a new one, eGuardian, 
20101223144434.674|20101223144436.470|TR0|that's part of a nationwide 
20101223144436.470|20101223144438.266|TR0|suspicious activity reporting 
20101223144438.266|20101223144440.062|TR0|program that encourages state 
20101223144440.062|20101223144441.858|TR0|and local law enforcement 
20101223144441.858|20101223144443.654|TR0|agencies, as well as the general 
20101223144443.654|20101223144445.450|TR0|public, to report behaviors that 
20101223144445.450|20101223144447.247|TR0|they describe as inherently 
20101223144447.247|20101223144449.043|TR0|suspicious, and these include 
20101223144449.043|20101223144450.839|TR0|things like taking notes or 
20101223144450.839|20101223144452.635|TR0|drawing diagrams, taking 
20101223144452.635|20101223144454.431|TR0|measurements, taking photographs 
20101223144454.431|20101223144456.227|TR0|or video. So, of course, these 
20101223144456.227|20101223144458.023|TR0|are benign activities that have 
20101223144458.023|20101223144459.819|TR0|no inherent suspicion regarding 
20101223144459.819|20101223144501.616|TR0|them, so what we're concerned 
20101223144501.616|20101223144503.412|TR0|with is what people will really 
20101223144503.412|20101223144505.208|TR0|be reporting is people that, 
20101223144505.208|20101223144507.004|TR0|because of their own personal 
20101223144507.004|20101223144508.800|TR0|bias, are already suspicious of. 
20101223144508.800|20101223144510.596|TR0|You know, it won't be everybody 
20101223144510.596|20101223144512.392|TR0|who's taking notes; it's only 
20101223144512.392|20101223144514.189|TR0|going to be that person who 
20101223144514.189|20101223144515.985|TR0|wears religious garb that they 
20101223144515.985|20101223144517.781|TR0|are, you know, religiously 
20101223144517.781|20101223144519.577|TR0|biased against or, you know, a 
20101223144519.577|20101223144521.373|TR0|person of a specific race or 
20101223144521.373|20101223144523.169|TR0|nationality. So, what this 
20101223144523.169|20101223144524.965|TR0|allows, this sort of reduction 
20101223144524.965|20101223144526.761|TR0|in standards allows the 
20101223144526.761|20101223144528.558|TR0|collection of material against 
20101223144528.558|20101223144530.354|TR0|people who are not even 
20101223144530.354|20101223144532.150|TR0|suspected of being involved in 
20101223144532.150|20101223144533.946|TR0|wrongdoing. And that is really 
20101223144533.946|20101223144535.742|TR0|an open door to abuse.
20101223144535.742|20101223144537.538|TR0|
20101223144537.538|20101223144539.334|TR0|And we have Freedom of 
20101223144539.334|20101223144541.130|TR0|Information Act requests 
20101223144541.130|20101223144542.927|TR0|outstanding for the eGuardian 
20101223144542.927|20101223144544.723|TR0|program. We're interested in a 
20101223144544.723|20101223144546.519|TR0|lot of different new FBI 
20101223144546.519|20101223144548.315|TR0|programs. There's a Domain 
20101223144548.315|20101223144550.111|TR0|Management program, which 
20101223144550.111|20101223144551.907|TR0|purports to allow the FBI to 
20101223144551.907|20101223144553.703|TR0|collect racial and ethnic 
20101223144553.703|20101223144555.499|TR0|demographic information and map 
20101223144555.499|20101223144557.296|TR0|our communities across the 
20101223144557.296|20101223144559.092|TR0|nation by race and ethnicity. 
20101223144559.092|20101223144600.888|TR0|So, again, this suspicion-less 
20101223144600.888|20101223144602.684|TR0|collection information is a huge 
20101223144602.684|20101223144604.480|TR0|and growing problem, and all of 
20101223144604.480|20101223144606.276|TR0|this data just is being 
20101223144606.276|20101223144608.072|TR0|warehoused, literally - I mean, 
20101223144608.072|20101223144609.868|TR0|that's what they call it, the 
20101223144609.868|20101223144611.665|TR0|Investigative Data Warehouse - 
20101223144611.665|20101223144613.461|TR0|for any kind of abuse that might 
20101223144613.461|20101223144615.257|TR0|occur later. And, of course, you 
20101223144615.257|20101223144617.053|TR0|know, the ACLU has already 
20101223144617.053|20101223144618.849|TR0|documented these types of spying 
20101223144618.849|20101223144620.645|TR0|operations being directed 
20101223144620.645|20101223144622.441|TR0|against political advocacy in 33 
20101223144622.441|20101223144624.237|TR0|states across the nation. In 
20101223144624.237|20101223144626.034|TR0|fact, when the latest Washington 
20101223144626.034|20101223144627.830|TR0|Post report came out, one of the 
20101223144627.830|20101223144629.626|TR0|intelligence collection 
20101223144629.626|20101223144631.422|TR0|operations it focused on was the 
20101223144631.422|20101223144633.218|TR0|Tennessee fusion centers. And 
20101223144633.218|20101223144635.014|TR0|one of our legal fellows became 
20101223144635.014|20101223144636.810|TR0|interested upon reading the 
20101223144636.810|20101223144638.606|TR0|article and went to the website, 
20101223144638.606|20101223144640.403|TR0|and sure enough, one of the 
20101223144640.403|20101223144642.199|TR0|suspicious activities reported 
20101223144642.199|20101223144643.995|TR0|on the website was an ACLU 
20101223144643.995|20101223144645.791|TR0|advocacy effort regarding the 
20101223144645.791|20101223144647.587|TR0|celebration of religious 
20101223144647.587|20101223144649.383|TR0|activities in public schools. 
20101223144649.383|20101223144651.179|TR0|So, clearly, they're collecting 
20101223144651.179|20101223144652.975|TR0|information about political 
20101223144652.975|20101223144654.772|TR0|advocacy, and this is part of 
20101223144654.772|20101223144656.568|TR0|the larger problem across the 
20101223144656.568|20101223144658.364|TR0|country.
20101223144658.364|20101223144700.160|TR0|
20101223144700.160|20101223144701.956|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, Mike, 
20101223144701.956|20101223144703.752|TR0|I'd like to ask you - this is 
20101223144703.752|20101223144705.548|TR0|not the first time in U.S. 
20101223144705.548|20101223144707.344|TR0|history that we've had these 
20101223144707.344|20101223144709.141|TR0|problems. I think back - you 
20101223144709.141|20101223144710.937|TR0|mentioned Total Information 
20101223144710.937|20101223144712.733|TR0|Awareness. But going back even 
20101223144712.733|20101223144714.529|TR0|further, several decades ago, 
20101223144714.529|20101223144716.325|TR0|the Church Commission uncovered 
20101223144716.325|20101223144718.121|TR0|all kinds of spying by the U.S. 
20101223144718.121|20101223144719.917|TR0|government on legal dissident 
20101223144719.917|20101223144721.713|TR0|groups in the United States. 
20101223144721.713|20101223144723.510|TR0|And, of course, back in the 
20101223144723.510|20101223144725.306|TR0|1920s during the Palmer Raids, 
20101223144725.306|20101223144727.102|TR0|there was all kinds of 
20101223144727.102|20101223144728.898|TR0|government attempts to round up 
20101223144728.898|20101223144730.694|TR0|people who were involved in what 
20101223144730.694|20101223144732.490|TR0|is normally legal, but 
20101223144732.490|20101223144734.286|TR0|opposition, politics of one kind 
20101223144734.286|20101223144736.082|TR0|or another. How come there is so 
20101223144736.082|20101223144737.879|TR0|little outcry in the general 
20101223144737.879|20101223144739.675|TR0|population of these enormous 
20101223144739.675|20101223144741.471|TR0|attempts by the government to 
20101223144741.471|20101223144743.267|TR0|take away civil liberties and to 
20101223144743.267|20101223144745.063|TR0|spy on the citizens?
20101223144745.063|20101223144746.859|TR0|
20101223144746.859|20101223144748.655|TR0|>> MIKE GERMAN: You know, you're 
20101223144748.655|20101223144750.451|TR0|exactly right. There is, you 
20101223144750.451|20101223144752.248|TR0|know, a long history of abuse of 
20101223144752.248|20101223144754.044|TR0|secret domestic intelligence 
20101223144754.044|20101223144755.840|TR0|powers. And that's why after the 
20101223144755.840|20101223144757.636|TR0|Church Committee uncovered those 
20101223144757.636|20101223144759.432|TR0|abuses in the 1970s, there were 
20101223144759.432|20101223144801.228|TR0|guidelines put in place, the 
20101223144801.228|20101223144803.024|TR0|Attorney General Guidelines, 
20101223144803.024|20101223144804.820|TR0|that required a reasonable 
20101223144804.820|20101223144806.617|TR0|suspicion of wrongdoing before 
20101223144806.617|20101223144808.413|TR0|the FBI could start aggressive 
20101223144808.413|20101223144810.209|TR0|investigations. And those were 
20101223144810.209|20101223144812.005|TR0|the standards that I operated 
20101223144812.005|20101223144813.801|TR0|on, doing domestic terrorism 
20101223144813.801|20101223144815.597|TR0|investigations. And I found they 
20101223144815.597|20101223144817.393|TR0|were very helpful, that what it 
20101223144817.393|20101223144819.189|TR0|did is it helped me focus on 
20101223144819.189|20101223144820.986|TR0|people who were actually doing 
20101223144820.986|20101223144822.782|TR0|bad things, rather than people 
20101223144822.782|20101223144824.578|TR0|who were saying things that I 
20101223144824.578|20101223144826.374|TR0|didn't like or didn't agree 
20101223144826.374|20101223144828.170|TR0|with, and that that helped me 
20101223144828.170|20101223144829.966|TR0|use my resources in an efficient 
20101223144829.966|20101223144831.762|TR0|way to target the people who 
20101223144831.762|20101223144833.558|TR0|were doing bad things. And 
20101223144833.558|20101223144835.355|TR0|unfortunately, after 9/11, those 
20101223144835.355|20101223144837.151|TR0|standards have been diluted 
20101223144837.151|20101223144838.947|TR0|significantly to where now the 
20101223144838.947|20101223144840.743|TR0|FBI literally requires no 
20101223144840.743|20101223144842.539|TR0|factual predicate to start an 
20101223144842.539|20101223144844.335|TR0|investigation.
20101223144844.335|20101223144846.131|TR0|
20101223144846.131|20101223144847.927|TR0|And as far as the public 
20101223144847.927|20101223144849.724|TR0|outrage, a huge part of the 
20101223144849.724|20101223144851.520|TR0|problem is, again, these 
20101223144851.520|20101223144853.316|TR0|activities are taking place in 
20101223144853.316|20101223144855.112|TR0|secret. So it's hard to know how 
20101223144855.112|20101223144856.908|TR0|they're impacting any particular 
20101223144856.908|20101223144858.704|TR0|group or individual. And that's 
20101223144858.704|20101223144900.500|TR0|why we set up a website, the Spy 
20101223144900.500|20101223144902.297|TR0|Files website, 
20101223144902.297|20101223144904.093|TR0|aclu.org/spyfiles, where we're 
20101223144904.093|20101223144905.889|TR0|collecting a lot of this 
20101223144905.889|20101223144907.685|TR0|material. And, you know, it's 
20101223144907.685|20101223144909.481|TR0|not just the FBI that's spying 
20101223144909.481|20101223144911.277|TR0|now; it's Department of Homeland 
20101223144911.277|20101223144913.073|TR0|Security, it's the Department of 
20101223144913.073|20101223144914.869|TR0|Defense, it's state and local 
20101223144914.869|20101223144916.666|TR0|law enforcement agencies that 
20101223144916.666|20101223144918.462|TR0|are involved in these 
20101223144918.462|20101223144920.258|TR0|activities. So, you know, this 
20101223144920.258|20101223144922.054|TR0|Washington Post story, I think, 
20101223144922.054|20101223144923.850|TR0|will be a big help to let people 
20101223144923.850|20101223144925.646|TR0|know that, you know, your 
20101223144925.646|20101223144927.442|TR0|innocence doesn't protect you 
20101223144927.442|20101223144929.238|TR0|anymore, that they can literally 
20101223144929.238|20101223144931.035|TR0|start collecting information on 
20101223144931.035|20101223144932.831|TR0|anyone.
20101223144932.831|20101223144934.627|TR0|
20101223144934.627|20101223144936.423|TR0|And, you know, we had a recent 
20101223144936.423|20101223144938.219|TR0|case in Maryland where the 
20101223144938.219|20101223144940.015|TR0|Maryland state police were 
20101223144940.015|20101223144941.811|TR0|spying on political activists. 
20101223144941.811|20101223144943.607|TR0|And one of the activists said 
20101223144943.607|20101223144945.404|TR0|something very interesting to 
20101223144945.404|20101223144947.200|TR0|me. She said, you know, "I was a 
20101223144947.200|20101223144948.996|TR0|Vietnam War protester. So when I 
20101223144948.996|20101223144950.792|TR0|became a war protester again 
20101223144950.792|20101223144952.588|TR0|with the recent conflicts, I 
20101223144952.588|20101223144954.384|TR0|kind of assumed that the 
20101223144954.384|20101223144956.180|TR0|government would be spying on 
20101223144956.180|20101223144957.976|TR0|me. But when I finally got those 
20101223144957.976|20101223144959.773|TR0|records back, what scared me 
20101223144959.773|20101223145001.569|TR0|more than anything was that much 
20101223145001.569|20101223145003.365|TR0|of the information was wrong. 
20101223145003.365|20101223145005.161|TR0|They had me at demonstrations I 
20101223145005.161|20101223145006.957|TR0|wasn't at. They had me 
20101223145006.957|20101223145008.753|TR0|associated with groups I wasn't 
20101223145008.753|20101223145010.549|TR0|associated with. And that scared 
20101223145010.549|20101223145012.345|TR0|me more, because now my doing 
20101223145012.345|20101223145014.142|TR0|everything right and not being 
20101223145014.142|20101223145015.938|TR0|involved in violence wasn't 
20101223145015.938|20101223145017.734|TR0|going to protect me from their 
20101223145017.734|20101223145019.530|TR0|errors, and I could be 
20101223145019.530|20101223145021.326|TR0|associated with things that I 
20101223145021.326|20101223145023.122|TR0|wasn't actually doing." And 
20101223145023.122|20101223145024.918|TR0|that's really a big part of the 
20101223145024.918|20101223145026.714|TR0|problem.
20101223145026.714|20101223145028.511|TR0|
20101223145028.511|20101223145030.307|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We only have 30 
20101223145030.307|20101223145032.103|TR0|seconds, but I wanted to go back 
20101223145032.103|20101223145033.899|TR0|to Coleen Rowley, another former 
20101223145033.899|20101223145035.695|TR0|FBI agent, on a related issue, 
20101223145035.695|20101223145037.491|TR0|and it's WikiLeaks. You have 
20101223145037.491|20101223145039.287|TR0|signed on, along with a number 
20101223145039.287|20101223145041.083|TR0|of other people, like Larry 
20101223145041.083|20101223145042.880|TR0|Wilkerson, the former chief of 
20101223145042.880|20101223145044.676|TR0|staff of the Secretary of State 
20101223145044.676|20101223145046.472|TR0|Colin Powell, and Dan Ellsberg 
20101223145046.472|20101223145048.268|TR0|and British intelligence 
20101223145048.268|20101223145050.064|TR0|employee Katharine Gun, to a 
20101223145050.064|20101223145051.860|TR0|letter that says WikiLeaks has 
20101223145051.860|20101223145053.656|TR0|teased the genie of transparency 
20101223145053.656|20101223145055.452|TR0|out of a very opaque bottle, and 
20101223145055.452|20101223145057.249|TR0|powerful forces in America who 
20101223145057.249|20101223145059.045|TR0|thrive on secrecy are trying 
20101223145059.045|20101223145100.841|TR0|desperately to stuff the genie 
20101223145100.841|20101223145102.637|TR0|back in. As we wrap up this 
20101223145102.637|20101223145104.433|TR0|discussion, let's end up on 
20101223145104.433|20101223145106.229|TR0|WikiLeaks, Coleen.
20101223145106.229|20101223145108.025|TR0|
20101223145108.025|20101223145109.821|TR0|>> COLEEN ROWLEY: Well, I think 
20101223145109.821|20101223145111.618|TR0|there's a big tie-in between 
20101223145111.618|20101223145113.414|TR0|transparency and knowing what 
20101223145113.414|20101223145115.210|TR0|your government is doing and 
20101223145115.210|20101223145117.006|TR0|what we just heard Mike German 
20101223145117.006|20101223145118.802|TR0|mention, which is these 
20101223145118.802|20101223145120.598|TR0|infiltrations without factual 
20101223145120.598|20101223145122.394|TR0|justification of advocacy 
20101223145122.394|20101223145124.190|TR0|groups. The Minneapolis case 
20101223145124.190|20101223145125.987|TR0|seems to have stemmed a lot from 
20101223145125.987|20101223145127.783|TR0|the lead up to the Republican 
20101223145127.783|20101223145129.579|TR0|National Convention and the 
20101223145129.579|20101223145131.375|TR0|protests, where they simply 
20101223145131.375|20101223145133.171|TR0|targeted protesters. And I think 
20101223145133.171|20101223145134.967|TR0|that if we had more transparency 
20101223145134.967|20101223145136.763|TR0|and we had ways of people 
20101223145136.763|20101223145138.559|TR0|telling the truth about what's 
20101223145138.559|20101223145140.356|TR0|going on, we would not actually 
20101223145140.356|20101223145142.152|TR0|see the - I'm very afraid we're 
20101223145142.152|20101223145143.948|TR0|doomed to repeat that terrible 
20101223145143.948|20101223145145.744|TR0|history of the COINTELPRO era 
20101223145145.744|20101223145147.540|TR0|and the House Un-American

20101223145152.928|20101223145154.725|TR0|going to have to leave it there. 
20101223145154.725|20101223145156.521|TR0|Coleen Rowley and Mike German, 
20101223145156.521|20101223145158.317|TR0|both former FBI agents. Coleen

20101223145214.482|20101223145216.278|TR0|rights movement following a 
20101223145216.278|20101223145218.074|TR0|disappointing week on Capitol 
20101223145218.074|20101223145219.870|TR0|Hill. On Saturday, Senate 
20101223145219.870|20101223145221.666|TR0|Republicans blocked passage of 
20101223145221.666|20101223145223.463|TR0|the DREAM Act, a provision that 
20101223145223.463|20101223145225.259|TR0|would grant undocumented young 
20101223145225.259|20101223145227.055|TR0|people a chance at citizenship. 
20101223145227.055|20101223145228.851|TR0|Under the measure, immigrant 
20101223145228.851|20101223145230.647|TR0|youth would obtain permanent

20101223145232.443|20101223145234.239|TR0|citizenship, provided they 
20101223145234.239|20101223145236.035|TR0|attend college for at least two

20101223145248.608|20101223145250.405|TR0|At his White House news 
20101223145250.405|20101223145252.201|TR0|conference on Wednesday, 
20101223145252.201|20101223145253.997|TR0|President Obama called the DREAM 
20101223145253.997|20101223145255.793|TR0|Act's defeat his "biggest 
20101223145255.793|20101223145257.589|TR0|disappointment."
20101223145257.589|20101223145259.385|TR0|
20101223145259.385|20101223145301.181|TR0|>> PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Maybe 
20101223145301.181|20101223145302.977|TR0|my biggest disappointment was 
20101223145302.977|20101223145304.774|TR0|this DREAM Act vote. You know, I 
20101223145304.774|20101223145306.570|TR0|get letters from kids all across 
20101223145306.570|20101223145308.366|TR0|the country, who came here when 
20101223145308.366|20101223145310.162|TR0|they were five, came here when 
20101223145310.162|20101223145311.958|TR0|they were eight. Their parents 
20101223145311.958|20101223145313.754|TR0|were undocumented. The kids 
20101223145313.754|20101223145315.550|TR0|didn't know. Kids are going to 
20101223145315.550|20101223145317.346|TR0|school like any other American 
20101223145317.346|20101223145319.143|TR0|kid. They're growing up. They're 
20101223145319.143|20101223145320.939|TR0|playing football. They're going 
20101223145320.939|20101223145322.735|TR0|to class. They're dreaming about 
20101223145322.735|20101223145324.531|TR0|college. And suddenly, they come 
20101223145324.531|20101223145326.327|TR0|to 18, 19 years old, and they 
20101223145326.327|20101223145328.123|TR0|realize, "Even though I feel 
20101223145328.123|20101223145329.919|TR0|American, I am an American, the 
20101223145329.919|20101223145331.715|TR0|law doesn't recognize me as an 
20101223145331.715|20101223145333.512|TR0|American. I'm willing to serve 
20101223145333.512|20101223145335.308|TR0|my country. I'm willing to fight 
20101223145335.308|20101223145337.104|TR0|for this country. I want to go 
20101223145337.104|20101223145338.900|TR0|to college and better myself. 
20101223145338.900|20101223145340.696|TR0|And I'm at risk of deportation." 
20101223145340.696|20101223145342.492|TR0|And it is heartbreaking.
20101223145342.492|20101223145344.288|TR0|
20101223145344.288|20101223145346.084|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: The Obama 
20101223145346.084|20101223145347.881|TR0|administration says it will try 
20101223145347.881|20101223145349.677|TR0|to mobilize public support for 
20101223145349.677|20101223145351.473|TR0|the DREAM Act's passage next 
20101223145351.473|20101223145353.269|TR0|year. Speaking to reporters, 
20101223145353.269|20101223145355.065|TR0|White House Communications 
20101223145355.065|20101223145356.861|TR0|Director Dan Pfeiffer said Obama 
20101223145356.861|20101223145358.657|TR0|will "wage a very public 
20101223145358.657|20101223145400.453|TR0|campaign" for the DREAM Act next 
20101223145400.453|20101223145402.250|TR0|year. But the bill's defeat this 
20101223145402.250|20101223145404.046|TR0|week has led many immigrant 
20101223145404.046|20101223145405.842|TR0|rights advocates to openly 
20101223145405.842|20101223145407.638|TR0|question the Obama 
20101223145407.638|20101223145409.434|TR0|administration's immigration 
20101223145409.434|20101223145411.230|TR0|strategy. Over the past two 
20101223145411.230|20101223145413.026|TR0|years, the administration has 
20101223145413.026|20101223145414.822|TR0|deported a record number of 
20101223145414.822|20101223145416.619|TR0|undocumented immigrants but 
20101223145416.619|20101223145418.415|TR0|failed to gain support from 
20101223145418.415|20101223145420.211|TR0|Republicans on any immigration 
20101223145420.211|20101223145422.007|TR0|reform legislation.

20101223145423.803|20101223145425.599|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, to talk 
20101223145425.599|20101223145427.395|TR0|about all of this and where does 
20101223145427.395|20101223145429.191|TR0|the immigrants' rights movement 
20101223145429.191|20101223145430.988|TR0|go next, we're joined by Roberto

20101223145441.764|20101223145443.560|TR0|country's largest immigrant 
20101223145443.560|20101223145445.357|TR0|rights organization, has now 
20101223145445.357|20101223145447.153|TR0|just moved to San Francisco.
20101223145447.153|20101223145448.949|TR0|
20101223145448.949|20101223145450.745|TR0|Roberto, welcome. Where does the 
20101223145450.745|20101223145452.541|TR0|immigrant rights movement go 
20101223145452.541|20101223145454.337|TR0|from here?
20101223145454.337|20101223145456.133|TR0|
20101223145456.133|20101223145457.929|TR0|>> ROBERTO LOVATO: Hi, Amy, Juan.
20101223145457.929|20101223145459.726|TR0|
20101223145459.726|20101223145501.522|TR0|I think the immigrant rights 
20101223145501.522|20101223145503.318|TR0|movement needs to look to what 
20101223145503.318|20101223145505.114|TR0|worked around the vote on the 
20101223145505.114|20101223145506.910|TR0|DREAM Act, which was the 
20101223145506.910|20101223145508.706|TR0|dreamers themselves. In the face 
20101223145508.706|20101223145510.502|TR0|of the nightmare of immigration 
20101223145510.502|20101223145512.298|TR0|enforcement that the Obama 
20101223145512.298|20101223145514.095|TR0|administration has rained upon 
20101223145514.095|20101223145515.891|TR0|immigrants - record-breaking 
20101223145515.891|20101223145517.687|TR0|deportations, detentions, 
20101223145517.687|20101223145519.483|TR0|persecutions, prosecutions, 
20101223145519.483|20101223145521.279|TR0|record-breaking amount of terror 
20101223145521.279|20101223145523.075|TR0|among children and elderly and 
20101223145523.075|20101223145524.871|TR0|families, separation of families 
20101223145524.871|20101223145526.667|TR0|- the young dreamers have taken 
20101223145526.667|20101223145528.464|TR0|a largely zombie and dead 
20101223145528.464|20101223145530.260|TR0|immigrant rights movement that 
20101223145530.260|20101223145532.056|TR0|was focused on something called 
20101223145532.056|20101223145533.852|TR0|comprehensive immigration reform 
20101223145533.852|20101223145535.648|TR0|and pushed people that were 
20101223145535.648|20101223145537.444|TR0|actually opposed to the DREAM 
20101223145537.444|20101223145539.240|TR0|Act or didn't do anything about 
20101223145539.240|20101223145541.036|TR0|it, groups in Washington, D.C. 
20101223145541.036|20101223145542.833|TR0|that are allied to the 
20101223145542.833|20101223145544.629|TR0|Democrats, and forced them to 
20101223145544.629|20101223145546.425|TR0|the point where they almost got 
20101223145546.425|20101223145548.221|TR0|it at five votes - five, 
20101223145548.221|20101223145550.017|TR0|actually, votes, which is the 
20101223145550.017|20101223145551.813|TR0|same amount of Democrats that 
20101223145551.813|20101223145553.609|TR0|didn't support the law.
20101223145553.609|20101223145555.405|TR0|
20101223145555.405|20101223145557.202|TR0|So, the movement needs to be 
20101223145557.202|20101223145558.998|TR0|very clear that the 
20101223145558.998|20101223145600.794|TR0|commander-in-chief of the war on 
20101223145600.794|20101223145602.590|TR0|immigrants is not Joe Arpaio or 
20101223145602.590|20101223145604.386|TR0|Janice Brewer in Arizona, it's 
20101223145604.386|20101223145606.182|TR0|Barack Obama in Washington, D.C. 
20101223145606.182|20101223145607.978|TR0|And so, the degree to which the 
20101223145607.978|20101223145609.774|TR0|movement starts seeing itself as 
20101223145609.774|20101223145611.571|TR0|separate from and pressuring the 
20101223145611.571|20101223145613.367|TR0|Obama administration on 
20101223145613.367|20101223145615.163|TR0|enforcement, because, you know, 
20101223145615.163|20101223145616.959|TR0|people are being terrorized, is 
20101223145616.959|20101223145618.755|TR0|the degree to which that 
20101223145618.755|20101223145620.551|TR0|movement will start changing, 
20101223145620.551|20101223145622.347|TR0|rather than be subsumed and 
20101223145622.347|20101223145624.143|TR0|subjected to the manipulations 
20101223145624.143|20101223145625.940|TR0|of groups in Washington, D.C. 
20101223145625.940|20101223145627.736|TR0|that basically will refuse to 
20101223145627.736|20101223145629.532|TR0|criticize Obama and actually 
20101223145629.532|20101223145631.328|TR0|applaud him for his support of 
20101223145631.328|20101223145633.124|TR0|the DREAM Act while being silent 
20101223145633.124|20101223145634.920|TR0|about that record deportation 
20101223145634.920|20101223145636.716|TR0|and terror that he's foisting.
20101223145636.716|20101223145638.513|TR0|
20101223145638.513|20101223145640.309|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, Roberto, 
20101223145640.309|20101223145642.105|TR0|but what about that, I guess, 
20101223145642.105|20101223145643.901|TR0|internal battle that must be 
20101223145643.901|20101223145645.697|TR0|waged within the immigrant 
20101223145645.697|20101223145647.493|TR0|rights movement, because 
20101223145647.493|20101223145649.289|TR0|obviously many of the national 
20101223145649.289|20101223145651.085|TR0|immigrant rights organizations, 
20101223145651.085|20101223145652.882|TR0|the churches, organizations that 
20101223145652.882|20101223145654.678|TR0|have supported the movement, 
20101223145654.678|20101223145656.474|TR0|some of the trade unions, are 
20101223145656.474|20101223145658.270|TR0|less willing to directly 
20101223145658.270|20101223145700.066|TR0|challenge the President or the 
20101223145700.066|20101223145701.862|TR0|Democratic leadership in 
20101223145701.862|20101223145703.658|TR0|Congress on how hard to push 
20101223145703.658|20101223145705.454|TR0|immigration reform?
20101223145705.454|20101223145707.251|TR0|
20101223145707.251|20101223145709.047|TR0|>> ROBERTO LOVATO: Yeah, that is 
20101223145709.047|20101223145710.843|TR0|the discussion that has to be - 
20101223145710.843|20101223145712.639|TR0|take place, if the movement is 
20101223145712.639|20101223145714.435|TR0|to move out of what I would 
20101223145714.435|20101223145716.231|TR0|call, and many of us are 
20101223145716.231|20101223145718.027|TR0|calling, the humiliated 
20101223145718.027|20101223145719.823|TR0|position, in which we'll 
20101223145719.823|20101223145721.620|TR0|basically take anything as long 
20101223145721.620|20101223145723.416|TR0|as you give us something, OK? 
20101223145723.416|20101223145725.212|TR0|There's studies out of 
20101223145725.212|20101223145727.008|TR0|University of Syracuse and 
20101223145727.008|20101223145728.804|TR0|others, even today's Washington 
20101223145728.804|20101223145730.600|TR0|Post, show how there's been a 
20101223145730.600|20101223145732.396|TR0|systematic increase in the 
20101223145732.396|20101223145734.192|TR0|amount of repression against 
20101223145734.192|20101223145735.989|TR0|immigrants, basically, through 
20101223145735.989|20101223145737.785|TR0|programs like Secure 
20101223145737.785|20101223145739.581|TR0|Communities, record-breaking 
20101223145739.581|20101223145741.377|TR0|repression. Now, if you look at 
20101223145741.377|20101223145743.173|TR0|the press releases coming out of 
20101223145743.173|20101223145744.969|TR0|groups like Center for Community 
20101223145744.969|20101223145746.765|TR0|Change, the National Council of 
20101223145746.765|20101223145748.561|TR0|La Raza, America's Voice, 
20101223145748.561|20101223145750.358|TR0|National Immigration Forum, they 
20101223145750.358|20101223145752.154|TR0|will be mum or very tepid about 
20101223145752.154|20101223145753.950|TR0|criticizing Obama but lauding 
20101223145753.950|20101223145755.746|TR0|him for his leadership on the 
20101223145755.746|20101223145757.542|TR0|DREAM and support for 
20101223145757.542|20101223145759.338|TR0|comprehensive immigration 
20101223145759.338|20101223145801.134|TR0|reform, which is a zombie that 
20101223145801.134|20101223145802.930|TR0|they trot out when the Democrats 
20101223145802.930|20101223145804.727|TR0|need votes. So, there's this 
20101223145804.727|20101223145806.523|TR0|healthy discussion and debate in 
20101223145806.523|20101223145808.319|TR0|the movement right now to 
20101223145808.319|20101223145810.115|TR0|really, really put pressure on 
20101223145810.115|20101223145811.911|TR0|these groups in Washington, 
20101223145811.911|20101223145813.707|TR0|D.C., question them, their 
20101223145813.707|20101223145815.503|TR0|funders, and the Obama 
20101223145815.503|20101223145817.299|TR0|administration for the absolute 
20101223145817.299|20101223145819.096|TR0|failure of comprehensive 
20101223145819.096|20101223145820.892|TR0|immigration reform and the 
20101223145820.892|20101223145822.688|TR0|precarious position it's put 
20101223145822.688|20101223145824.484|TR0|millions of people in in the 
20101223145824.484|20101223145826.280|TR0|United States. I mean, you know, 
20101223145826.280|20101223145828.076|TR0|you just have to step outside of 
20101223145828.076|20101223145829.872|TR0|your television set into the 
20101223145829.872|20101223145831.668|TR0|community and listen to people, 
20101223145831.668|20101223145833.465|TR0|and the disappointment and 
20101223145833.465|20101223145835.261|TR0|disillusion and terror that 
20101223145835.261|20101223145837.057|TR0|people are dealing with right 
20101223145837.057|20101223145838.853|TR0|now.
