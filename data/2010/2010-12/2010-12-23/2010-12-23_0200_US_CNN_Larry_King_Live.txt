20101223020100.000|20101223020103.000|TR0|KING:  Celine Dion is a five-time Grammy 
20101223020103.000|20101223020106.000|TR0|winning singer/songwriter.  One of the

20101223020109.000|20101223020112.000|TR0|history of recording.  She sold more than

20101223020118.000|20101223020121.000|TR0|She heads back to Caesar's Palace in Las 
20101223020121.000|20101223020124.000|TR0|Vegas in March.  And we're thrilled to 
20101223020124.000|20101223020127.000|TR0|welcome her once again to LARRY KING LIVE 
20101223020127.000|20101223020130.000|TR0|from her home in West Palm Beach, where 
20101223020130.000|20101223020133.000|TR0|she is nestled in with her new set of twin

20101223020139.000|20101223020142.000|TR0|What's it like?  How are they doing?

20101223020145.000|20101223020147.000|TR0|CELINE DION, GRAMMY WINNING 
20101223020147.000|20101223020150.000|TR0|SINGER/SONGWRITER:  Well, the weather here 
20101223020150.000|20101223020153.000|TR0|is very cold but I tell you, my twins and

20101223020156.000|20101223020159.000|TR0|they're keeping me warm, so that's the 
20101223020159.000|20101223020202.000|TR0|spirit of the holidays.
20101223020202.000|20101223020205.000|TR0|
20101223020205.000|20101223020208.000|TR0|It's so wonderful.  It's just amazing to 
20101223020208.000|20101223020211.000|TR0|have all that love and it's wonderful to 
20101223020211.000|20101223020214.000|TR0|talk to you as well, Larry.
20101223020214.000|20101223020217.000|TR0|
20101223020217.000|20101223020220.000|TR0|KING:  When you were on this show in 
20101223020220.000|20101223020223.000|TR0|February, you said you and your husband, 
20101223020223.000|20101223020226.000|TR0|Rene, great friend, would love to have 
20101223020226.000|20101223020229.000|TR0|another child. And you were trying.  It 
20101223020229.000|20101223020232.000|TR0|turns out you may have been -- you may 
20101223020232.000|20101223020235.000|TR0|have gotten pregnant right after that show.
20101223020235.000|20101223020238.000|TR0|
20101223020238.000|20101223020241.000|TR0|DION:  That's right.  We had tried time 
20101223020241.000|20101223020244.000|TR0|after -- we've tried five times before 
20101223020244.000|20101223020247.000|TR0|this last try that worked out.  And I 
20101223020247.000|20101223020250.000|TR0|guess when you try and you believe and you 
20101223020250.000|20101223020253.000|TR0|just -- we just kept trying.  And we were 
20101223020253.000|20101223020256.000|TR0|blessed twice.  And it's just amazing to 
20101223020256.000|20101223020259.000|TR0|have my 9 1/2-year-old beautiful boy and 
20101223020259.000|20101223020302.000|TR0|now we waited so long to have -- and hoped 
20101223020302.000|20101223020305.000|TR0|for another child and we were blessed -- 
20101223020305.000|20101223020308.000|TR0|double blessed.
20101223020308.000|20101223020311.000|TR0|
20101223020311.000|20101223020314.000|TR0|And it's just extraordinary to be parents 
20101223020314.000|20101223020317.000|TR0|again and it's such a blessing.  And 
20101223020317.000|20101223020320.000|TR0|they're doing -- Nelson and Eddie are 
20101223020320.000|20101223020323.000|TR0|doing really well.  And they're 6 weeks 
20101223020323.000|20101223020325.000|TR0|old.  And I still look at them and I still 
20101223020325.000|20101223020328.000|TR0|can't believe it.  I can't believe it.
20101223020328.000|20101223020331.000|TR0|
20101223020331.000|20101223020334.000|TR0|KING:  You named Nelson after Mandela, is 
20101223020334.000|20101223020337.000|TR0|that right?
20101223020337.000|20101223020340.000|TR0|
20101223020340.000|20101223020343.000|TR0|DION:  That's right, Larry.  I did because 
20101223020343.000|20101223020346.000|TR0|-- we did actually. When we knew that we 
20101223020346.000|20101223020349.000|TR0|were going on this last tour, go to South 
20101223020349.000|20101223020352.000|TR0|Africa, started the tour there almost two 
20101223020352.000|20101223020355.000|TR0|years ago now already, I knew that we were 
20101223020355.000|20101223020358.000|TR0|going to South Africa and we hoped to meet 
20101223020358.000|20101223020401.000|TR0|with Mr. Mandela. And we did.
20101223020401.000|20101223020404.000|TR0|
20101223020404.000|20101223020407.000|TR0|And I wanted to take a little course of 
20101223020407.000|20101223020410.000|TR0|history, of course, before we left because 
20101223020410.000|20101223020413.000|TR0|I wanted to know about the apartheid and I 
20101223020413.000|20101223020416.000|TR0|wanted to know how great of a hero he was. 
20101223020416.000|20101223020419.000|TR0| And I wanted to know what he did better.  
20101223020419.000|20101223020422.000|TR0|And so I met with a teacher and I learned 
20101223020422.000|20101223020425.000|TR0|about -- much more.
20101223020425.000|20101223020428.000|TR0|
20101223020428.000|20101223020431.000|TR0|And so when I met with Mr. Mandela, my mom 
20101223020431.000|20101223020434.000|TR0|was there, Rene was there, Rene's son 
20101223020434.000|20101223020437.000|TR0|Patrick was there.  Our son Rene-Charles 
20101223020437.000|20101223020440.000|TR0|was there. And it was such an impact to 
20101223020440.000|20101223020443.000|TR0|meet with him.  What a hero.  What a 
20101223020443.000|20101223020446.000|TR0|difference he made.  And we decided to 
20101223020446.000|20101223020449.000|TR0|name one of our sons after Nelson Mandela.
20101223020449.000|20101223020452.000|TR0|
20101223020452.000|20101223020455.000|TR0|And for Eddie, that was another hero of 
20101223020455.000|20101223020458.000|TR0|our lives as well.  Eddie Marnay was a 
20101223020458.000|20101223020501.000|TR0|French lyricist who wrote five of my 
20101223020501.000|20101223020503.000|TR0|French albums and he also wrote for Edith 
20101223020503.000|20101223020506.000|TR0|Piaf and Barbra Streisand and many, many 
20101223020506.000|20101223020509.000|TR0|wonderful singers.  And -- so two heroes 
20101223020509.000|20101223020512.000|TR0|in our lives.  And we wanted our boys to 
20101223020512.000|20101223020515.000|TR0|grow and say, you know, we're named after 
20101223020515.000|20101223020518.000|TR0|wonderful people.  So that's --
20101223020518.000|20101223020521.000|TR0|
20101223020521.000|20101223020524.000|TR0|KING:  Early in --
20101223020524.000|20101223020527.000|TR0|
20101223020527.000|20101223020530.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20101223020530.000|20101223020533.000|TR0|
20101223020533.000|20101223020536.000|TR0|KING:  Early in your pregnancy, it was 
20101223020536.000|20101223020539.000|TR0|triplets, right?
20101223020539.000|20101223020542.000|TR0|
20101223020542.000|20101223020545.000|TR0|DION:  Yes, there was three babies, that's 
20101223020545.000|20101223020548.000|TR0|right, yes.  And nature took its course.  
20101223020548.000|20101223020551.000|TR0|And one little baby just decided to step 
20101223020551.000|20101223020554.000|TR0|back to give the two others a chance to 
20101223020554.000|20101223020557.000|TR0|survive very well.  And you never want to 
20101223020557.000|20101223020600.000|TR0|have -- to have -- wanting to make a 
20101223020600.000|20101223020603.000|TR0|choice -- to make a decision if something 
20101223020603.000|20101223020606.000|TR0|goes wrong, for example, with a pregnancy, 
20101223020606.000|20101223020609.000|TR0|you never want to be put, like, forward 
20101223020609.000|20101223020612.000|TR0|and have to take a decision and put an end 
20101223020612.000|20101223020615.000|TR0|to something.
20101223020615.000|20101223020618.000|TR0|
20101223020618.000|20101223020621.000|TR0|So if there was -- the doctor said to me, 
20101223020621.000|20101223020624.000|TR0|if there was something wrong, you know 
20101223020624.000|20101223020627.000|TR0|sometimes when something wrong with a baby 
20101223020627.000|20101223020630.000|TR0|the baby decides by itself and nature 
20101223020630.000|20101223020633.000|TR0|takes its course and it puts an end to it. 
20101223020633.000|20101223020636.000|TR0| So we don't know what happened.  We're 
20101223020636.000|20101223020639.000|TR0|not trying to find out.
20101223020639.000|20101223020642.000|TR0|
20101223020642.000|20101223020644.000|TR0|One little baby decided to step back.  But 
20101223020644.000|20101223020647.000|TR0|you just have to look forward.  And -- but 
20101223020647.000|20101223020650.000|TR0|you still miss -- I still think about the 
20101223020650.000|20101223020653.000|TR0|one that stepped back and just -- is not 
20101223020653.000|20101223020656.000|TR0|here today.  You always think of that.  
20101223020656.000|20101223020659.000|TR0|I'm sure every woman who has that 
20101223020659.000|20101223020702.000|TR0|experience still has a feeling about the 
20101223020702.000|20101223020705.000|TR0|little one that's not -- that's not there.
20101223020705.000|20101223020708.000|TR0|
20101223020708.000|20101223020711.000|TR0|KING:  You tried in vitro so many times 
20101223020711.000|20101223020714.000|TR0|unsuccessfully.  Did you ever think of 
20101223020714.000|20101223020717.000|TR0|giving it up?
20101223020717.000|20101223020720.000|TR0|
20101223020720.000|20101223020723.000|TR0|DION:  We tried many, many times.  And 
20101223020723.000|20101223020726.000|TR0|that was the sixth try. And then I have to 
20101223020726.000|20101223020729.000|TR0|say that many times that I asked myself 
20101223020729.000|20101223020732.000|TR0|when am I going to end?  When am I going 
20101223020732.000|20101223020735.000|TR0|to stop?  What's going to tell me that I 
20101223020735.000|20101223020738.000|TR0|need to put an end to that?  Because when 
20101223020738.000|20101223020741.000|TR0|you try three times and four times, it's 
20101223020741.000|20101223020744.000|TR0|like, am I going to go forward, we 
20101223020744.000|20101223020747.000|TR0|questioned ourselves many times.
20101223020747.000|20101223020750.000|TR0|
20101223020750.000|20101223020753.000|TR0|But I guess it's nature itself.  Until -- 
20101223020753.000|20101223020756.000|TR0|we are women and we can be pregnant and we 
20101223020756.000|20101223020759.000|TR0|can have babies, then you keep -- you 
20101223020759.000|20101223020802.000|TR0|still want to keep going.  And then one 
20101223020802.000|20101223020805.000|TR0|day this is the beginning of something 
20101223020805.000|20101223020808.000|TR0|else or an end for something.  And then 
20101223020808.000|20101223020811.000|TR0|this is your answer for you to stop.  So 
20101223020811.000|20101223020814.000|TR0|-- but I'm not there yet I guess.  So we 
20101223020814.000|20101223020817.000|TR0|were blessed.

20101223020820.000|20101223020822.000|TR0|KING:  She'll be in Vegas again in March.  
20101223020822.000|20101223020825.000|TR0|What a show that is, by the way.  And 
20101223020825.000|20101223020828.000|TR0|we'll be right back with Celine Dion.  
20101223020828.000|20101223020831.000|TR0|Don't go away.

20101223020840.000|20101223020843.000|TR0|KING:  Those clips are from "Through the 
20101223020843.000|20101223020846.000|TR0|Eyes of the World," that terrific 
20101223020846.000|20101223020849.000|TR0|documentary that followed Celine 
20101223020849.000|20101223020852.000|TR0|everywhere.  She is featured -- she and 
20101223020852.000|20101223020855.000|TR0|the twins and showcased, in fact, in the 
20101223020855.000|20101223020858.000|TR0|edition of "People" magazine that hits the

20101223020904.000|20101223020907.000|TR0|There's obviously an intense public 
20101223020907.000|20101223020910.000|TR0|curiosity about you and the kids.  How do 
20101223020910.000|20101223020913.000|TR0|you decide how much you'll share?

20101223020916.000|20101223020919.000|TR0|DION:  I'll leave it to Rene.  First of 
20101223020919.000|20101223020922.000|TR0|all, as people know, I'm an open book.  I 
20101223020922.000|20101223020925.000|TR0|have shared my whole life.  My private and 
20101223020925.000|20101223020928.000|TR0|my show business life.  It helps me 
20101223020928.000|20101223020931.000|TR0|actually to feel my songs and to go on 
20101223020931.000|20101223020934.000|TR0|with my dreams.
20101223020934.000|20101223020937.000|TR0|
20101223020937.000|20101223020940.000|TR0|But how much to share?  I think I leave it 
20101223020940.000|20101223020943.000|TR0|to Rene.  I trust him. I love him.  He's 
20101223020943.000|20101223020946.000|TR0|been my leader in my career, as well as 
20101223020946.000|20101223020949.000|TR0|the leader of my heart, and it's trust.  
20101223020949.000|20101223020952.000|TR0|And we share an amazing relationship 
20101223020952.000|20101223020955.000|TR0|together.  For that part, I leave it up to 
20101223020955.000|20101223020958.000|TR0|him.
20101223020958.000|20101223021000.000|TR0|
20101223021000.000|20101223021003.000|TR0|KING:  Are the twins identical of -- are 
20101223021003.000|20101223021006.000|TR0|they identical or fraternal?
20101223021006.000|20101223021009.000|TR0|
20101223021009.000|20101223021012.000|TR0|DION:  Actually, they're not identical at 
20101223021012.000|20101223021015.000|TR0|all.  When they were born, they were 
20101223021015.000|20101223021018.000|TR0|actually separate.  But in their two 
20101223021018.000|20101223021021.000|TR0|little homes. But I couldn't -- I couldn't 
20101223021021.000|20101223021024.000|TR0|see the difference.  I was like, oh, my 
20101223021024.000|20101223021027.000|TR0|gosh, and we don't even have names.  I'm 
20101223021027.000|20101223021030.000|TR0|going to say baby A, baby B for how long?
20101223021030.000|20101223021033.000|TR0|
20101223021033.000|20101223021036.000|TR0|I was like confused.  Who's baby A?  But 
20101223021036.000|20101223021039.000|TR0|this is where -- we mixed the hats.  Oh, 
20101223021039.000|20101223021042.000|TR0|my god, baby A is not baby B.  And B is A. 
20101223021042.000|20101223021045.000|TR0| I was like -- we were all confused.  And 
20101223021045.000|20101223021048.000|TR0|after coming home, Rene says, I know how 
20101223021048.000|20101223021051.000|TR0|important choosing names.  It's such a 
20101223021051.000|20101223021054.000|TR0|responsibility to choose names.
20101223021054.000|20101223021057.000|TR0|
20101223021057.000|20101223021100.000|TR0|We have to have names.  I said, I know, I 
20101223021100.000|20101223021103.000|TR0|know.  So after about a week or so, we 
20101223021103.000|20101223021106.000|TR0|couldn't take it anymore.  So we sat down. 
20101223021106.000|20101223021109.000|TR0| And we said, OK, it's going to be our two 
20101223021109.000|20101223021112.000|TR0|heroes here, Nelson and Eddie.  So 
20101223021112.000|20101223021115.000|TR0|Rene-Charles, Nelson and Eddie.  We're 
20101223021115.000|20101223021118.000|TR0|suiting our family.  We're very proud.  
20101223021118.000|20101223021121.000|TR0|And here we are.
20101223021121.000|20101223021124.000|TR0|
20101223021124.000|20101223021127.000|TR0|KING:  Are you getting a lot of sleep?
20101223021127.000|20101223021130.000|TR0|
20101223021130.000|20101223021133.000|TR0|DION:  Excuse me?
20101223021133.000|20101223021136.000|TR0|
20101223021136.000|20101223021139.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20101223021139.000|20101223021141.000|TR0|
20101223021141.000|20101223021144.000|TR0|DION:  No sleep at all.  It's pretty 
20101223021144.000|20101223021147.000|TR0|amazing how we can survive with no sleep.  
20101223021147.000|20101223021150.000|TR0|Actually, my little boy right now, 
20101223021150.000|20101223021153.000|TR0|Rene-Charles, has a little -- he's a 
20101223021153.000|20101223021156.000|TR0|little sick, he's got a little fever and 
20101223021156.000|20101223021159.000|TR0|he's got some stuff going on, so I want to 
20101223021159.000|20101223021202.000|TR0|be there and I want to take care of him 
20101223021202.000|20101223021205.000|TR0|and at the same time we're breastfeeding 
20101223021205.000|20101223021208.000|TR0|the babies every 2 1/2 hours.
20101223021208.000|20101223021211.000|TR0|
20101223021211.000|20101223021214.000|TR0|And no, let me -- let me rephrase that, we 
20101223021214.000|20101223021217.000|TR0|are not breastfeeding the baby.  I am 
20101223021217.000|20101223021220.000|TR0|breastfeeding the babies.  So it's like 
20101223021220.000|20101223021223.000|TR0|there's not a lot of sleep.  Every 2 1/2 
20101223021223.000|20101223021226.000|TR0|hours.  And then we're not counting the 
20101223021226.000|20101223021229.000|TR0|rest.  I mean, sometimes I have 25 minutes 
20101223021229.000|20101223021232.000|TR0|left.  Do I shower, do I eat or do I 
20101223021232.000|20101223021235.000|TR0|sleep?  It's up to me.
20101223021235.000|20101223021238.000|TR0|
20101223021238.000|20101223021241.000|TR0|It's still up to me for that part.  But 
20101223021241.000|20101223021244.000|TR0|it's a great challenge. It's very, very 
20101223021244.000|20101223021247.000|TR0|tiring.  It's full of surprises.  But it's 
20101223021247.000|20101223021250.000|TR0|all with love.  And it's all amazing.  All 
20101223021250.000|20101223021253.000|TR0|day, I'm in my pajamas.  Sometimes I 
20101223021253.000|20101223021256.000|TR0|forget to really close it well.  So it's 
20101223021256.000|20101223021259.000|TR0|-- it's overwhelming.  In a good way.  In 
20101223021259.000|20101223021302.000|TR0|a good way.  But there's no sleep yet.
20101223021302.000|20101223021305.000|TR0|
20101223021305.000|20101223021308.000|TR0|KING:  How is Rene-Charles adjusting to 
20101223021308.000|20101223021311.000|TR0|his little brothers?  How is he adjusting 
20101223021311.000|20101223021314.000|TR0|to his little brothers?
20101223021314.000|20101223021317.000|TR0|
20101223021317.000|20101223021319.000|TR0|DION:  It's quite funny and interesting at 
20101223021319.000|20101223021322.000|TR0|the same time because a lot -- everybody's 
20101223021322.000|20101223021325.000|TR0|asking us that question obviously.  But 
20101223021325.000|20101223021328.000|TR0|people think probably that he's like, oh, 
20101223021328.000|20101223021331.000|TR0|my goodness, your brothers, can I hold 
20101223021331.000|20101223021334.000|TR0|them, can I hold them?
20101223021334.000|20101223021337.000|TR0|
20101223021337.000|20101223021340.000|TR0|I don't think it's there yet.  I think 
20101223021340.000|20101223021343.000|TR0|R.C.'s looking at them and it's like, mom, 
20101223021343.000|20101223021346.000|TR0|the only thing they do is, like, these 
20101223021346.000|20101223021349.000|TR0|type of things. They look up.  They look 
20101223021349.000|20101223021352.000|TR0|down.  They cry and all that.  So he's 
20101223021352.000|20101223021355.000|TR0|trying to make faces to make them laugh.  
20101223021355.000|20101223021358.000|TR0|And they kind of look.  And I say to R.C., 
20101223021358.000|20101223021401.000|TR0|they're just starting to see.  Colors is 
20101223021401.000|20101223021404.000|TR0|just coming now.
20101223021404.000|20101223021407.000|TR0|
20101223021407.000|20101223021410.000|TR0|And he's like, I think he's looking 
20101223021410.000|20101223021413.000|TR0|forward to play with them. So they're not 
20101223021413.000|20101223021416.000|TR0|talking about baseball yet.  But very soon 
20101223021416.000|20101223021419.000|TR0|it will happen.  So R.C.'s very 
20101223021419.000|20101223021422.000|TR0|interested, obviously, in them.  But he's 
20101223021422.000|20101223021425.000|TR0|looking for them, this is Nelson, this is 
20101223021425.000|20101223021428.000|TR0|Eddie.  Mom, are they OK? He's trying to 
20101223021428.000|20101223021431.000|TR0|make them laugh.  But right now I think 
20101223021431.000|20101223021434.000|TR0|he's looking forward and he can't wait for 
20101223021434.000|20101223021437.000|TR0|them to throw the ball.
20101223021437.000|20101223021440.000|TR0|
20101223021440.000|20101223021443.000|TR0|KING:  When we come back, we'll talk about 
20101223021443.000|20101223021446.000|TR0|her return to Las Vegas.  Celine Dion, our

20101223021500.000|20101223021503.000|TR0|in a room built for her at Caesar's 
20101223021503.000|20101223021506.000|TR0|Palace.  The new show premieres March 15th.
20101223021506.000|20101223021509.000|TR0|
20101223021509.000|20101223021512.000|TR0|Excited about that?
20101223021512.000|20101223021515.000|TR0|
20101223021515.000|20101223021518.000|TR0|DION:  I'm very excited.  It's wonderful 
20101223021518.000|20101223021521.000|TR0|to be wanted and to be loved again.  It is 
20101223021521.000|20101223021524.000|TR0|wonderful to go back home again.  If I may 
20101223021524.000|20101223021527.000|TR0|say this way.  So -- and it's always 
20101223021527.000|20101223021530.000|TR0|exciting.  We know we've had a lot of 
20101223021530.000|20101223021533.000|TR0|meetings and get-together a few months 
20101223021533.000|20101223021536.000|TR0|back with all the wonderful people 
20101223021536.000|20101223021539.000|TR0|involved in the new show.
20101223021539.000|20101223021542.000|TR0|
20101223021542.000|20101223021545.000|TR0|And Ken Erlich will be the director of the 
20101223021545.000|20101223021548.000|TR0|show who's been doing the Grammys, you 
20101223021548.000|20101223021551.000|TR0|know, for more than 30 years.  And 
20101223021551.000|20101223021554.000|TR0|actually, it's just wonderful to get ideas 
20101223021554.000|20101223021557.000|TR0|again.  Every time you think, I'm going to 
20101223021557.000|20101223021600.000|TR0|run out of ideas at one point but no, 
20101223021600.000|20101223021603.000|TR0|everybody gets together, and we have ideas 
20101223021603.000|20101223021606.000|TR0|and we're going to be with 31 musicians on 
20101223021606.000|20101223021609.000|TR0|stage and, for me, I mean, there's much 
20101223021609.000|20101223021612.000|TR0|more than that, but just this itself.
20101223021612.000|20101223021615.000|TR0|
20101223021615.000|20101223021618.000|TR0|Thirty-one musicians for a singer, it's a 
20101223021618.000|20101223021621.000|TR0|dream come true.  I mean, you might have 
20101223021621.000|20101223021624.000|TR0|that once in a while in a recording 
20101223021624.000|20101223021627.000|TR0|studio.  But every night on stage with 
20101223021627.000|20101223021630.000|TR0|you?  It's going to be hard for me to 
20101223021630.000|20101223021633.000|TR0|spend my time like not looking back too 
20101223021633.000|20101223021636.000|TR0|many times.  You know to have my back 
20101223021636.000|20101223021638.000|TR0|against the people and go back and notice 
20101223021638.000|20101223021641.000|TR0|the crowd and the same time as all those 
20101223021641.000|20101223021644.000|TR0|wonderful orchestra.
20101223021644.000|20101223021647.000|TR0|
20101223021647.000|20101223021650.000|TR0|So I'm looking forward to go back and 
20101223021650.000|20101223021653.000|TR0|perform again.  I'm thrilled.  And there's 
20101223021653.000|20101223021656.000|TR0|going to be a lot of surprises and effects 
20101223021656.000|20101223021659.000|TR0|and I'm very, very happy.
20101223021659.000|20101223021702.000|TR0|
20101223021702.000|20101223021705.000|TR0|KING:  Yes.  Does the stage still slope 
20101223021705.000|20101223021708.000|TR0|down?  Are you going to fly again?
20101223021708.000|20101223021711.000|TR0|
20101223021711.000|20101223021714.000|TR0|(LAUGHTER)
20101223021714.000|20101223021717.000|TR0|
20101223021717.000|20101223021720.000|TR0|DION:  No way.  I'm not going on the ski 
20101223021720.000|20101223021723.000|TR0|slope again for -- that's it.  I've had 
20101223021723.000|20101223021726.000|TR0|five years of that.  It was magnificent.  
20101223021726.000|20101223021729.000|TR0|But it's been very, very difficult for the 
20101223021729.000|20101223021732.000|TR0|spine, for the neck, for the body, for the 
20101223021732.000|20101223021735.000|TR0|voice itself actually.
20101223021735.000|20101223021738.000|TR0|
20101223021738.000|20101223021741.000|TR0|So no, actually, when I ended Las Vegas 
20101223021741.000|20101223021744.000|TR0|with "A New Day," they had put it back 
20101223021744.000|20101223021747.000|TR0|straight.  So they kept it straight.  And 
20101223021747.000|20101223021750.000|TR0|we made sure they did.  And I'm looking 
20101223021750.000|20101223021753.000|TR0|forward to perform on a flat and smooth 
20101223021753.000|20101223021756.000|TR0|surface.  I'm looking forward to 
20101223021756.000|20101223021759.000|TR0|experience that.
20101223021759.000|20101223021802.000|TR0|
20101223021802.000|20101223021805.000|TR0|KING:  Does the show have a concept?
20101223021805.000|20101223021808.000|TR0|
20101223021808.000|20101223021811.000|TR0|DION:  Well, it's going to be much more -- 
20101223021811.000|20101223021814.000|TR0|I kind of feel that it's more about music 
20101223021814.000|20101223021816.000|TR0|itself.  Not that we didn't do that 
20101223021816.000|20101223021819.000|TR0|before. It's putting more emphasis on big 
20101223021819.000|20101223021822.000|TR0|orchestra, music, musicians, singers, 
20101223021822.000|20101223021825.000|TR0|songs.  We want to do music at the purest 
20101223021825.000|20101223021828.000|TR0|as possible, like the old days I guess.  
20101223021828.000|20101223021831.000|TR0|So if it's a concept --
20101223021831.000|20101223021834.000|TR0|
20101223021834.000|20101223021837.000|TR0|KING:  How about costume --
20101223021837.000|20101223021840.000|TR0|
20101223021840.000|20101223021843.000|TR0|DION:  I think it is.
20101223021843.000|20101223021846.000|TR0|
20101223021846.000|20101223021849.000|TR0|KING:  How about costume -- costume 
20101223021849.000|20101223021852.000|TR0|changes?       DION:  Well, about costumes 
20101223021852.000|20101223021855.000|TR0|-- yes, I think people like to see artists 
20101223021855.000|20101223021858.000|TR0|change in different outfits.  Again, it's 
20101223021858.000|20101223021901.000|TR0|a -- you have to be careful with that.  
20101223021901.000|20101223021904.000|TR0|People want you to change.  They want to 
20101223021904.000|20101223021907.000|TR0|see outfits.  And if you change too much, 
20101223021907.000|20101223021910.000|TR0|they say it's too much.  And if you change 
20101223021910.000|20101223021913.000|TR0|too little, they say it's not enough.
20101223021913.000|20101223021916.000|TR0|
20101223021916.000|20101223021919.000|TR0|So you have to change just enough.  You 
20101223021919.000|20101223021922.000|TR0|can't please everybody. But I have a 
20101223021922.000|20101223021925.000|TR0|wonderful stylist, Annie Horth, that I'm 
20101223021925.000|20101223021928.000|TR0|going to be working with again and who 
20101223021928.000|20101223021931.000|TR0|will make sure that we can please as many 
20101223021931.000|20101223021934.000|TR0|people as possible.  But you know me with 
20101223021934.000|20101223021937.000|TR0|fashion.  I enjoy that very, very much.  
20101223021937.000|20101223021940.000|TR0|So I will try to change, not too little 
20101223021940.000|20101223021943.000|TR0|and not too much.
20101223021943.000|20101223021946.000|TR0|
20101223021946.000|20101223021949.000|TR0|Hopefully I'll have my shape again.  But 
20101223021949.000|20101223021952.000|TR0|I'm not very worried about that.  First 
20101223021952.000|20101223021954.000|TR0|thing first, the health of the children.  
20101223021954.000|20101223021957.000|TR0|And I'm sure Annie will find the perfect 
20101223021957.000|20101223022000.000|TR0|dress for the perfect size for the moment 
20101223022000.000|20101223022003.000|TR0|that I will be in.
20101223022003.000|20101223022006.000|TR0|
20101223022006.000|20101223022009.000|TR0|KING:  She's one of the great performers 
20101223022009.000|20101223022012.000|TR0|in the world.  Celine Dion.  Returning to 
20101223022012.000|20101223022015.000|TR0|Vegas in March of next year on a 
20101223022015.000|20101223022018.000|TR0|three-year contracted run.
20101223022018.000|20101223022021.000|TR0|
20101223022021.000|20101223022024.000|TR0|We'll be back with Celine after this.
20101223022024.000|20101223022027.000|TR0|
20101223022027.000|20101223022030.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20101223022030.000|20101223022033.000|TR0|
20101223022033.000|20101223022036.000|TR0|KING:  We're back with Celine Dion.
20101223022036.000|20101223022039.000|TR0|
20101223022039.000|20101223022042.000|TR0|I imagine Vegas is much easier than that 
20101223022042.000|20101223022045.000|TR0|tour you did.
20101223022045.000|20101223022048.000|TR0|
20101223022048.000|20101223022051.000|TR0|DION:  Well, it's very different, that's 
20101223022051.000|20101223022054.000|TR0|for sure.  The energy is very different.  
20101223022054.000|20101223022057.000|TR0|I have to say that when you tour the 
20101223022057.000|20101223022100.000|TR0|world, obviously, the jetlags and 
20101223022100.000|20101223022103.000|TR0|different hours and ways of living and 
20101223022103.000|20101223022106.000|TR0|traveling, a lot of hours in the plane, 
20101223022106.000|20101223022109.000|TR0|and you wake up in the morning and you're 
20101223022109.000|20101223022112.000|TR0|not quite sure where you are, and it is 
20101223022112.000|20101223022115.000|TR0|very tiring.
20101223022115.000|20101223022118.000|TR0|
20101223022118.000|20101223022121.000|TR0|It takes longer to get to a place.  But it 
20101223022121.000|20101223022124.000|TR0|was so well put together, so well done, 
20101223022124.000|20101223022127.000|TR0|and it gives you a chance as well to see 
20101223022127.000|20101223022130.000|TR0|the world.  I was so proud to have my mom 
20101223022130.000|20101223022132.000|TR0|and my son to see the world and do safaris 
20101223022132.000|20101223022135.000|TR0|and visit museums and -- I mean, see 
20101223022135.000|20101223022138.000|TR0|different livings, and it was just a big 
20101223022138.000|20101223022141.000|TR0|thrill and a great, great chance for all 
20101223022141.000|20101223022144.000|TR0|of us.
20101223022144.000|20101223022147.000|TR0|
20101223022147.000|20101223022150.000|TR0|It made all of us I think grow very well.  
20101223022150.000|20101223022153.000|TR0|But as well, to be stable in one place, 
20101223022153.000|20101223022156.000|TR0|it's also another great opportunity when 
20101223022156.000|20101223022159.000|TR0|you can leave your family home, knowing 
20101223022159.000|20101223022202.000|TR0|that when your kids are small they can 
20101223022202.000|20101223022205.000|TR0|have stability.  So think R.C., my child, 
20101223022205.000|20101223022208.000|TR0|was very -- was old enough to see the 
20101223022208.000|20101223022211.000|TR0|world, but right now for my little two new 
20101223022211.000|20101223022214.000|TR0|kids on the block, should I say, it would 
20101223022214.000|20101223022217.000|TR0|be -- it's perfect right now.
20101223022217.000|20101223022220.000|TR0|
20101223022220.000|20101223022223.000|TR0|So I can't pick -- I can't pick one thing 
20101223022223.000|20101223022226.000|TR0|that's better than another.  It's just two 
20101223022226.000|20101223022229.000|TR0|different energies.  It's like an up tempo 
20101223022229.000|20101223022232.000|TR0|song and a ballad, for example.
20101223022232.000|20101223022235.000|TR0|
20101223022235.000|20101223022238.000|TR0|KING:  Back with our remaining moments 
20101223022238.000|20101223022241.000|TR0|with the great Celine Dion right after 
20101223022241.000|20101223022244.000|TR0|this.
20101223022244.000|20101223022247.000|TR0|
20101223022247.000|20101223022250.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)     KING:  Thirty years 
20101223022250.000|20101223022253.000|TR0|ago tonight, who could forget it, John 
20101223022253.000|20101223022256.000|TR0|Lennon died.
20101223022256.000|20101223022259.000|TR0|
20101223022259.000|20101223022302.000|TR0|What are your thoughts about him?  The 
20101223022302.000|20101223022305.000|TR0|Beatles, that whole era?
20101223022305.000|20101223022308.000|TR0|
20101223022308.000|20101223022311.000|TR0|DION:  What a legend.  What a man.  And 
20101223022311.000|20101223022313.000|TR0|it's so unfortunate what happened.  And 
20101223022313.000|20101223022316.000|TR0|it's amazing because 30 years ago, like 
20101223022316.000|20101223022319.000|TR0|you said, he was killed, and it's amazing 
20101223022319.000|20101223022322.000|TR0|because today Rene and I were talking 
20101223022322.000|20101223022325.000|TR0|together about him, and I was 12 years old 
20101223022325.000|20101223022328.000|TR0|when he was -- when he was killed.
20101223022328.000|20101223022331.000|TR0|
20101223022331.000|20101223022334.000|TR0|But fortunately, through his amazing music 
20101223022334.000|20101223022337.000|TR0|and through my family, my brothers and 
20101223022337.000|20101223022340.000|TR0|sisters and my husband, I have learned his 
20101223022340.000|20101223022343.000|TR0|music and his words, and so I kind of grew 
20101223022343.000|20101223022346.000|TR0|a little later with him.
20101223022346.000|20101223022349.000|TR0|
20101223022349.000|20101223022352.000|TR0|But he's part of my life, and we were 
20101223022352.000|20101223022355.000|TR0|talking a lot about him today, and it's 
20101223022355.000|20101223022358.000|TR0|just like -- I remember that 40 -- 40 
20101223022358.000|20101223022401.000|TR0|years ago he wrote an amazing, amazing 
20101223022401.000|20101223022404.000|TR0|song called "Imagine."  And we've been 
20101223022404.000|20101223022407.000|TR0|singing that song today in the house, and 
20101223022407.000|20101223022410.000|TR0|it's just so unfortunate, you know.  But 
20101223022410.000|20101223022413.000|TR0|he's --
20101223022413.000|20101223022416.000|TR0|
20101223022416.000|20101223022419.000|TR0|KING:  Want to do a little --
20101223022419.000|20101223022422.000|TR0|
20101223022422.000|20101223022425.000|TR0|DION:  Because of his great, great talent.
20101223022425.000|20101223022428.000|TR0|
20101223022428.000|20101223022431.000|TR0|KING:  Want to do a little for us?
20101223022431.000|20101223022434.000|TR0|
20101223022434.000|20101223022437.000|TR0|DION:  He lives inside of all of us in a 
20101223022437.000|20101223022440.000|TR0|way, you know, still.
20101223022440.000|20101223022443.000|TR0|
20101223022443.000|20101223022446.000|TR0|KING:  Why don't you do a little for us?
20101223022446.000|20101223022449.000|TR0|
20101223022449.000|20101223022451.000|TR0|DION:  I knew you were going to ask me to 
20101223022451.000|20101223022454.000|TR0|sing.  But I'm certainly glad because I 
20101223022454.000|20101223022457.000|TR0|love to sing for you and for the people.  
20101223022457.000|20101223022500.000|TR0|All right.  Well, if I may sing "Imagine" 
20101223022500.000|20101223022503.000|TR0|then.
20101223022503.000|20101223022506.000|TR0|
20101223022506.000|20101223022509.000|TR0|(SINGING)
20101223022509.000|20101223022512.000|TR0|
20101223022512.000|20101223022515.000|TR0|KING:  You're incredible.  You are an 
20101223022515.000|20101223022518.000|TR0|incredible, incredible lady.  It's an 
20101223022518.000|20101223022521.000|TR0|honor -- honor knowing you.  I wish good 
20101223022521.000|20101223022524.000|TR0|health to the little boys and to Rene.  
20101223022524.000|20101223022527.000|TR0|Give my best to your great husband.
20101223022527.000|20101223022530.000|TR0|
20101223022530.000|20101223022533.000|TR0|DION:  Thank you so much, Larry.
20101223022533.000|20101223022536.000|TR0|
20101223022536.000|20101223022539.000|TR0|KING:  And we look forward to seeing you 
20101223022539.000|20101223022542.000|TR0|in March at the Coliseum in Las Vegas at

20101223022545.000|20101223022548.000|TR0|
20101223022548.000|20101223022551.000|TR0|DION:  Thank you, Larry.  Rene and I, we 
20101223022551.000|20101223022554.000|TR0|love you.  Thank you for everything you've 
20101223022554.000|20101223022557.000|TR0|done for us.  The best to you.  My best to 
20101223022557.000|20101223022600.000|TR0|Shawn and your whole family.  We love you 
20101223022600.000|20101223022603.000|TR0|dearly.  Happy holidays to all of you. 
20101223022603.000|20101223022606.000|TR0|Thank you.

20101223022609.000|20101223022612.000|TR0|KING:  Same to you, Celine.  Celine Dion, 
20101223022612.000|20101223022615.000|TR0|only the best.

20101223022618.000|20101223022621.000|TR0|Kathy Ireland is next.

20101223022624.000|20101223022627.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)     KING:  Kathy 
20101223022627.000|20101223022629.000|TR0|Ireland, an actress, a model, author and 
20101223022629.000|20101223022632.000|TR0|entrepreneur, and CEO of Kathy Ireland 
20101223022632.000|20101223022635.000|TR0|Worldwide.  We welcome her to LARRY KING 
20101223022635.000|20101223022638.000|TR0|LIVE worldwide.  Thanks for coming.
20101223022638.000|20101223022641.000|TR0|
20101223022641.000|20101223022644.000|TR0|"Forbes Magazine" once described you as 
20101223022644.000|20101223022647.000|TR0|the prototype for models who become 
20101223022647.000|20101223022650.000|TR0|business moguls.  Were you always 
20101223022650.000|20101223022653.000|TR0|entrepreneurial?
20101223022653.000|20101223022656.000|TR0|
20101223022656.000|20101223022659.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I always was, Larry.  My -- 
20101223022659.000|20101223022702.000|TR0|first of all, thank you for your kind 
20101223022702.000|20101223022705.000|TR0|introduction.  My goodness, actress.  I 
20101223022705.000|20101223022708.000|TR0|tell people I was never an actress.  I got 
20101223022708.000|20101223022711.000|TR0|the movies to prove it.  But thank you to 
20101223022711.000|20101223022714.000|TR0|spend this time with you.
20101223022714.000|20101223022717.000|TR0|
20101223022717.000|20101223022720.000|TR0|KING:  My pleasure.
20101223022720.000|20101223022723.000|TR0|
20101223022723.000|20101223022726.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Last time on this format, for 
20101223022726.000|20101223022729.000|TR0|bringing the great American dialogue for 
20101223022729.000|20101223022732.000|TR0|us.  Thank you so much.
20101223022732.000|20101223022735.000|TR0|
20101223022735.000|20101223022738.000|TR0|But in answer to your question, I've 
20101223022738.000|20101223022741.000|TR0|always been an entrepreneur. My first job, 
20101223022741.000|20101223022744.000|TR0|four years old, sold painted rocks from my 
20101223022744.000|20101223022747.000|TR0|wagon, combination of design and business. 
20101223022747.000|20101223022750.000|TR0| Paper route, always worked.  I enter the 
20101223022750.000|20101223022753.000|TR0|modeling industry as a business person 
20101223022753.000|20101223022756.000|TR0|already.
20101223022756.000|20101223022759.000|TR0|
20101223022759.000|20101223022802.000|TR0|KING:  So you don't know where that comes 
20101223022802.000|20101223022805.000|TR0|from?  It was inbred in a sense.  You had 
20101223022805.000|20101223022808.000|TR0|it?
20101223022808.000|20101223022810.000|TR0|
20101223022810.000|20101223022813.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I did, I did.  It was a passion.
20101223022813.000|20101223022816.000|TR0|
20101223022816.000|20101223022819.000|TR0|KING:  Jessica Simpson's made headline 
20101223022819.000|20101223022822.000|TR0|because her fashion empire nears the 
20101223022822.000|20101223022825.000|TR0|billion mark.  Your brand has already 
20101223022825.000|20101223022828.000|TR0|passe that.  What was the first product?  
20101223022828.000|20101223022831.000|TR0|What was the first Kathy Ireland brand?
20101223022831.000|20101223022834.000|TR0|
20101223022834.000|20101223022837.000|TR0|IRELAND:  The first product was a pair of 
20101223022837.000|20101223022840.000|TR0|socks.  People said, that's a stupid idea. 
20101223022840.000|20101223022843.000|TR0| You can't start a brand with a pair of 
20101223022843.000|20101223022846.000|TR0|socks. One of the greatest blessings from 
20101223022846.000|20101223022849.000|TR0|the long ago modeling career was all the 
20101223022849.000|20101223022852.000|TR0|rejection.  When people said, that's a 
20101223022852.000|20101223022855.000|TR0|dumb idea, not going to work, it didn't 
20101223022855.000|20101223022858.000|TR0|faze me.  I was used to that.  I had the 
20101223022858.000|20101223022901.000|TR0|perseverance.
20101223022901.000|20101223022904.000|TR0|
20101223022904.000|20101223022907.000|TR0|But I think it's really been a blessing.  
20101223022907.000|20101223022910.000|TR0|I did OK as a model. But no one was 
20101223022910.000|20101223022913.000|TR0|offering me endorsements.  I think some 
20101223022913.000|20101223022916.000|TR0|people opened doors out of curiosity.  But 
20101223022916.000|20101223022919.000|TR0|oftentimes I think my ideas -- I don't 
20101223022919.000|20101223022922.000|TR0|know, as a CEO and a chief designer, would 
20101223022922.000|20101223022925.000|TR0|have been taken more seriously if I just 
20101223022925.000|20101223022928.000|TR0|showed up with my sketch pad and my 
20101223022928.000|20101223022931.000|TR0|business plan. Might have moved forward a 
20101223022931.000|20101223022934.000|TR0|little faster.
20101223022934.000|20101223022937.000|TR0|
20101223022937.000|20101223022940.000|TR0|KING:  What was the fun of modeling?  Or 
20101223022940.000|20101223022943.000|TR0|was there fun in modeling?
20101223022943.000|20101223022946.000|TR0|
20101223022946.000|20101223022948.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I always knew I belonged on the 
20101223022948.000|20101223022951.000|TR0|other side of the camera.
20101223022951.000|20101223022954.000|TR0|
20101223022954.000|20101223022957.000|TR0|KING:  Really?  Despite the way you 
20101223022957.000|20101223023000.000|TR0|looked?  And you knew you looked good.
20101223023000.000|20101223023003.000|TR0|
20101223023003.000|20101223023006.000|TR0|IRELAND:  You're kind.  You know, I --
20101223023006.000|20101223023009.000|TR0|
20101223023009.000|20101223023012.000|TR0|KING:  You don't think you look good?      
20101223023012.000|20101223023015.000|TR0| IRELAND:  It wasn't -- that wasn't on my 
20101223023015.000|20101223023018.000|TR0|radar at all.  And it wasn't part of my 
20101223023018.000|20101223023021.000|TR0|plan.  I'm grateful.  What an 
20101223023021.000|20101223023024.000|TR0|extraordinary education it was, travel, 
20101223023024.000|20101223023027.000|TR0|being exposed to the best designers and 
20101223023027.000|20101223023030.000|TR0|different cultures.  But as a teenager, 
20101223023030.000|20101223023033.000|TR0|Larry, I would show up at my motel room in 
20101223023033.000|20101223023036.000|TR0|Europe to be meant by pimps waiting there, 
20101223023036.000|20101223023039.000|TR0|only to learn that the person representing 
20101223023039.000|20101223023042.000|TR0|me had sent that person there.
20101223023042.000|20101223023045.000|TR0|
20101223023045.000|20101223023048.000|TR0|And it's just -- you can see why young 
20101223023048.000|20101223023051.000|TR0|girls get caught up in these atrocities.  
20101223023051.000|20101223023054.000|TR0|The sexual --
20101223023054.000|20101223023057.000|TR0|
20101223023057.000|20101223023100.000|TR0|KING:  How long were you a model?
20101223023100.000|20101223023103.000|TR0|
20101223023103.000|20101223023106.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I was a model -- gosh, about 15 
20101223023106.000|20101223023109.000|TR0|years.
20101223023109.000|20101223023112.000|TR0|
20101223023112.000|20101223023115.000|TR0|KING:  How did you escape that?  How did 
20101223023115.000|20101223023118.000|TR0|you escape what they were trying to get 
20101223023118.000|20101223023121.000|TR0|you to do?
20101223023121.000|20101223023124.000|TR0|
20101223023124.000|20101223023126.000|TR0|IRELAND:  You know, something my mom told 
20101223023126.000|20101223023129.000|TR0|me when I first started modeling -- I 
20101223023129.000|20101223023132.000|TR0|thought it was odd advice at the time, but 
20101223023132.000|20101223023135.000|TR0|she said nothing is free.  And I am really 
20101223023135.000|20101223023138.000|TR0|blessed.  I had some great parents. And I 
20101223023138.000|20101223023141.000|TR0|had a best friend I got when I was 18 
20101223023141.000|20101223023144.000|TR0|years old that really helped me through 
20101223023144.000|20101223023147.000|TR0|everything.
20101223023147.000|20101223023150.000|TR0|
20101223023150.000|20101223023153.000|TR0|KING:  Girlfriend?
20101223023153.000|20101223023156.000|TR0|
20101223023156.000|20101223023159.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Jesus.
20101223023159.000|20101223023202.000|TR0|
20101223023202.000|20101223023205.000|TR0|KING:  Jesus is your best friend?
20101223023205.000|20101223023208.000|TR0|
20101223023208.000|20101223023211.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Became my best friend when I was 
20101223023211.000|20101223023214.000|TR0|18.  I got to say, I'm a slow learner.  
20101223023214.000|20101223023217.000|TR0|But that relationship helped me to walk 
20101223023217.000|20101223023220.000|TR0|away from so many situations that were 
20101223023220.000|20101223023223.000|TR0|compromising, dangerous.  It just gave me 
20101223023223.000|20101223023226.000|TR0|the -- I knew I could do anything else for 
20101223023226.000|20101223023229.000|TR0|a living, you know, cleaning toilets, 
20101223023229.000|20101223023232.000|TR0|anything, but that I didn't need to 
20101223023232.000|20101223023235.000|TR0|compromise.
20101223023235.000|20101223023238.000|TR0|
20101223023238.000|20101223023241.000|TR0|KING:  When you started in the business 
20101223023241.000|20101223023244.000|TR0|world, were your looks a hindrance?  Did 
20101223023244.000|20101223023247.000|TR0|people tend not to look past the way you 
20101223023247.000|20101223023250.000|TR0|looked?
20101223023250.000|20101223023253.000|TR0|
20101223023253.000|20101223023256.000|TR0|IRELAND:  You know what is interesting, 
20101223023256.000|20101223023259.000|TR0|Larry?  Several years ago, I had an 
20101223023259.000|20101223023302.000|TR0|accident.  I was wagon surfing, for lack 
20101223023302.000|20101223023305.000|TR0|of better words.  I jumped in our kids' 
20101223023305.000|20101223023307.000|TR0|wagon, standing on it.  We have a circular 
20101223023307.000|20101223023310.000|TR0|brick driveway.  I asked my husband to 
20101223023310.000|20101223023313.000|TR0|push me while I stood there and I steered. 
20101223023313.000|20101223023316.000|TR0| And it was really fun until I noticed my 
20101223023316.000|20101223023319.000|TR0|parked car.  I overcorrected the turn, 
20101223023319.000|20101223023322.000|TR0|face plant.  My face was smashed, busted 
20101223023322.000|20101223023325.000|TR0|nose, teeth.
20101223023325.000|20101223023328.000|TR0|
20101223023328.000|20101223023331.000|TR0|I was swollen.  Our daughter Lilly was 
20101223023331.000|20101223023334.000|TR0|just a baby at the time. She cried when 
20101223023334.000|20101223023337.000|TR0|she saw me, because I was so scary 
20101223023337.000|20101223023340.000|TR0|looking.  Our son thought it was great, 
20101223023340.000|20101223023343.000|TR0|because I could scare his friends.  But 
20101223023343.000|20101223023346.000|TR0|during that time, our business experienced 
20101223023346.000|20101223023349.000|TR0|the most growth that it's ever had.
20101223023349.000|20101223023352.000|TR0|
20101223023352.000|20101223023355.000|TR0|KING:  So is the lesson be ugly?
20101223023355.000|20101223023358.000|TR0|
20101223023358.000|20101223023401.000|TR0|IRELAND:  The lesson is that I was 
20101223023401.000|20101223023404.000|TR0|absolutely free from worry of appearance, 
20101223023404.000|20101223023407.000|TR0|that our brand was not dependent upon how 
20101223023407.000|20101223023410.000|TR0|I looked.  I never felt comfortable 
20101223023410.000|20101223023413.000|TR0|earning a paycheck off how someone else 
20101223023413.000|20101223023416.000|TR0|perceived that I looked.
20101223023416.000|20101223023419.000|TR0|
20101223023419.000|20101223023422.000|TR0|KING:  What has been the most successful 
20101223023422.000|20101223023425.000|TR0|aspect of the brand? What product?
20101223023425.000|20101223023428.000|TR0|
20101223023428.000|20101223023431.000|TR0|IRELAND:  It's difficult to say any one 
20101223023431.000|20101223023434.000|TR0|product.  Our mission is finding solutions 
20101223023434.000|20101223023437.000|TR0|for families, especially busy moms.  We 
20101223023437.000|20101223023440.000|TR0|design and market over 45,000 products.  
20101223023440.000|20101223023443.000|TR0|It's a lot of stuff.
20101223023443.000|20101223023445.000|TR0|
20101223023445.000|20101223023448.000|TR0|KING:  You mean like Amway?
20101223023448.000|20101223023451.000|TR0|
20101223023451.000|20101223023454.000|TR0|IRELAND:  No, it's -- Independent Retailer 
20101223023454.000|20101223023457.000|TR0|is our foundation. These earrings, Gary's 
20101223023457.000|20101223023500.000|TR0|Beverly Hills, 35,000 dollars.  The

20101223023503.000|20101223023506.000|TR0|Jewelers, 200 dollars.  So there's my 
20101223023506.000|20101223023509.000|TR0|shameless plug.  But it's a range.  
20101223023509.000|20101223023512.000|TR0|There's got to be a solution.
20101223023512.000|20101223023515.000|TR0|
20101223023515.000|20101223023518.000|TR0|We have four promises, it's fashion, 
20101223023518.000|20101223023521.000|TR0|quality, value and safety. We've expanded 
20101223023521.000|20101223023524.000|TR0|our mission to finding solutions for 
20101223023524.000|20101223023527.000|TR0|people in love, for weddings.  When I got 
20101223023527.000|20101223023530.000|TR0|married 22 years ago, greatest day, 1988. 
20101223023530.000|20101223023533.000|TR0|So I was inspired by Princess Diana.  My 
20101223023533.000|20101223023536.000|TR0|sleeves were so big.  As a bride, I 
20101223023536.000|20101223023539.000|TR0|couldn't use the restroom.  I had to bring 
20101223023539.000|20101223023542.000|TR0|in outhouses.  I could I barely squeeze in 
20101223023542.000|20101223023545.000|TR0|to outhouse with those big sleeves.
20101223023545.000|20101223023548.000|TR0|
20101223023548.000|20101223023551.000|TR0|KING:  You supervise all the things you do?
20101223023551.000|20101223023554.000|TR0|
20101223023554.000|20101223023557.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I do.  I don't put my name on 
20101223023557.000|20101223023600.000|TR0|anything.  I give my heart to everything.  
20101223023600.000|20101223023603.000|TR0|My life is crazy.  And I get approached by 
20101223023603.000|20101223023606.000|TR0|people far more famous than I will ever 
20101223023606.000|20101223023609.000|TR0|be.  And they tell me how hard it is.  And 
20101223023609.000|20101223023612.000|TR0|my answer is just kind of, well, duh; it's 
20101223023612.000|20101223023615.000|TR0|really hard. I'm involved in everything 
20101223023615.000|20101223023618.000|TR0|from sketching, photography, 2C issues, HR 
20101223023618.000|20101223023621.000|TR0|issues, shipping, distribution.
20101223023621.000|20101223023623.000|TR0|
20101223023623.000|20101223023626.000|TR0|I'm stocking shelves.  I don't get a whole 
20101223023626.000|20101223023629.000|TR0|heck of a lot of sleep.  But I love what I 
20101223023629.000|20101223023632.000|TR0|do.  I've got a passion for it.  And I 
20101223023632.000|20101223023635.000|TR0|love serving women out there.
20101223023635.000|20101223023638.000|TR0|
20101223023638.000|20101223023641.000|TR0|KING:  How has the recession hit you?
20101223023641.000|20101223023644.000|TR0|
20101223023644.000|20101223023647.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I don't know anybody who has not 
20101223023647.000|20101223023650.000|TR0|been impacted by this economy.  And so 
20101223023650.000|20101223023653.000|TR0|many of our products are in the home 
20101223023653.000|20101223023656.000|TR0|industry. People are foreclosing on their 
20101223023656.000|20101223023659.000|TR0|homes.  So it's something that we saw even 
20101223023659.000|20101223023702.000|TR0|before it happened.
20101223023702.000|20101223023705.000|TR0|

20101223023708.000|20101223023711.000|TR0|Moms, Your Guide to Success and Sanity."  
20101223023711.000|20101223023714.000|TR0|First chapter was on economic crisis.  
20101223023714.000|20101223023717.000|TR0|That was before our country's economic 
20101223023717.000|20101223023720.000|TR0|catastrophe hit.  I got criticism; why are 
20101223023720.000|20101223023723.000|TR0|you saying we're living in the great 
20101223023723.000|20101223023726.000|TR0|depression?  Why are you making this the 
20101223023726.000|20101223023729.000|TR0|first chapter?
20101223023729.000|20101223023732.000|TR0|
20101223023732.000|20101223023735.000|TR0|But it's impacting everyone.  And today's 
20101223023735.000|20101223023738.000|TR0|luxury is a job.
20101223023738.000|20101223023741.000|TR0|
20101223023741.000|20101223023744.000|TR0|KING:  All right.  When you balance it 
20101223023744.000|20101223023747.000|TR0|all, career, mom, is mom the most 
20101223023747.000|20101223023750.000|TR0|important?
20101223023750.000|20101223023753.000|TR0|
20101223023753.000|20101223023756.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Absolutely, hands down.  When I 
20101223023756.000|20101223023759.000|TR0|was a kid, I changed my mind so often what 
20101223023759.000|20101223023802.000|TR0|I wanted to be when I grew up, but I 
20101223023802.000|20101223023804.000|TR0|always knew I wanted to be a mom.  And 
20101223023804.000|20101223023807.000|TR0|something that I love about you is that 
20101223023807.000|20101223023810.000|TR0|every day you pick your kids up from 
20101223023810.000|20101223023813.000|TR0|school.  That is so awesome for them to 
20101223023813.000|20101223023816.000|TR0|know that -- you talk to the most famous 
20101223023816.000|20101223023819.000|TR0|people on Earth.  But for them to know how 
20101223023819.000|20101223023822.000|TR0|important they are, that you would do 
20101223023822.000|20101223023825.000|TR0|that.  I just -- I love that.

20101223023828.000|20101223023831.000|TR0|KING:  Back with more of the fabulous

20101223023849.000|20101223023852.000|TR0|KING:  We're back with Kathy Ireland.  Has 
20101223023852.000|20101223023855.000|TR0|it been hard to balance marriage through 
20101223023855.000|20101223023858.000|TR0|all of this?  Your husband's a doctor and 
20101223023858.000|20101223023901.000|TR0|a fishermen.
20101223023901.000|20101223023904.000|TR0|
20101223023904.000|20101223023907.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Yes, my husband Greg is an E.R. 
20101223023907.000|20101223023910.000|TR0|doctor, commercial fishermen, fishes for 
20101223023910.000|20101223023913.000|TR0|lobster.  It's tough.  Balance, I can't 
20101223023913.000|20101223023916.000|TR0|say that I always have it.  But for me 
20101223023916.000|20101223023919.000|TR0|I've really found it's a matter of 
20101223023919.000|20101223023922.000|TR0|honoring the priorities.  It's my faith.  
20101223023922.000|20101223023925.000|TR0|It's my family.  And then it's being of 
20101223023925.000|20101223023928.000|TR0|service through our work.
20101223023928.000|20101223023931.000|TR0|
20101223023931.000|20101223023934.000|TR0|And when those priorities are not in 
20101223023934.000|20101223023937.000|TR0|order, I'm a disaster.  I'm just crawling 
20101223023937.000|20101223023940.000|TR0|around, trying to get from point A to 
20101223023940.000|20101223023942.000|TR0|point B.  I'm not effective at anything.
20101223023942.000|20101223023945.000|TR0|
20101223023945.000|20101223023948.000|TR0|KING:  You're into brides now, huh?  Doing 
20101223023948.000|20101223023951.000|TR0|work for brides?
20101223023951.000|20101223023954.000|TR0|
20101223023954.000|20101223023957.000|TR0|IRELAND:  We are.  We're serving brides 
20101223023957.000|20101223024000.000|TR0|from estates to bridal gowns.  Just 
20101223024000.000|20101223024003.000|TR0|launched 30,000 designs of bridal gowns 
20101223024003.000|20101223024006.000|TR0|and special occasion dressings with Kathy 
20101223024006.000|20101223024009.000|TR0|Ireland --
20101223024009.000|20101223024012.000|TR0|
20101223024012.000|20101223024015.000|TR0|KING:  You going to make a pitch to Kate 
20101223024015.000|20101223024018.000|TR0|Middleton?
20101223024018.000|20101223024021.000|TR0|
20101223024021.000|20101223024024.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Oh, gosh, she certainly doesn't 
20101223024024.000|20101223024027.000|TR0|need my help.  But what an extraordinary 
20101223024027.000|20101223024030.000|TR0|young woman.  And that's going to be a 
20101223024030.000|20101223024033.000|TR0|spectacular wedding.
20101223024033.000|20101223024036.000|TR0|
20101223024036.000|20101223024039.000|TR0|KING:  All right.  A recent Pew Research 
20101223024039.000|20101223024042.000|TR0|Center study showed nearly four in 10 
20101223024042.000|20101223024045.000|TR0|Americans think marriage is becoming 
20101223024045.000|20101223024048.000|TR0|obsolete. What's your reaction to that?  
20101223024048.000|20101223024051.000|TR0|And it's growing.
20101223024051.000|20101223024054.000|TR0|
20101223024054.000|20101223024057.000|TR0|IRELAND:  It's sad.  It's sad.  I think it 
20101223024057.000|20101223024100.000|TR0|is -- it is such a special, special thing, 
20101223024100.000|20101223024103.000|TR0|a commitment.  I think in life we just 
20101223024103.000|20101223024106.000|TR0|don't have enough commitment.  We want to 
20101223024106.000|20101223024109.000|TR0|bail when things get tough.  And life is 
20101223024109.000|20101223024112.000|TR0|tough.  But to work through those things, 
20101223024112.000|20101223024115.000|TR0|it makes you so much stronger.  It's not 
20101223024115.000|20101223024118.000|TR0|easy.  But it's so worth it.
20101223024118.000|20101223024120.000|TR0|
20101223024120.000|20101223024123.000|TR0|KING:  You can have a commitment without a 
20101223024123.000|20101223024126.000|TR0|marriage, can't you? Or you can have a 
20101223024126.000|20101223024129.000|TR0|marriage that's not committed.
20101223024129.000|20101223024132.000|TR0|
20101223024132.000|20101223024135.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Absolutely, you can, but it's 
20101223024135.000|20101223024138.000|TR0|really -- it's -- it's where your heart 
20101223024138.000|20101223024141.000|TR0|is.  And people get married for all 
20101223024141.000|20101223024144.000|TR0|different sorts of reasons.  But I think 
20101223024144.000|20101223024147.000|TR0|it's -- it's having that commitment, that 
20101223024147.000|20101223024150.000|TR0|you're going to be with that one person 
20101223024150.000|20101223024153.000|TR0|for the rest of your life.
20101223024153.000|20101223024156.000|TR0|
20101223024156.000|20101223024159.000|TR0|KING:  How do you balance faith in all of 
20101223024159.000|20101223024202.000|TR0|this?       IRELAND:  You know, Larry, 
20101223024202.000|20101223024205.000|TR0|it's tricky for me, because I do sell a 
20101223024205.000|20101223024208.000|TR0|lot of stuff, and I never want to exploit 
20101223024208.000|20101223024211.000|TR0|my faith.  Yet it's something I'm not 
20101223024211.000|20101223024214.000|TR0|ashamed of it.  And it's the most 
20101223024214.000|20101223024217.000|TR0|important part of my life.  So I can't 
20101223024217.000|20101223024220.000|TR0|separate it.  It's just -- it's just 
20101223024220.000|20101223024223.000|TR0|intertwined and it certainly impacts 
20101223024223.000|20101223024226.000|TR0|decisions, how we work.
20101223024226.000|20101223024229.000|TR0|
20101223024229.000|20101223024232.000|TR0|KING:  Do you require your children to 
20101223024232.000|20101223024235.000|TR0|have it?
20101223024235.000|20101223024238.000|TR0|
20101223024238.000|20101223024241.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I can't.  It's got to be their 
20101223024241.000|20101223024244.000|TR0|own choice.  I share with them my faith.  
20101223024244.000|20101223024247.000|TR0|But I also share with them God doesn't 
20101223024247.000|20101223024250.000|TR0|have grandchildren.  You got to have your 
20101223024250.000|20101223024253.000|TR0|own.  And you've also -- not only need to 
20101223024253.000|20101223024256.000|TR0|figure out for yourself what do you 
20101223024256.000|20101223024258.000|TR0|believe in, but why.  Why do you have the 
20101223024258.000|20101223024301.000|TR0|values you have and have conviction for 
20101223024301.000|20101223024304.000|TR0|it.  Because those values will be 
20101223024304.000|20101223024307.000|TR0|challenged.  And if you can't articulate 
20101223024307.000|20101223024310.000|TR0|-- if you can't think of why you stand for 
20101223024310.000|20101223024313.000|TR0|what you do, you're going to fall.
20101223024313.000|20101223024316.000|TR0|
20101223024316.000|20101223024319.000|TR0|KING:  In the world you live in and the 
20101223024319.000|20101223024322.000|TR0|world you came from, you must know many 
20101223024322.000|20101223024325.000|TR0|gays.
20101223024325.000|20101223024328.000|TR0|
20101223024328.000|20101223024331.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Yes.

20101223024334.000|20101223024337.000|TR0|KING:  Do you have trouble -- any problem 
20101223024337.000|20101223024340.000|TR0|balancing that with what your religion may 
20101223024340.000|20101223024343.000|TR0|teach you about it?
20101223024343.000|20101223024346.000|TR0|
20101223024346.000|20101223024349.000|TR0|IRELAND:  You know what's been an 
20101223024349.000|20101223024352.000|TR0|atrocity, Larry, is people who claim 
20101223024352.000|20101223024355.000|TR0|Christianity throughout the years, and 
20101223024355.000|20101223024358.000|TR0|have hurt people so badly, from the 
20101223024358.000|20101223024401.000|TR0|Crusades, where thousands of Jews and 
20101223024401.000|20101223024404.000|TR0|Muslims were slaughtered, to the 
20101223024404.000|20101223024407.000|TR0|Holocaust, where 90 percent of Germany 
20101223024407.000|20101223024410.000|TR0|citizens claim to be church going 
20101223024410.000|20101223024413.000|TR0|Christians.  While, yes, there were 
20101223024413.000|20101223024416.000|TR0|individuals who came to the aid of the 
20101223024416.000|20101223024419.000|TR0|Jews, not one Christian organization made 
20101223024419.000|20101223024422.000|TR0|an attempt to stop the Holocaust.
20101223024422.000|20101223024425.000|TR0|
20101223024425.000|20101223024428.000|TR0|It's an atrocity.  And sadly Christians 
20101223024428.000|20101223024431.000|TR0|have earned this reputation with 
20101223024431.000|20101223024434.000|TR0|hypocrisy, with hate --
20101223024434.000|20101223024437.000|TR0|
20101223024437.000|20101223024439.000|TR0|KING:  About gays, like bullying of gays?
20101223024439.000|20101223024442.000|TR0|
20101223024442.000|20101223024445.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Bullying is horrible.  And we 
20101223024445.000|20101223024448.000|TR0|have to fight against it.
20101223024448.000|20101223024451.000|TR0|
20101223024451.000|20101223024454.000|TR0|KING:  Isn't it hard though when much of 
20101223024454.000|20101223024457.000|TR0|your faith teaches it is a sin?
20101223024457.000|20101223024500.000|TR0|
20101223024500.000|20101223024503.000|TR0|IRELAND:  It teach us not to judge.  I 
20101223024503.000|20101223024506.000|TR0|just did a project for the Trevor Project 
20101223024506.000|20101223024509.000|TR0|recently.  Bullying is not OK in any way, 
20101223024509.000|20101223024512.000|TR0|shape or form.  And it breaks my heart 
20101223024512.000|20101223024515.000|TR0|when I see adults doing it.  And what does 
20101223024515.000|20101223024518.000|TR0|that say to kids?
20101223024518.000|20101223024521.000|TR0|
20101223024521.000|20101223024524.000|TR0|I've been bullied.  And it's a cyber 
20101223024524.000|20101223024527.000|TR0|bullying.  And it's -- people dehumanize 
20101223024527.000|20101223024530.000|TR0|one another.  I work with a very diverse 
20101223024530.000|20101223024533.000|TR0|team.  And we get it from every angle.  I 
20101223024533.000|20101223024536.000|TR0|get attacked for my faith.  We have 
20101223024536.000|20101223024539.000|TR0|attacks from people who hate gays.  It is 
20101223024539.000|20101223024542.000|TR0|an atrocity, bigotry.
20101223024542.000|20101223024545.000|TR0|
20101223024545.000|20101223024548.000|TR0|I mean, we're just a mix.  We're a melting 
20101223024548.000|20101223024551.000|TR0|pot of people.  And I love being with 
20101223024551.000|20101223024554.000|TR0|people who are different from me.  You get 
20101223024554.000|20101223024557.000|TR0|great dialogue, great debate, great -- 
20101223024557.000|20101223024600.000|TR0|people who don't share my faith.  I love 
20101223024600.000|20101223024603.000|TR0|to hear what their thoughts are and their 
20101223024603.000|20101223024606.000|TR0|beliefs.  And it's -- I think it makes for 
20101223024606.000|20101223024609.000|TR0|really healthy debate and conversation.
20101223024609.000|20101223024612.000|TR0|
20101223024612.000|20101223024615.000|TR0|KING:  Well said.  Earlier this year, 
20101223024615.000|20101223024617.000|TR0|there were some nasty Internet and media 
20101223024617.000|20101223024620.000|TR0|comments about your behavior while 
20101223024620.000|20101223024623.000|TR0|interviewing stars on the red carpet at 
20101223024623.000|20101223024626.000|TR0|the Oscars.  Some suggested you weren't 
20101223024626.000|20101223024629.000|TR0|sober.  Some said you looked pregnant.  
20101223024629.000|20101223024632.000|TR0|There seemed to be a wave of attacks on 
20101223024632.000|20101223024635.000|TR0|you.
20101223024635.000|20101223024638.000|TR0|
20101223024638.000|20101223024641.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Right.
20101223024641.000|20101223024644.000|TR0|
20101223024644.000|20101223024647.000|TR0|KING:  Want to respond?
20101223024647.000|20101223024650.000|TR0|
20101223024650.000|20101223024653.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Well, sure.  The sober thing, 
20101223024653.000|20101223024656.000|TR0|that made me mad, because I'm a mom, and 
20101223024656.000|20101223024659.000|TR0|we have kids.  And that couldn't have been 
20101223024659.000|20101223024702.000|TR0|further from the truth.  The pregnancy 
20101223024702.000|20101223024705.000|TR0|thing, hey, I'll take that.  I probably 
20101223024705.000|20101223024708.000|TR0|had a few too many snacks that day.  You 
20101223024708.000|20101223024711.000|TR0|know, it's --
20101223024711.000|20101223024714.000|TR0|
20101223024714.000|20101223024717.000|TR0|KING:  Do you regret -- I didn't see it.  
20101223024717.000|20101223024720.000|TR0|Did you do something that you were sorry 
20101223024720.000|20101223024723.000|TR0|about?
20101223024723.000|20101223024726.000|TR0|
20101223024726.000|20101223024729.000|TR0|IRELAND:  No.  No.  I actually responded 
20101223024729.000|20101223024732.000|TR0|to -- there were so -- the thing that made 
20101223024732.000|20101223024735.000|TR0|me really angry was somebody was promoting 
20101223024735.000|20101223024738.000|TR0|violence.  They sent a Tweet saying that 
20101223024738.000|20101223024741.000|TR0|the person who hired me should be shot.  
20101223024741.000|20101223024744.000|TR0|And I responded back that that is just not 
20101223024744.000|20101223024747.000|TR0|OK.  And some people said, why don't you 
20101223024747.000|20101223024750.000|TR0|just leave it alone.  I said no, when 
20101223024750.000|20101223024753.000|TR0|someone crosses the line, if they're doing 
20101223024753.000|20101223024755.000|TR0|this to me as an adult -- look, I'm a big 
20101223024755.000|20101223024758.000|TR0|girl, I can take it.  But what's happening 
20101223024758.000|20101223024801.000|TR0|to kids out there?  What kind of attacks 
20101223024801.000|20101223024804.000|TR0|are going on --
20101223024804.000|20101223024807.000|TR0|
20101223024807.000|20101223024810.000|TR0|KING:  Criticizing the way you handled the 
20101223024810.000|20101223024813.000|TR0|interviews?  What were they criticizing?
20101223024813.000|20101223024816.000|TR0|
20101223024816.000|20101223024819.000|TR0|IRELAND:  You know what?  I honestly don't 
20101223024819.000|20101223024822.000|TR0|know.  I mean, I'm -- they can take shots 
20101223024822.000|20101223024825.000|TR0|at me.  But if they promote violence, if 
20101223024825.000|20101223024828.000|TR0|they're promoting things that's are not 
20101223024828.000|20101223024831.000|TR0|good, the bullying, that's not OK. But as 
20101223024831.000|20101223024834.000|TR0|far as what their actual -- I mean, 
20101223024834.000|20101223024837.000|TR0|everybody's entitled to their opinion and 
20101223024837.000|20101223024840.000|TR0|I'm good with that.  That's OK.
20101223024840.000|20101223024843.000|TR0|
20101223024843.000|20101223024846.000|TR0|KING:  More with Kathy Ireland.  We'll 
20101223024846.000|20101223024849.000|TR0|talk about her relationship with our 
20101223024849.000|20101223024852.000|TR0|friend, Dame Elizabeth Taylor, when we 
20101223024852.000|20101223024855.000|TR0|come back.
20101223024855.000|20101223024858.000|TR0|
20101223024858.000|20101223024901.000|TR0|(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
20101223024901.000|20101223024904.000|TR0|
20101223024904.000|20101223024907.000|TR0|KING:  We're back with the wonderful Kathy 
20101223024907.000|20101223024910.000|TR0|Ireland.  What a super lady.  Dame 
20101223024910.000|20101223024913.000|TR0|Elizabeth Taylor, with whom you've had a 
20101223024913.000|20101223024916.000|TR0|jewelry line, came to your defense through 
20101223024916.000|20101223024919.000|TR0|all of that.  She called you the epitome 
20101223024919.000|20101223024922.000|TR0|of grace and glamour.  How did you get to 
20101223024922.000|20101223024925.000|TR0|be friends with her?
20101223024925.000|20101223024928.000|TR0|
20101223024928.000|20101223024931.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I met Dame Elizabeth through 
20101223024931.000|20101223024934.000|TR0|mutual friends.  And she's become part of 
20101223024934.000|20101223024936.000|TR0|our extended family.  I've got so much 
20101223024936.000|20101223024939.000|TR0|respect for her. That woman, talk about 
20101223024939.000|20101223024942.000|TR0|fighting battles.  I mean, what an 
20101223024942.000|20101223024945.000|TR0|inspiration she is.
20101223024945.000|20101223024948.000|TR0|
20101223024948.000|20101223024951.000|TR0|Back in the '80s, when HIV/AIDS was just 
20101223024951.000|20101223024954.000|TR0|coming on to the scene, people didn't 
20101223024954.000|20101223024957.000|TR0|understand it, she begged her friends to 
20101223024957.000|20101223025000.000|TR0|help her out. She got death threats.  
20101223025000.000|20101223025003.000|TR0|Friends hung up on her.  But she didn't 
20101223025003.000|20101223025006.000|TR0|let any of that stop her.
20101223025006.000|20101223025009.000|TR0|
20101223025009.000|20101223025012.000|TR0|She's battled on and become the Joan of 
20101223025012.000|20101223025015.000|TR0|Arc of AIDS.
20101223025015.000|20101223025018.000|TR0|
20101223025018.000|20101223025021.000|TR0|KING:  How's she doing?
20101223025021.000|20101223025024.000|TR0|
20101223025024.000|20101223025027.000|TR0|IRELAND:  She's doing great.
20101223025027.000|20101223025030.000|TR0|
20101223025030.000|20101223025033.000|TR0|KING:  Her health good?
20101223025033.000|20101223025036.000|TR0|
20101223025036.000|20101223025039.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Her health is good.  She's 
20101223025039.000|20101223025042.000|TR0|strong.  She's spunky. She's feisty and 
20101223025042.000|20101223025045.000|TR0|full of life and hard at work.
20101223025045.000|20101223025048.000|TR0|
20101223025048.000|20101223025051.000|TR0|KING:  You competed in the ninth season of 
20101223025051.000|20101223025054.000|TR0|"Dancing With the Stars."  What did you 
20101223025054.000|20101223025057.000|TR0|make about the Bristol Palin fuss?
20101223025057.000|20101223025100.000|TR0|
20101223025100.000|20101223025103.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, first of 
20101223025103.000|20101223025106.000|TR0|all, with my "Dancing With the Stars," 
20101223025106.000|20101223025109.000|TR0|I've got to say, I had the best teacher in 
20101223025109.000|20101223025112.000|TR0|the world, Tony Dolvalani (ph), man of 
20101223025112.000|20101223025114.000|TR0|patience.  I'm not a star.  And for 
20101223025114.000|20101223025117.000|TR0|anybody who saw, I'm not a dancer.  But it 
20101223025117.000|20101223025120.000|TR0|was an opportunity to raise money for a 
20101223025120.000|20101223025123.000|TR0|nonprofit.
20101223025123.000|20101223025126.000|TR0|
20101223025126.000|20101223025129.000|TR0|KING:  How long did you last?
20101223025129.000|20101223025132.000|TR0|
20101223025132.000|20101223025135.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I lasted -- I was the third 
20101223025135.000|20101223025138.000|TR0|couple voted off.  And so I did a lot 
20101223025138.000|20101223025141.000|TR0|better than a lot of people thought.
20101223025141.000|20101223025144.000|TR0|
20101223025144.000|20101223025147.000|TR0|KING:  Was it fun?
20101223025147.000|20101223025150.000|TR0|
20101223025150.000|20101223025153.000|TR0|IRELAND:  It was so much fun.  It was so 
20101223025153.000|20101223025156.000|TR0|much fun.  And I think Bristol did a 
20101223025156.000|20101223025159.000|TR0|fantastic job.  Like me, she didn't have 
20101223025159.000|20101223025202.000|TR0|experience. And it is so hard.  I 
20101223025202.000|20101223025205.000|TR0|discovered muscles I never knew I had.
20101223025205.000|20101223025208.000|TR0|
20101223025208.000|20101223025211.000|TR0|KING:  Last time you were on this show, 
20101223025211.000|20101223025214.000|TR0|Spring of 2009, you spoke about having 
20101223025214.000|20101223025217.000|TR0|gained weight over the years and getting 
20101223025217.000|20101223025220.000|TR0|back in shape. Do you still have a weight 
20101223025220.000|20101223025223.000|TR0|issue?  Because if you do, I don't se it.
20101223025223.000|20101223025226.000|TR0|
20101223025226.000|20101223025229.000|TR0|IRELAND:  You're very kind, Larry.
20101223025229.000|20101223025232.000|TR0|
20101223025232.000|20101223025235.000|TR0|KING:  Where?  Where?
20101223025235.000|20101223025238.000|TR0|
20101223025238.000|20101223025241.000|TR0|IRELAND:  It's an easy thing to have 
20101223025241.000|20101223025244.000|TR0|happen.  I think there's no shame in a 
20101223025244.000|20101223025247.000|TR0|weight gain.  I think our society is too 
20101223025247.000|20101223025250.000|TR0|obsessed with it. And I'm so rebellious.  
20101223025250.000|20101223025252.000|TR0|I think that was one of my issues with 
20101223025252.000|20101223025255.000|TR0|modeling.  So much of it, it's an 
20101223025255.000|20101223025258.000|TR0|unattainable look, unattainable prices.  
20101223025258.000|20101223025301.000|TR0|And I just want my life to be real.
20101223025301.000|20101223025304.000|TR0|
20101223025304.000|20101223025307.000|TR0|And my goal is health.  It's not to fit in 
20101223025307.000|20101223025310.000|TR0|a certain size or look a certain way.  But 
20101223025310.000|20101223025313.000|TR0|I do want to be healthy and that's my 
20101223025313.000|20101223025316.000|TR0|goal.  You know, I get --
20101223025316.000|20101223025319.000|TR0|
20101223025319.000|20101223025322.000|TR0|KING:  What about the ultra-thin models, 
20101223025322.000|20101223025325.000|TR0|the "Vogue" look?  You never were that, 
20101223025325.000|20101223025328.000|TR0|right?
20101223025328.000|20101223025331.000|TR0|
20101223025331.000|20101223025334.000|TR0|IRELAND:  No.  I was never that.  And 
20101223025334.000|20101223025337.000|TR0|again, because it really wasn't part of my 
20101223025337.000|20101223025340.000|TR0|plan.  I just felt, look, if they don't 
20101223025340.000|20101223025343.000|TR0|like me for how I am, fine, I'll do 
20101223025343.000|20101223025346.000|TR0|something else for a living.  If this 
20101223025346.000|20101223025349.000|TR0|works out, great, I can save money for 
20101223025349.000|20101223025352.000|TR0|college or to start a business.  But it 
20101223025352.000|20101223025355.000|TR0|just -- because I had so many failed 
20101223025355.000|20101223025358.000|TR0|businesses, it took me a long time to 
20101223025358.000|20101223025401.000|TR0|finally start our own brand.
20101223025401.000|20101223025404.000|TR0|
20101223025404.000|20101223025407.000|TR0|KING:  You had a lot of failed businesses?
20101223025407.000|20101223025410.000|TR0|
20101223025410.000|20101223025413.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Oh, gosh.  I had so many failed 
20101223025413.000|20101223025416.000|TR0|businesses.  And I really learned you have 
20101223025416.000|20101223025419.000|TR0|to have a passion for what you're doing.  
20101223025419.000|20101223025422.000|TR0|And it's all about people.  It's -- like I 
20101223025422.000|20101223025425.000|TR0|said, I love diversity.  I love working 
20101223025425.000|20101223025428.000|TR0|with people who are different.  But when 
20101223025428.000|20101223025431.000|TR0|it comes to core values, it's so important 
20101223025431.000|20101223025433.000|TR0|to be on the same page, so that you're in 
20101223025433.000|20101223025436.000|TR0|sync.
20101223025436.000|20101223025439.000|TR0|
20101223025439.000|20101223025442.000|TR0|Something that our company does surprise 
20101223025442.000|20101223025445.000|TR0|factory inspections, how people are 
20101223025445.000|20101223025448.000|TR0|treated, that's critical.  We adhere to 
20101223025448.000|20101223025451.000|TR0|the highest standards of protection for 
20101223025451.000|20101223025454.000|TR0|human rights.
20101223025454.000|20101223025457.000|TR0|
20101223025457.000|20101223025500.000|TR0|KING:  Couple other things, your husband 
20101223025500.000|20101223025503.000|TR0|is an E.R. physician. That's probably the 
20101223025503.000|20101223025506.000|TR0|toughest job in medicine.
20101223025506.000|20101223025509.000|TR0|
20101223025509.000|20101223025512.000|TR0|IRELAND:  I can't imagine.  I couldn't do 
20101223025512.000|20101223025515.000|TR0|it.
20101223025515.000|20101223025518.000|TR0|
20101223025518.000|20101223025521.000|TR0|KING:  Has to know a lot about everything.
20101223025521.000|20101223025524.000|TR0|
20101223025524.000|20101223025527.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Yep.
20101223025527.000|20101223025530.000|TR0|
20101223025530.000|20101223025533.000|TR0|KING:  And you never know what your day is 
20101223025533.000|20101223025536.000|TR0|going to be like.
20101223025536.000|20101223025539.000|TR0|
20101223025539.000|20101223025542.000|TR0|IRELAND:  You never know what you're going 
20101223025542.000|20101223025545.000|TR0|to walk into.  You deal with people's 
20101223025545.000|20101223025548.000|TR0|suffering, so it's hard.  But I've got so 
20101223025548.000|20101223025551.000|TR0|much respect for Greg.  He does an amazing 
20101223025551.000|20101223025554.000|TR0|job.  And I think being a commercial 
20101223025554.000|20101223025557.000|TR0|fisherman really helps him.  He just -- he 
20101223025557.000|20101223025600.000|TR0|fishes for lobster and when he's not 
20101223025600.000|20101223025603.000|TR0|saving --
20101223025603.000|20101223025606.000|TR0|
20101223025606.000|20101223025609.000|TR0|KING:  -- more fishing than E.R.
20101223025609.000|20101223025611.000|TR0|
20101223025611.000|20101223025614.000|TR0|IRELAND:  He does.  When he's not killing 
20101223025614.000|20101223025617.000|TR0|lobster, he's saving lives.  So he gets 
20101223025617.000|20101223025620.000|TR0|that mix.
20101223025620.000|20101223025623.000|TR0|
20101223025623.000|20101223025626.000|TR0|KING:  Did he watch "E.R."?
20101223025626.000|20101223025629.000|TR0|
20101223025629.000|20101223025632.000|TR0|IRELAND:  He watched it a little bit, but 
20101223025632.000|20101223025635.000|TR0|working in the E.R., he didn't want to see 
20101223025635.000|20101223025638.000|TR0|it.  He's like, I was just there.  I don't 
20101223025638.000|20101223025641.000|TR0|want to relive it.  I loved it.  I loved 
20101223025641.000|20101223025644.000|TR0|watching it.  But he wanted to escape.
20101223025644.000|20101223025647.000|TR0|
20101223025647.000|20101223025650.000|TR0|KING:  Any goal on --
20101223025650.000|20101223025653.000|TR0|
20101223025653.000|20101223025656.000|TR0|IRELAND:  So many things, Larry.  So many 
20101223025656.000|20101223025659.000|TR0|things.
20101223025659.000|20101223025702.000|TR0|
20101223025702.000|20101223025705.000|TR0|KING:  Any new business you want to try?
20101223025705.000|20101223025708.000|TR0|
20101223025708.000|20101223025711.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Yes.  I mean, I want to continue 
20101223025711.000|20101223025714.000|TR0|to grow and learn in so many ways.  Our 
20101223025714.000|20101223025717.000|TR0|business is a baby business.  But I love 
20101223025717.000|20101223025720.000|TR0|what I do. I tell people, I have the 
20101223025720.000|20101223025723.000|TR0|toughest boss in the world, the moms out 
20101223025723.000|20101223025726.000|TR0|there.  And if you could see my Tweets, my 
20101223025726.000|20101223025729.000|TR0|e-mails, she doesn't care what I look 
20101223025729.000|20101223025732.000|TR0|like.  She doesn't care about any of that 
20101223025732.000|20101223025735.000|TR0|stuff.  She wants her solutions.  And 
20101223025735.000|20101223025738.000|TR0|she's really tough with me.
20101223025738.000|20101223025741.000|TR0|
20101223025741.000|20101223025744.000|TR0|And I love that.  It's wonderful.  So 
20101223025744.000|20101223025747.000|TR0|following what she tells me, being able to 
20101223025747.000|20101223025749.000|TR0|implement that, and I could -- I don't 
20101223025749.000|20101223025752.000|TR0|know where the future will take me.  
20101223025752.000|20101223025755.000|TR0|There's places I love.  I love visiting 
20101223025755.000|20101223025758.000|TR0|Israel and Haiti and different parts of 
20101223025758.000|20101223025801.000|TR0|the world that I feel really drawn to.
20101223025801.000|20101223025804.000|TR0|
20101223025804.000|20101223025807.000|TR0|KING:  Do you sell all over the world?  Do 
20101223025807.000|20101223025810.000|TR0|you sell products everywhere?
20101223025810.000|20101223025813.000|TR0|
20101223025813.000|20101223025816.000|TR0|IRELAND:  We do.  We have team members in 
20101223025816.000|20101223025819.000|TR0|Israel and we sell products in 50 
20101223025819.000|20101223025822.000|TR0|countries.  And I work with -- the brand 
20101223025822.000|20101223025825.000|TR0|bears my name, but I work with so many 
20101223025825.000|20101223025828.000|TR0|incredible people.  It is a team effort 
20101223025828.000|20101223025831.000|TR0|and a great team.
20101223025831.000|20101223025834.000|TR0|
20101223025834.000|20101223025837.000|TR0|KING:  Always great seeing you.  Thanks so 
20101223025837.000|20101223025840.000|TR0|much.

20101223025843.000|20101223025846.000|TR0|IRELAND:  Larry, I just have to say, I am 
20101223025846.000|20101223025849.000|TR0|going to steal from George and Ira 
20101223025849.000|20101223025852.000|TR0|Gershwin, it makes me think of you that 
20101223025852.000|20101223025855.000|TR0|the world -- pardon my mush -- but, Larry, 
20101223025855.000|20101223025858.000|TR0|we've all got a crush on you.  Thank you 
20101223025858.000|20101223025901.000|TR0|for everything you give us.
20101223025901.000|20101223025904.000|TR0|
20101223025904.000|20101223025907.000|TR0|KING:  You have a crush on me?
