20101223020903.000|20101223020906.000|CC1|>> I CANNOT IMAGINE THIS        
20101223020906.000|20101223020907.000|CC1|PRESIDENT TAKING IT TO THE LIMIT
20101223020907.000|20101223020909.000|CC1|WITH THE RUSSIANS.              
20101223020909.000|20101223020911.000|CC1|NOTHING HE HAS DONE HAS         
20101223020911.000|20101223020913.000|CC1|CONVINCED ME THAT HE IS         
20101223020913.000|20101223020914.000|CC1|COMMITTED TO DEFENSE.           
20101223020914.000|20101223020916.000|CC1|>> Ifill: BUT IN THE END, 13    
20101223020916.000|20101223020917.000|CC1|REPUBLICANS JOINED THE VOTE FOR 
20101223020917.000|20101223020919.000|CC1|RATIFICATION.

20101223020920.000|20101223020922.000|CC1|CRITICIZED FROM BOTH SIDES MAY  
20101223020922.000|20101223020924.000|CC1|BE HELPING THE PRESIDENT.       
20101223020924.000|20101223020926.000|CC1|A GALLUP POLL LAST WEEK SHOWED

20101223020941.000|20101223020942.000|CC1|PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT READ TOO   
20101223020942.000|20101223020943.000|CC1|MUCH INTO HIS VICTORIES.        
20101223020943.000|20101223020945.000|CC1|"REPUBLICANS," HE SAID, "WILL

20101223020957.000|20101223020959.000|CC1|>> IF THERE'S ANY LESSON TO DRAW
20101223020959.000|20101223021001.000|CC1|FROM THESE PAST FEW WEEKS, IT'S 
20101223021001.000|20101223021002.000|CC1|THAT WE ARE NOT DOOMED TO       
20101223021002.000|20101223021004.000|CC1|ENDLESS GRIDLOCK.               
20101223021004.000|20101223021006.000|CC1|WE'VE SHOWN IN THE WAKE OF THE  
20101223021006.000|20101223021007.000|CC1|NOVEMBER ELECTIONS THAT WE HAVE 
20101223021007.000|20101223021010.000|CC1|THE CAPACITY NOT ONLY TO MAKE   
20101223021010.000|20101223021010.000|CC1|PROGRESS, BUT TO MAKE PROGRESS

20101223021013.000|20101223021015.000|CC1|AND I'M NOT NAIVE.              
20101223021015.000|20101223021017.000|CC1|I KNOW THERE WILL BE TOUGH      
20101223021017.000|20101223021019.000|CC1|FIGHTS IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.     
20101223021019.000|20101223021020.000|CC1|BUT MY HOPE HEADING INTO THE NEW
20101223021020.000|20101223021022.000|CC1|YEAR IS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO 
20101223021022.000|20101223021023.000|CC1|HEED THE MESSAGE OF THE AMERICAN

20101223021028.000|20101223021031.000|CC1|AND IF WE DO THAT, I'M CONVINCED
20101223021031.000|20101223021033.000|CC1|THAT WE WILL LIFT UP OUR MIDDLE

20101223021101.000|20101223021102.000|CC1|SUSAN, IS THAT WHAT WE SAW?     
20101223021102.000|20101223021104.000|CC1|>> I THINK WE SAW A REMARKABLE  
20101223021104.000|20101223021105.000|CC1|PROGRESS IN DECEMBER.           
20101223021105.000|20101223021106.000|CC1|THE PRESIDENT HAD A BAD NOVEMBER
20101223021106.000|20101223021108.000|CC1|HAD A PRETTY GOOD DECEMBER,     
20101223021108.000|20101223021110.000|CC1|BETTER THAN MOST OF US EXPECTED.
20101223021110.000|20101223021111.000|CC1|BUT THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY   
20101223021111.000|20101223021113.000|CC1|MEAN JANUARY IS GOING TO BE     
20101223021113.000|20101223021113.000|CC1|BETTER.                         
20101223021113.000|20101223021114.000|CC1|IT WILL BE A DIFFERENT POLITICAL

20101223021116.000|20101223021117.000|CC1|COMES IN IN JANUARY.            
20101223021117.000|20101223021119.000|CC1|SO HE SHOULD SAVOR THESE MOMENTS
20101223021119.000|20101223021120.000|CC1|OF VICTORY TODAY.               
20101223021120.000|20101223021121.000|CC1|>> Ifill: OF THE THREE BIG      
20101223021121.000|20101223021122.000|CC1|VICTORIES, "DON'T ASK DON'T

20101223021129.000|20101223021132.000|CC1|>> I THINK THIS VINDICATES THE  
20101223021132.000|20101223021133.000|CC1|DECISION THAT THEY MADE TO TAKE 
20101223021133.000|20101223021136.000|CC1|THE TAX CUT DEAL THEY COULD GET 
20101223021136.000|20101223021137.000|CC1|QUICKLY AND NOT STAGE THE KIND  
20101223021137.000|20101223021139.000|CC1|OF PUBLIC BATTLE THAT A LOT OF  
20101223021139.000|20101223021140.000|CC1|LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WANTED TO     
20101223021140.000|20101223021142.000|CC1|HAVE, AND THAT WAS TO PROTECT I

20101223021154.000|20101223021157.000|CC1|BIG SIGNAL TO THE PRESIDENT'S   
20101223021157.000|20101223021158.000|CC1|FACE THAT HE HAD DELIVERED ON AN
20101223021158.000|20101223021200.000|CC1|IMPORTANT PROMISE HE MADE TO GAY
20101223021200.000|20101223021200.000|CC1|AMERICANS.                      
20101223021200.000|20101223021202.000|CC1|>> Ifill: I REMEMBER WHEN HE    
20101223021202.000|20101223021204.000|CC1|USED TO GET HECKLED SAYING HE   
20101223021204.000|20101223021206.000|CC1|WASN'T DOING ENOUGH PASSING ON  
20101223021206.000|20101223021206.000|CC1|THAT ISSUE.                     
20101223021206.000|20101223021207.000|CC1|WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT    
20101223021207.000|20101223021209.000|CC1|AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN       
20101223021209.000|20101223021210.000|CC1|DEMANDING, WHAT MESSAGES THEY   
20101223021210.000|20101223021212.000|CC1|WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE SENT      
20101223021212.000|20101223021214.000|CC1|DURING THIS ELECTION, HOW DOES  
20101223021214.000|20101223021215.000|CC1|WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE     
20101223021215.000|20101223021216.000|CC1|MIDTERM SQUARE WITH THAT?       
20101223021216.000|20101223021217.000|CC1|>> I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC  
20101223021217.000|20101223021219.000|CC1|WILL BE SURPRISED BY WHAT       
20101223021219.000|20101223021220.000|CC1|THEY'VE SEEN IN DECEMBER. WHEN  
20101223021220.000|20101223021222.000|CC1|WE ASKED THEM AFTER THE ELECTION
20101223021222.000|20101223021224.000|CC1|WHAT DID THEY WITHIN THE        
20101223021224.000|20101223021226.000|CC1|PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICANS DO,   
20101223021226.000|20101223021229.000|CC1|THEY SAID GET SOME THING DOWN.  
20101223021229.000|20101223021231.000|CC1|AND THEY SAID DO YOU THINK THEY 
20101223021231.000|20101223021233.000|CC1|WILL HAPPEN, THEY SAID NO.      
20101223021233.000|20101223021235.000|CC1|I THINK THEY WILL LOOK FAVORABLY
20101223021235.000|20101223021236.000|CC1|BOND THIS.                      
20101223021236.000|20101223021237.000|CC1|BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING 
20101223021237.000|20101223021239.000|CC1|ABOUT THESE THREE PIECES OF

20101223023223.000|20101223023224.000|CC1|BECAUSE THIS IS A COMPLICATED

20101223023244.000|20101223023245.000|CC1|HISTORICAL REASONS, BUT THAT

20101223023304.000|20101223023306.000|CC1|BUT F.D.A. HAS NEVER HAD THE

20101223023309.000|20101223023311.000|CC1|FOOD. SO THEY'VE HAD TO ASK FOR 
20101223023311.000|20101223023313.000|CC1|VOLUNTARY RECALLS AND USUALLY   
20101223023313.000|20101223023314.000|CC1|THE COMPANIES WOULD COMPLY WITH

20101223023356.000|20101223023357.000|CC1|AND WHAT CHANGES?               
20101223023357.000|20101223023359.000|CC1|>> IN THE PAST, IN FACT TO THIS 
20101223023359.000|20101223023402.000|CC1|DAY ON AVERAGE F.D.A. IS ONLY   
20101223023402.000|20101223023403.000|CC1|ABLE TO DO INSPECTIONS ABOUT    
20101223023403.000|20101223023405.000|CC1|ONCE EVERY TEN AND A HALF YEARS.
20101223023405.000|20101223023406.000|CC1|SO OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PROBLEMS  
20101223023406.000|20101223023408.000|CC1|HAVE CROPPED UP IN BETWEEN THOSE

20101223023412.000|20101223023413.000|CC1|THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE FREQUENT

20101223023428.000|20101223023429.000|CC1|OBVIOUSLY HOW EFFECTIVE THIS

20101223023432.000|20101223023433.000|CC1|THE RESOURCES THAT F.D.A. GETS  
20101223023433.000|20101223023435.000|CC1|IN THE NEXT APPROPRIATION CYCLE.

20101223023441.000|20101223023442.000|CC1|UNDERFUNED IN THIS AREA.        
20101223023442.000|20101223023444.000|CC1|IN THE RECENT FEW YEARS THERE'S

20101223023614.000|20101223023616.000|CC1|THAT WILL BACK UP THE CHAIN ALL
