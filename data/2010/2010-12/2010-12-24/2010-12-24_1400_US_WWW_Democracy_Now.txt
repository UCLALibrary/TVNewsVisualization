20101224140023.323|20101224140024.985|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Today, a 
20101224140024.985|20101224140026.647|TR0|Democracy Now! special with the 
20101224140026.647|20101224140028.309|TR0|Canadian physician and 
20101224140028.309|20101224140029.971|TR0|bestselling author Gabor Mate. 
20101224140029.971|20101224140031.633|TR0|From disease to addiction, 
20101224140031.633|20101224140033.295|TR0|parenting to attention deficit 
20101224140033.295|20101224140034.957|TR0|disorder, Dr. Mate's work 
20101224140034.957|20101224140036.619|TR0|focuses on the centrality of 
20101224140036.619|20101224140038.281|TR0|early childhood experiences to 
20101224140038.281|20101224140039.943|TR0|the development of the brain, 
20101224140039.943|20101224140041.605|TR0|and how those experiences can 
20101224140041.605|20101224140043.267|TR0|impact everything from 
20101224140043.267|20101224140044.929|TR0|behavioral patterns to physical 
20101224140044.929|20101224140046.591|TR0|and mental illness. While the 
20101224140046.591|20101224140048.253|TR0|relationship between emotional 
20101224140048.253|20101224140049.915|TR0|stress and disease, and mental 
20101224140049.915|20101224140051.577|TR0|and physical health more 
20101224140051.577|20101224140053.239|TR0|broadly, is often considered 
20101224140053.239|20101224140054.900|TR0|controversial within medical 
20101224140054.900|20101224140056.562|TR0|orthodoxy, Dr. Mate argues too 
20101224140056.562|20101224140058.224|TR0|many doctors seem to have 
20101224140058.224|20101224140059.886|TR0|forgotten what was once a 
20101224140059.886|20101224140101.548|TR0|commonplace assumption, that 
20101224140101.548|20101224140103.210|TR0|emotions are deeply implicated 
20101224140103.210|20101224140104.872|TR0|in both the development of 
20101224140104.872|20101224140106.534|TR0|illness, addictions and 
20101224140106.534|20101224140108.196|TR0|disorders, and in their healing.

20101224140109.858|20101224140111.520|TR0|Dr. Mate is the bestselling 
20101224140111.520|20101224140113.182|TR0|author of four books: When the

20101224140133.125|20101224140134.787|TR0|Today we bring you all three of 
20101224140134.787|20101224140136.449|TR0|our interviews with Dr. Mate in 
20101224140136.449|20101224140138.111|TR0|2010. In our first conversation, 
20101224140138.111|20101224140139.773|TR0|Dr. Mate talked about his work 
20101224140139.773|20101224140141.435|TR0|as the staff physician at the 
20101224140141.435|20101224140143.097|TR0|Portland Hotel in Vancouver, 
20101224140143.097|20101224140144.759|TR0|Canada, a residence and harm 
20101224140144.759|20101224140146.421|TR0|reduction facility in Downtown 
20101224140146.421|20101224140148.083|TR0|Eastside, a neighborhood with 
20101224140148.083|20101224140149.745|TR0|one the densest concentrations 
20101224140149.745|20101224140151.407|TR0|of drug addicts in North 
20101224140151.407|20101224140153.069|TR0|America. The Portland hosts the 
20101224140153.069|20101224140154.731|TR0|only legal injection site in 
20101224140154.731|20101224140156.393|TR0|North America, a center that's 
20101224140156.393|20101224140158.055|TR0|come under fire from Canada's 
20101224140158.055|20101224140159.717|TR0|Conservative government. I asked 
20101224140159.717|20101224140201.379|TR0|Dr. Mate to talk about his 
20101224140201.379|20101224140203.040|TR0|patients.
20101224140203.040|20101224140204.702|TR0|
20101224140204.702|20101224140206.364|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: The hardcore 
20101224140206.364|20101224140208.026|TR0|drug addicts that I treat, but 
20101224140208.026|20101224140209.688|TR0|according to all studies in the 
20101224140209.688|20101224140211.350|TR0|States, as well, are, without 
20101224140211.350|20101224140213.012|TR0|exception, people who have had 
20101224140213.012|20101224140214.674|TR0|extraordinarily difficult lives. 
20101224140214.674|20101224140216.336|TR0|And the commonality is childhood 
20101224140216.336|20101224140217.998|TR0|abuse. In other words, these 
20101224140217.998|20101224140219.660|TR0|people all enter life under 
20101224140219.660|20101224140221.322|TR0|extremely adverse circumstances. 
20101224140221.322|20101224140222.984|TR0|Not only did they not get what 
20101224140222.984|20101224140224.646|TR0|they need for healthy 
20101224140224.646|20101224140226.308|TR0|development, they actually got 
20101224140226.308|20101224140227.970|TR0|negative circumstances of 
20101224140227.970|20101224140229.632|TR0|neglect. I don't have a single 
20101224140229.632|20101224140231.294|TR0|female patient in the Downtown 
20101224140231.294|20101224140232.956|TR0|Eastside who wasn't sexually 
20101224140232.956|20101224140234.618|TR0|abused, for example, as were 
20101224140234.618|20101224140236.279|TR0|many of the men, or abused, 
20101224140236.279|20101224140237.941|TR0|neglected and abandoned 
20101224140237.941|20101224140239.603|TR0|serially, over and over again.
20101224140239.603|20101224140241.265|TR0|
20101224140241.265|20101224140242.927|TR0|And that's what sets up the 
20101224140242.927|20101224140244.589|TR0|brain biology of addiction. In 
20101224140244.589|20101224140246.251|TR0|other words, the addiction is 
20101224140246.251|20101224140247.913|TR0|related both psychologically, in 
20101224140247.913|20101224140249.575|TR0|terms of emotional pain relief, 
20101224140249.575|20101224140251.237|TR0|and neurobiological development 
20101224140251.237|20101224140252.899|TR0|to early adversity.
20101224140252.899|20101224140254.561|TR0|
20101224140254.561|20101224140256.223|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What does the 
20101224140256.223|20101224140257.885|TR0|title of your book mean, In the 
20101224140257.885|20101224140259.547|TR0|Realm of Hungry Ghosts?
20101224140259.547|20101224140301.209|TR0|
20101224140301.209|20101224140302.871|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, it's a 
20101224140302.871|20101224140304.533|TR0|Buddhist phrase. In the 
20101224140304.533|20101224140306.195|TR0|Buddhists' psychology, there are 
20101224140306.195|20101224140307.857|TR0|a number of realms that human 
20101224140307.857|20101224140309.519|TR0|beings cycle through, all of us. 
20101224140309.519|20101224140311.180|TR0|One is the human realm, which is 
20101224140311.180|20101224140312.842|TR0|our ordinary selves. The hell 
20101224140312.842|20101224140314.504|TR0|realm is that of unbearable 
20101224140314.504|20101224140316.166|TR0|rage, fear, you know, these 
20101224140316.166|20101224140317.828|TR0|emotions that are difficult to 
20101224140317.828|20101224140319.490|TR0|handle. The animal realm is our 
20101224140319.490|20101224140321.152|TR0|instincts and our id and our 
20101224140321.152|20101224140322.814|TR0|passions.
20101224140322.814|20101224140324.476|TR0|
20101224140324.476|20101224140326.138|TR0|Now, the hungry ghost realm, the 
20101224140326.138|20101224140327.800|TR0|creatures in it are depicted as 
20101224140327.800|20101224140329.462|TR0|people with large empty bellies, 
20101224140329.462|20101224140331.124|TR0|small mouths and scrawny thin 
20101224140331.124|20101224140332.786|TR0|necks. They can never get enough 
20101224140332.786|20101224140334.448|TR0|satisfaction. They can never 
20101224140334.448|20101224140336.110|TR0|fill their bellies. They're 
20101224140336.110|20101224140337.772|TR0|always hungry, always empty, 
20101224140337.772|20101224140339.434|TR0|always seeking it from the 
20101224140339.434|20101224140341.096|TR0|outside. That speaks to a part 
20101224140341.096|20101224140342.758|TR0|of us that I have and everybody 
20101224140342.758|20101224140344.419|TR0|in our society has, where we 
20101224140344.419|20101224140346.081|TR0|want satisfaction from the 
20101224140346.081|20101224140347.743|TR0|outside, where we're empty, 
20101224140347.743|20101224140349.405|TR0|where we want to be soothed by 
20101224140349.405|20101224140351.067|TR0|something in the short term, but 
20101224140351.067|20101224140352.729|TR0|we can never feel that or 
20101224140352.729|20101224140354.391|TR0|fulfill that insatiety from the 
20101224140354.391|20101224140356.053|TR0|outside. The addicts are in that 
20101224140356.053|20101224140357.715|TR0|realm all the time. Most of us 
20101224140357.715|20101224140359.377|TR0|are in that realm some of the 
20101224140359.377|20101224140401.039|TR0|time. And my point really is, is 
20101224140401.039|20101224140402.701|TR0|that there's no clear 
20101224140402.701|20101224140404.363|TR0|distinction between the 
20101224140404.363|20101224140406.025|TR0|identified addict and the rest 
20101224140406.025|20101224140407.687|TR0|of us. There's just a continuum 
20101224140407.687|20101224140409.349|TR0|in which we all may be found. 
20101224140409.349|20101224140411.011|TR0|They're on it, because they've 
20101224140411.011|20101224140412.673|TR0|suffered a lot more than most of 
20101224140412.673|20101224140414.335|TR0|us.
20101224140414.335|20101224140415.997|TR0|
20101224140415.997|20101224140417.658|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20101224140417.658|20101224140419.320|TR0|about the biology of addiction?
20101224140419.320|20101224140420.982|TR0|
20101224140420.982|20101224140422.644|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: For sure. You 
20101224140422.644|20101224140424.306|TR0|see, if you look at the brain 
20101224140424.306|20101224140425.968|TR0|circuits involved in addiction - 
20101224140425.968|20101224140427.630|TR0|and that's true whether it's a 
20101224140427.630|20101224140429.292|TR0|shopping addiction like mine or 
20101224140429.292|20101224140430.954|TR0|an addiction to opiates like the 
20101224140430.954|20101224140432.616|TR0|heroin addict - we're looking 
20101224140432.616|20101224140434.278|TR0|for endorphins in our brains. 
20101224140434.278|20101224140435.940|TR0|Endorphins are the brain's feel 
20101224140435.940|20101224140437.602|TR0|good, reward, pleasure and pain 
20101224140437.602|20101224140439.264|TR0|relief chemicals. They also 
20101224140439.264|20101224140440.926|TR0|happen to be the love chemicals 
20101224140440.926|20101224140442.588|TR0|that connect us to the universe 
20101224140442.588|20101224140444.250|TR0|and to one another.
20101224140444.250|20101224140445.912|TR0|
20101224140445.912|20101224140447.574|TR0|Now, that circuitry in addicts 
20101224140447.574|20101224140449.236|TR0|doesn't function very well, as 
20101224140449.236|20101224140450.898|TR0|the circuitry of incentive and 
20101224140450.898|20101224140452.559|TR0|motivation, which involves the 
20101224140452.559|20101224140454.221|TR0|chemical dopamine, also doesn't 
20101224140454.221|20101224140455.883|TR0|function very well. Stimulant 
20101224140455.883|20101224140457.545|TR0|drugs like cocaine and crystal 
20101224140457.545|20101224140459.207|TR0|meth, nicotine and caffeine, all 
20101224140459.207|20101224140500.869|TR0|elevate dopamine levels in the 
20101224140500.869|20101224140502.531|TR0|brain, as does sexual acting 
20101224140502.531|20101224140504.193|TR0|out, as does extreme sports, as 
20101224140504.193|20101224140505.855|TR0|does workaholism and so on.
20101224140505.855|20101224140507.517|TR0|
20101224140507.517|20101224140509.179|TR0|Now, the issue is, why do these 
20101224140509.179|20101224140510.841|TR0|circuits not work so well in 
20101224140510.841|20101224140512.503|TR0|some people, because the drugs 
20101224140512.503|20101224140514.165|TR0|in themselves are not 
20101224140514.165|20101224140515.827|TR0|surprisingly addictive. And what 
20101224140515.827|20101224140517.489|TR0|I mean by that is, is that most 
20101224140517.489|20101224140519.151|TR0|people who try most drugs never 
20101224140519.151|20101224140520.813|TR0|become addicted to them. And so, 
20101224140520.813|20101224140522.475|TR0|there has to be susceptibility 
20101224140522.475|20101224140524.137|TR0|there. And the susceptible 
20101224140524.137|20101224140525.798|TR0|people are the ones with these 
20101224140525.798|20101224140527.460|TR0|impaired brain circuits, and the 
20101224140527.460|20101224140529.122|TR0|impairment is caused by early 
20101224140529.122|20101224140530.784|TR0|adversity, rather than by 
20101224140530.784|20101224140532.446|TR0|genetics.
20101224140532.446|20101224140534.108|TR0|
20101224140534.108|20101224140535.770|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What do you 
20101224140535.770|20101224140537.432|TR0|mean, "early adversity"?
20101224140537.432|20101224140539.094|TR0|
20101224140539.094|20101224140540.756|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, the 
20101224140540.756|20101224140542.418|TR0|human brain, unlike any other 
20101224140542.418|20101224140544.080|TR0|mammal, for the most part 
20101224140544.080|20101224140545.742|TR0|develops under the influence of 
20101224140545.742|20101224140547.404|TR0|the environment. And that's 
20101224140547.404|20101224140549.066|TR0|because, from the evolutionary 
20101224140549.066|20101224140550.728|TR0|point of view, we developed 
20101224140550.728|20101224140552.390|TR0|these large heads, large 
20101224140552.390|20101224140554.052|TR0|fore-brains, and to walk on two 
20101224140554.052|20101224140555.714|TR0|legs we have a narrow pelvis. 
20101224140555.714|20101224140557.376|TR0|That means - large head, narrow 
20101224140557.376|20101224140559.038|TR0|pelvis - we have to be born 
20101224140559.038|20101224140600.699|TR0|prematurely. Otherwise, we would 
20101224140600.699|20101224140602.361|TR0|never get born. The head already 
20101224140602.361|20101224140604.023|TR0|is the biggest part of the body. 
20101224140604.023|20101224140605.685|TR0|Now, the horse can run on the 
20101224140605.685|20101224140607.347|TR0|first day of life. Human beings 
20101224140607.347|20101224140609.009|TR0|aren't that developed for two 
20101224140609.009|20101224140610.671|TR0|years. That means much of our 
20101224140610.671|20101224140612.333|TR0|brain development, that in other 
20101224140612.333|20101224140613.995|TR0|animals occurs safely in the 
20101224140613.995|20101224140615.657|TR0|uterus, for us has to occur out 
20101224140615.657|20101224140617.319|TR0|there in the environment. And 
20101224140617.319|20101224140618.981|TR0|which circuits develop and which 
20101224140618.981|20101224140620.643|TR0|don't depend very much on 
20101224140620.643|20101224140622.305|TR0|environmental input.
20101224140622.305|20101224140623.967|TR0|
20101224140623.967|20101224140625.629|TR0|When people are mistreated, 
20101224140625.629|20101224140627.291|TR0|stressed or abused, their brains 
20101224140627.291|20101224140628.953|TR0|don't develop the way they ought 
20101224140628.953|20101224140630.615|TR0|to. It's that simple. And 
20101224140630.615|20101224140632.277|TR0|unfortunately, my profession, 
20101224140632.277|20101224140633.938|TR0|the medical profession, puts all 
20101224140633.938|20101224140635.600|TR0|the emphasis on genetics rather 
20101224140635.600|20101224140637.262|TR0|than on the environment, which, 
20101224140637.262|20101224140638.924|TR0|of course, is a simple 
20101224140638.924|20101224140640.586|TR0|explanation. It also takes 
20101224140640.586|20101224140642.248|TR0|everybody off the hook.
20101224140642.248|20101224140643.910|TR0|
20101224140643.910|20101224140645.572|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What do you 
20101224140645.572|20101224140647.234|TR0|mean, it takes people off the 
20101224140647.234|20101224140648.896|TR0|hook?
20101224140648.896|20101224140650.558|TR0|
20101224140650.558|20101224140652.220|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, if 
20101224140652.220|20101224140653.882|TR0|people's behaviors and 
20101224140653.882|20101224140655.544|TR0|dysfunctions are regulated, 
20101224140655.544|20101224140657.206|TR0|controlled and determined by 
20101224140657.206|20101224140658.868|TR0|genes, we don't have to look at 
20101224140658.868|20101224140700.530|TR0|child welfare policies, we don't 
20101224140700.530|20101224140702.192|TR0|have to look at the kind of 
20101224140702.192|20101224140703.854|TR0|support that we give to pregnant 
20101224140703.854|20101224140705.516|TR0|women, we don't have to look at 
20101224140705.516|20101224140707.177|TR0|the kind of non-support that we 
20101224140707.177|20101224140708.839|TR0|give to families, so that, you 
20101224140708.839|20101224140710.501|TR0|know, most children in North 
20101224140710.501|20101224140712.163|TR0|America now have to be away from 
20101224140712.163|20101224140713.825|TR0|their parents from an early age 
20101224140713.825|20101224140715.487|TR0|on because of economic 
20101224140715.487|20101224140717.149|TR0|considerations. And especially 
20101224140717.149|20101224140718.811|TR0|in the States, because of the 
20101224140718.811|20101224140720.473|TR0|welfare laws, women are forced 
20101224140720.473|20101224140722.135|TR0|to go find low-paying jobs far 
20101224140722.135|20101224140723.797|TR0|away from home, often single 
20101224140723.797|20101224140725.459|TR0|women, and not see their kids 
20101224140725.459|20101224140727.121|TR0|for most of the day. Under those 
20101224140727.121|20101224140728.783|TR0|conditions, kids' brains don't 
20101224140728.783|20101224140730.445|TR0|develop the way they need to.
20101224140730.445|20101224140732.107|TR0|
20101224140732.107|20101224140733.769|TR0|And so, if it's all caused by 
20101224140733.769|20101224140735.431|TR0|genetics, we don't have to look 
20101224140735.431|20101224140737.093|TR0|at those social policies; we 
20101224140737.093|20101224140738.755|TR0|don't have to look at our 
20101224140738.755|20101224140740.417|TR0|politics that disadvantage 
20101224140740.417|20101224140742.078|TR0|certain minority groups, so 
20101224140742.078|20101224140743.740|TR0|cause them more stress, cause 
20101224140743.740|20101224140745.402|TR0|them more pain, in other words, 
20101224140745.402|20101224140747.064|TR0|more predisposition for 
20101224140747.064|20101224140748.726|TR0|addictions; we don't have to 
20101224140748.726|20101224140750.388|TR0|look at economic inequalities. 
20101224140750.388|20101224140752.050|TR0|If it's all genes, it's all - 
20101224140752.050|20101224140753.712|TR0|we're all innocent, and society 
20101224140753.712|20101224140755.374|TR0|doesn't have to take a hard look 
20101224140755.374|20101224140757.036|TR0|at its own attitudes and 
20101224140757.036|20101224140758.698|TR0|policies.
20101224140758.698|20101224140800.360|TR0|
20101224140800.360|20101224140802.022|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20101224140802.022|20101224140803.684|TR0|about this whole approach of 
20101224140803.684|20101224140805.346|TR0|criminalization versus harm 
20101224140805.346|20101224140807.008|TR0|reduction, how you think addicts 
20101224140807.008|20101224140808.670|TR0|should be treated, and how they 
20101224140808.670|20101224140810.332|TR0|are, in the United States and 
20101224140810.332|20101224140811.994|TR0|Canada?
20101224140811.994|20101224140813.656|TR0|
20101224140813.656|20101224140815.317|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, the 
20101224140815.317|20101224140816.979|TR0|first point to get there is that 
20101224140816.979|20101224140818.641|TR0|if people who become severe 
20101224140818.641|20101224140820.303|TR0|addicts, as shown by all the 
20101224140820.303|20101224140821.965|TR0|studies, were for the most part 
20101224140821.965|20101224140823.627|TR0|abused children, then we realize 
20101224140823.627|20101224140825.289|TR0|that the war on drugs is 
20101224140825.289|20101224140826.951|TR0|actually waged against people 
20101224140826.951|20101224140828.613|TR0|that were abused from the moment 
20101224140828.613|20101224140830.275|TR0|they were born, or from an early 
20101224140830.275|20101224140831.937|TR0|age on. In other words, we're 
20101224140831.937|20101224140833.599|TR0|punishing people for having been 
20101224140833.599|20101224140835.261|TR0|abused. That's the first point.
20101224140835.261|20101224140836.923|TR0|
20101224140836.923|20101224140838.585|TR0|The second point is, is that the 
20101224140838.585|20101224140840.247|TR0|research clearly shows that the 
20101224140840.247|20101224140841.909|TR0|biggest driver of addictive 
20101224140841.909|20101224140843.571|TR0|relapse and addictive behavior 
20101224140843.571|20101224140845.233|TR0|is actually stress. In North 
20101224140845.233|20101224140846.895|TR0|America right now, because of 
20101224140846.895|20101224140848.557|TR0|the economic crisis, a lot of 
20101224140848.557|20101224140850.218|TR0|people are eating junk food, 
20101224140850.218|20101224140851.880|TR0|because junk foods release 
20101224140851.880|20101224140853.542|TR0|endorphins and dopamine in the 
20101224140853.542|20101224140855.204|TR0|brain. So that stress drives 
20101224140855.204|20101224140856.866|TR0|addiction.
20101224140856.866|20101224140858.528|TR0|
20101224140858.528|20101224140900.190|TR0|Now imagine a situation where 
20101224140900.190|20101224140901.852|TR0|we're trying to figure out how 
20101224140901.852|20101224140903.514|TR0|to help addicts. Would we come 
20101224140903.514|20101224140905.176|TR0|up with a system that stresses 
20101224140905.176|20101224140906.838|TR0|them to the max? Who would 
20101224140906.838|20101224140908.500|TR0|design a system that ostracizes, 
20101224140908.500|20101224140910.162|TR0|marginalizes, impoverishes and 
20101224140910.162|20101224140911.824|TR0|ensures the disease of the 
20101224140911.824|20101224140913.486|TR0|addict, and hope, through that 
20101224140913.486|20101224140915.148|TR0|system, to rehabilitate large 
20101224140915.148|20101224140916.810|TR0|numbers? It can't be done. In 
20101224140916.810|20101224140918.472|TR0|other words, the so-called "war 
20101224140918.472|20101224140920.134|TR0|on drugs," which, as the new 
20101224140920.134|20101224140921.796|TR0|drug czar points out, is a war 
20101224140921.796|20101224140923.457|TR0|on people, actually entrenches 
20101224140923.457|20101224140925.119|TR0|addiction deeply. Furthermore, 
20101224140925.119|20101224140926.781|TR0|it institutionalizes people in 
20101224140926.781|20101224140928.443|TR0|facilities where the care is 
20101224140928.443|20101224140930.105|TR0|very - there's no care. We call 
20101224140930.105|20101224140931.767|TR0|it a "correctional" system, but 
20101224140931.767|20101224140933.429|TR0|it doesn't correct anything. 
20101224140933.429|20101224140935.091|TR0|It's a punitive system. So 
20101224140935.091|20101224140936.753|TR0|people suffer more, and then 
20101224140936.753|20101224140938.415|TR0|they come out, and of course 
20101224140938.415|20101224140940.077|TR0|they're more entrenched in their 
20101224140940.077|20101224140941.739|TR0|addiction than they were when 
20101224140941.739|20101224140943.401|TR0|they went in.
20101224140943.401|20101224140945.063|TR0|
20101224140945.063|20101224140946.725|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I'm curious 
20101224140946.725|20101224140948.387|TR0|about your own history, Gabor 
20101224140948.387|20101224140950.049|TR0|Mate.
20101224140950.049|20101224140951.711|TR0|
20101224140951.711|20101224140953.373|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Yeah.
20101224140953.373|20101224140955.035|TR0|
20101224140955.035|20101224140956.696|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You were born in 
20101224140956.696|20101224140958.358|TR0|Nazi-occupied Hungary?
20101224140958.358|20101224141000.020|TR0|
20101224141000.020|20101224141001.682|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, ADD has 
20101224141001.682|20101224141003.344|TR0|a lot to do with that. I have 
20101224141003.344|20101224141005.006|TR0|attention deficit disorder 
20101224141005.006|20101224141006.668|TR0|myself. And again, most people 
20101224141006.668|20101224141008.330|TR0|see it as a genetic problem. I 
20101224141008.330|20101224141009.992|TR0|don't. It actually has to do 
20101224141009.992|20101224141011.654|TR0|with those factors of brain 
20101224141011.654|20101224141013.316|TR0|development, which in my case 
20101224141013.316|20101224141014.978|TR0|occurred as a Jewish infant 
20101224141014.978|20101224141016.640|TR0|under Nazi occupation in the 
20101224141016.640|20101224141018.302|TR0|ghetto of Budapest. And the day 
20101224141018.302|20101224141019.964|TR0|after the pediatrician - sorry, 
20101224141019.964|20101224141021.626|TR0|the day after the Nazis marched 
20101224141021.626|20101224141023.288|TR0|into Budapest in March of 1944, 
20101224141023.288|20101224141024.950|TR0|my mother called the 
20101224141024.950|20101224141026.612|TR0|pediatrician and says, "Would 
20101224141026.612|20101224141028.274|TR0|you please come and see my son, 
20101224141028.274|20101224141029.936|TR0|because he's crying all the 
20101224141029.936|20101224141031.597|TR0|time?" And the pediatrician 
20101224141031.597|20101224141033.259|TR0|says, "Of course I'll come. But 
20101224141033.259|20101224141034.921|TR0|I should tell you, all my Jewish 
20101224141034.921|20101224141036.583|TR0|babies are crying."
20101224141036.583|20101224141038.245|TR0|
20101224141038.245|20101224141039.907|TR0|Now infants don't know anything 
20101224141039.907|20101224141041.569|TR0|about Nazis and genocide or war 
20101224141041.569|20101224141043.231|TR0|or Hitler. They're picking up on 
20101224141043.231|20101224141044.893|TR0|the stresses of their parents. 
20101224141044.893|20101224141046.555|TR0|And, of course, my mother was an 
20101224141046.555|20101224141048.217|TR0|intensely stressed person, her 
20101224141048.217|20101224141049.879|TR0|husband being away in forced 
20101224141049.879|20101224141051.541|TR0|labor, her parents shortly 
20101224141051.541|20101224141053.203|TR0|thereafter being departed and 
20101224141053.203|20101224141054.865|TR0|killed in Auschwitz. Under those 
20101224141054.865|20101224141056.527|TR0|conditions, I don't have the 
20101224141056.527|20101224141058.189|TR0|kind of conditions that I need 
20101224141058.189|20101224141059.851|TR0|for the proper development of my 
20101224141059.851|20101224141101.513|TR0|brain circuits. And 
20101224141101.513|20101224141103.175|TR0|particularly, how does an infant 
20101224141103.175|20101224141104.836|TR0|deal with that much stress? By 
20101224141104.836|20101224141106.498|TR0|tuning it out. That's the only 
20101224141106.498|20101224141108.160|TR0|way the brain can deal with it. 
20101224141108.160|20101224141109.822|TR0|And when you do that, that 
20101224141109.822|20101224141111.484|TR0|becomes programmed into the 
20101224141111.484|20101224141113.146|TR0|brain.
20101224141113.146|20101224141114.808|TR0|
20101224141114.808|20101224141116.470|TR0|And so, if you look at the 
20101224141116.470|20101224141118.132|TR0|preponderance of ADD in North 
20101224141118.132|20101224141119.794|TR0|America now and the three 
20101224141119.794|20101224141121.456|TR0|millions of kids in the States 
20101224141121.456|20101224141123.118|TR0|that are on stimulant medication 
20101224141123.118|20101224141124.780|TR0|and the half-a-million who are 
20101224141124.780|20101224141126.442|TR0|on anti-psychotics, what they're 
20101224141126.442|20101224141128.104|TR0|really exhibiting is the effects 
20101224141128.104|20101224141129.766|TR0|of extreme stress, increasing 
20101224141129.766|20101224141131.428|TR0|stress in our society, on the 
20101224141131.428|20101224141133.090|TR0|parenting environment. Not bad 
20101224141133.090|20101224141134.752|TR0|parenting. Extremely stressed 
20101224141134.752|20101224141136.414|TR0|parenting, because of social and 
20101224141136.414|20101224141138.076|TR0|economic conditions. And that's 
20101224141138.076|20101224141139.737|TR0|why we're seeing such a 
20101224141139.737|20101224141141.399|TR0|preponderance.
20101224141141.399|20101224141143.061|TR0|
20101224141143.061|20101224141144.723|TR0|So, in my case, that also set up 
20101224141144.723|20101224141146.385|TR0|this sense of never being 
20101224141146.385|20101224141148.047|TR0|soothed, of never having enough, 
20101224141148.047|20101224141149.709|TR0|because I was a starving infant. 
20101224141149.709|20101224141151.371|TR0|And that means, all my life, I 
20101224141151.371|20101224141153.033|TR0|have this propensity to soothe 
20101224141153.033|20101224141154.695|TR0|myself. How do I do that? Well, 
20101224141154.695|20101224141156.357|TR0|one way is to work a lot and to 
20101224141156.357|20101224141158.019|TR0|gets lots of admiration and lots 
20101224141158.019|20101224141159.681|TR0|of respect and people wanting 
20101224141159.681|20101224141201.343|TR0|me. If you get the impression 
20101224141201.343|20101224141203.005|TR0|early in life that the world 
20101224141203.005|20101224141204.667|TR0|doesn't want you, then you're 
20101224141204.667|20101224141206.329|TR0|going to make yourself wanted 
20101224141206.329|20101224141207.991|TR0|and indispensable. And people do 
20101224141207.991|20101224141209.653|TR0|that through work. I did it 
20101224141209.653|20101224141211.315|TR0|through being a medical doctor. 
20101224141211.315|20101224141212.976|TR0|I also have this propensity to 
20101224141212.976|20101224141214.638|TR0|soothe myself through shopping, 
20101224141214.638|20101224141216.300|TR0|especially when I'm stressed, 
20101224141216.300|20101224141217.962|TR0|and I happen to shop for 
20101224141217.962|20101224141219.624|TR0|classical compact music. But it 
20101224141219.624|20101224141221.286|TR0|goes back to this insatiable 
20101224141221.286|20101224141222.948|TR0|need of the infant who is not 
20101224141222.948|20101224141224.610|TR0|soothed, and they have to 
20101224141224.610|20101224141226.272|TR0|develop, or their brain develop, 
20101224141226.272|20101224141227.934|TR0|these self-soothing strategies.
20101224141227.934|20101224141229.596|TR0|
20101224141229.596|20101224141231.258|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: How do you think 
20101224141231.258|20101224141232.920|TR0|kids with ADD, with attention 
20101224141232.920|20101224141234.582|TR0|deficit disorder, should be 
20101224141234.582|20101224141236.244|TR0|treated?
20101224141236.244|20101224141237.906|TR0|
20101224141237.906|20101224141239.568|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, if we 
20101224141239.568|20101224141241.230|TR0|recognize that it's not a 
20101224141241.230|20101224141242.892|TR0|disease and it's not genetic, 
20101224141242.892|20101224141244.554|TR0|but it's a problem of brain 
20101224141244.554|20101224141246.215|TR0|development, and knowing the 
20101224141246.215|20101224141247.877|TR0|good news, fortunately - and 
20101224141247.877|20101224141249.539|TR0|this is also true for addicts - 
20101224141249.539|20101224141251.201|TR0|that the brain, the human brain, 
20101224141251.201|20101224141252.863|TR0|can develop new circuits even 
20101224141252.863|20101224141254.525|TR0|later on in life - and that's 
20101224141254.525|20101224141256.187|TR0|called neuroplasticity, the 
20101224141256.187|20101224141257.849|TR0|capacity of the brain to be 
20101224141257.849|20101224141259.511|TR0|molded by new experience later 
20101224141259.511|20101224141301.173|TR0|in life - then the question 
20101224141301.173|20101224141302.835|TR0|becomes not of how to regulate 
20101224141302.835|20101224141304.497|TR0|and control symptoms, but how do 
20101224141304.497|20101224141306.159|TR0|you promote development. And 
20101224141306.159|20101224141307.821|TR0|that has to do with providing 
20101224141307.821|20101224141309.483|TR0|kids with the kind of 
20101224141309.483|20101224141311.145|TR0|environment and nurturing that 
20101224141311.145|20101224141312.807|TR0|they need so that those circuits 
20101224141312.807|20101224141314.469|TR0|can develop later on.
20101224141314.469|20101224141316.131|TR0|
20101224141316.131|20101224141317.793|TR0|That's also, by the way, what 
20101224141317.793|20101224141319.455|TR0|the addict needs. So instead of 
20101224141319.455|20101224141321.116|TR0|a punitive approach, we need to 
20101224141321.116|20101224141322.778|TR0|have a much more compassionate, 
20101224141322.778|20101224141324.440|TR0|caring approach that would allow

20101224141326.102|20101224141327.764|TR0|the development is stuck at a

20101224141331.088|20101224141332.750|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You began your 
20101224141332.750|20101224141334.412|TR0|talk last night at Columbia, 
20101224141334.412|20101224141336.074|TR0|which I went to hear, at the law 
20101224141336.074|20101224141337.736|TR0|school, with a quote, and I'd 
20101224141337.736|20101224141339.398|TR0|like you to end our conversation 
20101224141339.398|20101224141341.060|TR0|with that quote.
20101224141341.060|20101224141342.722|TR0|
20101224141342.722|20101224141344.384|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Would that be 
20101224141344.384|20101224141346.046|TR0|the quote that only in the 
20101224141346.046|20101224141347.708|TR0|presence of compassion will 
20101224141347.708|20101224141349.370|TR0|people allow themselves --
20101224141349.370|20101224141351.032|TR0|

20101224141354.355|20101224141356.017|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Oh, oh, no, 
20101224141356.017|20101224141357.679|TR0|yeah, Naguib Mahfouz, the great 
20101224141357.679|20101224141359.341|TR0|Egyptian writer. He said that 
20101224141359.341|20101224141401.003|TR0|"Nothing records the effects of 
20101224141401.003|20101224141402.665|TR0|a sad life" so completely as the 
20101224141402.665|20101224141404.327|TR0|human body - "so graphically as 
20101224141404.327|20101224141405.989|TR0|the human body." And you see 
20101224141405.989|20101224141407.651|TR0|that sad life in the faces and 
20101224141407.651|20101224141409.313|TR0|bodies of my patients.

20101224141422.609|20101224141424.271|TR0|In that first interview, we 
20101224141424.271|20101224141425.933|TR0|touched briefly on his work on 
20101224141425.933|20101224141427.595|TR0|attention deficit disorder, the 
20101224141427.595|20101224141429.256|TR0|subject of his book Scattered:

20101224141432.580|20101224141434.242|TR0|about It. Well, just about a 
20101224141434.242|20101224141435.904|TR0|month ago, we had Dr. Mate back 
20101224141435.904|20101224141437.566|TR0|on Democracy Now! to talk more 
20101224141437.566|20101224141439.228|TR0|about ADD, as well as parenting, 
20101224141439.228|20101224141440.890|TR0|bullying, the education system, 
20101224141440.890|20101224141442.552|TR0|and how a litany of stresses on 
20101224141442.552|20101224141444.214|TR0|the family environment is 
20101224141444.214|20101224141445.876|TR0|leading to what he calls the 
20101224141445.876|20101224141447.538|TR0|"destruction of the American

20101224141450.862|20101224141452.524|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: In the United 
20101224141452.524|20101224141454.186|TR0|States right now, there are 
20101224141454.186|20101224141455.848|TR0|three million children receiving 
20101224141455.848|20101224141457.510|TR0|stimulant medications for ADHD.
20101224141457.510|20101224141459.172|TR0|
20101224141459.172|20101224141500.834|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: ADHD means?
20101224141500.834|20101224141502.495|TR0|
20101224141502.495|20101224141504.157|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Attention 
20101224141504.157|20101224141505.819|TR0|deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
20101224141505.819|20101224141507.481|TR0|And there are about 
20101224141507.481|20101224141509.143|TR0|half-a-million kids in this 
20101224141509.143|20101224141510.805|TR0|country receiving heavy-duty 
20101224141510.805|20101224141512.467|TR0|anti-psychotic medications, 
20101224141512.467|20101224141514.129|TR0|medications such as are usually 
20101224141514.129|20101224141515.791|TR0|given to adult schizophrenics to 
20101224141515.791|20101224141517.453|TR0|regulate their hallucinations. 
20101224141517.453|20101224141519.115|TR0|But in this case, children are 
20101224141519.115|20101224141520.777|TR0|getting it to control their 
20101224141520.777|20101224141522.439|TR0|behavior. So what we have is a 
20101224141522.439|20101224141524.101|TR0|massive social experiment of the 
20101224141524.101|20101224141525.763|TR0|chemical control of children's 
20101224141525.763|20101224141527.425|TR0|behavior, with no idea of the 
20101224141527.425|20101224141529.087|TR0|long-term consequences of these 
20101224141529.087|20101224141530.749|TR0|heavy-duty anti-psychotics on 
20101224141530.749|20101224141532.411|TR0|kids.
20101224141532.411|20101224141534.073|TR0|
20101224141534.073|20101224141535.735|TR0|And I know that Canadians 
20101224141535.735|20101224141537.396|TR0|statistics just last week showed 
20101224141537.396|20101224141539.058|TR0|that within last five years, 43 
20101224141539.058|20101224141540.720|TR0|- there's been a 43 percent 
20101224141540.720|20101224141542.382|TR0|increase in the rate of 
20101224141542.382|20101224141544.044|TR0|dispensing of stimulant 
20101224141544.044|20101224141545.706|TR0|prescriptions for ADD or ADHD, 
20101224141545.706|20101224141547.368|TR0|and most of these are going to 
20101224141547.368|20101224141549.030|TR0|boys. In other words, what we're 
20101224141549.030|20101224141550.692|TR0|seeing is an unprecedented 
20101224141550.692|20101224141552.354|TR0|burgeoning of the diagnosis. And 
20101224141552.354|20101224141554.016|TR0|I should say, really, I'm 
20101224141554.016|20101224141555.678|TR0|talking about, more broadly 
20101224141555.678|20101224141557.340|TR0|speaking, what I would call the 
20101224141557.340|20101224141559.002|TR0|destruction of American 
20101224141559.002|20101224141600.664|TR0|childhood, because ADD is just a 
20101224141600.664|20101224141602.326|TR0|template, or it's just an 
20101224141602.326|20101224141603.988|TR0|example of what's going on. In 
20101224141603.988|20101224141605.650|TR0|fact, according to a recent 
20101224141605.650|20101224141607.312|TR0|study published in the States, 
20101224141607.312|20101224141608.974|TR0|nearly half of American 
20101224141608.974|20101224141610.635|TR0|adolescents now meet some 
20101224141610.635|20101224141612.297|TR0|criteria or criteria for mental 
20101224141612.297|20101224141613.959|TR0|health disorders. So we're 
20101224141613.959|20101224141615.621|TR0|talking about a massive impact 
20101224141615.621|20101224141617.283|TR0|on our children of something in 
20101224141617.283|20101224141618.945|TR0|our culture that's just not 
20101224141618.945|20101224141620.607|TR0|being recognized.
20101224141620.607|20101224141622.269|TR0|
20101224141622.269|20101224141623.931|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Explain exactly 
20101224141623.931|20101224141625.593|TR0|what attention deficit disorder 
20101224141625.593|20101224141627.255|TR0|is, what attention deficit 
20101224141627.255|20101224141628.917|TR0|hyperactivity disorder is.
20101224141628.917|20101224141630.579|TR0|
20101224141630.579|20101224141632.241|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, 
20101224141632.241|20101224141633.903|TR0|specifically ADD is a compound 
20101224141633.903|20101224141635.565|TR0|of three categorical set of 
20101224141635.565|20101224141637.227|TR0|symptoms. One has to do with 
20101224141637.227|20101224141638.889|TR0|poor impulse control. So, these 
20101224141638.889|20101224141640.551|TR0|children have difficulty 
20101224141640.551|20101224141642.213|TR0|controlling their impulses. When 
20101224141642.213|20101224141643.874|TR0|their brain tells them to do 
20101224141643.874|20101224141645.536|TR0|something, from the lower brain 
20101224141645.536|20101224141647.198|TR0|centers, there's nothing up here 
20101224141647.198|20101224141648.860|TR0|in the cortex, which is where 
20101224141648.860|20101224141650.522|TR0|the executive functions are, 
20101224141650.522|20101224141652.184|TR0|which is where the functions are 
20101224141652.184|20101224141653.846|TR0|that are supposed to tell us 
20101224141653.846|20101224141655.508|TR0|what to do and what not to do, 
20101224141655.508|20101224141657.170|TR0|those circuits just don't work. 
20101224141657.170|20101224141658.832|TR0|So there's poor impulse control. 
20101224141658.832|20101224141700.494|TR0|They act out. They behave 
20101224141700.494|20101224141702.156|TR0|aggressively. They speak out of 
20101224141702.156|20101224141703.818|TR0|turn. They say the wrong thing. 
20101224141703.818|20101224141705.480|TR0|Adults with ADD will shop 
20101224141705.480|20101224141707.142|TR0|compulsively, or impulsively, I 
20101224141707.142|20101224141708.804|TR0|should say, and, again, behave 
20101224141708.804|20101224141710.466|TR0|in impulsive fashion. So, poor 
20101224141710.466|20101224141712.128|TR0|impulse control.
20101224141712.128|20101224141713.790|TR0|
20101224141713.790|20101224141715.452|TR0|But again, please notice that 
20101224141715.452|20101224141717.114|TR0|the impulse control problem is 
20101224141717.114|20101224141718.775|TR0|general amongst kids these days. 
20101224141718.775|20101224141720.437|TR0|In other words, it's not just 
20101224141720.437|20101224141722.099|TR0|the kids diagnosed with ADD, but 
20101224141722.099|20101224141723.761|TR0|a lot of kids. And there's a 
20101224141723.761|20101224141725.423|TR0|whole lot of new diagnoses now. 
20101224141725.423|20101224141727.085|TR0|And children are being diagnosed 
20101224141727.085|20101224141728.747|TR0|with all kinds of things. ADD is 
20101224141728.747|20101224141730.409|TR0|just one example. There's a new 
20101224141730.409|20101224141732.071|TR0|diagnosis called oppositional 
20101224141732.071|20101224141733.733|TR0|defiant disorder, which again 
20101224141733.733|20101224141735.395|TR0|has to do with behaviors and 
20101224141735.395|20101224141737.057|TR0|poor impulse control, so that 
20101224141737.057|20101224141738.719|TR0|impulse control now has become a 
20101224141738.719|20101224141740.381|TR0|problem amongst children, in 
20101224141740.381|20101224141742.043|TR0|general, not just the specific 
20101224141742.043|20101224141743.705|TR0|ones diagnosed with ADD.
20101224141743.705|20101224141745.367|TR0|
20101224141745.367|20101224141747.029|TR0|The second criteria for ADD is 
20101224141747.029|20101224141748.691|TR0|physical hyperactivity. So the 
20101224141748.691|20101224141750.353|TR0|part of the brain, again, that's 
20101224141750.353|20101224141752.014|TR0|supposed to regulate physical 
20101224141752.014|20101224141753.676|TR0|activity and keep you still 
20101224141753.676|20101224141755.338|TR0|just, again, doesn't work.
20101224141755.338|20101224141757.000|TR0|
20101224141757.000|20101224141758.662|TR0|And then, finally, in the third 
20101224141758.662|20101224141800.324|TR0|criteria is poor attention 
20101224141800.324|20101224141801.986|TR0|skills - tuning out; not paying 
20101224141801.986|20101224141803.648|TR0|attention; mind being somewhere 
20101224141803.648|20101224141805.310|TR0|else; absent-mindedness; not 
20101224141805.310|20101224141806.972|TR0|being able to focus; beginning 
20101224141806.972|20101224141808.634|TR0|to work on something, five 
20101224141808.634|20101224141810.296|TR0|minutes later the mind goes 
20101224141810.296|20101224141811.958|TR0|somewhere else. So, kind of a 
20101224141811.958|20101224141813.620|TR0|mental restlessness and the lack 
20101224141813.620|20101224141815.282|TR0|of being still, lack of being 
20101224141815.282|20101224141816.944|TR0|focused, lack of being present. 
20101224141816.944|20101224141818.606|TR0|These are the three major 
20101224141818.606|20101224141820.268|TR0|criteria of ADD.

20101224141821.930|20101224141823.592|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to 
20101224141823.592|20101224141825.254|TR0|this point that you just raised 
20101224141825.254|20101224141826.915|TR0|about the destruction of 
20101224141826.915|20101224141828.577|TR0|American childhood. What do you 
20101224141828.577|20101224141830.239|TR0|mean by that?
20101224141830.239|20101224141831.901|TR0|
20101224141831.901|20101224141833.563|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, the 
20101224141833.563|20101224141835.225|TR0|conditions in which children 
20101224141835.225|20101224141836.887|TR0|develop have been so corrupted 
20101224141836.887|20101224141838.549|TR0|and troubled over the last 
20101224141838.549|20101224141840.211|TR0|several decades that the 
20101224141840.211|20101224141841.873|TR0|template for normal brain 
20101224141841.873|20101224141843.535|TR0|development is no longer present 
20101224141843.535|20101224141845.197|TR0|for many, many kids. And Dr. 
20101224141845.197|20101224141846.859|TR0|Bessel Van der Kolk, who's a 
20101224141846.859|20101224141848.521|TR0|professor of psychiatry at 
20101224141848.521|20101224141850.183|TR0|Boston - University of Boston, 
20101224141850.183|20101224141851.845|TR0|he actually says that the 
20101224141851.845|20101224141853.507|TR0|neglect or abuse of children is 
20101224141853.507|20101224141855.169|TR0|the number one public health 
20101224141855.169|20101224141856.831|TR0|concern in the United States. A 
20101224141856.831|20101224141858.493|TR0|recent study coming out of Notre 
20101224141858.493|20101224141900.154|TR0|Dame by a psychologist there has 
20101224141900.154|20101224141901.816|TR0|shown that the conditions for 
20101224141901.816|20101224141903.478|TR0|child development that 
20101224141903.478|20101224141905.140|TR0|hunter-gatherer societies 
20101224141905.140|20101224141906.802|TR0|provided for their children, 
20101224141906.802|20101224141908.464|TR0|which are the optimal conditions 
20101224141908.464|20101224141910.126|TR0|for development, are no longer 
20101224141910.126|20101224141911.788|TR0|present for our kids. And she 
20101224141911.788|20101224141913.450|TR0|says, actually, that the way we 
20101224141913.450|20101224141915.112|TR0|raise our children today in this 
20101224141915.112|20101224141916.774|TR0|country is increasingly 
20101224141916.774|20101224141918.436|TR0|depriving them of the practices 
20101224141918.436|20101224141920.098|TR0|that lead to well-being in a 
20101224141920.098|20101224141921.760|TR0|moral sense.
20101224141921.760|20101224141923.422|TR0|
20101224141923.422|20101224141925.084|TR0|So what's really going on here 
20101224141925.084|20101224141926.746|TR0|now is that the developmental 
20101224141926.746|20101224141928.408|TR0|conditions for healthy childhood 
20101224141928.408|20101224141930.070|TR0|psychological and brain 
20101224141930.070|20101224141931.732|TR0|development are less and less 
20101224141931.732|20101224141933.393|TR0|available, so that the issue of 
20101224141933.393|20101224141935.055|TR0|ADD is only a small part of the 
20101224141935.055|20101224141936.717|TR0|general issue that children are 
20101224141936.717|20101224141938.379|TR0|no longer having the support for 
20101224141938.379|20101224141940.041|TR0|the way they need to develop.
20101224141940.041|20101224141941.703|TR0|
20101224141941.703|20101224141943.365|TR0|As I made the point in my book 
20101224141943.365|20101224141945.027|TR0|about addiction, as well, the 
20101224141945.027|20101224141946.689|TR0|human brain does not develop on 
20101224141946.689|20101224141948.351|TR0|its own, does not develop 
20101224141948.351|20101224141950.013|TR0|according to a genetic program, 
20101224141950.013|20101224141951.675|TR0|depends very much on the 
20101224141951.675|20101224141953.337|TR0|environment. And the essential 
20101224141953.337|20101224141954.999|TR0|condition for the physiological 
20101224141954.999|20101224141956.661|TR0|development of these brain 
20101224141956.661|20101224141958.323|TR0|circuits that regulate human 
20101224141958.323|20101224141959.985|TR0|behavior, that give us empathy, 
20101224141959.985|20101224142001.647|TR0|that give us a social sense, 
20101224142001.647|20101224142003.309|TR0|that give us a connection with 
20101224142003.309|20101224142004.971|TR0|other people, that give us a 
20101224142004.971|20101224142006.633|TR0|connection with ourselves, that 
20101224142006.633|20101224142008.294|TR0|allows us to mature - the 
20101224142008.294|20101224142009.956|TR0|essential condition for those 
20101224142009.956|20101224142011.618|TR0|circuits, for their 
20101224142011.618|20101224142013.280|TR0|physiological development, is 
20101224142013.280|20101224142014.942|TR0|the presence of emotionally 
20101224142014.942|20101224142016.604|TR0|available, consistently 
20101224142016.604|20101224142018.266|TR0|available, non-stressed, attuned 
20101224142018.266|20101224142019.928|TR0|parenting caregivers.
20101224142019.928|20101224142021.590|TR0|
20101224142021.590|20101224142023.252|TR0|Now, what do you have in a 
20101224142023.252|20101224142024.914|TR0|country where the average 
20101224142024.914|20101224142026.576|TR0|maternity leave is six weeks? 
20101224142026.576|20101224142028.238|TR0|These kids don't have emotional 
20101224142028.238|20101224142029.900|TR0|caregivers available to them. 
20101224142029.900|20101224142031.562|TR0|What do you have in a country 
20101224142031.562|20101224142033.224|TR0|where poor women, nearly 50 
20101224142033.224|20101224142034.886|TR0|percent of them, suffer from 
20101224142034.886|20101224142036.548|TR0|postpartum depression? And when 
20101224142036.548|20101224142038.210|TR0|a woman has postpartum 
20101224142038.210|20101224142039.872|TR0|depression, she can't be attuned 
20101224142039.872|20101224142041.533|TR0|to the child.
20101224142041.533|20101224142043.195|TR0|
20101224142043.195|20101224142044.857|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And what about 
20101224142044.857|20101224142046.519|TR0|fathers?
20101224142046.519|20101224142048.181|TR0|
20101224142048.181|20101224142049.843|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, the 
20101224142049.843|20101224142051.505|TR0|situation with fathers is, is 
20101224142051.505|20101224142053.167|TR0|that increasingly - there was a 
20101224142053.167|20101224142054.829|TR0|study recently that showed an 
20101224142054.829|20101224142056.491|TR0|increasing number of men are 
20101224142056.491|20101224142058.153|TR0|having postpartum depression, as 
20101224142058.153|20101224142059.815|TR0|well. And the main role of the 
20101224142059.815|20101224142101.477|TR0|father, of course, would be to 
20101224142101.477|20101224142103.139|TR0|support the mother. But when 
20101224142103.139|20101224142104.801|TR0|people are - emotionally, 
20101224142104.801|20101224142106.463|TR0|because the cause of postpartum 
20101224142106.463|20101224142108.125|TR0|depression in the mother it is 
20101224142108.125|20101224142109.787|TR0|not intrinsic to the mother - 
20101224142109.787|20101224142111.449|TR0|not intrinsic to the mother.
20101224142111.449|20101224142113.111|TR0|
20101224142113.111|20101224142114.773|TR0|What we have to understand here 
20101224142114.773|20101224142116.434|TR0|is that human beings are not 
20101224142116.434|20101224142118.096|TR0|discrete, individual entities, 
20101224142118.096|20101224142119.758|TR0|contrary to the free enterprise 
20101224142119.758|20101224142121.420|TR0|myth that people are 
20101224142121.420|20101224142123.082|TR0|competitive, individualistic, 
20101224142123.082|20101224142124.744|TR0|private entities. What people 
20101224142124.744|20101224142126.406|TR0|actually are are social 
20101224142126.406|20101224142128.068|TR0|creatures, very much dependent 
20101224142128.068|20101224142129.730|TR0|on one another and very much 
20101224142129.730|20101224142131.392|TR0|programmed to cooperate with one 
20101224142131.392|20101224142133.054|TR0|another when the circumstances 
20101224142133.054|20101224142134.716|TR0|are right. When that's not 
20101224142134.716|20101224142136.378|TR0|available, if the support is not 
20101224142136.378|20101224142138.040|TR0|available for women, that's when 
20101224142138.040|20101224142139.702|TR0|they get depressed. When the 
20101224142139.702|20101224142141.364|TR0|fathers are stressed, they're 
20101224142141.364|20101224142143.026|TR0|not supporting the women in that 
20101224142143.026|20101224142144.688|TR0|really important, crucial 
20101224142144.688|20101224142146.350|TR0|bonding role in the beginning. 
20101224142146.350|20101224142148.012|TR0|In fact, they get stressed and 
20101224142148.012|20101224142149.673|TR0|depressed themselves.

20101224142151.335|20101224142152.997|TR0|The child's brain development 
20101224142152.997|20101224142154.659|TR0|depends on the presence of

20101224142156.321|20101224142157.983|TR0|available parents. In this 
20101224142157.983|20101224142159.645|TR0|country, that's less and less 
20101224142159.645|20101224142201.307|TR0|available. Hence, you've got 
20101224142201.307|20101224142202.969|TR0|burgeoning rates of autism in 
20101224142202.969|20101224142204.631|TR0|this country. It's going up like

20101224142217.927|20101224142219.589|TR0|disorders, but the essential 
20101224142219.589|20101224142221.251|TR0|quality of it is an emotional 
20101224142221.251|20101224142222.912|TR0|disconnect. These children are 
20101224142222.912|20101224142224.574|TR0|living in a mind of their own. 
20101224142224.574|20101224142226.236|TR0|They don't respond appropriately 
20101224142226.236|20101224142227.898|TR0|to emotional cues. They 
20101224142227.898|20101224142229.560|TR0|withdraw. They act out in an 
20101224142229.560|20101224142231.222|TR0|aggressive and sometimes just 
20101224142231.222|20101224142232.884|TR0|unpredictable fashion. They 
20101224142232.884|20101224142234.546|TR0|don't know how to - there's no 
20101224142234.546|20101224142236.208|TR0|sense - there's no clear sense 
20101224142236.208|20101224142237.870|TR0|of a emotional connection and 
20101224142237.870|20101224142239.532|TR0|just peace inside them.
20101224142239.532|20101224142241.194|TR0|
20101224142241.194|20101224142242.856|TR0|And there's many, many more kids 
20101224142242.856|20101224142244.518|TR0|in this country now, 
20101224142244.518|20101224142246.180|TR0|several-fold increase, 20-fold 
20101224142246.180|20101224142247.842|TR0|increase in the last 30 years. 
20101224142247.842|20101224142249.504|TR0|The rates of anxiety amongst 
20101224142249.504|20101224142251.166|TR0|children is increasing. The 
20101224142251.166|20101224142252.828|TR0|numbers of kids on 
20101224142252.828|20101224142254.490|TR0|antidepressant medications has 
20101224142254.490|20101224142256.152|TR0|increased tremendously. The 
20101224142256.152|20101224142257.813|TR0|number of kids being diagnosed 
20101224142257.813|20101224142259.475|TR0|with bipolar disorder has gone 
20101224142259.475|20101224142301.137|TR0|up. And then not to mention all 
20101224142301.137|20101224142302.799|TR0|the behavioral issues, the 
20101224142302.799|20101224142304.461|TR0|bullying that I've already 
20101224142304.461|20101224142306.123|TR0|mentioned, the precocious 
20101224142306.123|20101224142307.785|TR0|sexuality, the teenage 
20101224142307.785|20101224142309.447|TR0|pregnancies. There's now a 
20101224142309.447|20101224142311.109|TR0|program, a so-called "reality 
20101224142311.109|20101224142312.771|TR0|show," that just focuses on 
20101224142312.771|20101224142314.433|TR0|teenage mothers.
20101224142314.433|20101224142316.095|TR0|
20101224142316.095|20101224142317.757|TR0|You know, in other words - see, 
20101224142317.757|20101224142319.419|TR0|it never used to be that 
20101224142319.419|20101224142321.081|TR0|children grew up in a stressed 
20101224142321.081|20101224142322.743|TR0|nuclear family. That wasn't the 
20101224142322.743|20101224142324.405|TR0|normal basis for child 
20101224142324.405|20101224142326.067|TR0|development. The normal basis 
20101224142326.067|20101224142327.729|TR0|for child development has always 
20101224142327.729|20101224142329.391|TR0|been the clan, the tribe, the 
20101224142329.391|20101224142331.052|TR0|community, the neighborhood, the 
20101224142331.052|20101224142332.714|TR0|extended family. Essentially, 
20101224142332.714|20101224142334.376|TR0|post-industrial capitalism has 
20101224142334.376|20101224142336.038|TR0|completely destroyed those 
20101224142336.038|20101224142337.700|TR0|conditions. People no longer 
20101224142337.700|20101224142339.362|TR0|live in communities which are 
20101224142339.362|20101224142341.024|TR0|still connected to one another. 
20101224142341.024|20101224142342.686|TR0|People don't work where they 
20101224142342.686|20101224142344.348|TR0|live. They don't shop where they 
20101224142344.348|20101224142346.010|TR0|live. The kids don't go to 
20101224142346.010|20101224142347.672|TR0|school, necessarily, where they 
20101224142347.672|20101224142349.334|TR0|live. The parents are away most 
20101224142349.334|20101224142350.996|TR0|of the day. For the first time 
20101224142350.996|20101224142352.658|TR0|in history, children are not 
20101224142352.658|20101224142354.320|TR0|spending most of their time 
20101224142354.320|20101224142355.982|TR0|around the nurturing adults in 
20101224142355.982|20101224142357.644|TR0|their lives. And they're 
20101224142357.644|20101224142359.306|TR0|spending their lives away from 
20101224142359.306|20101224142400.968|TR0|the nurturing adults, which is 
20101224142400.968|20101224142402.630|TR0|what they need for healthy brain

20101224142444.178|20101224142445.840|TR0|the drugs, Gabor Mate, affect 
20101224142445.840|20101224142447.502|TR0|the development of the brain.
20101224142447.502|20101224142449.164|TR0|
20101224142449.164|20101224142450.826|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: In ADD, 
20101224142450.826|20101224142452.488|TR0|there's an essential brain 
20101224142452.488|20101224142454.150|TR0|chemical, which is necessary for 
20101224142454.150|20101224142455.812|TR0|incentive and motivation, that 
20101224142455.812|20101224142457.474|TR0|seems to be lacking. That's 
20101224142457.474|20101224142459.136|TR0|called dopamine. And dopamine is 
20101224142459.136|20101224142500.798|TR0|simply an essential life 
20101224142500.798|20101224142502.460|TR0|chemical. Without it, there's no 
20101224142502.460|20101224142504.122|TR0|life. Mice in a laboratory who 
20101224142504.122|20101224142505.784|TR0|have no dopamine will starve 
20101224142505.784|20101224142507.446|TR0|themselves to death, because 
20101224142507.446|20101224142509.108|TR0|they have no incentive to eat. 
20101224142509.108|20101224142510.770|TR0|Even though they're hungry, and 
20101224142510.770|20101224142512.431|TR0|even though their life is in 
20101224142512.431|20101224142514.093|TR0|danger, they will not eat, 
20101224142514.093|20101224142515.755|TR0|because there's no motivation or 
20101224142515.755|20101224142517.417|TR0|incentive. So, partly, one way 
20101224142517.417|20101224142519.079|TR0|to look at ADD is a massive 
20101224142519.079|20101224142520.741|TR0|problem of motivation, because 
20101224142520.741|20101224142522.403|TR0|the dopamine is lacking in the 
20101224142522.403|20101224142524.065|TR0|brain. Now, the stimulant 
20101224142524.065|20101224142525.727|TR0|medications elevate dopamine 
20101224142525.727|20101224142527.389|TR0|levels, and these kids are now 
20101224142527.389|20101224142529.051|TR0|more motivated. They can focus 
20101224142529.051|20101224142530.713|TR0|and pay attention.
20101224142530.713|20101224142532.375|TR0|
20101224142532.375|20101224142534.037|TR0|However, the assumption 
20101224142534.037|20101224142535.699|TR0|underneath giving these kids 
20101224142535.699|20101224142537.361|TR0|medications is that what we're 
20101224142537.361|20101224142539.023|TR0|dealing with here is a genetic 
20101224142539.023|20101224142540.685|TR0|disorder, and the only way to 
20101224142540.685|20101224142542.347|TR0|deal with it is 
20101224142542.347|20101224142544.009|TR0|pharmacologically. And if you 
20101224142544.009|20101224142545.671|TR0|actually look at how the 
20101224142545.671|20101224142547.332|TR0|dopamine levels in a brain 
20101224142547.332|20101224142548.994|TR0|develop, if you look at infant 
20101224142548.994|20101224142550.656|TR0|monkeys and you measure their 
20101224142550.656|20101224142552.318|TR0|dopamine levels, and they're 
20101224142552.318|20101224142553.980|TR0|normal when they're with their 
20101224142553.980|20101224142555.642|TR0|mothers, and when you separate 
20101224142555.642|20101224142557.304|TR0|them from mothers, the dopamine 
20101224142557.304|20101224142558.966|TR0|levels go down within two or 
20101224142558.966|20101224142600.628|TR0|three days.
20101224142600.628|20101224142602.290|TR0|
20101224142602.290|20101224142603.952|TR0|So, in other words, what we're 
20101224142603.952|20101224142605.614|TR0|doing is we're correcting a 
20101224142605.614|20101224142607.276|TR0|massive social problem that has 
20101224142607.276|20101224142608.938|TR0|to do with disconnection in a 
20101224142608.938|20101224142610.600|TR0|society and the loss of 
20101224142610.600|20101224142612.262|TR0|nurturing, non-stressed 
20101224142612.262|20101224142613.924|TR0|parenting, and we're replacing 
20101224142613.924|20101224142615.586|TR0|that chemically. Now, the drugs 
20101224142615.586|20101224142617.248|TR0|- the stimulant drugs do seem to 
20101224142617.248|20101224142618.910|TR0|work, and a lot of kids are 
20101224142618.910|20101224142620.571|TR0|helped by it. The problem is not 
20101224142620.571|20101224142622.233|TR0|so much whether they should be 
20101224142622.233|20101224142623.895|TR0|used or not; the problem is that 
20101224142623.895|20101224142625.557|TR0|80 percent of the time a kid is 
20101224142625.557|20101224142627.219|TR0|prescribed a medication, that's 
20101224142627.219|20101224142628.881|TR0|all that happens. Nobody talks 
20101224142628.881|20101224142630.543|TR0|to the family about the family 
20101224142630.543|20101224142632.205|TR0|environment. The school makes no 
20101224142632.205|20101224142633.867|TR0|attempt to change the school 
20101224142633.867|20101224142635.529|TR0|environment. Nobody connects 
20101224142635.529|20101224142637.191|TR0|with these kids emotionally. In 
20101224142637.191|20101224142638.853|TR0|other words, it's seen simply as

20101224142640.515|20101224142642.177|TR0|problem, but not as a problem of

20101224142645.501|20101224142647.163|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Gabor Mate, you 
20101224142647.163|20101224142648.825|TR0|talk about acting out. What does 
20101224142648.825|20101224142650.487|TR0|acting out mean?
20101224142650.487|20101224142652.149|TR0|
20101224142652.149|20101224142653.811|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, it's a 
20101224142653.811|20101224142655.472|TR0|great question. You see, when we 
20101224142655.472|20101224142657.134|TR0|hear the phrase "acting out," we 
20101224142657.134|20101224142658.796|TR0|usually mean that a kid is 
20101224142658.796|20101224142700.458|TR0|behaving badly, that a child is 
20101224142700.458|20101224142702.120|TR0|being obstreperous, 
20101224142702.120|20101224142703.782|TR0|oppositional, violent, bullying, 
20101224142703.782|20101224142705.444|TR0|rude. That's because we don't 
20101224142705.444|20101224142707.106|TR0|know how to speak English 
20101224142707.106|20101224142708.768|TR0|anymore. The phrase "acting out" 
20101224142708.768|20101224142710.430|TR0|means you're portraying behavior 
20101224142710.430|20101224142712.092|TR0|that which you haven't got the 
20101224142712.092|20101224142713.754|TR0|words to say in language. In a 
20101224142713.754|20101224142715.416|TR0|game of charades, you have to 
20101224142715.416|20101224142717.078|TR0|act out, because you're not 
20101224142717.078|20101224142718.740|TR0|allowed to speak. If you landed 
20101224142718.740|20101224142720.402|TR0|in a country where nobody spoke 
20101224142720.402|20101224142722.064|TR0|your language and you were 
20101224142722.064|20101224142723.726|TR0|hungry, you would have to 
20101224142723.726|20101224142725.388|TR0|literally demonstrate your anger 
20101224142725.388|20101224142727.050|TR0|- sorry, your hunger, through 
20101224142727.050|20101224142728.711|TR0|behavior, pointing to your mouth 
20101224142728.711|20101224142730.373|TR0|or to your empty belly, because 
20101224142730.373|20101224142732.035|TR0|you don't have the words.
20101224142732.035|20101224142733.697|TR0|
20101224142733.697|20101224142735.359|TR0|My point is that, yes, a lot of 
20101224142735.359|20101224142737.021|TR0|children are acting out, but 
20101224142737.021|20101224142738.683|TR0|it's not bad behavior. It's a 
20101224142738.683|20101224142740.345|TR0|representation of emotional 
20101224142740.345|20101224142742.007|TR0|losses and emotional lacks in 
20101224142742.007|20101224142743.669|TR0|their lives. And whether it's, 
20101224142743.669|20101224142745.331|TR0|again, bullying or a whole set 
20101224142745.331|20101224142746.993|TR0|of other behaviors, what we're 
20101224142746.993|20101224142748.655|TR0|dealing with here is childhood 
20101224142748.655|20101224142750.317|TR0|stunted emotional development - 
20101224142750.317|20101224142751.979|TR0|in some cases, stunted pain 
20101224142751.979|20101224142753.641|TR0|development. And rather than 
20101224142753.641|20101224142755.303|TR0|trying to control these 
20101224142755.303|20101224142756.965|TR0|behaviors through punishments, 
20101224142756.965|20101224142758.627|TR0|or even just exclusively through 
20101224142758.627|20101224142800.289|TR0|medications, we need to help 
20101224142800.289|20101224142801.951|TR0|these kids develop.
20101224142801.951|20101224142803.612|TR0|
20101224142803.612|20101224142805.274|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You mentioned 
20101224142805.274|20101224142806.936|TR0|you suffered from ADD, attention 
20101224142806.936|20101224142808.598|TR0|deficit disorder, yourself -

20101224142810.260|20101224142811.922|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Yeah.

20101224142813.584|20101224142815.246|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: - and were 
20101224142815.246|20101224142816.908|TR0|drugged for it. Explain your own 
20101224142816.908|20101224142818.570|TR0|story.
20101224142818.570|20101224142820.232|TR0|
20101224142820.232|20101224142821.894|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, I was 
20101224142821.894|20101224142823.556|TR0|in my early fifties, and I was 
20101224142823.556|20101224142825.218|TR0|working in palliative care at 
20101224142825.218|20101224142826.880|TR0|the time. I was coordinator of a 
20101224142826.880|20101224142828.542|TR0|palliative care unit at a large 
20101224142828.542|20101224142830.204|TR0|Canadian hospital. And a social 
20101224142830.204|20101224142831.866|TR0|worker in the unit, who had just 
20101224142831.866|20101224142833.528|TR0|been diagnosed as an adult, told 
20101224142833.528|20101224142835.190|TR0|me about her story. And as a 
20101224142835.190|20101224142836.851|TR0|physician, I was like most 
20101224142836.851|20101224142838.513|TR0|physicians who know nothing 
20101224142838.513|20101224142840.175|TR0|about ADD. Most physicians 
20101224142840.175|20101224142841.837|TR0|really don't know about the 
20101224142841.837|20101224142843.499|TR0|condition. But when she told me 
20101224142843.499|20101224142845.161|TR0|her story, I realized that was 
20101224142845.161|20101224142846.823|TR0|me. And subsequently, I was 
20101224142846.823|20101224142848.485|TR0|diagnosed. And -
20101224142848.485|20101224142850.147|TR0|
20101224142850.147|20101224142851.809|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And what was 
20101224142851.809|20101224142853.471|TR0|that story? What did you realize 
20101224142853.471|20101224142855.133|TR0|was you?
20101224142855.133|20101224142856.795|TR0|
20101224142856.795|20101224142858.457|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Oh, poor 
20101224142858.457|20101224142900.119|TR0|impulse control a lot of my 
20101224142900.119|20101224142901.781|TR0|life, impulsive behaviors, 
20101224142901.781|20101224142903.443|TR0|disorganization, a tendency to 
20101224142903.443|20101224142905.105|TR0|tune out a lot, be absentminded, 
20101224142905.105|20101224142906.767|TR0|and physical restlessness. I 
20101224142906.767|20101224142908.429|TR0|mean, I had trouble sitting 
20101224142908.429|20101224142910.090|TR0|still. All the traits, you know, 
20101224142910.090|20101224142911.752|TR0|that I saw in the literature on 
20101224142911.752|20101224142913.414|TR0|ADD, I recognized in myself, 
20101224142913.414|20101224142915.076|TR0|which was kind of an epiphany, 
20101224142915.076|20101224142916.738|TR0|in a sense, because you get to 
20101224142916.738|20101224142918.400|TR0|understand - at least you get a 
20101224142918.400|20101224142920.062|TR0|sense of why you're behaving the 
20101224142920.062|20101224142921.724|TR0|way you're behaving.
20101224142921.724|20101224142923.386|TR0|
20101224142923.386|20101224142925.048|TR0|What never made sense to me 
20101224142925.048|20101224142926.710|TR0|right from the beginning, 
20101224142926.710|20101224142928.372|TR0|though, is the idea of ADD as a 
20101224142928.372|20101224142930.034|TR0|genetic disease. And not even 
20101224142930.034|20101224142931.696|TR0|after a couple of my kids were 
20101224142931.696|20101224142933.358|TR0|diagnosed with it, I still 
20101224142933.358|20101224142935.020|TR0|didn't buy the idea that it's 
20101224142935.020|20101224142936.682|TR0|genetic, because it isn't. 
20101224142936.682|20101224142938.344|TR0|Again, it has to do with, in my 
20101224142938.344|20101224142940.006|TR0|case, very stressed 
20101224142940.006|20101224142941.668|TR0|circumstances as an infant, 
20101224142941.668|20101224142943.330|TR0|which I talked about on a 
20101224142943.330|20101224142944.991|TR0|previous program. In the case of 
20101224142944.991|20101224142946.653|TR0|my children, it's because their 
20101224142946.653|20101224142948.315|TR0|father was a workaholic doctor 
20101224142948.315|20101224142949.977|TR0|who wasn't emotionally available 
20101224142949.977|20101224142951.639|TR0|to them. And under those 
20101224142951.639|20101224142953.301|TR0|circumstances, children are 
20101224142953.301|20101224142954.963|TR0|stressed. I mean, if children 
20101224142954.963|20101224142956.625|TR0|are stressed when their brains 
20101224142956.625|20101224142958.287|TR0|are developing, one way to deal 
20101224142958.287|20101224142959.949|TR0|with the stress is to tune out.
20101224142959.949|20101224143001.611|TR0|
20101224143001.611|20101224143003.273|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Talk about 
20101224143003.273|20101224143004.935|TR0|holding on to your kids, why 
20101224143004.935|20101224143006.597|TR0|parents need to matter more than 
20101224143006.597|20101224143008.259|TR0|peers.
20101224143008.259|20101224143009.921|TR0|
20101224143009.921|20101224143011.583|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Amy, in 1998, 
20101224143011.583|20101224143013.245|TR0|there was a book that was on the 
20101224143013.245|20101224143014.907|TR0|New York Times best book of the 
20101224143014.907|20101224143016.569|TR0|year and nearly won the Pulitzer 
20101224143016.569|20101224143018.230|TR0|Prize, and it was called The 
20101224143018.230|20101224143019.892|TR0|Nurture Assumption, in which 
20101224143019.892|20101224143021.554|TR0|this researcher argued that 
20101224143021.554|20101224143023.216|TR0|parents don't make any 
20101224143023.216|20101224143024.878|TR0|difference anymore, because she 
20101224143024.878|20101224143026.540|TR0|looked at the - to the extent 
20101224143026.540|20101224143028.202|TR0|that Newsweek actually had a 
20101224143028.202|20101224143029.864|TR0|cover article that year entitled 
20101224143029.864|20101224143031.526|TR0|"Do Parents Matter?" Now, if you 
20101224143031.526|20101224143033.188|TR0|want to get the full stupidity 
20101224143033.188|20101224143034.850|TR0|of that question, you have to 
20101224143034.850|20101224143036.512|TR0|imagine a veterinarian magazine 
20101224143036.512|20101224143038.174|TR0|asking, "Does the mother cat 
20101224143038.174|20101224143039.836|TR0|make any difference?" or "Does 
20101224143039.836|20101224143041.498|TR0|the mother bear matter?" But the 
20101224143041.498|20101224143043.160|TR0|research showed that children 
20101224143043.160|20101224143044.822|TR0|are being more influenced now, 
20101224143044.822|20101224143046.484|TR0|in their tastes, in their 
20101224143046.484|20101224143048.146|TR0|attitudes, in their behaviors, 
20101224143048.146|20101224143049.808|TR0|by peers than by parents. This 
20101224143049.808|20101224143051.470|TR0|poor researcher concluded that 
20101224143051.470|20101224143053.131|TR0|this is somehow natural. And 
20101224143053.131|20101224143054.793|TR0|what she mistook was that what 
20101224143054.793|20101224143056.455|TR0|is the norm in North America, 
20101224143056.455|20101224143058.117|TR0|she actually thought that was 
20101224143058.117|20101224143059.779|TR0|natural and healthy. In fact, it 
20101224143059.779|20101224143101.441|TR0|isn't.

20101224143104.765|20101224143106.427|TR0|Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter 
20101224143106.427|20101224143108.089|TR0|More than Peers, is about 
20101224143108.089|20101224143109.751|TR0|showing why it is true that 
20101224143109.751|20101224143111.413|TR0|children are being more 
20101224143111.413|20101224143113.075|TR0|influenced by other kids in 
20101224143113.075|20101224143114.737|TR0|these days than by their 
20101224143114.737|20101224143116.399|TR0|parents, but just what an 
20101224143116.399|20101224143118.061|TR0|aberration that is, and what a 
20101224143118.061|20101224143119.723|TR0|distortion it is of normal human 
20101224143119.723|20101224143121.385|TR0|development, because normal 
20101224143121.385|20101224143123.047|TR0|human development demands, as 
20101224143123.047|20101224143124.709|TR0|normal mammalian development 
20101224143124.709|20101224143126.370|TR0|demands, the presence of 
20101224143126.370|20101224143128.032|TR0|nurturing parents. You know, 
20101224143128.032|20101224143129.694|TR0|even birds - birds don't develop 
20101224143129.694|20101224143131.356|TR0|properly unless the mother and 
20101224143131.356|20101224143133.018|TR0|father bird are there. Bears, 
20101224143133.018|20101224143134.680|TR0|cats, rats, mice. Although, most 
20101224143134.680|20101224143136.342|TR0|of all, human beings, because 
20101224143136.342|20101224143138.004|TR0|human beings are the least 
20101224143138.004|20101224143139.666|TR0|mature and the most dependent 
20101224143139.666|20101224143141.328|TR0|for the longest period of time.

20101224143142.990|20101224143144.652|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20101224143144.652|20101224143146.314|TR0|about the importance of 
20101224143146.314|20101224143147.976|TR0|attachment?
20101224143147.976|20101224143149.638|TR0|
20101224143149.638|20101224143151.300|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Attachment is 
20101224143151.300|20101224143152.962|TR0|the drive to be close to 
20101224143152.962|20101224143154.624|TR0|somebody, and attachment is a 
20101224143154.624|20101224143156.286|TR0|power force in human 
20101224143156.286|20101224143157.948|TR0|relationship - in fact, the most 
20101224143157.948|20101224143159.609|TR0|powerful force there is. Even as 
20101224143159.609|20101224143201.271|TR0|adults, when attachment 
20101224143201.271|20101224143202.933|TR0|relationships that people want 
20101224143202.933|20101224143204.595|TR0|to be close to are lost to us or 
20101224143204.595|20101224143206.257|TR0|they're threatened somehow, we 
20101224143206.257|20101224143207.919|TR0|get very disoriented, very 
20101224143207.919|20101224143209.581|TR0|upset. Now, for children and 
20101224143209.581|20101224143211.243|TR0|babies and adolescents, that's 
20101224143211.243|20101224143212.905|TR0|an absolute necessity, because 
20101224143212.905|20101224143214.567|TR0|the more immature you are, the 
20101224143214.567|20101224143216.229|TR0|more you need your attachments. 
20101224143216.229|20101224143217.891|TR0|It's like a force of gravity 
20101224143217.891|20101224143219.553|TR0|that pulls two bodies together. 
20101224143219.553|20101224143221.215|TR0|Now, when the attachment goes in 
20101224143221.215|20101224143222.877|TR0|the wrong direction, instead of 
20101224143222.877|20101224143224.539|TR0|to the adults, but to the peer 
20101224143224.539|20101224143226.201|TR0|group, childhood developments 
20101224143226.201|20101224143227.863|TR0|can be distorted, development is 
20101224143227.863|20101224143229.525|TR0|stopped in its tracks, and 
20101224143229.525|20101224143231.187|TR0|parenting and teaching become 
20101224143231.187|20101224143232.849|TR0|extremely difficult.
20101224143232.849|20101224143234.510|TR0|
20101224143234.510|20101224143236.172|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You co-wrote 
20101224143236.172|20101224143237.834|TR0|this book, and you both found, 
20101224143237.834|20101224143239.496|TR0|in your experience, Hold on to 
20101224143239.496|20101224143241.158|TR0|Your Kids, that your kids were 
20101224143241.158|20101224143242.820|TR0|becoming increasingly secretive 
20101224143242.820|20101224143244.482|TR0|and unreachable.
20101224143244.482|20101224143246.144|TR0|
20101224143246.144|20101224143247.806|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, that's 
20101224143247.806|20101224143249.468|TR0|the thing. You see, now, if your 
20101224143249.468|20101224143251.130|TR0|spouse or partner, adult spouse 
20101224143251.130|20101224143252.792|TR0|or partner, came home from work 
20101224143252.792|20101224143254.454|TR0|and didn't give you the time of 
20101224143254.454|20101224143256.116|TR0|day and got on the phone and 
20101224143256.116|20101224143257.778|TR0|talked with other people all the 
20101224143257.778|20101224143259.440|TR0|time and spent all their time on 
20101224143259.440|20101224143301.102|TR0|email talking to other people, 
20101224143301.102|20101224143302.764|TR0|your friends wouldn't say, 
20101224143302.764|20101224143304.426|TR0|"You've got a behavioral 
20101224143304.426|20101224143306.088|TR0|problem. You should try tough 
20101224143306.088|20101224143307.749|TR0|love." They'd say you've got a 
20101224143307.749|20101224143309.411|TR0|relationship problem. But when 
20101224143309.411|20101224143311.073|TR0|children act in these ways, we 
20101224143311.073|20101224143312.735|TR0|think we have a behavioral 
20101224143312.735|20101224143314.397|TR0|problem, we try and control the 
20101224143314.397|20101224143316.059|TR0|behaviors. In fact, what they're 
20101224143316.059|20101224143317.721|TR0|showing us is that - my children 
20101224143317.721|20101224143319.383|TR0|showed this, as well  --  is 
20101224143319.383|20101224143321.045|TR0|that I had a relationship 
20101224143321.045|20101224143322.707|TR0|problem with them. They weren't 
20101224143322.707|20101224143324.369|TR0|connected enough with me and too 
20101224143324.369|20101224143326.031|TR0|connected to the peer group. So 
20101224143326.031|20101224143327.693|TR0|that's why they wanted to spend 
20101224143327.693|20101224143329.355|TR0|all their time with their peer 
20101224143329.355|20101224143331.017|TR0|group. And now we've given kids 
20101224143331.017|20101224143332.679|TR0|the technology to do that with. 
20101224143332.679|20101224143334.341|TR0|So the terrible downside of the 
20101224143334.341|20101224143336.003|TR0|internet is that now kids are 
20101224143336.003|20101224143337.665|TR0|spending time with each other  --
20101224143337.665|20101224143339.327|TR0|
20101224143339.327|20101224143340.989|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Not even in the 
20101224143340.989|20101224143342.650|TR0|presence of each other.
20101224143342.650|20101224143344.312|TR0|
20101224143344.312|20101224143345.974|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: That's 
20101224143345.974|20101224143347.636|TR0|exactly the point, because, you 
20101224143347.636|20101224143349.298|TR0|see, that's an attachment 
20101224143349.298|20101224143350.960|TR0|dynamic. One of the basic ways 
20101224143350.960|20101224143352.622|TR0|that people attach to each other 
20101224143352.622|20101224143354.284|TR0|is to want to be with the people 
20101224143354.284|20101224143355.946|TR0|that you want to connect with. 
20101224143355.946|20101224143357.608|TR0|So when kids spend time with 
20101224143357.608|20101224143359.270|TR0|each other, it's not a behavior 
20101224143359.270|20101224143400.932|TR0|problem; it's a sign that their 
20101224143400.932|20101224143402.594|TR0|relationships have been skewed 
20101224143402.594|20101224143404.256|TR0|towards the peer group. And 
20101224143404.256|20101224143405.918|TR0|that's why it's so difficult to 
20101224143405.918|20101224143407.580|TR0|peel them off their computers, 
20101224143407.580|20101224143409.242|TR0|because their desperation is to 
20101224143409.242|20101224143410.904|TR0|connect with the people that 
20101224143410.904|20101224143412.566|TR0|they're trying to attach to. And 
20101224143412.566|20101224143414.228|TR0|that's no longer us, as the 
20101224143414.228|20101224143415.889|TR0|adults, as the parents in their 
20101224143415.889|20101224143417.551|TR0|life.
20101224143417.551|20101224143419.213|TR0|
20101224143419.213|20101224143420.875|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: So how do you 
20101224143420.875|20101224143422.537|TR0|change this dynamic?
20101224143422.537|20101224143424.199|TR0|
20101224143424.199|20101224143425.861|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, first 
20101224143425.861|20101224143427.523|TR0|we have to recognize its 
20101224143427.523|20101224143429.185|TR0|manifestations. And so, we have 
20101224143429.185|20101224143430.847|TR0|to recognize that whenever the 
20101224143430.847|20101224143432.509|TR0|child doesn't look adults in the 
20101224143432.509|20101224143434.171|TR0|eye anymore, when the child 
20101224143434.171|20101224143435.833|TR0|wants to be always on the Skype 
20101224143435.833|20101224143437.495|TR0|or the cell phone or twittering 
20101224143437.495|20101224143439.157|TR0|or emailing or MSM messengering, 
20101224143439.157|20101224143440.819|TR0|you recognize it when the child 
20101224143440.819|20101224143442.481|TR0|becomes oppositional to adults. 
20101224143442.481|20101224143444.143|TR0|We tend to think that that's a 
20101224143444.143|20101224143445.805|TR0|normal childhood phenomenon. 
20101224143445.805|20101224143447.467|TR0|It's normal only to a certain 
20101224143447.467|20101224143449.128|TR0|degree.
20101224143449.128|20101224143450.790|TR0|
20101224143450.790|20101224143452.452|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, they have 
20101224143452.452|20101224143454.114|TR0|to rebel in order to separate 
20101224143454.114|20101224143455.776|TR0|later.
20101224143455.776|20101224143457.438|TR0|
20101224143457.438|20101224143459.100|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: No. They have 
20101224143459.100|20101224143500.762|TR0|to separate, but they don't have 
20101224143500.762|20101224143502.424|TR0|to rebel. In other words, 
20101224143502.424|20101224143504.086|TR0|separation is a normal human - 
20101224143504.086|20101224143505.748|TR0|individuation is a normal human 
20101224143505.748|20101224143507.410|TR0|developmental stage. You have to 
20101224143507.410|20101224143509.072|TR0|become a separate, individual 
20101224143509.072|20101224143510.734|TR0|person. But it doesn't mean you 
20101224143510.734|20101224143512.396|TR0|have to reject and be hostile to 
20101224143512.396|20101224143514.058|TR0|the values of the adults. As a 
20101224143514.058|20101224143515.720|TR0|matter of fact, in traditional 
20101224143515.720|20101224143517.382|TR0|societies, children would become 
20101224143517.382|20101224143519.044|TR0|adults by being initiated into 
20101224143519.044|20101224143520.706|TR0|the adult group by elders, like 
20101224143520.706|20101224143522.368|TR0|the Jewish Bar Mitzvah ceremony 
20101224143522.368|20101224143524.029|TR0|or the initiation rituals of 
20101224143524.029|20101224143525.691|TR0|tribal cultures around the 
20101224143525.691|20101224143527.353|TR0|world. Now kids are initiated by 
20101224143527.353|20101224143529.015|TR0|other kids. And now you have the 
20101224143529.015|20101224143530.677|TR0|gang phenomenon, so that the 
20101224143530.677|20101224143532.339|TR0|teenage gang phenomenon is 
20101224143532.339|20101224143534.001|TR0|actually a misplaced initiation 
20101224143534.001|20101224143535.663|TR0|and orientation ritual, where 
20101224143535.663|20101224143537.325|TR0|kids are now rebelling against 
20101224143537.325|20101224143538.987|TR0|adult values. But it's not 
20101224143538.987|20101224143540.649|TR0|because they're bad kids, but 
20101224143540.649|20101224143542.311|TR0|because they've become 
20101224143542.311|20101224143543.973|TR0|disconnected from adults.

20101224143545.635|20101224143547.297|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Mate, 
20101224143547.297|20101224143548.959|TR0|there's a whole debate about 
20101224143548.959|20101224143550.621|TR0|education in the United States 
20101224143550.621|20101224143552.283|TR0|right now. How does this fit in?
20101224143552.283|20101224143553.945|TR0|
20101224143553.945|20101224143555.607|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, you 
20101224143555.607|20101224143557.268|TR0|have to ask, how do children 
20101224143557.268|20101224143558.930|TR0|learn? How do children learn? 
20101224143558.930|20101224143600.592|TR0|And learning is an attachment 
20101224143600.592|20101224143602.254|TR0|dynamic, as well. You learn when 
20101224143602.254|20101224143603.916|TR0|you want to be like somebody. So 
20101224143603.916|20101224143605.578|TR0|you copy them, so you learn from 
20101224143605.578|20101224143607.240|TR0|them. You learn when you're 
20101224143607.240|20101224143608.902|TR0|curious. And you learn when 
20101224143608.902|20101224143610.564|TR0|you're willing to try something, 
20101224143610.564|20101224143612.226|TR0|and if it doesn't work, you try 
20101224143612.226|20101224143613.888|TR0|something else.
20101224143613.888|20101224143615.550|TR0|
20101224143615.550|20101224143617.212|TR0|Now, here's what happens. Caring 
20101224143617.212|20101224143618.874|TR0|about something and being 
20101224143618.874|20101224143620.536|TR0|curious about something and 
20101224143620.536|20101224143622.198|TR0|recognizing that something 
20101224143622.198|20101224143623.860|TR0|doesn't work, you have to have a 
20101224143623.860|20101224143625.522|TR0|certain degree of emotional 
20101224143625.522|20101224143627.184|TR0|security. You have to be able to 
20101224143627.184|20101224143628.846|TR0|be open and vulnerable. Children 
20101224143628.846|20101224143630.508|TR0|who become peer-oriented - 
20101224143630.508|20101224143632.169|TR0|because the peer world is so 
20101224143632.169|20101224143633.831|TR0|dangerous and so fraught with 
20101224143633.831|20101224143635.493|TR0|bullying and ostracization and 
20101224143635.493|20101224143637.155|TR0|dissing and exclusion and 
20101224143637.155|20101224143638.817|TR0|negative talk, how does a child 
20101224143638.817|20101224143640.479|TR0|protect himself or herself from 
20101224143640.479|20101224143642.141|TR0|all that negativity in the peer 
20101224143642.141|20101224143643.803|TR0|world? Because children are not 
20101224143643.803|20101224143645.465|TR0|committed to each others' 
20101224143645.465|20101224143647.127|TR0|unconditional loving acceptance. 
20101224143647.127|20101224143648.789|TR0|Even adults have a hard time 
20101224143648.789|20101224143650.451|TR0|giving that. Children can't do 
20101224143650.451|20101224143652.113|TR0|it. Those children become very 
20101224143652.113|20101224143653.775|TR0|insecure, and emotionally, to 
20101224143653.775|20101224143655.437|TR0|protect themselves, they shut 
20101224143655.437|20101224143657.099|TR0|down. They become hardened, so 
20101224143657.099|20101224143658.761|TR0|they become cool. Nothing 
20101224143658.761|20101224143700.423|TR0|matters. Cool is the ethic. You 
20101224143700.423|20101224143702.085|TR0|see that in the rock videos. 
20101224143702.085|20101224143703.747|TR0|It's all about cool. It's all 
20101224143703.747|20101224143705.408|TR0|about aggression and cool and no 
20101224143705.408|20101224143707.070|TR0|real emotion. Now, when that 
20101224143707.070|20101224143708.732|TR0|happens, curiosity goes, because 
20101224143708.732|20101224143710.394|TR0|curiosity is vulnerable, because 
20101224143710.394|20101224143712.056|TR0|you care about something and 
20101224143712.056|20101224143713.718|TR0|you're admitting that you don't 
20101224143713.718|20101224143715.380|TR0|know. You won't try anything, 
20101224143715.380|20101224143717.042|TR0|because if you fail, again, your 
20101224143717.042|20101224143718.704|TR0|vulnerability is exposed. So, 
20101224143718.704|20101224143720.366|TR0|you're not willing to have trial 
20101224143720.366|20101224143722.028|TR0|and error.
20101224143722.028|20101224143723.690|TR0|
20101224143723.690|20101224143725.352|TR0|And in terms of who you're 
20101224143725.352|20101224143727.014|TR0|learning from, as long as kids 
20101224143727.014|20101224143728.676|TR0|were attaching to adults, they 
20101224143728.676|20101224143730.338|TR0|were looking to the adults to be 
20101224143730.338|20101224143732.000|TR0|modeling themselves on, to learn 
20101224143732.000|20101224143733.662|TR0|from, and to get their cues 
20101224143733.662|20101224143735.324|TR0|from. Now, kids are still 
20101224143735.324|20101224143736.986|TR0|learning from the people they're 
20101224143736.986|20101224143738.647|TR0|attached to, but now it's other 
20101224143738.647|20101224143740.309|TR0|kids. So you have whole 
20101224143740.309|20101224143741.971|TR0|generations of kids that are 
20101224143741.971|20101224143743.633|TR0|looking to other kids now to be 
20101224143743.633|20101224143745.295|TR0|their main cue-givers. So 
20101224143745.295|20101224143746.957|TR0|teachers have an almost 
20101224143746.957|20101224143748.619|TR0|impossible problem on their 
20101224143748.619|20101224143750.281|TR0|hands. And unfortunately, in 
20101224143750.281|20101224143751.943|TR0|North America again, education 
20101224143751.943|20101224143753.605|TR0|is seen as a question of 
20101224143753.605|20101224143755.267|TR0|academic pedagogy, hence these 
20101224143755.267|20101224143756.929|TR0|terrible standardized tests. And 
20101224143756.929|20101224143758.591|TR0|the very teachers who work with 
20101224143758.591|20101224143800.253|TR0|the most difficult kids are the 
20101224143800.253|20101224143801.915|TR0|ones who are most penalized.
20101224143801.915|20101224143803.577|TR0|
20101224143803.577|20101224143805.239|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Because if they 
20101224143805.239|20101224143806.901|TR0|don't have good test scores, 
20101224143806.901|20101224143808.563|TR0|standardized test scores, in 
20101224143808.563|20101224143810.225|TR0|their class -
20101224143810.225|20101224143811.887|TR0|
20101224143811.887|20101224143813.548|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: They're seen 
20101224143813.548|20101224143815.210|TR0|as bad teachers.
20101224143815.210|20101224143816.872|TR0|
20101224143816.872|20101224143818.534|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: - then they 
20101224143818.534|20101224143820.196|TR0|could be fired. They're seen as 
20101224143820.196|20101224143821.858|TR0|bad teachers, which means 
20101224143821.858|20101224143823.520|TR0|they're going to want to kick 
20101224143823.520|20101224143825.182|TR0|out any difficult kids.
20101224143825.182|20101224143826.844|TR0|
20101224143826.844|20101224143828.506|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: That's 
20101224143828.506|20101224143830.168|TR0|exactly it. The difficult kids 
20101224143830.168|20101224143831.830|TR0|are kicked out, and teachers 
20101224143831.830|20101224143833.492|TR0|will be afraid to go into 
20101224143833.492|20101224143835.154|TR0|neighborhoods where, because of 
20101224143835.154|20101224143836.816|TR0|troubled family relationships, 
20101224143836.816|20101224143838.478|TR0|the kids are having 
20101224143838.478|20101224143840.140|TR0|difficulties, the kids are 
20101224143840.140|20101224143841.802|TR0|peer-oriented, the kids are not 
20101224143841.802|20101224143843.464|TR0|looking to the teachers. And 
20101224143843.464|20101224143845.126|TR0|this is seen as a reflection. 
20101224143845.126|20101224143846.787|TR0|So, actually, teachers are being 
20101224143846.787|20101224143848.449|TR0|slandered right now. Teachers 
20101224143848.449|20101224143850.111|TR0|are being slandered now because 
20101224143850.111|20101224143851.773|TR0|of the failure of the American 
20101224143851.773|20101224143853.435|TR0|society to produce the right 
20101224143853.435|20101224143855.097|TR0|environment for childhood

20101224143905.069|20101224143906.731|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: That's right. 
20101224143906.731|20101224143908.393|TR0|What the problem reflects is the 
20101224143908.393|20101224143910.055|TR0|loss of the community and the 
20101224143910.055|20101224143911.717|TR0|neighborhood. We have to 
20101224143911.717|20101224143913.379|TR0|recreate that. So, the schools 
20101224143913.379|20101224143915.041|TR0|have to become not just places 
20101224143915.041|20101224143916.703|TR0|of pedagogy, but places of 
20101224143916.703|20101224143918.365|TR0|emotional connection. The 
20101224143918.365|20101224143920.027|TR0|teachers should be in the 
20101224143920.027|20101224143921.688|TR0|emotional connection game before

20101224143951.604|20101224143953.266|TR0|special with Dr. Gabor Mate, 
20101224143953.266|20101224143954.927|TR0|Canadian physician and writer. 
20101224143954.927|20101224143956.589|TR0|Dr. Mate came on Democracy Now! 
20101224143956.589|20101224143958.251|TR0|this year to discuss his book 
20101224143958.251|20101224143959.913|TR0|When the Body Says No: 
20101224143959.913|20101224144001.575|TR0|Understanding the Stress-Disease 
20101224144001.575|20101224144003.237|TR0|Connection. Based on medical 
20101224144003.237|20101224144004.899|TR0|studies and his own experience 
20101224144004.899|20101224144006.561|TR0|with chronically ill patients at 
20101224144006.561|20101224144008.223|TR0|the Palliative Care Unit at 
20101224144008.223|20101224144009.885|TR0|Vancouver Hospital, where he was 
20101224144009.885|20101224144011.547|TR0|the medical coordinator for 
20101224144011.547|20101224144013.209|TR0|seven years, Dr. Mate argues 
20101224144013.209|20101224144014.871|TR0|that stress and individual 
20101224144014.871|20101224144016.533|TR0|emotional makeup play critical 
20101224144016.533|20101224144018.195|TR0|roles in an array of diseases, 
20101224144018.195|20101224144019.857|TR0|including cancer, heart disease, 
20101224144019.857|20101224144021.519|TR0|diabetes, multiple sclerosis and 
20101224144021.519|20101224144023.181|TR0|arthritis. Speaking to us this 
20101224144023.181|20101224144024.843|TR0|time from Vancouver - it was 
20101224144024.843|20101224144026.505|TR0|actually during the Vancouver 
20101224144026.505|20101224144028.166|TR0|Olympics - Dr. Mate began by 
20101224144028.166|20101224144029.828|TR0|explaining his analysis of the 
20101224144029.828|20101224144031.490|TR0|mind-body connection.
20101224144031.490|20101224144033.152|TR0|
20101224144033.152|20101224144034.814|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: You know, the 
20101224144034.814|20101224144036.476|TR0|traditional medicines of China 
20101224144036.476|20101224144038.138|TR0|for 3,000 years, the ayurvedic 
20101224144038.138|20101224144039.800|TR0|medicine of India, and the 
20101224144039.800|20101224144041.462|TR0|tribal shamanic medicines of all 
20101224144041.462|20101224144043.124|TR0|cultures around the world have 
20101224144043.124|20101224144044.786|TR0|always taken for granted that 
20101224144044.786|20101224144046.448|TR0|mind and body can't be 
20101224144046.448|20101224144048.110|TR0|separated. Now, Western medicine 
20101224144048.110|20101224144049.772|TR0|has cleaved the two apart for, 
20101224144049.772|20101224144051.434|TR0|really, 2,000 years. Socrates 
20101224144051.434|20101224144053.096|TR0|already criticized the doctors 
20101224144053.096|20101224144054.758|TR0|of his day for separating the 
20101224144054.758|20101224144056.420|TR0|mind from the body. And the 
20101224144056.420|20101224144058.082|TR0|irony - in fact, the tragedy - 
20101224144058.082|20101224144059.744|TR0|is that now we have the Western 
20101224144059.744|20101224144101.406|TR0|science that shows, 
20101224144101.406|20101224144103.067|TR0|incontrovertibly and in great 
20101224144103.067|20101224144104.729|TR0|detail, that mind and body can't 
20101224144104.729|20101224144106.391|TR0|be separated, and so that any 
20101224144106.391|20101224144108.053|TR0|attempt to do so leaves the 
20101224144108.053|20101224144109.715|TR0|medical practitioner short of 
20101224144109.715|20101224144111.377|TR0|many tools to help clients. And, 
20101224144111.377|20101224144113.039|TR0|of course, it leaves patients 
20101224144113.039|20101224144114.701|TR0|short of what they need for 
20101224144114.701|20101224144116.363|TR0|their own healing.
20101224144116.363|20101224144118.025|TR0|
20101224144118.025|20101224144119.687|TR0|The point now is that the 
20101224144119.687|20101224144121.349|TR0|emotional centers of the brain, 
20101224144121.349|20101224144123.011|TR0|which regulate our behaviors and 
20101224144123.011|20101224144124.673|TR0|our responses and our reactions, 
20101224144124.673|20101224144126.335|TR0|are physiologically connected 
20101224144126.335|20101224144127.997|TR0|with - and we know exactly how 
20101224144127.997|20101224144129.659|TR0|they're connected - with the 
20101224144129.659|20101224144131.321|TR0|immune system, the nervous 
20101224144131.321|20101224144132.983|TR0|system and the hormonal 
20101224144132.983|20101224144134.645|TR0|apparatus. In fact, it's no 
20101224144134.645|20101224144136.306|TR0|longer possible, scientifically, 
20101224144136.306|20101224144137.968|TR0|to speak of these as separate 
20101224144137.968|20101224144139.630|TR0|systems, as if immunity was 
20101224144139.630|20101224144141.292|TR0|separate from emotions, as if 
20101224144141.292|20101224144142.954|TR0|the nervous system was separate 
20101224144142.954|20101224144144.616|TR0|from the hormonal apparatus. 
20101224144144.616|20101224144146.278|TR0|There's one system, and they're 
20101224144146.278|20101224144147.940|TR0|wired together by the nervous 
20101224144147.940|20101224144149.602|TR0|system itself and joined 
20101224144149.602|20101224144151.264|TR0|together by chemical messengers 
20101224144151.264|20101224144152.926|TR0|that they all secrete, and so 
20101224144152.926|20101224144154.588|TR0|that whatever happens 
20101224144154.588|20101224144156.250|TR0|emotionally has an impact 
20101224144156.250|20101224144157.912|TR0|immunologically, and vice versa. 
20101224144157.912|20101224144159.574|TR0|So, for example, we know now 
20101224144159.574|20101224144201.236|TR0|that the white cells in the 
20101224144201.236|20101224144202.898|TR0|circulation of our - of the 
20101224144202.898|20101224144204.560|TR0|blood can manufacture every 
20101224144204.560|20101224144206.222|TR0|hormone that the brain can 
20101224144206.222|20101224144207.884|TR0|manufacture, and vice versa, so 
20101224144207.884|20101224144209.546|TR0|that the brain and the immune 
20101224144209.546|20101224144211.207|TR0|system are always talking to one 
20101224144211.207|20101224144212.869|TR0|another.
20101224144212.869|20101224144214.531|TR0|
20101224144214.531|20101224144216.193|TR0|So, in short, we have one 
20101224144216.193|20101224144217.855|TR0|system. The science that studies 
20101224144217.855|20101224144219.517|TR0|it is called 
20101224144219.517|20101224144221.179|TR0|psychoneuroimmunology. And 
20101224144221.179|20101224144222.841|TR0|scientifically, it's not even 
20101224144222.841|20101224144224.503|TR0|controversial, but it's 
20101224144224.503|20101224144226.165|TR0|completely lacking from medical 
20101224144226.165|20101224144227.827|TR0|practice.
20101224144227.827|20101224144229.489|TR0|
20101224144229.489|20101224144231.151|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: What do you 
20101224144231.151|20101224144232.813|TR0|mean, Dr. Mate, by the mind-body 
20101224144232.813|20101224144234.475|TR0|- by the Bermuda Triangle?
20101224144234.475|20101224144236.137|TR0|
20101224144236.137|20101224144237.799|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, the 
20101224144237.799|20101224144239.461|TR0|Bermuda Triangle is that the 
20101224144239.461|20101224144241.123|TR0|research is done. For example, 
20101224144241.123|20101224144242.785|TR0|let me give you a couple of 
20101224144242.785|20101224144244.446|TR0|examples. Three years ago or 
20101224144244.446|20101224144246.108|TR0|four years ago, a study 
20101224144246.108|20101224144247.770|TR0|presented at the Heart and 
20101224144247.770|20101224144249.432|TR0|Stroke Foundation's 
20101224144249.432|20101224144251.094|TR0|International Congress on 
20101224144251.094|20101224144252.756|TR0|Women's Health, a study that was 
20101224144252.756|20101224144254.418|TR0|written up in the online version 
20101224144254.418|20101224144256.080|TR0|of a major North American 
20101224144256.080|20101224144257.742|TR0|medical journal called 
20101224144257.742|20101224144259.404|TR0|Circulation, showed that women - 
20101224144259.404|20101224144301.066|TR0|over a 10-year period, they 
20101224144301.066|20101224144302.728|TR0|followed 1,700 women - over a 
20101224144302.728|20101224144304.390|TR0|10-year period, women who were 
20101224144304.390|20101224144306.052|TR0|unhappily married and didn't 
20101224144306.052|20101224144307.714|TR0|express their emotions were four 
20101224144307.714|20101224144309.376|TR0|times as likely to die as those 
20101224144309.376|20101224144311.038|TR0|women who were unhappily married 
20101224144311.038|20101224144312.700|TR0|and did express their feelings. 
20101224144312.700|20101224144314.362|TR0|In other words, the 
20101224144314.362|20101224144316.024|TR0|non-expression of emotion was 
20101224144316.024|20101224144317.686|TR0|associated with a 400 percent 
20101224144317.686|20101224144319.347|TR0|increase in the death rate. And 
20101224144319.347|20101224144321.009|TR0|this study was done in the 
20101224144321.009|20101224144322.671|TR0|States, part of a major 
20101224144322.671|20101224144324.333|TR0|population study.
20101224144324.333|20101224144325.995|TR0|
20101224144325.995|20101224144327.657|TR0|Now, you would think that study 
20101224144327.657|20101224144329.319|TR0|would send every physician in 
20101224144329.319|20101224144330.981|TR0|North America trying to figure 
20101224144330.981|20101224144332.643|TR0|out the mind-body connection. 
20101224144332.643|20101224144334.305|TR0|But these studies get published, 
20101224144334.305|20101224144335.967|TR0|and they sink without a trace. 
20101224144335.967|20101224144337.629|TR0|There was a study two years ago 
20101224144337.629|20101224144339.291|TR0|that showed that children of 
20101224144339.291|20101224144340.953|TR0|mothers who are stressed and 
20101224144340.953|20101224144342.615|TR0|depressed are themselves, the 
20101224144342.615|20101224144344.277|TR0|children, are more likely to 
20101224144344.277|20101224144345.939|TR0|have asthma. Again, the 
20101224144345.939|20101224144347.601|TR0|mind-body connection. You'd 
20101224144347.601|20101224144349.263|TR0|think that study alone would 
20101224144349.263|20101224144350.925|TR0|send every physician running to 
20101224144350.925|20101224144352.586|TR0|figure out the mind-body 
20101224144352.586|20101224144354.248|TR0|connection. But again, these 
20101224144354.248|20101224144355.910|TR0|studies are done; they disappear 
20101224144355.910|20101224144357.572|TR0|without a trace, and they have 
20101224144357.572|20101224144359.234|TR0|no impact on medical practice. 
20101224144359.234|20101224144400.896|TR0|And that's what I mean by the 
20101224144400.896|20101224144402.558|TR0|Bermuda Triangle, is that we 
20101224144402.558|20101224144404.220|TR0|have the research; we just don't 
20101224144404.220|20101224144405.882|TR0|pay attention to it, as like if 
20101224144405.882|20101224144407.544|TR0|it never happened.
20101224144407.544|20101224144409.206|TR0|
20101224144409.206|20101224144410.868|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You talk about 
20101224144410.868|20101224144412.530|TR0|emotions like anger sharing with 
20101224144412.530|20101224144414.192|TR0|our immune system the same role 
20101224144414.192|20101224144415.854|TR0|of defending our boundaries, 
20101224144415.854|20101224144417.516|TR0|saying when we repress emotions, 
20101224144417.516|20101224144419.178|TR0|we may also repress our immune 
20101224144419.178|20101224144420.840|TR0|defenses. How does that play out 
20101224144420.840|20101224144422.502|TR0|in various diseases?
20101224144422.502|20101224144424.164|TR0|
20101224144424.164|20101224144425.825|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, when I 
20101224144425.825|20101224144427.487|TR0|looked at the kind of people 
20101224144427.487|20101224144429.149|TR0|that would be coming under my 
20101224144429.149|20101224144430.811|TR0|care in palliative care, but 
20101224144430.811|20101224144432.473|TR0|also the kind of people who 
20101224144432.473|20101224144434.135|TR0|would get sick when I was in 
20101224144434.135|20101224144435.797|TR0|family practice, a number of 
20101224144435.797|20101224144437.459|TR0|salient characteristics 
20101224144437.459|20101224144439.121|TR0|presented themselves. One was 
20101224144439.121|20101224144440.783|TR0|the repression of anger. People 
20101224144440.783|20101224144442.445|TR0|didn't know how to express 
20101224144442.445|20101224144444.107|TR0|negative emotion. They were 
20101224144444.107|20101224144445.769|TR0|afraid to do so or did not know 
20101224144445.769|20101224144447.431|TR0|when they were angry. People who 
20101224144447.431|20101224144449.093|TR0|were pleasers, they tried to 
20101224144449.093|20101224144450.755|TR0|always not to disappoint other 
20101224144450.755|20101224144452.417|TR0|people. They never knew how to 
20101224144452.417|20101224144454.079|TR0|say no. They took on everything 
20101224144454.079|20101224144455.741|TR0|without a murmur, because they 
20101224144455.741|20101224144457.403|TR0|saw their role as always being 
20101224144457.403|20101224144459.065|TR0|the caregivers and the 
20101224144459.065|20101224144500.726|TR0|caretakers. And they had an 
20101224144500.726|20101224144502.388|TR0|exceedingly powerful sense of 
20101224144502.388|20101224144504.050|TR0|duty, role and responsibility.
20101224144504.050|20101224144505.712|TR0|
20101224144505.712|20101224144507.374|TR0|Now, if you look at the role of 
20101224144507.374|20101224144509.036|TR0|healthy assertion of boundaries 
20101224144509.036|20101224144510.698|TR0|and anger, for example, it's 
20101224144510.698|20101224144512.360|TR0|actually there to protect you. 
20101224144512.360|20101224144514.022|TR0|I'm talking about healthy anger. 
20101224144514.022|20101224144515.684|TR0|It's not there to attack 
20101224144515.684|20101224144517.346|TR0|anybody; it's just there to 
20101224144517.346|20101224144519.008|TR0|protect your boundaries. That's 
20101224144519.008|20101224144520.670|TR0|the same role as the immune 
20101224144520.670|20101224144522.332|TR0|system have. The immune system 
20101224144522.332|20101224144523.994|TR0|also functions like a brain. It 
20101224144523.994|20101224144525.656|TR0|has memory, it has reactive 
20101224144525.656|20101224144527.318|TR0|capacity, and it has learning 
20101224144527.318|20101224144528.980|TR0|capacity. In fact, the immune 
20101224144528.980|20101224144530.642|TR0|system has been called the 
20101224144530.642|20101224144532.304|TR0|"floating brain." And it's in 
20101224144532.304|20101224144533.965|TR0|interaction with the brain up in 
20101224144533.965|20101224144535.627|TR0|our heads.
20101224144535.627|20101224144537.289|TR0|
20101224144537.289|20101224144538.951|TR0|Now, women, for example, with 
20101224144538.951|20101224144540.613|TR0|breast cancer, who don't know 
20101224144540.613|20101224144542.275|TR0|how to express anger, they've 
20101224144542.275|20101224144543.937|TR0|been shown to have diminished 
20101224144543.937|20101224144545.599|TR0|activity of a group of immune 
20101224144545.599|20101224144547.261|TR0|cells called natural killer 
20101224144547.261|20101224144548.923|TR0|cells. Natural killer cells 
20101224144548.923|20101224144550.585|TR0|attack foreign bacteria, virus 
20101224144550.585|20101224144552.247|TR0|and also malignant cells. have 
20101224144552.247|20101224144553.909|TR0|been able to increase the 
20101224144553.909|20101224144555.571|TR0|natural killer cells. In other 
20101224144555.571|20101224144557.233|TR0|words, they protect our 
20101224144557.233|20101224144558.895|TR0|boundaries. Women who don't know 
20101224144558.895|20101224144600.557|TR0|how to express their boundaries 
20101224144600.557|20101224144602.219|TR0|emotionally, they suppress their 
20101224144602.219|20101224144603.881|TR0|boundaries immunologically, and 
20101224144603.881|20101224144605.543|TR0|therefore they're more likely to 
20101224144605.543|20101224144607.205|TR0|develop disease. The same is 
20101224144607.205|20101224144608.866|TR0|true, of course, of men, so that 
20101224144608.866|20101224144610.528|TR0|the immune system is in constant 
20101224144610.528|20101224144612.190|TR0|interaction with our emotional 
20101224144612.190|20101224144613.852|TR0|responses.
20101224144613.852|20101224144615.514|TR0|
20101224144615.514|20101224144617.176|TR0|In another study with the immune 
20101224144617.176|20101224144618.838|TR0|system, medical students under 
20101224144618.838|20101224144620.500|TR0|the stress of examination were 
20101224144620.500|20101224144622.162|TR0|found to have diminished 
20101224144622.162|20101224144623.824|TR0|activity of their natural killer 
20101224144623.824|20101224144625.486|TR0|cells, these immune cells. But 
20101224144625.486|20101224144627.148|TR0|those students who were 
20101224144627.148|20101224144628.810|TR0|emotionally isolated were most 
20101224144628.810|20101224144630.472|TR0|likely to have diminished 
20101224144630.472|20101224144632.134|TR0|activity of their immune system. 
20101224144632.134|20101224144633.796|TR0|In other words, another fact 
20101224144633.796|20101224144635.458|TR0|that's important is our 
20101224144635.458|20101224144637.120|TR0|relationship with other people. 
20101224144637.120|20101224144638.782|TR0|And the Los Angeles UCLA 
20101224144638.782|20101224144640.444|TR0|psychiatrist, Dr. Daniel Siegel, 
20101224144640.444|20101224144642.105|TR0|has coined a phrase 
20101224144642.105|20101224144643.767|TR0|"interpersonal neurobiology," to 
20101224144643.767|20101224144645.429|TR0|indicate that our biology of our 
20101224144645.429|20101224144647.091|TR0|brains, but indeed of our whole 
20101224144647.091|20101224144648.753|TR0|bodies, is in interaction with 
20101224144648.753|20101224144650.415|TR0|our personal relationships. So 
20101224144650.415|20101224144652.077|TR0|how we express ourselves in 
20101224144652.077|20101224144653.739|TR0|those relationships, or how we 
20101224144653.739|20101224144655.401|TR0|suppress ourselves, has a lot to 
20101224144655.401|20101224144657.063|TR0|do with our health.
20101224144657.063|20101224144658.725|TR0|
20101224144658.725|20101224144700.387|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You talk 
20101224144700.387|20101224144702.049|TR0|particularly about autoimmune 
20101224144702.049|20101224144703.711|TR0|diseases and their connection - 
20101224144703.711|20101224144705.373|TR0|well, that mind-body connection, 
20101224144705.373|20101224144707.035|TR0|like, for example, rheumatoid 
20101224144707.035|20101224144708.697|TR0|arthritis.
20101224144708.697|20101224144710.359|TR0|
20101224144710.359|20101224144712.021|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: A case 
20101224144712.021|20101224144713.683|TR0|example I give in the book is a 
20101224144713.683|20101224144715.344|TR0|young woman who was preparing 
20101224144715.344|20101224144717.006|TR0|Rosh Hashanah dinner one night 
20101224144717.006|20101224144718.668|TR0|for the family, Rosh Hashanah 
20101224144718.668|20101224144720.330|TR0|being the Jewish new year that 
20101224144720.330|20101224144721.992|TR0|falls in September. I called her 
20101224144721.992|20101224144723.654|TR0|"Rachel" in the book. And she 
20101224144723.654|20101224144725.316|TR0|was working very hard. She was 
20101224144725.316|20101224144726.978|TR0|at her mother's place cooking 
20101224144726.978|20101224144728.640|TR0|dinner, and she was in a real 
20101224144728.640|20101224144730.302|TR0|hurry, because she had to finish 
20101224144730.302|20101224144731.964|TR0|by 5:00, when her brother was 
20101224144731.964|20101224144733.626|TR0|going to arrive with his family, 
20101224144733.626|20101224144735.288|TR0|and he didn't like her. He 
20101224144735.288|20101224144736.950|TR0|didn't want to be at the dinner. 
20101224144736.950|20101224144738.612|TR0|So she had to finish the dinner 
20101224144738.612|20101224144740.274|TR0|and leave before he arrived. And 
20101224144740.274|20101224144741.936|TR0|I asked her, "Are you serious? 
20101224144741.936|20101224144743.598|TR0|You're making dinner for a 
20101224144743.598|20101224144745.260|TR0|family that you're not going to 
20101224144745.260|20101224144746.922|TR0|take part in yourself? Why?" And 
20101224144746.922|20101224144748.584|TR0|she said, "Well, because the 
20101224144748.584|20101224144750.245|TR0|family should be together for 
20101224144750.245|20101224144751.907|TR0|Rosh Hashanah, shouldn't they?"
20101224144751.907|20101224144753.569|TR0|
20101224144753.569|20101224144755.231|TR0|Well, she never finished the 
20101224144755.231|20101224144756.893|TR0|meal. Her body said no. She came 
20101224144756.893|20101224144758.555|TR0|down with severe inflammation in 
20101224144758.555|20101224144800.217|TR0|all her joints, and she was 
20101224144800.217|20101224144801.879|TR0|rushed to the hospital with her 
20101224144801.879|20101224144803.541|TR0|first malignant outbreak of 
20101224144803.541|20101224144805.203|TR0|rheumatoid arthritis. And that 
20101224144805.203|20101224144806.865|TR0|self-suppression is typical for 
20101224144806.865|20101224144808.527|TR0|people that develop rheumatoid 
20101224144808.527|20101224144810.189|TR0|arthritis.
20101224144810.189|20101224144811.851|TR0|
20101224144811.851|20101224144813.513|TR0|It's also typical for people 
20101224144813.513|20101224144815.175|TR0|that develop ALS, amyotrophic 
20101224144815.175|20101224144816.837|TR0|lateral sclerosis. I talk about 
20101224144816.837|20101224144818.499|TR0|the example of Lou Gehrig, if I 
20101224144818.499|20101224144820.161|TR0|may tell you about that. Lou 
20101224144820.161|20101224144821.823|TR0|Gehrig was this great baseball 
20101224144821.823|20101224144823.484|TR0|player, a teammate of Babe 
20101224144823.484|20101224144825.146|TR0|Ruth's on the New York Yankees. 
20101224144825.146|20101224144826.808|TR0|And he set a record for 
20101224144826.808|20101224144828.470|TR0|consecutive games played that 
20101224144828.470|20101224144830.132|TR0|stood for nearly sixty years. 
20101224144830.132|20101224144831.794|TR0|Now, Gehrig wasn't just a great 
20101224144831.794|20101224144833.456|TR0|athlete. He was also dutiful. He 
20101224144833.456|20101224144835.118|TR0|- it's not that he was never 
20101224144835.118|20101224144836.780|TR0|hurt. At one point, his hands 
20101224144836.780|20101224144838.442|TR0|were x-rayed. It turns out his 
20101224144838.442|20101224144840.104|TR0|fingers had been fractured 
20101224144840.104|20101224144841.766|TR0|seventeen separate times. And 
20101224144841.766|20101224144843.428|TR0|his teammates described him as 
20101224144843.428|20101224144845.090|TR0|grimacing like a mad monkey in 
20101224144845.090|20101224144846.752|TR0|agony when he fielded the ball. 
20101224144846.752|20101224144848.414|TR0|But he never took himself out of 
20101224144848.414|20101224144850.076|TR0|a game, because he was too 
20101224144850.076|20101224144851.738|TR0|dutiful to his own self-image 
20101224144851.738|20101224144853.400|TR0|and also to the fans and to the 
20101224144853.400|20101224144855.062|TR0|owners. Now, that sense of 
20101224144855.062|20101224144856.724|TR0|responsibility, and not looking 
20101224144856.724|20101224144858.385|TR0|after yourself, is totally 
20101224144858.385|20101224144900.047|TR0|typical of everybody who 
20101224144900.047|20101224144901.709|TR0|develops ALS.
20101224144901.709|20101224144903.371|TR0|
20101224144903.371|20101224144905.033|TR0|And it goes back to their 
20101224144905.033|20101224144906.695|TR0|childhoods. Lou Gehrig's father 
20101224144906.695|20101224144908.357|TR0|was an alcoholic, and Gehrig 
20101224144908.357|20101224144910.019|TR0|learned very early in life that 
20101224144910.019|20101224144911.681|TR0|he had to take care of others, 
20101224144911.681|20101224144913.343|TR0|as the children of alcoholics 
20101224144913.343|20101224144915.005|TR0|often do. And that then became 
20101224144915.005|20101224144916.667|TR0|his pattern until he could no 
20101224144916.667|20101224144918.329|TR0|longer drag himself around the 
20101224144918.329|20101224144919.991|TR0|baseball diamond because of the 
20101224144919.991|20101224144921.653|TR0|ALS, which in North America, of 
20101224144921.653|20101224144923.315|TR0|course, is known as Lou Gehrig's 
20101224144923.315|20101224144924.977|TR0|disease.
20101224144924.977|20101224144926.639|TR0|
20101224144926.639|20101224144928.301|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk 
20101224144928.301|20101224144929.963|TR0|about children, when it comes to 
20101224144929.963|20101224144931.624|TR0|this? And then expand, because, 
20101224144931.624|20101224144933.286|TR0|Gabor, a few weeks ago we were 
20101224144933.286|20101224144934.948|TR0|talking about addictions, and 
20101224144934.948|20101224144936.610|TR0|that's both, what, heroin 
20101224144936.610|20101224144938.272|TR0|addiction, but expanding it to 
20101224144938.272|20101224144939.934|TR0|other addictions, as well, and 
20101224144939.934|20101224144941.596|TR0|the role of childhood. And in 
20101224144941.596|20101224144943.258|TR0|doing this, though you talked 
20101224144943.258|20101224144944.920|TR0|about it before, talk about your 
20101224144944.920|20101224144946.582|TR0|own.
20101224144946.582|20101224144948.244|TR0|
20101224144948.244|20101224144949.906|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Well, again, 
20101224144949.906|20101224144951.568|TR0|in the book When the Body Says 
20101224144951.568|20101224144953.230|TR0|No, I give the example of my 
20101224144953.230|20101224144954.892|TR0|visiting my mother one day in a 
20101224144954.892|20101224144956.554|TR0|nursing home. My mother had 
20101224144956.554|20101224144958.216|TR0|muscular dystrophy, which is a 
20101224144958.216|20101224144959.878|TR0|degenerative disease of the 
20101224144959.878|20101224145001.540|TR0|muscles. It's hereditary, runs 
20101224145001.540|20101224145003.202|TR0|in our family. And so, she could 
20101224145003.202|20101224145004.863|TR0|no longer walk, get out of bed, 
20101224145004.863|20101224145006.525|TR0|even feed herself very well, so 
20101224145006.525|20101224145008.187|TR0|she was in a nursing home, 
20101224145008.187|20101224145009.849|TR0|mentally completely with it and 
20101224145009.849|20101224145011.511|TR0|emotionally very strong.
20101224145011.511|20101224145013.173|TR0|
20101224145013.173|20101224145014.835|TR0|So I'm walking down the hall of 
20101224145014.835|20101224145016.497|TR0|the nursing home that day, and 
20101224145016.497|20101224145018.159|TR0|I'm limping a little bit. And 
20101224145018.159|20101224145019.821|TR0|why am I limping? Because that 
20101224145019.821|20101224145021.483|TR0|morning I had arthroscopic 
20101224145021.483|20101224145023.145|TR0|surgery on my knee, which I had 
20101224145023.145|20101224145024.807|TR0|to have because I tore up 
20101224145024.807|20101224145026.469|TR0|cartilage in my knee jogging on 
20101224145026.469|20101224145028.131|TR0|cement. So I have a little bit 
20101224145028.131|20101224145029.793|TR0|of a limp that afternoon. When I 
20101224145029.793|20101224145031.455|TR0|get to my mother's room, I 
20101224145031.455|20101224145033.117|TR0|suppress the limp. The limp 
20101224145033.117|20101224145034.779|TR0|disappears. I walk to her bed 
20101224145034.779|20101224145036.441|TR0|nonchalantly, greet her, we have 
20101224145036.441|20101224145038.103|TR0|a lovely visit. I walk out of 
20101224145038.103|20101224145039.764|TR0|the room with a perfectly normal 
20101224145039.764|20101224145041.426|TR0|gait, and when I shut the door 
20101224145041.426|20101224145043.088|TR0|behind me, my limp begins again.
20101224145043.088|20101224145044.750|TR0|
20101224145044.750|20101224145046.412|TR0|And only later on did I think, 
20101224145046.412|20101224145048.074|TR0|"What am I doing here?" It 
20101224145048.074|20101224145049.736|TR0|wasn't conscious. I didn't do it 
20101224145049.736|20101224145051.398|TR0|deliberately. Of course, 
20101224145051.398|20101224145053.060|TR0|clearly, I was trying to protect 
20101224145053.060|20101224145054.722|TR0|my mom from the awareness of my 
20101224145054.722|20101224145056.384|TR0|pain. Now, my mother, at age 78, 
20101224145056.384|20101224145058.046|TR0|did not need to be protected 
20101224145058.046|20101224145059.708|TR0|from the fact that her 
20101224145059.708|20101224145101.370|TR0|middle-age son had to be with a 
20101224145101.370|20101224145103.032|TR0|limp the day of surgery. It was 
20101224145103.032|20101224145104.694|TR0|a childhood-ingrained mechanism 
20101224145104.694|20101224145106.356|TR0|going back, again, to my first 
20101224145106.356|20101224145108.018|TR0|year of life in the ghetto of 
20101224145108.018|20101224145109.680|TR0|Budapest, when, as I mentioned 
20101224145109.680|20101224145111.342|TR0|in my first visit to your 
20101224145111.342|20101224145113.003|TR0|program, we lived under Nazi 
20101224145113.003|20101224145114.665|TR0|occupation, a Jewish family. My 
20101224145114.665|20101224145116.327|TR0|father was away in forced labor. 
20101224145116.327|20101224145117.989|TR0|My mother was a highly stressed 
20101224145117.989|20101224145119.651|TR0|woman, trying to do her best to 
20101224145119.651|20101224145121.313|TR0|ensure my and her survival, 
20101224145121.313|20101224145122.975|TR0|which she was barely able to do. 
20101224145122.975|20101224145124.637|TR0|I learned as an infant to 
20101224145124.637|20101224145126.299|TR0|suppress my pain to protect her 
20101224145126.299|20101224145127.961|TR0|from it, because she already had 
20101224145127.961|20101224145129.623|TR0|too much, in order to protect my 
20101224145129.623|20101224145131.285|TR0|relationship with her. Now, 
20101224145131.285|20101224145132.947|TR0|those emotional patterns are 
20101224145132.947|20101224145134.609|TR0|ingrained in children from early 
20101224145134.609|20101224145136.271|TR0|on. And although I have no 
20101224145136.271|20101224145137.933|TR0|recollection of that time in my 
20101224145137.933|20101224145139.595|TR0|life, the memory of it lives in 
20101224145139.595|20101224145141.257|TR0|my cells and lives in my brain 
20101224145141.257|20101224145142.919|TR0|and shows up in my interactions 
20101224145142.919|20101224145144.581|TR0|with people, including in that 
20101224145144.581|20101224145146.243|TR0|example of trying to protect my 
20101224145146.243|20101224145147.904|TR0|mother.
20101224145147.904|20101224145149.566|TR0|
20101224145149.566|20101224145151.228|TR0|So, the point is that human 
20101224145151.228|20101224145152.890|TR0|beings are shaped very early by 
20101224145152.890|20101224145154.552|TR0|what happens to them in life. As 
20101224145154.552|20101224145156.214|TR0|a matter of fact, they're shaped 
20101224145156.214|20101224145157.876|TR0|already by what happens in 
20101224145157.876|20101224145159.538|TR0|uterus. After 9/11, after the 
20101224145159.538|20101224145201.200|TR0|World Trade disasters in those 
20101224145201.200|20101224145202.862|TR0|terrorist attacks, some women 
20101224145202.862|20101224145204.524|TR0|who were pregnant suffered PTSD, 
20101224145204.524|20101224145206.186|TR0|post-traumatic stress disorder. 
20101224145206.186|20101224145207.848|TR0|And depending on what stage of 
20101224145207.848|20101224145209.510|TR0|pregnancy they suffered the 
20101224145209.510|20101224145211.172|TR0|PTSD, when they measured their 
20101224145211.172|20101224145212.834|TR0|children's cortisol levels - 
20101224145212.834|20101224145214.496|TR0|cortisol being a body stress 
20101224145214.496|20101224145216.158|TR0|hormone - at one year of age, 
20101224145216.158|20101224145217.820|TR0|those kids had abnormal cortisol 
20101224145217.820|20101224145219.482|TR0|levels. In other words, their 
20101224145219.482|20101224145221.143|TR0|stress apparatus had been 
20101224145221.143|20101224145222.805|TR0|negatively affected by the 
20101224145222.805|20101224145224.467|TR0|mother's stress during 
20101224145224.467|20101224145226.129|TR0|pregnancy. Similarly, for 
20101224145226.129|20101224145227.791|TR0|example, when I looked at the 
20101224145227.791|20101224145229.453|TR0|stress hormone levels of the 
20101224145229.453|20101224145231.115|TR0|children of Holocaust survivors 
20101224145231.115|20101224145232.777|TR0|with PTSD, the greater the 
20101224145232.777|20101224145234.439|TR0|degree of PTSD of the parent, 
20101224145234.439|20101224145236.101|TR0|the higher the stress hormone 
20101224145236.101|20101224145237.763|TR0|level of the child.
20101224145237.763|20101224145239.425|TR0|
20101224145239.425|20101224145241.087|TR0|So, how we see the world, 
20101224145241.087|20101224145242.749|TR0|whether the world is a hostile 
20101224145242.749|20101224145244.411|TR0|or friendly place, whether we 
20101224145244.411|20101224145246.073|TR0|have to always do for ourselves 
20101224145246.073|20101224145247.735|TR0|and look after others or whether 
20101224145247.735|20101224145249.397|TR0|we can actually expect and 
20101224145249.397|20101224145251.059|TR0|receive help from the world, 
20101224145251.059|20101224145252.721|TR0|whether or not the world is 
20101224145252.721|20101224145254.382|TR0|hostile or friendly, and indeed 
20101224145254.382|20101224145256.044|TR0|our stress physiology, is very 
20101224145256.044|20101224145257.706|TR0|much shaped by those early 
20101224145257.706|20101224145259.368|TR0|experiences. And that's then 
20101224145259.368|20101224145301.030|TR0|what we act out much of our 
20101224145301.030|20101224145302.692|TR0|lives, and that's then what 
20101224145302.692|20101224145304.354|TR0|interferes and affects our 
20101224145304.354|20101224145306.016|TR0|health later on.
20101224145306.016|20101224145307.678|TR0|
20101224145307.678|20101224145309.340|TR0|The implication of this, Amy, 
20101224145309.340|20101224145311.002|TR0|for treatment is that when 
20101224145311.002|20101224145312.664|TR0|somebody comes in with a first 
20101224145312.664|20101224145314.326|TR0|episode of rheumatoid arthritis 
20101224145314.326|20101224145315.988|TR0|or multiple sclerosis, or even a 
20101224145315.988|20101224145317.650|TR0|diagnosis of cancer, it's not 
20101224145317.650|20101224145319.312|TR0|enough to give them pills. It's 
20101224145319.312|20101224145320.974|TR0|not enough to give them 
20101224145320.974|20101224145322.636|TR0|radiation or offer them surgery. 
20101224145322.636|20101224145324.298|TR0|They should also be talked to 
20101224145324.298|20101224145325.960|TR0|and invited to and encouraged to 
20101224145325.960|20101224145327.622|TR0|investigate how they live their 
20101224145327.622|20101224145329.283|TR0|lives and how they stress 
20101224145329.283|20101224145330.945|TR0|themselves, because I can tell 
20101224145330.945|20101224145332.607|TR0|you from personal experience and 
20101224145332.607|20101224145334.269|TR0|observation that people who do 
20101224145334.269|20101224145335.931|TR0|that, who take a broader 
20101224145335.931|20101224145337.593|TR0|approach to their own health, 
20101224145337.593|20101224145339.255|TR0|they actually do a lot better.
20101224145339.255|20101224145340.917|TR0|
20101224145340.917|20101224145342.579|TR0|And I know people who have 
20101224145342.579|20101224145344.241|TR0|survived supposedly terminal 
20101224145344.241|20101224145345.903|TR0|diagnoses simply because they've 
20101224145345.903|20101224145347.565|TR0|taken their own mind-body unity, 
20101224145347.565|20101224145349.227|TR0|and I would say spiritual unity, 
20101224145349.227|20101224145350.889|TR0|as well, seriously, and they've 
20101224145350.889|20101224145352.551|TR0|gone beyond a narrow medical 
20101224145352.551|20101224145354.213|TR0|model of treatment. And I'm not 
20101224145354.213|20101224145355.875|TR0|here to disparage the value of 
20101224145355.875|20101224145357.537|TR0|the medical approach in which I 
20101224145357.537|20101224145359.199|TR0|was trained. I'm just saying 
20101224145359.199|20101224145400.861|TR0|that it's hopelessly narrow, and 
20101224145400.861|20101224145402.522|TR0|it leaves many people without 
20101224145402.522|20101224145404.184|TR0|appropriate treatment and 
20101224145404.184|20101224145405.846|TR0|appropriate support.

20101224145412.494|20101224145414.156|TR0|as ACEs  --

20101224145415.818|20101224145417.480|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: Yes, there 
20101224145417.480|20101224145419.142|TR0|was a -
20101224145419.142|20101224145420.804|TR0|
20101224145420.804|20101224145422.466|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: - and their 
20101224145422.466|20101224145424.128|TR0|connection also to addiction, 
20101224145424.128|20101224145425.790|TR0|this latest book that you have 
20101224145425.790|20101224145427.452|TR0|written, In the Realm of Hungry 
20101224145427.452|20101224145429.114|TR0|Ghosts.
20101224145429.114|20101224145430.776|TR0|
20101224145430.776|20101224145432.438|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: There was a 
20101224145432.438|20101224145434.100|TR0|number of large-scale studies in 
20101224145434.100|20101224145435.762|TR0|the United States done by very 
20101224145435.762|20101224145437.423|TR0|brilliant researchers called the 
20101224145437.423|20101224145439.085|TR0|ACE studies, A-C-E, adverse 
20101224145439.085|20101224145440.747|TR0|childhood experiences. An 
20101224145440.747|20101224145442.409|TR0|adverse childhood experience is 
20101224145442.409|20101224145444.071|TR0|a child being abused or violence 
20101224145444.071|20101224145445.733|TR0|in the family or a parent being 
20101224145445.733|20101224145447.395|TR0|jailed or extreme stress of 
20101224145447.395|20101224145449.057|TR0|poverty or a rancorous divorce, 
20101224145449.057|20101224145450.719|TR0|a parent being addicted, 
20101224145450.719|20101224145452.381|TR0|alcoholic and so on.
20101224145452.381|20101224145454.043|TR0|
20101224145454.043|20101224145455.705|TR0|When it comes to addiction, 
20101224145455.705|20101224145457.367|TR0|these effects are addictive, so 
20101224145457.367|20101224145459.029|TR0|that if a child has a number of 
20101224145459.029|20101224145500.691|TR0|these adverse childhood 
20101224145500.691|20101224145502.353|TR0|experiences, his chance of 
20101224145502.353|20101224145504.015|TR0|becoming a drug addict later on, 
20101224145504.015|20101224145505.677|TR0|or any kind of an addict, go up 
20101224145505.677|20101224145507.339|TR0|exponentially. So a male child 
20101224145507.339|20101224145509.001|TR0|with six such adverse childhood 
20101224145509.001|20101224145510.662|TR0|experiences has a 4,600 percent 
20101224145510.662|20101224145512.324|TR0|increase in the risk of him 
20101224145512.324|20101224145513.986|TR0|becoming an injection-using 
20101224145513.986|20101224145515.648|TR0|substance addict than a male 
20101224145515.648|20101224145517.310|TR0|child with no such experiences - 
20101224145517.310|20101224145518.972|TR0|in other words, a 46-fold 
20101224145518.972|20101224145520.634|TR0|increase in the risk.
20101224145520.634|20101224145522.296|TR0|
20101224145522.296|20101224145523.958|TR0|And interestingly enough, those 
20101224145523.958|20101224145525.620|TR0|adverse childhood experiences 
20101224145525.620|20101224145527.282|TR0|also exponentially increase the 
20101224145527.282|20101224145528.944|TR0|risk of cancer and high blood 
20101224145528.944|20101224145530.606|TR0|pressure and heart disease and a 
20101224145530.606|20101224145532.268|TR0|whole range of other diseases, 
20101224145532.268|20101224145533.930|TR0|as well as suicide, of course, 
20101224145533.930|20101224145535.592|TR0|and early death. In other words, 
20101224145535.592|20101224145537.254|TR0|there's a real connection 
20101224145537.254|20101224145538.916|TR0|between early childhood 
20101224145538.916|20101224145540.578|TR0|adversity and how a person lives 
20101224145540.578|20101224145542.240|TR0|their lives and a later 
20101224145542.240|20101224145543.902|TR0|appearance of addiction and 
20101224145543.902|20101224145545.563|TR0|diseases, physical and of course 
20101224145545.563|20101224145547.225|TR0|mental illnesses at the same 
20101224145547.225|20101224145548.887|TR0|time.
20101224145548.887|20101224145550.549|TR0|
20101224145550.549|20101224145552.211|TR0|And if we don't take this into 
20101224145552.211|20101224145553.873|TR0|account in medicine - most of 
20101224145553.873|20101224145555.535|TR0|the time, people are not asked 
20101224145555.535|20101224145557.197|TR0|about these things in doctors' 
20101224145557.197|20101224145558.859|TR0|offices, and they're not 
20101224145558.859|20101224145600.521|TR0|explored. They're not encouraged 
20101224145600.521|20101224145602.183|TR0|to explore their childhoods and 
20101224145602.183|20101224145603.845|TR0|the kind of impact that the 
20101224145603.845|20101224145605.507|TR0|childhood has on their adult 
20101224145605.507|20101224145607.169|TR0|behaviors.
20101224145607.169|20101224145608.831|TR0|
20101224145608.831|20101224145610.493|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: As we wrap up 
20101224145610.493|20101224145612.155|TR0|this part of our discussion, 
20101224145612.155|20101224145613.817|TR0|what do you think are the most 
20101224145613.817|20101224145615.479|TR0|useful ways people can deal with 
20101224145615.479|20101224145617.141|TR0|stress, with the mind-body 
20101224145617.141|20101224145618.802|TR0|connection, both people 
20101224145618.802|20101224145620.464|TR0|themselves and also what doctors 
20101224145620.464|20101224145622.126|TR0|should be telling their 
20101224145622.126|20101224145623.788|TR0|patients, or what patients 
20101224145623.788|20101224145625.450|TR0|should be telling their doctors?
20101224145625.450|20101224145627.112|TR0|
20101224145627.112|20101224145628.774|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: The body has 
20101224145628.774|20101224145630.436|TR0|many ways of saying no: almost 
20101224145630.436|20101224145632.098|TR0|any symptom, a stomach ache, a 
20101224145632.098|20101224145633.760|TR0|back spasm, a headache, nausea, 
20101224145633.760|20101224145635.422|TR0|dry mouth, poor sleep, muscle 
20101224145635.422|20101224145637.084|TR0|tension. I'm talking about 
20101224145637.084|20101224145638.746|TR0|relatively minor symptoms. These 
20101224145638.746|20101224145640.408|TR0|are all ways of the body saying 
20101224145640.408|20101224145642.070|TR0|no. As of course are the more 
20101224145642.070|20101224145643.732|TR0|severe conditions, like 
20101224145643.732|20101224145645.394|TR0|psoriasis or ulcerative colitis, 
20101224145645.394|20101224145647.056|TR0|all the ones that I've already 
20101224145647.056|20101224145648.718|TR0|mentioned. These are all ways of 
20101224145648.718|20101224145650.380|TR0|the body saying no.
20101224145650.380|20101224145652.041|TR0|
20101224145652.041|20101224145653.703|TR0|We need to, first of all, to say 
20101224145653.703|20101224145655.365|TR0|and pay attention to what the 
20101224145655.365|20101224145657.027|TR0|body is saying to us. So if we 
20101224145657.027|20101224145658.689|TR0|have a symptom, don't just go to 
20101224145658.689|20101224145700.351|TR0|the doctor and say, "Take this 
20101224145700.351|20101224145702.013|TR0|symptom away from me" - yeah, 
20101224145702.013|20101224145703.675|TR0|ask for help - but also explore 
20101224145703.675|20101224145705.337|TR0|what the body is saying no to. 
20101224145705.337|20101224145706.999|TR0|Usually you'll find that in your 
20101224145706.999|20101224145708.661|TR0|life you've taken on too much, 
20101224145708.661|20101224145710.323|TR0|you're suppressing yourself, 
20101224145710.323|20101224145711.985|TR0|you're trying to please others 
20101224145711.985|20101224145713.647|TR0|too much. You're living life 
20101224145713.647|20101224145715.309|TR0|along patterns that don't 
20101224145715.309|20101224145716.971|TR0|express who you really are. So 
20101224145716.971|20101224145718.633|TR0|the symptom or the disease ought 
20101224145718.633|20101224145720.295|TR0|to be not just something that 
20101224145720.295|20101224145721.957|TR0|you want to get rid of; it ought 
20101224145721.957|20101224145723.619|TR0|to be the beginning of an 
20101224145723.619|20101224145725.281|TR0|exploration and investigation of 
20101224145725.281|20101224145726.942|TR0|how you live your life and how 
20101224145726.942|20101224145728.604|TR0|you might possibly live your 
20101224145728.604|20101224145730.266|TR0|life differently, in a more 
20101224145730.266|20101224145731.928|TR0|healthy fashion.

20101224145733.590|20101224145735.252|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And do you think 
20101224145735.252|20101224145736.914|TR0|modern medicine is dealing 
20101224145736.914|20101224145738.576|TR0|better, Western medicine, with 
20101224145738.576|20101224145740.238|TR0|this, with the mind-body 
20101224145740.238|20101224145741.900|TR0|connection?
20101224145741.900|20101224145743.562|TR0|
20101224145743.562|20101224145745.224|TR0|>> DR. GABOR MATE: There are 
20101224145745.224|20101224145746.886|TR0|encouraging signs. There's 
20101224145746.886|20101224145748.548|TR0|certainly people like Jon 
20101224145748.548|20101224145750.210|TR0|Kabat-Zinn, who talks about 
20101224145750.210|20101224145751.872|TR0|stress and mindfulness, and 
20101224145751.872|20101224145753.534|TR0|Andrew Weil, who talks about the 
20101224145753.534|20101224145755.196|TR0|importance of nutrition and a 
20101224145755.196|20101224145756.858|TR0|more holistic approach. So there 
20101224145756.858|20101224145758.520|TR0|are many people doing great work.
20101224145758.520|20101224145800.181|TR0|
20101224145800.181|20101224145801.843|TR0|But if I look at the profession 
20101224145801.843|20101224145803.505|TR0|as a whole, we're doing a dismal 
20101224145803.505|20101224145805.167|TR0|job. And we're spending billions 
20101224145805.167|20101224145806.829|TR0|of dollars on researches into 
20101224145806.829|20101224145808.491|TR0|cancer and so on that are never 
20101224145808.491|20101224145810.153|TR0|going to get us anywhere, 
20101224145810.153|20101224145811.815|TR0|because we ignore the life 
20101224145811.815|20101224145813.477|TR0|stresses that very often, if 
20101224145813.477|20101224145815.139|TR0|they don't by themselves cause, 
20101224145815.139|20101224145816.801|TR0|they certainly contribute in a 
20101224145816.801|20101224145818.463|TR0|major way to the onset of 
20101224145818.463|20101224145820.125|TR0|disease. But we're not looking 
20101224145820.125|20101224145821.787|TR0|at them. We're not dealing with 
20101224145821.787|20101224145823.449|TR0|them. And we're leaving people 
20101224145823.449|20101224145825.111|TR0|without the appropriate tools to 
20101224145825.111|20101224145826.773|TR0|restore their own health.
