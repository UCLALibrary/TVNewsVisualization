20101224230012.000|20101224230015.000|TR0|MICHAEL J. FOX, ACTOR:  With Parkinson's, 
20101224230015.000|20101224230017.000|TR0|it's like you're crossing the road and you 
20101224230017.000|20101224230020.000|TR0|get stuck in the middle.  And you know the 
20101224230020.000|20101224230023.000|TR0|bus is coming, and you can't get out of 
20101224230023.000|20101224230025.000|TR0|the way.
20101224230025.000|20101224230028.000|TR0|
20101224230028.000|20101224230031.000|TR0|So, you can kind of freak out and you can 
20101224230031.000|20101224230033.000|TR0|kind of go, well, that bus is going to hit 
20101224230033.000|20101224230036.000|TR0|me at some point, even though you don't 
20101224230036.000|20101224230039.000|TR0|know how fast or how big.

20101224230047.000|20101224230050.000|TR0|DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL 
20101224230050.000|20101224230052.000|TR0|CORRESPONDENT:  There's so much we don't 
20101224230052.000|20101224230055.000|TR0|know about Parkinson disease.  What 
20101224230055.000|20101224230058.000|TR0|exactly causes for it, for instance, and 
20101224230058.000|20101224230100.000|TR0|why would someone at the age of 29 start 
20101224230100.000|20101224230103.000|TR0|to develop the symptoms?  No one knows.
20101224230103.000|20101224230106.000|TR0|
20101224230106.000|20101224230109.000|TR0|But this, we do know.  Michael J. Fox has 
20101224230109.000|20101224230111.000|TR0|in many ways become the handsome face of 
20101224230111.000|20101224230114.000|TR0|Parkinson's.  Did you know that he's had 
20101224230114.000|20101224230117.000|TR0|the disease for almost 19 years now?  What 
20101224230117.000|20101224230119.000|TR0|is his life like day to day?  And what is 
20101224230119.000|20101224230122.000|TR0|he planning on doing with the $200 million 
20101224230122.000|20101224230125.000|TR0|he's raised through his foundation?  What 
20101224230125.000|20101224230127.000|TR0|can we all learn in him?
20101224230127.000|20101224230130.000|TR0|
20101224230130.000|20101224230133.000|TR0|I will tell you, he doesn't do a lot of 
20101224230133.000|20101224230135.000|TR0|long interviews, because he gets so tired 
20101224230135.000|20101224230138.000|TR0|nowadays.  But, on this day, he had a lot 
20101224230138.000|20101224230141.000|TR0|to say.
20101224230141.000|20101224230144.000|TR0|
20101224230144.000|20101224230146.000|TR0|(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
20101224230146.000|20101224230149.000|TR0|
20101224230149.000|20101224230152.000|TR0|GUPTA:  People, when I said I was going to 
20101224230152.000|20101224230154.000|TR0|be interviewing you, people would ask me, 
20101224230154.000|20101224230157.000|TR0|how's he doing?  And, again, I don't want 
20101224230157.000|20101224230200.000|TR0|to belabor that, but I'm just -- you're 
20101224230200.000|20101224230202.000|TR0|doing OK?
20101224230202.000|20101224230205.000|TR0|
20101224230205.000|20101224230208.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes.
20101224230208.000|20101224230211.000|TR0|
20101224230211.000|20101224230213.000|TR0|What I was going say that I refer to 
20101224230213.000|20101224230216.000|TR0|Parkinson's and the effect it's had on my 
20101224230216.000|20101224230219.000|TR0|life as a gift.  And people are completely 
20101224230219.000|20101224230221.000|TR0|dubious of that and kind of wonder how I 
20101224230221.000|20101224230224.000|TR0|could say that.
20101224230224.000|20101224230227.000|TR0|
20101224230227.000|20101224230229.000|TR0|But I quantify it -- qualify it by saying 
20101224230229.000|20101224230232.000|TR0|it's a gift that keeps on taking, but it 
20101224230232.000|20101224230235.000|TR0|is a gift, because it's really opened me 
20101224230235.000|20101224230238.000|TR0|up to more kind of compassionate, curious, 
20101224230238.000|20101224230240.000|TR0|risk-taking person.  And it's given me -- 
20101224230240.000|20101224230243.000|TR0|I wouldn't call the foundation my magnum 
20101224230243.000|20101224230246.000|TR0|opus, but it's definitely the most 
20101224230246.000|20101224230248.000|TR0|important thing I have ever done or will 
20101224230248.000|20101224230251.000|TR0|probably do in my life.
20101224230251.000|20101224230254.000|TR0|
20101224230254.000|20101224230256.000|TR0|GUPTA:  With a disease like Parkinson's, 
20101224230256.000|20101224230259.000|TR0|with humidity, for example, what's 
20101224230259.000|20101224230302.000|TR0|happening?  What do you experience?
20101224230302.000|20101224230304.000|TR0|
20101224230304.000|20101224230307.000|TR0|FOX:  Everybody has their own thing.  
20101224230307.000|20101224230310.000|TR0|Everybody has their own version of it.
20101224230310.000|20101224230313.000|TR0|
20101224230313.000|20101224230315.000|TR0|I'm on and off.  It's the story of my 
20101224230315.000|20101224230318.000|TR0|life, is when I'm on and when I'm off.  
20101224230318.000|20101224230321.000|TR0|For example, now, I'm relatively on.  And, 
20101224230321.000|20101224230323.000|TR0|in the course of this interview, I will 
20101224230323.000|20101224230326.000|TR0|probably go towards being off.
20101224230326.000|20101224230329.000|TR0|
20101224230329.000|20101224230331.000|TR0|And I will try to correct that midstream 
20101224230331.000|20101224230334.000|TR0|with medication.  But, sometimes, I catch 
20101224230334.000|20101224230337.000|TR0|it.  Sometimes, I don't.  And, sometimes, 
20101224230337.000|20101224230340.000|TR0|my brain is more receptive to it, and 
20101224230340.000|20101224230342.000|TR0|sometimes it isn't.
20101224230342.000|20101224230345.000|TR0|
20101224230345.000|20101224230348.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You're trying grab something.  And 
20101224230348.000|20101224230350.000|TR0|if the brakes are off, so to speak, you 
20101224230350.000|20101224230353.000|TR0|will shake.  Right now, when you're 
20101224230353.000|20101224230356.000|TR0|moving, like I see you're grabbing your 
20101224230356.000|20101224230358.000|TR0|left leg, are you trying to tell your left 
20101224230358.000|20101224230401.000|TR0|leg not to move?  Like, is that something 
20101224230401.000|20101224230404.000|TR0|that you're constantly thinking about?  
20101224230404.000|20101224230407.000|TR0|Or...
20101224230407.000|20101224230409.000|TR0|
20101224230409.000|20101224230412.000|TR0|FOX:  You know something?  It's like 
20101224230412.000|20101224230415.000|TR0|Whac-A-Mole.  It's like the arm will go.  
20101224230415.000|20101224230417.000|TR0|If I stop the arm, the other arm will go.  
20101224230417.000|20101224230420.000|TR0|I sit down, the leg will go, cross the 
20101224230420.000|20101224230423.000|TR0|leg.  It's going to go somewhere.
20101224230423.000|20101224230425.000|TR0|
20101224230425.000|20101224230428.000|TR0|So it's constantly moving it around until 
20101224230428.000|20101224230431.000|TR0|-- and then there will be times when I 
20101224230431.000|20101224230433.000|TR0|will just be stop and be still.  Right 
20101224230433.000|20101224230436.000|TR0|now, for example, if I wasn't talking with 
20101224230436.000|20101224230439.000|TR0|you, if I was just sitting, I would be 
20101224230439.000|20101224230442.000|TR0|perfectly still.
20101224230442.000|20101224230444.000|TR0|
20101224230444.000|20101224230447.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Is that the stress part of it?  Or 
20101224230447.000|20101224230450.000|TR0|is that...
20101224230450.000|20101224230452.000|TR0|
20101224230452.000|20101224230455.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20101224230455.000|20101224230458.000|TR0|
20101224230458.000|20101224230500.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes.  That's just -- again, it's 
20101224230500.000|20101224230503.000|TR0|like the stuff that fires that tells you I 
20101224230503.000|20101224230506.000|TR0|want to pick up this glass is firing to 
20101224230506.000|20101224230509.000|TR0|tell me that something's required of me 
20101224230509.000|20101224230511.000|TR0|here.  And my mind can't tell my brain 
20101224230511.000|20101224230514.000|TR0|what it is.
20101224230514.000|20101224230517.000|TR0|
20101224230517.000|20101224230519.000|TR0|GUPTA:  When you wake up in the morning, 
20101224230519.000|20101224230522.000|TR0|is there a certain routine you have to go 
20101224230522.000|20101224230525.000|TR0|through?  Do you take your med at a 
20101224230525.000|20101224230527.000|TR0|certain time then?  Or do you feel a 
20101224230527.000|20101224230530.000|TR0|certain way?
20101224230530.000|20101224230533.000|TR0|
20101224230533.000|20101224230536.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)
20101224230536.000|20101224230538.000|TR0|
20101224230538.000|20101224230541.000|TR0|FOX:  Well, it changes.  But, for the most 
20101224230541.000|20101224230544.000|TR0|part, when I wake up, I have a feature 
20101224230544.000|20101224230546.000|TR0|called dystonia, which is a rigidity, a 
20101224230546.000|20101224230549.000|TR0|cramping.
20101224230549.000|20101224230552.000|TR0|
20101224230552.000|20101224230554.000|TR0|With me, it affects my feet.  So, 
20101224230554.000|20101224230557.000|TR0|strangely enough, the first time my wife 
20101224230557.000|20101224230600.000|TR0|often hears me in the morning is me 
20101224230600.000|20101224230602.000|TR0|clumping across the floor, because I keep 
20101224230602.000|20101224230605.000|TR0|a hard pair of shoes right next to the 
20101224230605.000|20101224230608.000|TR0|bed.  And I wake up and I put them on and 
20101224230608.000|20101224230611.000|TR0|immediately the stiffness of the shoe kind 
20101224230611.000|20101224230613.000|TR0|of forces the feet to behave.
20101224230613.000|20101224230616.000|TR0|
20101224230616.000|20101224230619.000|TR0|And then I wait probably about 
20101224230619.000|20101224230621.000|TR0|half-an-hour, 45 minutes before I -- I 
20101224230621.000|20101224230624.000|TR0|might take a half-a-pill just to get me 
20101224230624.000|20101224230627.000|TR0|started.  But I might wait a couple hours 
20101224230627.000|20101224230629.000|TR0|before -- depending on what my day 
20101224230629.000|20101224230632.000|TR0|requires of me before I really kick in.
20101224230632.000|20101224230635.000|TR0|
20101224230635.000|20101224230638.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Things like even tending to 
20101224230638.000|20101224230640.000|TR0|yourself, brushing your hair, brushing 
20101224230640.000|20101224230643.000|TR0|your teeth?
20101224230643.000|20101224230646.000|TR0|
20101224230646.000|20101224230648.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)

20101224230729.000|20101224230731.000|TR0|the result is going to be the same.  
20101224230731.000|20101224230734.000|TR0|You're not going to go forward.  You're

20101224230750.000|20101224230753.000|TR0|may seem, people are sick of seeing me.  
20101224230753.000|20101224230756.000|TR0|But it carries with it a certain amount of 
20101224230756.000|20101224230758.000|TR0|stress. No matter how congenial and

20101224230938.000|20101224230941.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Fox had first publicly disclosed 
20101224230941.000|20101224230944.000|TR0|his Parkinson's diagnosis two years early. 
20101224230944.000|20101224230946.000|TR0| But the long hours on set were catching 
20101224230946.000|20101224230949.000|TR0|up with him, exacerbating the symptoms of 
20101224230949.000|20101224230952.000|TR0|his disease.

20101224230954.000|20101224230957.000|TR0|FOX:  The stress of doing the show is kind 
20101224230957.000|20101224231000.000|TR0|of an X-factor.  It's going to be 
20101224231000.000|20101224231003.000|TR0|interesting to see that removed from the

20101224231008.000|20101224231011.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Fox's decision to step away from 
20101224231011.000|20101224231013.000|TR0|the cameras was a dramatic change for a 
20101224231013.000|20101224231016.000|TR0|man who practically grew up on screen, 
20101224231016.000|20101224231019.000|TR0|launching his television career in the

20101224231102.000|20101224231105.000|TR0|Fox's work on the series won him three

20101224231156.000|20101224231158.000|TR0|Marty McFly with more than 20 films.  But 
20101224231158.000|20101224231201.000|TR0|it was on the set of the movie "Doc 
20101224231201.000|20101224231204.000|TR0|Hollywood" where Fox first displayed 
20101224231204.000|20101224231207.000|TR0|symptoms of early Parkinson's disease, 
20101224231207.000|20101224231209.000|TR0|which eventually pushed him into a new

20101224231225.000|20101224231228.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Fox works tirelessly in his quest 
20101224231228.000|20101224231231.000|TR0|for a cure for Parkinson's, fighting for 
20101224231231.000|20101224231234.000|TR0|funding, campaigning for politicians

20101224231435.000|20101224231438.000|TR0|FOX:  My natural state is pretty kinetic 
20101224231438.000|20101224231440.000|TR0|and (INAUDIBLE) and trembling, until I get 
20101224231440.000|20101224231443.000|TR0|to the point where I have no movement at 
20101224231443.000|20101224231446.000|TR0|all.
20101224231446.000|20101224231448.000|TR0|
20101224231448.000|20101224231451.000|TR0|That's what my brain wants to do, because 
20101224231451.000|20101224231454.000|TR0|that's the condition that it's in.  So, I 
20101224231454.000|20101224231456.000|TR0|don't fool myself.  I take advantage of 
20101224231456.000|20101224231459.000|TR0|the time when I'm medicated.  And I look 
20101224231459.000|20101224231502.000|TR0|at it as a gift and as an opportunity to 
20101224231502.000|20101224231505.000|TR0|make that time even wider by finding a 
20101224231505.000|20101224231507.000|TR0|more substantial treatment or cure.

20101224231510.000|20101224231513.000|TR0|With some people with Parkinson's, there's 
20101224231513.000|20101224231515.000|TR0|a cognitive element. And I sometimes get 
20101224231515.000|20101224231518.000|TR0|concerned about that when I have recall 
20101224231518.000|20101224231521.000|TR0|issues and stuff like that.  My wife is 
20101224231521.000|20101224231523.000|TR0|quick to tell me I'm almost 50 years old, 
20101224231523.000|20101224231526.000|TR0|and that's why.
20101224231526.000|20101224231529.000|TR0|
20101224231529.000|20101224231532.000|TR0|GUPTA:  This may sound like a silly 
20101224231532.000|20101224231534.000|TR0|question, but are they sure you have 
20101224231534.000|20101224231537.000|TR0|Parkinson's?
20101224231537.000|20101224231540.000|TR0|
20101224231540.000|20101224231542.000|TR0|FOX:  I mean, yes, to an extent.  But 
20101224231542.000|20101224231545.000|TR0|Parkinson's is this umbrella.
20101224231545.000|20101224231548.000|TR0|
20101224231548.000|20101224231550.000|TR0|Parkinson isn't -- in many ways, I have 
20101224231550.000|20101224231553.000|TR0|textbook Parkinson's.  In other ways, I 
20101224231553.000|20101224231556.000|TR0|have idiosyncratic aspects to my 
20101224231556.000|20101224231559.000|TR0|experience.  For example, I'm still 
20101224231559.000|20101224231601.000|TR0|tremendously sensitive to L-dopa.  And, 
20101224231601.000|20101224231604.000|TR0|over time, with a lot of patients, its 
20101224231604.000|20101224231607.000|TR0|efficacy wears off.  It doesn't -- it 
20101224231607.000|20101224231609.000|TR0|isn't as...
20101224231609.000|20101224231612.000|TR0|
20101224231612.000|20101224231615.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You get a tolerance to it?
20101224231615.000|20101224231617.000|TR0|
20101224231617.000|20101224231620.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes, and also it comes with terrible 
20101224231620.000|20101224231623.000|TR0|dyskinesia, which I do experience, but not 
20101224231623.000|20101224231625.000|TR0|to the extent that I could.     But you 
20101224231625.000|20101224231628.000|TR0|experience what you experience.  You can't 
20101224231628.000|20101224231631.000|TR0|push it out to fill a box that someone 
20101224231631.000|20101224231634.000|TR0|else has created for it.  And you can't 
20101224231634.000|20101224231636.000|TR0|shrink it to squeeze into a parenthetic 
20101224231636.000|20101224231639.000|TR0|notation that someone's made about it.  
20101224231639.000|20101224231642.000|TR0|It's your experience.
20101224231642.000|20101224231644.000|TR0|
20101224231644.000|20101224231647.000|TR0|It's -- I'm pretty sure that I have 
20101224231647.000|20101224231650.000|TR0|Parkinson's.  But what is Parkinson's?
20101224231650.000|20101224231652.000|TR0|
20101224231652.000|20101224231655.000|TR0|GUPTA:  And the medication is a precursor 
20101224231655.000|20101224231658.000|TR0|to dopamine, which is the neurotransmitter 
20101224231658.000|20101224231701.000|TR0|that is in short supply in that particular 
20101224231701.000|20101224231703.000|TR0|area of your brain.
20101224231703.000|20101224231706.000|TR0|
20101224231706.000|20101224231709.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes.
20101224231709.000|20101224231711.000|TR0|
20101224231711.000|20101224231714.000|TR0|GUPTA:  So, you're taking this pill.
20101224231714.000|20101224231717.000|TR0|
20101224231717.000|20101224231719.000|TR0|FOX:  Right.
20101224231719.000|20101224231722.000|TR0|
20101224231722.000|20101224231725.000|TR0|There's a lot of titrating.  There's a lot 
20101224231725.000|20101224231728.000|TR0|of -- there's no set -- it isn't like, for 
20101224231728.000|20101224231730.000|TR0|me, where I wake in the morning and I take 
20101224231730.000|20101224231733.000|TR0|two pills, and at 10:00, a bell goes off 
20101224231733.000|20101224231736.000|TR0|and I take two pills, and at 12:00, a bell 
20101224231736.000|20101224231738.000|TR0|goes off and I take two pills.
20101224231738.000|20101224231741.000|TR0|
20101224231741.000|20101224231744.000|TR0|It's constant feeling out, titrating.  And 
20101224231744.000|20101224231746.000|TR0|sometimes I will take a half-a-pill.  
20101224231746.000|20101224231749.000|TR0|Sometimes, I will take a 
20101224231749.000|20101224231752.000|TR0|quarter-of-a-pill.  It all depends on what 
20101224231752.000|20101224231754.000|TR0|kind of cocktail I have brewing in my 
20101224231754.000|20101224231757.000|TR0|brain that day.

20101224231805.000|20101224231808.000|TR0|GUPTA:  He explained to me that sometimes 
20101224231808.000|20101224231811.000|TR0|his mind may want to do one thing, but his 
20101224231811.000|20101224231813.000|TR0|brain sort of takes control, causing many 
20101224231813.000|20101224231816.000|TR0|of the symptoms you just heard him talk 
20101224231816.000|20101224231819.000|TR0|about.
20101224231819.000|20101224231821.000|TR0|
20101224231821.000|20101224231824.000|TR0|Now, medically speaking, Parkinson's 
20101224231824.000|20101224231827.000|TR0|disease is actually pretty 
20101224231827.000|20101224231830.000|TR0|straightforward, when you think about it.  
20101224231830.000|20101224231832.000|TR0|What you have is a particular part of the 
20101224231832.000|20101224231835.000|TR0|brain that produces a chemical known as 
20101224231835.000|20101224231838.000|TR0|dopamine.  It helps us with motor skills 
20101224231838.000|20101224231840.000|TR0|specifically, smooth muscle movements.
20101224231840.000|20101224231843.000|TR0|
20101224231843.000|20101224231846.000|TR0|But the brain of someone with Parkinson's 
20101224231846.000|20101224231848.000|TR0|disease is not producing enough dopamine.  
20101224231848.000|20101224231851.000|TR0|Now, why that happens exactly is anyone's 
20101224231851.000|20101224231854.000|TR0|guess.  But the disease does get 
20101224231854.000|20101224231857.000|TR0|progressively worse.  And, as things stand 
20101224231857.000|20101224231859.000|TR0|right now, doctors can only treat the 
20101224231859.000|20101224231902.000|TR0|symptoms, typically, with a pill that 
20101224231902.000|20101224231905.000|TR0|looks like this.
20101224231905.000|20101224231907.000|TR0|
20101224231907.000|20101224231910.000|TR0|It's calls levodopa.  And it's the single 
20101224231910.000|20101224231913.000|TR0|most effective treatment to control 
20101224231913.000|20101224231915.000|TR0|symptoms.  Let me give you a little bit of 
20101224231915.000|20101224231918.000|TR0|an idea of just exactly how this works.
20101224231918.000|20101224231921.000|TR0|
20101224231921.000|20101224231923.000|TR0|Now, what you have here is the pill going 
20101224231923.000|20101224231926.000|TR0|into the bloodstream, and, subsequently, 
20101224231926.000|20101224231929.000|TR0|it goes to the brain, where it's converted 
20101224231929.000|20101224231932.000|TR0|into dopamine.  But here's the problem.  
20101224231932.000|20101224231934.000|TR0|When the pill starts to wear off, the 
20101224231934.000|20101224231937.000|TR0|symptoms come back.  Sometimes, they're 
20101224231937.000|20101224231940.000|TR0|even worse.  And that all continues until 
20101224231940.000|20101224231942.000|TR0|the next pill is taken.
20101224231942.000|20101224231945.000|TR0|
20101224231945.000|20101224231948.000|TR0|Eventually, you can develop a tolerance to 
20101224231948.000|20101224231950.000|TR0|this medication as well, though there is 
20101224231950.000|20101224231953.000|TR0|some help -- some progress really in 
20101224231953.000|20101224231956.000|TR0|trying to minimize that.  It's sort of -- 
20101224231956.000|20101224231959.000|TR0|think of it like sort of a gel version of 
20101224231959.000|20101224232001.000|TR0|this particular medication.
20101224232001.000|20101224232004.000|TR0|
20101224232004.000|20101224232007.000|TR0|It's called Duodopa.  And what happens is, 
20101224232007.000|20101224232009.000|TR0|the drug gets released via a tube directly 
20101224232009.000|20101224232012.000|TR0|into the small intestine.  And patients 
20101224232012.000|20101224232015.000|TR0|can monitor their levels, must in the same 
20101224232015.000|20101224232017.000|TR0|way that a diabetic does with insulin, and 
20101224232017.000|20101224232020.000|TR0|be alerted before the symptoms get too 
20101224232020.000|20101224232023.000|TR0|severe.
20101224232023.000|20101224232026.000|TR0|
20101224232026.000|20101224232028.000|TR0|Now, this is currently in the clinical 
20101224232028.000|20101224232031.000|TR0|trial stage for approval in the United 
20101224232031.000|20101224232034.000|TR0|States, but already approved for use in 34 
20101224232034.000|20101224232036.000|TR0|other countries.
20101224232036.000|20101224232039.000|TR0|
20101224232039.000|20101224232042.000|TR0|Surgery is also an option for patients not 
20101224232042.000|20101224232044.000|TR0|responding well to medication.  And the 
20101224232044.000|20101224232047.000|TR0|most common nowadays is something known as 
20101224232047.000|20101224232050.000|TR0|deep brain stimulation.  And I want to 
20101224232050.000|20101224232052.000|TR0|give you just a little bit of an idea of 
20101224232052.000|20101224232055.000|TR0|how this works.

20101224232119.000|20101224232122.000|TR0|Now, Michael J. Fox had an operation back 
20101224232122.000|20101224232125.000|TR0|in 1998.  During his operation, which was 
20101224232125.000|20101224232128.000|TR0|called a thalamotomy, Michael was actually 
20101224232128.000|20101224232130.000|TR0|awake. He was actually talking to his 
20101224232130.000|20101224232133.000|TR0|surgeon.

20101224232141.000|20101224232144.000|TR0|FOX:  So, he said, make my -- make your 
20101224232144.000|20101224232146.000|TR0|hand shake.  And I tried to do and I 
20101224232146.000|20101224232149.000|TR0|couldn't.  And I felt this disappointment 
20101224232149.000|20101224232152.000|TR0|that I couldn't give him what he wanted.  
20101224232152.000|20101224232155.000|TR0|Then, of course -- and I said, I can't.  
20101224232155.000|20101224232157.000|TR0|And he said, we're done.
20101224232157.000|20101224232200.000|TR0|
20101224232200.000|20101224232203.000|TR0|And I was like, wow.
20101224232203.000|20101224232205.000|TR0|
20101224232205.000|20101224232208.000|TR0|GUPTA:  The operation was over because 
20101224232208.000|20101224232211.000|TR0|they accomplished the goal.
20101224232211.000|20101224232213.000|TR0|
20101224232213.000|20101224232216.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes, they accomplished the goal, 
20101224232216.000|20101224232219.000|TR0|which was really (INAUDIBLE) for me.  So, 
20101224232219.000|20101224232221.000|TR0|it was just about cessation.
20101224232221.000|20101224232224.000|TR0|
20101224232224.000|20101224232227.000|TR0|And I had a big tremor on my left side, 
20101224232227.000|20101224232230.000|TR0|fully on my left side, and nothing on my 
20101224232230.000|20101224232232.000|TR0|right.  And so my whole life, working and 
20101224232232.000|20101224232235.000|TR0|stuff was about manipulating 
20101224232235.000|20101224232238.000|TR0|circumstances, so that I could pin that 
20101224232238.000|20101224232240.000|TR0|arm.

20101224232248.000|20101224232251.000|TR0|FOX:  Put my hand in your pocket or busy 
20101224232251.000|20101224232254.000|TR0|it or something, because that helped.
20101224232254.000|20101224232257.000|TR0|
20101224232257.000|20101224232259.000|TR0|And -- but it just got too much.  So, 
20101224232259.000|20101224232302.000|TR0|that's when I had the brain surgery.  And 
20101224232302.000|20101224232305.000|TR0|then, of course, I had brain surgery, and 
20101224232305.000|20101224232307.000|TR0|it diminished the effects on my left side, 
20101224232307.000|20101224232310.000|TR0|but just true to the progression of the 
20101224232310.000|20101224232313.000|TR0|disease, within a few months, my right 
20101224232313.000|20101224232315.000|TR0|side started.  So, and I made the decision 
20101224232315.000|20101224232318.000|TR0|not to have another brain surgery.  But... 
20101224232318.000|20101224232321.000|TR0|    GUPTA:  I don't want to belabor the 
20101224232321.000|20101224232324.000|TR0|point, but if they said to you, look, it's 
20101224232324.000|20101224232326.000|TR0|not curative, but with stimulation, we can 
20101224232326.000|20101224232329.000|TR0|dial it up, dial it down with magnets and 
20101224232329.000|20101224232332.000|TR0|possibly really alleviate some of your

20101224232348.000|20101224232350.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Michael J. Fox had surgery 12 
20101224232350.000|20101224232353.000|TR0|years ago on the right side of his brain, 
20101224232353.000|20101224232356.000|TR0|which controls the left side of his body.  
20101224232356.000|20101224232359.000|TR0|The problem was the right side of his body 
20101224232359.000|20101224232401.000|TR0|slowly became worse after that.  And it's 
20101224232401.000|20101224232404.000|TR0|progressed over the years.

20101224232503.000|20101224232506.000|TR0|I want it to -- if there's something that

20101224232517.000|20101224232519.000|TR0|a pacemaker, which is what they have now 
20101224232519.000|20101224232522.000|TR0|-- that's just my personal preference.

20101224232528.000|20101224232530.000|TR0|lives.  There are hundreds of people I 
20101224232530.000|20101224232533.000|TR0|have met, and certainly thousands have had

20101224232536.000|20101224232538.000|TR0|it's been, you know, huge, the 
20101224232538.000|20101224232541.000|TR0|improvement.  People that couldn't walk, 
20101224232541.000|20101224232544.000|TR0|people that had a hard time functioning, 
20101224232544.000|20101224232546.000|TR0|all of a sudden, have fluidity of

20101224232600.000|20101224232603.000|TR0|things, what is the -- is there an overall

20101224232608.000|20101224232611.000|TR0| Or are they saying, look, at some point, 
20101224232611.000|20101224232613.000|TR0|you know, we have got to take a next big

20101224232622.000|20101224232624.000|TR0|FOX:  It's about getting -- being

20101224232627.000|20101224232630.000|TR0|functional on a day-to-day basis.  And

20101224232643.000|20101224232646.000|TR0|again, I'm weighing that.  I tend to lean

20101224232801.000|20101224232804.000|TR0|happy with what I'm able to do and what 
20101224232804.000|20101224232807.000|TR0|I'm able to accomplish.  It's not ideal, 
20101224232807.000|20101224232809.000|TR0|but it certainly beats a lot of other

20101224232823.000|20101224232826.000|TR0|people, including Michael, were hopeful 
20101224232826.000|20101224232828.000|TR0|that stem cells were going to be one of

20101224232858.000|20101224232901.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Ten years ago, Michael J. Fox 
20101224232901.000|20101224232903.000|TR0|started the foundation that now has his 
20101224232903.000|20101224232906.000|TR0|name to find a cure for Parkinson's.  The 
20101224232906.000|20101224232909.000|TR0|foundation is now embarking on a major 
20101224232909.000|20101224232911.000|TR0|research project.  They're looking for 
20101224232911.000|20101224232914.000|TR0|biomarkers for Parkinson's.

20101224232922.000|20101224232925.000|TR0|GUPTA:  It's interesting, because a 
20101224232925.000|20101224232928.000|TR0|biomarker is some sort of signal that the 
20101224232928.000|20101224232930.000|TR0|disease gives off, whether it's a protein 
20101224232930.000|20101224232933.000|TR0|or something in the body.  It can serve a 
20101224232933.000|20101224232936.000|TR0|few different purposes.
20101224232936.000|20101224232938.000|TR0|
20101224232938.000|20101224232941.000|TR0|Perhaps, like in the case of Alzheimer's, 
20101224232941.000|20101224232944.000|TR0|it can give some early clue that someone 
20101224232944.000|20101224232946.000|TR0|either has the disease, maybe doesn't have 
20101224232946.000|20101224232949.000|TR0|symptoms yet, or is going to develop the 
20101224232949.000|20101224232952.000|TR0|disease.  But it may give you some more 
20101224232952.000|20101224232955.000|TR0|insight into the disease itself.
20101224232955.000|20101224232957.000|TR0|
20101224232957.000|20101224233000.000|TR0|(CROSSTALK)      FOX:  It gives you a 
20101224233000.000|20101224233003.000|TR0|starting point.
20101224233003.000|20101224233005.000|TR0|
20101224233005.000|20101224233008.000|TR0|If you want to track the progression of a 
20101224233008.000|20101224233011.000|TR0|disease in a patient, now you have to wait 
20101224233011.000|20101224233013.000|TR0|until he's symptomatic.  But if you have a 
20101224233013.000|20101224233016.000|TR0|biomarker, you can track that from its 
20101224233016.000|20101224233019.000|TR0|earliest stages.  You can say, what is 
20101224233019.000|20101224233022.000|TR0|going to be the trigger here that's going 
20101224233022.000|20101224233024.000|TR0|to -- not only the trigger that's going to 
20101224233024.000|20101224233027.000|TR0|eradicate symptoms or halt progression, 
20101224233027.000|20101224233030.000|TR0|but what's the trigger that caused it to 
20101224233030.000|20101224233032.000|TR0|start?
20101224233032.000|20101224233035.000|TR0|
20101224233035.000|20101224233038.000|TR0|If we have -- you know, it's often said 
20101224233038.000|20101224233040.000|TR0|that, with Parkinson's, genetics loads the 
20101224233040.000|20101224233043.000|TR0|gun and environment pulls the trigger.  
20101224233043.000|20101224233046.000|TR0|There's something -- why has no one in my 
20101224233046.000|20101224233049.000|TR0|family never had Parkinson's?  It's not 
20101224233049.000|20101224233051.000|TR0|necessarily that we don't all have the 
20101224233051.000|20101224233054.000|TR0|genetic risk.  It's that I ran into 
20101224233054.000|20101224233057.000|TR0|whatever that trigger was.  And these are 
20101224233057.000|20101224233059.000|TR0|the things we want to learn about.
20101224233059.000|20101224233102.000|TR0|
20101224233102.000|20101224233105.000|TR0|GUPTA:  When they talk about some of the 
20101224233105.000|20101224233107.000|TR0|most potentially effective therapies -- 
20101224233107.000|20101224233110.000|TR0|and you have talked a lot about this -- 
20101224233110.000|20101224233113.000|TR0|stem cells is something that still comes 
20101224233113.000|20101224233115.000|TR0|up.  Why don't you talk about stem cells 
20101224233115.000|20101224233118.000|TR0|as much anymore?
20101224233118.000|20101224233121.000|TR0|
20101224233121.000|20101224233124.000|TR0|FOX:  Well, it was an urgency of the 
20101224233124.000|20101224233126.000|TR0|moment, with that vote coming up in 2006.
20101224233126.000|20101224233129.000|TR0|
20101224233129.000|20101224233132.000|TR0|I mean, the simple fact is that patients 
20101224233132.000|20101224233134.000|TR0|have the right to insist that federal 
20101224233134.000|20101224233137.000|TR0|funders and industry pursue anything 
20101224233137.000|20101224233140.000|TR0|that's likely to find an answer, to find a 
20101224233140.000|20101224233142.000|TR0|cure.
20101224233142.000|20101224233145.000|TR0|
20101224233145.000|20101224233148.000|TR0|There are ethical questions.  We went 
20101224233148.000|20101224233151.000|TR0|through them.  We went through them for 
20101224233151.000|20101224233153.000|TR0|every side.  Reasonable people disagreed.  
20101224233153.000|20101224233156.000|TR0|I happen to think that, in the case of 
20101224233156.000|20101224233159.000|TR0|eggs, embryos left over from in vitro 
20101224233159.000|20101224233201.000|TR0|fertilization, that they were going to be 
20101224233201.000|20101224233204.000|TR0|destroyed anyway.  Why not help?
20101224233204.000|20101224233207.000|TR0|
20101224233207.000|20101224233209.000|TR0|But that's another issue.  I think that -- 
20101224233209.000|20101224233212.000|TR0|I think that just the basic idea of stem 
20101224233212.000|20101224233215.000|TR0|cell science, it's part of our portfolio.  
20101224233215.000|20101224233218.000|TR0|It's part of things we pursue, but it's by 
20101224233218.000|20101224233220.000|TR0|no means the majority of the avenues that 
20101224233220.000|20101224233223.000|TR0|we're going down now.
20101224233223.000|20101224233226.000|TR0|
20101224233226.000|20101224233228.000|TR0|But to shut off any possible inroad to a 
20101224233228.000|20101224233231.000|TR0|cure or a breakthrough just seemed to me 
20101224233231.000|20101224233234.000|TR0|to make no sense, and especially when 
20101224233234.000|20101224233236.000|TR0|attached to a political agenda.

20101224233239.000|20101224233242.000|TR0|GUPTA:  How important is Michael J. Fox to 
20101224233242.000|20101224233244.000|TR0|this?  How important are you to this 
20101224233244.000|20101224233247.000|TR0|mission?
20101224233247.000|20101224233250.000|TR0|
20101224233250.000|20101224233253.000|TR0|FOX:  Well, I think, me, personally, I 
20101224233253.000|20101224233255.000|TR0|think I serve as head cheerleader.  And 
20101224233255.000|20101224233258.000|TR0|perhaps I put a face on it for people that 
20101224233258.000|20101224233301.000|TR0|are experiencing it.
20101224233301.000|20101224233303.000|TR0|
20101224233303.000|20101224233306.000|TR0|I don't want to underestimate that, 
20101224233306.000|20101224233309.000|TR0|because I know, when I first disclosed 
20101224233309.000|20101224233311.000|TR0|that I was dealing with this, I got an 
20101224233311.000|20101224233314.000|TR0|e-mail from a lady who was going into this 
20101224233314.000|20101224233317.000|TR0|local store.  And she just assumed that 
20101224233317.000|20101224233320.000|TR0|the person behind the counter thought she 
20101224233320.000|20101224233322.000|TR0|was drunk, because she had erratic 
20101224233322.000|20101224233325.000|TR0|movements.  And he kind of dealt with her 
20101224233325.000|20101224233328.000|TR0|brusquely.
20101224233328.000|20101224233330.000|TR0|
20101224233330.000|20101224233333.000|TR0|And then she went in after I had kind of 
20101224233333.000|20101224233336.000|TR0|disclosed, and he was looking at her.  And 
20101224233336.000|20101224233338.000|TR0|she said, I have Parkinson's.
20101224233338.000|20101224233341.000|TR0|
20101224233341.000|20101224233344.000|TR0|And he said, oh, like Michael Fox.
20101224233344.000|20101224233347.000|TR0|
20101224233347.000|20101224233349.000|TR0|So, I mean, that -- and that really 
20101224233349.000|20101224233352.000|TR0|touched me, I mean, because the -- talking 
20101224233352.000|20101224233355.000|TR0|about the patient experience, it can be a 
20101224233355.000|20101224233357.000|TR0|very lonely experience.  And, so, if you 
20101224233357.000|20101224233400.000|TR0|feel like there's somebody who's getting 
20101224233400.000|20101224233403.000|TR0|up in the morning and is on it -- you 
20101224233403.000|20101224233405.000|TR0|know, because cures don't fall out of the 
20101224233405.000|20101224233408.000|TR0|sky.
20101224233408.000|20101224233411.000|TR0|
20101224233411.000|20101224233413.000|TR0|They don't -- we have to go up and get 
20101224233413.000|20101224233416.000|TR0|them.  And we just assume -- like, I think 
20101224233416.000|20101224233419.000|TR0|I always assumed there was a department of 
20101224233419.000|20101224233422.000|TR0|cures, that there was a minister of cures, 
20101224233422.000|20101224233424.000|TR0|a secretary of cures.  But there isn't.  
20101224233424.000|20101224233427.000|TR0|It's us.

20101224233502.000|20101224233505.000|TR0|Parkinson's disease.  Dr. Walter 
20101224233505.000|20101224233507.000|TR0|Koroshetz, he's deputy director of the 
20101224233507.000|20101224233510.000|TR0|National Institute of Neurological 
20101224233510.000|20101224233513.000|TR0|Disorders and Stroke, and Dr. Bernard 
20101224233513.000|20101224233516.000|TR0|Ravina, associate chief of neurology at 
20101224233516.000|20101224233518.000|TR0|the University of Rochester.  He's also a 
20101224233518.000|20101224233521.000|TR0|researcher with the Michael J. Fox 
20101224233521.000|20101224233524.000|TR0|Foundation.  Thanks for joining us.
20101224233524.000|20101224233526.000|TR0|
20101224233526.000|20101224233529.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.
20101224233529.000|20101224233532.000|TR0|
20101224233532.000|20101224233534.000|TR0|UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.
20101224233534.000|20101224233537.000|TR0|
20101224233537.000|20101224233540.000|TR0|GUPTA:  He's doing so well.  You know, he 
20101224233540.000|20101224233542.000|TR0|really had a lot to say obviously.  But he 
20101224233542.000|20101224233545.000|TR0|did point as well that there are so many 
20101224233545.000|20101224233548.000|TR0|unknowns. We don't know what causes this.  
20101224233548.000|20101224233551.000|TR0|The treatment for this hasn't changed a 
20101224233551.000|20101224233553.000|TR0|lot the last several years and at one 
20101224233553.000|20101224233556.000|TR0|point he says, you know, just diagnosing 
20101224233556.000|20101224233559.000|TR0|him at such a young age, they weren't even 
20101224233559.000|20101224233601.000|TR0|sure he had Parkinson's disease.  Dr. 
20101224233601.000|20101224233604.000|TR0|Ravina, is that part of the reason that 
20101224233604.000|20101224233607.000|TR0|makes it so difficult to make progress 
20101224233607.000|20101224233609.000|TR0|here?
20101224233609.000|20101224233612.000|TR0|
20101224233612.000|20101224233615.000|TR0|DR. BERNARD RAVINA, ASSOC. CHIEF OF 
20101224233615.000|20101224233618.000|TR0|NEUROLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER:  It's 
20101224233618.000|20101224233620.000|TR0|true.  There are multiple factors that may 
20101224233620.000|20101224233623.000|TR0|contribute to causing Parkinson's disease, 
20101224233623.000|20101224233626.000|TR0|and certainly in people who have early 
20101224233626.000|20101224233628.000|TR0|onset or young onset Parkinson's disease, 
20101224233628.000|20101224233631.000|TR0|it can be much more difficult to make a 
20101224233631.000|20101224233634.000|TR0|diagnosis because there are several other 
20101224233634.000|20101224233636.000|TR0|diseases that may be suspected or that you 
20101224233636.000|20101224233639.000|TR0|need to rule out first.
20101224233639.000|20101224233642.000|TR0|
20101224233642.000|20101224233645.000|TR0|GUPTA:  He has the disease.  I guess there 
20101224233645.000|20101224233647.000|TR0|are other things that can sort of mimic 
20101224233647.000|20101224233650.000|TR0|it, especially when he has diagnosed.  Had 
20101224233650.000|20101224233653.000|TR0|symptoms at 29.  Was diagnosed at 30.  Are 
20101224233653.000|20101224233655.000|TR0|there other things that this could be?
20101224233655.000|20101224233658.000|TR0|
20101224233658.000|20101224233701.000|TR0|DR. WALTER KOROSHETZ, NATIONAL INSTITUTE 
20101224233701.000|20101224233703.000|TR0|OF NEUROLOGIAL DISORDERS  &  STROKE:  
20101224233703.000|20101224233706.000|TR0|Well, I think there are a number of 
20101224233706.000|20101224233709.000|TR0|disorders that cause degeneration in the 
20101224233709.000|20101224233711.000|TR0|same brain areas, and they produce a very 
20101224233711.000|20101224233714.000|TR0|similar phenotype.  The distinguishing 
20101224233714.000|20101224233717.000|TR0|features to Parkinson's disease, I think 
20101224233717.000|20101224233720.000|TR0|the one that is the most distinguishing is 
20101224233720.000|20101224233722.000|TR0|that the patients respond to the 
20101224233722.000|20101224233725.000|TR0|medications in the early stages, where 
20101224233725.000|20101224233728.000|TR0|many of the other diseases are not 
20101224233728.000|20101224233730.000|TR0|responsive.  So this ability to respond to 
20101224233730.000|20101224233733.000|TR0|dopamine agonist is usually the cut point 
20101224233733.000|20101224233736.000|TR0|that makes you feel certain that someone 
20101224233736.000|20101224233738.000|TR0|has Parkinson's.
20101224233738.000|20101224233741.000|TR0|
20101224233741.000|20101224233744.000|TR0|GUPTA:  And he says he clearly responds to 
20101224233744.000|20101224233747.000|TR0|it, he clearly has benefit from taking the 
20101224233747.000|20101224233749.000|TR0|dopamine which is what is deficient in the 
20101224233749.000|20101224233752.000|TR0|brain in some of the Parkinson's.
20101224233752.000|20101224233755.000|TR0|
20101224233755.000|20101224233757.000|TR0|KOROSHETZ:  Correct.
20101224233757.000|20101224233800.000|TR0|
20101224233800.000|20101224233803.000|TR0|GUPTA:  He talked a fair amount and 
20101224233803.000|20101224233805.000|TR0|obviously the foundation very interested 
20101224233805.000|20101224233808.000|TR0|in biomarkers.  First of all, tell us a 
20101224233808.000|20101224233811.000|TR0|little about what biomarkers are and why 
20101224233811.000|20101224233814.000|TR0|is it so important as we move forward?
20101224233814.000|20101224233816.000|TR0|
20101224233816.000|20101224233819.000|TR0|RAVINA:  Sure.  Well, biomarkers are a 
20101224233819.000|20101224233822.000|TR0|characteristic or something that can 
20101224233822.000|20101224233824.000|TR0|measure that tells you about the 
20101224233824.000|20101224233827.000|TR0|underlying disease process.  So not the 
20101224233827.000|20101224233830.000|TR0|symptoms, but what's causing the symptoms. 
20101224233830.000|20101224233832.000|TR0| A good example is being able to measure 
20101224233832.000|20101224233835.000|TR0|blood sugar in diabetes.  It helps you 
20101224233835.000|20101224233838.000|TR0|make the diagnosis and it also helps 
20101224233838.000|20101224233840.000|TR0|figure out if people are responding to the 
20101224233840.000|20101224233843.000|TR0|treatment.
20101224233843.000|20101224233846.000|TR0|
20101224233846.000|20101224233849.000|TR0|In Parkinson's disease, we really don't 
20101224233849.000|20101224233851.000|TR0|have biomarkers that tell us what the 
20101224233851.000|20101224233854.000|TR0|underlying disease is doing in the brain.  
20101224233854.000|20101224233857.000|TR0|And it's a little bit more challenging 
20101224233857.000|20101224233859.000|TR0|because the measures that we're interested 
20101224233859.000|20101224233902.000|TR0|in are in the brain.  So it's not 
20101224233902.000|20101224233905.000|TR0|necessarily quite as simple as getting a 
20101224233905.000|20101224233907.000|TR0|blood test.
20101224233907.000|20101224233910.000|TR0|
20101224233910.000|20101224233913.000|TR0|GUPTA:  So there's something that might be 
20101224233913.000|20101224233916.000|TR0|that you can measure that tells you that 
20101224233916.000|20101224233918.000|TR0|someone, first of all, has Parkinson's, 
20101224233918.000|20101224233921.000|TR0|and a specific target for a medication as 
20101224233921.000|20101224233924.000|TR0|well?
20101224233924.000|20101224233926.000|TR0|
20101224233926.000|20101224233929.000|TR0|KOROSHETZ:  Right.  Well, I think that's 
20101224233929.000|20101224233932.000|TR0|really the key.  In my mind, the biomarker 
20101224233932.000|20101224233934.000|TR0|significance is a measure that you can 
20101224233934.000|20101224233937.000|TR0|target with a drug or therapy that 
20101224233937.000|20101224233940.000|TR0|increases the probability that you're 
20101224233940.000|20101224233943.000|TR0|going to respond to that therapy.
20101224233943.000|20101224233945.000|TR0|
20101224233945.000|20101224233948.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Five-year study, $40 million, 
20101224233948.000|20101224233951.000|TR0|several countries around the world?
20101224233951.000|20101224233953.000|TR0|
20101224233953.000|20101224233956.000|TR0|RAVINA:  That's right.  This is one of the 
20101224233956.000|20101224233959.000|TR0|first large-scale international efforts to 
20101224233959.000|20101224234001.000|TR0|develop biomarkers that will tell us about 
20101224234001.000|20101224234004.000|TR0|the progression of Parkinson's.
20101224234004.000|20101224234007.000|TR0|
20101224234007.000|20101224234009.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Right.
20101224234009.000|20101224234012.000|TR0|
20101224234012.000|20101224234015.000|TR0|RAVINA:  And as Walter was saying, exactly 
20101224234015.000|20101224234018.000|TR0|the point, the goal here is to be able to 
20101224234018.000|20101224234020.000|TR0|use these biomarkers to help develop drugs 
20101224234020.000|20101224234023.000|TR0|that will slow the progression.  So if we 
20101224234023.000|20101224234026.000|TR0|can use them to get a read --
20101224234026.000|20101224234028.000|TR0|
20101224234028.000|20101224234031.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Right.
20101224234031.000|20101224234034.000|TR0|
20101224234034.000|20101224234036.000|TR0|RAVINA:  -- on whether or not the drugs 
20101224234036.000|20101224234039.000|TR0|are really hitting that process, we can 
20101224234039.000|20101224234042.000|TR0|really move that process along more 
20101224234042.000|20101224234045.000|TR0|quickly.     GUPTA:  A couple of things, 
20101224234045.000|20101224234047.000|TR0|we only have a little bit of time left.  
20101224234047.000|20101224234050.000|TR0|But stem cells was something that Michael 
20101224234050.000|20101224234053.000|TR0|J.  Fox used to talk a lot about.  He 
20101224234053.000|20101224234055.000|TR0|doesn't talk as much about it.  Why not?  
20101224234055.000|20101224234058.000|TR0|Is there less promise?  There was a lot of 
20101224234058.000|20101224234101.000|TR0|enthusiasm, Dr. Ravina.
20101224234101.000|20101224234103.000|TR0|
20101224234103.000|20101224234106.000|TR0|RAVINA:  I don't know that there's less 
20101224234106.000|20101224234109.000|TR0|promise.  Certainly it's a controversial 
20101224234109.000|20101224234112.000|TR0|issue.  But what I think what's key in 
20101224234112.000|20101224234114.000|TR0|Parkinson's is that we pursue multiple 
20101224234114.000|20101224234117.000|TR0|different avenues to treatments.  Stem 
20101224234117.000|20101224234120.000|TR0|cells may work, but there are also other 
20101224234120.000|20101224234122.000|TR0|ways that we can go about addressing the 
20101224234122.000|20101224234125.000|TR0|progression.
20101224234125.000|20101224234128.000|TR0|
20101224234128.000|20101224234130.000|TR0|KOROSHETZ:  I think the key thing to know 
20101224234130.000|20101224234133.000|TR0|is that the genetics has really opened the 
20101224234133.000|20101224234136.000|TR0|door because it isolated a defect in a 
20101224234136.000|20101224234138.000|TR0|protein called synuclein in a particular 
20101224234138.000|20101224234141.000|TR0|family that got Parkinson's.  And that 
20101224234141.000|20101224234144.000|TR0|opened the door because what we found 
20101224234144.000|20101224234147.000|TR0|after that was that everyone with 
20101224234147.000|20101224234149.000|TR0|Parkinson's has this synuclein problem.  
20101224234149.000|20101224234152.000|TR0|And it occurs in the brain and in the

20101224234155.000|20101224234157.000|TR0|So now, we know kind of what we might be 
20101224234157.000|20101224234200.000|TR0|able to go after to get the treatment.

20101224234208.000|20101224234211.000|TR0|KOROSHETZ:  Correct.

20101224234214.000|20101224234216.000|TR0|GUPTA:  -- gives you a little prediction.  
20101224234216.000|20101224234219.000|TR0|I think we can all agree on this.  I mean, 
20101224234219.000|20101224234222.000|TR0|he is the eternal optimist.

20101224234243.000|20101224234246.000|TR0|optimist.  When we return, he's going to 
20101224234246.000|20101224234249.000|TR0|explain why he also calls Parkinson's 
20101224234249.000|20101224234251.000|TR0|disease a gift.  Stay with us.

20101224234259.000|20101224234302.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Michael J. Fox calls himself an 
20101224234302.000|20101224234305.000|TR0|incurable optimist.  And he called 
20101224234305.000|20101224234307.000|TR0|Parkinson's a gift.  A gift that keeps on 
20101224234307.000|20101224234310.000|TR0|taking, as he put it.  Not surprising.  He 
20101224234310.000|20101224234313.000|TR0|was skeptical when doctors told him the 
20101224234313.000|20101224234316.000|TR0|tremors that began when he was just 29 
20101224234316.000|20101224234318.000|TR0|years old were signs of Parkinson's.  It's 
20101224234318.000|20101224234321.000|TR0|a disease that typically strikes people 
20101224234321.000|20101224234324.000|TR0|after the age of 50.

20101224234332.000|20101224234334.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Did you believe them when they 
20101224234334.000|20101224234337.000|TR0|told you?
20101224234337.000|20101224234340.000|TR0|
20101224234340.000|20101224234343.000|TR0|MICHAEL J. FOX, ACTOR:  No, I thought they 
20101224234343.000|20101224234345.000|TR0|were crazy.  I felt bad for the doctors 
20101224234345.000|20101224234348.000|TR0|afterward because I was -- yes, I was too 
20101224234348.000|20101224234351.000|TR0|funny now, but I was indignant.  I was 
20101224234351.000|20101224234353.000|TR0|like, no, you made a mistake.  Not only 
20101224234353.000|20101224234356.000|TR0|because I was young, but because my life 
20101224234356.000|20101224234359.000|TR0|had been so charmed to that point, that I 
20101224234359.000|20101224234401.000|TR0|thought, this has to be some kind of 
20101224234401.000|20101224234404.000|TR0|error.  But as I pursued second opinions 
20101224234404.000|20101224234407.000|TR0|and third opinions and it became clear 
20101224234407.000|20101224234410.000|TR0|that was the situation.
20101224234410.000|20101224234412.000|TR0|
20101224234412.000|20101224234415.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Do you remember what you told, you 
20101224234415.000|20101224234418.000|TR0|told the doctor?  Was the doctor shocked 
20101224234418.000|20101224234420.000|TR0|that you went to other doctors?  Or what 
20101224234420.000|20101224234423.000|TR0|did he do?
20101224234423.000|20101224234426.000|TR0|
20101224234426.000|20101224234428.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes, I did.  I went -- I saw the 
20101224234428.000|20101224234431.000|TR0|original doctor, the diagnosing doctor.  
20101224234431.000|20101224234434.000|TR0|And then I saw a couple other prominent, 
20101224234434.000|20101224234436.000|TR0|you know, neurologists.  I mean, they 
20101224234436.000|20101224234439.000|TR0|weren't as -- it wasn't the kind of 
20101224234439.000|20101224234442.000|TR0|movement disorder specialty that there is 
20101224234442.000|20101224234445.000|TR0|now.  There's certainly people that 
20101224234445.000|20101224234447.000|TR0|focused on Parkinson's, not in the way 
20101224234447.000|20101224234450.000|TR0|they do now.  But I saw them.  And I 
20101224234450.000|20101224234453.000|TR0|finally ended up with the big (INAUDIBLE). 
20101224234453.000|20101224234455.000|TR0| I won't mention his name but he was quite 
20101224234455.000|20101224234458.000|TR0|an esteemed neurologist.  And he was very 
20101224234458.000|20101224234501.000|TR0|brusque.  He was insistent when I first 
20101224234501.000|20101224234503.000|TR0|came in.  No, you're too young.  No.  And 
20101224234503.000|20101224234506.000|TR0|I thought, oh, this is good.  And this guy 
20101224234506.000|20101224234509.000|TR0|is a little grumpy, but we may get to the 
20101224234509.000|20101224234512.000|TR0|truth here.  And then -- and then sure 
20101224234512.000|20101224234514.000|TR0|enough, he finished his examination and 
20101224234514.000|20101224234517.000|TR0|said, no, you have Parkinson's.
20101224234517.000|20101224234520.000|TR0|
20101224234520.000|20101224234522.000|TR0|GUPTA:  I have so many patients I see in 
20101224234522.000|20101224234525.000|TR0|the office and, you know, sometimes, I 
20101224234525.000|20101224234528.000|TR0|tell them news that's not great.  And one 
20101224234528.000|20101224234530.000|TR0|thing they understandably ask is why me?  
20101224234530.000|20101224234533.000|TR0|And obviously, there's not an answer to 
20101224234533.000|20101224234536.000|TR0|that question.  But did you ever ask 
20101224234536.000|20101224234539.000|TR0|yourself why you were --
20101224234539.000|20101224234541.000|TR0|
20101224234541.000|20101224234544.000|TR0|FOX:  No, I went to, it's not me.  My 
20101224234544.000|20101224234547.000|TR0|first response was, it was a mistake as we 
20101224234547.000|20101224234549.000|TR0|talked about earlier.
20101224234549.000|20101224234552.000|TR0|
20101224234552.000|20101224234555.000|TR0|GUPTA:  The doctors made a mistake.
20101224234555.000|20101224234557.000|TR0|
20101224234557.000|20101224234600.000|TR0|FOX:  No, I didn't -- I didn't get there.  
20101224234600.000|20101224234603.000|TR0|I did go through a long period of kind of 
20101224234603.000|20101224234605.000|TR0|denial about it and hiding it and 
20101224234605.000|20101224234608.000|TR0|wondering what was going to happen.  How 
20101224234608.000|20101224234611.000|TR0|fast it was going to happen.  But there 
20101224234611.000|20101224234614.000|TR0|was a clear period around 1993-'94, two 
20101224234614.000|20101224234616.000|TR0|years after the diagnosis where I just got 
20101224234616.000|20101224234619.000|TR0|it.  I just accepted it.  And I realized 
20101224234619.000|20101224234622.000|TR0|that there's a real saying that my 
20101224234622.000|20101224234624.000|TR0|happiness grows in direct proportion to my 
20101224234624.000|20101224234627.000|TR0|acceptance and in direct proportion to my 
20101224234627.000|20101224234630.000|TR0|expectation.  You know, it's just about 
20101224234630.000|20101224234632.000|TR0|it.  This is what it is.  And so now what?
20101224234632.000|20101224234635.000|TR0|
20101224234635.000|20101224234638.000|TR0|GUPTA:  So once you were not in denial, 
20101224234638.000|20101224234641.000|TR0|you think you were happier?
20101224234641.000|20101224234643.000|TR0|
20101224234643.000|20101224234646.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes, absolutely.  Because when you 
20101224234646.000|20101224234649.000|TR0|can look at the truth of something, then I 
20101224234649.000|20101224234651.000|TR0|mean, that's what it is.  It is what it 
20101224234651.000|20101224234654.000|TR0|is.  Now, you have options.  The only 
20101224234654.000|20101224234657.000|TR0|thing I don't have a choice about is 
20101224234657.000|20101224234659.000|TR0|whether I have Parkinson's.  Everything 
20101224234659.000|20101224234702.000|TR0|else is my choice.  And that's incredibly 
20101224234702.000|20101224234705.000|TR0|liberating.  That's much more liberating 
20101224234705.000|20101224234708.000|TR0|than the physical (INAUDIBLE) of this 
20101224234708.000|20101224234710.000|TR0|disease are limiting.

20101224234713.000|20101224234716.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Are there things that you 
20101224234716.000|20101224234718.000|TR0|particularly miss that you can't do?  I 
20101224234718.000|20101224234721.000|TR0|mean, things that you say, God, I really 
20101224234721.000|20101224234724.000|TR0|just wish I could do this still?
20101224234724.000|20101224234726.000|TR0|
20101224234726.000|20101224234729.000|TR0|FOX:  No.
20101224234729.000|20101224234732.000|TR0|
20101224234732.000|20101224234734.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You did everything.
20101224234734.000|20101224234737.000|TR0|
20101224234737.000|20101224234740.000|TR0|FOX:  I did everything I did before.  Yes, 
20101224234740.000|20101224234743.000|TR0|I know.  I play hockey.  I play golf.  I 
20101224234743.000|20101224234745.000|TR0|play guitar with my kids.  I mean, if it 
20101224234745.000|20101224234748.000|TR0|seriously limited or restricted or 
20101224234748.000|20101224234751.000|TR0|adversely affected my ability to react 
20101224234751.000|20101224234753.000|TR0|with my kids, I think that would be 
20101224234753.000|20101224234756.000|TR0|something that would be hard to deal with.
20101224234756.000|20101224234759.000|TR0|
20101224234759.000|20101224234801.000|TR0|I go back to my reasons for starting this 
20101224234801.000|20101224234804.000|TR0|foundation.  If you -- I use this analogy 
20101224234804.000|20101224234807.000|TR0|a lot but it's really apt.  If you step 
20101224234807.000|20101224234810.000|TR0|off a curb and get hit by a bus, the 
20101224234810.000|20101224234812.000|TR0|impact in your life is immediate and 
20101224234812.000|20101224234815.000|TR0|catastrophic.  And you have no options.  
20101224234815.000|20101224234818.000|TR0|You just -- it's the effect of whatever 
20101224234818.000|20101224234820.000|TR0|happens there.  With Parkinson's, it's 
20101224234820.000|20101224234823.000|TR0|like, you're crossing the road and you get 
20101224234823.000|20101224234826.000|TR0|stuck in the middle.  And you know the bus 
20101224234826.000|20101224234828.000|TR0|is coming.  And you can't get out of the 
20101224234828.000|20101224234831.000|TR0|way.  So you can kind of freak out and you 
20101224234831.000|20101224234834.000|TR0|go, oh, that bus is going to hit me at 
20101224234834.000|20101224234837.000|TR0|some point, even though you don't know how 
20101224234837.000|20101224234839.000|TR0|fast or how big or where.  But you can be 
20101224234839.000|20101224234842.000|TR0|stuck in that result that this bus is

20101224234845.000|20101224234847.000|TR0|you have before the bus gets there to try 
20101224234847.000|20101224234850.000|TR0|to change the route.  And that's what we 
20101224234850.000|20101224234853.000|TR0|try to do.  You know, methodically, but

20101224234941.000|20101224234944.000|TR0|in "Back to the Future" shot 25 years ago. 
20101224234944.000|20101224234947.000|TR0| You can believe it?  There's still no

20101224235000.000|20101224235003.000|TR0|FOX:  You know, vanity goes out the window 
20101224235003.000|20101224235006.000|TR0|very early.  Once you kind of accept this 
20101224235006.000|20101224235008.000|TR0|and you decide to move forward with it and 
20101224235008.000|20101224235011.000|TR0|react positively, you start to realize it 
20101224235011.000|20101224235014.000|TR0|doesn't matter what you look like. It 
20101224235014.000|20101224235016.000|TR0|matters what you can get done, what you 
20101224235016.000|20101224235019.000|TR0|can do.

20101224235022.000|20101224235024.000|TR0|GUPTA:  But the teenage girls all across 
20101224235024.000|20101224235027.000|TR0|the world had your pictures up on their 
20101224235027.000|20101224235030.000|TR0|walls.
20101224235030.000|20101224235032.000|TR0|
20101224235032.000|20101224235035.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes, that's right.  Now I got 
20101224235035.000|20101224235038.000|TR0|teenage daughters with pictures of guys at 
20101224235038.000|20101224235041.000|TR0|their walls.

20101224235043.000|20101224235046.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Vanity goes out the window.  I 
20101224235046.000|20101224235049.000|TR0|mean, what you mean by that is that this 
20101224235049.000|20101224235051.000|TR0|isn't about how you look, it's about 
20101224235051.000|20101224235054.000|TR0|trying to move the mission forward?
20101224235054.000|20101224235057.000|TR0|
20101224235057.000|20101224235059.000|TR0|FOX:  Right, exactly.  And I'm really 
20101224235059.000|20101224235102.000|TR0|excited about it.  I mean, again, with the 
20101224235102.000|20101224235105.000|TR0|foundation, in 10 years we've been able to 
20101224235105.000|20101224235108.000|TR0|fund somewhere near $200 million.     
20101224235108.000|20101224235110.000|TR0|GUPTA:  That's an incredible number, $200 
20101224235110.000|20101224235113.000|TR0|million.  And I've seen the funding 
20101224235113.000|20101224235116.000|TR0|budgets at large organizations including 
20101224235116.000|20101224235118.000|TR0|the National Institutes of Health.  $200 
20101224235118.000|20101224235121.000|TR0|million can get things done.
20101224235121.000|20101224235124.000|TR0|
20101224235124.000|20101224235126.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes, we were definitely having an 
20101224235126.000|20101224235129.000|TR0|impact.  And when I came into this, I 
20101224235129.000|20101224235132.000|TR0|obviously had the pain and lack of 
20101224235132.000|20101224235135.000|TR0|experience in these kinds of things so I 
20101224235135.000|20101224235137.000|TR0|can make broad-sweeping pronouncements 
20101224235137.000|20101224235140.000|TR0|and/or objectives and then kind of go back 
20101224235140.000|20101224235143.000|TR0|and go in and hopefully they'll be carried 
20101224235143.000|20101224235145.000|TR0|out, and they were.  Like, I didn't want 
20101224235145.000|20101224235148.000|TR0|this to be a bank.  I didn't want to start 
20101224235148.000|20101224235151.000|TR0|to have an endowment.  I wanted the money 
20101224235151.000|20101224235153.000|TR0|to come in and go out.  I wanted to speed 
20101224235153.000|20101224235156.000|TR0|up research and have an option for 
20101224235156.000|20101224235159.000|TR0|researchers who were on to something, 
20101224235159.000|20101224235201.000|TR0|whether it was a big question or just a 
20101224235201.000|20101224235204.000|TR0|little question like how to solve the next 
20101224235204.000|20101224235207.000|TR0|bigger question. But get them funding as 
20101224235207.000|20101224235210.000|TR0|quickly as possible.  And we were able to 
20101224235210.000|20101224235212.000|TR0|do that.  And then it expanded into other 
20101224235212.000|20101224235215.000|TR0|new areas of philanthropic research.  And 
20101224235215.000|20101224235218.000|TR0|it's been an amazing experience.

20101224235220.000|20101224235223.000|TR0|GUPTA:  You described your life as being 
20101224235223.000|20101224235226.000|TR0|front-loaded, meaning you accomplished a 
20101224235226.000|20101224235228.000|TR0|lot of things very early in life.  And I 
20101224235228.000|20101224235231.000|TR0|read your books.  You are so optimistic.  
20101224235231.000|20101224235234.000|TR0|And it's not to say that you shouldn't be. 
20101224235234.000|20101224235237.000|TR0| But is there a lesson there for other 
20101224235237.000|20101224235239.000|TR0|people?  What keeps you so optimistic?
20101224235239.000|20101224235242.000|TR0|
20101224235242.000|20101224235245.000|TR0|FOX:  It's like being in the moment.  It's 
20101224235245.000|20101224235247.000|TR0|just like there's no more important moment 
20101224235247.000|20101224235250.000|TR0|than right now.  And I think, you know, I 
20101224235250.000|20101224235253.000|TR0|say to my wife sometimes, if you get 
20101224235253.000|20101224235255.000|TR0|caught up in the worst case scenario and 
20101224235255.000|20101224235258.000|TR0|it doesn't happen, you've wasted your 
20101224235258.000|20101224235301.000|TR0|time.  And if you are caught up in the 
20101224235301.000|20101224235304.000|TR0|worst case scenario and it does happen, 
20101224235304.000|20101224235306.000|TR0|you've lived it twice. You know, there's 
20101224235306.000|20101224235309.000|TR0|no -- to be prepared and to informed and 
20101224235309.000|20101224235312.000|TR0|to know what the future may bring, but 
20101224235312.000|20101224235314.000|TR0|it's also important to celebrate right now

20101224235435.000|20101224235438.000|TR0|tall he was.  And then I said I'm 5'1." 
20101224235438.000|20101224235441.000|TR0|And he said -- 5 foot.  There's a

20101224235449.000|20101224235451.000|TR0|FOX:  It's the same.  I mean, my doctor 
20101224235451.000|20101224235454.000|TR0|says there is no predictable path.  Again, 
20101224235454.000|20101224235457.000|TR0|I could be looking for milestones.  On 
20101224235457.000|20101224235459.000|TR0|some course, that I'm projected to go 
20101224235459.000|20101224235502.000|TR0|down.  I could miss milestones that are 
20101224235502.000|20101224235505.000|TR0|coming on another path.  It really is a 
20101224235505.000|20101224235508.000|TR0|day-to-day thing.  So there's no point 
20101224235508.000|20101224235510.000|TR0|knowing of the journey where you get to a 
20101224235510.000|20101224235513.000|TR0|place that triggers these options -- these 
20101224235513.000|20101224235516.000|TR0|continued disease.  It really isn't like

20101224235543.000|20101224235545.000|TR0|
20101224235545.000|20101224235548.000|TR0|FOX:  Yes.
20101224235548.000|20101224235551.000|TR0|
20101224235551.000|20101224235553.000|TR0|GUPTA:  Always looking up.
20101224235553.000|20101224235556.000|TR0|
20101224235556.000|20101224235559.000|TR0|FOX:  Always looking up, absolutely.  If 
20101224235559.000|20101224235602.000|TR0|you got mice, you don't have rats.  
20101224235602.000|20101224235604.000|TR0|Someone told me that.  If you have mice, 
20101224235604.000|20101224235607.000|TR0|you don't have rats.  Because the rats 
20101224235607.000|20101224235610.000|TR0|would kill the mice.  So if you have mice, 
20101224235610.000|20101224235612.000|TR0|that's a good sign.
20101224235612.000|20101224235615.000|TR0|
20101224235615.000|20101224235618.000|TR0|When I'm occupied, a lot of times I can do 
20101224235618.000|20101224235620.000|TR0|things.  There are times when I can't.  
20101224235620.000|20101224235623.000|TR0|But it's -- I go on the -- I go on the -- 
20101224235623.000|20101224235626.000|TR0|I golf. I'm a terrible golfer.  And I 
20101224235626.000|20101224235628.000|TR0|started golfing in my 40s with 
20101224235628.000|20101224235631.000|TR0|Parkinson's.  If that isn't optimism, I 
20101224235631.000|20101224235634.000|TR0|don't know what is.  But I just do what I 
20101224235634.000|20101224235637.000|TR0|want to do.  And I just work with what I 
20101224235637.000|20101224235639.000|TR0|show up with that day.  And -- but that's 
20101224235639.000|20101224235642.000|TR0|me.  And again, I'm very lucky in a lot of 
20101224235642.000|20101224235645.000|TR0|ways.
20101224235645.000|20101224235647.000|TR0|
20101224235647.000|20101224235650.000|TR0|GUPTA:  What's the legacy of the 
20101224235650.000|20101224235653.000|TR0|foundation going to be?
20101224235653.000|20101224235655.000|TR0|
20101224235655.000|20101224235658.000|TR0|FOX:  Well hopefully, we'll accomplish our 
20101224235658.000|20101224235701.000|TR0|mission and in some way, facilitate a 
20101224235701.000|20101224235704.000|TR0|solution to this puzzle.  You know, it's 
20101224235704.000|20101224235706.000|TR0|completely soluble.  You know, we look at 
20101224235706.000|20101224235709.000|TR0|the things we've done, we've accomplished 
20101224235709.000|20101224235712.000|TR0|as a species, it really seems doable.  
20101224235712.000|20101224235714.000|TR0|It's just a matter those of us who are 
20101224235714.000|20101224235717.000|TR0|affected by it and concerned about it do 
20101224235717.000|20101224235720.000|TR0|what we can, whether it's clinical trials, 
20101224235720.000|20101224235722.000|TR0|whether it's supporting our foundation or 
20101224235722.000|20101224235725.000|TR0|other foundations, or politically or 
20101224235725.000|20101224235728.000|TR0|whatever.  But just know that you have an 
20101224235728.000|20101224235731.000|TR0|impact on the course (INAUDIBLE).  And if 
20101224235731.000|20101224235733.000|TR0|you insist on something, and you're 
20101224235733.000|20101224235736.000|TR0|willing to give what you need to give in 
20101224235736.000|20101224235739.000|TR0|order to make it happen, you know, it's 
20101224235739.000|20101224235741.000|TR0|doable.  It's accomplishable.
