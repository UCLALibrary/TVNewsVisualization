20101217140032.774|20101217140034.599|TR0|jail after a High Court ruled he 
20101217140034.599|20101217140036.424|TR0|could be released on bail.

20101217140040.074|20101217140041.899|TR0|following his arrest on an

20101217140123.873|20101217140125.698|TR0|to the police every day. As he

20101217140127.523|20101217140129.348|TR0|ultimately worried about a U.S.

20101217141541.605|20101217141543.430|TR0|yous: to all the people around 
20101217141543.430|20101217141545.255|TR0|the world who have had faith in 
20101217141545.255|20101217141547.080|TR0|me, who have supported my team 
20101217141547.080|20101217141548.905|TR0|while I've been away; to my 
20101217141548.905|20101217141550.730|TR0|lawyers, who have put up a brave 
20101217141550.730|20101217141552.555|TR0|and ultimately successful fight; 
20101217141552.555|20101217141554.380|TR0|to our sureties and people who 
20101217141554.380|20101217141556.204|TR0|provided money, in the face of 
20101217141556.204|20101217141558.029|TR0|great difficulty and aversion; 
20101217141558.029|20101217141559.854|TR0|and to members of the press, who 
20101217141559.854|20101217141601.679|TR0|were not all taken in and

20101217141603.504|20101217141605.329|TR0|their work; and, I guess, 
20101217141605.329|20101217141607.154|TR0|finally, to the British justice 
20101217141607.154|20101217141608.979|TR0|system itself, where, if justice 
20101217141608.979|20101217141610.804|TR0|is not always an outcome, at

20101217141614.454|20101217141616.279|TR0|During my time in solitary

20101217141618.104|20101217141619.929|TR0|Victorian prison, I had time to 
20101217141619.929|20101217141621.754|TR0|reflect on the conditions of 
20101217141621.754|20101217141623.579|TR0|those people around the world 
20101217141623.579|20101217141625.404|TR0|also in solitary confinement, 
20101217141625.404|20101217141627.229|TR0|also on remand, in conditions 
20101217141627.229|20101217141629.054|TR0|that are more difficult than 
20101217141629.054|20101217141630.879|TR0|those faced by me. Those people 
20101217141630.879|20101217141632.704|TR0|also need your attention and 
20101217141632.704|20101217141634.529|TR0|support.
20101217141634.529|20101217141636.354|TR0|
20101217141636.354|20101217141638.179|TR0|And with that, I hope to 
20101217141638.179|20101217141640.004|TR0|continue my work and continue to 
20101217141640.004|20101217141641.829|TR0|protest my innocence in this 
20101217141641.829|20101217141643.653|TR0|matter and to reveal, as we get 
20101217141643.653|20101217141645.478|TR0|it - which we have not yet - the

20101217141951.624|20101217141953.449|TR0|back 14 years. It's an amazing 
20101217141953.449|20101217141955.274|TR0|twisted saga, and the WikiLeaks 
20101217141955.274|20101217141957.099|TR0|development is just the latest 
20101217141957.099|20101217141958.924|TR0|twist in a just amazing story. 
20101217141958.924|20101217142000.749|TR0|In '96, Pfizer was trying to get 
20101217142000.749|20101217142002.574|TR0|approval for a new antibiotic 
20101217142002.574|20101217142004.399|TR0|they thought was going to be a 
20101217142004.399|20101217142006.224|TR0|blockbuster drug. And as part of 
20101217142006.224|20101217142008.049|TR0|this, they wanted to test it on 
20101217142008.049|20101217142009.874|TR0|children, because you could get 
20101217142009.874|20101217142011.699|TR0|an extension on your patent and 
20101217142011.699|20101217142013.524|TR0|make billions more, potentially, 
20101217142013.524|20101217142015.349|TR0|by testing on children. But it's 
20101217142015.349|20101217142017.174|TR0|very difficult to get children 
20101217142017.174|20101217142018.999|TR0|to take an experimental drug in 
20101217142018.999|20101217142020.824|TR0|the U.S. There's a lot of hoops 
20101217142020.824|20101217142022.649|TR0|to jump through. Parents are 
20101217142022.649|20101217142024.474|TR0|very protective. And this was a 
20101217142024.474|20101217142026.299|TR0|drug that had problems with 
20101217142026.299|20101217142028.124|TR0|young mammals. When it was given 
20101217142028.124|20101217142029.949|TR0|to rabbits and dogs that were 
20101217142029.949|20101217142031.774|TR0|not fully developed, they became 
20101217142031.774|20101217142033.599|TR0|arthritic and crippled.
20101217142033.599|20101217142035.424|TR0|
20101217142035.424|20101217142037.248|TR0|And so, they were trying to put 
20101217142037.248|20101217142039.073|TR0|together the trials, and during 
20101217142039.073|20101217142040.898|TR0|this time, one of the lead 
20101217142040.898|20101217142042.723|TR0|researchers who was in charge of 
20101217142042.723|20101217142044.548|TR0|this drug called Trovan saw that 
20101217142044.548|20101217142046.373|TR0|there was a record meningitis 
20101217142046.373|20101217142048.198|TR0|epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
20101217142048.198|20101217142050.023|TR0|They very quickly, in a matter 
20101217142050.023|20101217142051.848|TR0|of weeks, put together a 
20101217142051.848|20101217142053.673|TR0|clinical trial, loaded up their 
20101217142053.673|20101217142055.498|TR0|experimental drug on a DC-9, and 
20101217142055.498|20101217142057.323|TR0|flew it to northern Nigeria. 
20101217142057.323|20101217142059.148|TR0|Generally, these pediatric 
20101217142059.148|20101217142100.973|TR0|trials, they can take years to 
20101217142100.973|20101217142102.798|TR0|put together. This was done very 
20101217142102.798|20101217142104.623|TR0|quickly.
20101217142104.623|20101217142106.448|TR0|
20101217142106.448|20101217142108.273|TR0|They arrived at one of the most 
20101217142108.273|20101217142110.098|TR0|disgusting, fetid hospitals in 
20101217142110.098|20101217142111.923|TR0|the world, according to Doctors 
20101217142111.923|20101217142113.748|TR0|Without Borders, in Kano. And 
20101217142113.748|20101217142115.573|TR0|this hospital was besieged with 
20101217142115.573|20101217142117.398|TR0|patients, people bringing in 
20101217142117.398|20101217142119.223|TR0|their children, often carried on 
20101217142119.223|20101217142121.048|TR0|their backs, to this epidemic 
20101217142121.048|20101217142122.873|TR0|camp. And Doctors Without 
20101217142122.873|20101217142124.697|TR0|Borders had set up there. They 
20101217142124.697|20101217142126.522|TR0|were using an approved drug to 
20101217142126.522|20101217142128.347|TR0|treat children. Pfizer came in, 
20101217142128.347|20101217142130.172|TR0|took over some wards, and 
20101217142130.172|20101217142131.997|TR0|started giving out their 
20101217142131.997|20101217142133.822|TR0|experimental drug. Half the 
20101217142133.822|20101217142135.647|TR0|children got Trovan; half got a 
20101217142135.647|20101217142137.472|TR0|proven drug. But they got a 
20101217142137.472|20101217142139.297|TR0|substandard dose. And Pfizer was 
20101217142139.297|20101217142141.122|TR0|there for a few weeks, tried out 
20101217142141.122|20101217142142.947|TR0|its drug, and flew back out.
20101217142142.947|20101217142144.772|TR0|
20101217142144.772|20101217142146.597|TR0|No one really knew, other than 
20101217142146.597|20101217142148.422|TR0|people who were in this 
20101217142148.422|20101217142150.247|TR0|hospital, knew this had taken 
20101217142150.247|20101217142152.072|TR0|place, until we came in four 
20101217142152.072|20101217142153.897|TR0|years later, in 2000, and did an 
20101217142153.897|20101217142155.722|TR0|investigative look at this. And 
20101217142155.722|20101217142157.547|TR0|what we found is that Pfizer had 
20101217142157.547|20101217142159.372|TR0|no written, signed informed 
20101217142159.372|20101217142201.197|TR0|consent forms from parents, 
20101217142201.197|20101217142203.022|TR0|which would prove that the 
20101217142203.022|20101217142204.847|TR0|parents knew that their children 
20101217142204.847|20101217142206.672|TR0|were taking an experimental drug 
20101217142206.672|20101217142208.497|TR0|and had agreed to this. That's 
20101217142208.497|20101217142210.321|TR0|standard procedure in the West, 
20101217142210.321|20101217142212.146|TR0|in the U.S. and Europe. They 
20101217142212.146|20101217142213.971|TR0|didn't have these. Pfizer says, 
20101217142213.971|20101217142215.796|TR0|nonetheless, that parents knew 
20101217142215.796|20101217142217.621|TR0|what they were doing. Some 
20101217142217.621|20101217142219.446|TR0|people who were in the hospital 
20101217142219.446|20101217142221.271|TR0|at the time told us they had no 
20101217142221.271|20101217142223.096|TR0|idea what they were doing.
20101217142223.096|20101217142224.921|TR0|
20101217142224.921|20101217142226.746|TR0|They defended their trial and 
20101217142226.746|20101217142228.571|TR0|said that this was an ethical 
20101217142228.571|20101217142230.396|TR0|trial to do, partly because they 
20101217142230.396|20101217142232.221|TR0|had an ethics approval from 
20101217142232.221|20101217142234.046|TR0|Nigeria, and they gave us a copy 
20101217142234.046|20101217142235.871|TR0|of this report. We later found 
20101217142235.871|20101217142237.696|TR0|out that this was not a real 
20101217142237.696|20101217142239.521|TR0|ethics approval letter, that the 
20101217142239.521|20101217142241.346|TR0|letterhead it was composed on 
20101217142241.346|20101217142243.171|TR0|didn't exist at the time of the 
20101217142243.171|20101217142244.996|TR0|trial. And later, the lead 
20101217142244.996|20101217142246.821|TR0|investigator for Pfizer in 
20101217142246.821|20101217142248.646|TR0|Nigeria acknowledged to us that 
20101217142248.646|20101217142250.471|TR0|when there was an FDA audit in 
20101217142250.471|20101217142252.296|TR0|the U.S., Pfizer had called and 
20101217142252.296|20101217142254.121|TR0|said, "We need a copy of this 
20101217142254.121|20101217142255.946|TR0|ethics approval letter 
20101217142255.946|20101217142257.770|TR0|immediately." He went to his 
20101217142257.770|20101217142259.595|TR0|office, put it together, signed 
20101217142259.595|20101217142301.420|TR0|it himself, backdated it a 
20101217142301.420|20101217142303.245|TR0|number of years, and then sent 
20101217142303.245|20101217142305.070|TR0|it over to Pfizer headquarters. 
20101217142305.070|20101217142306.895|TR0|So this has been going on for a 
20101217142306.895|20101217142308.720|TR0|long time.
20101217142308.720|20101217142310.545|TR0|
20101217142310.545|20101217142312.370|TR0|After our stories, there was an 
20101217142312.370|20101217142314.195|TR0|official federal investigation 
20101217142314.195|20101217142316.020|TR0|in Nigeria. But it was never 
20101217142316.020|20101217142317.845|TR0|made public. It disappeared. And 
20101217142317.845|20101217142319.670|TR0|many years later, we finally got 
20101217142319.670|20101217142321.495|TR0|a copy of this report. It 
20101217142321.495|20101217142323.320|TR0|concluded that Pfizer had 
20101217142323.320|20101217142325.145|TR0|violated both Nigerian law and 
20101217142325.145|20101217142326.970|TR0|international law and was very 
20101217142326.970|20101217142328.795|TR0|critical. It also mentioned that 
20101217142328.795|20101217142330.620|TR0|members of the investigative 
20101217142330.620|20101217142332.445|TR0|panel had been the target of 
20101217142332.445|20101217142334.270|TR0|death threats during their 
20101217142334.270|20101217142336.095|TR0|investigation. We were told 
20101217142336.095|20101217142337.920|TR0|there were three copies of this 
20101217142337.920|20101217142339.745|TR0|report. Attorneys in the U.S. 
20101217142339.745|20101217142341.570|TR0|who brought a class action 
20101217142341.570|20101217142343.395|TR0|lawsuit said they had spent 
20101217142343.395|20101217142345.219|TR0|years trying to find this report 
20101217142345.219|20101217142347.044|TR0|that we came up with. One they 
20101217142347.044|20101217142348.869|TR0|tracked to a safe. And when they 
20101217142348.869|20101217142350.694|TR0|opened the safe, it was not 
20101217142350.694|20101217142352.519|TR0|there. Another was supposedly in 
20101217142352.519|20101217142354.344|TR0|the possession of a man who died 
20101217142354.344|20101217142356.169|TR0|before lawyers got to him.
20101217142356.169|20101217142357.994|TR0|
20101217142357.994|20101217142359.819|TR0|After we made this report 
20101217142359.819|20101217142401.644|TR0|public, there was a new set of 
20101217142401.644|20101217142403.469|TR0|public officials in power in 
20101217142403.469|20101217142405.294|TR0|Nigeria, and they decided to 
20101217142405.294|20101217142407.119|TR0|bring criminal and civil charges 
20101217142407.119|20101217142408.944|TR0|against Pfizer, including 
20101217142408.944|20101217142410.769|TR0|homicide - both Pfizer and some 
20101217142410.769|20101217142412.594|TR0|current and former employees of 
20101217142412.594|20101217142414.419|TR0|Pfizer. The state of Kano in the 
20101217142414.419|20101217142416.244|TR0|northern Nigeria settled for $75 
20101217142416.244|20101217142418.069|TR0|million. The federal charges, 
20101217142418.069|20101217142419.894|TR0|which initially were seeking $7 
20101217142419.894|20101217142421.719|TR0|billion from Pfizer, just sort 
20101217142421.719|20101217142423.544|TR0|of evaporated. We never knew 
20101217142423.544|20101217142425.369|TR0|what happened to them. And now, 
20101217142425.369|20101217142427.194|TR0|this new revelation comes out 
20101217142427.194|20101217142429.019|TR0|and raises very serious 
20101217142429.019|20101217142430.843|TR0|questions about why those 
20101217142430.843|20101217142432.668|TR0|charges just evaporated.
20101217142432.668|20101217142434.493|TR0|
20101217142434.493|20101217142436.318|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We're going to 
20101217142436.318|20101217142438.143|TR0|go to break, and then we will 
20101217142438.143|20101217142439.968|TR0|come back. We're talking to Joe 
20101217142439.968|20101217142441.793|TR0|Stephens, who's a reporter at 
20101217142441.793|20101217142443.618|TR0|the Washington Post who broke 
20101217142443.618|20101217142445.443|TR0|this story with others in a long 
20101217142445.443|20101217142447.268|TR0|investigative series in the year 
20101217142447.268|20101217142449.093|TR0|2000, and now they have surfaced 
20101217142449.093|20101217142450.918|TR0|again in this U.S. diplomatic 
20101217142450.918|20101217142452.743|TR0|cable that was released by 
20101217142452.743|20101217142454.568|TR0|WikiLeaks. We'll also be joined 
20101217142454.568|20101217142456.393|TR0|by a Nigerian journalist who has 
20101217142456.393|20101217142458.218|TR0|worked on this story, Musikilu 
20101217142458.218|20101217142500.043|TR0|Mojeed. This is Democracy Now! 
20101217142500.043|20101217142501.868|TR0|We'll be back with them in a 
20101217142501.868|20101217142503.693|TR0|minute.
20101217142503.693|20101217142505.518|TR0|

20101217142509.168|20101217142510.993|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Today we're 
20101217142510.993|20101217142512.818|TR0|doing a special on the power of 
20101217142512.818|20101217142514.643|TR0|the drug industry, the most 
20101217142514.643|20101217142516.468|TR0|powerful industry, the largest 
20101217142516.468|20101217142518.292|TR0|defrauder of the federal 
20101217142518.292|20101217142520.117|TR0|government. We'll talk about 
20101217142520.117|20101217142521.942|TR0|that at the end of the 
20101217142521.942|20101217142523.767|TR0|broadcast. Right now, we're 
20101217142523.767|20101217142525.592|TR0|looking at a drug test that was 
20101217142525.592|20101217142527.417|TR0|done in Nigeria on 200 Nigerian 
20101217142527.417|20101217142529.242|TR0|children. Eleven died. A number 
20101217142529.242|20101217142531.067|TR0|were maimed. The drug test was 
20101217142531.067|20101217142532.892|TR0|conducted by the Pfizer 
20101217142532.892|20101217142534.717|TR0|corporation.
20101217142534.717|20101217142536.542|TR0|
20101217142536.542|20101217142538.367|TR0|We're joined by Joe Stephens, 
20101217142538.367|20101217142540.192|TR0|Washington Post reporter in the 
20101217142540.192|20101217142542.017|TR0|offices of the Washington Post 
20101217142542.017|20101217142543.842|TR0|in Washington, and Musikilu 
20101217142543.842|20101217142545.667|TR0|Mojeed, a Nigerian journalist 
20101217142545.667|20101217142547.492|TR0|who's based here in New York. 
20101217142547.492|20101217142549.317|TR0|Juan?
20101217142549.317|20101217142551.142|TR0|
20101217142551.142|20101217142552.967|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Yeah, Joe 
20101217142552.967|20101217142554.792|TR0|Stephens, I'd like to ask you 
20101217142554.792|20101217142556.617|TR0|about what the requirements are, 
20101217142556.617|20101217142558.442|TR0|in terms of both the U.S. 
20101217142558.442|20101217142600.267|TR0|government and foreign 
20101217142600.267|20101217142602.092|TR0|governments, on these tests, 
20101217142602.092|20101217142603.917|TR0|because, as you've outlined in 
20101217142603.917|20101217142605.741|TR0|what you told us before the 
20101217142605.741|20101217142607.566|TR0|break, it's since been proven 
20101217142607.566|20101217142609.391|TR0|that they were backdating 
20101217142609.391|20101217142611.216|TR0|information, providing 
20101217142611.216|20101217142613.041|TR0|fraudulent documentation. This 
20101217142613.041|20101217142614.866|TR0|documentation obviously went 
20101217142614.866|20101217142616.691|TR0|over the mail, so conceivably 
20101217142616.691|20101217142618.516|TR0|even the U.S. government could 
20101217142618.516|20101217142620.341|TR0|go after Pfizer for 
20101217142620.341|20101217142622.166|TR0|participating in basically 
20101217142622.166|20101217142623.991|TR0|fraudulent - for wire fraud, 
20101217142623.991|20101217142625.816|TR0|information that they were going 
20101217142625.816|20101217142627.641|TR0|back and forth between the 
20101217142627.641|20101217142629.466|TR0|United States and Nigeria. But 
20101217142629.466|20101217142631.291|TR0|what about the Nigerian 
20101217142631.291|20101217142633.116|TR0|government? What did they know 
20101217142633.116|20101217142634.941|TR0|before Pfizer went in on this 
20101217142634.941|20101217142636.766|TR0|trial?
20101217142636.766|20101217142638.591|TR0|
20101217142638.591|20101217142640.416|TR0|>> JOE STEPHENS: Well, Pfizer 
20101217142640.416|20101217142642.241|TR0|says they got full approval 
20101217142642.241|20101217142644.066|TR0|going in. There is not a lot of 
20101217142644.066|20101217142645.891|TR0|evidence of that. And the 
20101217142645.891|20101217142647.716|TR0|Nigerian government says now 
20101217142647.716|20101217142649.541|TR0|that's not the case. And we've 
20101217142649.541|20101217142651.365|TR0|talked to a lot of people who 
20101217142651.365|20101217142653.190|TR0|think that Pfizer did not get 
20101217142653.190|20101217142655.015|TR0|approval and that they were 
20101217142655.015|20101217142656.840|TR0|coming in quickly. There was a 
20101217142656.840|20101217142658.665|TR0|record meningitis epidemic, and 
20101217142658.665|20101217142700.490|TR0|Pfizer thought this would also 
20101217142700.490|20101217142702.315|TR0|give them a halo effect over 
20101217142702.315|20101217142704.140|TR0|their drug by using it in a 
20101217142704.140|20101217142705.965|TR0|humanitarian fashion. Doctors 
20101217142705.965|20101217142707.790|TR0|Without Borders, who was 
20101217142707.790|20101217142709.615|TR0|operating in the hospital, saw 
20101217142709.615|20101217142711.440|TR0|it differently and thought they 
20101217142711.440|20101217142713.265|TR0|were operating humanely and 
20101217142713.265|20101217142715.090|TR0|Pfizer perhaps was not.
20101217142715.090|20101217142716.915|TR0|
20101217142716.915|20101217142718.740|TR0|But there's very few controls 
20101217142718.740|20101217142720.565|TR0|around the world. The U.S. 
20101217142720.565|20101217142722.390|TR0|government can't control what 
20101217142722.390|20101217142724.215|TR0|goes on in Nigeria. At best, 
20101217142724.215|20101217142726.040|TR0|they can control what the 
20101217142726.040|20101217142727.865|TR0|results of the drug trials are 
20101217142727.865|20101217142729.690|TR0|used for back in the U.S., 
20101217142729.690|20101217142731.515|TR0|because this clearly was a trial 
20101217142731.515|20101217142733.340|TR0|that would have impacted the 
20101217142733.340|20101217142735.165|TR0|approval of the drug in the U.S. 
20101217142735.165|20101217142736.990|TR0|And by the way, the drug was 
20101217142736.990|20101217142738.814|TR0|ultimately approved. It was 
20101217142738.814|20101217142740.639|TR0|never approved for use by 
20101217142740.639|20101217142742.464|TR0|children in the U.S. or Europe. 
20101217142742.464|20101217142744.289|TR0|But then it was associated with 
20101217142744.289|20101217142746.114|TR0|liver toxicity and taken off the 
20101217142746.114|20101217142747.939|TR0|market. It's not used at all in 
20101217142747.939|20101217142749.764|TR0|Europe anymore and only in very 
20101217142749.764|20101217142751.589|TR0|rare cases in the U.S. But it's 
20101217142751.589|20101217142753.414|TR0|very hard for the U.S. to 
20101217142753.414|20101217142755.239|TR0|legislate what happens overseas. 
20101217142755.239|20101217142757.064|TR0|And when you're in a state which 
20101217142757.064|20101217142758.889|TR0|doesn't operate smoothly, a 
20101217142758.889|20101217142800.714|TR0|failing state, there are very 
20101217142800.714|20101217142802.539|TR0|few controls, so you're left at 
20101217142802.539|20101217142804.364|TR0|the mercy of the local officials 
20101217142804.364|20101217142806.189|TR0|in place at the time. And 
20101217142806.189|20101217142808.014|TR0|Nigeria is a very complicated 
20101217142808.014|20101217142809.839|TR0|company - country. And at the 
20101217142809.839|20101217142811.664|TR0|time, in northern Nigeria, also 
20101217142811.664|20101217142813.489|TR0|the federal government had 
20101217142813.489|20101217142815.314|TR0|limited control of that region. 
20101217142815.314|20101217142817.139|TR0|It's obviously a country which 
20101217142817.139|20101217142818.964|TR0|ranks near the bottom in various 
20101217142818.964|20101217142820.789|TR0|corruption indices. There have 
20101217142820.789|20101217142822.614|TR0|been allegations of money 
20101217142822.614|20101217142824.439|TR0|changing hands before this 
20101217142824.439|20101217142826.263|TR0|WikiLeaks allegation. So, it's 
20101217142826.263|20101217142828.088|TR0|very, very difficult to police.
20101217142828.088|20101217142829.913|TR0|
20101217142829.913|20101217142831.738|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Musikilu Mojeed, 
20101217142831.738|20101217142833.563|TR0|you have followed this story for 
20101217142833.563|20101217142835.388|TR0|your newspaper, NEXT. Can you 
20101217142835.388|20101217142837.213|TR0|talk about what the effect of 
20101217142837.213|20101217142839.038|TR0|the exposure of this trial by 
20101217142839.038|20101217142840.863|TR0|Pfizer had in Nigeria and the 
20101217142840.863|20101217142842.688|TR0|story of how Pfizer tried to 
20101217142842.688|20101217142844.513|TR0|smear the attorney general who 
20101217142844.513|20101217142846.338|TR0|was trying to bring these issues 
20101217142846.338|20101217142848.163|TR0|up?
20101217142848.163|20101217142849.988|TR0|
20101217142849.988|20101217142851.813|TR0|>> MUSIKILU MOJEED: Yeah. 
20101217142851.813|20101217142853.638|TR0|Nigerians are clearly outraged 
20101217142853.638|20101217142855.463|TR0|by this revelation that Pfizer 
20101217142855.463|20101217142857.288|TR0|hired investigators to smear the 
20101217142857.288|20101217142859.113|TR0|attorney general, to blackmail 
20101217142859.113|20101217142900.938|TR0|him to drop the federal charges. 
20101217142900.938|20101217142902.763|TR0|But not a lot of people are 
20101217142902.763|20101217142904.588|TR0|entirely surprised in Nigeria, 
20101217142904.588|20101217142906.413|TR0|because before the WikiLeak 
20101217142906.413|20101217142908.238|TR0|cable came out, our newspaper, 
20101217142908.238|20101217142910.063|TR0|NEXT, had exposed the mysterious 
20101217142910.063|20101217142911.887|TR0|disappearance of the federal 
20101217142911.887|20101217142913.712|TR0|charges against Pfizer. You 
20101217142913.712|20101217142915.537|TR0|know, suddenly, the case just 
20101217142915.537|20101217142917.362|TR0|disappeared. Nobody knew how the 
20101217142917.362|20101217142919.187|TR0|case was withdrawn. Nigerians 
20101217142919.187|20101217142921.012|TR0|were not told. It was just done 
20101217142921.012|20101217142922.837|TR0|in secret. And our newspaper 
20101217142922.837|20101217142924.662|TR0|broke this story. That is, a $6 
20101217142924.662|20101217142926.487|TR0|billion federal suit against 
20101217142926.487|20101217142928.312|TR0|Pfizer disappeared secretly, 
20101217142928.312|20101217142930.137|TR0|that the attorney general simply 
20101217142930.137|20101217142931.962|TR0|did - went into a secret deal 
20101217142931.962|20101217142933.787|TR0|with Pfizer and a few Nigerian 
20101217142933.787|20101217142935.612|TR0|lawyers without anybody knowing 
20101217142935.612|20101217142937.437|TR0|about it. In fact, Pfizer may 
20101217142937.437|20101217142939.262|TR0|have violated U.S. law, because 
20101217142939.262|20101217142941.087|TR0|Pfizer refused to disclose the 
20101217142941.087|20101217142942.912|TR0|details of that settlement, even 
20101217142942.912|20101217142944.737|TR0|in its filing for the quarter of 
20101217142944.737|20101217142946.562|TR0|2009 to the U.S. government. So, 
20101217142946.562|20101217142948.387|TR0|Nigerians are clearly outraged.
20101217142948.387|20101217142950.212|TR0|
20101217142950.212|20101217142952.037|TR0|And even the attorney general, 
20101217142952.037|20101217142953.862|TR0|the former attorney general, 
20101217142953.862|20101217142955.687|TR0|himself, is threatening that he 
20101217142955.687|20101217142957.512|TR0|might sue Pfizer for 
20101217142957.512|20101217142959.336|TR0|blackmailing him. But in any 
20101217142959.336|20101217143001.161|TR0|case, the attorney general 
20101217143001.161|20101217143002.986|TR0|himself is known to be terribly 
20101217143002.986|20101217143004.811|TR0|corrupt. So a lot of people are 
20101217143004.811|20101217143006.636|TR0|not surprised, because he's know 
20101217143006.636|20101217143008.461|TR0|to be a corrupt man. He cannot 
20101217143008.461|20101217143010.286|TR0|enter the United States, because 
20101217143010.286|20101217143012.111|TR0|the U.S. government has barred 
20101217143012.111|20101217143013.936|TR0|him, has withdrawn his visa and 
20101217143013.936|20101217143015.761|TR0|that of his family, because he's 
20101217143015.761|20101217143017.586|TR0|known to be corrupt. But a lot 
20101217143017.586|20101217143019.411|TR0|of people are outraged that 
20101217143019.411|20101217143021.236|TR0|Pfizer could go to that extent 
20101217143021.236|20101217143023.061|TR0|to hire an investigator to 
20101217143023.061|20101217143024.886|TR0|blackmail a Nigerian official.

20101217143028.536|20101217143030.361|TR0|when the reports of this failed 
20101217143030.361|20101217143032.186|TR0|trial came out, what was the 
20101217143032.186|20101217143034.011|TR0|reaction in Nigeria and of the 
20101217143034.011|20101217143035.836|TR0|press and the government at the 
20101217143035.836|20101217143037.661|TR0|time?
20101217143037.661|20101217143039.486|TR0|
20101217143039.486|20101217143041.311|TR0|>> MUSIKILU MOJEED: Yeah, as Joe 
20101217143041.311|20101217143043.136|TR0|said, you know, Nigerians didn't 
20101217143043.136|20101217143044.961|TR0|know, because it was just for a 
20101217143044.961|20101217143046.785|TR0|brief period. Pfizer just went 
20101217143046.785|20101217143048.610|TR0|in, you know, briefly, and there 
20101217143048.610|20101217143050.435|TR0|was so much confusion in 
20101217143050.435|20101217143052.260|TR0|Nigeria. Nigeria needed help. 
20101217143052.260|20101217143054.085|TR0|There was this epidemic. The 
20101217143054.085|20101217143055.910|TR0|country just needed help from 
20101217143055.910|20101217143057.735|TR0|wherever, you know. And Pfizer 
20101217143057.735|20101217143059.560|TR0|came on a humanitarian ground. 
20101217143059.560|20101217143101.385|TR0|Nigeria accepted. And at the 
20101217143101.385|20101217143103.210|TR0|time, we had military 
20101217143103.210|20101217143105.035|TR0|dictatorship. Things were so 
20101217143105.035|20101217143106.860|TR0|bad. There was no order in the 
20101217143106.860|20101217143108.685|TR0|country. There was no proper 
20101217143108.685|20101217143110.510|TR0|procedures, whenever following 
20101217143110.510|20101217143112.335|TR0|[inaudible] that happened at the 
20101217143112.335|20101217143114.160|TR0|time. So, really, at the time, 
20101217143114.160|20101217143115.985|TR0|Nigerians were grateful to 
20101217143115.985|20101217143117.810|TR0|Pfizer, and we never knew, until 
20101217143117.810|20101217143119.635|TR0|it broke out in the press 
20101217143119.635|20101217143121.460|TR0|several years later, and 
20101217143121.460|20101217143123.285|TR0|Nigerians were really, really 
20101217143123.285|20101217143125.110|TR0|outraged. Yeah.

20101217143130.585|20101217143132.409|TR0|with us. And finally, Joe 
20101217143132.409|20101217143134.234|TR0|Stephens, the WikiLeaks document 
20101217143134.234|20101217143136.059|TR0|- ten seconds - what did you 
20101217143136.059|20101217143137.884|TR0|learn from what the U.S. 
20101217143137.884|20101217143139.709|TR0|diplomatic cables said about 
20101217143139.709|20101217143141.534|TR0|Pfizer in Nigeria?

20101217143143.359|20101217143145.184|TR0|>> JOE STEPHENS: Well, 
20101217143145.184|20101217143147.009|TR0|obviously, the allegations that 
20101217143147.009|20101217143148.834|TR0|something that sounds 
20101217143148.834|20101217143150.659|TR0|dangerously close to blackmail 
20101217143150.659|20101217143152.484|TR0|is being discussed, that's 
20101217143152.484|20101217143154.309|TR0|shocking. But also shocking is 
20101217143154.309|20101217143156.134|TR0|that Pfizer felt comfortable 
20101217143156.134|20101217143157.959|TR0|telling this to a State 
20101217143157.959|20101217143159.784|TR0|Department official, and it went 
20101217143159.784|20101217143201.609|TR0|back to Washington in a cable 
20101217143201.609|20101217143203.434|TR0|from the ambassador. And there's 
20101217143203.434|20101217143205.259|TR0|nothing critical in this report, 
20101217143205.259|20101217143207.084|TR0|which makes you wonder what the 
20101217143207.084|20101217143208.909|TR0|official U.S. government 
20101217143208.909|20101217143210.734|TR0|position was on these activities

20101217143416.656|20101217143418.481|TR0|outside the United States, 
20101217143418.481|20101217143420.306|TR0|usually in countries where 
20101217143420.306|20101217143422.131|TR0|regulations are less stringent 
20101217143422.131|20101217143423.956|TR0|and trials are much cheaper.
20101217143423.956|20101217143425.781|TR0|
20101217143425.781|20101217143427.606|TR0|Twenty years ago, only 271 
20101217143427.606|20101217143429.431|TR0|trials of drugs intended for use 
20101217143429.431|20101217143431.256|TR0|by Americans were conducted 
20101217143431.256|20101217143433.081|TR0|overseas. By 2008, the number 
20101217143433.081|20101217143434.906|TR0|had risen to nearly 6,500, an 
20101217143434.906|20101217143436.731|TR0|increase of more than 2,000 
20101217143436.731|20101217143438.556|TR0|percent. Thousands of trials are 
20101217143438.556|20101217143440.380|TR0|taking place in countries with 
20101217143440.380|20101217143442.205|TR0|large numbers of poor, often 
20101217143442.205|20101217143444.030|TR0|illiterate, people who in some 
20101217143444.030|20101217143445.855|TR0|cases sign consent forms with a 
20101217143445.855|20101217143447.680|TR0|thumb print or scratch an "X."

20101217143451.330|20101217143453.155|TR0|the outsourcing of drug tests 
20101217143453.155|20101217143454.980|TR0|has been deadly. In Argentina, 
20101217143454.980|20101217143456.805|TR0|seven babies died while enrolled 
20101217143456.805|20101217143458.630|TR0|in clinical trials for 
20101217143458.630|20101217143500.455|TR0|GlaxoSmithKline. In New Delhi, 
20101217143500.455|20101217143502.280|TR0|India, 49 babies died at the All

20101217143520.530|20101217143522.355|TR0|Welcome to Democracy Now!, Jim 
20101217143522.355|20101217143524.180|TR0|Steele. Welcome back. You have 
20101217143524.180|20101217143526.004|TR0|won virtually every major 
20101217143526.004|20101217143527.829|TR0|national journalism award, 
20101217143527.829|20101217143529.654|TR0|including two Pulitzer Prizes, 
20101217143529.654|20101217143531.479|TR0|two National Magazine Awards. 
20101217143531.479|20101217143533.304|TR0|The latest piece in Vanity Fair 
20101217143533.304|20101217143535.129|TR0|is called "Deadly Medicine." 
20101217143535.129|20101217143536.954|TR0|Explain exactly the scope of 
20101217143536.954|20101217143538.779|TR0|your investigation, the 
20101217143538.779|20101217143540.604|TR0|companies involved, the 
20101217143540.604|20101217143542.429|TR0|countries where experiments are 
20101217143542.429|20101217143544.254|TR0|done, and what it has to do with 
20101217143544.254|20101217143546.079|TR0|the U.S.
20101217143546.079|20101217143547.904|TR0|
20101217143547.904|20101217143549.729|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: Well, first of 
20101217143549.729|20101217143551.554|TR0|all, it's very good to be back 
20101217143551.554|20101217143553.379|TR0|with you both, and especially 
20101217143553.379|20101217143555.204|TR0|this program today. And Joe 
20101217143555.204|20101217143557.029|TR0|Stephens actually just hit the 
20101217143557.029|20101217143558.854|TR0|nail on the head when he said at 
20101217143558.854|20101217143600.679|TR0|the heart of this issue is that 
20101217143600.679|20101217143602.504|TR0|the U.S. loses control, the U.S. 
20101217143602.504|20101217143604.329|TR0|government loses control, in 
20101217143604.329|20101217143606.154|TR0|these foreign trials.
20101217143606.154|20101217143607.979|TR0|
20101217143607.979|20101217143609.804|TR0|I think what surprised us the 
20101217143609.804|20101217143611.629|TR0|most about this whole story is 
20101217143611.629|20101217143613.453|TR0|that - there have always been 
20101217143613.453|20101217143615.278|TR0|some foreign clinical trials. 
20101217143615.278|20101217143617.103|TR0|That, on its face, is not new. 
20101217143617.103|20101217143618.928|TR0|What astonished us was the speed 
20101217143618.928|20101217143620.753|TR0|with which this has happened. 
20101217143620.753|20101217143622.578|TR0|The statistics that Juan quoted 
20101217143622.578|20101217143624.403|TR0|there at the beginning come from 
20101217143624.403|20101217143626.228|TR0|an inspector general's report 
20101217143626.228|20101217143628.053|TR0|just released this last year. 
20101217143628.053|20101217143629.878|TR0|But the speed of this has 
20101217143629.878|20101217143631.703|TR0|actually accelerated very much 
20101217143631.703|20101217143633.528|TR0|in the last five to 10 years. 
20101217143633.528|20101217143635.353|TR0|It's not just western Europe; 
20101217143635.353|20101217143637.178|TR0|it's parts of the former Soviet 
20101217143637.178|20101217143639.003|TR0|Republic, it's places in Africa, 
20101217143639.003|20101217143640.828|TR0|developing nations in Asia. But 
20101217143640.828|20101217143642.653|TR0|the two countries that are going 
20101217143642.653|20101217143644.478|TR0|to be at the heart of this more 
20101217143644.478|20101217143646.303|TR0|and more in the future are going 
20101217143646.303|20101217143648.128|TR0|to be China and India, which 
20101217143648.128|20101217143649.953|TR0|have both made this a priority. 
20101217143649.953|20101217143651.778|TR0|The Indians have revamped their 
20101217143651.778|20101217143653.603|TR0|laws to encourage the 
20101217143653.603|20101217143655.428|TR0|development of the clinical 
20101217143655.428|20101217143657.253|TR0|trial industry over there. China 
20101217143657.253|20101217143659.078|TR0|has made such a priority on 
20101217143659.078|20101217143700.902|TR0|teaching English that they're 
20101217143700.902|20101217143702.727|TR0|going to be a big factor in 
20101217143702.727|20101217143704.552|TR0|this. You now have more people 
20101217143704.552|20101217143706.377|TR0|speaking English in China than 
20101217143706.377|20101217143708.202|TR0|in India, which I think was one 
20101217143708.202|20101217143710.027|TR0|of the things that surprised us 
20101217143710.027|20101217143711.852|TR0|about this whole story.
20101217143711.852|20101217143713.677|TR0|
20101217143713.677|20101217143715.502|TR0|So, more and more of these are 
20101217143715.502|20101217143717.327|TR0|going to be moving abroad, as 
20101217143717.327|20101217143719.152|TR0|you mentioned earlier. Part of 
20101217143719.152|20101217143720.977|TR0|it is expense. And the irony of 
20101217143720.977|20101217143722.802|TR0|this is that at the same time 
20101217143722.802|20101217143724.627|TR0|it's cheaper for the companies 
20101217143724.627|20101217143726.452|TR0|to go abroad, not just from the 
20101217143726.452|20101217143728.277|TR0|cost over there and the fact 
20101217143728.277|20101217143730.102|TR0|that there's very little 
20101217143730.102|20101217143731.927|TR0|regulation, but it also is much 
20101217143731.927|20101217143733.752|TR0|more expensive for the U.S. to 
20101217143733.752|20101217143735.577|TR0|even attempt to have any 
20101217143735.577|20101217143737.402|TR0|oversight over there. Simply the 
20101217143737.402|20101217143739.227|TR0|cost of doing that kind of work 
20101217143739.227|20101217143741.052|TR0|abroad is much greater, even if 
20101217143741.052|20101217143742.877|TR0|there were the instinct and the 
20101217143742.877|20101217143744.702|TR0|desire to do that.
20101217143744.702|20101217143746.526|TR0|
20101217143746.526|20101217143748.351|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, Jim 
20101217143748.351|20101217143750.176|TR0|Steele, one of the things I 
20101217143750.176|20101217143752.001|TR0|noted in your article is that 
20101217143752.001|20101217143753.826|TR0|when you began talking about the 
20101217143753.826|20101217143755.651|TR0|FDA database of these clinical 
20101217143755.651|20101217143757.476|TR0|trials, that it's wholly 
20101217143757.476|20101217143759.301|TR0|inadequate and is not even 
20101217143759.301|20101217143801.126|TR0|really tracking all the trials 
20101217143801.126|20101217143802.951|TR0|that are occurring, so that that 
20101217143802.951|20101217143804.776|TR0|would seem to indicate that some 
20101217143804.776|20101217143806.601|TR0|of these pharmaceutical firms 
20101217143806.601|20101217143808.426|TR0|could choose to hide the bad 
20101217143808.426|20101217143810.251|TR0|results of their clinical trials 
20101217143810.251|20101217143812.076|TR0|and only report the good ones.
20101217143812.076|20101217143813.901|TR0|
20101217143813.901|20101217143815.726|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: Absolutely. 
20101217143815.726|20101217143817.551|TR0|That struck us as much as any 
20101217143817.551|20101217143819.376|TR0|one fact in our investigation, 
20101217143819.376|20101217143821.201|TR0|that here you have a situation 
20101217143821.201|20101217143823.026|TR0|that when they start one of 
20101217143823.026|20101217143824.851|TR0|these trials somewhere, they 
20101217143824.851|20101217143826.676|TR0|don't have to report that to the 
20101217143826.676|20101217143828.501|TR0|FDA. In fact, they can conduct 
20101217143828.501|20101217143830.326|TR0|it for years and not report it 
20101217143830.326|20101217143832.151|TR0|to the FDA. And then at some 
20101217143832.151|20101217143833.975|TR0|point they may decide, because 
20101217143833.975|20101217143835.800|TR0|the results are so bad or 
20101217143835.800|20101217143837.625|TR0|because there have been adverse 
20101217143837.625|20101217143839.450|TR0|events - adverse events, in many 
20101217143839.450|20101217143841.275|TR0|cases, means people have died, 
20101217143841.275|20101217143843.100|TR0|in drug company lingo - when 
20101217143843.100|20101217143844.925|TR0|that happens, none of this is 
20101217143844.925|20101217143846.750|TR0|reported to the FDA. The only 
20101217143846.750|20101217143848.575|TR0|time the FDA becomes involved is 
20101217143848.575|20101217143850.400|TR0|when they actually make - a drug 
20101217143850.400|20101217143852.225|TR0|company makes an actual formal 
20101217143852.225|20101217143854.050|TR0|application to get a new drug 
20101217143854.050|20101217143855.875|TR0|sanctioned.
20101217143855.875|20101217143857.700|TR0|
20101217143857.700|20101217143859.525|TR0|But if you think about what 
20101217143859.525|20101217143901.350|TR0|research is about - trial and 
20101217143901.350|20101217143903.175|TR0|error, knowledge, things of that 
20101217143903.175|20101217143905.000|TR0|sort that researchers in so many 
20101217143905.000|20101217143906.825|TR0|other fields rely on the work of 
20101217143906.825|20101217143908.650|TR0|others, especially in this 
20101217143908.650|20101217143910.475|TR0|field, where people's lives are 
20101217143910.475|20101217143912.300|TR0|at stake, where experiments may 
20101217143912.300|20101217143914.125|TR0|have gone awry - other companies 
20101217143914.125|20101217143915.950|TR0|should need to know that as well 
20101217143915.950|20101217143917.775|TR0|as the FDA, but that's not even 
20101217143917.775|20101217143919.600|TR0|reported in this. The amazing 
20101217143919.600|20101217143921.424|TR0|thing about this to us is that 
20101217143921.424|20101217143923.249|TR0|not only are there no 
20101217143923.249|20101217143925.074|TR0|regulations really requiring 
20101217143925.074|20101217143926.899|TR0|them to report those trials, but 
20101217143926.899|20101217143928.724|TR0|even if there were, FDA has so 
20101217143928.724|20101217143930.549|TR0|few resources and so little 
20101217143930.549|20101217143932.374|TR0|will, it wouldn't even be able 
20101217143932.374|20101217143934.199|TR0|to do any kind of effective 
20101217143934.199|20101217143936.024|TR0|monitoring of that.
20101217143936.024|20101217143937.849|TR0|
20101217143937.849|20101217143939.674|TR0|So you have a situation here 
20101217143939.674|20101217143941.499|TR0|that's totally chaotic. I mean, 
20101217143941.499|20101217143943.324|TR0|the FDA's record of overseeing 
20101217143943.324|20101217143945.149|TR0|clinical trials in this country 
20101217143945.149|20101217143946.974|TR0|has not always been very good. 
20101217143946.974|20101217143948.799|TR0|But by these trials increasingly 
20101217143948.799|20101217143950.624|TR0|moving to places beyond the 
20101217143950.624|20101217143952.449|TR0|scope of the agency, where 
20101217143952.449|20101217143954.274|TR0|there's no knowledge, where 
20101217143954.274|20101217143956.099|TR0|there's nothing reported, now 
20101217143956.099|20101217143957.924|TR0|the agency is losing what little 
20101217143957.924|20101217143959.749|TR0|oversight and control it has. 
20101217143959.749|20101217144001.574|TR0|And the ramifications for the 
20101217144001.574|20101217144003.399|TR0|future, in terms of future drugs 
20101217144003.399|20101217144005.224|TR0|coming down the track, we think, 
20101217144005.224|20101217144007.048|TR0|are just potentially horrendous.
20101217144007.048|20101217144008.873|TR0|
20101217144008.873|20101217144010.698|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Jim, can you 
20101217144010.698|20101217144012.523|TR0|explain how you arrived at the 
20101217144012.523|20101217144014.348|TR0|number 200,000 people die a year 
20101217144014.348|20101217144016.173|TR0|from prescription medicine?
20101217144016.173|20101217144017.998|TR0|
20101217144017.998|20101217144019.823|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: Yes. There's a 
20101217144019.823|20101217144021.648|TR0|nonprofit organization based in 
20101217144021.648|20101217144023.473|TR0|Pennsylvania called the 
20101217144023.473|20101217144025.298|TR0|Institute of Safe Medication 
20101217144025.298|20101217144027.123|TR0|Practices, and they have 
20101217144027.123|20101217144028.948|TR0|documented the figure of - I 
20101217144028.948|20101217144030.773|TR0|think it's 19,500 individuals 
20101217144030.773|20101217144032.598|TR0|die roughly each - I think this 
20101217144032.598|20101217144034.423|TR0|was in 2008, 2009 - from 
20101217144034.423|20101217144036.248|TR0|prescription drugs. Any number 
20101217144036.248|20101217144038.073|TR0|of other studies have indicated 
20101217144038.073|20101217144039.898|TR0|this is a vastly understated 
20101217144039.898|20101217144041.723|TR0|number. That's no reflection on 
20101217144041.723|20101217144043.548|TR0|the institute; they do very good 
20101217144043.548|20101217144045.373|TR0|work. But everybody agrees that 
20101217144045.373|20101217144047.198|TR0|that number is woefully below 
20101217144047.198|20101217144049.023|TR0|what the real number is. Most of 
20101217144049.023|20101217144050.848|TR0|the estimates have put the 
20101217144050.848|20101217144052.673|TR0|figure around 10 percent. We 
20101217144052.673|20101217144054.497|TR0|actually looked into this issue 
20101217144054.497|20101217144056.322|TR0|in great detail when we wrote a 
20101217144056.322|20101217144058.147|TR0|book on the American healthcare 
20101217144058.147|20101217144059.972|TR0|system several years ago. And 
20101217144059.972|20101217144101.797|TR0|most people who look at this in 
20101217144101.797|20101217144103.622|TR0|any depth have concluded that 
20101217144103.622|20101217144105.447|TR0|the reported figures represent 
20101217144105.447|20101217144107.272|TR0|about 10 percent of the actual 
20101217144107.272|20101217144109.097|TR0|total deaths. So we concluded, 
20101217144109.097|20101217144110.922|TR0|therefore, that you're talking 
20101217144110.922|20101217144112.747|TR0|about 200,000 people dying 
20101217144112.747|20101217144114.572|TR0|pretty much yearly from 
20101217144114.572|20101217144116.397|TR0|prescription drugs. I mean, 
20101217144116.397|20101217144118.222|TR0|that's more than die from 
20101217144118.222|20101217144120.047|TR0|diabetes and a whole range of 
20101217144120.047|20101217144121.872|TR0|other illnesses that affect 
20101217144121.872|20101217144123.697|TR0|people out there. So, it's one 
20101217144123.697|20101217144125.522|TR0|of those unknown, really 
20101217144125.522|20101217144127.347|TR0|undisclosed and unpublicized 
20101217144127.347|20101217144129.172|TR0|killers that are the 
20101217144129.172|20101217144130.997|TR0|consequences of many 
20101217144130.997|20101217144132.822|TR0|prescription drugs.
20101217144132.822|20101217144134.647|TR0|
20101217144134.647|20101217144136.472|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: One of the 
20101217144136.472|20101217144138.297|TR0|drugs you write about is 
20101217144138.297|20101217144140.121|TR0|Celebrex, which at one point I 
20101217144140.121|20101217144141.946|TR0|think -
20101217144141.946|20101217144143.771|TR0|
20101217144143.771|20101217144145.596|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: Right.
20101217144145.596|20101217144147.421|TR0|
20101217144147.421|20101217144149.246|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: - was bringing 
20101217144149.246|20101217144151.071|TR0|in about $3.4 billion a year in 
20101217144151.071|20101217144152.896|TR0|revenue to - was it Pfizer? And 
20101217144152.896|20101217144154.721|TR0|yet, you - could you talk about 
20101217144154.721|20101217144156.546|TR0|the problems that you uncovered, 
20101217144156.546|20101217144158.371|TR0|and then, in large part, the 
20101217144158.371|20101217144200.196|TR0|drug is barely used now?
20101217144200.196|20101217144202.021|TR0|
20101217144202.021|20101217144203.846|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: It is an 
20101217144203.846|20101217144205.671|TR0|anti-inflammatory drug used 
20101217144205.671|20101217144207.496|TR0|largely for people with 
20101217144207.496|20101217144209.321|TR0|arthritis. And when many side 
20101217144209.321|20101217144211.146|TR0|effects began to occur with many 
20101217144211.146|20101217144212.971|TR0|people, what was interesting to 
20101217144212.971|20101217144214.796|TR0|us is how slow the FDA was to 
20101217144214.796|20101217144216.621|TR0|react to this. The European 
20101217144216.621|20101217144218.446|TR0|Union began pulling it off the 
20101217144218.446|20101217144220.271|TR0|shelves over there. Even the 
20101217144220.271|20101217144222.096|TR0|Saudi Arabian drug agency pulled 
20101217144222.096|20101217144223.921|TR0|- I'm sorry, that's another 
20101217144223.921|20101217144225.746|TR0|drug. But the European Union was 
20101217144225.746|20101217144227.570|TR0|one of the most instrumental in 
20101217144227.570|20101217144229.395|TR0|pulling the drug. Lawsuits began 
20101217144229.395|20101217144231.220|TR0|to be filed there and in this 
20101217144231.220|20101217144233.045|TR0|country. The FDA was very, very 
20101217144233.045|20101217144234.870|TR0|slow to react to that.
20101217144234.870|20101217144236.695|TR0|
20101217144236.695|20101217144238.520|TR0|And now, of course, this drug is 
20101217144238.520|20101217144240.345|TR0|not really much of a factor at 
20101217144240.345|20101217144242.170|TR0|all. But it's typical of how 
20101217144242.170|20101217144243.995|TR0|sometimes the rest of the world 
20101217144243.995|20101217144245.820|TR0|is much more attuned to this 
20101217144245.820|20101217144247.645|TR0|issue than we are. And that's 
20101217144247.645|20101217144249.470|TR0|largely because the FDA is just 
20101217144249.470|20101217144251.295|TR0|so much in basically the grip of 
20101217144251.295|20101217144253.120|TR0|the pharmaceutical industry. I 
20101217144253.120|20101217144254.945|TR0|mean, one of the things that we 
20101217144254.945|20101217144256.770|TR0|didn't even actually deal with 
20101217144256.770|20101217144258.595|TR0|in great detail in the story is, 
20101217144258.595|20101217144300.420|TR0|people think about the influence 
20101217144300.420|20101217144302.245|TR0|and they think about lobbying in 
20101217144302.245|20101217144304.070|TR0|this country. The lobbying isn't 
20101217144304.070|20101217144305.895|TR0|Congress. In the case of the 
20101217144305.895|20101217144307.720|TR0|pharmaceutical industry, it's 
20101217144307.720|20101217144309.545|TR0|heavily the FDA and Congress. 
20101217144309.545|20101217144311.370|TR0|And the numbers are absolutely 
20101217144311.370|20101217144313.195|TR0|staggering. It's over 200 
20101217144313.195|20101217144315.019|TR0|million a year that the industry 
20101217144315.019|20101217144316.844|TR0|shells out to lobby the agency 
20101217144316.844|20101217144318.669|TR0|and the Congress to make sure 
20101217144318.669|20101217144320.494|TR0|this system stays intact.
20101217144320.494|20101217144322.319|TR0|
20101217144322.319|20101217144324.144|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Can you give 
20101217144324.144|20101217144325.969|TR0|some examples of the drugs 
20101217144325.969|20101217144327.794|TR0|tested and where they were 
20101217144327.794|20101217144329.619|TR0|tested? You take a real global 
20101217144329.619|20101217144331.444|TR0|perspective on this.
20101217144331.444|20101217144333.269|TR0|
20101217144333.269|20101217144335.094|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: One of the ones 
20101217144335.094|20101217144336.919|TR0|that you mentioned at the 
20101217144336.919|20101217144338.744|TR0|beginning, Synflorix, was a drug 
20101217144338.744|20101217144340.569|TR0|to treat pneumonia and ear 
20101217144340.569|20101217144342.394|TR0|infections in children. This was 
20101217144342.394|20101217144344.219|TR0|treated - the clinical trial 
20101217144344.219|20101217144346.044|TR0|there was in a northern province 
20101217144346.044|20101217144347.869|TR0|in Arizona, where many of the 
20101217144347.869|20101217144349.694|TR0|parents were illiterate, where 
20101217144349.694|20101217144351.519|TR0|many of the children signed up 
20101217144351.519|20101217144353.344|TR0|at - the parents had no idea. 
20101217144353.344|20101217144355.169|TR0|They thought their children were 
20101217144355.169|20101217144356.994|TR0|actually being treated for the 
20101217144356.994|20101217144358.819|TR0|disease; they did not realize 
20101217144358.819|20101217144400.643|TR0|that it was an actual clinical 
20101217144400.643|20101217144402.468|TR0|trial. In fact, one of the local 
20101217144402.468|20101217144404.293|TR0|officials there was later found 
20101217144404.293|20101217144406.118|TR0|to be - who was conducting this, 
20101217144406.118|20101217144407.943|TR0|was later found to be, I think, 
20101217144407.943|20101217144409.768|TR0|the brother of one of the 
20101217144409.768|20101217144411.593|TR0|ministers of a particular state. 
20101217144411.593|20101217144413.418|TR0|That's one area.
20101217144413.418|20101217144415.243|TR0|
20101217144415.243|20101217144417.068|TR0|The former Soviet republics - 
20101217144417.068|20101217144418.893|TR0|Kazakhstan, for one, has been a 
20101217144418.893|20101217144420.718|TR0|real popular area. Many 
20101217144420.718|20101217144422.543|TR0|provinces in primitive areas. 
20101217144422.543|20101217144424.368|TR0|Rural areas in Romania have also 
20101217144424.368|20101217144426.193|TR0|been a real popular area. Rural 
20101217144426.193|20101217144428.018|TR0|sections of China, a couple 
20101217144428.018|20101217144429.843|TR0|provinces there have been real 
20101217144429.843|20101217144431.668|TR0|focal points of this. Extremely 
20101217144431.668|20101217144433.493|TR0|populated parts of India - New 
20101217144433.493|20101217144435.318|TR0|Delhi, for example, that I 
20101217144435.318|20101217144437.143|TR0|believe was also the test you 
20101217144437.143|20101217144438.968|TR0|mentioned earlier, that was also 
20101217144438.968|20101217144440.793|TR0|an area where folks have been 
20101217144440.793|20101217144442.618|TR0|subject to these tests. And 
20101217144442.618|20101217144444.443|TR0|what's interesting to us is how 
20101217144444.443|20101217144446.268|TR0|these things are increasingly 
20101217144446.268|20101217144448.092|TR0|spreading out. In places like 
20101217144448.092|20101217144449.917|TR0|China and India, the appeal in 
20101217144449.917|20101217144451.742|TR0|those countries is - frankly, 
20101217144451.742|20101217144453.567|TR0|it's jobs. If you're a doctor in 
20101217144453.567|20101217144455.392|TR0|one of those places, the money 
20101217144455.392|20101217144457.217|TR0|you may make from signing up 
20101217144457.217|20101217144459.042|TR0|people to take these tests may 
20101217144459.042|20101217144500.867|TR0|will exceed your annual income 
20101217144500.867|20101217144502.692|TR0|from the rest of your practice, 
20101217144502.692|20101217144504.517|TR0|so that it's a tremendous 
20101217144504.517|20101217144506.342|TR0|economic incentive in these 
20101217144506.342|20101217144508.167|TR0|countries to engage in these 
20101217144508.167|20101217144509.992|TR0|tests and to profit from them.

20101217144511.817|20101217144513.642|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Jim, were you 
20101217144513.642|20101217144515.467|TR0|able to delve into how the 
20101217144515.467|20101217144517.292|TR0|choices of these places and the 
20101217144517.292|20101217144519.117|TR0|decisions to begin trials works 
20101217144519.117|20101217144520.942|TR0|out internally within these 
20101217144520.942|20101217144522.767|TR0|companies? Do they have brokers 
20101217144522.767|20101217144524.592|TR0|or people that out there 
20101217144524.592|20101217144526.417|TR0|scouting communities that they 
20101217144526.417|20101217144528.242|TR0|can utilize? Or are they giving 
20101217144528.242|20101217144530.067|TR0|bonuses to their various 
20101217144530.067|20101217144531.892|TR0|middle-level managers to find 
20101217144531.892|20101217144533.717|TR0|places where they can do these 
20101217144533.717|20101217144535.541|TR0|trials? How does it work?
20101217144535.541|20101217144537.366|TR0|
20101217144537.366|20101217144539.191|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: That's a great 
20101217144539.191|20101217144541.016|TR0|question. And we did not get as 
20101217144541.016|20101217144542.841|TR0|deep into that as we wanted. But 
20101217144542.841|20101217144544.666|TR0|I'll tell you what we did find. 
20101217144544.666|20101217144546.491|TR0|One of the greatest changes in 
20101217144546.491|20101217144548.316|TR0|the whole clinical trials field, 
20101217144548.316|20101217144550.141|TR0|both in this country and abroad, 
20101217144550.141|20101217144551.966|TR0|is the emergence of these - what 
20101217144551.966|20101217144553.791|TR0|we call a clinical trials 
20101217144553.791|20101217144555.616|TR0|industry. It's the privatization 
20101217144555.616|20101217144557.441|TR0|of this process. It's been 
20101217144557.441|20101217144559.266|TR0|another step in the whole 
20101217144559.266|20101217144601.091|TR0|movement toward sort of free 
20101217144601.091|20101217144602.916|TR0|market medicine, where they put 
20101217144602.916|20101217144604.741|TR0|the profit motive into this part 
20101217144604.741|20101217144606.566|TR0|of it.
20101217144606.566|20101217144608.391|TR0|
20101217144608.391|20101217144610.216|TR0|In the past, so many of these 
20101217144610.216|20101217144612.041|TR0|clinical trials, both here and 
20101217144612.041|20101217144613.866|TR0|the few that were abroad, were 
20101217144613.866|20101217144615.691|TR0|conducted by, very often, 
20101217144615.691|20101217144617.516|TR0|academic institutions, medical 
20101217144617.516|20101217144619.341|TR0|schools, that conducted these. 
20101217144619.341|20101217144621.165|TR0|Increasingly in the last 10 to 
20101217144621.165|20101217144622.990|TR0|15 years, you've seen the 
20101217144622.990|20101217144624.815|TR0|emergence of this whole new 
20101217144624.815|20101217144626.640|TR0|industry, profit-making 
20101217144626.640|20101217144628.465|TR0|companies that take the jobs 
20101217144628.465|20101217144630.290|TR0|from the pharmaceutical 
20101217144630.290|20101217144632.115|TR0|companies, and they say, "We 
20101217144632.115|20101217144633.940|TR0|will set up a clinical trial for 
20101217144633.940|20101217144635.765|TR0|you in India or China or some 
20101217144635.765|20101217144637.590|TR0|place in Africa or Kazakhstan, a 
20101217144637.590|20101217144639.415|TR0|rural area of Romania. We will 
20101217144639.415|20101217144641.240|TR0|find the people. We will find 
20101217144641.240|20101217144643.065|TR0|the doctor who will conduct 
20101217144643.065|20101217144644.890|TR0|these tests. We will pay them. 
20101217144644.890|20101217144646.715|TR0|You pay us in return." Then they 
20101217144646.715|20101217144648.540|TR0|render those results back to the 
20101217144648.540|20101217144650.365|TR0|pharmaceutical company. Now, we 
20101217144650.365|20101217144652.190|TR0|did not find immediate, direct 
20101217144652.190|20101217144654.015|TR0|evidence of this, but you don't 
20101217144654.015|20101217144655.840|TR0|have to be a rocket scientist 
20101217144655.840|20101217144657.665|TR0|here to figure out that if 
20101217144657.665|20101217144659.490|TR0|you're in the privatization 
20101217144659.490|20101217144701.315|TR0|business, you're in the clinical 
20101217144701.315|20101217144703.140|TR0|trials business, you certainly 
20101217144703.140|20101217144704.965|TR0|want to deliver as favorable 
20101217144704.965|20101217144706.790|TR0|results as possible to the 
20101217144706.790|20101217144708.614|TR0|company, based on those trials 
20101217144708.614|20101217144710.439|TR0|you've conducted, or else, I 
20101217144710.439|20101217144712.264|TR0|suspect, you're not going to get 
20101217144712.264|20101217144714.089|TR0|any new jobs in those places in 
20101217144714.089|20101217144715.914|TR0|the future. So, the whole 
20101217144715.914|20101217144717.739|TR0|emergence of this has put the 
20101217144717.739|20101217144719.564|TR0|profit motive into this segment 
20101217144719.564|20101217144721.389|TR0|of healthcare and medicine, and 
20101217144721.389|20101217144723.214|TR0|it's really not healthy, because 
20101217144723.214|20101217144725.039|TR0|what you really need is an issue 
20101217144725.039|20101217144726.864|TR0|of science here, not people - 
20101217144726.864|20101217144728.689|TR0|not hedge funds, not private 
20101217144728.689|20101217144730.514|TR0|investors - trying to make a 
20101217144730.514|20101217144732.339|TR0|buck on this process.
20101217144732.339|20101217144734.164|TR0|
20101217144734.164|20101217144735.989|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I just want to - 
20101217144735.989|20101217144737.814|TR0|a quick correction. I think you 
20101217144737.814|20101217144739.639|TR0|said "Arizona" when you meant to 
20101217144739.639|20101217144741.464|TR0|say "Argentina," the testing of 
20101217144741.464|20101217144743.289|TR0|Synflorix.
20101217144743.289|20101217144745.114|TR0|
20101217144745.114|20101217144746.939|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: Argentina. 
20101217144746.939|20101217144748.764|TR0|Thank you very much. You're 
20101217144748.764|20101217144750.589|TR0|absolutely right.
20101217144750.589|20101217144752.414|TR0|
20101217144752.414|20101217144754.239|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: But finally, 
20101217144754.239|20101217144756.063|TR0|we're going to be going on to 
20101217144756.063|20101217144757.888|TR0|Sid Wolfe of Health Research 
20101217144757.888|20101217144759.713|TR0|Group, who also has just 
20101217144759.713|20101217144801.538|TR0|released a report today. But the 
20101217144801.538|20101217144803.363|TR0|remarkable figure that you have 
20101217144803.363|20101217144805.188|TR0|that - what is the number of - 
20101217144805.188|20101217144807.013|TR0|in 2008, the FDA visited only 45 
20101217144807.013|20101217144808.838|TR0|of 6,485 locations where foreign 
20101217144808.838|20101217144810.663|TR0|drug trials were being 
20101217144810.663|20101217144812.488|TR0|conducted? Forty-five of close 
20101217144812.488|20101217144814.313|TR0|to 6,500.
20101217144814.313|20101217144816.138|TR0|
20101217144816.138|20101217144817.963|TR0|>> JAMES STEELE: Seven-tenths of 
20101217144817.963|20101217144819.788|TR0|one percent of the total foreign 
20101217144819.788|20101217144821.613|TR0|trials. I mean, this - so even 
20101217144821.613|20101217144823.438|TR0|if there were the regulations, 
20101217144823.438|20101217144825.263|TR0|even the little bit they do 
20101217144825.263|20101217144827.088|TR0|doesn't go very far. And, of 
20101217144827.088|20101217144828.913|TR0|course, this is going to become 
20101217144828.913|20101217144830.738|TR0|a greater and greater problem, 
20101217144830.738|20101217144832.563|TR0|because we don't fund government 
20101217144832.563|20101217144834.388|TR0|in any of its phases in this 
20101217144834.388|20101217144836.213|TR0|country, in many cases. And they 
20101217144836.213|20101217144838.038|TR0|have not funded the FDA in this

20101217144839.863|20101217144841.687|TR0|
20101217144841.687|20101217144843.512|TR0|The other thing involved here is 
20101217144843.512|20101217144845.337|TR0|when these - in foreign trials 
20101217144845.337|20101217144847.162|TR0|and in foreign manufacturing of 
20101217144847.162|20101217144848.987|TR0|drugs, the U.S. inspectors need 
20101217144848.987|20101217144850.812|TR0|to get the approval of these 
20101217144850.812|20101217144852.637|TR0|foreign governments when they go 
20101217144852.637|20101217144854.462|TR0|into these places. And you can 
20101217144854.462|20101217144856.287|TR0|imagine what happens there. If 
20101217144856.287|20101217144858.112|TR0|somebody is tipped off, if you 
20101217144858.112|20101217144859.937|TR0|know somebody is coming, what 
20101217144859.937|20101217144901.762|TR0|kind of a normal inspection do 
20101217144901.762|20101217144903.587|TR0|you get there? So - and Joe 
20101217144903.587|20101217144905.412|TR0|Stephens mentioned this earlier 
20101217144905.412|20101217144907.237|TR0|- the U.S. is losing control of 
20101217144907.237|20101217144909.062|TR0|this process, and in many cases, 
20101217144909.062|20101217144910.887|TR0|there's not a whole lot they can 
20101217144910.887|20101217144912.712|TR0|do on this. But at the bare 
20101217144912.712|20101217144914.537|TR0|minimum, they at least need to 
20101217144914.537|20101217144916.362|TR0|have a registry, they at least 
20101217144916.362|20101217144918.187|TR0|need to know where these are, 
20101217144918.187|20101217144920.012|TR0|and they at least need to step 
20101217144920.012|20101217144921.837|TR0|up the inspections that they can 
20101217144921.837|20101217144923.662|TR0|do. But right now there's 
20101217144923.662|20101217144925.487|TR0|absolutely no will, no 
20101217144925.487|20101217144927.312|TR0|recognition of what a severe and 
20101217144927.312|20101217144929.136|TR0|really dangerous problem this is.

20101217144952.861|20101217144954.686|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: A new study by 
20101217144954.686|20101217144956.511|TR0|the watchdog group Public 
20101217144956.511|20101217144958.336|TR0|Citizen has found that the drug 
20101217144958.336|20101217145000.161|TR0|industry has become the biggest 
20101217145000.161|20101217145001.986|TR0|defrauder of the federal 
20101217145001.986|20101217145003.811|TR0|government, surpassing the 
20101217145003.811|20101217145005.636|TR0|defense industry. Public Citizen 
20101217145005.636|20101217145007.461|TR0|found that the drug industry 
20101217145007.461|20101217145009.286|TR0|paid out nearly $20 billion in 
20101217145009.286|20101217145011.111|TR0|penalties over the past two 
20101217145011.111|20101217145012.936|TR0|decades for violations of the 
20101217145012.936|20101217145014.761|TR0|False Claims Act. More than half 
20101217145014.761|20101217145016.585|TR0|of the industry's fines were 
20101217145016.585|20101217145018.410|TR0|paid by just four companies: 
20101217145018.410|20101217145020.235|TR0|GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Eli 
20101217145020.235|20101217145022.060|TR0|Lilly and Schering-Plough.

20101217145027.535|20101217145029.360|TR0|D.C., co-author of the report, 
20101217145029.360|20101217145031.185|TR0|director of Public Citizen's

20101217145034.835|20101217145036.660|TR0|Dr. Wolfe, thank you for being 
20101217145036.660|20101217145038.485|TR0|with us. Lay out your study. 
20101217145038.485|20101217145040.310|TR0|What did you find? The largest 
20101217145040.310|20101217145042.135|TR0|defrauder, even more powerful 
20101217145042.135|20101217145043.960|TR0|than the weapons industry?
20101217145043.960|20101217145045.785|TR0|
20101217145045.785|20101217145047.610|TR0|>> DR. SIDNEY WOLFE: Well, good 
20101217145047.610|20101217145049.435|TR0|morning.
20101217145049.435|20101217145051.260|TR0|
20101217145051.260|20101217145053.085|TR0|Well, it's interesting. In 1863, 
20101217145053.085|20101217145054.910|TR0|even back then, the defense 
20101217145054.910|20101217145056.735|TR0|industry was defrauding the 
20101217145056.735|20101217145058.560|TR0|federal government in contracts 
20101217145058.560|20101217145100.385|TR0|during the Civil War. They 
20101217145100.385|20101217145102.209|TR0|passed something called the 
20101217145102.209|20101217145104.034|TR0|False Claims Act back in 1863. 
20101217145104.034|20101217145105.859|TR0|And up until very recently, the 
20101217145105.859|20101217145107.684|TR0|number one defrauder has been 
20101217145107.684|20101217145109.509|TR0|the industry that caused the law 
20101217145109.509|20101217145111.334|TR0|to be passed in the first place: 
20101217145111.334|20101217145113.159|TR0|the defense industry. But back 
20101217145113.159|20101217145114.984|TR0|in the last decade or so, 
20101217145114.984|20101217145116.809|TR0|slowly, but surely, the defense 
20101217145116.809|20101217145118.634|TR0|industry has been overrun, so to 
20101217145118.634|20101217145120.459|TR0|speak, by the pharmaceutical 
20101217145120.459|20101217145122.284|TR0|industry. In fact, it's overrun 
20101217145122.284|20101217145124.109|TR0|all the other industries that 
20101217145124.109|20101217145125.934|TR0|have claims paid under the False 
20101217145125.934|20101217145127.759|TR0|Claims Act.
20101217145127.759|20101217145129.584|TR0|
20101217145129.584|20101217145131.409|TR0|And what this constitutes, in 
20101217145131.409|20101217145133.234|TR0|many cases, is just 
20101217145133.234|20101217145135.059|TR0|deliberately, maliciously 
20101217145135.059|20101217145136.884|TR0|overcharging the United States 
20101217145136.884|20101217145138.709|TR0|government through programs like 
20101217145138.709|20101217145140.534|TR0|Medicare and Medicaid and other 
20101217145140.534|20101217145142.359|TR0|kinds. We're just talking about 
20101217145142.359|20101217145144.184|TR0|the federal payments under the 
20101217145144.184|20101217145146.009|TR0|False Claims Act. Back in 2001, 
20101217145146.009|20101217145147.834|TR0|for the first time, in one year, 
20101217145147.834|20101217145149.658|TR0|the defense industry was 
20101217145149.658|20101217145151.483|TR0|overtaken by the pharmaceutical 
20101217145151.483|20101217145153.308|TR0|industry. Now, consistently for 
20101217145153.308|20101217145155.133|TR0|the last three years, the major 
20101217145155.133|20101217145156.958|TR0|violator is the pharmaceutical 
20101217145156.958|20101217145158.783|TR0|industry. And those are only 
20101217145158.783|20101217145200.608|TR0|civil penalties. In addition to 
20101217145200.608|20101217145202.433|TR0|that, this $20 billion that we 
20101217145202.433|20101217145204.258|TR0|tallied over the last 20 years 
20101217145204.258|20101217145206.083|TR0|includes a number of criminal 
20101217145206.083|20101217145207.908|TR0|penalties. The very same Pfizer 
20101217145207.908|20101217145209.733|TR0|that Joe Stephens and his 
20101217145209.733|20101217145211.558|TR0|co-workers so thoroughly 
20101217145211.558|20101217145213.383|TR0|investigated, and James Steele 
20101217145213.383|20101217145215.208|TR0|just talked about, paid the 
20101217145215.208|20101217145217.033|TR0|largest criminal fine ever in 
20101217145217.033|20101217145218.858|TR0|the United States for any 
20101217145218.858|20101217145220.683|TR0|company, for anything, back in 
20101217145220.683|20101217145222.508|TR0|2009. It was $1.2 billion for 
20101217145222.508|20101217145224.333|TR0|illegally promoting drugs that 
20101217145224.333|20101217145226.158|TR0|weren't approved for certain 
20101217145226.158|20101217145227.983|TR0|things for other things - in 
20101217145227.983|20101217145229.808|TR0|other words, illegal off-label 
20101217145229.808|20101217145231.633|TR0|promotion. So it's a combination 
20101217145231.633|20101217145233.458|TR0|of civil violations, such as the 
20101217145233.458|20101217145235.282|TR0|False Claims Act, and criminal 
20101217145235.282|20101217145237.107|TR0|violations that tallies up to 
20101217145237.107|20101217145238.932|TR0|$20 billion.
20101217145238.932|20101217145240.757|TR0|
20101217145240.757|20101217145242.582|TR0|The interesting thing is that, 
20101217145242.582|20101217145244.407|TR0|of that $20 billion, 
20101217145244.407|20101217145246.232|TR0|three-quarters of it has just 
20101217145246.232|20101217145248.057|TR0|been in the last five years. So 
20101217145248.057|20101217145249.882|TR0|what we're witnessing is an 
20101217145249.882|20101217145251.707|TR0|escalation of well-organized 
20101217145251.707|20101217145253.532|TR0|criminal and other kinds of 
20101217145253.532|20101217145255.357|TR0|legal - illegal activity by the 
20101217145255.357|20101217145257.182|TR0|pharmaceutical industry. Why are 
20101217145257.182|20101217145259.007|TR0|they doing this? Well, one 
20101217145259.007|20101217145300.832|TR0|reason is that they have a 
20101217145300.832|20101217145302.657|TR0|pretty empty pipeline in terms 
20101217145302.657|20101217145304.482|TR0|of new drugs, important new 
20101217145304.482|20101217145306.307|TR0|drugs. And so, in order to keep 
20101217145306.307|20101217145308.132|TR0|up their extraordinarily high 
20101217145308.132|20101217145309.957|TR0|profit margin, what they've done 
20101217145309.957|20101217145311.782|TR0|is overcharged the government 
20101217145311.782|20101217145313.607|TR0|illegally - they are the number 
20101217145313.607|20101217145315.432|TR0|one False Claims violator  -- 
20101217145315.432|20101217145317.257|TR0|and, increasingly, illegally 
20101217145317.257|20101217145319.082|TR0|promote drugs for off-label use. 
20101217145319.082|20101217145320.907|TR0|This can be a danger to the 
20101217145320.907|20101217145322.731|TR0|public health, because if you 
20101217145322.731|20101217145324.556|TR0|have a drug that you don't have 
20101217145324.556|20101217145326.381|TR0|evidence that its benefits 
20101217145326.381|20101217145328.206|TR0|outweigh its risks, you may well 
20101217145328.206|20101217145330.031|TR0|be endangering people's lives, 
20101217145330.031|20101217145331.856|TR0|which is why criminal penalties 
20101217145331.856|20101217145333.681|TR0|affix themselves to these kinds 
20101217145333.681|20101217145335.506|TR0|of violations. So, this industry 
20101217145335.506|20101217145337.331|TR0| --
20101217145337.331|20101217145339.156|TR0|
20101217145339.156|20101217145340.981|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Give us examples.
20101217145340.981|20101217145342.806|TR0|
20101217145342.806|20101217145344.631|TR0|>> DR. SIDNEY WOLFE: - aside 
20101217145344.631|20101217145346.456|TR0|from what we've just heard, 
20101217145346.456|20101217145348.281|TR0|which - in terms of human 
20101217145348.281|20101217145350.106|TR0|experimentation, is a major 
20101217145350.106|20101217145351.931|TR0|violator of both criminal and 
20101217145351.931|20101217145353.756|TR0|civil laws in the United States.
20101217145353.756|20101217145355.581|TR0|
20101217145355.581|20101217145357.406|TR0|I'd just like to add something 
20101217145357.406|20101217145359.231|TR0|to what James Steele said, which 
20101217145359.231|20101217145401.056|TR0|is, we call this industry the 
20101217145401.056|20101217145402.881|TR0|human experimentation 
20101217145402.881|20101217145404.706|TR0|corporations. The biggest human 
20101217145404.706|20101217145406.531|TR0|experimentation corporation is 
20101217145406.531|20101217145408.356|TR0|right here in the United States. 
20101217145408.356|20101217145410.180|TR0|It's called Quintiles. They do 
20101217145410.180|20101217145412.005|TR0|experiments for drug companies 
20101217145412.005|20101217145413.830|TR0|as quickly as they possibly can 
20101217145413.830|20101217145415.655|TR0|all over the world. We found an 
20101217145415.655|20101217145417.480|TR0|ad from Quintiles that sells to 
20101217145417.480|20101217145419.305|TR0|the drug industry: "We help you 
20101217145419.305|20101217145421.130|TR0|recruit drug-naive subjects in 
20101217145421.130|20101217145422.955|TR0|many developing countries." So 
20101217145422.955|20101217145424.780|TR0|this industry, in terms of 
20101217145424.780|20101217145426.605|TR0|exporting human experiments - 
20101217145426.605|20101217145428.430|TR0|and it really is a business - in 
20101217145428.430|20101217145430.255|TR0|terms of criminal violations - 
20101217145430.255|20101217145432.080|TR0|off-label marketing, illegal - 
20101217145432.080|20101217145433.905|TR0|in terms of False Claims Act, is 
20101217145433.905|20101217145435.730|TR0|really at the forefront. They 
20101217145435.730|20101217145437.555|TR0|parade themselves - and they do 
20101217145437.555|20101217145439.380|TR0|some good things; they do 
20101217145439.380|20101217145441.205|TR0|develop some good drugs. Is it 
20101217145441.205|20101217145443.030|TR0|really necessary for them to 
20101217145443.030|20101217145444.855|TR0|engage in criminal behavior, in 
20101217145444.855|20101217145446.680|TR0|civil violations and in very 
20101217145446.680|20101217145448.505|TR0|unethical human experimentations 
20101217145448.505|20101217145450.330|TR0|around the world? We think the 
20101217145450.330|20101217145452.155|TR0|answer is no.
20101217145452.155|20101217145453.980|TR0|
20101217145453.980|20101217145455.804|TR0|A top lawyer at the FDA has 
20101217145455.804|20101217145457.629|TR0|recently said, "The only way 
20101217145457.629|20101217145459.454|TR0|we're going to stop this 
20101217145459.454|20101217145501.279|TR0|industry from violating these 
20101217145501.279|20101217145503.104|TR0|laws, endangering people, is to 
20101217145503.104|20101217145504.929|TR0|start putting people in jail." 
20101217145504.929|20101217145506.754|TR0|No one has ever gone to jail 
20101217145506.754|20101217145508.579|TR0|from one of these drug companies 
20101217145508.579|20101217145510.404|TR0|for these criminal violations. 
20101217145510.404|20101217145512.229|TR0|The size of the penalties is 
20101217145512.229|20101217145514.054|TR0|miniscule compared with the 
20101217145514.054|20101217145515.879|TR0|profits. Two companies, as 
20101217145515.879|20101217145517.704|TR0|mentioned - Glaxo and Pfizer 
20101217145517.704|20101217145519.529|TR0|alone - have paid $7 billion or 
20101217145519.529|20101217145521.354|TR0|$8 billion in the last 20 years. 
20101217145521.354|20101217145523.179|TR0|In one year, those two companies 
20101217145523.179|20101217145525.004|TR0|make about $15 billion or $16 
20101217145525.004|20101217145526.829|TR0|billion in profits. So, until 
20101217145526.829|20101217145528.654|TR0|they are adequately assessed 
20101217145528.654|20101217145530.479|TR0|penalties that compare with the 
20101217145530.479|20101217145532.304|TR0|amount of money they've made off 
20101217145532.304|20101217145534.129|TR0|of these various drugs, until 
20101217145534.129|20101217145535.954|TR0|people are put in jail, if 
20101217145535.954|20101217145537.779|TR0|appropriate, this industry is 
20101217145537.779|20101217145539.604|TR0|going to keep running away.
20101217145539.604|20101217145541.429|TR0|
20101217145541.429|20101217145543.253|TR0|And one other thing that was 
20101217145543.253|20101217145545.078|TR0|alluded to by James Steele is, 
20101217145545.078|20101217145546.903|TR0|this industry directly finances 
20101217145546.903|20101217145548.728|TR0|the FDA through cash payments. 
20101217145548.728|20101217145550.553|TR0|This year, between $700 million 
20101217145550.553|20101217145552.378|TR0|and $800 million in cash goes 
20101217145552.378|20101217145554.203|TR0|directly from the drug industry 
20101217145554.203|20101217145556.028|TR0|to the FDA. It pays for about 
20101217145556.028|20101217145557.853|TR0|two-thirds of all the review of 
20101217145557.853|20101217145559.678|TR0|drugs. So, in addition to the 
20101217145559.678|20101217145601.503|TR0|lobbying, the $200 million that 
20101217145601.503|20101217145603.328|TR0|James Steele talked about, there 
20101217145603.328|20101217145605.153|TR0|are direct cash payments, under 
20101217145605.153|20101217145606.978|TR0|a 1992 law that the Congress 
20101217145606.978|20101217145608.803|TR0|unwisely passed. So w have lots 
20101217145608.803|20101217145610.628|TR0|of problems with this industry. 
20101217145610.628|20101217145612.453|TR0|It does a lot of good things, 
20101217145612.453|20101217145614.278|TR0|but it is increasingly a menace 
20101217145614.278|20101217145616.103|TR0|in this country and abroad. As 
20101217145616.103|20101217145617.928|TR0|part of globalization, we've 
20101217145617.928|20101217145619.753|TR0|globalized human 
20101217145619.753|20101217145621.578|TR0|experimentation, and it's a 
20101217145621.578|20101217145623.403|TR0|pretty nasty business.
20101217145623.403|20101217145625.228|TR0|
20101217145625.228|20101217145627.053|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, Sid 
20101217145627.053|20101217145628.878|TR0|Wolfe, precisely I wanted to ask 
20101217145628.878|20101217145630.702|TR0|you about this issue, that since 
20101217145630.702|20101217145632.527|TR0|they've had so many criminal 
20101217145632.527|20101217145634.352|TR0|penalties imposed upon them, as 
20101217145634.352|20101217145636.177|TR0|well as the civil cases, we're 
20101217145636.177|20101217145638.002|TR0|dealing essentially with a 
20101217145638.002|20101217145639.827|TR0|handful of companies that are 
20101217145639.827|20101217145641.652|TR0|predicate felons in some degree, 
20101217145641.652|20101217145643.477|TR0|yet none of their individual 
20101217145643.477|20101217145645.302|TR0|executives, as you say, ever go 
20101217145645.302|20101217145647.127|TR0|to jail, or there's no call to 
20101217145647.127|20101217145648.952|TR0|break up some of these 
20101217145648.952|20101217145650.777|TR0|companies. What can be done, 
20101217145650.777|20101217145652.602|TR0|what can the public do, in terms 
20101217145652.602|20101217145654.427|TR0|of putting pressure on the 
20101217145654.427|20101217145656.252|TR0|members of Congress to try to 
20101217145656.252|20101217145658.077|TR0|reform this system?
20101217145658.077|20101217145659.902|TR0|
20101217145659.902|20101217145701.727|TR0|>> DR. SIDNEY WOLFE: Well, 
20101217145701.727|20101217145703.552|TR0|certainly, there's been a 
20101217145703.552|20101217145705.377|TR0|terribly dangerous lack of 
20101217145705.377|20101217145707.202|TR0|congressional oversight over the 
20101217145707.202|20101217145709.027|TR0|FDA. Twenty-five years ago, one 
20101217145709.027|20101217145710.852|TR0|congressional committee, Senator 
20101217145710.852|20101217145712.677|TR0|Gaylord Nelson's Senate Small 
20101217145712.677|20101217145714.502|TR0|Business Subcommittee, held 130 
20101217145714.502|20101217145716.326|TR0|days of hearings on the drug 
20101217145716.326|20101217145718.151|TR0|industry and the FDA in about a 
20101217145718.151|20101217145719.976|TR0|10-year period. That is five or 
20101217145719.976|20101217145721.801|TR0|10 times more hearings than all 
20101217145721.801|20101217145723.626|TR0|the rest of the Congresses has 
20101217145723.626|20101217145725.451|TR0|had recently. So Congress 
20101217145725.451|20101217145727.276|TR0|certainly needs to step up 
20101217145727.276|20101217145729.101|TR0|oversight.
20101217145729.101|20101217145730.926|TR0|
20101217145730.926|20101217145732.751|TR0|People need to support someone 
20101217145732.751|20101217145734.576|TR0|named Eric Blumberg. People 
20101217145734.576|20101217145736.401|TR0|probably have never heard of 
20101217145736.401|20101217145738.226|TR0|him. He's the top litigator in 
20101217145738.226|20101217145740.051|TR0|the FDA. He gave a speech two 
20101217145740.051|20101217145741.876|TR0|months ago to drug industry and 
20101217145741.876|20101217145743.701|TR0|FDA lawyers, saying, "These 
20101217145743.701|20101217145745.526|TR0|companies are getting away with 
20101217145745.526|20101217145747.351|TR0|really dangerous activities. The 
20101217145747.351|20101217145749.176|TR0|only way we're going to do 
20101217145749.176|20101217145751.001|TR0|something" - and he pledged to 
20101217145751.001|20101217145752.826|TR0|be part of this drive - "is to 
20101217145752.826|20101217145754.651|TR0|increase greatly the size of the 
20101217145754.651|20101217145756.476|TR0|penalties these companies have 
20101217145756.476|20101217145758.301|TR0|to pay and, when it's 
20101217145758.301|20101217145800.126|TR0|appropriate, start putting 
20101217145800.126|20101217145801.951|TR0|people in jail." He was 
20101217145801.951|20101217145803.775|TR0|attacked, obviously, by the drug 
20101217145803.775|20101217145805.600|TR0|industry for saying these 
20101217145805.600|20101217145807.425|TR0|things. He's absolutely right, 
20101217145807.425|20101217145809.250|TR0|and he needs to be supported. 
20101217145809.250|20101217145811.075|TR0|He's in a position to do it. 
20101217145811.075|20101217145812.900|TR0|He's the top litigating lawyer 
20101217145812.900|20101217145814.725|TR0|in the Food and Drug
