20101230070536.000|20101230070538.000|CC1|BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES YOU LIMIT
20101230070538.000|20101230070541.000|CC1|YOURSELF BY PAINTING A PICTURE

20101230070542.000|20101230070543.000|CC1|FOR ME, I THOUGHT FAMILY LIFE   
20101230070543.000|20101230070548.000|CC1|WAS HUSBAND, HOMES SURROUNDING, 
20101230070548.000|20101230070549.000|CC1|EVERYTHING FUNCTIONING IN A

20101230070550.000|20101230070552.000|CC1|THEN THE BABY COMES, AND FOR    
20101230070552.000|20101230070555.000|CC1|ME, IT JUST WAS NOT GOING TO    
20101230070555.000|20101230070557.000|CC1|HAPPEN THAT WAY.                
20101230070557.000|20101230070559.000|CC1|I FEEL LIKE CREATING AN         
20101230070559.000|20101230070600.000|CC1|EXPANSION WAS ABOUT LETTING GO  
20101230070600.000|20101230070602.000|CC1|OF THE IDEA OF WHAT THE FAMILY  
20101230070602.000|20101230070603.000|CC1|HAD TO LOOK LIKE.               
20101230070603.000|20101230070604.000|CC1|I DID NOT GET MARRIED BEFORE I  
20101230070604.000|20101230070610.000|CC1|HAD MY KIDS, AND I DID NOT GO TO
20101230070610.000|20101230070611.000|CC1|THE SPERM BANK BECAUSE I FEEL   
20101230070611.000|20101230070613.000|CC1|LIKE THERE ARE SO MANY CHILDREN

20101230070929.000|20101230070931.000|CC1|AND WHAT IT IS THAT THEY

20101230071530.000|20101230071533.000|CC1|YEARS LATER, HE WAS THE FIRST   
20101230071533.000|20101230071534.000|CC1|PERSON TO REALLY GIVE ME MY     
20101230071534.000|20101230071537.000|CC1|FIRST GIG.                      
20101230071537.000|20101230071540.000|CC1|BUT MORE THAN THAT, I AM LUCKY  
20101230071540.000|20101230071542.000|CC1|THAT I GOT TO STAND ON THE SIDE 
20101230071542.000|20101230071543.000|CC1|OF THE STAGE AND WATCH HIM A    
20101230071543.000|20101230071546.000|CC1|FINE TO ME WHAT DIVINITY IS.    
20101230071546.000|20101230071548.000|CC1|I THINK INSPIRATION IS SOMETHING
20101230071548.000|20101230071549.000|CC1|THAT WE CANNOT PUT A DEFINITION 
20101230071549.000|20101230071550.000|CC1|ON IT.                          
20101230071550.000|20101230071551.000|CC1|WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE IT    
20101230071551.000|20101230071552.000|CC1|COMES FROM.                     
20101230071552.000|20101230071554.000|CC1|THE ONLY THING WE UNDERSTAND IS 
20101230071554.000|20101230071556.000|CC1|WHEN WE GET OUT OF OUR OWN WAY, 
20101230071556.000|20101230071557.000|CC1|THAT IS WHEN THE BEST OF US IS  
20101230071557.000|20101230071559.000|CC1|RELEASED AND WE LOOK AT IT AND  
20101230071559.000|20101230071601.000|CC1|GO, I DON'T KNOW HOW I CREATED  
20101230071601.000|20101230071604.000|CC1|THAT, BUT HERE IT IS.           
20101230071604.000|20101230071605.000|CC1|THERE'S SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL  
20101230071605.000|20101230071606.000|CC1|ABOUT HIM.                      
20101230071606.000|20101230071608.000|CC1|I MISS KNOWING THAT HE IS ON THE
20101230071608.000|20101230071611.000|CC1|PLANET AND HE IS MAKING MUSIC.  
20101230071611.000|20101230071612.000|CC1|THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST   
20101230071612.000|20101230071615.000|CC1|FELT RIGHT ABOUT HIM, EVEN IN   
20101230071615.000|20101230071616.000|CC1|THE YEARS OF SCRUTINY AND       
20101230071616.000|20101230071618.000|CC1|SPECULATION.                    
20101230071618.000|20101230071620.000|CC1|THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIM THAT 
20101230071620.000|20101230071624.000|CC1|WE ALL COULD RELATE TO AND THAT 
20101230071624.000|20101230071627.000|CC1|MADE US BELIEVE IN SOMETHING.   
20101230071627.000|20101230071630.000|CC1|TAVIS: I THOUGHT A SECOND AGO TO
20101230071630.000|20101230071633.000|CC1|ASK ONE QUESTION, AND I WANT TO 
20101230071633.000|20101230071634.000|CC1|ASK THE IN VERSE.               
20101230071634.000|20101230071638.000|CC1|WHAT I WANTED TO ASK WAS A      
20101230071638.000|20101230071640.000|CC1|TYPICAL QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IT  
20101230071640.000|20101230071642.000|CC1|IS THAT YOU LEARN FROM WATCHING 
20101230071642.000|20101230071643.000|CC1|A GENIUS LIKE MICHAEL AT WORK,  
20101230071643.000|20101230071646.000|CC1|THE GREATEST ENTERTAINER OF OUR 
20101230071646.000|20101230071647.000|CC1|TIME, MAYBE ALL TIME.           
20101230071647.000|20101230071648.000|CC1|WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE ABLE TO   
20101230071648.000|20101230071650.000|CC1|WATCH THIS GUY WORKED FROM THE  
20101230071650.000|20101230071651.000|CC1|SIDE OF THE STAGE.              
20101230071651.000|20101230071654.000|CC1|I COULD ASK THAT, BUT I WANT TO 
20101230071654.000|20101230071655.000|CC1|ASK, INSTEAD, WHEN YOU ARE      
20101230071655.000|20101230071657.000|CC1|WORKING WITH THAT LEVEL OF      
20101230071657.000|20101230071659.000|CC1|GENIUS, WHEN YOU ARE WORKING    
20101230071659.000|20101230071701.000|CC1|WITH THE ENTERTAINER OF ALL     
20101230071701.000|20101230071703.000|CC1|ENTERTAINERS, WHAT IS IT IN YOU 
20101230071703.000|20101230071705.000|CC1|THAT SAYS I CAN DO THIS?        
20101230071705.000|20101230071708.000|CC1|I CAN HEADLINE MY OWN SHOW?     
20101230071708.000|20101230071711.000|CC1|I GUESS MY POINT IS, IT CAN BE  
20101230071711.000|20101230071712.000|CC1|INSPIRING, BUT CAN ALSO BE      
20101230071712.000|20101230071713.000|CC1|INTIMIDATING.                   
20101230071713.000|20101230071715.000|CC1|>> IT WAS.                      
20101230071715.000|20101230071717.000|CC1|I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTOOD THE  
20101230071717.000|20101230071719.000|CC1|MAGNITUDE OF IT UNTIL I REALIZED
20101230071719.000|20101230071722.000|CC1|THAT THIS IS HEAVY AND IT       
20101230071722.000|20101230071723.000|CC1|STARTED TO WORK AGAINST ME AND I
20101230071723.000|20101230071724.000|CC1|LOST A LOT OF CONFIDENCE.       
20101230071724.000|20101230071727.000|CC1|I LOOK BACK ON IT AND WISH I    
20101230071727.000|20101230071728.000|CC1|COULD BE WHO I AM NOW, KNOWING  
20101230071728.000|20101230071731.000|CC1|WHAT I KNOW, AND STEP INTO      
20101230071731.000|20101230071734.000|CC1|THAT, BUT THAT IS NOT HOW THOSE 
20101230071734.000|20101230071736.000|CC1|THINGS ARE STRUCTURED FOR YOU TO
20101230071736.000|20101230071737.000|CC1|LEARN.                          
20101230071737.000|20101230071739.000|CC1|TAVIS: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU LOST
20101230071739.000|20101230071740.000|CC1|CONFIDENCE?                     
20101230071740.000|20101230071743.000|CC1|>> AS SOON AS YOU ENTER THE     
20101230071743.000|20101230071745.000|CC1|PUBLIC EYE, THERE ARE A         
20101230071745.000|20101230071746.000|CC1|MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE, OUT OF     
20101230071746.000|20101230071748.000|CC1|JEALOUSY OR WHATEVER OR DISLIKE 
20101230071748.000|20101230071752.000|CC1|OR WHATEVER, WILL CRITICIZE YOU.
20101230071752.000|20101230071753.000|CC1|HE LEARNED TO IGNORE IT OR NOT  
20101230071753.000|20101230071756.000|CC1|READ INTO IT, BUT AT THAT -- YOU
20101230071756.000|20101230071758.000|CC1|LEARN TO IGNORE IT OR NOT READ  
20101230071758.000|20101230071800.000|CC1|INTO IT, BUT AT THAT POINT TIME 
20101230071800.000|20101230071802.000|CC1|I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT.      
20101230071802.000|20101230071803.000|CC1|AND THE POLITICS THAT GO ALONG  
20101230071803.000|20101230071805.000|CC1|WITH HAVING SUCH A HIGH         
20101230071805.000|20101230071806.000|CC1|POSITION.                       
20101230071806.000|20101230071808.000|CC1|ULTIMATELY FOR ME, I THINK THE  
20101230071808.000|20101230071812.000|CC1|LEARNING CURVE AND THE GROWTH   
20101230071812.000|20101230071816.000|CC1|CAME OUT OF NOT JUST WATCHING   
20101230071816.000|20101230071817.000|CC1|THE BRILLIANCE OF WHAT HE COULD 
20101230071817.000|20101230071820.000|CC1|DO AND HOW HE PERFORMED EVERY   
20101230071820.000|20101230071823.000|CC1|NIGHT AND HOW HE WAS INVOLVED IN
20101230071823.000|20101230071823.000|CC1|THE PRODUCTION AND CHOREOGRAPHY 
20101230071823.000|20101230071826.000|CC1|AND EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT IT WAS 
20101230071826.000|20101230071829.000|CC1|WITNESSING HOW PEOPLE -- HOW HE 
20101230071829.000|20101230071831.000|CC1|COULD BE PRESENT FOR THE PEOPLE.
20101230071831.000|20101230071834.000|CC1|NOW THAT I AM TAURINE, I DON'T  
20101230071834.000|20101230071836.000|CC1|THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT    
20101230071836.000|20101230071838.000|CC1|UNTIL YOU STAND IN FRONT OF AN  
20101230071838.000|20101230071839.000|CC1|AUDIENCE AND YOU SEE THEIR EYES 
20101230071839.000|20101230071841.000|CC1|AND MAKE THE CONNECTION THAT IS 
20101230071841.000|20101230071842.000|CC1|A REAL CONNECTION.              
20101230071842.000|20101230071844.000|CC1|THERE ARE VERY FEW ARTISTS THAT 
20101230071844.000|20101230071847.000|CC1|I FEEL LIKE, WHEN THEY STEP OUT,
20101230071847.000|20101230071848.000|CC1|THEY ARE THERE FOR THE PEOPLE,  
20101230071848.000|20101230071850.000|CC1|NOT JUST THERE BECAUSE THEY DO A
20101230071850.000|20101230071851.000|CC1|GOOD JOB OF IT.                 
20101230071851.000|20101230071853.000|CC1|HE WAS DIFFERENT IN THAT WAY.   
20101230071853.000|20101230071855.000|CC1|I THINK HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE IN 
20101230071855.000|20101230071857.000|CC1|EVERY AREA OF HIS LIFE EXCEPT   
20101230071857.000|20101230071859.000|CC1|THAT AREA.                      
20101230071859.000|20101230071901.000|CC1|HAVING TOWARD 16 YEARS, --      
20101230071901.000|20101230071905.000|CC1|HAVING TOURED 16 YEARS, IF I    
20101230071905.000|20101230071907.000|CC1|CANNOT SEE THE AUDIENCE, IT DOES
20101230071907.000|20101230071908.000|CC1|NOT HAVE THE MEANINGFUL         
20101230071908.000|20101230071911.000|CC1|CONNECTION TIMED JUST PLAYING   
20101230071911.000|20101230071913.000|CC1|AND COLLECTING THE CHECK.       
20101230071913.000|20101230071918.000|CC1|TAVIS: HENCE, THE BONUS TRACK ON
20101230071918.000|20101230071923.000|CC1|THE CD IS, "I WANT YOUR BACKED."
20101230071923.000|20101230071929.000|CC1|-- I WANT YOU BACK."            
20101230071929.000|20101230071932.000|CC1|>> THE RHYTHM TRACK WAS SO      
20101230071932.000|20101230071935.000|CC1|SIMILAR TO A SONG BY MARVIN GAYE
20101230071935.000|20101230071936.000|CC1|THAT I JUST.

20101230071937.000|20101230071937.000|CC1|FOLLOWED.                       
20101230071937.000|20101230071940.000|CC1|THEY SAID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.  
20101230071940.000|20101230071942.000|CC1|TAVIS: DOES THAT HAPPEN OFTEN,  
20101230071942.000|20101230071943.000|CC1|THE BAND TALK YOU INTO          
20101230071943.000|20101230071944.000|CC1|SOMETHING?                      
20101230071944.000|20101230071947.000|CC1|>> NOBODY TELLS ME WHAT TO DO.  
20101230071947.000|20101230071949.000|CC1|TAVIS: EXCEPT THE BAND?         
20101230071949.000|20101230071955.000|CC1|>> I SAID, NO, I CANNOT DO THAT.
20101230071955.000|20101230071957.000|CC1|IT WAS A YEAR TO THAT           
20101230071957.000|20101230071959.000|CC1|ANNIVERSARY, ALMOST TO THE DAY. 
20101230071959.000|20101230072001.000|CC1|HE WAS MY FIRST EMPLOYER, AND   
20101230072001.000|20101230072003.000|CC1|THERE WERE TOO MANY STRONG      
20101230072003.000|20101230072005.000|CC1|CONNECTIONS TO SAY, WELL, WHO   
20101230072005.000|20101230072007.000|CC1|CARES WHAT PEOPLE SAY.

20101230072010.000|20101230072013.000|CC1|FIRST RECORD WAS "ABC," TAKE ME 
20101230072013.000|20101230072016.000|CC1|BACK THOSE YEARS AGO, WHAT DO   
20101230072016.000|20101230072018.000|CC1|YOU RECALL ABOUT GETTING THAT

20101230072019.000|20101230072022.000|CC1|>> I WAS THE THIRD OF FOUR KIDS,
20101230072022.000|20101230072024.000|CC1|SO MY OLDER SISTERS HAD RECORD  
20101230072024.000|20101230072026.000|CC1|COLLECTIONS BEFORE I DID.       
20101230072026.000|20101230072027.000|CC1|TO ACTUALLY HAVE A RECORD THAT

20101230072142.000|20101230072143.000|CC1|DRIVING EVERY NIGHT, GETTING UP 
20101230072143.000|20101230072146.000|CC1|AND DOING THE SAME THING.       
20101230072146.000|20101230072147.000|CC1|IT WAS REALLY TIRING AND I LOST 
20101230072147.000|20101230072151.000|CC1|MY PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHAT I WAS 
20101230072151.000|20101230072154.000|CC1|DOING AND WHY I WAS DOING IT.   
20101230072154.000|20101230072155.000|CC1|BUT A LOT OF YOUNG ARTISTS      
20101230072155.000|20101230072157.000|CC1|SUFFER FROM THAT AN ABILITY TO

20101230072219.000|20101230072221.000|CC1|IT WOULD BE A REAL DISTRACTION  
20101230072221.000|20101230072223.000|CC1|FOR ME TO LOCK EYES WITH
