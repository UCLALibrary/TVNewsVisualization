20101230010614.000|20101230010616.000|CC1|AND THEN PLACED THE GUN TO HIS

20101230010619.000|20101230010620.000|CC1|THAT HE WRAPPED THE SLIDE BACK, 
20101230010620.000|20101230010621.000|CC1|START AT THE BEGINNING.         
20101230010621.000|20101230010623.000|CC1|>> HERE IS THE WEAPON.          
20101230010623.000|20101230010626.000|CC1|THERE WOULD BE ONE OF TWO WITH  
20101230010626.000|20101230010628.000|CC1|WAYS THAT HE WOULD LIKELY TO DO 
20101230010628.000|20101230010628.000|CC1|IT.                             
20101230010628.000|20101230010630.000|CC1|HE WOULD GRAB THE SLIDE HERE AND
20101230010630.000|20101230010632.000|CC1|RACK IT BACK, THAT WOULD CHAMBER
20101230010632.000|20101230010633.000|CC1|A ROUND.                        
20101230010633.000|20101230010634.000|CC1|THIS IS A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT  
20101230010634.000|20101230010635.000|CC1|SOUND UNLOADED THAN IT DOES     
20101230010635.000|20101230010636.000|CC1|LOADED.                         
20101230010636.000|20101230010637.000|CC1|THE OTHER WAY HE MAY DO THAT IS 
20101230010637.000|20101230010639.000|CC1|TO COKE THE GUN HERE, PULL THE  
20101230010639.000|20101230010641.000|CC1|SLIDE BACK, AND CHAMBER THE     
20101230010641.000|20101230010641.000|CC1|ROUND.                          
20101230010641.000|20101230010644.000|CC1|NOW, IF THERE WERE A BULLET IN  
20101230010644.000|20101230010645.000|CC1|THERE, THERE WOULD BE A MECHANIC
20101230010645.000|20101230010647.000|CC1|THAT THE SLIDE WOULD DRAG THE   
20101230010647.000|20101230010650.000|CC1|BULLET INTO THAT CHAMBER, INTO  
20101230010650.000|20101230010652.000|CC1|THE BARREL.                     
20101230010652.000|20101230010654.000|CC1|AND IT WOULD FEEL COMPLETELY    
20101230010654.000|20101230010656.000|CC1|DIFFERENT THAN IT DOES UNLOADED.
20101230010656.000|20101230010658.000|CC1|>> YOU'RE SAYING THAT WHEN YOU  
20101230010658.000|20101230010701.000|CC1|RACK THE SLIDE BACK AND COCK    
20101230010701.000|20101230010702.000|CC1|THAT GUN, YOU KNOW RIGHT THEN   
20101230010702.000|20101230010704.000|CC1|AND THERE IF THAT GUN IS LOADED 
20101230010704.000|20101230010706.000|CC1|OR IF IT ISN'T LOADED, BY THE   
20101230010706.000|20101230010706.000|CC1|FEEL?

20101230010709.000|20101230010711.000|CC1|KNOWS THE FEELING.              
20101230010711.000|20101230010712.000|CC1|IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE,  
20101230010712.000|20101230010714.000|CC1|IN WEIGHT, WHEN THE GUN IS      
20101230010714.000|20101230010718.000|CC1|LOADED THAN WHEN IT'S NOT       
20101230010718.000|20101230010718.000|CC1|LOADED.                         
20101230010718.000|20101230010720.000|CC1|WHEN YOU CHAMBER THE GUN IN A   
20101230010720.000|20101230010722.000|CC1|LOADED GUN IS A METALLIC SOUND. 
20101230010722.000|20101230010723.000|CC1|THERE'S NO MECHANISM OF ENGAGING
20101230010723.000|20101230010724.000|CC1|THAT BULLET INTO THE BARREL.    
20101230010724.000|20101230010725.000|CC1|IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY DEFERENT.    
20101230010725.000|20101230010727.000|CC1|ANY EXPERT WOULD KNOW THE

20101230010728.000|20101230010730.000|CC1|HE WAS DOING, HANDLING THAT GUN.

20101230011710.000|20101230011713.000|CC1|I WOULD THEN DISENGAGE THIS.    
20101230011713.000|20101230011715.000|CC1|NOW, THAT WOULD LOAD AND CHAMBER
20101230011715.000|20101230011716.000|CC1|A BULLET.                       
20101230011716.000|20101230011718.000|CC1|IF THE MAGAZINE IS EMPTY,       
20101230011718.000|20101230011721.000|CC1|INTERESTING ENOUGH, WHEN I BRING
20101230011721.000|20101230011725.000|CC1|THE SLIDE BACK IT LOCKS INTO    
20101230011725.000|20101230011726.000|CC1|PLACE.                          
20101230011726.000|20101230011728.000|CC1|SO MOST EVERY SEMIAUTOMATIC     
20101230011728.000|20101230011730.000|CC1|PISTOL THAT I'M AWARE OF        
20101230011730.000|20101230011731.000|CC1|OPERATES IN THIS FASHION.       
20101230011731.000|20101230011732.000|CC1|>> ALL RIGHT.                   
20101230011732.000|20101230011733.000|CC1|HERE'S MY QUESTION.             
20101230011733.000|20101230011735.000|CC1|IS THERE ANY WAY THAT LATENT    
20101230011735.000|20101230011738.000|CC1|PRINTS THAT YOU CAN FIND ON THAT
20101230011738.000|20101230011739.000|CC1|GUN, NOT ONLY FROM PULLING THE  
20101230011739.000|20101230011741.000|CC1|TRIGGER, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T SAY 
20101230011741.000|20101230011742.000|CC1|THAT IN THE PROBABLE CAUSE      
20101230011742.000|20101230011744.000|CC1|AFFIDAVIT, THAT HE PULLED       
20101230011744.000|20101230011746.000|CC1|TRIGGER, BUT CAN YOU FIND ANY   
20101230011746.000|20101230011749.000|CC1|PRINTS FROM WHEN THE GUN WAS    
20101230011749.000|20101230011750.000|CC1|LOADED?                         
20101230011750.000|20101230011751.000|CC1|AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T TELL THE   
20101230011751.000|20101230011753.000|CC1|AGE OF THEM, BUT COULD THAT HELP
20101230011753.000|20101230011756.000|CC1|TO SHOW THAT HE LOADED THE GUN? 
20101230011756.000|20101230011759.000|CC1|>> YEAH, BUT AT WHAT TIME DID   
20101230011759.000|20101230011759.000|CC1|HE?                             
20101230011759.000|20101230011800.000|CC1|SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HE   
20101230011800.000|20101230011802.000|CC1|LOADED IT, UNLOADED IT, PERHAPS.
20101230011802.000|20101230011804.000|CC1|BUT I THINK THE CASE IS GOING TO
20101230011804.000|20101230011807.000|CC1|BE SOLVED, BALLISTICALLY, AND   
20101230011807.000|20101230011807.000|CC1|FORENSICALLY.                   
20101230011807.000|20101230011809.000|CC1|HE'S GOT A STORY.               
20101230011809.000|20101230011812.000|CC1|FORENSICALLY, THE BALLISTICS    
20101230011812.000|20101230011813.000|CC1|EXPERTS ARE GOING TO TRY TO     
20101230011813.000|20101230011815.000|CC1|MATCH UP THAT STORY, AND IF THAT
20101230011815.000|20101230011817.000|CC1|DOESN'T JIVE, YOU'VE GOT A BIG  
20101230011817.000|20101230011817.000|CC1|PROBLEM.                        
20101230011817.000|20101230011820.000|CC1|>> BUT IF YOU CAN FIND THAT HE  
20101230011820.000|20101230011821.000|CC1|PURCHASED SOME BULLETS, WHICH IN
20101230011821.000|20101230011823.000|CC1|MANY CASES YOU FIND THAT AND    
20101230011823.000|20101230011824.000|CC1|THEN YOU FIND THE RECEIPT AND   
20101230011824.000|20101230011827.000|CC1|YOU CORROBORATE THAT WITH SOME  
20101230011827.000|20101230011829.000|CC1|LATENT PRINTS THAT YOU FOUND,   
20101230011829.000|20101230011830.000|CC1|YOU ARE BUILDING A              
20101230011830.000|20101230011832.000|CC1|CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE.            
20101230011832.000|20101230011832.000|CC1|>> EXACTLY.                     
20101230011832.000|20101230011834.000|CC1|AND I DOUBT THERE'S GOING TO BE 
20101230011834.000|20101230011835.000|CC1|ANYONE THAT DOES NOT BELIEVE    
20101230011835.000|20101230011836.000|CC1|THAT HE LOADED THAT WEAPON.     
20101230011836.000|20101230011838.000|CC1|AND VERY LIKELY, THAT'S WHAT    
20101230011838.000|20101230011839.000|CC1|THEY'RE GOING TO DO.            
20101230011839.000|20101230011840.000|CC1|THEY'RE GOING TO EXAMINE THOSE  
20101230011840.000|20101230011841.000|CC1|BULLETS, SO THERE'S NO          
20101230011841.000|20101230011842.000|CC1|CONTRADICTION ON HIS BEHALF THAT
20101230011842.000|20101230011843.000|CC1|SHE LOADED THE WEAPON.          
20101230011843.000|20101230011847.000|CC1|SO THEY WILL LOOK FOR LATENT    
20101230011847.000|20101230011847.000|CC1|PRINTS ON THAT WEAPON OR THE    
20101230011847.000|20101230011849.000|CC1|BULLETS THAT WERE EJECTED FROM  
20101230011849.000|20101230011849.000|CC1|THAT GUN.

20101230011908.000|20101230011910.000|CC1|THAT WAS THE RULE MY DAD HAD.
