20101230141519.150|20101230141521.011|TR0|defense mechanisms either didn't 
20101230141521.011|20101230141522.873|TR0|work, were activated too late, 
20101230141522.873|20101230141524.735|TR0|or weren't deployed at all.

20101230141545.212|20101230141547.074|TR0|Welcome to Democracy Now!
20101230141547.074|20101230141548.935|TR0|
20101230141548.935|20101230141550.797|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: YThank you.
20101230141550.797|20101230141552.659|TR0|
20101230141552.659|20101230141554.520|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: This is an 
20101230141554.520|20101230141556.382|TR0|exhaustive investigation. You 
20101230141556.382|20101230141558.243|TR0|spent five months on it. And I 
20101230141558.243|20101230141600.105|TR0|think what's most powerful about 
20101230141600.105|20101230141601.967|TR0|it are the individual stories 
20101230141601.967|20101230141603.828|TR0|you tell of the workers onboard. 
20101230141603.828|20101230141605.690|TR0|But why don't you, in these last 
20101230141605.690|20101230141607.551|TR0|hours of 2010, lay out for us 
20101230141607.551|20101230141609.413|TR0|what happened? Tell that story, 
20101230141609.413|20101230141611.275|TR0|as they did, one of the biggest 
20101230141611.275|20101230141613.136|TR0|stories of 2010.
20101230141613.136|20101230141614.998|TR0|
20101230141614.998|20101230141616.859|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: Well, you have 
20101230141616.859|20101230141618.721|TR0|this oil rig, which we've all 
20101230141618.721|20101230141620.583|TR0|seen photographs of, this 
20101230141620.583|20101230141622.444|TR0|enormous structure 50 miles out 
20101230141622.444|20101230141624.306|TR0|in the Gulf of Mexico, and it 
20101230141624.306|20101230141626.167|TR0|went down after the oil spill. 
20101230141626.167|20101230141628.029|TR0|And I think many people sort of 
20101230141628.029|20101230141629.890|TR0|assume that it was like an 
20101230141629.890|20101230141631.752|TR0|inevitable kind of casualty of 
20101230141631.752|20101230141633.614|TR0|the blowout itself. But in fact, 
20101230141633.614|20101230141635.475|TR0|this oil rig was kind of like 
20101230141635.475|20101230141637.337|TR0|the Titanic. I mean, it was this 
20101230141637.337|20101230141639.198|TR0|incredible apparatus, this 
20101230141639.198|20101230141641.060|TR0|marvel of engineering, and it 
20101230141641.060|20101230141642.922|TR0|had all of these systems, these 
20101230141642.922|20101230141644.783|TR0|safety systems - state of the 
20101230141644.783|20101230141646.645|TR0|art, many of them - that were 
20101230141646.645|20101230141648.506|TR0|all designed to prevent the very 
20101230141648.506|20101230141650.368|TR0|thing that happened from 
20101230141650.368|20101230141652.230|TR0|happening.
20101230141652.230|20101230141654.091|TR0|
20101230141654.091|20101230141655.953|TR0|And not only that, what also was 
20101230141655.953|20101230141657.814|TR0|striking about this is that it 
20101230141657.814|20101230141659.676|TR0|had a crew that was trained, 
20101230141659.676|20101230141701.538|TR0|trained frequently, on how to 
20101230141701.538|20101230141703.399|TR0|respond to blowouts, how to 
20101230141703.399|20101230141705.261|TR0|respond to fires, how to get off 
20101230141705.261|20101230141707.122|TR0|the rig quickly. And it also had 
20101230141707.122|20101230141708.984|TR0|leaders on this rig who had 
20101230141708.984|20101230141710.846|TR0|decades of experience in 
20101230141710.846|20101230141712.707|TR0|drilling in deepwater 
20101230141712.707|20101230141714.569|TR0|environments, and they knew all 
20101230141714.569|20101230141716.430|TR0|about blowouts, kicks, well 
20101230141716.430|20101230141718.292|TR0|control problems. And yet, on 
20101230141718.292|20101230141720.154|TR0|this night, on April 20th, every 
20101230141720.154|20101230141722.015|TR0|one of those systems, every one 
20101230141722.015|20101230141723.877|TR0|of those rehearsals, drills, 
20101230141723.877|20101230141725.738|TR0|etc., it all failed, and failed 
20101230141725.738|20101230141727.600|TR0|miserably.
20101230141727.600|20101230141729.462|TR0|
20101230141729.462|20101230141731.323|TR0|And it didn't fail because 
20101230141731.323|20101230141733.185|TR0|people were - you know, wanted 
20101230141733.185|20101230141735.046|TR0|something bad to happen or were 
20101230141735.046|20101230141736.908|TR0|not trying to do the best that 
20101230141736.908|20101230141738.770|TR0|they could, but what we 
20101230141738.770|20101230141740.631|TR0|discovered was that there was a 
20101230141740.631|20101230141742.493|TR0|kind of paralysis that gripped 
20101230141742.493|20101230141744.354|TR0|this vast rig in critical places 
20101230141744.354|20101230141746.216|TR0|at critical times. And what it 
20101230141746.216|20101230141748.077|TR0|resulted in is it resulted in 
20101230141748.077|20101230141749.939|TR0|people not taking the steps, not 
20101230141749.939|20101230141751.801|TR0|deploying some of these safety 
20101230141751.801|20101230141753.662|TR0|systems, or trying to deploy 
20101230141753.662|20101230141755.524|TR0|them but deploying them too 
20101230141755.524|20101230141757.385|TR0|late, when the damage had 
20101230141757.385|20101230141759.247|TR0|already been done.
20101230141759.247|20101230141801.109|TR0|
20101230141801.109|20101230141802.970|TR0|And the net effect of this 
20101230141802.970|20101230141804.832|TR0|paralysis is that for nine 
20101230141804.832|20101230141806.693|TR0|minutes, from when the blowout 
20101230141806.693|20101230141808.555|TR0|first hit the rig until these 
20101230141808.555|20101230141810.417|TR0|crippling explosions that 
20101230141810.417|20101230141812.278|TR0|basically left this a dead ship, 
20101230141812.278|20101230141814.140|TR0|those nine minutes, there was no 
20101230141814.140|20101230141816.001|TR0|alarm, general alarm, issued to 
20101230141816.001|20101230141817.863|TR0|the 126 people who were on this 
20101230141817.863|20101230141819.725|TR0|rig. So, for most of the people 
20101230141819.725|20101230141821.586|TR0|on the rig, the first time they 
20101230141821.586|20101230141823.448|TR0|really understood that there was 
20101230141823.448|20101230141825.309|TR0|a major crisis going on was when 
20101230141825.309|20101230141827.171|TR0|the explosions ripped through 
20101230141827.171|20101230141829.033|TR0|this oil rig, in many cases 
20101230141829.033|20101230141830.894|TR0|injuring people, in some cases 
20101230141830.894|20101230141832.756|TR0|quite, quite devastating 
20101230141832.756|20101230141834.617|TR0|injuries - burns, broken bones, 
20101230141834.617|20101230141836.479|TR0|that kind of thing.
20101230141836.479|20101230141838.341|TR0|
20101230141838.341|20101230141840.202|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, David, 
20101230141840.202|20101230141842.064|TR0|it is a fascinating account. And 
20101230141842.064|20101230141843.925|TR0|as I told you before the show 
20101230141843.925|20101230141845.787|TR0|started, it's not every day that 
20101230141845.787|20101230141847.649|TR0|I read a full New York Times 
20101230141847.649|20101230141849.510|TR0|multi-page story. But this one 
20101230141849.510|20101230141851.372|TR0|really read like a novel, in 
20101230141851.372|20101230141853.233|TR0|terms of what actually happened. 
20101230141853.233|20101230141855.095|TR0|And especially, as you say, it 
20101230141855.095|20101230141856.957|TR0|wasn't just a failure of the 
20101230141856.957|20101230141858.818|TR0|equipment, but there were 
20101230141858.818|20101230141900.680|TR0|several moments when key 
20101230141900.680|20101230141902.541|TR0|decisions were made by these 
20101230141902.541|20101230141904.403|TR0|experienced people that, had 
20101230141904.403|20101230141906.264|TR0|they made a decision one way -
20101230141906.264|20101230141908.126|TR0|
20101230141908.126|20101230141909.988|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: Yes.
20101230141909.988|20101230141911.849|TR0|
20101230141911.849|20101230141913.711|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: - there would 
20101230141913.711|20101230141915.572|TR0|have been a far different 
20101230141915.572|20101230141917.434|TR0|result. And I'm wondering if you 
20101230141917.434|20101230141919.296|TR0|could go through some of those 
20101230141919.296|20101230141921.157|TR0|and the - beginning from what 
20101230141921.157|20101230141923.019|TR0|they were doing, actually, which 
20101230141923.019|20101230141924.880|TR0|was actually monitoring the well 
20101230141924.880|20101230141926.742|TR0|itself before capping it, and 
20101230141926.742|20101230141928.604|TR0|then going through some of the 
20101230141928.604|20101230141930.465|TR0|key mistakes that occurred.
20101230141930.465|20101230141932.327|TR0|
20101230141932.327|20101230141934.188|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: Yeah. One of 
20101230141934.188|20101230141936.050|TR0|the ways that I put it in the 
20101230141936.050|20101230141937.912|TR0|piece was that this rig was like 
20101230141937.912|20101230141939.773|TR0|a kind of a Gulf Coast town that 
20101230141939.773|20101230141941.635|TR0|was well prepared for Category 1 
20101230141941.635|20101230141943.496|TR0|hurricanes but never 
20101230141943.496|20101230141945.358|TR0|contemplated what they would do 
20101230141945.358|20101230141947.220|TR0|when they were hit with a 
20101230141947.220|20101230141949.081|TR0|hundred-year storm. And it was 
20101230141949.081|20101230141950.943|TR0|sort of - you could see this 
20101230141950.943|20101230141952.804|TR0|even in the training policies. 
20101230141952.804|20101230141954.666|TR0|They were given very big, thick 
20101230141954.666|20101230141956.528|TR0|guidelines from Transocean, the 
20101230141956.528|20101230141958.389|TR0|owner of this rig, on when they 
20101230141958.389|20101230142000.251|TR0|should deploy these various 
20101230142000.251|20101230142002.112|TR0|systems. But there was a kind of 
20101230142002.112|20101230142003.974|TR0|a contradiction in these 
20101230142003.974|20101230142005.836|TR0|policies. The policies would 
20101230142005.836|20101230142007.697|TR0|say, "You really need to act 
20101230142007.697|20101230142009.559|TR0|quickly. It's crucial. The 
20101230142009.559|20101230142011.420|TR0|history of oil rig disasters is 
20101230142011.420|20101230142013.282|TR0|the history of small problems 
20101230142013.282|20101230142015.143|TR0|that don't get addressed right 
20101230142015.143|20101230142017.005|TR0|away." And yet, they would also 
20101230142017.005|20101230142018.867|TR0|say, "But there's a really big 
20101230142018.867|20101230142020.728|TR0|danger if you overreact. And if 
20101230142020.728|20101230142022.590|TR0|you overreact, then it could 
20101230142022.590|20101230142024.451|TR0|cost us a lot of money, it could 
20101230142024.451|20101230142026.313|TR0|create other safety issues." And 
20101230142026.313|20101230142028.175|TR0|you see moments along the way 
20101230142028.175|20101230142030.036|TR0|where that contradiction 
20101230142030.036|20101230142031.898|TR0|essentially froze key people at 
20101230142031.898|20101230142033.759|TR0|key times.
20101230142033.759|20101230142035.621|TR0|
20101230142035.621|20101230142037.483|TR0|And the best example I can think 
20101230142037.483|20101230142039.344|TR0|of on this point is what 
20101230142039.344|20101230142041.206|TR0|happened on the bridge. You have 
20101230142041.206|20101230142043.067|TR0|the bridge of this rig. You have 
20101230142043.067|20101230142044.929|TR0|a captain. You have other 
20101230142044.929|20101230142046.791|TR0|officers. And several minutes 
20101230142046.791|20101230142048.652|TR0|into this crisis, all of a 
20101230142048.652|20101230142050.514|TR0|sudden the computer consoles 
20101230142050.514|20101230142052.375|TR0|started lighting up with gas 
20101230142052.375|20101230142054.237|TR0|alarms. And there are gas alarms 
20101230142054.237|20101230142056.099|TR0|that are - there are detectors 
20101230142056.099|20101230142057.960|TR0|all over this rig that are 
20101230142057.960|20101230142059.822|TR0|constantly sensing and detecting 
20101230142059.822|20101230142101.683|TR0|even the slightest trace of gas. 
20101230142101.683|20101230142103.545|TR0|And when they detect really high 
20101230142103.545|20101230142105.407|TR0|levels of gas, the alarms are 
20101230142105.407|20101230142107.268|TR0|colored magenta. And all of a 
20101230142107.268|20101230142109.130|TR0|sudden, on these computer 
20101230142109.130|20101230142110.991|TR0|consoles in the bridge, there 
20101230142110.991|20101230142112.853|TR0|were dozens of magenta lights 
20101230142112.853|20101230142114.715|TR0|lighting up. Well, the officers 
20101230142114.715|20101230142116.576|TR0|on this rig had trained on what 
20101230142116.576|20101230142118.438|TR0|you do when you see a magenta 
20101230142118.438|20101230142120.299|TR0|light or one alarm going off. 
20101230142120.299|20101230142122.161|TR0|And they had a whole sort of 
20101230142122.161|20101230142124.023|TR0|procedure set up. First you 
20101230142124.023|20101230142125.884|TR0|acknowledge the alarm. Then you 
20101230142125.884|20101230142127.746|TR0|silence the alarm. Then you call 
20101230142127.746|20101230142129.607|TR0|the captain. You call the other 
20101230142129.607|20101230142131.469|TR0|supervisors. You send somebody 
20101230142131.469|20101230142133.330|TR0|with a handheld detector to go 
20101230142133.330|20101230142135.192|TR0|check the area, confirm the 
20101230142135.192|20101230142137.054|TR0|alarm. Then you come back. And 
20101230142137.054|20101230142138.915|TR0|it contemplated a much smaller 
20101230142138.915|20101230142140.777|TR0|kind of crisis. But when they 
20101230142140.777|20101230142142.638|TR0|were confronted with dozens of 
20101230142142.638|20101230142144.500|TR0|alarms going off all at once, 
20101230142144.500|20101230142146.362|TR0|they didn't know what to do. 
20101230142146.362|20101230142148.223|TR0|They hadn't been trained for 
20101230142148.223|20101230142150.085|TR0|that moment. And they said, 
20101230142150.085|20101230142151.946|TR0|quite frankly, you know, "We 
20101230142151.946|20101230142153.808|TR0|just didn't know what to do."
20101230142153.808|20101230142155.670|TR0|
20101230142155.670|20101230142157.531|TR0|Likewise, they have another - 
20101230142157.531|20101230142159.393|TR0|right at the same console where 
20101230142159.393|20101230142201.254|TR0|they have these magenta lights 
20101230142201.254|20101230142203.116|TR0|going off, they have another 
20101230142203.116|20101230142204.978|TR0|system that allows them to shut 
20101230142204.978|20101230142206.839|TR0|down ventilation systems, shut 
20101230142206.839|20101230142208.701|TR0|down electrical systems to 
20101230142208.701|20101230142210.562|TR0|prevent a source of ignition. 
20101230142210.562|20101230142212.424|TR0|They even have a button that 
20101230142212.424|20101230142214.286|TR0|would shut down the main engines 
20101230142214.286|20101230142216.147|TR0|on the rig, which were the 
20101230142216.147|20101230142218.009|TR0|things that ultimately exploded 
20101230142218.009|20101230142219.870|TR0|so devastatingly on this rig. 
20101230142219.870|20101230142221.732|TR0|But this is a system that is 
20101230142221.732|20101230142223.594|TR0|incredibly complex. One of these 
20101230142223.594|20101230142225.455|TR0|systems takes 30 different 
20101230142225.455|20101230142227.317|TR0|buttons that you have to pick 
20101230142227.317|20101230142229.178|TR0|from in order to deploy it and 
20101230142229.178|20101230142231.040|TR0|deploy it under the crunch of 
20101230142231.040|20101230142232.902|TR0|time. If you can imagine, put 
20101230142232.902|20101230142234.763|TR0|yourself in the shoes of those 
20101230142234.763|20101230142236.625|TR0|people on that bridge. This 
20101230142236.625|20101230142238.486|TR0|system had initially been 
20101230142238.486|20101230142240.348|TR0|designed to be automatic. 
20101230142240.348|20101230142242.209|TR0|Transocean set some of these 
20101230142242.209|20101230142244.071|TR0|systems so that they basically 
20101230142244.071|20101230142245.933|TR0|required a human being to make 
20101230142245.933|20101230142247.794|TR0|the correct decision at the 
20101230142247.794|20101230142249.656|TR0|correct time, armed with the 
20101230142249.656|20101230142251.517|TR0|correct information. You kind of 
20101230142251.517|20101230142253.379|TR0|needed a triple-bang shot of all 
20101230142253.379|20101230142255.241|TR0|the right things to occur. And 
20101230142255.241|20101230142257.102|TR0|what happened again and again 
20101230142257.102|20101230142258.964|TR0|and again that night was that 
20101230142258.964|20101230142300.825|TR0|you didn't have the right people 
20101230142300.825|20101230142302.687|TR0|with the right information with 
20101230142302.687|20101230142304.549|TR0|the right systems. And what 
20101230142304.549|20101230142306.410|TR0|happened was this kind of 
20101230142306.410|20101230142308.272|TR0|paralysis.

20101230142328.749|20101230142330.611|TR0|argue that if you have alarm

20101230142512.999|20101230142514.860|TR0|felt it all over, all over me. I 
20101230142514.860|20101230142516.722|TR0|felt it, and I smelled it, 
20101230142516.722|20101230142518.583|TR0|tasted it. And I just knew that 
20101230142518.583|20101230142520.445|TR0|that was bad. And that's when I 
20101230142520.445|20101230142522.307|TR0|kind of - I kind of panicked a 
20101230142522.307|20101230142524.168|TR0|little bit. And I looked at 
20101230142524.168|20101230142526.030|TR0|Daniel, and I said, "Daniel, 
20101230142526.030|20101230142527.891|TR0|that's gas. We have to get out 
20101230142527.891|20101230142529.753|TR0|of here."

20101230142537.199|20101230142539.061|TR0|might have prevented gas from

20101230142550.231|20101230142552.092|TR0|lights went out. Then they heard 
20101230142552.092|20101230142553.954|TR0|the first explosion.

20101230142633.047|20101230142634.909|TR0|and saw the door to the crew's 
20101230142634.909|20101230142636.770|TR0|quarters had been blown open. A

20101230142822.881|20101230142824.743|TR0|you know, after that was done, I 
20101230142824.743|20101230142826.605|TR0|had to walk - walk off. And 
20101230142826.605|20101230142828.466|TR0|then, you know, a couple people 
20101230142828.466|20101230142830.328|TR0|came over there and, you know, 
20101230142830.328|20101230142832.189|TR0|were asking, "Are you alright?

20101230142858.252|20101230142900.113|TR0|to some of the mistakes that 
20101230142900.113|20101230142901.975|TR0|were made, like the failure to 
20101230142901.975|20101230142903.836|TR0|bring in the emergency 
20101230142903.836|20101230142905.698|TR0|disconnect system, also the 
20101230142905.698|20101230142907.560|TR0|failure to, when the oil started 
20101230142907.560|20101230142909.421|TR0|gushing up, to redirect it out 
20101230142909.421|20101230142911.283|TR0|to the ocean. And overall, the 
20101230142911.283|20101230142913.144|TR0|story does not paint a very good 
20101230142913.144|20101230142915.006|TR0|picture of the decisions of the 
20101230142915.006|20101230142916.868|TR0|captain of the rig. Could you 
20101230142916.868|20101230142918.729|TR0|talk about some of those 
20101230142918.729|20101230142920.591|TR0|decisions and what the crew did

20101230142924.314|20101230142926.176|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: I think the 
20101230142926.176|20101230142928.037|TR0|most controversial moment with 
20101230142928.037|20101230142929.899|TR0|the captain himself comes from 
20101230142929.899|20101230142931.760|TR0|an allegation that was made by 
20101230142931.760|20101230142933.622|TR0|the chief engineer on the rig, 
20101230142933.622|20101230142935.484|TR0|who said that during the 
20101230142935.484|20101230142937.345|TR0|evacuation process, that at one 
20101230142937.345|20101230142939.207|TR0|moment the captain suggested 
20101230142939.207|20101230142941.068|TR0|leaving behind a very badly 
20101230142941.068|20101230142942.930|TR0|wounded crew member. The captain 
20101230142942.930|20101230142944.792|TR0|has denied that through his 
20101230142944.792|20101230142946.653|TR0|lawyer. But what emerges in the 
20101230142946.653|20101230142948.515|TR0|interviews and in the testimony, 
20101230142948.515|20101230142950.376|TR0|especially about the captain, is 
20101230142950.376|20101230142952.238|TR0|a sense of a young man - he's 34 
20101230142952.238|20101230142954.100|TR0|years old, I believe, had been a 
20101230142954.100|20101230142955.961|TR0|captain for a couple of years - 
20101230142955.961|20101230142957.823|TR0|who seemed like what he was 
20101230142957.823|20101230142959.684|TR0|really trying to do was sort of 
20101230142959.684|20101230143001.546|TR0|say, "OK, everything is OK. 
20101230143001.546|20101230143003.408|TR0|Everything is - be calm. This 
20101230143003.408|20101230143005.269|TR0|isn't as bad as it might look," 
20101230143005.269|20101230143007.131|TR0|and was kind of consistently 
20101230143007.131|20101230143008.992|TR0|counseling against taking the 
20101230143008.992|20101230143010.854|TR0|kind of really decisive steps 
20101230143010.854|20101230143012.715|TR0|that, in retrospect, looking 
20101230143012.715|20101230143014.577|TR0|back, probably did need to be 
20101230143014.577|20101230143016.439|TR0|taken. So, for example, one of 
20101230143016.439|20101230143018.300|TR0|the really important safety 
20101230143018.300|20101230143020.162|TR0|systems is this ability to 
20101230143020.162|20101230143022.023|TR0|disconnect the rig from the well 
20101230143022.023|20101230143023.885|TR0|- in other words, cut it off 
20101230143023.885|20101230143025.747|TR0|from the source of the fire that 
20101230143025.747|20101230143027.608|TR0|is consuming this rig. And 
20101230143027.608|20101230143029.470|TR0|that's triggered with something 
20101230143029.470|20101230143031.331|TR0|called the emergency disconnect 
20101230143031.331|20101230143033.193|TR0|system. And after the 
20101230143033.193|20101230143035.055|TR0|explosions, you had some of the 
20101230143035.055|20101230143036.916|TR0|crew members saying, "We need to 
20101230143036.916|20101230143038.778|TR0|hit this emergency disconnect." 
20101230143038.778|20101230143040.639|TR0|It's like hitting the eject 
20101230143040.639|20101230143042.501|TR0|button if you're a fighter pilot.
20101230143042.501|20101230143044.363|TR0|
20101230143044.363|20101230143046.224|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Just get away 
20101230143046.224|20101230143048.086|TR0|from it, get away - take the rig 
20101230143048.086|20101230143049.947|TR0|away from the fire.
20101230143049.947|20101230143051.809|TR0|
20101230143051.809|20101230143053.671|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: Get away. And 
20101230143053.671|20101230143055.532|TR0|there was a reluctance on the 
20101230143055.532|20101230143057.394|TR0|part of the captain to take that 
20101230143057.394|20101230143059.255|TR0|step, even though, at that 
20101230143059.255|20101230143101.117|TR0|point, they had no power, they 
20101230143101.117|20101230143102.979|TR0|were burning, explosions going 
20101230143102.979|20101230143104.840|TR0|off all over the place. And so, 
20101230143104.840|20101230143106.702|TR0|that was, I think, a moment 
20101230143106.702|20101230143108.563|TR0|where you see this kind of "push 
20101230143108.563|20101230143110.425|TR0|me, pull you" of the Transocean 
20101230143110.425|20101230143112.287|TR0|safety policies coming into a 
20101230143112.287|20101230143114.148|TR0|moment where it leads someone 
20101230143114.148|20101230143116.010|TR0|like that into a kind of - some 
20101230143116.010|20101230143117.871|TR0|indecision.
20101230143117.871|20101230143119.733|TR0|
20101230143119.733|20101230143121.595|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: And yet, this 
20101230143121.595|20101230143123.456|TR0|was, as you mentioned, the 
20101230143123.456|20101230143125.318|TR0|Titanic of oil rigs, so 
20101230143125.318|20101230143127.179|TR0|supposedly this was the state of 
20101230143127.179|20101230143129.041|TR0|the art. What does this say 
20101230143129.041|20101230143130.902|TR0|about other rigs out there in 
20101230143130.902|20101230143132.764|TR0|the Gulf and about the future of 
20101230143132.764|20101230143134.626|TR0|deepwater drilling, in general, 
20101230143134.626|20101230143136.487|TR0|and what the government should 
20101230143136.487|20101230143138.349|TR0|be wary about long term?
20101230143138.349|20101230143140.210|TR0|
20101230143140.210|20101230143142.072|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: Yeah, this is 
20101230143142.072|20101230143143.934|TR0|really one of the remarkable 
20101230143143.934|20101230143145.795|TR0|aspects of this story. These are 
20101230143145.795|20101230143147.657|TR0|not like fly-by-night operators. 
20101230143147.657|20101230143149.518|TR0|These are not second-, 
20101230143149.518|20101230143151.380|TR0|third-tier operators. These are 
20101230143151.380|20101230143153.242|TR0|the A team. This is the - you 
20101230143153.242|20101230143155.103|TR0|know, the first string of 
20101230143155.103|20101230143156.965|TR0|deepwater drilling in the Gulf 
20101230143156.965|20101230143158.826|TR0|of Mexico. And the fact that 
20101230143158.826|20101230143200.688|TR0|this rig, with this crew, could 
20101230143200.688|20101230143202.550|TR0|go down in this fashion, I 
20101230143202.550|20101230143204.411|TR0|think, raises some really 
20101230143204.411|20101230143206.273|TR0|important questions about the 
20101230143206.273|20101230143208.134|TR0|other rigs that are going to be 
20101230143208.134|20101230143209.996|TR0|continuing to drill in very 
20101230143209.996|20101230143211.858|TR0|tough circumstances out in the 
20101230143211.858|20101230143213.719|TR0|Gulf of Mexico.
20101230143213.719|20101230143215.581|TR0|
20101230143215.581|20101230143217.442|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Because Obama 
20101230143217.442|20101230143219.304|TR0|has lifted the moratorium on 
20101230143219.304|20101230143221.166|TR0|offshore drilling.
20101230143221.166|20101230143223.027|TR0|
20101230143223.027|20101230143224.889|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: He has. He has 
20101230143224.889|20101230143226.750|TR0|lifted the moratorium. And one 
20101230143226.750|20101230143228.612|TR0|of the critical safety devices 
20101230143228.612|20101230143230.474|TR0|in this whole mess is this thing 
20101230143230.474|20101230143232.335|TR0|called a blowout preventer. And 
20101230143232.335|20101230143234.197|TR0|this is the thing that rests on 
20101230143234.197|20101230143236.058|TR0|the seabed, and it is this 
20101230143236.058|20101230143237.920|TR0|five-story-tall, hundreds - you 
20101230143237.920|20101230143239.781|TR0|know, just a massive device that 
20101230143239.781|20101230143241.643|TR0|is supposed to be triggered from 
20101230143241.643|20101230143243.505|TR0|the rig itself to seal the well 
20101230143243.505|20101230143245.366|TR0|- is supposed to be triggered 
20101230143245.366|20101230143247.228|TR0|from the rig itself to seal the 
20101230143247.228|20101230143249.089|TR0|well in an emergency, in this 
20101230143249.089|20101230143250.951|TR0|case. Transocean has made a 
20101230143250.951|20101230143252.813|TR0|really remarkable argument 
20101230143252.813|20101230143254.674|TR0|lately. They have argued that 
20101230143254.674|20101230143256.536|TR0|this blowout preventer simply 
20101230143256.536|20101230143258.397|TR0|wasn't capable of preventing 
20101230143258.397|20101230143300.259|TR0|this blowout. Well, that's a 
20101230143300.259|20101230143302.121|TR0|remarkable thing, because the 
20101230143302.121|20101230143303.982|TR0|blowout preventer is the key 
20101230143303.982|20101230143305.844|TR0|safety device for all of these 
20101230143305.844|20101230143307.705|TR0|rigs out there in the Gulf of 
20101230143307.705|20101230143309.567|TR0|Mexico. And if they're sitting 
20101230143309.567|20101230143311.429|TR0|on top of blowout preventers 
20101230143311.429|20101230143313.290|TR0|that are not, as the industry 
20101230143313.290|20101230143315.152|TR0|has long portrayed, the kind of 
20101230143315.152|20101230143317.013|TR0|ultimate fail-safe device, then 
20101230143317.013|20101230143318.875|TR0|this is something that I think 
20101230143318.875|20101230143320.737|TR0|would be a major issue for 
20101230143320.737|20101230143322.598|TR0|regulators at the Interior 
20101230143322.598|20101230143324.460|TR0|Department who are trying to 
20101230143324.460|20101230143326.321|TR0|think about how do we go forward 
20101230143326.321|20101230143328.183|TR0|with deepwater drilling in a way 
20101230143328.183|20101230143330.045|TR0|that doesn't result in another 
20101230143330.045|20101230143331.906|TR0|one of these, you know, next 
20101230143331.906|20101230143333.768|TR0|year or the year after.

20101230143343.076|20101230143344.937|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: Well, not when 
20101230143344.937|20101230143346.799|TR0|you spend any time down on the 
20101230143346.799|20101230143348.661|TR0|Gulf Coast, when you spend time 
20101230143348.661|20101230143350.522|TR0|down there and you understand 
20101230143350.522|20101230143352.384|TR0|the centrality of the 
20101230143352.384|20101230143354.245|TR0|oil-drilling industry to the 
20101230143354.245|20101230143356.107|TR0|entire economy along that part 
20101230143356.107|20101230143357.968|TR0|of the coastline, and you begin 
20101230143357.968|20101230143359.830|TR0|hearing and feeling the 
20101230143359.830|20101230143401.692|TR0|political pressure that builds. 
20101230143401.692|20101230143403.553|TR0|And it's not like a Republican 
20101230143403.553|20101230143405.415|TR0|or - I mean, they're all in 
20101230143405.415|20101230143407.276|TR0|agreement that we've got to get 
20101230143407.276|20101230143409.138|TR0|going again. When you see the

20101230143416.584|20101230143418.446|TR0|this really, in a way, is one of

20101230143501.263|20101230143503.124|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: David, I'd 
20101230143503.124|20101230143504.986|TR0|like to ask you also about that. 
20101230143504.986|20101230143506.847|TR0|There's been some criticism of 
20101230143506.847|20101230143508.709|TR0|your series by other colleagues, 
20101230143508.709|20101230143510.571|TR0|Associated Press, in particular, 
20101230143510.571|20101230143512.432|TR0|which has distinguished itself 
20101230143512.432|20101230143514.294|TR0|by covering this story for 
20101230143514.294|20101230143516.155|TR0|throughout the year, claiming 
20101230143516.155|20101230143518.017|TR0|that much of the conclusions 
20101230143518.017|20101230143519.879|TR0|that you reached, of the 
20101230143519.879|20101230143521.740|TR0|reporting, had previously been 
20101230143521.740|20101230143523.602|TR0|done by them and other news 
20101230143523.602|20101230143525.463|TR0|organizations, and there was 
20101230143525.463|20101230143527.325|TR0|really nothing that new in this 
20101230143527.325|20101230143529.187|TR0|story. I'm interested in your 
20101230143529.187|20101230143531.048|TR0|response to that.
20101230143531.048|20101230143532.910|TR0|
20101230143532.910|20101230143534.771|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: The first I 
20101230143534.771|20101230143536.633|TR0|heard of it was when I heard 
20101230143536.633|20101230143538.495|TR0|that the managing editor of the 
20101230143538.495|20101230143540.356|TR0|Associated Press had called to 
20101230143540.356|20101230143542.218|TR0|apologize to our editors for 
20101230143542.218|20101230143544.079|TR0|that letter that was written by 
20101230143544.079|20101230143545.941|TR0|a reporter who was covering the 
20101230143545.941|20101230143547.803|TR0|oil spill for them. The fact of 
20101230143547.803|20101230143549.664|TR0|the matter is that, as we said 
20101230143549.664|20101230143551.526|TR0|in the story, this was based on 
20101230143551.526|20101230143553.387|TR0|interviews with 21 crew members 
20101230143553.387|20101230143555.249|TR0|and also a very careful piecing 
20101230143555.249|20101230143557.111|TR0|together of testimony from 94 
20101230143557.111|20101230143558.972|TR0|others. So I can understand why, 
20101230143558.972|20101230143600.834|TR0|you know, an Associated Press 
20101230143600.834|20101230143602.695|TR0|reporter who's sitting there day 
20101230143602.695|20101230143604.557|TR0|in and day out writing short 
20101230143604.557|20101230143606.419|TR0|items about this or that snippet 
20101230143606.419|20101230143608.280|TR0|of testimony feels upset when we 
20101230143608.280|20101230143610.142|TR0|come along with an 8,500-word 
20101230143610.142|20101230143612.003|TR0|story that includes some of the 
20101230143612.003|20101230143613.865|TR0|stuff that he no doubt wrote 
20101230143613.865|20101230143615.727|TR0|about here and there.
20101230143615.727|20101230143617.588|TR0|
20101230143617.588|20101230143619.450|TR0|But I think what - if you go 
20101230143619.450|20101230143621.311|TR0|back and you look at the 
20101230143621.311|20101230143623.173|TR0|coverage, a lot of the coverage 
20101230143623.173|20101230143625.034|TR0|focused early on really on what 
20101230143625.034|20101230143626.896|TR0|caused the blowout, and so 
20101230143626.896|20101230143628.758|TR0|that's why we heard so much 
20101230143628.758|20101230143630.619|TR0|about well design and about 
20101230143630.619|20101230143632.481|TR0|cementing practices. And in the 
20101230143632.481|20101230143634.342|TR0|kind of look that we did at what 
20101230143634.342|20101230143636.204|TR0|actually caused this massive 
20101230143636.204|20101230143638.066|TR0|piece of equipment to go down at 
20101230143638.066|20101230143639.927|TR0|the cost of 11 lives, that's 
20101230143639.927|20101230143641.789|TR0|something that, you know, we all 
20101230143641.789|20101230143643.650|TR0|- you know, we look at the 
20101230143643.650|20101230143645.512|TR0|clips, we look at what's been 
20101230143645.512|20101230143647.374|TR0|done, and we saw that that was 
20101230143647.374|20101230143649.235|TR0|an area that really hadn't 
20101230143649.235|20101230143651.097|TR0|gotten the kind of attention 
20101230143651.097|20101230143652.958|TR0|that we thought an event of this 
20101230143652.958|20101230143654.820|TR0|magnitude really deserved. And 
20101230143654.820|20101230143656.682|TR0|that's what we - that's what we 
20101230143656.682|20101230143658.543|TR0|thought.
20101230143658.543|20101230143700.405|TR0|
20101230143700.405|20101230143702.266|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And finally, 
20101230143702.266|20101230143704.128|TR0|what most surprised you in your 
20101230143704.128|20101230143705.990|TR0|five-month investigation?
20101230143705.990|20101230143707.851|TR0|
20101230143707.851|20101230143709.713|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: What most - 
20101230143709.713|20101230143711.574|TR0|what most surprised me is - I 
20101230143711.574|20101230143713.436|TR0|know that we heard a lot early 
20101230143713.436|20101230143715.298|TR0|on about BP's safety culture. 
20101230143715.298|20101230143717.159|TR0|And it's true, they have a very 
20101230143717.159|20101230143719.021|TR0|troubling safety culture, and 
20101230143719.021|20101230143720.882|TR0|it's been well documented in a 
20101230143720.882|20101230143722.744|TR0|number of different areas, such 
20101230143722.744|20101230143724.606|TR0|as Texas City and in Alaska and 
20101230143724.606|20101230143726.467|TR0|in California. But the truth of 
20101230143726.467|20101230143728.329|TR0|the matter is that this is 
20101230143728.329|20101230143730.190|TR0|actually a little more 
20101230143730.190|20101230143732.052|TR0|complicated, because the safety 
20101230143732.052|20101230143733.914|TR0|culture on Deepwater Horizon 
20101230143733.914|20101230143735.775|TR0|really wasn't the BP safety 
20101230143735.775|20101230143737.637|TR0|culture. It was actually the 
20101230143737.637|20101230143739.498|TR0|Transocean safety culture. And 
20101230143739.498|20101230143741.360|TR0|that's a very different thing 
20101230143741.360|20101230143743.221|TR0|from the BP safety culture. And 
20101230143743.221|20101230143745.083|TR0|I think it would be in some ways 
20101230143745.083|20101230143746.945|TR0|comforting if we could all 
20101230143746.945|20101230143748.806|TR0|think, well, this is really just 
20101230143748.806|20101230143750.668|TR0|a story about a company that cut 
20101230143750.668|20101230143752.529|TR0|corners on safety, and this is 
20101230143752.529|20101230143754.391|TR0|the end result. What makes it 
20101230143754.391|20101230143756.253|TR0|more complicated and troubling 
20101230143756.253|20101230143758.114|TR0|in some ways is that that wasn't 
20101230143758.114|20101230143759.976|TR0|the case here. Transocean is a 
20101230143759.976|20101230143801.837|TR0|company with a very strong and 
20101230143801.837|20101230143803.699|TR0|potent safety culture. And that 
20101230143803.699|20101230143805.561|TR0|this could happen on this rig in 
20101230143805.561|20101230143807.422|TR0|that culture with these people 
20101230143807.422|20101230143809.284|TR0|should give us a lot more reason 
20101230143809.284|20101230143811.145|TR0|to think more deeply about what 
20101230143811.145|20101230143813.007|TR0|it means to do deepwater 
20101230143813.007|20101230143814.869|TR0|drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.

20101230143852.100|20101230143853.962|TR0|was released from a British jail 
20101230143853.962|20101230143855.824|TR0|this month, he downplayed the

20101230143857.685|20101230143859.547|TR0|Sweden, where he's wanted for

20101230143951.672|20101230143953.533|TR0|President Joe Biden confirmed

20101230143959.118|20101230144000.980|TR0|In an interview on Meet the 
20101230144000.980|20101230144002.841|TR0|Press, Biden said he thinks 
20101230144002.841|20101230144004.703|TR0|Assange could be a, quote, 
20101230144004.703|20101230144006.564|TR0|"high-tech terrorist."

20101230144008.426|20101230144010.287|TR0|>> VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I 
20101230144010.287|20101230144012.149|TR0|would argue that it's closer to 
20101230144012.149|20101230144014.011|TR0|being a high-tech terrorist than 
20101230144014.011|20101230144015.872|TR0|the Pentagon Papers. But look, 
20101230144015.872|20101230144017.734|TR0|this guy has done things that 
20101230144017.734|20101230144019.595|TR0|have damaged and put in jeopardy 
20101230144019.595|20101230144021.457|TR0|the lives and occupations of

20101230144023.319|20101230144025.180|TR0|world. He has made it more 
20101230144025.180|20101230144027.042|TR0|difficult for us to conduct our

20101230144047.519|20101230144049.381|TR0|Well, the potential use of the 
20101230144049.381|20101230144051.243|TR0|Espionage Act has special 
20101230144051.243|20101230144053.104|TR0|significance for our next guest. 
20101230144053.104|20101230144054.966|TR0|In a moment we'll speak with 
20101230144054.966|20101230144056.827|TR0|Robert Meeropol. He's the 
20101230144056.827|20101230144058.689|TR0|younger son of Julius and Ethel 
20101230144058.689|20101230144100.551|TR0|Rosenberg. They're the only U.S.

20101230144102.412|20101230144104.274|TR0|conspiracy to commit espionage, 
20101230144104.274|20101230144106.135|TR0|described as the most 
20101230144106.135|20101230144107.997|TR0|controversial death sentence in

20101230144111.720|20101230144113.582|TR0|The government alleged the

20101230144115.443|20101230144117.305|TR0|Sobell, helped the Soviet Union 
20101230144117.305|20101230144119.166|TR0|acquire the secret of the atomic 
20101230144119.166|20101230144121.028|TR0|bomb. But supporters say there's 
20101230144121.028|20101230144122.890|TR0|no evidence Ethel Rosenberg took 
20101230144122.890|20101230144124.751|TR0|part in espionage. And the 
20101230144124.751|20101230144126.613|TR0|Rosenbergs' family has admitted 
20101230144126.613|20101230144128.474|TR0|that while Julius Rosenberg did 
20101230144128.474|20101230144130.336|TR0|pass on information to the 
20101230144130.336|20101230144132.198|TR0|Soviet Union, none of it aided

20101230144145.229|20101230144147.090|TR0|had passed America's atomic bomb 
20101230144147.090|20101230144148.952|TR0|secrets to Russia. This was an 
20101230144148.952|20101230144150.814|TR0|undisputed fact that the whole 
20101230144150.814|20101230144152.675|TR0|world knew. The federal 
20101230144152.675|20101230144154.537|TR0|government had laid the crime at 
20101230144154.537|20101230144156.398|TR0|the doorstep of two native New 
20101230144156.398|20101230144158.260|TR0|Yorkers, Julius and Ethel 
20101230144158.260|20101230144200.122|TR0|Rosenberg. But to the end, they 
20101230144200.122|20101230144201.983|TR0|both protested their innocence 
20101230144201.983|20101230144203.845|TR0|of the theft. In April of 1951, 
20101230144203.845|20101230144205.706|TR0|the federal court of Judge 
20101230144205.706|20101230144207.568|TR0|Irving R. Kaufman found the pair

20101230144309.001|20101230144310.862|TR0|
20101230144310.862|20101230144312.724|TR0|Well, there's several layers 
20101230144312.724|20101230144314.585|TR0|that we should get into here. 
20101230144314.585|20101230144316.447|TR0|Perhaps the start is to 
20101230144316.447|20101230144318.309|TR0|understand what he may be 
20101230144318.309|20101230144320.170|TR0|indicted for - that is, 
20101230144320.170|20101230144322.032|TR0|conspiracy to violate the 
20101230144322.032|20101230144323.893|TR0|Espionage Act of 1917. A lot of 
20101230144323.893|20101230144325.755|TR0|people in the United States have 
20101230144325.755|20101230144327.617|TR0|been saying, since post-9/11 
20101230144327.617|20101230144329.478|TR0|America - in post-9/11 America, 
20101230144329.478|20101230144331.340|TR0|that we feel we have echoes of 
20101230144331.340|20101230144333.201|TR0|the McCarthy period. But in the 
20101230144333.201|20101230144335.063|TR0|McCarthy period itself, we 
20101230144335.063|20101230144336.925|TR0|really had the echoes of the 
20101230144336.925|20101230144338.786|TR0|aftermath of our entry into 
20101230144338.786|20101230144340.648|TR0|World War I, that period between 
20101230144340.648|20101230144342.509|TR0|1917 and the early 1920s. And 
20101230144342.509|20101230144344.371|TR0|World War I was very unpopular 
20101230144344.371|20101230144346.233|TR0|in the United States, and there 
20101230144346.233|20101230144348.094|TR0|was an effort to convince the 
20101230144348.094|20101230144349.956|TR0|public about this war, and that 
20101230144349.956|20101230144351.817|TR0|was a two-pronged effort. One 
20101230144351.817|20101230144353.679|TR0|was propaganda was put in place 
20101230144353.679|20101230144355.540|TR0|to drum up support for the war, 
20101230144355.540|20101230144357.402|TR0|but the other was the Espionage 
20101230144357.402|20101230144359.264|TR0|Act of 1917 was passed, 
20101230144359.264|20101230144401.125|TR0|basically to criminalize 
20101230144401.125|20101230144402.987|TR0|dissent. And this 
20101230144402.987|20101230144404.848|TR0|criminalization of criticism of 
20101230144404.848|20101230144406.710|TR0|government policy landed 
20101230144406.710|20101230144408.572|TR0|hundreds of people in jail, 
20101230144408.572|20101230144410.433|TR0|perhaps most famously Eugene 
20101230144410.433|20101230144412.295|TR0|Debs, the Socialist Party 
20101230144412.295|20101230144414.156|TR0|candidate for president who ran 
20101230144414.156|20101230144416.018|TR0|from a jail cell and got almost 
20101230144416.018|20101230144417.880|TR0|a million votes in 1920. That 
20101230144417.880|20101230144419.741|TR0|whole panoply of repressive 
20101230144419.741|20101230144421.603|TR0|activity, that quieted down 
20101230144421.603|20101230144423.464|TR0|after a while. But in the 
20101230144423.464|20101230144425.326|TR0|McCarthy period, it was 
20101230144425.326|20101230144427.188|TR0|reinstituted.
20101230144427.188|20101230144429.049|TR0|
20101230144429.049|20101230144430.911|TR0|And the act, the Espionage Act, 
20101230144430.911|20101230144432.772|TR0|has been criticized as an 
20101230144432.772|20101230144434.634|TR0|attempt to do an end run around 
20101230144434.634|20101230144436.496|TR0|the constitutional definition of 
20101230144436.496|20101230144438.357|TR0|"treason." You see, the founders 
20101230144438.357|20101230144440.219|TR0|of our nation were very anxious 
20101230144440.219|20101230144442.080|TR0|to make sure that the term 
20101230144442.080|20101230144443.942|TR0|"treason" wasn't thrown around 
20101230144443.942|20101230144445.804|TR0|to attack people who were 
20101230144445.804|20101230144447.665|TR0|dissenters. So they put, within 
20101230144447.665|20101230144449.527|TR0|the Constitution, a very narrow 
20101230144449.527|20101230144451.388|TR0|definition - giving aid and 
20101230144451.388|20101230144453.250|TR0|comfort to the enemy - in as the 
20101230144453.250|20101230144455.112|TR0|only way you could be convicted 
20101230144455.112|20101230144456.973|TR0|of treason. But as you saw in 
20101230144456.973|20101230144458.835|TR0|that television clip of the 
20101230144458.835|20101230144500.696|TR0|1950s, my parents charged under 
20101230144500.696|20101230144502.558|TR0|the Espionage Act of 1917, 
20101230144502.558|20101230144504.419|TR0|here's the press reporting 
20101230144504.419|20101230144506.281|TR0|"executed for their crime of 
20101230144506.281|20101230144508.143|TR0|treason." So this was an effort 
20101230144508.143|20101230144510.004|TR0|to do an end run around the 
20101230144510.004|20101230144511.866|TR0|treason clause of the 
20101230144511.866|20101230144513.727|TR0|Constitution and turn dissent 
20101230144513.727|20101230144515.589|TR0|into treason.
20101230144515.589|20101230144517.451|TR0|
20101230144517.451|20101230144519.312|TR0|Well, now we fast-forward to 
20101230144519.312|20101230144521.174|TR0|today, and we have the 
20101230144521.174|20101230144523.035|TR0|possibility that Julian Assange 
20101230144523.035|20101230144524.897|TR0|will be charged under that act. 
20101230144524.897|20101230144526.759|TR0|That act, by the way, is - it's 
20101230144526.759|20101230144528.620|TR0|pages and pages and pages of 
20101230144528.620|20101230144530.482|TR0|things that you can't do, and if 
20101230144530.482|20101230144532.343|TR0|you do it, if you disseminate, 
20101230144532.343|20101230144534.205|TR0|publicize, information that the 
20101230144534.205|20101230144536.067|TR0|government today declares 
20101230144536.067|20101230144537.928|TR0|secret, then you could be 
20101230144537.928|20101230144539.790|TR0|subject to massive prison 
20101230144539.790|20101230144541.651|TR0|sentences. And again, we have to 
20101230144541.651|20101230144543.513|TR0|place this in a broad context. A 
20101230144543.513|20101230144545.375|TR0|functioning democracy needs a 
20101230144545.375|20101230144547.236|TR0|free flow of information. But 
20101230144547.236|20101230144549.098|TR0|what we have in post-9/11 
20101230144549.098|20101230144550.959|TR0|America is a vast expansion of 
20101230144550.959|20101230144552.821|TR0|the secrecy complex. So, vast 
20101230144552.821|20101230144554.683|TR0|amounts of material can be 
20101230144554.683|20101230144556.544|TR0|declared secret. And then, if 
20101230144556.544|20101230144558.406|TR0|you reveal those secrets, you 
20101230144558.406|20101230144600.267|TR0|could be sent to jail. And, of 
20101230144600.267|20101230144602.129|TR0|course, this - well, this 
20101230144602.129|20101230144603.991|TR0|undermines the basis for 
20101230144603.991|20101230144605.852|TR0|democracy. And that's what's 
20101230144605.852|20101230144607.714|TR0|going on here. And that doesn't 
20101230144607.714|20101230144609.575|TR0|even get into the question of 
20101230144609.575|20101230144611.437|TR0|conspiracy.

20101230144643.084|20101230144644.946|TR0|us now from Massachusetts, who 
20101230144644.946|20101230144646.807|TR0|put out a piece in call of 
20101230144646.807|20101230144648.669|TR0|support for Julian Assange, 
20101230144648.669|20101230144650.530|TR0|because his parents, Julius and 
20101230144650.530|20101230144652.392|TR0|Ethel Rosenberg, the most famous 
20101230144652.392|20101230144654.254|TR0|case, the only people to be 
20101230144654.254|20101230144656.115|TR0|executed under the Espionage 
20101230144656.115|20101230144657.977|TR0|Act, that possibly the U.S. 
20101230144657.977|20101230144659.838|TR0|government is looking to charge 
20101230144659.838|20101230144701.700|TR0|Julian Assange with. Juan?
20101230144701.700|20101230144703.562|TR0|
20101230144703.562|20101230144705.423|TR0|>> JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, Robert, 
20101230144705.423|20101230144707.285|TR0|I'd like to ask you - this whole 
20101230144707.285|20101230144709.146|TR0|issue, as you were saying, about 
20101230144709.146|20101230144711.008|TR0|the government possibly trying 
20101230144711.008|20101230144712.870|TR0|to look at being able to charge 
20101230144712.870|20101230144714.731|TR0|Julian Assange under the 
20101230144714.731|20101230144716.593|TR0|Espionage Act, even if you get 
20101230144716.593|20101230144718.454|TR0|past - or those who believe that 
20101230144718.454|20101230144720.316|TR0|the Espionage Act is 
20101230144720.316|20101230144722.178|TR0|constitutional - the mere idea 
20101230144722.178|20101230144724.039|TR0|of charging someone who is not a 
20101230144724.039|20101230144725.901|TR0|U.S. citizen, who wasn't even in 
20101230144725.901|20101230144727.762|TR0|the country, with a violation of 
20101230144727.762|20101230144729.624|TR0|the U.S. Espionage Act really 
20101230144729.624|20101230144731.485|TR0|begins to take the American 
20101230144731.485|20101230144733.347|TR0|legal system to whole new realms 
20101230144733.347|20101230144735.209|TR0|of arrogance, I would - it seems 
20101230144735.209|20101230144737.070|TR0|to me, in terms of its power 
20101230144737.070|20101230144738.932|TR0|around the world.
20101230144738.932|20101230144740.793|TR0|
20101230144740.793|20101230144742.655|TR0|>> ROBERT MEEROPOL: Well, yes, 
20101230144742.655|20101230144744.517|TR0|that's true, but we shouldn't 
20101230144744.517|20101230144746.378|TR0|forget the case of Manuel 
20101230144746.378|20101230144748.240|TR0|Noriega. The United States - 
20101230144748.240|20101230144750.101|TR0|and, of course, we have 
20101230144750.101|20101230144751.963|TR0|Guantanamo and black site 
20101230144751.963|20101230144753.825|TR0|prisons all over the world. Our 
20101230144753.825|20101230144755.686|TR0|government rejects the universal 
20101230144755.686|20101230144757.548|TR0|jurisdiction of other nations or 
20101230144757.548|20101230144759.409|TR0|of the World Court. But as far 
20101230144759.409|20101230144801.271|TR0|as we're concerned, we are free 
20101230144801.271|20101230144803.133|TR0|to indict, and if we can get our 
20101230144803.133|20101230144804.994|TR0|hands on anyone anywhere all 
20101230144804.994|20101230144806.856|TR0|over the world. And that is, I 
20101230144806.856|20101230144808.717|TR0|would say, a prerogative of 
20101230144808.717|20101230144810.579|TR0|empire. It's a reality we face. 
20101230144810.579|20101230144812.441|TR0|It's not one that I approve of, 
20101230144812.441|20101230144814.302|TR0|but I think it's the reality of 
20101230144814.302|20101230144816.164|TR0|today.
20101230144816.164|20101230144818.025|TR0|

20101230144819.887|20101230144821.749|TR0|some more news footage from June 
20101230144821.749|20101230144823.610|TR0|1953. These reports are right 
20101230144823.610|20101230144825.472|TR0|before the Rosenbergs were 
20101230144825.472|20101230144827.333|TR0|executed, after their final 
20101230144827.333|20101230144829.195|TR0|appeals were rejected. One 
20101230144829.195|20101230144831.057|TR0|newscaster here lampoons the 
20101230144831.057|20101230144832.918|TR0|protesters who demonstrated in 
20101230144832.918|20101230144834.780|TR0|support of the Rosenbergs.

20101230144836.641|20101230144838.503|TR0|>> NEWSCASTER: Inside the stone 
20101230144838.503|20101230144840.365|TR0|walls of Sing Sing Prison, the 
20101230144840.365|20101230144842.226|TR0|Rosenbergs wait all day for word 
20101230144842.226|20101230144844.088|TR0|of their fate. It's now more 
20101230144844.088|20101230144845.949|TR0|than two years since they were 
20101230144845.949|20101230144847.811|TR0|first sentenced to die for 
20101230144847.811|20101230144849.672|TR0|organizing atomic espionage for 
20101230144849.672|20101230144851.534|TR0|Russia. Rabbi Irving Koslowe, a 
20101230144851.534|20101230144853.396|TR0|prison chaplain, goes in. He 
20101230144853.396|20101230144855.257|TR0|will not leave until after the 
20101230144855.257|20101230144857.119|TR0|execution, which is being held 
20101230144857.119|20101230144858.980|TR0|before sundown, because the 
20101230144858.980|20101230144900.842|TR0|setting of the sun this Friday 
20101230144900.842|20101230144902.704|TR0|marks the beginning of the Holy 
20101230144902.704|20101230144904.565|TR0|Sabbath in the Jewish calendar. 
20101230144904.565|20101230144906.427|TR0|A matron, Mamie Crayton, comes 
20101230144906.427|20101230144908.288|TR0|out after seeing Ethel 
20101230144908.288|20101230144910.150|TR0|Rosenberg. She says the woman 
20101230144910.150|20101230144912.012|TR0|refuses to believe she's going 
20101230144912.012|20101230144913.873|TR0|to die, insists she is innocent. 
20101230144913.873|20101230144915.735|TR0|State troopers surround the 
20101230144915.735|20101230144917.596|TR0|prison to prevent 
20101230144917.596|20101230144919.458|TR0|demonstrations. Again, there are 
20101230144919.458|20101230144921.320|TR0|none. The hours pass slowly. 
20101230144921.320|20101230144923.181|TR0|Julius Rosenberg, now 35, his 
20101230144923.181|20101230144925.043|TR0|wife Ethel, now 37, married 14 
20101230144925.043|20101230144926.904|TR0|years and one day, parents of 
20101230144926.904|20101230144928.766|TR0|two boys, tonight dined on 
20101230144928.766|20101230144930.628|TR0|hard-boiled eggs, macaroni salad 
20101230144930.628|20101230144932.489|TR0|and tea. There was no time for 
20101230144932.489|20101230144934.351|TR0|the usual last meal. Their fate 
20101230144934.351|20101230144936.212|TR0|is decided in Washington. And 
20101230144936.212|20101230144938.074|TR0|here is that story from David

20101230144941.797|20101230144943.659|TR0|>> DAVID BRINKLEY: In these last 
20101230144943.659|20101230144945.520|TR0|minutes before the Rosenbergs 
20101230144945.520|20101230144947.382|TR0|are electrocuted at Sing Sing 
20101230144947.382|20101230144949.244|TR0|Prison, here's how in Washington 
20101230144949.244|20101230144951.105|TR0|today their attorneys went 
20101230144951.105|20101230144952.967|TR0|through the last possible legal 
20101230144952.967|20101230144954.828|TR0|maneuvers to save them. It began 
20101230144954.828|20101230144956.690|TR0|at noon at the Supreme Court, 
20101230144956.690|20101230144958.552|TR0|normally quiet, but today 
20101230144958.552|20101230145000.413|TR0|surrounded by groups of the 
20101230145000.413|20101230145002.275|TR0|curious. The Court met at noon. 
20101230145002.275|20101230145004.136|TR0|At 12:06, it announced the 
20101230145004.136|20101230145005.998|TR0|decision to end the Rosenbergs' 
20101230145005.998|20101230145007.859|TR0|stay of execution. That was a 
20101230145007.859|20101230145009.721|TR0|stay granted two days ago by 
20101230145009.721|20101230145011.583|TR0|Justice Douglas. That seemed to 
20101230145011.583|20101230145013.444|TR0|be the end, but it wasn't. Their 
20101230145013.444|20101230145015.306|TR0|attorneys promptly asked for 
20101230145015.306|20101230145017.167|TR0|another stay while they appeal 
20101230145017.167|20101230145019.029|TR0|to President Eisenhower again 
20101230145019.029|20101230145020.891|TR0|for clemency. The Court said it 
20101230145020.891|20101230145022.752|TR0|would consider it.
20101230145022.752|20101230145024.614|TR0|
20101230145024.614|20101230145026.475|TR0|Meanwhile, a lobbyist who came 
20101230145026.475|20101230145028.337|TR0|to Washington to work for the 
20101230145028.337|20101230145030.199|TR0|Rosenbergs kept up their parade 
20101230145030.199|20101230145032.060|TR0|in front of the White House. 
20101230145032.060|20101230145033.922|TR0|People riding by in automobiles 
20101230145033.922|20101230145035.783|TR0|shouted and asked why they 
20101230145035.783|20101230145037.645|TR0|didn't go to Russia. But there 
20101230145037.645|20101230145039.507|TR0|was no other disorder, so the 
20101230145039.507|20101230145041.368|TR0|police left them alone. They 
20101230145041.368|20101230145043.230|TR0|even sang a little song somebody 
20101230145043.230|20101230145045.091|TR0|wrote especially for this 
20101230145045.091|20101230145046.953|TR0|occasion. But the picketing and 
20101230145046.953|20101230145048.815|TR0|singing did them no good, 
20101230145048.815|20101230145050.676|TR0|because at the Supreme Court, by 
20101230145050.676|20101230145052.538|TR0|this time, the government's 
20101230145052.538|20101230145054.399|TR0|lawyers, having won their case, 
20101230145054.399|20101230145056.261|TR0|were leaving. The Court had 
20101230145056.261|20101230145058.123|TR0|refused again to delay the 
20101230145058.123|20101230145059.984|TR0|execution. A few minutes later, 
20101230145059.984|20101230145101.846|TR0|Emanuel Bloch, chief counsel, 
20101230145101.846|20101230145103.707|TR0|came out, read us a telegram he 
20101230145103.707|20101230145105.569|TR0|had sent to the President.
20101230145105.569|20101230145107.431|TR0|
20101230145107.431|20101230145109.292|TR0|>> EMANUEL BLOCH: For sake of 
20101230145109.292|20101230145111.154|TR0|American tradition, prestige and 
20101230145111.154|20101230145113.015|TR0|influence, urge redress for 
20101230145113.015|20101230145114.877|TR0|Rosenbergs, demand you be 
20101230145114.877|20101230145116.738|TR0|afforded sufficient time to 
20101230145116.738|20101230145118.600|TR0|consider this serious matter.

20101230145122.323|20101230145124.185|TR0|President's answer came quickly.

20101230145133.493|20101230145135.354|TR0|statement just issued by the

20101230145137.216|20101230145139.078|TR0|"I am convinced that the only 
20101230145139.078|20101230145140.939|TR0|conclusion to be drawn from the 
20101230145140.939|20101230145142.801|TR0|history of this case is that the 
20101230145142.801|20101230145144.662|TR0|Rosenbergs have received the 
20101230145144.662|20101230145146.524|TR0|benefit of every safeguard which 
20101230145146.524|20101230145148.386|TR0|American justice can provide. 
20101230145148.386|20101230145150.247|TR0|There is no question in my mind

20101230145153.970|20101230145155.832|TR0|constitute the fullest measure

20101230145201.417|20101230145203.278|TR0|of this case no judge has ever 
20101230145203.278|20101230145205.140|TR0|expressed any doubt that they 
20101230145205.140|20101230145207.002|TR0|committed most serious acts of 
20101230145207.002|20101230145208.863|TR0|espionage. Accordingly, only

20101230145210.725|20101230145212.586|TR0|could warrant executive

20101230145319.604|20101230145321.465|TR0|she had received enough 
20101230145321.465|20101230145323.327|TR0|electricity to kill an ordinary 
20101230145323.327|20101230145325.189|TR0|person and had received the

20101230145328.912|20101230145330.773|TR0|and pulled down the cheap prison 
20101230145330.773|20101230145332.635|TR0|dress, a little dark green 
20101230145332.635|20101230145334.497|TR0|printed job, and placed the

20101230145336.358|20101230145338.220|TR0|placed the stethoscopes to her 
20101230145338.220|20101230145340.081|TR0|and then looked around and 
20101230145340.081|20101230145341.943|TR0|looked at each other, rather 
20101230145341.943|20101230145343.804|TR0|dumbfounded, and seemed 
20101230145343.804|20101230145345.666|TR0|surprised that she was not dead.

20101230145347.528|20101230145349.389|TR0|attendants had taken off the

20101230145354.974|20101230145356.836|TR0|readjusted again, and she was 
20101230145356.836|20101230145358.697|TR0|given more electricity, which 
20101230145358.697|20101230145400.559|TR0|started again a kind of a

20101230145402.420|20101230145404.282|TR0|from her head and went up

20101230145434.068|20101230145435.929|TR0|boy at the time of this ghastly 
20101230145435.929|20101230145437.791|TR0|description. I'm wondering, your 
20101230145437.791|20101230145439.652|TR0|response? And also, as new 
20101230145439.652|20101230145441.514|TR0|evidence has emerged of - 
20101230145441.514|20101230145443.376|TR0|indicating that your parents 
20101230145443.376|20101230145445.237|TR0|were not involved in - certainly 
20101230145445.237|20101230145447.099|TR0|in espionage toward - of sending 
20101230145447.099|20101230145448.960|TR0|atomic secrets to the Russians, 
20101230145448.960|20101230145450.822|TR0|and that your mother was 
20101230145450.822|20101230145452.684|TR0|completely innocent. Your sense?
20101230145452.684|20101230145454.545|TR0|
20101230145454.545|20101230145456.407|TR0|>> ROBERT MEEROPOL: Well, first 
20101230145456.407|20101230145458.268|TR0|of all, you know, I'm sure it's 
20101230145458.268|20101230145500.130|TR0|- it's always hard for me to 
20101230145500.130|20101230145501.991|TR0|hear Bob Considine's 
20101230145501.991|20101230145503.853|TR0|description, to relive the last 
20101230145503.853|20101230145505.715|TR0|day of my parents' lives. And 
20101230145505.715|20101230145507.576|TR0|people may wonder, you know, how 
20101230145507.576|20101230145509.438|TR0|I can react in such a cool and 
20101230145509.438|20101230145511.299|TR0|calm manner. I mean, part of it 
20101230145511.299|20101230145513.161|TR0|is, is I've dedicated my life, 
20101230145513.161|20101230145515.023|TR0|through the Rosenberg Fund for 
20101230145515.023|20101230145516.884|TR0|Children, to providing for the 
20101230145516.884|20101230145518.746|TR0|educational and emotional needs 
20101230145518.746|20101230145520.607|TR0|of the children of targeted 
20101230145520.607|20101230145522.469|TR0|activists in the United States, 
20101230145522.469|20101230145524.331|TR0|my people who I consider kindred 
20101230145524.331|20101230145526.192|TR0|spirits, people suffering what 
20101230145526.192|20101230145528.054|TR0|I've suffered. And that, finding 
20101230145528.054|20101230145529.915|TR0|that positive outlet for my 
20101230145529.915|20101230145531.777|TR0|grief and rage and anger, has 
20101230145531.777|20101230145533.639|TR0|really enabled me, again, to 
20101230145533.639|20101230145535.500|TR0|respond in a positive manner.
20101230145535.500|20101230145537.362|TR0|
20101230145537.362|20101230145539.223|TR0|That said, I think it's very 
20101230145539.223|20101230145541.085|TR0|fitting that you focused on my 
20101230145541.085|20101230145542.947|TR0|mother, particularly in the 
20101230145542.947|20101230145544.808|TR0|context of the charges that 
20101230145544.808|20101230145546.670|TR0|Julian Assange may face, and 
20101230145546.670|20101230145548.531|TR0|that is conspiracy. My mother 
20101230145548.531|20101230145550.393|TR0|was involved in this case 
20101230145550.393|20101230145552.255|TR0|because she was deemed or dubbed 
20101230145552.255|20101230145554.116|TR0|a conspirator. She was convicted 
20101230145554.116|20101230145555.978|TR0|of conspiracy to commit 
20101230145555.978|20101230145557.839|TR0|espionage. All that means is 
20101230145557.839|20101230145559.701|TR0|that - all that "conspiracy" 
20101230145559.701|20101230145601.563|TR0|means is that two for more 
20101230145601.563|20101230145603.424|TR0|people got together and planned 
20101230145603.424|20101230145605.286|TR0|to commit an illegal act and 
20101230145605.286|20101230145607.147|TR0|took one step in furtherance of 
20101230145607.147|20101230145609.009|TR0|that plan - could be a phone 
20101230145609.009|20101230145610.871|TR0|call, could be a conversation. 
20101230145610.871|20101230145612.732|TR0|Well, that was used in my 
20101230145612.732|20101230145614.594|TR0|parents' case. My parents' chief 
20101230145614.594|20101230145616.455|TR0|accusers, David and Ruth 
20101230145616.455|20101230145618.317|TR0|Greenglass, testified that my 
20101230145618.317|20101230145620.178|TR0|mother was present during the 
20101230145620.178|20101230145622.040|TR0|critical espionage meeting, and 
20101230145622.040|20101230145623.902|TR0|she typed up David Greenglass's 
20101230145623.902|20101230145625.763|TR0|handwritten notes, descriptions 
20101230145625.763|20101230145627.625|TR0|of a sketch, that supposedly 
20101230145627.625|20101230145629.486|TR0|gave away the secret of the 
20101230145629.486|20101230145631.348|TR0|atomic bomb. Well, it's come out 
20101230145631.348|20101230145633.210|TR0|since that this testimony was 
20101230145633.210|20101230145635.071|TR0|false and that David Greenglass 
20101230145635.071|20101230145636.933|TR0|himself has even admitted that. 
20101230145636.933|20101230145638.794|TR0|But even if it were true, that 
20101230145638.794|20101230145640.656|TR0|would mean that the United 
20101230145640.656|20101230145642.518|TR0|States government executed 
20101230145642.518|20101230145644.379|TR0|someone for typing.
20101230145644.379|20101230145646.241|TR0|
20101230145646.241|20101230145648.102|TR0|Now, but it's not surprising 
20101230145648.102|20101230145649.964|TR0|that the government would use 
20101230145649.964|20101230145651.826|TR0|conspiracy, whether it's against 
20101230145651.826|20101230145653.687|TR0|my parents or whether it's 
20101230145653.687|20101230145655.549|TR0|against the WikiLeaks people, 
20101230145655.549|20101230145657.410|TR0|because if you're anybody who 
20101230145657.410|20101230145659.272|TR0|engages in conversation or 
20101230145659.272|20101230145701.134|TR0|discussion, and the government 
20101230145701.134|20101230145702.995|TR0|can get one person to testify 
20101230145702.995|20101230145704.857|TR0|that that discussion was to leak 
20101230145704.857|20101230145706.718|TR0|classified material, or to 
20101230145706.718|20101230145708.580|TR0|transmit information to the 
20101230145708.580|20101230145710.442|TR0|Soviet Union, in my parents 
20101230145710.442|20101230145712.303|TR0|case, they could be swept up in 
20101230145712.303|20101230145714.165|TR0|the dragnet. And you could get 
20101230145714.165|20101230145716.026|TR0|people to rat out their friends 
20101230145716.026|20101230145717.888|TR0|in order to get more lenient 
20101230145717.888|20101230145719.750|TR0|sentences. It sows distrust 
20101230145719.750|20101230145721.611|TR0|among the community of support. 
20101230145721.611|20101230145723.473|TR0|It scares other people into 
20101230145723.473|20101230145725.334|TR0|silence.
20101230145725.334|20101230145727.196|TR0|
20101230145727.196|20101230145729.057|TR0|And so, what we see here is, if 
20101230145729.057|20101230145730.919|TR0|there is a criminal indictment 
20101230145730.919|20101230145732.781|TR0|for conspiracy, not an attack on 
20101230145732.781|20101230145734.642|TR0|just Julian Assange himself, but 
20101230145734.642|20101230145736.504|TR0|on the entire community of 
20101230145736.504|20101230145738.365|TR0|support that is seeking to 
20101230145738.365|20101230145740.227|TR0|promote the very revolutionary 
20101230145740.227|20101230145742.089|TR0|idea that the people have the 
20101230145742.089|20101230145743.950|TR0|right to know what their 
20101230145743.950|20101230145745.812|TR0|government is doing, that's what 
20101230145745.812|20101230145747.673|TR0|this ultimately is all about. 
20101230145747.673|20101230145749.535|TR0|And every left-wing, every 
20101230145749.535|20101230145751.397|TR0|progressive organizer, every 
20101230145751.397|20101230145753.258|TR0|organizer, in general  --  how 
20101230145753.258|20101230145755.120|TR0|can you engage in organizing, in 
20101230145755.120|20101230145756.981|TR0|getting groups of people to 
20101230145756.981|20101230145758.843|TR0|protest and coordinating 
20101230145758.843|20101230145800.705|TR0|activities, without engaging in 
20101230145800.705|20101230145802.566|TR0|what the government would term a 
20101230145802.566|20101230145804.428|TR0|conspiracy? And so, it is a 
20101230145804.428|20101230145806.289|TR0|threat to all of us. And that is 
20101230145806.289|20101230145808.151|TR0|really why I issued my call for 
20101230145808.151|20101230145810.013|TR0|us to recognize this. This 
20101230145810.013|20101230145811.874|TR0|Espionage Act of 1917 has been 
20101230145811.874|20101230145813.736|TR0|the sword of Damocles, sitting 
20101230145813.736|20101230145815.597|TR0|quietly, mostly unused, ready to 
20101230145815.597|20101230145817.459|TR0|spring out and attack 
20101230145817.459|20101230145819.321|TR0|dissenters. And when you have it 
20101230145819.321|20101230145821.182|TR0|in the context of the growing 
20101230145821.182|20101230145823.044|TR0|secrecy that we face today  --
20101230145823.044|20101230145824.905|TR0|
20101230145824.905|20101230145826.767|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: We have five 
20101230145826.767|20101230145828.629|TR0|seconds.
20101230145828.629|20101230145830.490|TR0|
20101230145830.490|20101230145832.352|TR0|>> ROBERT MEEROPOL: - and an 
20101230145832.352|20101230145834.213|TR0|authoritarian-oriented Supreme 
20101230145834.213|20101230145836.075|TR0|Court, it is a danger to us all.

20101230145837.937|20101230145839.798|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Robert Meeropol, 
20101230145839.798|20101230145841.660|TR0|we want to thank you very much 
20101230145841.660|20101230145843.521|TR0|for being with us, younger son
