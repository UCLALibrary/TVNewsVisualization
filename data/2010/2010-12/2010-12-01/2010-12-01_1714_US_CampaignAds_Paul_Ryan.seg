20101201171401.030|20101201172030.909|TR1|first off ob bella think donors can you guys have been a tremendous job a very difficult challenge and i got a lot on your latin bruce u_n_ your staff skeleton staff we've must i must have been in budgets for a long time he has done a great job i want to just take a digression for seconds that i think this is a time i'll be sitting at a table of my friend john spratt and arm near a great guy john and i'd federal privilege to serve in congress of the win the greed and everything but umm on you and i respect that is going to say thank you for what you've done for a country they keep arguing this commission has been a success those refused to confront the challenges uh... facing us they have nowhere else to hide if they labeled various proposals is too draconian or a steer well they're going to come up with their own right now and so this anything this has been successful because it has helped us move this conversation to more toward the adult level than it needed to go to you regardless of what happens regardless of whether you get these fourteen votes are not you should go home proud of what you've done to advances debates input ideas on the table we have a choice which is are we getting confront this and leave a missionary shatter offer not i'll read the reviews about how to do that but you've done a lot advance that debate let me go com i'll try to be brief i go through what i do like about this because i think it's important to see some positive things ob i do like the fact that worst seeming to get some consensus on taxes revenue levels but on rates lower rates with a broader tax base leads to economic growth and job creation an international competitiveness if anything i think than that the concept that tax reform ought to be merged budget reform is something that is incredibly important the best way to deal with this problem in my opinion is spending control reform economic growth and economic growth comes from and more competitive tax system a broader tax base more rates and two that you have done a great job in inventing this debate i like the budget process reforms are some really good by the process reforms in this bill are not as many as jeff and i and others had put out there but some great budget process reforms arms particularly what we call our belts and suspenders approach discretionary caps i think that's pretty good social security and i don't like every single idealists of cheery form but you've really advance the ball and gotten us toward a better conversation on making socially solvent engine is right this does not contribute toward debt deficit reduction but solvency to such a cutie which is really important we don't do anything we're out of i'll use everybody gets twenty percent across the board benefit cut that ought to be avoided discretionary savings in your albeit is not as many as i would like that occurring as soon as i would like but you're moving the ball forward on the fact that we can't keep growing discretionary spending like we have one or both parties leadership around here prompt so what i wanted this basically say that there are some ideas in here that i think are worth copying and borrowing and putting into this next year's budget which i fully intend to do what are my concerns myb primary concern with this plan is health care uh... i do not believe that this sufficiently fixes the health care problem and guess what our debt problem is the health care problem uh... g_a_o_ just gave us a new number week or two ago that says we haven't eighty eight point six trillion dollar unfunded liability primarily stemming stemming from our federal health care programs this doesn't sufficiently address that in my opinion uh... i think senator republican right we are hastening the day when the only option is the public option i think you're right and i think this advance is that possibility likelihood that's when the reads well you have a problem with it bum let me go to taxes or more importantly baselines as you know we look as spending cuts and revenue increases from any reform in washington you have to do so relative to a baseline now based on conversations can get really esoteric they can get very confusing buddy really actually kind of matters bump it's important to stem what baselines being used and so uh... we stayed up pretty late less i going to these numbers as my understanding of the based on your using in rough terms follows the president's budget both revenues in in spending uh... the president's budget increases revenues by not extending all tax relief i think that's something every knows about we think that leads to a tax increase of about nine or eighty three billion dollars uh... he also include increases obeys defense non-defense spending it does not oppose offset the doc fix which leads an increase in spending now to be clear this is another way of looking at these issues but using this baseline and excluding debt service this proposal cut spending by about two dollars for every one dollar and revenue increases under a baseline that i would consider more plausible of a c_b_o_ based current policy baseline these numbers would roughly be reversed about two dollars in tax increases for one dollar spending cuts is how we look at these numbers uh... i would like to share this with your staff and maybe we can go through these before friday uh... but it's important to note think that we've gotta grow this economy and we got to get a good dumping on taxes and spending and spending excuse me now and you really can't fix this problem here just delaying it if you don't really tackle health care and i understand the position you are putting you're the president's appointees to create this commission and he just passed through a health care law that i'm sure you weren't weren't going to want to undo and i understand that uh... but that doesn't mean that those of us who have a problem with that law uh... want to sign up for something that we thank you alm advances that law uh... and that's why i some of us has some concerns but let me finish a positive note you were to be commended this is a serious effort c serious proposal it is advance the debate and i really appreciate you for the contributions that you and all my fault consummate thank you it before thank you you'd been extremely constructive they have become a real of the bar has i think you know it's affected for all your
