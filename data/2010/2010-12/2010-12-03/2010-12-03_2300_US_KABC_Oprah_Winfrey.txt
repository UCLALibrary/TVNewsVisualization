20101203235016.000|20101203235017.667|CCO|MEDIA, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT

20101203235023.857|20101203235025.286|CCO|YOU MIGHT HAVE REASON TO THINK
20101203235025.286|20101203235026.714|CCO|THAT. BECAUSE WHO THINKS THAT 12
20101203235026.714|20101203235028.143|CCO|JURORS ARE GOING TO GO HOME,
20101203235028.143|20101203235029.571|CCO|NOBODY'S GOING TO DISCUSS IT

20101203235037.000|20101203235039.000|CCO|>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. THAT 
20101203235039.000|20101203235041.000|CCO|BROKE MY HEART, WATCHING HER
20101203235041.000|20101203235043.500|CCO|THERE. I REALLY FELT FOR HER,
20101203235043.500|20101203235046.000|CCO|AND AGAIN, I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR
20101203235046.000|20101203235048.500|CCO|MYSELF IN THAT BEFORE THE TRIAL,
20101203235048.500|20101203235051.000|CCO|I WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY, SO I

20101203235055.000|20101203235057.000|CCO|NEVER TALKED TO ANYBODY, AND I
20101203235057.000|20101203235059.000|CCO|FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE

20101203235103.500|20101203235106.000|CCO|AND I KEPT IT. SO I DON'T KNOW
20101203235106.000|20101203235108.500|CCO|IF IT MAKES HER FEEL ANY BETTER
20101203235108.500|20101203235111.000|CCO|THAT I DON'T KNOW ANY EXAMPLE OF

20101203235112.667|20101203235114.333|CCO|OUT OF SCHOOL OR--EVEN IN THE 
20101203235114.333|20101203235116.000|CCO|JURY ROOM, WE DIDN'T TALK
20101203235116.000|20101203235117.667|CCO|BETWEEN BREAKS. WE NEVER SAID

20101203235119.333|20101203235121.000|CCO|TRANSPIRED IN THE COURTROOM.
20101203235121.000|20101203235123.000|CCO|OPRAH: WHAT WAS THE MAIN PIECE
20101203235123.000|20101203235125.000|CCO|OF EVIDENCE THAT YOU CAN RECALL
20101203235125.000|20101203235127.000|CCO|THAT CAUSED YOU TO SAY, "YES,

20101203235129.000|20101203235131.000|CCO|CONSPIRACY TO KILL HER
20101203235131.000|20101203235133.500|CCO|HUSBAND"?
20101203235133.500|20101203235136.000|CCO|>> I THINK IT WAS THE TAPES THAT
20101203235136.000|20101203235138.500|CCO|WERE MADE BY HER FRIEND. THEY
20101203235138.500|20101203235141.000|CCO|WERE VERY DAMNING. THERE WAS THE
20101203235141.000|20101203235143.000|CCO|TESTIMONY OF THE BOYS, BUT I
20101203235143.000|20101203235145.000|CCO|THINK A LOT OF US FOUND THEM--WE
20101203235145.000|20101203235147.000|CCO|JUST FOUND SO DISTASTEFUL WHAT
20101203235147.000|20101203235149.000|CCO|THEY HAD DONE, IT WAS HARD FOR
20101203235149.000|20101203235151.000|CCO|US TO TAKE THEIR TESTIMONY
20101203235151.000|20101203235152.667|CCO|SERIOUSLY, BUT THE TAPES
20101203235152.667|20101203235154.333|CCO|THEMSELVES, I THINK, WE FOUND 
20101203235154.333|20101203235156.000|CCO|VERY DAMNING.
20101203235156.000|20101203235157.667|CCO|OPRAH: SO WHEN YOU AND THE JURY
20101203235157.667|20101203235159.333|CCO|CONVICTED HER, YOU HAD NO IDEA
20101203235159.333|20101203235201.000|CCO|OF WHAT THE SENTENCING WOULD
20101203235201.000|20101203235203.000|CCO|BE--THERE WOULD BE LIFE WITHOUT 
20101203235203.000|20101203235205.000|CCO|PAROLE--IS THAT CORRECT?
20101203235205.000|20101203235207.000|CCO|>> YEAH, THAT'S TRUE. WHEN WE 
20101203235207.000|20101203235209.000|CCO|RENDERED OUR VERDICT, THE JUDGE
20101203235209.000|20101203235211.000|CCO|CAME IN AND TOLD US THAT, AND IT
20101203235211.000|20101203235213.000|CCO|WAS ACTUALLY CHILLING TO HEAR
20101203235213.000|20101203235215.000|CCO|THAT NEWS, BECAUSE THAT 
20101203235215.000|20101203235217.000|CCO|INFORMATION HAD BEEN KEPT FROM
20101203235217.000|20101203235219.000|CCO|US. OUR JOB WAS TO RENDER THE 
20101203235219.000|20101203235221.000|CCO|VERDICT ON THE EVIDENCE, AND THE
20101203235221.000|20101203235222.429|CCO|SENTENCE WAS NOT OUR CONCERN. SO
20101203235222.429|20101203235223.857|CCO|IT WAS DEFINITELY CHILLING TO

20101203235225.286|20101203235226.714|CCO|OPTION, AND ESPECIALLY
20101203235226.714|20101203235228.143|CCO|CONSIDERING THAT THE BOYS WOULD

20101203235229.571|20101203235231.000|CCO|POINT.
20101203235231.000|20101203235233.000|CCO|OPRAH: IS IT FAIR THAT THE GUYS
20101203235233.000|20101203235235.000|CCO|WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER GET OUT
20101203235235.000|20101203235237.000|CCO|OF JAIL AND SHE IS, YOU KNOW, IN

20101203235241.000|20101203235243.500|CCO|>> NO, TO ME PERSONALLY, IT 
20101203235243.500|20101203235246.000|CCO|DOESN'T FEEL FAIR, BUT I GUESS
20101203235246.000|20101203235248.500|CCO|IT'S JUST THE SYSTEM WE HAVE.
20101203235248.500|20101203235251.000|CCO|THEY'RE THE ONES WHO CUT THE
20101203235251.000|20101203235252.667|CCO|DEAL. IF SHE HAD CUT THE DEAL, I
20101203235252.667|20101203235254.333|CCO|SUSPECT THEY WOULD STILL BE IN
20101203235254.333|20101203235256.000|CCO|JAIL RIGHT NOW, AND SHE WOULD BE
20101203235256.000|20101203235257.667|CCO|GETTING OUT.
20101203235257.667|20101203235259.333|CCO|OPRAH: DO YOU FEEL THAT, HAD THE

20101203235305.286|20101203235306.714|CCO|>> I THINK PROBABLY. I
20101203235306.714|20101203235308.143|CCO|THINK--YOU COULD REALLY FEEL THE

20101203235309.571|20101203235311.000|CCO|RESPONSIBILITY WE HAD, AND WE
