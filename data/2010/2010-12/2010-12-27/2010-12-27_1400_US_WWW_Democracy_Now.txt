20101227141041.676|20101227141043.423|TR0|want to talk to you about what's 
20101227141043.423|20101227141045.169|TR0|happening throughout the East 
20101227141045.169|20101227141046.915|TR0|Coast. It has been remarkable, 
20101227141046.915|20101227141048.661|TR0|the last two days of this 
20101227141048.661|20101227141050.408|TR0|blizzard, a state of emergency 
20101227141050.408|20101227141052.154|TR0|declared in, among other states, 
20101227141052.154|20101227141053.900|TR0|Virginia, as well North 
20101227141053.900|20101227141055.647|TR0|Carolina. I think that Atlanta 
20101227141055.647|20101227141057.393|TR0|and, what, Raleigh-Durham has 
20101227141057.393|20101227141059.139|TR0|seen snow for the first time in 
20101227141059.139|20101227141100.885|TR0|its history on Christmas. And 
20101227141100.885|20101227141102.632|TR0|here in New York, well, the city 
20101227141102.632|20101227141104.378|TR0|is blanketed. People are warned 
20101227141104.378|20101227141106.124|TR0|to stay home. But I do have to 
20101227141106.124|20101227141107.870|TR0|thank the staff of Democracy 
20101227141107.870|20101227141109.617|TR0|Now!, who somehow, by hook or by 
20101227141109.617|20101227141111.363|TR0|crook, made it to the studios to 
20101227141111.363|20101227141113.109|TR0|make sure that this broadcast 
20101227141113.109|20101227141114.856|TR0|took place. Well, here, we start 
20101227141114.856|20101227141116.602|TR0|with my colleague Sharif.
20101227141116.602|20101227141118.348|TR0|
20101227141118.348|20101227141120.094|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Sharif, senior 
20101227141120.094|20101227141121.841|TR0|producer, how did you get here 
20101227141121.841|20101227141123.587|TR0|this morning? Most people are 
20101227141123.587|20101227141125.333|TR0|not working in Manhattan.
20101227141125.333|20101227141127.080|TR0|
20101227141127.080|20101227141128.826|TR0|>> SHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Well, 
20101227141128.826|20101227141130.572|TR0|Amy, after I walked out of the 
20101227141130.572|20101227141132.318|TR0|building, the snow was 
20101227141132.318|20101227141134.065|TR0|knee-high. I had to force the 
20101227141134.065|20101227141135.811|TR0|door open. And we trudged 
20101227141135.811|20101227141137.557|TR0|through the snow to the 
20101227141137.557|20101227141139.304|TR0|Williamsburg Bridge, where I 
20101227141139.304|20101227141141.050|TR0|hitchhiked, and I got a ride 
20101227141141.050|20101227141142.796|TR0|from - actually, I have his card 
20101227141142.796|20101227141144.542|TR0|here, a very nice guy, John 
20101227141144.542|20101227141146.289|TR0|Ramirez, who works at Citigroup. 
20101227141146.289|20101227141148.035|TR0|He drove us across the bridge. 
20101227141148.035|20101227141149.781|TR0|And then, from there, I had to 
20101227141149.781|20101227141151.528|TR0|walk and found another cab to 
20101227141151.528|20101227141153.274|TR0|take us uptown. There was cars 
20101227141153.274|20101227141155.020|TR0|sliding all over the place. 
20101227141155.020|20101227141156.766|TR0|There were snowplows trying to 
20101227141156.766|20101227141158.513|TR0|begin to clear the city. But it 
20101227141158.513|20101227141200.259|TR0|was one of the most difficult 
20101227141200.259|20101227141202.005|TR0|days I've had getting to work.
20101227141202.005|20101227141203.752|TR0|
20101227141203.752|20101227141205.498|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I am glad you 
20101227141205.498|20101227141207.244|TR0|made it. So, Flip, how did you 
20101227141207.244|20101227141208.990|TR0|get in today?
20101227141208.990|20101227141210.737|TR0|
20101227141210.737|20101227141212.483|TR0|>> MIKE DIFILIPPO: I got in on a 
20101227141212.483|20101227141214.229|TR0|bicycle.
20101227141214.229|20101227141215.976|TR0|
20101227141215.976|20101227141217.722|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Why doesn't it 
20101227141217.722|20101227141219.468|TR0|surprise me that you made it, no 
20101227141219.468|20101227141221.214|TR0|matter where you are? So, this 
20101227141221.214|20101227141222.961|TR0|is your bicycle?
20101227141222.961|20101227141224.707|TR0|
20101227141224.707|20101227141226.453|TR0|>> MIKE DIFILIPPO: Yeah.
20101227141226.453|20101227141228.200|TR0|
20101227141228.200|20101227141229.946|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And most people 
20101227141229.946|20101227141231.692|TR0|would not have ridden a bike to 
20101227141231.692|20101227141233.438|TR0|work in one of the biggest 
20101227141233.438|20101227141235.185|TR0|snowstorms in our history.
20101227141235.185|20101227141236.931|TR0|
20101227141236.931|20101227141238.677|TR0|>> MIKE DIFILIPPO: No, but it 
20101227141238.677|20101227141240.423|TR0|was actually pretty easy. I 
20101227141240.423|20101227141242.170|TR0|followed the plows, and it was 
20101227141242.170|20101227141243.916|TR0|just easy. We just rolled right 
20101227141243.916|20101227141245.662|TR0|down 9th Ave. Wasn't that bad a 
20101227141245.662|20101227141247.409|TR0|ride at all.
20101227141247.409|20101227141249.155|TR0|
20101227141249.155|20101227141250.901|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, thanks for 
20101227141250.901|20101227141252.647|TR0|making it.
20101227141252.647|20101227141254.394|TR0|
20101227141254.394|20101227141256.140|TR0|>> MIKE DIFILIPPO: And police 
20101227141256.140|20101227141257.886|TR0|thought that was a good idea, 
20101227141257.886|20101227141259.633|TR0|too. They were all - as they 
20101227141259.633|20101227141301.379|TR0|were pushing their cars and 
20101227141301.379|20101227141303.125|TR0|those little three-wheel things, 
20101227141303.125|20101227141304.871|TR0|they were trying to push one of 
20101227141304.871|20101227141306.618|TR0|them out, and I just rode by 
20101227141306.618|20101227141308.364|TR0|with a bicycle. And it was kind 
20101227141308.364|20101227141310.110|TR0|of humorous. So I was like, 
20101227141310.110|20101227141311.857|TR0|"Sorry, officers, I can't help 
20101227141311.857|20101227141313.603|TR0|you push."
20101227141313.603|20101227141315.349|TR0|
20101227141315.349|20101227141317.095|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Green is always 
20101227141317.095|20101227141318.842|TR0|a dream. So, it was easier than 
20101227141318.842|20101227141320.588|TR0|the blackout?
20101227141320.588|20101227141322.334|TR0|
20101227141322.334|20101227141324.081|TR0|>> MIKE DIFILIPPO: Oh, yeah, way 
20101227141324.081|20101227141325.827|TR0|easier. Way easier. Way easier. 
20101227141325.827|20101227141327.573|TR0|It wasn't like crazy things, 
20101227141327.573|20101227141329.319|TR0|so...
20101227141329.319|20101227141331.066|TR0|
20101227141331.066|20101227141332.812|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, thanks so 
20101227141332.812|20101227141334.558|TR0|much, Flip. OK, so here we come 
20101227141334.558|20101227141336.305|TR0|up to the people behind the 
20101227141336.305|20101227141338.051|TR0|scenes who make this show 
20101227141338.051|20101227141339.797|TR0|happen. OK, now, Hugh Gran, 
20101227141339.797|20101227141341.543|TR0|where did you come from, and how 
20101227141341.543|20101227141343.290|TR0|did you make it? You're still 
20101227141343.290|20101227141345.036|TR0|wearing scarf and hat.
20101227141345.036|20101227141346.782|TR0|
20101227141346.782|20101227141348.529|TR0|>> HUGH GRAN: Yeah. I took the E 
20101227141348.529|20101227141350.275|TR0|train, which is running, on West 
20101227141350.275|20101227141352.021|TR0|4th Street and got off at 23rd. 
20101227141352.021|20101227141353.767|TR0|So I'm very lucky.
20101227141353.767|20101227141355.514|TR0|
20101227141355.514|20101227141357.260|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: But you brought 
20101227141357.260|20101227141359.006|TR0|your entire snowman's outfit.
20101227141359.006|20101227141400.753|TR0|
20101227141400.753|20101227141402.499|TR0|>> HUGH GRAN: Yep, yep.
20101227141402.499|20101227141404.245|TR0|
20101227141404.245|20101227141405.991|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: I see you were 
20101227141405.991|20101227141407.738|TR0|completely ready.
20101227141407.738|20101227141409.484|TR0|
20101227141409.484|20101227141411.230|TR0|>> HUGH GRAN: I was ready to 
20101227141411.230|20101227141412.976|TR0|troop it, but I didn't have to, 
20101227141412.976|20101227141414.723|TR0|thank God.
20101227141414.723|20101227141416.469|TR0|
20101227141416.469|20101227141418.215|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Now, Elizabeth,

20101227141552.515|20101227141554.261|TR0|take the day off. And I was 
20101227141554.261|20101227141556.007|TR0|going to - I was going to take 
20101227141556.007|20101227141557.753|TR0|the day off. He was going to 
20101227141557.753|20101227141559.500|TR0|come in, but last night we 
20101227141559.500|20101227141601.246|TR0|decided that that was a little 
20101227141601.246|20101227141602.992|TR0|bit impossible. So, rather than 
20101227141602.992|20101227141604.739|TR0|him come from there, I just 
20101227141604.739|20101227141606.485|TR0|walked and hitchhiked from

20101227141639.664|20101227141641.411|TR0|see. I slept for about an hour, 
20101227141641.411|20101227141643.157|TR0|and then Ms. Goodman gave me a 
20101227141643.157|20101227141644.903|TR0|call, just in time before I got 
20101227141644.903|20101227141646.649|TR0|into my third level of sleep.
20101227141646.649|20101227141648.396|TR0|
20101227141648.396|20101227141650.142|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And before you

20101227141651.888|20101227141653.635|TR0|were sleep - or is it sleet - 
20101227141653.635|20101227141655.381|TR0|walking?
20101227141655.381|20101227141657.127|TR0|

20101227141658.873|20101227141700.620|TR0|doing something. But the phone 
20101227141700.620|20101227141702.366|TR0|was ringing, and I answered by 
20101227141702.366|20101227141704.112|TR0|mistake, I guess. It was a 
20101227141704.112|20101227141705.859|TR0|natural instinct. So I - let's 
20101227141705.859|20101227141707.605|TR0|see. What did I do? So I walked 
20101227141707.605|20101227141709.351|TR0|across 116th Street, because the 
20101227141709.351|20101227141711.097|TR0|6 train was kind of congested. 
20101227141711.097|20101227141712.844|TR0|So I walked to the second - to 
20101227141712.844|20101227141714.590|TR0|the 2 train line. I can't even 
20101227141714.590|20101227141716.336|TR0|speak straight, I'm so tired. I 
20101227141716.336|20101227141718.082|TR0|just walked to the 2 train and 
20101227141718.082|20101227141719.829|TR0|took it in. It wasn't too bad. 
20101227141719.829|20101227141721.575|TR0|It was a little slow, but it 
20101227141721.575|20101227141723.321|TR0|wasn't too bad.

20101227141735.545|20101227141737.292|TR0|>> HANY MASSOUD: I think it's 
20101227141737.292|20101227141739.038|TR0|almost there. I think 
20101227141739.038|20101227141740.784|TR0|everything's almost there, maybe 
20101227141740.784|20101227141742.530|TR0|a few headlines missing here and 
20101227141742.530|20101227141744.277|TR0|there. But overall, I think

20101227141859.367|20101227141901.113|TR0|snow to get over here.
20101227141901.113|20101227141902.859|TR0|
20101227141902.859|20101227141904.606|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And the subway?

20101227141906.352|20101227141908.098|TR0|>> KELLON INNOCENT: The subway? 
20101227141908.098|20101227141909.845|TR0|Well, I waited like half an hour 
20101227141909.845|20101227141911.591|TR0|for the train, and all the 
20101227141911.591|20101227141913.337|TR0|trains were local, so it took me 
20101227141913.337|20101227141915.083|TR0|forever to get down here.
20101227141915.083|20101227141916.830|TR0|

20101227141922.069|20101227141923.815|TR0|>> KELLON INNOCENT: Yeah, they 
20101227141923.815|20101227141925.561|TR0|were there.

20101227141927.307|20101227141929.054|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That's what 
20101227141929.054|20101227141930.800|TR0|counts.

20101227141941.278|20101227141943.024|TR0|>> KELLON INNOCENT: Yeah, that's 
20101227141943.024|20101227141944.770|TR0|what it was. Usually, my stop, 
20101227141944.770|20101227141946.517|TR0|there's like seats all around. 
20101227141946.517|20101227141948.263|TR0|But they - it was all packed up, 
20101227141948.263|20101227141950.009|TR0|early morning.
20101227141950.009|20101227141951.755|TR0|

20101227142005.726|20101227142007.472|TR0|Now, where did you come from?
20101227142007.472|20101227142009.218|TR0|

20101227142017.950|20101227142019.696|TR0|Manhattan?
20101227142019.696|20101227142021.442|TR0|
20101227142021.442|20101227142023.188|TR0|>> RAH CAMPENNI: Like ski 
20101227142023.188|20101227142024.935|TR0|Eskimos, you know, like the dogs 
20101227142024.935|20101227142026.681|TR0|and the dog sled.
20101227142026.681|20101227142028.427|TR0|

20101227142033.666|20101227142035.412|TR0|>> RAH CAMPENNI: It was 
20101227142035.412|20101227142037.159|TR0|post-apocalyptic. There was 
20101227142037.159|20101227142038.905|TR0|garbage trucks spun out, buried 
20101227142038.905|20101227142040.651|TR0|in snow. There were - people 
20101227142040.651|20101227142042.398|TR0|were just sleeping in their cars 
20101227142042.398|20101227142044.144|TR0|along the road. So there was 
20101227142044.144|20101227142045.890|TR0|like this line of cars in the 
20101227142045.890|20101227142047.636|TR0|street of New York Avenue, 
20101227142047.636|20101227142049.383|TR0|people just sleeping in them. 
20101227142049.383|20101227142051.129|TR0|They couldn't move anymore.
20101227142051.129|20101227142052.875|TR0|

20101227142106.846|20101227142108.592|TR0|streets in my neighborhood have 
20101227142108.592|20101227142110.338|TR0|been plowed, because the 
20101227142110.338|20101227142112.084|TR0|snowplows have gotten stuck. I 
20101227142112.084|20101227142113.831|TR0|don't know what time it got 
20101227142113.831|20101227142115.577|TR0|stuck, but it's as deep in the 
20101227142115.577|20101227142117.323|TR0|snow as anything else is.
20101227142117.323|20101227142119.070|TR0|
20101227142119.070|20101227142120.816|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: And then, once

20101227142138.279|20101227142140.025|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That's it. Where 
20101227142140.025|20101227142141.771|TR0|there is the A, there is a way.
20101227142141.771|20101227142143.518|TR0|
20101227142143.518|20101227142145.264|TR0|>> RAH CAMPENNI: That's right. 
20101227142145.264|20101227142147.010|TR0|So, MTA, I give them props, you 
20101227142147.010|20101227142148.756|TR0|know? Gotta give respect to the 
20101227142148.756|20101227142150.503|TR0|MTA.

20101227142157.488|20101227142159.234|TR0|>> RAH CAMPENNI: I figured I'd

20101227142200.980|20101227142202.727|TR0|wasn't going to let you down.
20101227142202.727|20101227142204.473|TR0|
20101227142204.473|20101227142206.219|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, a few of 
20101227142206.219|20101227142207.965|TR0|us thought we'd join you.
20101227142207.965|20101227142209.712|TR0|
20101227142209.712|20101227142211.458|TR0|Brenda, so, first of all, happy 
20101227142211.458|20101227142213.204|TR0|birthday. But what was it like? 
20101227142213.204|20101227142214.951|TR0|What was it like coming to work?
20101227142214.951|20101227142216.697|TR0|
20101227142216.697|20101227142218.443|TR0|>> BRENDA MURAD: It was - my 
20101227142218.443|20101227142220.189|TR0|entire street is snowed in. 
20101227142220.189|20101227142221.936|TR0|There are no cars. You had to 
20101227142221.936|20101227142223.682|TR0|walk through an entire, like, 
20101227142223.682|20101227142225.428|TR0|foot of snow down the block. And 
20101227142225.428|20101227142227.175|TR0|once I finally made it to 
20101227142227.175|20101227142228.921|TR0|Seventh Avenue, it was clear. 
20101227142228.921|20101227142230.667|TR0|But it's a blizzard outside. 
20101227142230.667|20101227142232.413|TR0|It's unbelievable.
20101227142232.413|20101227142234.160|TR0|
20101227142234.160|20101227142235.906|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, thanks for 
20101227142235.906|20101227142237.652|TR0|that breaking news. It's a 
20101227142237.652|20101227142239.399|TR0|blizzard outside, folks. And 
20101227142239.399|20101227142241.145|TR0|then there is Nick Gilla, who 
20101227142241.145|20101227142242.891|TR0|came from Crown Heights, as 
20101227142242.891|20101227142244.637|TR0|well. Nick, how did you make it?
20101227142244.637|20101227142246.384|TR0|
20101227142246.384|20101227142248.130|TR0|NICK GILLA I had to trudge 
20101227142248.130|20101227142249.876|TR0|through waist-high snow and wait 
20101227142249.876|20101227142251.623|TR0|for the train for probably 25 
20101227142251.623|20101227142253.369|TR0|minutes.
20101227142253.369|20101227142255.115|TR0|
20101227142255.115|20101227142256.861|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Well, thank you 
20101227142256.861|20101227142258.608|TR0|for getting here.
20101227142258.608|20101227142300.354|TR0|
20101227142300.354|20101227142302.100|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: There you have 
20101227142302.100|20101227142303.847|TR0|it, the very trusty crew that 
20101227142303.847|20101227142305.593|TR0|rolls out Democracy Now! every 
20101227142305.593|20101227142307.339|TR0|day. And special thanks also to

20101227142309.085|20101227142310.832|TR0|who made it after that little 
20101227142310.832|20101227142312.578|TR0|documentary. Yes, we are in a 
20101227142312.578|20101227142314.324|TR0|massive blizzard along the East 
20101227142314.324|20101227142316.071|TR0|Coast. We'll talk about global 
20101227142316.071|20101227142317.817|TR0|warming later. This is Democracy 
20101227142317.817|20101227142319.563|TR0|Now!, democracynow.org, The War 
20101227142319.563|20101227142321.309|TR0|and Peace Report. Be careful. 
20101227142321.309|20101227142323.056|TR0|Don't go to work if you don't 
20101227142323.056|20101227142324.802|TR0|have to. Stay - certainly, try 
20101227142324.802|20101227142326.548|TR0|not to drive on these streets. 
20101227142326.548|20101227142328.294|TR0|Everywhere we went, as Rah said, 
20101227142328.294|20101227142330.041|TR0|the plows were plowed in. People 
20101227142330.041|20101227142331.787|TR0|are skidding along the streets. 
20101227142331.787|20101227142333.533|TR0|It's not safe. Not to mention, 
20101227142333.533|20101227142335.280|TR0|if you're talking global

20101227142439.892|20101227142441.638|TR0|Gbagbo by urging him to make a 
20101227142441.638|20101227142443.385|TR0|peaceful exit. In this regard, 
20101227142443.385|20101227142445.131|TR0|the authority decided to 
20101227142445.131|20101227142446.877|TR0|dispatch a special high-level 
20101227142446.877|20101227142448.624|TR0|delegation to Cote d'Ivoire. In

20101227142507.833|20101227142509.579|TR0|been accused of orchestrating 
20101227142509.579|20101227142511.325|TR0|some 200 deaths, hundreds of 
20101227142511.325|20101227142513.071|TR0|arrests, dozens of cases of 
20101227142513.071|20101227142514.818|TR0|disappearances and torture in 
20101227142514.818|20101227142516.564|TR0|recent weeks. Some 14,000 people 
20101227142516.564|20101227142518.310|TR0|have already fled to 
20101227142518.310|20101227142520.057|TR0|neighbouring Liberia, and the 
20101227142520.057|20101227142521.803|TR0|U.N. says it's prepared for a 
20101227142521.803|20101227142523.549|TR0|total of 30,000 refugees in the 
20101227142523.549|20101227142525.295|TR0|region. In Washington, State 
20101227142525.295|20101227142527.042|TR0|Department spokesperson P.J. 
20101227142527.042|20101227142528.788|TR0|Crowley said Gbagbo must step 
20101227142528.788|20101227142530.534|TR0|down.
20101227142530.534|20101227142532.281|TR0|
20101227142532.281|20101227142534.027|TR0|>> P.J. CROWLEY: The certified 
20101227142534.027|20101227142535.773|TR0|results irrefutably show that 
20101227142535.773|20101227142537.519|TR0|President-elect Ouattara was the 
20101227142537.519|20101227142539.266|TR0|winner. Credible, accredited and 
20101227142539.266|20101227142541.012|TR0|independent election observers 
20101227142541.012|20101227142542.758|TR0|have declared the election to be 
20101227142542.758|20101227142544.505|TR0|fair and reported no instances 
20101227142544.505|20101227142546.251|TR0|of fraud that would change the 
20101227142546.251|20101227142547.997|TR0|outcome as announced by the 
20101227142547.997|20101227142549.743|TR0|electoral commission. And so, 
20101227142549.743|20101227142551.490|TR0|Mr. President Gbagbo must accept 
20101227142551.490|20101227142553.236|TR0|the results of the election. 
20101227142553.236|20101227142554.982|TR0|From our standpoint, this is not 
20101227142554.982|20101227142556.729|TR0|negotiable.
20101227142556.729|20101227142558.475|TR0|
20101227142558.475|20101227142600.221|TR0|President Gbagbo also claimed 
20101227142600.221|20101227142601.967|TR0|that the current situation in 
20101227142601.967|20101227142603.714|TR0|Cote d'Ivoire has been peaceful. 
20101227142603.714|20101227142605.460|TR0|This is untrue. The 
20101227142605.460|20101227142607.206|TR0|international community is 
20101227142607.206|20101227142608.953|TR0|documenting widespread human 
20101227142608.953|20101227142610.699|TR0|rights abuses occurring in the 
20101227142610.699|20101227142612.445|TR0|country, from home abductions to 
20101227142612.445|20101227142614.191|TR0|a feared mass grave in Abidjan.

20101227142621.177|20101227142622.923|TR0|global blackout last week, and 
20101227142622.923|20101227142624.669|TR0|we hope that we're able to 
20101227142624.669|20101227142626.415|TR0|maintain this connection. Horace 
20101227142626.415|20101227142628.162|TR0|Campbell is professor of

20101227142635.147|20101227142636.893|TR0|also in a state of emergency 
20101227142636.893|20101227142638.639|TR0|right now because of the 
20101227142638.639|20101227142640.386|TR0|blizzard. Just before we talk 
20101227142640.386|20101227142642.132|TR0|about Ivory Coast, what is it 
20101227142642.132|20101227142643.878|TR0|like in North Carolina, in 
20101227142643.878|20101227142645.624|TR0|Raleigh, Professor Campbell?
20101227142645.624|20101227142647.371|TR0|
20101227142647.371|20101227142649.117|TR0|>> HORACE CAMPBELL: I'm actually 
20101227142649.117|20101227142650.863|TR0|in Winston-Salem, and I'm 
20101227142650.863|20101227142652.610|TR0|actually surprised, because we 
20101227142652.610|20101227142654.356|TR0|have less than three inches of 
20101227142654.356|20101227142656.102|TR0|snow here in Winston-Salem, 
20101227142656.102|20101227142657.848|TR0|North Carolina. I'm from 
20101227142657.848|20101227142659.595|TR0|Syracuse, and in the last two 
20101227142659.595|20101227142701.341|TR0|weeks, we had 71 inches of snow 
20101227142701.341|20101227142703.087|TR0|in Syracuse. But we are a bit 
20101227142703.087|20101227142704.834|TR0|hard in Syracuse. We have a long 
20101227142704.834|20101227142706.580|TR0|history of resistance and hard 
20101227142706.580|20101227142708.326|TR0|work. Peace Council is 75 years 
20101227142708.326|20101227142710.072|TR0|in Syracuse, 75 years old. So 
20101227142710.072|20101227142711.819|TR0|I'm actually very surprised to 
20101227142711.819|20101227142713.565|TR0|see that, on the ground here - 
20101227142713.565|20101227142715.311|TR0|I'm looking outside the window - 
20101227142715.311|20101227142717.058|TR0|there are less than three inches 
20101227142717.058|20101227142718.804|TR0|of snow, and I hear that there's 
20101227142718.804|20101227142720.550|TR0|a state of emergency because of 
20101227142720.550|20101227142722.296|TR0|three inches of snow. Coming 
20101227142722.296|20101227142724.043|TR0|from Syracuse, that is amazing 
20101227142724.043|20101227142725.789|TR0|to me.

20101227142729.282|20101227142731.028|TR0|always amazed me, even in 
20101227142731.028|20101227142732.774|TR0|Washington, D.C., that it seems 
20101227142732.774|20101227142734.520|TR0|like when there's a snowflake, 
20101227142734.520|20101227142736.267|TR0|the entire Capitol shuts down. 
20101227142736.267|20101227142738.013|TR0|But speaking of adversity, let's 
20101227142738.013|20101227142739.759|TR0|turn right now to the Ivory 
20101227142739.759|20101227142741.506|TR0|Coast, which certainly is in the 
20101227142741.506|20101227142743.252|TR0|midst of a firestorm. Explain 
20101227142743.252|20101227142744.998|TR0|what is happening there. Talk 
20101227142744.998|20101227142746.744|TR0|about the elections and what 
20101227142746.744|20101227142748.491|TR0|took place, Professor Campbell.

20101227142750.237|20101227142751.983|TR0|>> HORACE CAMPBELL: Well, this 
20101227142751.983|20101227142753.730|TR0|is a test for the African Union. 
20101227142753.730|20101227142755.476|TR0|It's a test for whether the 
20101227142755.476|20101227142757.222|TR0|concept of people's rights and 
20101227142757.222|20101227142758.968|TR0|the idea of democracy will go 
20101227142758.968|20101227142800.715|TR0|beyond elections, because in the 
20101227142800.715|20101227142802.461|TR0|case of the Ivory Coast, that is 
20101227142802.461|20101227142804.207|TR0|called Cote d'Ivoire, we have a 
20101227142804.207|20101227142805.953|TR0|situation where the person who 
20101227142805.953|20101227142807.700|TR0|has lost the election, Laurent 
20101227142807.700|20101227142809.446|TR0|Gbagbo, is refusing to step 
20101227142809.446|20101227142811.192|TR0|down. And in the process of 
20101227142811.192|20101227142812.939|TR0|refusing to step down, he and 
20101227142812.939|20101227142814.685|TR0|those around him, they are 
20101227142814.685|20101227142816.431|TR0|invoking all forms of xenophobia 
20101227142816.431|20101227142818.177|TR0|and hostility to people from the 
20101227142818.177|20101227142819.924|TR0|north in order to divide the 
20101227142819.924|20101227142821.670|TR0|country. Thankfully, the days 
20101227142821.670|20101227142823.416|TR0|when Liberia, Sierra Leone and 
20101227142823.416|20101227142825.163|TR0|Guinea were places that could 
20101227142825.163|20101227142826.909|TR0|provide the mercenaries so that 
20101227142826.909|20101227142828.655|TR0|Gbagbo could develop war, 
20101227142828.655|20101227142830.401|TR0|thankfully, we are in the state 
20101227142830.401|20101227142832.148|TR0|of transition in Sierra Leone, 
20101227142832.148|20101227142833.894|TR0|in Liberia and Guinea so that 
20101227142833.894|20101227142835.640|TR0|the possibility for war will be 
20101227142835.640|20101227142837.387|TR0|dependent on the extent to which 
20101227142837.387|20101227142839.133|TR0|Gbagbo can get support from 
20101227142839.133|20101227142840.879|TR0|persons like Lanny Davis in the 
20101227142840.879|20101227142842.625|TR0|United States and the bankers 
20101227142842.625|20101227142844.372|TR0|and financial elements within 
20101227142844.372|20101227142846.118|TR0|the country that will finance 
20101227142846.118|20101227142847.864|TR0|his army.
20101227142847.864|20101227142849.611|TR0|
20101227142849.611|20101227142851.357|TR0|The position of the African 
20101227142851.357|20101227142853.103|TR0|Union, the position of ECOWAS, 
20101227142853.103|20101227142854.849|TR0|the position of the United 
20101227142854.849|20101227142856.596|TR0|Nations is clear, that the 
20101227142856.596|20101227142858.342|TR0|elections were won by Alassane 
20101227142858.342|20101227142900.088|TR0|Ouattara and that Gbagbo should 
20101227142900.088|20101227142901.835|TR0|step down. Gbagbo is doing what 
20101227142901.835|20101227142903.581|TR0|Mugabe has done in Zimbabwe and 
20101227142903.581|20101227142905.327|TR0|that Kibaki did in Kenya. When 
20101227142905.327|20101227142907.073|TR0|you lose an election, they use 
20101227142907.073|20101227142908.820|TR0|the powers of the state to say 
20101227142908.820|20101227142910.566|TR0|the elections are rigged, and 
20101227142910.566|20101227142912.312|TR0|then you maintain power by 
20101227142912.312|20101227142914.059|TR0|force. The African Union is 
20101227142914.059|20101227142915.805|TR0|taking a very strong position in 
20101227142915.805|20101227142917.551|TR0|the case of Ivory Coast, and 
20101227142917.551|20101227142919.297|TR0|what we're dreading is the 
20101227142919.297|20101227142921.044|TR0|actual military confrontation, 
20101227142921.044|20101227142922.790|TR0|which has been promised by 
20101227142922.790|20101227142924.536|TR0|ECOWAS. As you played in the 
20101227142924.536|20101227142926.283|TR0|clip, it said that they will use 
20101227142926.283|20101227142928.029|TR0|credible force. We are hoping 
20101227142928.029|20101227142929.775|TR0|that sanctions and the rising by 
20101227142929.775|20101227142931.521|TR0|the working peoples will be 
20101227142931.521|20101227142933.268|TR0|enough to bring down Gbagbo.

20101227142941.999|20101227142943.745|TR0|Lanny Davis, who has been 
20101227142943.745|20101227142945.492|TR0|employed by Gbagbo to lobby for 
20101227142945.492|20101227142947.238|TR0|him in Washington to present the 
20101227142947.238|20101227142948.984|TR0|government as a transparent and

20101227142957.716|20101227142959.462|TR0|to the ouster of the 
20101227142959.462|20101227143001.208|TR0|democratically elected leader of 
20101227143001.208|20101227143002.954|TR0|Honduras. He was a spokesperson 
20101227143002.954|20101227143004.701|TR0|for those who supported the coup 
20101227143004.701|20101227143006.447|TR0|in Honduras. Explain exactly 
20101227143006.447|20101227143008.193|TR0|what his role is in the Ivory 
20101227143008.193|20101227143009.940|TR0|Coast and who he is, his 
20101227143009.940|20101227143011.686|TR0|significance in U.S. democratic

20101227143016.925|20101227143018.671|TR0|not in U.S. democratic politics. 
20101227143018.671|20101227143020.417|TR0|It's the Clinton faction of the 
20101227143020.417|20101227143022.164|TR0|Democratic Party politics. And 
20101227143022.164|20101227143023.910|TR0|he has been an adviser to Bill 
20101227143023.910|20101227143025.656|TR0|Clinton, and he remains close to 
20101227143025.656|20101227143027.402|TR0|the Clintons. Lanny Davis has a 
20101227143027.402|20101227143029.149|TR0|lobbying firm. Right now he's 
20101227143029.149|20101227143030.895|TR0|employed by one of the worst 
20101227143030.895|20101227143032.641|TR0|dictators in Africa, the Nguema 
20101227143032.641|20101227143034.388|TR0|clique, that has ruled 
20101227143034.388|20101227143036.134|TR0|Equatorial Guinea for 30 years. 
20101227143036.134|20101227143037.880|TR0|This is a government that has 
20101227143037.880|20101227143039.626|TR0|vast wealth from oil companies, 
20101227143039.626|20101227143041.373|TR0|whose children own mansions in

20101227143044.865|20101227143046.612|TR0|that should be used for water

20101227143051.850|20101227143053.597|TR0|Guinea, employed Lanny Davis, 
20101227143053.597|20101227143055.343|TR0|who's a lobbyist in Washington, 
20101227143055.343|20101227143057.089|TR0|to present an image of these 
20101227143057.089|20101227143058.835|TR0|dictators in Equatorial Guinea 
20101227143058.835|20101227143100.582|TR0|that could be sold to the 
20101227143100.582|20101227143102.328|TR0|corporate elements in the United

20101227143105.821|20101227143107.567|TR0|As you rightly pointed out, when 
20101227143107.567|20101227143109.313|TR0|the coup took place in Honduras, 
20101227143109.313|20101227143111.059|TR0|Lanny Davis also represented the 
20101227143111.059|20101227143112.806|TR0|militarist elements there. It is 
20101227143112.806|20101227143114.552|TR0|this track record that has 
20101227143114.552|20101227143116.298|TR0|endeared him to the Gbagbo 
20101227143116.298|20101227143118.045|TR0|forces, the Gbagbo forces whose 
20101227143118.045|20101227143119.791|TR0|elements of millions of dollars 
20101227143119.791|20101227143121.537|TR0|have also used the money that 
20101227143121.537|20101227143123.283|TR0|should be used for the people of 
20101227143123.283|20101227143125.030|TR0|Ivory Coast to employ Lanny 
20101227143125.030|20101227143126.776|TR0|Davis. And what we should see is 
20101227143126.776|20101227143128.522|TR0|Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton 
20101227143128.522|20101227143130.269|TR0|should distance themselves from 
20101227143130.269|20101227143132.015|TR0|such a person, because the 
20101227143132.015|20101227143133.761|TR0|United States cannot in one 
20101227143133.761|20101227143135.507|TR0|breath say that they're 
20101227143135.507|20101227143137.254|TR0|supporting transparency and 
20101227143137.254|20101227143139.000|TR0|accountability - that's the 
20101227143139.000|20101227143140.746|TR0|words that have been used by 
20101227143140.746|20101227143142.493|TR0|Lanny Davis - in Africa, while 
20101227143142.493|20101227143144.239|TR0|they are allied with persons 
20101227143144.239|20101227143145.985|TR0|such as this who support

20101227143154.717|20101227143156.463|TR0|and African American studies at 
20101227143156.463|20101227143158.209|TR0|Syracuse University. It's very 
20101227143158.209|20101227143159.955|TR0|interesting what you're saying, 
20101227143159.955|20101227143201.702|TR0|because when he represented 
20101227143201.702|20101227143203.448|TR0|those who supported the coup in 
20101227143203.448|20101227143205.194|TR0|Honduras, when we saw the 
20101227143205.194|20101227143206.941|TR0|documents released by WikiLeaks, 
20101227143206.941|20101227143208.687|TR0|the U.S. diplomatic cables, in 
20101227143208.687|20101227143210.433|TR0|fact, their analysis of what 
20101227143210.433|20101227143212.179|TR0|happened in Honduras was dead 
20101227143212.179|20101227143213.926|TR0|on: this is an illegal coup that 
20101227143213.926|20101227143215.672|TR0|has taken place in Honduras. But 
20101227143215.672|20101227143217.418|TR0|it's not what Secretary of State 
20101227143217.418|20101227143219.165|TR0|Hillary Clinton nor the 
20101227143219.165|20101227143220.911|TR0|President was saying on a 
20101227143220.911|20101227143222.657|TR0|regular basis, Professor 
20101227143222.657|20101227143224.403|TR0|Campbell. Do you see something 
20101227143224.403|20101227143226.150|TR0|similar happening right now in 
20101227143226.150|20101227143227.896|TR0|Africa's Ivory Coast?
20101227143227.896|20101227143229.642|TR0|
20101227143229.642|20101227143231.388|TR0|>> HORACE CAMPBELL: Very, very 
20101227143231.388|20101227143233.135|TR0|similar. In this case, Gbagbo is 
20101227143233.135|20101227143234.881|TR0|trying to exploit differences 
20101227143234.881|20101227143236.627|TR0|between the State Department and 
20101227143236.627|20101227143238.374|TR0|the White House. The President 
20101227143238.374|20101227143240.120|TR0|of the United States called 
20101227143240.120|20101227143241.866|TR0|Laurent Gbagbo to urge him to 
20101227143241.866|20101227143243.612|TR0|step down, and he was so 
20101227143243.612|20101227143245.359|TR0|arrogant that he refused to take 
20101227143245.359|20101227143247.105|TR0|the telephone call of President 
20101227143247.105|20101227143248.851|TR0|Barack Obama. And he is arrogant 
20101227143248.851|20101227143250.598|TR0|enough to believe that he can 
20101227143250.598|20101227143252.344|TR0|whip up the kind of xenophobia 
20101227143252.344|20101227143254.090|TR0|to divide the people of the 
20101227143254.090|20101227143255.836|TR0|Ivory Coast to say that Alassane 
20101227143255.836|20101227143257.583|TR0|Ouattara is not an Ivorian, that 
20101227143257.583|20101227143259.329|TR0|Alassane Ouattara is from the 
20101227143259.329|20101227143301.075|TR0|north, he's a Muslim, and he is 
20101227143301.075|20101227143302.822|TR0|using all kinds of divisiveness 
20101227143302.822|20101227143304.568|TR0|that we have seen in that 
20101227143304.568|20101227143306.314|TR0|country, so that the people of 
20101227143306.314|20101227143308.060|TR0|the north, the people who are of 
20101227143308.060|20101227143309.807|TR0|Islamic background, are being 
20101227143309.807|20101227143311.553|TR0|presented as non-Ivorians. I 
20101227143311.553|20101227143313.299|TR0|have no - I have no beef for 
20101227143313.299|20101227143315.046|TR0|Alassane Ouattara, but the point 
20101227143315.046|20101227143316.792|TR0|is, the people voted for him, 
20101227143316.792|20101227143318.538|TR0|and the election's results 
20101227143318.538|20101227143320.284|TR0|should be observed.
20101227143320.284|20101227143322.031|TR0|
20101227143322.031|20101227143323.777|TR0|And the positive result out of 
20101227143323.777|20101227143325.523|TR0|all of this is the clarity of 
20101227143325.523|20101227143327.270|TR0|the African Union, the fact that 
20101227143327.270|20101227143329.016|TR0|the African Union is taking a 
20101227143329.016|20101227143330.762|TR0|very clear position that 
20101227143330.762|20101227143332.508|TR0|Ouattara won the election. The 
20101227143332.508|20101227143334.255|TR0|African Union is taking a very 
20101227143334.255|20101227143336.001|TR0|clear position that they will 
20101227143336.001|20101227143337.747|TR0|use force. And the fact that the 
20101227143337.747|20101227143339.494|TR0|meeting of ECOWAS that took 
20101227143339.494|20101227143341.240|TR0|place two days ago would send a 
20101227143341.240|20101227143342.986|TR0|very clear signal so that there 
20101227143342.986|20101227143344.732|TR0|could be no manipulation within 
20101227143344.732|20101227143346.479|TR0|West Africa itself, I think this 
20101227143346.479|20101227143348.225|TR0|is part of the maturity of the 
20101227143348.225|20101227143349.971|TR0|African Union process. And we're 
20101227143349.971|20101227143351.718|TR0|going to need that process also 
20101227143351.718|20101227143353.464|TR0|in the Sudan in nine to 11 days' 
20101227143353.464|20101227143355.210|TR0|time, when we face a similar 
20101227143355.210|20101227143356.956|TR0|crisis in the Sudan. So, what we 
20101227143356.956|20101227143358.703|TR0|in this side of the world have 
20101227143358.703|20101227143400.449|TR0|to do, we have to keep up our 
20101227143400.449|20101227143402.195|TR0|education to the citizens so 
20101227143402.195|20101227143403.941|TR0|that people like Lanny Davis and 
20101227143403.941|20101227143405.688|TR0|the State Department and the 
20101227143405.688|20101227143407.434|TR0|U.S. Africa Command cannot use 
20101227143407.434|20101227143409.180|TR0|incidents such as what is 
20101227143409.180|20101227143410.927|TR0|happening in the Ivory Coast to 
20101227143410.927|20101227143412.673|TR0|represent Africa as backward and 
20101227143412.673|20101227143414.419|TR0|divisive and barbarian.
20101227143414.419|20101227143416.165|TR0|
20101227143416.165|20101227143417.912|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Professor 
20101227143417.912|20101227143419.658|TR0|Campbell, if you could look 
20101227143419.658|20101227143421.404|TR0|directly into the camera as you 
20101227143421.404|20101227143423.151|TR0|speak, but give us a thumbnail 
20101227143423.151|20101227143424.897|TR0|history of the Ivory Coast, a 
20101227143424.897|20101227143426.643|TR0|geopolitical history, how it got 
20101227143426.643|20101227143428.389|TR0|to this point. I think most 
20101227143428.389|20101227143430.136|TR0|people in the United States, or 
20101227143430.136|20101227143431.882|TR0|people who are listening and 
20101227143431.882|20101227143433.628|TR0|watching now all over the world, 
20101227143433.628|20101227143435.375|TR0|probably have very little idea 
20101227143435.375|20101227143437.121|TR0|about even where the Ivory 
20101227143437.121|20101227143438.867|TR0|Coast, where Cote d'Ivoire is.
20101227143438.867|20101227143440.613|TR0|
20101227143440.613|20101227143442.360|TR0|>> HORACE CAMPBELL: OK. Well, 
20101227143442.360|20101227143444.106|TR0|the Ivory Coast was a jewel in 
20101227143444.106|20101227143445.852|TR0|the crown of French colonialism. 
20101227143445.852|20101227143447.599|TR0|The Ivory Coast, by its very 
20101227143447.599|20101227143449.345|TR0|name, was a place where colonial 
20101227143449.345|20101227143451.091|TR0|plunder took ivory and gold. And 
20101227143451.091|20101227143452.837|TR0|the Ivory Coast is located in 
20101227143452.837|20101227143454.584|TR0|West Africa, bordered by 
20101227143454.584|20101227143456.330|TR0|Liberia, bordered by Sierra 
20101227143456.330|20101227143458.076|TR0|Leone, and by Ghana. Now, the 
20101227143458.076|20101227143459.823|TR0|president of the Ivory Coast, 
20101227143459.823|20101227143501.569|TR0|when Ivory Coast became 
20101227143501.569|20101227143503.315|TR0|independent in 1960, the 
20101227143503.315|20101227143505.061|TR0|president of Ivory Coast was 
20101227143505.061|20101227143506.808|TR0|Houphouet-Boigny. 
20101227143506.808|20101227143508.554|TR0|Houphouet-Boigny used the Ivory 
20101227143508.554|20101227143510.300|TR0|Coast as a base for 
20101227143510.300|20101227143512.047|TR0|counterrevolution in Africa. All 
20101227143512.047|20101227143513.793|TR0|of the forces of French 
20101227143513.793|20101227143515.539|TR0|colonialism, all of the forces 
20101227143515.539|20101227143517.285|TR0|of French exploitation, all of 
20101227143517.285|20101227143519.032|TR0|the forces of French militarism 
20101227143519.032|20101227143520.778|TR0|converged on the Ivory Coast. 
20101227143520.778|20101227143522.524|TR0|And for 30 or more years, the 
20101227143522.524|20101227143524.271|TR0|Ivory Coast was the base for 
20101227143524.271|20101227143526.017|TR0|supporting apartheid in South 
20101227143526.017|20101227143527.763|TR0|Africa. It was a base for 
20101227143527.763|20101227143529.509|TR0|supporting Jonas Savimbi. Jonas 
20101227143529.509|20101227143531.256|TR0|Savimbi was very close to the 
20101227143531.256|20101227143533.002|TR0|leader, Houphouet-Boigny. And 
20101227143533.002|20101227143534.748|TR0|some of your listeners would 
20101227143534.748|20101227143536.494|TR0|know that they were also 
20101227143536.494|20101227143538.241|TR0|complicit in the plot to 
20101227143538.241|20101227143539.987|TR0|assassinate Thomas Sankara in 
20101227143539.987|20101227143541.733|TR0|Burkina Faso.
20101227143541.733|20101227143543.480|TR0|
20101227143543.480|20101227143545.226|TR0|Now, the fact is, because of the 
20101227143545.226|20101227143546.972|TR0|intensification of the 
20101227143546.972|20101227143548.718|TR0|investment in the Ivory Coast in 
20101227143548.718|20101227143550.465|TR0|that period, in the 50-year 
20101227143550.465|20101227143552.211|TR0|period, millions of Africans 
20101227143552.211|20101227143553.957|TR0|went to work on banana and cocoa 
20101227143553.957|20101227143555.704|TR0|plantations, so that there were 
20101227143555.704|20101227143557.450|TR0|a number of people, persons from 
20101227143557.450|20101227143559.196|TR0|Burkina Faso, persons from 
20101227143559.196|20101227143600.942|TR0|Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone and 
20101227143600.942|20101227143602.689|TR0|Ghana, who worked in that 
20101227143602.689|20101227143604.435|TR0|country. So the country has 20 
20101227143604.435|20101227143606.181|TR0|million persons. There are 10 or 
20101227143606.181|20101227143607.928|TR0|a million more persons from 
20101227143607.928|20101227143609.674|TR0|north of the country whose 
20101227143609.674|20101227143611.420|TR0|ancestors came as migrant 
20101227143611.420|20101227143613.166|TR0|workers. Now, in the spirit of 
20101227143613.166|20101227143614.913|TR0|pan-Africanism, one should 
20101227143614.913|20101227143616.659|TR0|recognize that the borders in 
20101227143616.659|20101227143618.405|TR0|the Ivory Coast were 
20101227143618.405|20101227143620.152|TR0|artificially created at the 
20101227143620.152|20101227143621.898|TR0|Conference of Berlin.
20101227143621.898|20101227143623.644|TR0|
20101227143623.644|20101227143625.390|TR0|Well, in 1993, after 
20101227143625.390|20101227143627.137|TR0|Houphouet-Boigny passed away, 
20101227143627.137|20101227143628.883|TR0|Alassane Ouattara was the prime 
20101227143628.883|20101227143630.629|TR0|minister. They wrote a Supreme 
20101227143630.629|20101227143632.376|TR0|Court judgment to say that those 
20101227143632.376|20101227143634.122|TR0|who are from the north were not 
20101227143634.122|20101227143635.868|TR0|Ivorian citizens, and Alassane 
20101227143635.868|20101227143637.614|TR0|Ouattara, whose mother 
20101227143637.614|20101227143639.361|TR0|supposedly was born in the 
20101227143639.361|20101227143641.107|TR0|Burkina Faso, could not become a 
20101227143641.107|20101227143642.853|TR0|candidate for the presidency. 
20101227143642.853|20101227143644.600|TR0|Now, between 1999 and 2000, 
20101227143644.600|20101227143646.346|TR0|Gbagbo himself ran in an 
20101227143646.346|20101227143648.092|TR0|elections, and when he won the 
20101227143648.092|20101227143649.838|TR0|elections, the general who was 
20101227143649.838|20101227143651.585|TR0|the head of the army said that 
20101227143651.585|20101227143653.331|TR0|Gbagbo could not come to power. 
20101227143653.331|20101227143655.077|TR0|Gbagbo himself organized so that 
20101227143655.077|20101227143656.824|TR0|he could come to power, and 
20101227143656.824|20101227143658.570|TR0|there was a civil war in the 
20101227143658.570|20101227143700.316|TR0|country between 2000 and 2004, 
20101227143700.316|20101227143702.062|TR0|which, again, brought about the 
20101227143702.062|20101227143703.809|TR0|intervention of South Africa and 
20101227143703.809|20101227143705.555|TR0|the African Union. In that 
20101227143705.555|20101227143707.301|TR0|invention, the African Union 
20101227143707.301|20101227143709.047|TR0|worked to overturn that judgment 
20101227143709.047|20101227143710.794|TR0|of the Supreme Court that said 
20101227143710.794|20101227143712.540|TR0|that persons from the north 
20101227143712.540|20101227143714.286|TR0|could not be citizens.
20101227143714.286|20101227143716.033|TR0|
20101227143716.033|20101227143717.779|TR0|And this idea is a sentiment 
20101227143717.779|20101227143719.525|TR0|that is whipped up in the 
20101227143719.525|20101227143721.271|TR0|country called Ivority. Ivority 
20101227143721.271|20101227143723.018|TR0|is a chauvinistic notion. It is 
20101227143723.018|20101227143724.764|TR0|an anti-pan-African notion. It's 
20101227143724.764|20101227143726.510|TR0|a notion that says only those 
20101227143726.510|20101227143728.257|TR0|who are Christian from the 
20101227143728.257|20101227143730.003|TR0|southern area of the country can 
20101227143730.003|20101227143731.749|TR0|be citizens. Now, this is not 
20101227143731.749|20101227143733.495|TR0|something that is carried by the 
20101227143733.495|20101227143735.242|TR0|majority of the citizens of the 
20101227143735.242|20101227143736.988|TR0|Ivory Coast; this is an idea 
20101227143736.988|20101227143738.734|TR0|that is whipped up by the 
20101227143738.734|20101227143740.481|TR0|elements of the Ivorian 
20101227143740.481|20101227143742.227|TR0|capitalist class. These are 
20101227143742.227|20101227143743.973|TR0|Ivorians who have made millions 
20101227143743.973|20101227143745.719|TR0|of dollars out of cocoa 
20101227143745.719|20101227143747.466|TR0|plantation, out of exploiting

20101227143813.660|20101227143815.406|TR0|fleeing the Ivory Coast, as the

20101227143904.302|20101227143906.048|TR0|to the private sector. That's 
20101227143906.048|20101227143907.795|TR0|the title of a new investigation 
20101227143907.795|20101227143909.541|TR0|by the Boston Globe that exposes 
20101227143909.541|20101227143911.287|TR0|how retiring generals are 
20101227143911.287|20101227143913.034|TR0|leaving the military in large 
20101227143913.034|20101227143914.780|TR0|numbers to take lucrative jobs 
20101227143914.780|20101227143916.526|TR0|in the defense industry with 
20101227143916.526|20101227143918.272|TR0|little concern for any conflicts

20101227143921.765|20101227143923.511|TR0|The Globe analyzed the career 
20101227143923.511|20101227143925.258|TR0|paths of 750 of the 
20101227143925.258|20101227143927.004|TR0|highest-ranking generals and 
20101227143927.004|20101227143928.750|TR0|admirals who retired during the 
20101227143928.750|20101227143930.496|TR0|last two decades. The results 
20101227143930.496|20101227143932.243|TR0|are staggering. From 2004 
20101227143932.243|20101227143933.989|TR0|through 2008, 80 percent of 
20101227143933.989|20101227143935.735|TR0|retiring three- and four-star 
20101227143935.735|20101227143937.482|TR0|officers went to work as 
20101227143937.482|20101227143939.228|TR0|consultants or defense 
20101227143939.228|20101227143940.974|TR0|executives. That compares with 
20101227143940.974|20101227143942.720|TR0|less than half who followed that 
20101227143942.720|20101227143944.467|TR0|path a decade earlier.

20101227143949.706|20101227143951.452|TR0|recruited for private-sector 
20101227143951.452|20101227143953.198|TR0|roles well before they retire, 
20101227143953.198|20101227143954.944|TR0|raising questions about their 
20101227143954.944|20101227143956.691|TR0|independence and judgment while 
20101227143956.691|20101227143958.437|TR0|still in uniform. What's more, 
20101227143958.437|20101227144000.183|TR0|the Pentagon is aware and even 
20101227144000.183|20101227144001.930|TR0|supports this practice.

20101227144015.900|20101227144017.646|TR0|day. The East Coast is 
20101227144017.646|20101227144019.392|TR0|blanketed. Talk about this 
20101227144019.392|20101227144021.139|TR0|research you have done, which is 
20101227144021.139|20101227144022.885|TR0|really a stunning expose.

20101227144024.631|20101227144026.377|TR0|>> BRYAN BENDER: Well, what we 
20101227144026.377|20101227144028.124|TR0|did is, as you mentioned, went 
20101227144028.124|20101227144029.870|TR0|back and looked at the most 
20101227144029.870|20101227144031.616|TR0|senior military officers who 
20101227144031.616|20101227144033.363|TR0|have retired in the last 20 
20101227144033.363|20101227144035.109|TR0|years to see where they went and 
20101227144035.109|20101227144036.855|TR0|what they did in their 
20101227144036.855|20101227144038.601|TR0|post-military careers. And the 
20101227144038.601|20101227144040.348|TR0|growth in the share of the 
20101227144040.348|20101227144042.094|TR0|three- and four-star generals 
20101227144042.094|20101227144043.840|TR0|and admirals who have gone into 
20101227144043.840|20101227144045.587|TR0|private defense work has 
20101227144045.587|20101227144047.333|TR0|increased quite substantially.
20101227144047.333|20101227144049.079|TR0|
20101227144049.079|20101227144050.825|TR0|But what we found was not just 
20101227144050.825|20101227144052.572|TR0|the numbers. I think some would 
20101227144052.572|20101227144054.318|TR0|suggest that the nation has been 
20101227144054.318|20101227144056.064|TR0|at war for nearly a decade, so 
20101227144056.064|20101227144057.811|TR0|that explains, at least 
20101227144057.811|20101227144059.557|TR0|partially, why the rise. But 
20101227144059.557|20101227144101.303|TR0|more interesting was the sort of 
20101227144101.303|20101227144103.049|TR0|blurred lines between the role 
20101227144103.049|20101227144104.796|TR0|of these senior officers in the 
20101227144104.796|20101227144106.542|TR0|defense industry and their 
20101227144106.542|20101227144108.288|TR0|continuing role as official or 
20101227144108.288|20101227144110.035|TR0|unofficial advisers to the

20101227144127.497|20101227144129.244|TR0|say, in other words, they're 
20101227144129.244|20101227144130.990|TR0|leaving the military and very 
20101227144130.990|20101227144132.736|TR0|quickly taking jobs at defense 
20101227144132.736|20101227144134.483|TR0|companies or, increasingly, as 
20101227144134.483|20101227144136.229|TR0|private consultants either in 
20101227144136.229|20101227144137.975|TR0|business for themselves or in 
20101227144137.975|20101227144139.721|TR0|these consulting firms that 
20101227144139.721|20101227144141.468|TR0|specialize in what people call 
20101227144141.468|20101227144143.214|TR0|the "rent a general" phenomenon. 
20101227144143.214|20101227144144.960|TR0|But while they're doing this 
20101227144144.960|20101227144146.706|TR0|private defense work, they're 
20101227144146.706|20101227144148.453|TR0|still shaping, in a very real 
20101227144148.453|20101227144150.199|TR0|way, what the Pentagon's 
20101227144150.199|20101227144151.945|TR0|priorities are, where they're 
20101227144151.945|20101227144153.692|TR0|investing money. And so, in any 
20101227144153.692|20101227144155.438|TR0|other world, that would seem a 
20101227144155.438|20101227144157.184|TR0|pretty clear conflict of 
20101227144157.184|20101227144158.930|TR0|interest.
20101227144158.930|20101227144200.677|TR0|
20101227144200.677|20101227144202.423|TR0|In one example, we found a 
20101227144202.423|20101227144204.169|TR0|retired four-star general from 
20101227144204.169|20101227144205.916|TR0|the Air Force who had been in 
20101227144205.916|20101227144207.662|TR0|charge of weapons programs, 
20101227144207.662|20101227144209.408|TR0|including the B-2 bomber, 
20101227144209.408|20101227144211.154|TR0|retires and then, within - 
20101227144211.154|20101227144212.901|TR0|literally within hours, is hired 
20101227144212.901|20101227144214.647|TR0|by Northrop Grumman, the 
20101227144214.647|20101227144216.393|TR0|manufacturer of the B-2, as a 
20101227144216.393|20101227144218.140|TR0|consultant, and then, very soon 
20101227144218.140|20101227144219.886|TR0|after, is called back by the Air 
20101227144219.886|20101227144221.632|TR0|Force to help oversee a study of 
20101227144221.632|20101227144223.378|TR0|what's going to replace the B-2 
20101227144223.378|20101227144225.125|TR0|bomber. So, that's just one 
20101227144225.125|20101227144226.871|TR0|example of, again, these blurred 
20101227144226.871|20101227144228.617|TR0|lines between a private defense 
20101227144228.617|20101227144230.364|TR0|company official or consultant 
20101227144230.364|20101227144232.110|TR0|and an adviser to the Pentagon.
20101227144232.110|20101227144233.856|TR0|
20101227144233.856|20101227144235.602|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You're talking 
20101227144235.602|20101227144237.349|TR0|about the man you started your 
20101227144237.349|20101227144239.095|TR0|piece "From the Pentagon to the 
20101227144239.095|20101227144240.841|TR0|Private Sector" with. "An hour 
20101227144240.841|20101227144242.588|TR0|after the official ceremony 
20101227144242.588|20101227144244.334|TR0|marking the end of his 35-year 
20101227144244.334|20101227144246.080|TR0|career in the Air Force, General 
20101227144246.080|20101227144247.826|TR0|Gregory 'Speedy' Martin returned 
20101227144247.826|20101227144249.573|TR0|to his quarters..." And you went 
20101227144249.573|20101227144251.319|TR0|from there saying, "almost as 
20101227144251.319|20101227144253.065|TR0|soon as he closed the door that 
20101227144253.065|20101227144254.812|TR0|day in 2005 his phone rang. It 
20101227144254.812|20101227144256.558|TR0|was an executive at Northrop 
20101227144256.558|20101227144258.304|TR0|Grumman."
20101227144258.304|20101227144300.050|TR0|
20101227144300.050|20101227144301.797|TR0|So, explain then - as you make 
20101227144301.797|20101227144303.543|TR0|your bullet points, you say, 
20101227144303.543|20101227144305.289|TR0|"When a 
20101227144305.289|20101227144307.036|TR0|general-turned-businessman 
20101227144307.036|20101227144308.782|TR0|arrives at the Pentagon, he is 
20101227144308.782|20101227144310.528|TR0|often treated with extraordinary 
20101227144310.528|20101227144312.274|TR0|deference - as if still in 
20101227144312.274|20101227144314.021|TR0|uniform - which can greatly 
20101227144314.021|20101227144315.767|TR0|increase his effectiveness as a 
20101227144315.767|20101227144317.513|TR0|rainmaker for industry. The 
20101227144317.513|20101227144319.259|TR0|military even has name for it - 
20101227144319.259|20101227144321.006|TR0|the 'bobblehead effect.'" 
20101227144321.006|20101227144322.752|TR0|Explain that.
20101227144322.752|20101227144324.498|TR0|
20101227144324.498|20101227144326.245|TR0|>> BRYAN BENDER: Well, that's 
20101227144326.245|20101227144327.991|TR0|one of the things that's most 
20101227144327.991|20101227144329.737|TR0|concerning to observers of this, 
20101227144329.737|20101227144331.483|TR0|including some retired generals 
20101227144331.483|20101227144333.230|TR0|and admirals themselves, who we 
20101227144333.230|20101227144334.976|TR0|interviewed. And that is that 
20101227144334.976|20101227144336.722|TR0|it's quite well known that 
20101227144336.722|20101227144338.469|TR0|there's a revolving door in 
20101227144338.469|20101227144340.215|TR0|Washington. If you leave 
20101227144340.215|20101227144341.961|TR0|Congress, if you leave an 
20101227144341.961|20101227144343.707|TR0|executive department, you go be 
20101227144343.707|20101227144345.454|TR0|a lobbyist or a consultant to 
20101227144345.454|20101227144347.200|TR0|the very industry that you had a 
20101227144347.200|20101227144348.946|TR0|responsibility to oversee while 
20101227144348.946|20101227144350.693|TR0|you were in the government.
20101227144350.693|20101227144352.439|TR0|
20101227144352.439|20101227144354.185|TR0|Where the military is different, 
20101227144354.185|20101227144355.931|TR0|people suggest, is this very 
20101227144355.931|20101227144357.678|TR0|rigid, ingrained system of 
20101227144357.678|20101227144359.424|TR0|hierarchy and deference to 
20101227144359.424|20101227144401.170|TR0|seniority. And the old adage, I 
20101227144401.170|20101227144402.917|TR0|think, applies: once a general, 
20101227144402.917|20101227144404.663|TR0|always a general. When you talk 
20101227144404.663|20101227144406.409|TR0|to some of the people who sit in 
20101227144406.409|20101227144408.155|TR0|some of these meetings of 
20101227144408.155|20101227144409.902|TR0|advisory panels and the sort of 
20101227144409.902|20101227144411.648|TR0|mind-numbing number of these 
20101227144411.648|20101227144413.394|TR0|commissions and other bodies 
20101227144413.394|20101227144415.141|TR0|that advise the military, if 
20101227144415.141|20101227144416.887|TR0|there's a retired four-star 
20101227144416.887|20101227144418.633|TR0|general in the room, he's going 
20101227144418.633|20101227144420.379|TR0|to get a level of respect. 
20101227144420.379|20101227144422.126|TR0|People are going to hear him out 
20101227144422.126|20101227144423.872|TR0|in a very real way, as if he's 
20101227144423.872|20101227144425.618|TR0|still a general and he didn't 
20101227144425.618|20101227144427.365|TR0|leave the military.
20101227144427.365|20101227144429.111|TR0|
20101227144429.111|20101227144430.857|TR0|And the bobblehead effect is a 
20101227144430.857|20101227144432.603|TR0|term that a few people used, 
20101227144432.603|20101227144434.350|TR0|which refers to those bobblehead 
20101227144434.350|20101227144436.096|TR0|toys where the head goes up and 
20101227144436.096|20101227144437.842|TR0|down. You get a retired general 
20101227144437.842|20101227144439.589|TR0|or admiral in many of these 
20101227144439.589|20101227144441.335|TR0|settings, and everybody sitting 
20101227144441.335|20101227144443.081|TR0|around the table, particularly 
20101227144443.081|20101227144444.827|TR0|military officers who may have 
20101227144444.827|20101227144446.574|TR0|worked for that general when he 
20101227144446.574|20101227144448.320|TR0|was in uniform - he or she was 
20101227144448.320|20101227144450.066|TR0|in uniform - or, you know, 
20101227144450.066|20101227144451.812|TR0|certainly knew of him, knew the 
20101227144451.812|20101227144453.559|TR0|command that he or she had had, 
20101227144453.559|20101227144455.305|TR0|they will sit around the table 
20101227144455.305|20101227144457.051|TR0|and nod their head as the 
20101227144457.051|20101227144458.798|TR0|general speaks. So, the 
20101227144458.798|20101227144500.544|TR0|bobblehead effect really is 
20101227144500.544|20101227144502.290|TR0|something that is sort of 
20101227144502.290|20101227144504.036|TR0|specific to the military. You 
20101227144504.036|20101227144505.783|TR0|have this deference to 
20101227144505.783|20101227144507.529|TR0|seniority, in a way that you 
20101227144507.529|20101227144509.275|TR0|don't elsewhere, that doesn't go 
20101227144509.275|20101227144511.022|TR0|away when a general or an 
20101227144511.022|20101227144512.768|TR0|admiral takes off their uniform.
20101227144512.768|20101227144514.514|TR0|
20101227144514.514|20101227144516.260|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Talk about the 
20101227144516.260|20101227144518.007|TR0|meeting that took place on the 
20101227144518.007|20101227144519.753|TR0|National Defense University's 
20101227144519.753|20101227144521.499|TR0|campus on the banks of the 
20101227144521.499|20101227144523.246|TR0|Potomac River in June of 2009, 
20101227144523.246|20101227144524.992|TR0|Bryan Bender.
20101227144524.992|20101227144526.738|TR0|
20101227144526.738|20101227144528.484|TR0|>> BRYAN BENDER: This was a 
20101227144528.484|20101227144530.231|TR0|meeting that the Army convened, 
20101227144530.231|20101227144531.977|TR0|the vice chief of staff of the 
20101227144531.977|20101227144533.723|TR0|Army convened. And the purpose 
20101227144533.723|20101227144535.470|TR0|was to lay out a strategy for 
20101227144535.470|20101227144537.216|TR0|the Army's future combat 
20101227144537.216|20101227144538.962|TR0|vehicle, something - a program 
20101227144538.962|20101227144540.708|TR0|called the ground combat 
20101227144540.708|20101227144542.455|TR0|vehicle, or GCV, which is a new 
20101227144542.455|20101227144544.201|TR0|program that is potentially 
20101227144544.201|20101227144545.947|TR0|worth billions of dollars for 
20101227144545.947|20101227144547.694|TR0|the defense contractors that 
20101227144547.694|20101227144549.440|TR0|will build it. And at this 
20101227144549.440|20101227144551.186|TR0|meeting, the Army invited about 
20101227144551.186|20101227144552.932|TR0|a hundred mostly government 
20101227144552.932|20101227144554.679|TR0|officials, military officers, 
20101227144554.679|20101227144556.425|TR0|congressional staffers. There 
20101227144556.425|20101227144558.171|TR0|were a few scholars there from 
20101227144558.171|20101227144559.918|TR0|think tanks or academia. Defense 
20101227144559.918|20101227144601.664|TR0|companies were not invited, 
20101227144601.664|20101227144603.410|TR0|because this was a very initial 
20101227144603.410|20101227144605.156|TR0|meeting laying out what some of 
20101227144605.156|20101227144606.903|TR0|the specifications might be for 
20101227144606.903|20101227144608.649|TR0|this new vehicle. They had not 
20101227144608.649|20101227144610.395|TR0|awarded a request for companies 
20101227144610.395|20101227144612.142|TR0|to respond to yet. But at the 
20101227144612.142|20101227144613.888|TR0|meeting were a bunch of retired 
20101227144613.888|20101227144615.634|TR0|Army generals. And it turns out 
20101227144615.634|20101227144617.380|TR0|that many of them are private 
20101227144617.380|20101227144619.127|TR0|industry consultants, including 
20101227144619.127|20101227144620.873|TR0|for the companies that later bid 
20101227144620.873|20101227144622.619|TR0|on the ground combat vehicle 
20101227144622.619|20101227144624.365|TR0|contract when it came out. And 
20101227144624.365|20101227144626.112|TR0|it was just one example that we 
20101227144626.112|20101227144627.858|TR0|came across of, again, this 
20101227144627.858|20101227144629.604|TR0|blurring of the lines. Here, you 
20101227144629.604|20101227144631.351|TR0|know, are a bunch of retired 
20101227144631.351|20101227144633.097|TR0|Army generals who are brought in 
20101227144633.097|20101227144634.843|TR0|because clearly they have a lot

20101227144638.336|20101227144640.082|TR0|for overseeing some very similar 
20101227144640.082|20101227144641.828|TR0|programs when they were in 
20101227144641.828|20101227144643.575|TR0|uniform - the Army seeking their 
20101227144643.575|20101227144645.321|TR0|advice, seeking their input, as 
20101227144645.321|20101227144647.067|TR0|they craft this new major

20101227144652.306|20101227144654.052|TR0|about, Bryan -

20101227144702.784|20101227144704.530|TR0|talk about who was there.
20101227144704.530|20101227144706.276|TR0|
20101227144706.276|20101227144708.023|TR0|>> BRYAN BENDER: Go ahead.
20101227144708.023|20101227144709.769|TR0|
20101227144709.769|20101227144711.515|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Retired Army 
20101227144711.515|20101227144713.261|TR0|Lieutenant General William H. 
20101227144713.261|20101227144715.008|TR0|Campbell, who oversaw all the 
20101227144715.008|20101227144716.754|TR0|Army's information systems 
20101227144716.754|20101227144718.500|TR0|before leaving the service in 
20101227144718.500|20101227144720.247|TR0|2000. Since 2002, he's been 
20101227144720.247|20101227144721.993|TR0|employed as a senior vice 
20101227144721.993|20101227144723.739|TR0|president at BAE Systems, one of 
20101227144723.739|20101227144725.485|TR0|the Army's primary weapons 
20101227144725.485|20101227144727.232|TR0|suppliers and a major bidder for 
20101227144727.232|20101227144728.978|TR0|the new ground combat vehicle. 
20101227144728.978|20101227144730.724|TR0|You emailed him. He wrote back 
20101227144730.724|20101227144732.471|TR0|it's not a conflict of interest 
20101227144732.471|20101227144734.217|TR0|because he's in the electronics 
20101227144734.217|20101227144735.963|TR0|division of BAE, not the ground 
20101227144735.963|20101227144737.709|TR0|combat division. Campbell, you 
20101227144737.709|20101227144739.456|TR0|say, and BAE declined to say how 
20101227144739.456|20101227144741.202|TR0|much, if any, of the electronics 
20101227144741.202|20101227144742.948|TR0|system in the new tank might be 
20101227144742.948|20101227144744.695|TR0|produced by Campbell's division 
20101227144744.695|20101227144746.441|TR0|at BAE. But Campbell suggested 
20101227144746.441|20101227144748.187|TR0|other generals at the meeting 
20101227144748.187|20101227144749.933|TR0|may have been skating closer to 
20101227144749.933|20101227144751.680|TR0|the edge. Like who, Bryan Bender?
20101227144751.680|20101227144753.426|TR0|
20101227144753.426|20101227144755.172|TR0|>> BRYAN BENDER: Well, there's a 
20101227144755.172|20101227144756.918|TR0|retired Army three-star general, 
20101227144756.918|20101227144758.665|TR0|Joseph Yakovac, who specialized 
20101227144758.665|20101227144800.411|TR0|in developing weapon systems 
20101227144800.411|20101227144802.157|TR0|just like this one when he was 
20101227144802.157|20101227144803.904|TR0|in the Army. And he's a 
20101227144803.904|20101227144805.650|TR0|consultant for the same company, 
20101227144805.650|20101227144807.396|TR0|BAE Systems, but specifically on 
20101227144807.396|20101227144809.142|TR0|this ground combat vehicle 
20101227144809.142|20101227144810.889|TR0|program.
20101227144810.889|20101227144812.635|TR0|
20101227144812.635|20101227144814.381|TR0|And this gets to the issue of 
20101227144814.381|20101227144816.128|TR0|disclosure. A lot of these 
20101227144816.128|20101227144817.874|TR0|generals will say, "Well, you 
20101227144817.874|20101227144819.620|TR0|know, when I was invited to this 
20101227144819.620|20101227144821.366|TR0|meeting, I had to fill out an 
20101227144821.366|20101227144823.113|TR0|ethics questionnaire." And many 
20101227144823.113|20101227144824.859|TR0|of them, if not all of them, did 
20101227144824.859|20101227144826.605|TR0|so, as far as I can tell, but 
20101227144826.605|20101227144828.352|TR0|that's where some people will 
20101227144828.352|20101227144830.098|TR0|come in and say, "Well, you know 
20101227144830.098|20101227144831.844|TR0|what? Yes, they filled out an 
20101227144831.844|20101227144833.590|TR0|ethics questionnaire, and 
20101227144833.590|20101227144835.337|TR0|presumably they told the truth, 
20101227144835.337|20101227144837.083|TR0|that they have a variety of 
20101227144837.083|20101227144838.829|TR0|defense industry clients or they 
20101227144838.829|20101227144840.576|TR0|plan to consult in the future on 
20101227144840.576|20101227144842.322|TR0|this very program that they're 
20101227144842.322|20101227144844.068|TR0|advising the Army on, but I 
20101227144844.068|20101227144845.814|TR0|cannot find an example where 
20101227144845.814|20101227144847.561|TR0|anyone in a situation like that 
20101227144847.561|20101227144849.307|TR0|has been precluded from 
20101227144849.307|20101227144851.053|TR0|participating in a panel like 
20101227144851.053|20101227144852.800|TR0|that." And that's where some of 
20101227144852.800|20101227144854.546|TR0|the critics will say the process 
20101227144854.546|20101227144856.292|TR0|is broken. There's a lot of 
20101227144856.292|20101227144858.038|TR0|paperwork these generals have to 
20101227144858.038|20101227144859.785|TR0|fill out. They file to the Army 
20101227144859.785|20101227144901.531|TR0|ethics questionnaires and 
20101227144901.531|20101227144903.277|TR0|nondisclosure agreements. But 
20101227144903.277|20101227144905.024|TR0|from what I can tell, in most 
20101227144905.024|20101227144906.770|TR0|cases, those documents get stuck 
20101227144906.770|20101227144908.516|TR0|in a drawer somewhere or on a 
20101227144908.516|20101227144910.262|TR0|computer hard drive and 
20101227144910.262|20101227144912.009|TR0|basically disappear. No one ever 
20101227144912.009|20101227144913.755|TR0|reviews them. No one ever says, 
20101227144913.755|20101227144915.501|TR0|"You know what? General Jack 
20101227144915.501|20101227144917.248|TR0|Smith, or whatever his name is, 
20101227144917.248|20101227144918.994|TR0|has these industry consulting 
20101227144918.994|20101227144920.740|TR0|clients and he's advising us on 
20101227144920.740|20101227144922.486|TR0|some very similar technologies. 
20101227144922.486|20101227144924.233|TR0|Maybe we shouldn't include him 
20101227144924.233|20101227144925.979|TR0|in this example." So, that's 
20101227144925.979|20101227144927.725|TR0|where public disclosure comes in.
20101227144927.725|20101227144929.471|TR0|
20101227144929.471|20101227144931.218|TR0|And I think most people will say 
20101227144931.218|20101227144932.964|TR0|the problem with these 
20101227144932.964|20101227144934.710|TR0|disclosure forms is that there's 
20101227144934.710|20101227144936.457|TR0|no way for the public to know 
20101227144936.457|20101227144938.203|TR0|who's working for whom, 
20101227144938.203|20101227144939.949|TR0|particularly if they're a 
20101227144939.949|20101227144941.695|TR0|consultant, and that, in the 
20101227144941.695|20101227144943.442|TR0|minds of some, there should be 
20101227144943.442|20101227144945.188|TR0|more disclosure, because at 
20101227144945.188|20101227144946.934|TR0|least there would be some 
20101227144946.934|20101227144948.681|TR0|sunlight on this process from 
20101227144948.681|20101227144950.427|TR0|the outside that might lead the 
20101227144950.427|20101227144952.173|TR0|Army and the other military 
20101227144952.173|20101227144953.919|TR0|services to do a better job of 
20101227144953.919|20101227144955.666|TR0|policing who is advising the 
20101227144955.666|20101227144957.412|TR0|military while they're also 
20101227144957.412|20101227144959.158|TR0|being paid by the very companies 
20101227144959.158|20101227145000.905|TR0|who could benefit from that 
20101227145000.905|20101227145002.651|TR0|advice.
20101227145002.651|20101227145004.397|TR0|
20101227145004.397|20101227145006.143|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: You mention 
20101227145006.143|20101227145007.890|TR0|retired General William S. 
20101227145007.890|20101227145009.636|TR0|Wallace, who ran the Army's 
20101227145009.636|20101227145011.382|TR0|Training and Doctrine Command 
20101227145011.382|20101227145013.129|TR0|before retiring in 2008, who 
20101227145013.129|20101227145014.875|TR0|said he wasn't representing one 
20101227145014.875|20101227145016.621|TR0|of the prospective bidders at 
20101227145016.621|20101227145018.367|TR0|the time of the meeting. Like 
20101227145018.367|20101227145020.114|TR0|the other participants, however, 
20101227145020.114|20101227145021.860|TR0|one of the ethics questions he 
20101227145021.860|20101227145023.606|TR0|was asked to answer, according 
20101227145023.606|20101227145025.353|TR0|to a blank copy, was whether he 
20101227145025.353|20101227145027.099|TR0|intended to consult in the 
20101227145027.099|20101227145028.845|TR0|future for a client that may 
20101227145028.845|20101227145030.591|TR0|have a direct interest in 
20101227145030.591|20101227145032.338|TR0|bidding on the new tank. Wallace 
20101227145032.338|20101227145034.084|TR0|didn't say how he answered that 
20101227145034.084|20101227145035.830|TR0|question. But explain what his 
20101227145035.830|20101227145037.577|TR0|job is now, Bryan Bender.
20101227145037.577|20101227145039.323|TR0|
20101227145039.323|20101227145041.069|TR0|>> BRYAN BENDER: Well, General 
20101227145041.069|20101227145042.815|TR0|Wallace, who, as you mention, 
20101227145042.815|20101227145044.562|TR0|ran the Training and Doctrine 
20101227145044.562|20101227145046.308|TR0|Command, which is basically the 
20101227145046.308|20101227145048.054|TR0|senior Army headquarters for 
20101227145048.054|20101227145049.801|TR0|determining what weapons and 
20101227145049.801|20101227145051.547|TR0|equipment the military - the 
20101227145051.547|20101227145053.293|TR0|Army should buy, he's now a 
20101227145053.293|20101227145055.039|TR0|private consultant. And one of 
20101227145055.039|20101227145056.786|TR0|his clients now is General 
20101227145056.786|20101227145058.532|TR0|Dynamics Land Systems Division, 
20101227145058.532|20101227145100.278|TR0|which is directly bidding on the 
20101227145100.278|20101227145102.024|TR0|ground combat vehicle program 
20101227145102.024|20101227145103.771|TR0|that he was brought to the 
20101227145103.771|20101227145105.517|TR0|National Defense University to 
20101227145105.517|20101227145107.263|TR0|advise on. And it gets to my 
20101227145107.263|20101227145109.010|TR0|earlier point. I have no reason 
20101227145109.010|20101227145110.756|TR0|to believe that General Wallace 
20101227145110.756|20101227145112.502|TR0|was, you know, untruthful in his 
20101227145112.502|20101227145114.248|TR0|ethics questionnaire. So when 
20101227145114.248|20101227145115.995|TR0|the question came up - "Do you 
20101227145115.995|20101227145117.741|TR0|have any plans or intention to 
20101227145117.741|20101227145119.487|TR0|consult for a company in the 
20101227145119.487|20101227145121.234|TR0|future that might have a stake 
20101227145121.234|20101227145122.980|TR0|in this program?" - it really 
20101227145122.980|20101227145124.726|TR0|doesn't matter what he said, 
20101227145124.726|20101227145126.472|TR0|whether he said yes or no, 
20101227145126.472|20101227145128.219|TR0|because obviously, in the end, 
20101227145128.219|20101227145129.965|TR0|it really didn't matter, because 
20101227145129.965|20101227145131.711|TR0|he soon thereafter went to work 
20101227145131.711|20101227145133.458|TR0|for General Dynamics Land 
20101227145133.458|20101227145135.204|TR0|Systems.
20101227145135.204|20101227145136.950|TR0|
20101227145136.950|20101227145138.696|TR0|And, you know, General Wallace 
20101227145138.696|20101227145140.443|TR0|and others I talked to will say, 
20101227145140.443|20101227145142.189|TR0|"Well, we signed a nondisclosure 
20101227145142.189|20101227145143.935|TR0|agreement before we went to this 
20101227145143.935|20101227145145.682|TR0|meeting, so, you know, we 
20101227145145.682|20101227145147.428|TR0|promised that whatever we learn 
20101227145147.428|20101227145149.174|TR0|here, whatever we find out, 
20101227145149.174|20101227145150.920|TR0|whatever this meeting is about, 
20101227145150.920|20101227145152.667|TR0|we will not share that with 
20101227145152.667|20101227145154.413|TR0|anyone else." But that gets to 
20101227145154.413|20101227145156.159|TR0|this other issue, which some 
20101227145156.159|20101227145157.906|TR0|others raised, which is, the 
20101227145157.906|20101227145159.652|TR0|policing mechanism basically is 
20101227145159.652|20101227145201.398|TR0|inside the brain of the general 
20101227145201.398|20101227145203.144|TR0|or admiral. As one put it, you 
20101227145203.144|20101227145204.891|TR0|have to have a firewall in your 
20101227145204.891|20101227145206.637|TR0|head. So you know some inside 
20101227145206.637|20101227145208.383|TR0|information, perhaps, that you 
20101227145208.383|20101227145210.130|TR0|got from a meeting like this or 
20101227145210.130|20101227145211.876|TR0|a variety of others in the 
20101227145211.876|20101227145213.622|TR0|Pentagon, but when you go to the 
20101227145213.622|20101227145215.368|TR0|boardroom or when you go meet 
20101227145215.368|20101227145217.115|TR0|with your client, you basically 
20101227145217.115|20101227145218.861|TR0|have to make sure that you don't 
20101227145218.861|20101227145220.607|TR0|download from one side of your 
20101227145220.607|20101227145222.354|TR0|brain to the other the 
20101227145222.354|20101227145224.100|TR0|information that you learned 
20101227145224.100|20101227145225.846|TR0|that you're not supposed to 
20101227145225.846|20101227145227.592|TR0|share with your client. And I 
20101227145227.592|20101227145229.339|TR0|think many will say that that's 
20101227145229.339|20101227145231.085|TR0|a minefield that is very 
20101227145231.085|20101227145232.831|TR0|difficult to walk. And that's 
20101227145232.831|20101227145234.577|TR0|why many people think that the 
20101227145234.577|20101227145236.324|TR0|generals shouldn't be in that 
20101227145236.324|20101227145238.070|TR0|position to begin with.
20101227145238.070|20101227145239.816|TR0|
20101227145239.816|20101227145241.563|TR0|And maybe one point I'll make, 
20101227145241.563|20101227145243.309|TR0|which is sort of a broader 
20101227145243.309|20101227145245.055|TR0|point: even the most concerned 
20101227145245.055|20101227145246.801|TR0|critics of this phenomenon and 
20101227145246.801|20101227145248.548|TR0|how it's grown, no one will say 
20101227145248.548|20101227145250.294|TR0|that, "Oh, the generals should 
20101227145250.294|20101227145252.040|TR0|just retire and go off to the 
20101227145252.040|20101227145253.787|TR0|golf course or sit in their 
20101227145253.787|20101227145255.533|TR0|rocking chair and smoke a 
20101227145255.533|20101227145257.279|TR0|corncob pipe." You know, many of 
20101227145257.279|20101227145259.025|TR0|them retire at 55, they're in 
20101227145259.025|20101227145300.772|TR0|great health, they've spent an 
20101227145300.772|20101227145302.518|TR0|enormous amount of years in the 
20101227145302.518|20101227145304.264|TR0|military, they certainly have an 
20101227145304.264|20101227145306.011|TR0|expertise that is valued. 
20101227145306.011|20101227145307.757|TR0|Everyone agrees that they're 
20101227145307.757|20101227145309.503|TR0|going to go do something, like 
20101227145309.503|20101227145311.249|TR0|in any other industry, which is 
20101227145311.249|20101227145312.996|TR0|their expertise. Where the real 
20101227145312.996|20101227145314.742|TR0|concern is is, again, the 
20101227145314.742|20101227145316.488|TR0|blurring of the lines. No one's 
20101227145316.488|20101227145318.235|TR0|saying they shouldn't go work 
20101227145318.235|20101227145319.981|TR0|for defense companies. But they 
20101227145319.981|20101227145321.727|TR0|probably shouldn't be also, in 
20101227145321.727|20101227145323.473|TR0|so many cases, advising the 
20101227145323.473|20101227145325.220|TR0|Pentagon on some of the very 
20101227145325.220|20101227145326.966|TR0|same issues that they're working 
20101227145326.966|20101227145328.712|TR0|on in the private sector.

20101227145346.175|20101227145347.921|TR0|the twice Pulitzer Prize-winning 
20101227145347.921|20101227145349.668|TR0|New York Times reporter, who 
20101227145349.668|20101227145351.414|TR0|exposed how dozens of retired 
20101227145351.414|20101227145353.160|TR0|generals working as radio and 
20101227145353.160|20101227145354.907|TR0|television analysts had been 
20101227145354.907|20101227145356.653|TR0|co-opted by the Pentagon to make 
20101227145356.653|20101227145358.399|TR0|its case for the war in Iraq and 
20101227145358.399|20101227145400.145|TR0|how many of them also had 
20101227145400.145|20101227145401.892|TR0|undisclosed ties to military 
20101227145401.892|20101227145403.638|TR0|contractors that benefited from 
20101227145403.638|20101227145405.384|TR0|policies they defended. This is

20101227145408.877|20101227145410.623|TR0|Pentagon officials developed 
20101227145410.623|20101227145412.369|TR0|this program during the lead-up

20101227145415.862|20101227145417.608|TR0|>> DAVID BARSTOW: The way to 
20101227145417.608|20101227145419.354|TR0|really influence the American 
20101227145419.354|20101227145421.101|TR0|public was to try and find 
20101227145421.101|20101227145422.847|TR0|people who were viewed as 
20101227145422.847|20101227145424.593|TR0|independent of both government 
20101227145424.593|20101227145426.340|TR0|and the media, people who were 
20101227145426.340|20101227145428.086|TR0|considered authoritative and 
20101227145428.086|20101227145429.832|TR0|expert, and people who would 
20101227145429.832|20101227145431.578|TR0|have an ability to cut through 
20101227145431.578|20101227145433.325|TR0|the spin.
20101227145433.325|20101227145435.071|TR0|
20101227145435.071|20101227145436.817|TR0|And the group that they began 
20101227145436.817|20101227145438.564|TR0|zeroing in on were all the 
20101227145438.564|20101227145440.310|TR0|military analysts who were being 
20101227145440.310|20101227145442.056|TR0|hired in droves after 9/11 by 
20101227145442.056|20101227145443.802|TR0|all the major TV networks. In 
20101227145443.802|20101227145445.549|TR0|the view of Torie Clarke and her 
20101227145445.549|20101227145447.295|TR0|staff, these guys were sort of 
20101227145447.295|20101227145449.041|TR0|the ultimate key influencers. 
20101227145449.041|20101227145450.788|TR0|They were seen as, most of them, 
20101227145450.788|20101227145452.534|TR0|retired decorated war heroes. 
20101227145452.534|20101227145454.280|TR0|They were, many of them, retired 
20101227145454.280|20101227145456.026|TR0|generals, some three- and 
20101227145456.026|20101227145457.773|TR0|four-star generals. They came 
20101227145457.773|20101227145459.519|TR0|from an institution that 
20101227145459.519|20101227145501.265|TR0|traditionally is extremely 
20101227145501.265|20101227145503.012|TR0|trusted by the American public. 
20101227145503.012|20101227145504.758|TR0|And they were seen by the public 
20101227145504.758|20101227145506.504|TR0|not really as of the media, but 
20101227145506.504|20101227145508.250|TR0|not of the government either.
20101227145508.250|20101227145509.997|TR0|
20101227145509.997|20101227145511.743|TR0|And so, in the fall of 2002, 
20101227145511.743|20101227145513.489|TR0|Torie Clarke and her aides, with 
20101227145513.489|20101227145515.236|TR0|the strong support from the 
20101227145515.236|20101227145516.982|TR0|White House and from her bosses, 
20101227145516.982|20101227145518.728|TR0|set out to target this group and 
20101227145518.728|20101227145520.474|TR0|to make them, really, one of the 
20101227145520.474|20101227145522.221|TR0|main vehicles for reaching the 
20101227145522.221|20101227145523.967|TR0|American public and building 
20101227145523.967|20101227145525.713|TR0|support for the war on terror. 
20101227145525.713|20101227145527.460|TR0|So that's how it sort of began, 
20101227145527.460|20101227145529.206|TR0|was with this idea that they 
20101227145529.206|20101227145530.952|TR0|could take this thing, this 
20101227145530.952|20101227145532.698|TR0|thing called the military 
20101227145532.698|20101227145534.445|TR0|analyst, which is a creature 
20101227145534.445|20101227145536.191|TR0|that's been around for a long 
20101227145536.191|20101227145537.937|TR0|time - going back to the first 
20101227145537.937|20101227145539.683|TR0|Gulf War, we remember some of 
20101227145539.683|20101227145541.430|TR0|the retired generals first 
20101227145541.430|20101227145543.176|TR0|coming on air - and they could 
20101227145543.176|20101227145544.922|TR0|take this and the fact of 9/11 
20101227145544.922|20101227145546.669|TR0|and the fact of how prevalent 
20101227145546.669|20101227145548.415|TR0|they were on air, sometimes 
20101227145548.415|20101227145550.161|TR0|appearing segment after segment 
20101227145550.161|20101227145551.907|TR0|after segment, getting more air 
20101227145551.907|20101227145553.654|TR0|time than many correspondents 
20101227145553.654|20101227145555.400|TR0|were getting, holding forth, not 
20101227145555.400|20101227145557.146|TR0|just on the issues of where the 
20101227145557.146|20101227145558.893|TR0|airplanes are flying and where 
20101227145558.893|20101227145600.639|TR0|the tanks are moving, but 
20101227145600.639|20101227145602.385|TR0|weighing more heavily on even 
20101227145602.385|20101227145604.131|TR0|the strategic issues of what 
20101227145604.131|20101227145605.878|TR0|should we do next and how should 
20101227145605.878|20101227145607.624|TR0|the war on terror unfold, what 
20101227145607.624|20101227145609.370|TR0|should be the next targets.
20101227145609.370|20101227145611.117|TR0|
20101227145611.117|20101227145612.863|TR0|And they looked at them as 
20101227145612.863|20101227145614.609|TR0|effectively what they were doing 
20101227145614.609|20101227145616.355|TR0|was writing the op-ed on air for 
20101227145616.355|20101227145618.102|TR0|the networks and for the cables. 
20101227145618.102|20101227145619.848|TR0|And they noticed the way the 
20101227145619.848|20101227145621.594|TR0|relationships between the 
20101227145621.594|20101227145623.341|TR0|anchors and their sort of 
20101227145623.341|20101227145625.087|TR0|in-house generals, there was a 
20101227145625.087|20101227145626.833|TR0|sort of bond between anchor and 
20101227145626.833|20101227145628.579|TR0|general. And you didn't see the 
20101227145628.579|20101227145630.326|TR0|kind of challenging questioning 
20101227145630.326|20101227145632.072|TR0|that would go on if you had 
20101227145632.072|20101227145633.818|TR0|sent, for example, a 
20101227145633.818|20101227145635.565|TR0|representative of the Pentagon 
20101227145635.565|20101227145637.311|TR0|to the TV station. It was a much 
20101227145637.311|20101227145639.057|TR0|more - almost fawning, in some 
20101227145639.057|20101227145640.803|TR0|cases, kind of relationship 
20101227145640.803|20101227145642.550|TR0|between anchor and general. So 
20101227145642.550|20101227145644.296|TR0|they saw this group, and they 
20101227145644.296|20101227145646.042|TR0|saw in this group a way of 
20101227145646.042|20101227145647.789|TR0|taking the media filter, which 
20101227145647.789|20101227145649.535|TR0|politicians are always so fond 
20101227145649.535|20101227145651.281|TR0|of complaining about, and 
20101227145651.281|20101227145653.027|TR0|turning the media filter into 
20101227145653.027|20101227145654.774|TR0|more of a media megaphone.
20101227145654.774|20101227145656.520|TR0|
20101227145656.520|20101227145658.266|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: That's the 
20101227145658.266|20101227145700.013|TR0|Pulitzer Prize-winning New York 
20101227145700.013|20101227145701.759|TR0|Times reporter David Barstow on 
20101227145701.759|20101227145703.505|TR0|his expose last year. Bryan 
20101227145703.505|20101227145705.251|TR0|Bender, you're the national 
20101227145705.251|20101227145706.998|TR0|security reporter for the Boston 
20101227145706.998|20101227145708.744|TR0|Globe, your final comment on 
20101227145708.744|20101227145710.490|TR0|this as you talk about the 
20101227145710.490|20101227145712.236|TR0|generals who become military 
20101227145712.236|20101227145713.983|TR0|contractors. In the media, they 
20101227145713.983|20101227145715.729|TR0|are rarely identified as such, 
20101227145715.729|20101227145717.475|TR0|simply as a retired general, 
20101227145717.475|20101227145719.222|TR0|even when they're pushing for 
20101227145719.222|20101227145720.968|TR0|some weapons system that their 
20101227145720.968|20101227145722.714|TR0|corporation will benefit from.
20101227145722.714|20101227145724.460|TR0|
20101227145724.460|20101227145726.207|TR0|>> BRYAN BENDER: Well, I think 
20101227145726.207|20101227145727.953|TR0|David's segment gets to this 
20101227145727.953|20101227145729.699|TR0|point of real angst that is 
20101227145729.699|20101227145731.446|TR0|growing within the military. And 
20101227145731.446|20101227145733.192|TR0|that is that the retired 
20101227145733.192|20101227145734.938|TR0|generals are sort of the moral 
20101227145734.938|20101227145736.684|TR0|exemplars of all the people 
20101227145736.684|20101227145738.431|TR0|coming up the ranks behind them, 
20101227145738.431|20101227145740.177|TR0|and if there is even the 
20101227145740.177|20101227145741.923|TR0|appearance of this conflict of 
20101227145741.923|20101227145743.670|TR0|interest, an appearance that 
20101227145743.670|20101227145745.416|TR0|they're doing something behind 
20101227145745.416|20101227145747.162|TR0|the scenes that they don't want 
20101227145747.162|20101227145748.908|TR0|public, they don't want 
20101227145748.908|20101227145750.655|TR0|disclosed, that has 
20101227145750.655|20101227145752.401|TR0|repercussions for the military. 
20101227145752.401|20101227145754.147|TR0|And there's not a whole lot of 
20101227145754.147|20101227145755.894|TR0|voices in the military that are 
20101227145755.894|20101227145757.640|TR0|saying that publicly just yet. 
20101227145757.640|20101227145759.386|TR0|There certainly are some retired 
20101227145759.386|20101227145801.132|TR0|generals who have told me about 
20101227145801.132|20101227145802.879|TR0|it. And again, I think it gets 
20101227145802.879|20101227145804.625|TR0|to the broader issue of what 
20101227145804.625|20101227145806.371|TR0|this trend means to the health 
20101227145806.371|20101227145808.118|TR0|of the officer corps. If 
20101227145808.118|20101227145809.864|TR0|everyone sees this conveyor belt 
20101227145809.864|20101227145811.610|TR0|that goes from the Pentagon to 
20101227145811.610|20101227145813.356|TR0|the private defense world, and a 
20101227145813.356|20101227145815.103|TR0|lot of it is not very public and 
20101227145815.103|20101227145816.849|TR0|it's not very transparent, the 
20101227145816.849|20101227145818.595|TR0|big question that some of them 
20101227145818.595|20101227145820.342|TR0|have is, does this erode what 
20101227145820.342|20101227145822.088|TR0|traditionally it's meant to be 
20101227145822.088|20101227145823.834|TR0|an officer in the United States 
20101227145823.834|20101227145825.580|TR0|military?
20101227145825.580|20101227145827.327|TR0|
20101227145827.327|20101227145829.073|TR0|>> AMY GOODMAN: Bryan Bender, I 
20101227145829.073|20101227145830.819|TR0|want to thank you for being with 
20101227145830.819|20101227145832.566|TR0|us. We'll link to your piece at

20101227145836.058|20101227145837.804|TR0|And that does it for our 
20101227145837.804|20101227145839.551|TR0|broadcast. Renowned physician 
20101227145839.551|20101227145841.297|TR0|and human rights activist Dr. 
20101227145841.297|20101227145843.043|TR0|Binayak Sen has been sentenced 
20101227145843.043|20101227145844.789|TR0|to life in prison in India. 
20101227145844.789|20101227145846.536|TR0|Amnesty International calls him 
20101227145846.536|20101227145848.282|TR0|a prisoner of conscience. We'll
